    <p>
     Agatha walked briskly through the lab building, her heels clicking sharply against the floor. She was late, and she liked it that way. The PhD students she was about to meet, the three who’d been assigned to her this year, would be sitting in the lab common room, fingers fidgeting, heart rates spiking as they waited for her. Good. She wanted them on edge. It was part of the process - the first lesson in survival. Let them stew in nerves for a while. Let them worry. It was an excellent way to see who could handle the heat, who could stand up to the pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had earned her reputation long ago. They called her
     <em>
      The Wicked Witch of Neuro.
     </em>
     Only behind her back, of course. She didn’t mind. It was true enough. She was tough, demanding, exacting. Those who couldn’t handle her methods didn’t last long, and those who did? Well, those were the ones who would thrive in the world of research. A world where people didn’t coddle you, didn’t pamper you, and certainly didn’t forgive incompetence. And besides, whatever people wanted to say about her behind her back, they also knew her reputation in academia. The 230 publications she had to her name, the 52 of those which were as primary author. She was good.
     <em>
      Very
     </em>
     good. And the students she supervised? They always, always received research grants for their next projects in the month after they received their PhD. Well, that is, if they survived through 3 years under Agatha first.
    </p>
    <p>
     She passed a few research fellows and MSc students as she walked. They all met her eye, then immediately glanced away and hurried past. She didn’t care. She relished it. The students she trained would have to learn to command respect, just as she had. Confidence, unwavering and unapologetic. That’s how you got ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her outfit was nothing unusual, yet it always made a statement. A crisp white shirt, tucked neatly into high-waisted purple trousers. Her black hair was pulled tightly into a bun at the back of her head, practical yet elegant. But it was the long blue lab coat, billowing behind her as she walked, that made her presence feel almost theatrical. She moved like she belonged in the space, like the lab was hers to command. Her stage. She liked that.
    </p>
    <p>
     She reached the entrance to the common area and paused for a moment, taking in the sight of the students through the glass door. Agatha had three students this year: Billy, Jennifer, and Alice. She made it a point to familiarize herself with their names and faces from the student list ahead of time, committing each detail to memory. It was a small but satisfying tactic. When she entered the room and called them by name without them uttering a word, it always caught them off guard. The sudden recognition, the feeling of being seen and scrutinised before they’d even spoken, it put her in control from the start. It was a subtle but effective way to assert her dominance and remind them that they were already under her watchful eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     The three of them were sitting on the worn sofas, their backs ramrod straight, eyes wide with nervous energy. They were right where she wanted them. It was almost too easy. She could feel their collective unease from here. Good. They were scared. They should be.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then, something caught her attention. There was a fourth student, someone she hadn’t expected. A girl, black-haired, sitting casually to one side of the room. Her legs were crossed, her posture completely relaxed, and she was twirling a pencil between her fingers with an air of boredom, or perhaps quiet amusement. Her lack of anxiety, her easy confidence, intrigued Agatha. She checked the student list in her mind, three students. Billy, Alice, Jennifer. This girl wasn’t supposed to be here. Interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
     The girl wore black tailored trousers and a white shirt, the sleeves rolled up around her elbows, unbuttoned just a bit too much for someone on their first day, revealing a hint of collarbone and a casualness that didn’t quite belong in this setting. Her dark hair fell softly around her face, framing it with an effortless, almost careless grace. Her makeup was simple but striking. Dark eyes, smoky and sharp, the kind of look that made her seem detached from the conventional expectations of professionalism. There was something about her, a subtle defiance, perhaps, that made Agatha take a second look. She wasn’t trying to impress in the way Agatha would have expected, and that, oddly enough, was what made her so interesting. Agatha made a mental note to figure out what the deal was with this mysterious addition to her cohort.
    </p>
    <p>
     For now, though, it was time to make her entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha opened the door, the soft click of the handle louder than it had any right to be in the stillness. All four students immediately snapped their heads toward her, eyes wide, like deer caught in headlights.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good morning," Agatha said coolly, scanning the room, her gaze deliberate as it flicked over each student, pausing just slightly longer on the black-haired girl. She could already feel the tension thickening. She was good at this. So good at reading people, at assessing them before they even spoke a word.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am Dr. Harkness,” she said, her voice cold and measured. She let the words hang in the air for a beat, watching as each student absorbed the weight of her name. Billy looked at her with an almost manic intensity, probably trying to read her. Alice, on the other hand, had the deer-in-headlights look she expected from most first-years. Jennifer seemed poised, but her rigid posture betrayed the anxiety that she was trying to conceal. And then there was the girl in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's eyes slid over her. Relaxed, almost too much so, and still with that knowing expression, twirling her pencil between her fingers with an air of confidence. Agatha narrowed her eyes for a fraction of a second before continuing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Welcome to the neuroscience PhD programme,” Agatha continued, her voice as harsh as ever. She could see Alice’s shoulders tense, the poor thing probably regretting her decision to come here already. Billy was leaning forward a bit too eagerly, trying to hide the nervous sweat beading on his forehead. Jennifer was trying to maintain control, her hands folded in her lap, but her eyes darted between the others and Agatha, as if waiting for the proverbial shoe to drop.
    </p>
    <p>
     The black-haired girl, however, didn’t seem to be as rattled. There was something about her, some subtle energy that made Agatha stop and take note. But this wasn’t the time to engage. She would get to her later. For now, the message had to be made clear to all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will be your supervisor for the next three years,” Agatha said slowly, giving the words weight, ensuring they registered. She allowed her eyes to move from one student to the next.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now, I’m sure you’re familiar with my reputation,” Agatha continued, her voice not changing in the slightest. “But if not, let me make it crystal clear to you. I do not tolerate incompetence.” She took a few deliberate steps toward the group, watching as they reacted. Billy trying to maintain eye contact, but with an almost desperate edge to his stare. Alice was looking at her from beneath her lashes, face pale but attentive. Jennifer was more composed but seemed to shrink under Agatha's steady gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am fair,” Agatha said, her tone sharpening slightly, “but my standards are high. I won’t coddle you, I won’t hold your hand and I won’t allow for repeated mistakes. Understand?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The room was so still now, Agatha could almost hear their hearts pounding in sync. She let the silence stretch on, savouring their discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This may sound harsh," she continued, her voice a little colder, as she leaned slightly against the back of a chair, surveying the students before her. “Think what you will, but the world of research is cutthroat. Millions of researchers competing for the same funding, the same grants, the same awards." Her eyes flicked to each of them in turn. "You think that being here means you’re special? No. It means you’ve been given a chance. But chances are fleeting. They disappear when you fail.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The words hung in the air, heavy with meaning. Agatha could feel the collective breath being held, could see the way Jennifer's knuckles whitened as she gripped the edge of the sofa. Billy’s chest was rising and falling faster now, while Alice remained still, almost too still. Agatha’s eyes finally flicked back to the girl, she was still twirling that pencil. There was something there. A glimmer of an expression. Respect? Admiration? Something like that. It was subtle, perhaps she thought Agatha wouldn’t notice. Her gaze locked on the girl for a moment, a flicker of something passing between them. The girl didn’t flinch. Fascinating.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The first thing you’ll learn here is that this lab is not a place for weaklings,” Agatha said, her voice firm and unwavering. "You want to make it to the top? Then you’ll need to work harder, think sharper, and fight for every inch. This is not a game."
    </p>
    <p>
     She paused, her eyes catching the girl’s once more. The pencil twirled faster, and Agatha couldn’t help but feel a little curious. This one would either be an asset or a liability, and she wasn’t sure which yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha savoured the moment, a quiet thrill humming beneath her cool exterior. She loved the theatre of it all. The heavy silences, the charged glances, the palpable tension she could almost taste. This first impression was a carefully constructed ritual, a performance she had perfected over the years. It was her stage, and each nervous shift, every hesitant glance from her students, was proof of her control. Her students were on edge. Right where she wanted them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, all except the black-haired girl. She sat there, calm and composed. She wore an infuriating smirk which had been plastered on her face throughout Agatha’s speech. Agatha should be annoyed, but rather than unsettle her, the girl’s defiance was a thrill. A challenge wrapped in quiet rebellion. It excited her, this rare flash of resistance. She would break her soon enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I expect excellence. Anything less, and you’ll find yourself out of your depth." She straightened, her mouth curving into a smirk as she clasped her hands together. “Right, so, you will be either in the lab or analysing data for most of your time until you start to write up your research. Your schedule is up to you. You’re grown-ups, you can manage your own time.’
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s lips twisted into a sarcastic smile as she let her gaze settle on the black-haired girl, still so infuriatingly relaxed. "But, of course," she began, her tone laced with dry amusement and her hands curling into a dramatic flourish, "when I was doing my PhD, I was spending all my time in the lab. I stayed well past sunset most days, and I assure you, I had little time for... other pursuits.” Her eyes swept over the group, watching as their shoulders tensed further.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s gaze flicked back to the girl, who hadn’t moved an inch, still looking at her with that infuriating smirk. She raised an eyebrow. “But, I suppose,” she continued smoothly, her voice rich with sarcasm, “if you’d rather be doing something else, that’s fine.” Agatha paused to snicker loudly, as if she was amused by what she was about to say “I’m sure the world of research will be... very forgiving for that kind of behaviour.” She let the words linger, letting their weight settle over them all.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The only scheduled time you need to spend here” Agatha continued, her voice steady and cold, “is two sessions per week, about 2 hours each, with me, assisting with my current research, it—”
    </p>
    <p>
     But then, Jennifer’s hand shot up. Agatha suppressed an annoyed sigh, her gaze hardening as she looked at her. She hated being interrupted. “Yes, Jennifer?” she said coolly, watching the shock ripple through them all as they registered that she already knew their names. She allowed herself a small, smirk. Her tactic had worked beautifully.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, um, I actually prefer to go by Jen,” Jennifer stammered, clearly thrown by Agatha’s familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What was your question, Jennifer?” Agatha replied, her voice icily unyielding. She could see Jennifer falter, her mouth opening and closing as she scrambled to regain her confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I just wanted to say…” Jennifer took a shaky breath. “I’ve read your research proposal for your current project…on depression in early life as a risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s. It’s just groundbreaking. Really, it’s incredible.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s mouth twitched as a sharp irritation settled in. There was always one—the inevitable suck-up, the overeager devotee who thought a few compliments would put them in her good graces. They never seemed to understand just how little flattery impressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a deliberate step towards them, letting her gaze sweep over the other students. “See what Jennifer did just then?” she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “She interrupted me, with no apparent question, just to... suck up. Do not do that.” She levelled her gaze at each of them in turn, pausing on Jennifer, who had gone beet red. “If you have an actual, intellectual question about my research, please, be my guest. But reading the abstract of my paper does not get you any points here. It’s, like, the first thing that comes up if you search my name on the university website.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s gaze swept over the students, landing on the black-haired girl. She noted the subtle lift of her eyebrow, the faint smirk tugging at the corner of her mouth. She looked almost impressed. There was a glint of admiration in her eyes, as if she recognised Agatha’s performance for what it was and, against her better judgment, appreciated it. Good, Agatha thought with a flicker of satisfaction, one that she quickly smothered, If the girl wanted a show, she’d come to the right place. This one might prove to be more intriguing than she’d anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha flicked her gaze back to Jennifer, who now looked like she wanted the ground to swallow her right then and there. “I do not care that you think my research is groundbreaking,” she said, a hint of amusement tugging at her lips. “I know it’s groundbreaking. Everything I do is groundbreaking.”
    </p>
    <p>
     With flourish of her long lab coat, she began to strut out the door, calling ‘Come. Follow me.’ Agatha listened with pure delight as they scrambled up behind her, not wanting to fall behind and risk Agatha’s wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they walked briskly down the corridor, Agatha spoke, her tone cool and unwavering. "As I was saying before I was interrupted” she cast a pointed look at Jennifer, who shrank back slightly, “You will have two sessions per week dedicated to my research. These will either be lectures from me - the lecture hall is upstairs; I’ll see you there for the first one tomorrow - or hands-on research assistance in the lab."
    </p>
    <p>
     They rounded a corner, and Agatha held the door open as the group started down a flight of stairs. “I’m taking you to the lab now,” she continued, her voice echoing through the stairwell. “It’s where you should be spending most of your time. The lab operates under standard protocols. If, for some reason, you are unsure of these protocols, do not ask me. I’m not here to spoon-feed you information you should already know. Find the handbook and study up if you’ve somehow forgotten your basic lab skills.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They reached a long hallway lined with doors, and Agatha gestured to a few rooms as they passed. “This is a study space,” she said. “You can use it for data analysis if you need somewhere other than the lab to work. These next rooms contain microscopes, you can bring your slides and study them here if you wish. We have an electron microscope in the main lab, but if you just need a light microscope, these should work fine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She led them down a different corridor, pointing out a series of rooms. “Down here, we have neuroimaging machines: two MRIs, two CT scanners, and three EEGs. However-” she added with a wave of her hand, “our lab is home to the largest brain bank for neurodegenerative diseases in all of Europe. So, it’s your choice if you want to use neuroimaging, but personally, I’d recommend post-mortem samples if you don’t want to waste the resource which has just..” she added a flourish of her hand “fallen into your laps.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She abruptly stopped in her tracks, causing the students behind her to stumble and nearly collide as she turned to face them. Agatha crossed her arms, her gaze sharp. "Can anyone tell me the advantages and disadvantages of post-mortem studies over using clinical evidence?"
    </p>
    <p>
     A tense silence fell over the group as Billy, Alice, and Jennifer exchanged panicked glances. Agatha’s expression hardened; she was unimpressed. This was bog-standard evaluation. They teach this to 17 year olds in A-level Psychology for god’s sake!
    </p>
    <p>
     But then, the black-haired girl stepped forward, her voice steady and confident as her smirk grew. “Post-mortem brain donations allow for a more detailed study of brain tissue without the ethical limitations of studying a living patient. You can isolate deeper structures within the brain, and you can use stains to test for chemical markers that can’t be detected through neuroimaging.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, impressed despite herself, though she opened her mouth to remind the girl that she’d also asked about the disadvantages. But before she could speak, the girl continued.
    </p>
    <p>
     “—but, the brain is dead,” the girl added, as if reading Agatha’s mind. “Meaning you can’t study activity in real time or see how specific tasks activate different brain areas, which you could with EEGs or fMRIs.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt a small surge of approval. She was about to speak, but then the girl went on, seemingly unfazed by the attention and deep in thought. Agatha could practically see the cogs whirring in her mind “Though, I guess for neurodegeneration research, dementia in particular, it’s neuroanatomy and neurochemistry that matter most. Finding a neurobiological basis for these disorders would likely be genetic, neuroanatomical, or neurochemical. Imaging techniques like MRIs or CTs wouldnt be as effective for that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     For the first time, Agatha allowed a faint smile to cross her lips. “Precisely,” she said, her voice low but approving. “Well done.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The girl, rather than showing relief or shrinking back like the others, simply widened her smirk. An expression so confident, so unapologetically bold, that it was almost as if she hadn’t expected nor cared about the praise. The girl’s audacity, her calm self-assurance, sparked something in Agatha, a rare flash of genuine respect. There was intelligence here, yes, but also a boldness, a quiet confidence that she hadn’t encountered in years. This one might be something special, Agatha thought, her intrigue deepening. She’d set out to put her new cohort on edge, to see who would falter, who could withstand the pressure. And already, it was clear, this girl wasn’t just holding her ground, she was thriving under it
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded to the black-haired girl, acknowledging her sharp answer, before turning and continuing her strut down the corridor. “At our lab's brain bank,” she began, her voice taking on a matter-of-fact tone, “we collect about six donations a week, give or take. These are individuals with neurodegenerative diseases, mostly Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, who choose to donate their brains to research after they die.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She reached the door to the lab, pushing it open with a flourish. “This,” she said, sweeping her arm to the left, “is the lab.” The space stretched out before them, a vast expanse with rows of workstations, equipment, and research areas that seemed to go on forever. The students stared, wide-eyed with awe. Even the black-haired girl couldn’t entirely suppress a small, appreciative smile at the sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha continued, clearly relishing their reaction. “On the right,” she said, gesturing again, “is what we call ‘the room of doom.’” She activated an automatic sliding door, revealing a room filled with freezers on one side and shelves stacked with what appeared to be white buckets.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stupid name, really,” Agatha admitted with a scoff. “But it’s where we store all the brain donations.” She shrugged. “When the donations come in, we split the hemispheres. One is fixed in formalin,’ Agatha gestured to the white buckets lining one wall, “this makes it easier to study the neuroanatomy. The other hemisphere is dissected fresh and then frozen.” She gestured to the line of freezers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused for a moment, “Now, I don’t really expect anyone to know this, but—” she eyed them, her gaze particularly sharp on the black-haired girl, “—take a guess. When would you use frozen samples instead of fixed ones? The frozen ones are much more inconvenient. They melt within minutes of coming out of the freezer and start to decompose. So really, they’re just a pain to work with. But why might we still use them?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She watched as the students exchanged uncertain glances. Her eyes locked on the black-haired girl. Agatha raised an eyebrow, sensing the girl was onto something but hadn’t quite pieced it together yet. She could see the realisation dawning as the girl thought through the possibilities, and Agatha gave her a small nod, silently urging her to speak up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Genetic testing,” the girl said after a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s expression shifted to one of surprise and admiration. She nodded, the smallest smile tugging at her lips. “Yes, very good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The black-haired girl began to explain further. “The formalin used to fix the brain limits the DNA you can extract from the cells—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could continue, Jennifer, unable to resist the urge to jump in, cut her off. “Freezing the brain preserves the genetic material! So, you can use it for genetic testing!” she said, with an overly eager tone, as if she’d just solved the problem herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze for a moment, shocked at the interruption, and then let out a sharp laugh. She had seen it happen before, one of those students who liked to steal someone else’s thunder, without even understanding the question in the first place. Jennifer had had no idea when Agatha first asked. She just heard the start of the other girl’s answer and ran with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The black-haired girl shot Jennifer an incredulous look, her gaze turning into a glare of utter disdain. Agatha gave her a subtle, almost approving glance, amused by the girl's reaction. The girl, for her part, simply smirked, looking between Jennifer and Agatha, almost as if to silently say,
     <em>
      Can you believe that just happened?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked back, choosing not to dignify Jennifer’s interruption with a response. She made eye contact with the black-haired girl, her voice dripping with approval as she said, “Excellent. I’m impressed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The girl nodded, flashing one last glare at Jennifer as Agatha moved on, her tone shifting to one of business. “Now, take a look around. Choose your workstation, lay out anything you might need for tomorrow. We’re done here for today. I expect to see you in the lab early tomorrow. My lecture starts at 11, but if you want to get a head start on your projects, it would benefit you to get here as early as possible. I want to see your project titles and a rough abstract in the next two weeks. The sooner you get started, the better.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As the other students wandered off to their chosen workstations, settling in and arranging their materials with a mix of excitement and uncertainty, the black-haired girl lingered behind. She leaned casually against the doorframe of the lab entrance, her smirk still firmly in place, watching Agatha with a sort of bemused defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, her gaze narrowing slightly. "You," she said, pointing a finger directly at the girl, her voice firm.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Me," she replied, her smirk only widening, her low tone almost mocking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilted her head slightly, her curiosity piqued but irritation bubbling under the surface. “You weren’t on my student list. Who are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     "I’m Rio," the girl said with a casual lift of her chin, before performing a playful, exaggerated curtsey, lifting an imaginary skirt with mock elegance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, unfazed by the theatrics. "So what, you don’t have a last name?" she said, emphasizing each syllable as she repeated, "Rio?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood up straight from her exaggerated bow and, without missing a beat, replied, "Rio Vidal. And I was transferred from a different PhD supervisor yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyebrow arched skeptically. "Transferred, huh? So, what? You changed your mind about your topic last minute? You were in a different specialty and suddenly decided you wanted to dive into neurodegeneration? You should know that I don’t tolerate indecisiveness. It’s a sign of weakness. I want my students to be driven and to know exactly what they want."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s laughter filled the room, a smooth, confident sound that seemed to irk Agatha. "Trust me when I say there is no one more driven than me, don’t you worry your pretty little head," Rio said with an almost teasing edge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s jaw tightened, feeling a flash of anger surge through her. The girl’s confidence was impressive but she was overstepping her boundaries by a mile. "How dare you—" Agatha began, her voice laced with venom.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sorry, Dr. Harkness," Rio interrupted smoothly, her voice dripping with feigned seriousness, though her smirk only deepened. "But genuinely, I’ve wanted to go into neurodegeneration research since I was taking my A-levels. I’m driven. I was under a different neurodegeneration researcher for my project, but my course director, Professor Calderu, swapped me to you. She said my talent would be wasted under any other supervisor."
    </p>
    <p>
     She shrugged as though it was all no big deal, but Agatha’s eyes narrowed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another scoff slipped past Agatha’s lips before she could stop it. "Wow, a little cocky, aren’t we?" she said, crossing her arms over her chest, her eyes studying Rio with growing amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head slightly, an eyebrow cocked in quiet challenge, but she only shrugged yet again. This air of nonchalance was beginning to really annoy Agatha. "Those were Professor Calderu's exact words. I don’t know what else to tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t help but admit, begrudgingly, that the name Professor Lilia Calderu meant something. Lilia had been the neuroscience program director for the BSc, MSc, and PhD programs for the university for over forty years. Agatha had worked alongside Lilia for the better part of two decades, and the woman was a genius. If she believed this girl was truly special... well, Agatha had to at least consider the possibility.

     This was starting to get interesting.

    <p>
     The morning was quiet as Agatha made her way through the chill, her breath visible in the crisp autumn air. She arrived at the lab just as dawn’s golden hues began to reflect off the city, pulling her purple scarf a little closer around her neck, the soft wool a welcome barrier against the cold. Her outfit mirrored yesterday's - high waisted purple trousers and white shirt - but she’d added a white knit sweater over her shirt for extra warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
     She made her way toward the coffee cart by the entrance, savouring the quiet that came with an early start, when the bustling campus was still asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slowed, surprised. Rio Vidal was already here, leaning against the cart with a lazy confidence, her hair catching the breeze, hands in her pockets. Agatha’s brow arched.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had told her students to come in early, but this early? The sun had barely risen. Rio’s presence stirred something beyond mere curiosity; the girl had a talent for the unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dr. Harkness!” Rio called, her smirk lifting as if they were already sharing some private joke.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her outfit was striking: dark green wide-legged trousers paired with a loose black button-up, rolled up to the elbows, a sleek and effortlessly stylish choice. Agatha noted it suited her exceptionally well, though she couldn't help noticing the shiver in Rio's shoulders. "Morning, Rio. Where’s your coat?” Agatha asked, her voice as brisk as the air. “You’re freezing.” She turned to the barista. “Cappuccino, please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scowled. “I left it at home. The tube’s always so hot that I didn’t realise until I got out here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitated. She wasn’t one to show any affection, and this one in particular needed a firm hand. But something about Rio’s shivering form softened her resolve. Rio noticed the look and raised an eyebrow, her smirk growing, as if daring Agatha to break character. With a huff, Agatha unwound her scarf and handed it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “As soon as we’re inside, I want that back,” she said, rolling her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's smirk transformed into an exaggerated look of surprise, her eyes glinting and her hand rising to her chest to clutch imaginary pearls. “Dr. Harkness! Well I’ll be. That seemed almost like… kindness?” She teased as she wrapped the scarf around herself, her shoulders visibly relaxing into its warmth. Agatha scoffed, fixing her with a sharp glare.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Never. I just don’t want you getting frostbite and losing all your fingers. How would you help me with my research then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed - a genuine, light laugh that broke through the cold, catching Agatha off guard as the girl flexed her hands. “Oh, of course, my mistake. I’ll be sure to keep them frostbite-free just for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     When their drinks arrived, they fell into step together, heading inside as the breeze carried the scent of coffee and fallen leaves around them. They walked in comfortable silence for a few moments, sipping their coffee as the early morning light cast long shadows across the lab building’s polished floors. Then Rio broke the quiet with a surprisingly earnest tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dr. Harkness, I have a question about your research.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glanced at her, eyebrow raised. “Ask away.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio paused, looking as if she were about to dive into some deep, thoughtful inquiry, but then her lips curled into a smirk. “I just wanted to tell you how absolutely
     <em>
      groundbreaking
     </em>
     I found it,” she said, imitating Jennifer’s overly eager tone from yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, shaking her head. “Don’t even,” she warned, though she couldn’t suppress her smile. Rio’s laughter was bright and unguarded, echoing softly in the hallway as they walked.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a moment, Rio cleared her throat, her tone shifting to something more thoughtful. “Alright, alright, I did have an actual question.” She looked at Agatha with a seriousness that made her curiosity feel all the more genuine. “If, as you hypothesise, depression is an early-life risk factor for Alzheimer’s… would that risk change if the depression was treated? Using CBT, say, or some other form of therapy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked, slightly taken aback by the insightfulness of Rio’s question.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio continued, her gaze unwavering. “What I mean is, do you think the risk factor lies in the actual experience of depression? Or is it more about having depression in the first place, like there’s some genetic factor involved?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took a slow sip of her coffee, collecting her thoughts. “That’s an excellent question, actually. It’s something I’m still figuring out,” she said, a glint of respect in her eyes as she looked at Rio. “There’s evidence suggesting it’s both. The genetic component was what I had originally thought, that maybe something in the gene for depression was linked to the gene for Alzheimer’s. But then we did a study that showed that how severe someone’s depression is, is actually correlated to how severe the Alzheimer’s would be. That suggests it’s more complicated than just… if you have one, you have the other.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded thoughtfully, processing the answer. “So that means if a person’s depression is treated and managed, it could potentially lower their risk?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s possible,” Agatha replied, warming to the discussion. “The theory is that interventions, like CBT or drug treatments, might mitigate some of the damage that increases Alzheimer’s risk. But that’s what we’re hoping to confirm through this research.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, her expression thoughtful. “I didn’t expect the connection to be so direct,” she admitted, glancing at Agatha. “That you could potentially prevent Alzheimer’s by addressing mental health decades earlier.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt a flicker of pride. Rio might have her sarcastic edge, but it was clear she had an agile mind, one that didn’t shy away from complexity. “This is the frontier, Rio. It’s all uncharted territory.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uncharted territory,” Rio repeated softly, a smile playing on her lips. She glanced at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched, the sincerity in Rio’s eyes catching her off guard. For a moment, they just looked at each other, caught in a moment of understanding that felt like it stretched beyond research and data. Finally, Agatha broke the gaze, clearing her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let’s see if you’re still this intrigued once you’re actually elbow-deep in data with the rest of us,” she replied, aiming for nonchalance.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hold on. So you’re telling me there’s actually serious work in research? And here I was thinking you just liked bossing us around," Rio teased, her smirk widening as she glanced at Agatha from beneath her dark lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled, though she felt a strange warmth creeping into her cheeks. "Trust me, I do. And you, Rio, are a prime candidate for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     "Glad to be of service," Rio shot back with a salute, her grin wide. They reached the lab, and for a moment, Agatha lingered by the door, caught in Rio’s gaze longer than she intended.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright,” she said, stepping aside and motioning for Rio to enter first. “Now, hand over my scarf.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed dramatically, unwrapping it and handing it back, her fingers brushing Agatha's as she did. “As you wish,” she murmured, her tone teasing, but her eyes held something deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took the scarf, feeling the warmth where Rio had held it. As Rio made her way over to one of the lab benches Agatha called from behind her "Now, time to start brainstorming. Your PhD topic is one of the most important decisions of your career. I’m excited to see what you come up with."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gave a small, resolute nod, her usual smirk replaced by a quiet determination. Without further comment, she pulled her chair closer to the bench where a stack of microscope slides and autopsy reports from the patients who had given the donations sat. Agatha’s brow furrowed. She was certain those hadn’t been there when she’d left the students at their stations the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Had Rio already gotten out the cases to look at? Had she been already digging into the material before her first official day of research? Agatha’s mind raced in a mix of curiosity and disbelief. Most students would wait for the formal start of their research, would take time to review the lab’s resources and perhaps ask for guidance before diving in. But Rio? No, she didn’t seem the type to follow any prescribed order.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stayed by the doorway, observing as Rio pulled her chair close and immediately began examining each microscope slide in turn, flipping through the thick binder of autopsy reports with a quiet determination. There was no hint of the usual smirk or sarcasm; instead, Rio’s face held an intense, thoughtful focus. Agatha stood there a moment longer, something about the quiet resolve in Rio’s expression making her linger before she finally turned and headed to her own desk on the other side of the lab.
    </p>
    <p>
     She settled into her chair, trying to direct her attention to the work waiting for her. But every few seconds, she found herself glancing up, catching little glimpses of Rio in her calm, meticulous process.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio began examining each microscope slide in turn. Agatha lingered a moment, watching as Rio opened a thick binder of autopsy reports, her eyes darting between the pages and slides, making notes in quick, slanted handwriting. Agatha knew she should get back to her own work, but something about Rio’s focused expression kept drawing her attention. Gone was the playful smirk, the unguarded sarcasm, here was a different side of Rio. Calm, intensely focused, and utterly immersed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every few seconds, Agatha glanced over, unable to fully ignore her student’s unusual concentration. Rio’s fingers deftly adjusted each slide under the microscope, her brows slightly furrowed in thought as she read through the patients' histories. She looked up once, catching Agatha watching her. For a brief second, Rio’s mouth curled into a faint smirk before she turned back to the reports, as if absorbing Agatha's silent attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     After some time, Rio spoke, her voice quiet yet assured. “Alzheimer’s affects only the lower regions of the hippocampus, right? CA2, CA3, and CA4?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was slightly surprised by the question, they had been silent for almost an hour. “Yes, primarily. A study I did a few years ago showed that those regions show the earliest signs of neurodegeneration. The rest are somewhat spared.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, seemingly filing away the information, her eyes still on the report in her hand. “Got it,” she murmured, almost to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the hours passed, Agatha continued her own work, occasionally stealing glances across the lab. She noted the careful precision in Rio’s movements, the way her lips pressed together in a subtle frown as she scribbled down observations. She’d seen plenty of students go through this stage nervous, uncertain. But Rio’s poise intrigued her. There was something uniquely captivating about her when she was fully absorbed, different from the sarcastic girl she’d met on her first day.
    </p>
    <p>
     By mid-morning, as sunlight began to filter through the lab’s high windows, the door swung open and the rest of the students trickled in. Billy, Jen, and Alice entered, each one greeting Agatha with a mix of apprehension and respect before settling into their own stations. They exchanged a few curious glances toward Rio, who was too engrossed in her work to notice. Agatha, however, did notice.
    </p>
    <p>
     The clock ticked away in the background, leaving Agatha with a few more minutes before her lecture began. The lab had settled into a hum of concentration, with Rio hardly lifting her head from the slides and reports spread before her. The other students were scattered across their workstations, but Agatha could feel their eyes on Rio as they exchanged glances, their curiosity piqued by the girl who had already been there when they arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy was the one to break the silence. Agatha could barely hear his voice across the lab, but she caught the words clearly enough. "How long have you been here, Rio?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Without looking up, Rio’s voice floated across the room. "Since 7.30."
    </p>
    <p>
     The others looked stunned. Alice, her voice rising slightly in disbelief, added, "Wow, that early? Well, we messaged you to ask if you wanted to carpool…we all came together."
    </p>
    <p>
     Only then did Rio lift her gaze, glancing at Alice with a raised eyebrow and a smirk that said it all. "I didn’t reply for a reason," she said, her voice cool. "I have no interest in showing up at 10 a.m. I’m here to actually do work."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had to admit, she was impressed. There was no hesitation in Rio’s tone, no need to justify herself. She simply stated it as a fact, as though it were the most natural thing in the world to show up early and just get to work.
    </p>
    <p>
     The others, however, seemed less than impressed. Jen rolled her eyes and huffed. "What, You think you’re so much better than us, huh? Is that it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice shot Jen a quick glare, putting a hand on her arm. "Jen, lay off her," she said quietly, trying to smooth over the tension. Billy chimed in next. "Yeah, that’s probably not what she meant, right, Rio?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t help but glance over. She had only met Rio yesterday, but she had an inkling of how the girl was about to respond. Just as Rio opened her mouth, a glint of mischief in her eyes, Agatha stepped in.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lecture time, everyone. Let’s head upstairs. Now."
    </p>
    <p>
     Her tone left no room for argument, and with that, the conversation fizzled out. Agatha watched as Rio glanced over, giving her a look that was half surprise, half amusement. But there was no time for further words. The students, still a little on edge from the exchange, began to gather their things and move toward the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha waited a moment, letting the room settle before following them. She couldn’t shake the thought of Rio, her calm demeanour now matching the cool confidence she had displayed earlier. There was something about her that made Agatha’s attention linger, but she quickly pushed the thought aside. It was time for work.
    </p>
    <p>
     — — —
    </p>
    <p>
     As they entered the lecture hall, Rio was struck by its unremarkable size. It was small, barely seating 30 people, but it felt intimate, the kind of room where every word would echo, and every gaze would be felt. The other students filed in, taking their seats with an air of nervous anticipation. Rio, however, felt strangely detached from the tension in the room. She chose a seat toward the back, leaning into the chair with an ease that almost seemed to mock the others, who sat with their backs as straight as possible, no doubt trying to impress Dr. Harkness.
     <em>
      Try-hards
     </em>
     , Rio thought with a small smirk, folding her arms and letting her eyes wander.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. Harkness had moved to the front of the room, already setting up her laptop and preparing to give her presentation. Other unfamiliar faces trickled in - academics, other researchers, no doubt curious about the research being presented, or perhaps just about Dr. Harkness herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning everyone.” Dr Harkness started, her voice firm. Rio’s gaze lingered on her, her focus shifting in a way that felt almost instinctive. She admired how Dr. Harkness commanded the room. It wasn’t just her words, or even her research; it was the way she moved, the way she held herself. As the lights dimmed and the first slide appeared, Dr. Harkness turned to the audience, already projecting a kind of power and authority.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Today, I’ll be presenting my work on the potential link between early-life depression and the risk of Alzheimer’s," Dr. Harkness began, her voice steady and commanding. "As we know, depression affects a significant portion of the population, but the question of how depression may influence the onset of Alzheimer’s has been a topic of considerable debate in the scientific community."
    </p>
    <p>
     "So, I have been studying this theory for years. My research has found evidence for a correlation between early-life depression and an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s later in life. However, the exact neural correlates have remained relatively unknown. Until now."
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, Dr. Harkness clicked again changing to a slide which displayed brain scans with highlighted areas of the hippocampus (the area of the brain responsible for memory). The audience leaned in as she continued, her voice never wavering. "What we’ve discovered is that depression, particularly when it occurs in early adulthood, seems to accelerate atrophy in the hippocampus-”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s attention shifted away from the slides, the lecture fading into the background as her focus shifted back to the woman at the front of the room. She couldn’t help but admire the way Dr. Harkness
     <em>
      performed
     </em>
     in front of the room, her hand gestures exaggerated just enough to emphasise each point she made, her voice pitch-perfect with the right amount of emphasis on every key word. It was almost like an art. Each move, each glance, every deliberate pause building tension and focus. Rio found herself captivated, not just by the research, but by the woman giving the lecture.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s mind wandered back to earlier, to that moment in the cold outside the lab, when she had taken off her scarf and handed it to Rio. It had been such a small gesture, but something about it had shattered the icy facade that Dr Harkness seemed to keep so carefully in place. That moment, when she had almost softened, had been the first time Rio saw her as more than just a rigid academic. There was something behind those sharp eyes, something that Rio hadn’t expected, and it sent a shiver down her spine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze remained fixed on Dr. Harkness as the lecture continued, but Rio wasn’t really listening anymore. She was too caught up in the Dr Harkness moved, the way her lips parted just slightly as she spoke, the faint rise and fall of her chest with each inhale. She wasn’t sure why, but she couldn’t tear her eyes away. There was a magnetic pull that the woman exerted without even realising it, something that made Rio’s pulse quicken in the most unexpected way.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Dr Harkness continued, Rio’s mind drifted again, recalling the way Agatha had held herself that morning. Assertive, controlled, unyielding in her usual manner, but with that crack, however small, of something more.
     <em>
      What is it about you, Dr Harkness?
     </em>
     Rio thought, a faint curiosity tugging at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     A small smile played at the corner of Rio's lips as she leaned back in her chair, trying to steady her racing thoughts. It wasn’t just the research. It was the woman herself, the mystery she presented, the way she seemed to be always in control, but - at least for a moment - had let it slip this morning. That small break in her otherwise flawless, harsh exterior was enough to make Rio curious of what else lay under her harsh facade
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t realise at first that Agatha had noticed her staring, but when their eyes met, it was impossible to miss the brief pause in Agatha's presentation. Agatha's gaze flicked to her, sharp and calculating, but there was a subtle smirk playing at the corner of her lips. Rio felt the tension in the air shift, the moment thick with a challenge, but she didn’t look away.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Miss Vidal," Dr. Harkness's voice broke through the quiet, smooth and teasing. "I just instructed you all to turn your attention to the graphs on the slide. Do you have a problem with doing so?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It was playful, but there was an edge to it, the kind of edge Rio had come to expect from Agatha. The room seemed to hold its breath, and for a split second, Rio wondered if she should just look down at her lap, act like she’d been paying attention. But then again, where was the fun in that?
    </p>
    <p>
     "No problem at all, Dr. Harkness," Rio said, her voice light and smooth, matching the playful tone Agatha had set, an innocent smile crawling across her face. "Just thought the way you present was..
     <em>
      fascinating
     </em>
     ."
    </p>
    <p>
     Her words hung in the air for a moment, and Rio could feel the other students shifting slightly. But Agatha didn’t flinch. Instead, she gave a small, satisfied nod and returned her attention to the slide.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, I expect you all to find the research just as fascinating. Now, as I was saying—"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned back in her seat as Dr Harkness continued, a faint smile playing at her lips, though her thoughts were already elsewhere. Dr Harkness had
     <em>
      definitely
     </em>
     noticed her. And for a split second, Rio wondered just how much of that was intentional.

    <p>
     It was only a few days into the term, and Agatha had already settled into her routine: balancing her own research with overseeing her new batch of PhD students.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were an uneven group, Billy was bubbly and kind, Alice was focused and efficient, and Jen… Well, she was an obvious suck-up. Agatha could already see that Jen didn’t have the depth of knowledge she pretended to. She was a classic “fake it till you make it” type, but that wouldn’t work here. Agatha had no tolerance for shallow displays of competence; Jen would need to truly learn this if she wanted to succeed in Agatha’s lab.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then there was Rio Vidal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had an energy Agatha hadn’t seen in a student in years. She was bold, with a sharp tongue and a confidence that danced perilously close to arrogance. Agatha had been watching her work, noting the way Rio sifted through research papers with an intense, almost defiant focus, as if daring the material to disappoint her. And every so often, Rio would glance up, and they’d make eye contact across the lab. Rio never looked away, her gaze unwavering, as if daring Agatha to react, always accompanied by that smirk that seemed to say
     <em>
      I know exactly what you’re thinking,
     </em>
     causing Agatha to scoff inwardly in annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, as much as Rio’s attitude got under her skin, Agatha found herself watching her closely. There was an energy to Rio’s intellect, a quickness that suggested she was actually as bright as she believed herself to be. Agatha noticed the way Rio would pore over research papers, scanning pages with a brisk intensity, occasionally muttering to herself when something didn’t match her expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
     The past few days had been quiet in the lab. The students, for the most part, had gotten on with their work, each absorbed in their own areas of study. Agatha, though she didn’t expect much from them this early in the semester, had checked in periodically. She knew they’d still be in the stage of narrowing down their PhD topics, sorting through vast amounts of information, and trying to figure out where their own interests intersected with the broader field. She didn’t expect any of them to have a solid project idea ready for at least another week, maybe more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy had been working steadily through his readings, asking an occasional question when he hit a snag with the literature. He seemed like the type who would thrive with a clear set of instructions and a structured plan, though Agatha would have to watch him to see if he could come up with something original. Alice was quiet, efficient, never needing much guidance, but Agatha suspected she was playing it safe, keeping her ideas close to her chest. She’d need a little more time before the real substance of her project emerged.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then there was Jen. Agatha had caught her once or twice pretending to be deep in thought, but her questions were always superficial—how to organise a literature review, when the next lab meeting was, what kind of formatting they should use for a grant proposal. Nothing that gave Agatha any confidence in her actual research capabilities. Jen seemed to think if she kept asking questions, she could fool Agatha into thinking she was on the right track. Agatha wasn’t fooled. The real work hadn’t begun yet for Jen, but it would have to eventually.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the most part, the students had left her to her own research. Agatha was grateful for the silence, the uninterrupted hours she could spend digging into her own projects. She had retired to her office and was deep into a paper about the intersection of aging and trauma when Rio approached her desk. Agatha didn’t look up at first, content to let the tension build a little longer
    </p>
    <p>
     “Need something, Miss Vidal?” she asked, head still pointed down at the paper she was reading , her voice cool, though her curiosity was piqued.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio folded her arms, regarding Agatha with a calculating expression. “I have some questions,” she said. “About my project.” Her tone was measured but still held that hint of audacity. Agatha waited, finally glancing up at her, curious but careful not to show it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, gesturing to the chair in front of her desk, ‘Be my guest.’ She said dryly, although she was eager to hear what Rio had been thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cleared her throat, taking a seat as she continued. “I’ve been going through your past publications, specifically your work on the hippocampus,” she began, holding Agatha’s gaze. “And I’ve been thinking, you found hippocampus degeneration in both epilepsy and Alzheimer’s. But in your study they seemed to target different areas. Alzheimer’s mostly the lower regions of the hippocampus: CA2, CA3, and CA4. Whereas epilepsy causes degeneration all over.’
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilted her head slightly, her tone clipped. “Yes, I do in fact know what my own research concluded, Miss Vidal. What is your point?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned forward, her voice steady and laced with a subtle satisfaction. “Well, Dr Harkness.” she said, pausing just long enough for her smirk to deepen, “I was looking through some microscope slides from the brain bank, and there are cases where patients with Alzheimer’s showed degeneration all over their hippocampus, not just the lower areas. And there was only one thing those patients had in common: seizures.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt a flicker of disbelief and irritation ripple through her. So that’s what Rio had been after, combing through the slides with such scrutiny. She had found something that directly challenged the neat boundaries Agatha’s research had set. She couldn’t help but feel a sting of offense, and yet… a glimmer of respect, too. There was a sharpness to Rio’s gaze, an assuredness that Agatha couldn’t ignore. She wasn’t just here to follow in anyone’s footsteps; she was carving out her own line of questioning, regardless of whose toes she might step on along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sat back slightly, her irritation tempered by interest. It was a significant observation, and one that very few students would have thought to pursue. “Interesting,” she allowed, watching Rio’s reaction closely. “So you think there could be a link between Alzheimer’s and Epilepsy? You could be onto something, but that’s an enormous topic for a first research project.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes lit up, her voice steady and assured, but with a glint of boldness “That was what I came to ask you about… What would you say about tackling it together? A co-authored study?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s brow lifted in surprise. Bold move, she thought, sizing Rio up. She leaned forward in her chair. “It’s intriguing certainly. I’m listening. But do you even know where we’d start with something like that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned forward as well, almost mirroring Agatha’s movements. “I want to study the relationship between the progression of both diseases. The possibility that one could exacerbate or even trigger the other. I believe we could find a connection in the subregions of the hippocampus. It could reveal why some epilepsy patients show degeneration in patterns similar to those with Alzheimer’s
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha held her gaze, resisting the urge to smile. Rio was annoyingly self-assured, but she had a point. This wasn’t idle speculation; it was a genuinely intriguing line of inquiry. But she’d be damned if she’d let Rio see her approval. “You think you can make the link?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s expression sharpened, and she leaned forward. “Yes. I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha regarded her for a long moment, the silence thick with unspoken thoughts. Finally, she gave a faint, almost reluctant nod. “Well, if my own research is going to be turned upside down, I suppose I might as well be part of the process,” she said, her tone dry but edged with interest. “I’ll help you tackle this, Vidal. But understand it won’t be easy. I don’t do things halfway.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A glint of triumph lit Rio’s eyes and she leaned a little closer, a knowing smile playing at her lips, as if she’d been waiting for Agatha to take the bait. “I wouldn’t expect anything less from you Dr Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The casual boldness in her tone sent a slight jolt through Agatha, and she shifted in her chair, steeling herself against the tinge of intrigue that had begun to feel far too personal. She narrowed her eyes, keeping her voice cool. “Good. Because if you’re serious about this, you’ll need to match my rigour, my discipline. We’re talking about research that could turn more than a few heads. You think you’re ready for that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s gaze lingered on her, unflinching. “Absolutely. I’m ready.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A silence stretched between them, charged and far too intense. Agatha cleared her throat, breaking eye contact, and nodded curtly. “Then we start immediately. Be prepared to re-examine every assumption you’ve ever made, every study you’ve ever read. You’ll need to convince me, and the field, that you’re onto something here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk only widened, and she held Agatha’s gaze for a beat longer than was necessary. “Oh, I will.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The look was uncomfortably lingering, and Agatha felt her skin prickle with an awareness she refused to acknowledge. She broke the moment with a brisk, dismissive flick of her hand, forcing her tone into something closer to brusque indifference. “Good. Now get back to work, and be ready to update me first thing tomorrow. No excuses.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow, amusement glimmering in her eyes. “Understood, see you tomorrow.” She turned on her heel, casting a final, unreadable glance over her shoulder as she strode out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Agatha watched her go, she exhaled slowly, feeling the pulse of something unsettling lingering in the air. A sharp, electric awareness that she couldn’t quite shake.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was more than Rio’s intellect that had caught her attention; there was a quiet intensity in the way Rio held herself, a confidence that pulled at Agatha’s composure in ways she was unwilling to admit. The way her dark hair fell just slightly out of place, as if to emphasise the casual defiance in her demeanour. Her eyes, sharp and calculating, never once breaking away when they’d locked onto Agatha’s; instead, they held steady, as though challenging Agatha to react, daring her to say or do something. Her smile, that smirk, that was always there, like a quiet, knowing invitation to something more. The way her lips curved with the slightest hint of mischief, her eyes never fully revealing what was behind them. It was a look that unsettled Agatha more than she cared to admit.
    </p>
    <p>
     She forced herself to look back at her own research, tightening her jaw. This was just another project, another student, another question to answer. She wouldn’t allow herself to get distracted. Yet, despite her best efforts, the faint thrill of Rio’s words, her defiant spark, left a trace that lingered far longer than she wanted to admit.

     Agatha arrived at the lab earlier than usual, the soft hum of the fluorescent lights barely audible in the sterile, near-empty space. Her heels clicked sharply against the linoleum floor as she walked past the rows of equipment, her mind already flicking through a mental checklist of things to address. But then she froze.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the far end of the lab, next to the microscope, was Rio. The sight caught her off guard. Rio was seated in her usual spinny chair, looking unusually relaxed, one leg up on the chair as she tucked her knee to her chest, leaning her arm over the knee.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes narrowed, scanning the scene without moving any closer. Rio’s tan trousers and loose white T-shirt were more casual than Agatha was used to seeing, though the black sweater vest, loose around her shoulders, was a familiar touch of the sharp confidence Agatha had come to both admire and detest. Her hair sprawled around her shoulders and the edges shone slightly brown as they were illuminated in the soft morning glow.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there was something about the way Rio held herself. Poised, intent, at ease in the space. It was hard to ignore. Agatha forced herself to look away.
     <em>
      Focus. No time for distractions.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha made her way towards Rio, she was close now, almost at Rio’s side, but the younger woman hadn’t noticed her yet, still absorbed in the microscope slide in her hands as she brought the piece of glass to her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watched, bemused, as Rio exhaled softly over the surface, fogging it briefly before reaching up with a sleeve to wipe it down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her movements were oddly graceful, as if she had all the time in the world, yet there was a sense of purpose behind every flick of her wrist. Rio held the slide up to the light, the soft glow illuminating the sharpness of her features. She ran a slender finger down its length, inspecting it with furrowed brows before squinting slightly, trying to see something just out of reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s gaze lingered a moment too long. The way Rio’s fingers traced the glass with such care and precision, all of it was disarmingly captivating for some reason. The angle of Rio’s neck, the tilt of her head as she squinted at the slide, the almost meditative quality of her movements... Agatha snapped her focus back to the task at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned in, closer still, until her mouth was just next to Rio’s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What are we looking at?" Agatha chimed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of Rio's soft inhale was the only response at first, then, when Rio turned her head with a flash of surprise in her eyes, Agatha added, "You know, just a pro tip, when you’re looking at a microscope slide, using a microscope usually helps."
    </p>
    <p>
     The smirk that crept onto Rio’s lips was instant, as if the sarcastic quip had already been expected. "Very funny," Rio muttered. "But I’m not looking at the cells. I’m looking at where the slide cuts off."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite herself. She leaned closer, squinting at the slide now visible in the light. The swirling structure was unmistakable, it was the hippocampus. Her favourite part of the brain. That delicate, spiralling shape, so tiny yet responsible for such a monumental task: the coordination of memory. Not just personal memories but meanings of words, facts, motor skills, every mundane detail of daily life depends on this small region.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watched as Rio’s finger traced the edge of the slide, pointing at the far right. "See here? The slide cuts off before the end of CA1 at the very edge. I can’t see the whole hippocampus."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's eyes followed the path Rio's finger traced for a moment, mesmerised. It took her a moment to process what Rio had actually said. Clearing her throat in attempt to regain any kind of clarity in her mind.
     <em>
      Focus, Agatha.
     </em>
     This was important work, not time for distractions.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That’s a good catch," Agatha admitted, her voice steady, though she could feel the rush of warmth creeping under her collar.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced up at her, catching her expression and offering a faint but knowing smirk. "I wonder if it would be possible to cut new slides."
    </p>
    <p>
     The suggestion caught Agatha off guard. It was rare for PhD students to need new slides, especially not with all the prepared samples in the lab. Most researchers just worked with what they had. Agatha opened her mouth, ready to tell Rio the logistical nightmare that would entail: tracking down case numbers for the right donated brains, checking availability, all the usual hoops.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Agatha could open her mouth to suggest it, Rio said, "I’ve got all the case numbers for the patients we need."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze.
     <em>
      She’s already ahead of me.
     </em>
     The thought irritated her, but she refused to let it show. She was the one in charge here. Her stomach twisted with a mix of irritation and reluctant admiration. She was losing her edge.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there was still more to discuss. They’d also need to check whether there was enough hippocampus tissue left in those donated brains, right? It was a critical detail.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, with that same knowing look, added, "And I checked the ‘room of doom’ this morning. All the fixed samples have enough hippocampus tissue for us to take, except one. But that one has a frozen hippocampus that I figured we could embed and use instead."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt a pang of frustration. She barely had the chance to speak, and Rio had anticipated every concern, already solving problems Agatha hadn’t even voiced yet. The girl’s efficiency was infuriating. But there was no denying it: Rio Vidal was proving herself a formidable force in the lab.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a brief moment, Agatha stood there, stunned into silence. Then, almost against her will, she let out a sharp laugh, the edge of it coloured with respect.
    </p>
    <p>
     She crossed her arms, trying to regain some semblance of authority. "Well, I suppose you’ve thought of everything, haven’t you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk widened, her eyes glinting as they met Agatha's, not a trace of hesitation in them. "I try," she said smoothly, then added, "It’s not often I get the chance to surprise
     <em>
      the Wicked Witch
     </em>
     after all."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, leaning in just slightly, her tone playful but edged. "Careful. Not everyone who surprises me lives to tell the tale.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t miss a beat, her smile deepening, almost daring her. She snickered, unfazed. "So I’ve heard. But I don’t scare that easily." She leaned back in her chair, her posture almost as much of a challenge as her words, arms folded in a mirror of Agatha’s stance. "Besides, I think you’re secretly enjoying the challenge."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, though she couldn’t shake the thrill curling low in her stomach. Rio’s words were almost too direct, too bold, yet there was an undercurrent, a glimmer in her eye that Agatha couldn’t ignore. "Don’t flatter yourself," she replied, levelling a cool gaze at her. But her tone softened despite herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, I don’t have to.” Rio shot back with a grin, her voice dropping just enough that it sent an unwelcome warmth creeping up Agatha’s neck. “You seem to do that plenty for me,"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha caught her breath but held her ground, leaning forward just enough to tower over Rio where she sat in her chair. "You’re not here to play games, Rio. This is serious work," she said, the formality in her tone undercut slightly by the glimmer in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head to the side, her gaze unwavering "I know. But who says serious work can’t have a little… intrigue?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The words hung in the air between them, taut and unyielding. Agatha opened her mouth, about to retort, but the words faltered as Rio’s lips curled into that subtle, almost conspiratorial smile that seemed reserved just for her. Agatha was at a loss for words. An unusual, rare state that only seemed to happen around Rio. For a brief, tense moment, they simply looked at each other, an unspoken challenge hanging between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fine," Agatha said at last, straightening up and nodding toward the microscope. "If you’re so determined to impress, you can start by actually looking at that slide
     <em>
      under
     </em>
     the microscope instead of just waving it around, then make notes of exactly what we need from the new slides so we get them right this time. I expect no detail to be spared,"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled, leaning forward to adjust the microscope with an exaggerated flourish. "Your wish is my command, Dr Harkness." she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head, managing to turn away just as she felt her own mouth begin to tug into a smile. But as she began the walk to her office, the lingering warmth of Rio’s gaze stayed with her, seeping beneath her skin, leaving her thoughts tangled in a way that, perhaps, she couldn’t afford to unravel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha strode back to her office, each step brisk, purposeful, as if she could walk off the thoughts that Rio had stirred up. Settling at her desk, she took a deep breath and opened her notebook, flipping to her most recent research notes. But as she tried to focus on her work, she found herself staring through the pages rather than at them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind wandered back to yesterday. Agatha’s grip tightened around her pen, her eyes narrowing as she recalled that moment. The nerve Rio had to so confidently point out a flaw in
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     work, one Agatha herself had overlooked. It had been only days into Rio’s PhD, and she’d somehow spotted an inconsistency that had slipped right past Agatha’s meticulous attention to detail. Agatha was no stranger to constructive criticism, especially from colleagues of her standing, but from a first-year PhD student?
    </p>
    <p>
     The audacity was infuriating.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it wasn’t just the audacity. It was the infuriating fact that Rio had been right. Agatha could still remember the slight smugness in Rio’s gaze when she’d brought it up, a smirk as though she already knew she’d caught something significant. Agatha’s pride smarted at the memory, and she found herself tapping the pen harder against her desk.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now, this morning, Rio had done it again, catching an error in the lab’s slides that, admittedly, Agatha hadn’t noticed. It was supposed to be a routine, ordinary task, yet Rio had observed, within minutes, that the hippocampus slide was incomplete. CA1 severed at the edge. The precise attentiveness, the way Rio’s eyes had narrowed, picking apart the oversight… Agatha’s jaw clenched, a slight heat of irritation flaring beneath her collar.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      She’s good. Too good.
     </em>
     Agatha mused, tapping her pen absently against the page.
    </p>
    <p>
     The image of Rio inspecting that slide surfaced in her mind again, unwelcome but vivid. Her breath hitched as she remembered the way Rio’s fingers had delicately traced the glass, her profile highlighted in the soft light from the window. The messy strands of hair loosely tucked behind her ears. She looked.. Graceful. Beautiful even.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked, briefly taken aback as she realised her thoughts had drifted further than she intended. Where did that even come from?
     <em>
      No, she told herself firmly.
     </em>
     This is unprofessional.
     <em>
      She’s your student. You’re here to guide her, not…
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Clenching her jaw. Agatha shut her notebook with more force than necessary, as if that act alone could dispel the image from her mind. She forced herself to redirect her focus to the day’s work, her mind set on research tasks that required all of her concentration. She would not indulge these thoughts any longer. Whatever fascination Rio inspired was something she needed to leave buried beneath the layers of professionalism. This wasn’t the time, and Rio Vidal was most certainly not the person, for such distractions.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Keep your distance,
     </em>
     she reminded herself, her eyes hardening with resolve as she reopened her notebook.

    <p>
     Agatha settled into her office. She flung her bag onto the leather chair beside her desk and sighed. The early light cast soft shadows across her office, and a rare quiet settled over the department. She’d arrived before anyone else today, hoping the silence would grant her some semblance of clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
     She let out a slow, measured breath and dropped onto her desk chair. Normally, the sight of her meticulously organised office, a refuge of books, data sheets, and the sharp scent of lab chemicals, was enough to calm her mind. Today, however, not even the stark, clinical silence could anchor her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her jaw clenched as she flipped open her laptop, pulling up a file she’d barely managed to read the night before. She needed to focus on her paper, the one she'd been chipping away at for months. It was foundational, the kind of study that could shift paradigms in neuroscience. If she could just focus long enough to get it done.
    </p>
    <p>
     But her mind refused to cooperate, drawing her back to the look in Rio’s eyes yesterday. That glint of amusement. The slow, deliberate way her fingers moved over the microscope slides, like she was handling something precious, something alive. Agatha’s cheeks flamed, and she forced herself to look at the sterile rows of data on her screen, hoping the familiar coldness would seep into her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a breath, then another, forcing herself to focus on the paper draft in front of her.
     <em>
      The influence of early-life depression on risk of developing Alzheimer’s
     </em>
     <em>
      Disease
     </em>
     stared back at her in bold font, but instead of data points and neural pathways, her mind drifted to Rio’s exasperating smirk, the way her fingers had moved gracefully over the microscope slides yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      What on earth are you doing to me, Vidal?
     </em>
     She thought to herself, leaning back in her chair with a frustrated sigh. She couldn’t understand how someone so young, so newly transferred, managed to occupy her thoughts like this. But It wasn’t just Rio’s confidence that set her off. It was her unshakable, almost mocking ease around Agatha, her willingness to challenge and even provoke. Most students would cower under Agatha’s notorious gaze. Rio, however, acted as if she and Agatha were in some twisted intellectual dance. Worse, it felt like Agatha was starting to play along.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clenched her jaw, hating how her thoughts spiralled each time she considered that smirk or remembered how close Rio had leaned over the lab bench. The previous morning had been particularly exasperating. Agatha had caught herself watching the way Rio’s fingers had trailed along the edge of the glass slide, lingering over her movements rather than actually listening to what Rio was pointing out. Every attempt to focus had dissolved into distraction
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      ‘Snap out of it, Harkness.’
     </em>
     she hissed into her empty office, shaking her head. This wasn’t her. Dr Agatha Harkness did not get distracted by PhD students. Especially not by cocky transfers who thought they could waltz into her lab and act like they belonged there. She didn’t allow distractions. She was controlled, professional, methodical. Traits she’d perfected over years in academia. She’d be damned if she let this girl break down every wall she had put up since the start of her career.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, she’d tried to keep her distance, keeping Rio occupied with assignments that required minimal supervision. She had notes to make on the requests for new slides, something tedious and time-consuming that wouldn’t require Agatha to linger nearby.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn’t bring herself to set foot in the lab. She told herself it was to focus on her own paper and give Rio the chance to get those notes done. But in reality, she knew she was avoiding Rio. Avoiding the way Rio looked at her, the way her questions cut past pretence and got right to the core. Avoiding that hint of something she couldn’t explain, something that went beyond the typical annoyance she felt with students.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the hours passed, Agatha stayed resolutely behind her office door, buried in drafts and emails. She convinced herself it was for the best, that keeping her distance would help her refocus, help her reclaim control over her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     But each time she tried to focus on the work in front of her, her eyes glazed over and her mind circled back to Rio. She pictured her again. Her casual stance, her sharp eyes that seemed to read Agatha’s every move, her irritatingly calm confidence. Agatha gritted her teeth, the pen in her hand hovering idly over the paper as she found herself, once again, stuck in this loop.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      This is insane,
     </em>
     Agatha thought, her teeth clenched. She’d been in this field far too long to be rattled by a student, no matter how infuriating. Yet, deep down, she sensed there was more to this feeling than mere irritation. There was a tension she didn’t want to acknowledge, something electric about their exchanges that she just couldn’t shake.
    </p>
    <p>
     Time dragged on, the hours slipping by with glacial slowness. Eventually, the sun dipped lower, shadows stretching across her office. She’d spent the entire day in here, hiding from her own lab, just to avoid the distraction Rio seemed to be creating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wasn’t stupid. She knew she couldn’t keep this up forever. Shutting herself away wasn’t a permanent solution to this growing problem. But for now, this distance was the only thing she could think of. A temporary barrier, just enough to clear her mind, to keep from succumbing to whatever strange pull Rio Vidal had over her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a slow, steadying breath, forcing herself to concentrate.
     <em>
      This is not like you. You’re better than this,
     </em>
     she told herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     By evening, the usual hum of productivity in the building had faded, the muffled sounds of students and faculty dwindling as they filed out. Agatha knew this was her chance to go down to the lab unnoticed. She needed to check on the work before the night ended, to review what Rio had managed to finish in her absence.
    </p>
    <p>
     She glanced at the clock.
     <em>
      19:58.
     </em>
     By now, she figured Rio must have left for the day. It was long after sundown, she would have gone home hours ago. Agatha could slip in, glance over the notes, and regain her footing without risking another unpredictable encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a sigh that felt closer to resignation than relief, Agatha pushed back her chair and made her way down the sterile hallway, her heels echoing in the emptiness.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lights were dim, casting long shadows against the walls as she entered the lab. To her surprise, a figure was hunched over the lab bench, completely absorbed in a notebook, scribbling quick, precise notes. Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze, instinctively stepping back into the shadows, watching as Rio absentmindedly tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, her gaze fixed intently on the data. She moved with a surprising ease, focused, unaware of Agatha’s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, Agatha thought of leaving before Rio could notice her, but something held her in place. She took a breath, squared her shoulders, and cleared her throat - a soft sound, but one that broke the quiet and drew Rio’s attention
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up, and a glimmer of surprise crossed her face, quickly replaced by her usual smirk. She glanced down at her watch, “Dr Harkness. Burning the midnight oil, are we?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha straightened, masking her surprise with a practiced coolness. “I could say the same about you,” she replied, her tone carefully neutral. “I assumed you’d have left by now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged, glancing back down at the notebook. “I’m almost done with the notes for the new slides, so I thought I might as well just finish them tonight. I didn’t expect you to be checking in though. I was beginning to think you’d left me to the wolves.” Her gaze drifted up, eyes narrowing slightly in that way that made Agatha feel as though she were the one under the microscope. “Avoiding the lab today, Dr Harkness?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The challenge in her voice sent a thrill through Agatha, despite herself.
     <em>
      Get it together,
     </em>
     she scolded inwardly, her expression neutral.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bristled, pushing down the strange sensation that accompanied Rio’s casual challenge. “I have other work to attend to, Vidal. I can’t spend all my time micromanaging my students.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hummed in response. A small sound which, combined with that infuriating smirk, seemed to say she had read through Agatha’s bluff. “Of course.” her eyes held a glint of something curious, bordering on amused. “Well, you can relax. Everything’s on track. I’ve been making notes the old slides: where they cut off, and what we need to include for the new ones, as you requested.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stepped closer to the bench, pulling out the spinny chair next to Rio and sitting down. She leaned back as she glanced at the stack of notes and the orderly trays of slides lined up beside them. Everything was meticulous, even more so than she’d expected. It was clear Rio had put considerable time into this work, going beyond what Agatha had assigned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’ve done well,” Agatha said, her voice quiet but genuine, catching herself off-guard as the words slipped out. She rarely offered praise, and yet here it was, undeniable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “High praise from
     <em>
      The Wicked Witch
     </em>
     herself,” Rio said, her voice dropping, edged with something unspoken. “Careful, you might make me think I’m your favorite.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, attempting to keep her expression steady, though her pulse quickened at the teasing. She scoffed “I don’t have favourites, Rio,” she replied, a hint of steel in her voice. “But you’re… competent.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled, letting her gaze linger on Agatha’s face for a beat too long. “
     <em>
      Competent
     </em>
     ,” she repeated, savouring the word, her tone dripping with sarcasm. “Why do I feel like that’s the closest I’ll ever get to a compliment from you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shifted, feeling the intensity of Rio’s gaze like a physical pull. She looked out the window, anywhere but at Rio, taking in the streetlamp outside which shone into the lab, illuminating the otherwise dark room. “My opinion isn’t what matters here,” she said, keeping her tone crisp. “Your work does.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I don’t know.” Rio’s eyes flicked over Agatha’s face, tracing the lines of her mouth, the faint shadow of her jawline. “I think your opinion matters more than you’d like to admit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha forced herself to meet Rio’s gaze, determined not to let the younger woman rattle her. “You wont get far with trying to read me, Rio. I don’t care for attempts at flattery”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good thing I’m not trying to flatter you, then. Or to read you.” Rio murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. “Though if I
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     trying, I’d say that I think you have more opinions about me than you let on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s throat tightened, but she forced herself to keep her expression steady. “Is that so?” she replied with a curious tilt of her head, keeping her voice as steady as she could, though she could feel her pulse quickening.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very much so.” Rio’s gaze drifted down Agatha’s body for the briefest second, then back up, her eyes daring. “And I think you know it, too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s jaw clenched, though her pulse quickened under Rio’s steady stare. She let out another scoff, “As I said, what I think of you is irrelevant.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it?” Rio’s lips curved, but her eyes held a different intensity. “Because if I didn’t know better, Dr Harkness, I’d say you have a habit of watching me that goes beyond… academic interest.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s composure slipped for a fraction of a second, just long enough for Rio to notice. She narrowed her eyes, determined not to give Rio any ground. “You’re imagining things, Vidal. I just expect my students to meet a certain standard. Nothing more.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled softly, leaning forwards on her chair, her elbows resting on her knees. She was close enough that Agatha could catch the faint, warm scent of her perfume. “Right. And it’s just professional expectations that kept you away from the lab all day, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt her cheeks warm, a rare lapse that only seemed to fuel Rio’s amusement. Before she could respond, Rio tilted her head as she leaned back in her chair again, voice soft and challenging. “I think you enjoy the challenge. I think maybe… you like that I’m not afraid to push back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She should have shut this down, turned on her heel and left Rio with a clipped reminder about boundaries. But she couldn’t seem to move, couldn’t seem to break away from the way Rio’s gaze held her in place, daring her to admit something she wasn’t ready to confront.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, she levelled her voice, masking the slight tremor beneath it. “Careful, Rio. You’re toeing a dangerous line.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk softened, but her eyes gleamed with unmistakable intent. “Oh I think I’m exactly where I want to be.” She held Agatha’s gaze, unflinching. “The question, Dr Harkness, is… are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath caught, but she kept her face impassive, swallowing hard. She placed a hand down firmly on the lab bench between them and stood up. Her tone ice-cool as she replied, “Enjoy your evening, Vidal.” And with that, she turned on her heel and left, the sound of Rio’s soft chuckle following her down the hallway, lingering in her mind long after she’d left the lab behind.

     It had been a few days since that conversation, and Agatha had tried her very best to ignore it. She’d thrown herself into work, been extra attentive to Billy, Alice and Jen’s questions. Stacked her schedule with extra meetings, taken on every request from the department. Anything to keep her mind from straying back to those maddening words.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I’d say you have a habit of watching me that goes beyond academic interest."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     How dare Rio be that bold? And what the hell did she even mean by it? Agatha was infuriated. She felt like Rio had seen right through her, piercing her defences in a way that left her strangely exposed. Agatha still didn’t understand the mess of feelings Rio seemed to provoke, but somehow, Rio seemed to understand exactly what was going on, and that was intolerable. This girl was always one step ahead, and it only added fuel to Agatha’s smouldering irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lab was silent now, the students out for lunch, and Agatha was grateful to take advantage of the quiet. She focused on sorting the latest brain donation her lab had received, welcoming the methodical process. This kind of work was simple and direct, almost mindless after Agatha had spent so many years managing this lab. She could lose herself in the work, letting each meticulous cut and measure carry her away from tangled thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     She held the brain in her gloved hands, admiring the smooth, cold surface. She weighed it, logged the data, and carefully laid out her tools. Then, with a practiced hand, she made a clean cut down the centre, separating the hemispheres. She dropped one into the bucket of preservative - formalin - watching as it settled under the surface. The other half she laid on the tray before her, dividing it into sections. Each slice was delicate, precise. She labeled each piece in a plastic bag with its case number and the name of the brain area, then packed them carefully into a bag of dry ice to be stored in the freezer.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was engrossed that she missed the faint sound of footsteps behind her, a light click she would’ve noticed under any other circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Must be nice, working with someone who can’t talk back,” came Rio’s voice, breaking the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tensed, fingers tightening on the tray for just a second. She didn’t turn around, taking a deliberate breath instead. Of course Rio would show up. Because
     <em>
      God forbid
     </em>
     she had one moment of peace and quiet to gather her thoughts. No. This girl never missed an opportunity to dig her claws into her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I wish could say the same about certain students," Agatha replied coldly, pressing the lid of the dry ice box shut with an audible
     <em>
      snap
     </em>
     and turning to look at Rio, whose expression was calm, bemused, and annoyingly at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe thats fair,” Rio said with a small laugh, stepping closer as the smirk landed back on her face. “But you don’t seem to mind students with a little backbone.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha crossed her arms, fixing Rio with a glare. “It’s only tolerable in moderation,” she retorted, raising her eyebrow. “Excessive backtalk usually indicates a lack of respect.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Or,” Rio countered, with that maddening glint in her eyes, “it might mean someone respects you enough to be honest.” She leaned back against the counter, crossing her own arms in a mirror of Agatha’s stance. “But I get it. Not everyone is used to being looked in the eye.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt a prick of irritation, and something else, less familiar. She held Rio’s gaze, unwilling to let this girl get the upper hand yet again. “You assume I’d want honesty from someone who barely knows her own place.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head, clearly enjoying this. “I’d say I know exactly where my place is,” she said softly. “Maybe it’s you who’s unsure.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s stomach tightened. She felt her patience fraying, the typical shields that guarded her composure slipping. “I suggest you choose your words more carefully,” she said, her voice low.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio only held her gaze, unflinching. “I just think it’s interesting, that’s all,” she said, tilting her head ever so slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a scoff. “If you spent half as much time on your research as you do in this futile attempt to read me.. or whatever it is you’re trying to do here, you would have serious potential.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow. “I am very serious about my work. I thought you might’ve realised that by now, but maybe you’re just too busy watching me to see it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The nerve on this girl. Agatha felt heat flare in her cheeks, and she looked away, grabbing for her clipboard. “Let me make something very clear,” she said, her voice low. “I don’t watch you. I evaluate your work, just as I do for any other student. You’re not special.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smile softened, almost a whisper of amusement, but her eyes were sharper than ever. “I didn’t say I was special,” she replied. “But whatever it is you’re doing, watching me… it goes both ways, you know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt a shiver run down her spine, as if Rio’s words had peeled back something she hadn’t wanted to face. She forced herself to meet Rio’s gaze, steady and unwavering. “Why don’t you pay closer attention to your own work, rather than reading into my actions Vidal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled softly, and to Agatha’s annoyance, it wasn’t mocking or defiant; it was as if she’d heard something she’d been waiting for. “Believe me, I’m paying attention,” she said, her voice barely above a murmur. “But not just to the work.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A silence fell over them, thick and unyielding. Agatha couldn’t form a response, her mind snagged on Rio’s words, the steady weight of her gaze. She wanted to dismiss her, to put Rio back in her place with a snide remark or cutting reprimand, but the words didn’t come.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, after God knows how long, Agatha pulled her thoughts together enough to snap “Is there something you need, Rio?” her tone sharper than intended. “Or are you here just to bother me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s gaze fell to the tray in front of Agatha. “Is this a new brain donation?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gave a curt nod, letting her gaze drift momentarily to the formalin-soaked bucket. “Yes. A woman with advanced Alzheimer’s,” she replied, her voice steady. She thought for a second, an idea springing to her mind “We should actually cut some new slides from this one for our project.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes met Agatha’s with an uncharacteristically hopeful look. Her voice betraying a hint of excitement. “This is the kind of work I’ve always wanted to be part of.” she said, her voice brimming with sincerity. “I’ve finished with all the notes for the new slides… Do you think I could help with the dissection?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused, weighing her answer carefully. She rarely let students assist with this stage of the process. But something in Rio’s expression was resolute, hungry. Against her usual reservations, she found herself nodding. “All right. Start by opening that bucket,” she said, gesturing to the container of formalin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moved forward, snapping on a pair of gloves before gripping the lid of the bucket and twisting it off with a smooth, practiced motion. Agatha’s eyes drifted, despite herself, to the way the muscles in Rio’s forearm tensed under where she had rolled the sleeves of her lab coat up. The steady efficiency with which she handled the materials was unexpected, almost impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
     She forced her gaze back to the tray, refocusing on the task at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     They worked side by side in silence, at first with Rio taking the bits of brain Agatha sliced and placing them carefully in the corresponding bags. Agatha watched her out of the corner of her eye, noting the way Rio’s fingers moved deftly over the bags, marking each one with the case number and brain region.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a few minutes, Agatha risked another glance over as Rio scribbled a case number on one of the bags, looking utterly focused, almost gleeful. Her face lit with genuine interest buzzing just below her steady concentration. There was a bright energy about her that was hard to ignore.
    </p>
    <p>
     Against her own instincts, Agatha felt herself asking. “Would you like to make the next cut?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s head snapped up, her face registering shock, her usual smirk replaced by a delighted grin. “Really?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Agatha said, her tone softened slightly. “Go ahead.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s surprise melted into a small, eager smile as she took the scalpel. With a focused precision, she guided the blade down the tissue, making clean, careful cuts. Agatha watched her hands move, admiring the careful way Rio handled the instrument. Steady, exact.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then her gaze drifted upward, almost unconsciously, to Rio’s face. Her expression was one of pure, unfiltered passion, her eyes sparkling with concentration and fascination. There was something genuine there, a spark that softened Rio’s features, making her look younger, more vulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio finally set down the scalpel, her gaze lifted to meet Agatha’s. Agatha nodded approvingly, forcing herself to pull back to her usual professional tone. “Well done,” she said, feeling an unexpected warmth in her words. “You’ve got a good hand for this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smile was small but undeniably proud, and Agatha found herself momentarily lost in the warmth of it, so far from their usual back and forth teasing. A rare moment of sincerity and understanding that passed between them.

    <p>
     After boxing up the fresh brain samples for the freezer and returning the bucket to the shelves, Agatha sent Rio off to fill in some admin forms for the new donation.
    </p>
    <p>
     She returned to her office, ready to dive back into her own work.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few solid, productive hours passed, the kind of focus that only pure, uninterrupted quiet could bring. Agatha managed to make significant headway on her paper, her thoughts running sharp and clear, until her phone began buzzing insistently.
    </p>
    <p>
     The caller ID made her stomach drop:
     <em>
      Mother.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     If people thought Agatha was cold, ruthless, and unyielding, well, Evanora Harkness was a masterclass in those qualities, sharpened into a weapon. Agatha’s personal policy was to avoid her as much as possible, but that didn’t stop Evanora from reaching out every few months. The routine was always the same: a few clipped questions about Agatha’s life, a bit of forced interest, followed by an all-too-familiar descent into disappointment and disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re wasting your life, Agatha. Chasing science, in that godless place,” her mother had said this time, her voice brittle with frustration. “You’re nearing forty five. No husband, no children. Not a single person who’ll give a damn about you in the end. And all because you thought you were too good for the life I gave you. Too good to stay here, too good to be a proper wife. Do you even know what people back home say about you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     It was exhausting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s responses had been mechanical, worn down over years of the same conversation. But despite herself, the words crept under her skin, burrowing into those quiet, vulnerable places she preferred to pretend didn’t exist.
    </p>
    <p>
     The worst part was the moment of hesitation, the flicker of doubt that she could never quite shake. What if, on some level, her mother could be right? What if all her accomplishments meant nothing in the end?
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time she hung up, her jaw was clenched, and her hands shook just slightly. She reached into her bag, fishing out a pack of cigarettes she’d stashed at the very bottom, a leftover habit she’d mostly kicked years ago, but in moments like this, she didn’t even bother to fight the pull. Could you really blame her?
    </p>
    <p>
     She shoved the pack into her coat pocket and slipped on her coat. She made her way through the lab, moving purposefully through the building toward the side door that opened to an alley.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stepped out into the darkness, the sharp chill of the evening air greeting her immediately. She reached into her coat pocket, pulling out the pack of cigarettes she’d shoved in there earlier, her fingers brushing the edges of the crumpled foil. She was about to take one out when a voice came from behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wouldn’t have pegged you as a smoker, Dr Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s heart skipped a beat, and she froze for just a moment before turning around. There, standing just a few feet behind her, was Rio, her face illuminated by a nearby streetlamp. She was leaning casually against the wall, a cigarette dangling between her fingers, smoke curling up around her face in the cold air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, her lips curling into a subtle, disbelieving smile. “Why not?” she asked, her voice almost cool, despite the slight flicker of irritation that stirred within her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk widened, her gaze flicking down to the pack in Agatha’s hand, then back up to meet her eyes. “Well, you’re a world-famous medical researcher,” she said, her tone teasing. “I would’ve thought you’d have more respect for your body than that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, shaking her head “I could say the same to you,” she retorted, gesturing at the cigarette Rio was holding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grin didn’t falter. “Fair point,” she said with a casual shrug, the smoke lazily drifting around her as she took another drag.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two stood in silence for a moment, the air between them heavy and thick, their breath misting in the cold. The world around them seemed to hold its breath for just a second, as if time itself was suspended.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha finally broke the silence with a hollow laugh. “I’m not a smoker. Not anymore at least,” she admitted, the words almost slipping out before she could stop them. “But when my mother decides to call… I need something to take the edge off.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes softened, though her smirk remained as she nodded her head in response. She didn’t say anything, just watched Agatha as she pulled out a cigarette from the pack and placed it between her lips. She rummaged in her bag, muttering under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck,” she hissed, frustration creeping into her voice. She must’ve forgotten her lighter at home.
     <em>
      Typical
     </em>
     , she thought bitterly.
     <em>
      The one day I need it, and I forget my fucking lighter.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Absorbed in her annoyance, Agatha didn’t notice Rio moving closer, her footsteps soft on the cold ground. She only looked up as Rio was stood right in front of her. Their gazes locked, a smirk playing on Rio’s lips as she pulled a lighter from her pocket, flicking it open with a smooth, practiced motion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath caught in her throat, her pulse quickening as Rio stepped even closer, almost too close. Rio’s eyes never left hers as she brought the flame to Agatha’s mouth, the red sparks dancing in Agatha’s peripheral vision as the flame flickered. Agatha’s breath hitched in her chest, the air between them suddenly feeling unbearably charged, every second stretching on for what felt like an eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Agatha inhaled the smoke, the sharp, bitter taste starting to fill her lungs as Rio pulled the lighter away. She didn’t know what had possessed her to let Rio get so close, but she couldn’t seem to bring herself to care in the moment. All she could focus on was the weight of Rio’s gaze, the way she felt impossibly present in that shared space, as if every small movement between them held meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out the breath, the mist of smoke rising in the cold air, her chest tight and full in a way she couldn’t explain. The moment lingered, hanging between them, just as taut as the tension in the lab that seemed to follow them both everywhere. Rio remained close, still watching her, and for a heartbeat, neither of them moved.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thanks," Agatha muttered, her voice quieter than before. She quickly pulled the cigarette away from her lips, looking anywhere but at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched her for a moment as she stepped to the side, the quiet stretching on longer than it should have. Finally, she asked, her tone softer than usual, “Are you okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha flicked her gaze back to Rio, not expecting the question. It wasn’t like her to ask, especially in such a gentle manner. “Do you… want to talk about your mother?” Rio added, her voice just a touch hesitant.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took a long drag from the cigarette, exhaling slowly, her chest tightening. She shook her head, forcing a tight smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “No, it’s fine. I’m fine. She’s just the usual crazy religious insane woman. Hates me for not having children. Hates me for not liking men. Hates me for choosing a career over becoming a mindless housewife, for leaving home and moving to London.” She paused to scoff bitterly, her lips curling into a wry smile, fingers tightening around the cigarette. “Anyway, I’m over it by now. She does this every few months. Same old rant. It’s just…” she paused, taking another long drag “Exhausting.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t realize she’d said so much until the words were already out. She immediately regretted it, her usual control slipping, leaving her feeling exposed in front of Rio. She quickly tried to backtrack, her voice turning more guarded. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t be talking about this with you. It’s unprofessional.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t say anything at first, but her eyes softened, her gaze a little more understanding than before. After a moment, she took another drag from her own cigarette, then flicked the ash away, her expression thoughtful. “You know,” she said casually, but with a touch of something more serious beneath the words, “You’re allowed to have moments where it gets to you. Doesn’t matter how much you’ve moved on. Sometimes it just hurts, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was quiet for a moment, not quite meeting Rio’s gaze, but she could feel the weight of the words hanging in the air. She let the smoke curl from her lips, watching it drift up and disappear into the cold sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a few seconds, Rio spoke up again, “I get it. Family can be a mess. Honestly, your mom sounds like a fucking piece of work.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes flicked back to her, surprised by Rio’s response.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, she really is,” Agatha said, her voice quieter now, the edge of frustration slipping away. “She’s... relentless. But I guess it doesn’t matter anymore. I’ve stopped letting it get to me. Mostly.”
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a pause, and Agatha found herself looking at Rio, taking in the way her lips curled around the cigarette between her fingers. For a moment, it was like everything else faded away. She’d spent so much time keeping her guard up, but something about the ease in Rio’s presence made it feel like maybe, just maybe, it was okay to let that guard drop.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, if you ever need to talk, I’m here,” Rio said, the playful glint in her eyes returning. “I’ve got an endless supply of sarcastic commentary and terrible advice. I’m practically a professional at that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorted, the smallest laugh escaping her lips. “You don’t say.” She glanced at Rio, half-amused, half-surprised by the unexpected comfort in her words. “I’ll keep that in mind. Though I can’t imagine your advice would be very…
     <em>
      professional
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk widened. “I’m great at giving advice no one should ever actually follow. It's a talent.” She took another long drag from her cigarette, her eyes glinting with that familiar mischievousness. “But really, if you need a distraction, I’m all for some less... emotionally heavy topics. Like, you know, your impressive lack of respect for your own health.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, already distracted from the knot of emotions her mother had stirred up. “I told you, I’m not a smoker,” she said with a smirk. “This is just… a temporary lapse in judgment.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grin grew wider. “Ok sure, I believe you.” She paused for a second to look Agatha up and down, lowering her voice, “So, what other
     <em>
      temporary lapses in judgment
     </em>
     do you have, Dr. Harkness?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio’s eyes raked over her. She had to take a second to collect herself before rolling her eyes in mock annoyance. "Nothing concerning you," she replied dryly, flicking the cigarette to the ground and stomping it out beneath her heel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk grew somehow even wider. She hummed as her tongue ran along her teeth. “Uh-huh. Sure. But say it like you mean it this time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s laugh was easy, full of that youthful irreverence that Agatha had, for reasons she couldn’t entirely explain, come to enjoy. It was strange, the way Rio could make her feel like she was standing just a little outside her own rigid control. Like maybe it wasn’t so bad to let someone see past the walls she’d built so carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
     The cold air between them seemed a little less biting now, the tension from earlier easing with the exchange. Rio flicked her cigarette away, and for a moment, they both just stood there, letting the silence settle in a way that didn’t feel awkward but rather… peaceful. Agatha realised that, for the first time in a while, she wasn’t desperate to fill the space with words, or with some kind of control.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked over at her, as if noticing the same shift. "So," she began, voice low but not without its usual spark, "You ever regret it? Leaving home, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the question. She tilted her head, considering it. “Regret?” she repeated, her voice tinged with uncertainty. She hadn’t really allowed herself to think about it, not like that. Not in such a simple, pointed way. “I don’t know if regret is the word.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She paused, feeling an unexpected wave of exhaustion wash over her. She didn’t want to get into it again. Didn’t want to explore the moments of doubt that always seemed to sneak in when she thought about her family. But Rio wasn’t asking for some dramatic confession, it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was just… asking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think," Agatha continued after a long pause, "I think I just felt like I had to. I had to get out. I couldn’t keep pretending I was okay with the life they wanted for me." She glanced at Rio, as if gauging her reaction. “Does that make sense?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, her expression quiet for a second, and Agatha almost wondered if she was getting too personal. But then Rio spoke again, her voice low, almost thoughtful. “Yeah, it makes sense. I think... if I stayed where I grew up, I’d lose myself. Everyone expects you to be someone else. To fit into some box, you know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her, genuinely surprised by the honesty in Rio’s words. She hadn’t expected that kind of reflection, not from someone who always carried herself with so much confidence, almost like nothing ever rattled her. But maybe she was wrong about Rio. Maybe Rio understood more than she let on.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought settled on Agatha like a gentle weight, something unfamiliar but strangely welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Exactly.” Agatha admitted, her voice softer now. She could feel a shift within her, a brief opening she hadn’t realised she’d needed. “But it’s interesting, to hear it from you. I just always assumed people like you… you have it all figured out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s lips quirked in a half-smile, the usual playful edge to her expression returning. “Oh, I
     <em>
      definitely
     </em>
     don’t have it all figured out,” she said. “But I’ve learned the hard way that pretending to be what everyone else wants you to be doesn’t exactly bring happiness. Or peace. And if you can’t find that, what’s the point?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took in the words, feeling a flicker of something in her chest. A flicker of recognition. It felt strange, how easy it was to talk to Rio in that moment. She had always kept things so compartmentalised, so guarded. But Rio didn’t push, didn’t judge. She simply listened, offering her own kind of unspoken understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment hung there between them, but as it faded, Agatha felt herself retreating, slipping back into the familiar armour she wore when she wanted to distance herself from anything too personal, too messy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, I should probably get back to the lab," Agatha said, the words coming out a little more abruptly than she intended. "There’s still work to do, and I’m sure you have plenty of your own to finish."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk softened for a second, “Yeah, I guess,” she said, exhaling a final cloud of smoke. “But hey, I wouldn’t mind sticking around for a bit longer. You know, in case you need any more terrible advice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She gave a small nod, her expression neutral. “Maybe,” Agatha said, the word surprisingly soft as she met Rio’s eyes. “I’ll think about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow, a hint of surprise flickering across her face. “Wow. Thinking about it?” she teased, her voice light, though there was something warmer behind her usual playfulness. “You must be really on edge if you’re actually considering human interaction.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s lips quirked into a faint smile. "Don’t get used to it," she replied dryly, though the edges of her smile lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled, tossing the last of her cigarette to the ground and stubbing it out. “I’ll take that as a maybe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused, her hand resting on the door handle as she turned back toward Rio. There was a moment of hesitation. This was crazy, right? Her boundaries had completely blurred. Rio was supposed to be her student, their relationship was supposed to be strictly professional. She definitely should not be sharing details of her personal life, or taking advice from her. Still, Agatha found herself almost… considering it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She glanced back, feeling the weight of her own hesitation before the words slipped out. “Actually, do you still have that lighter out?” She tried for nonchalance. “I might need another before I can go back inside.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyebrows arched in surprise, and a slow smirk crept over her face. “Oh, and who’s ‘not a smoker’ now, huh?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha huffed lightly as she walked back out into the alley, a faint exhale that was more of a stall than an answer. She pulled another cigarette from the pack, her fingers only slightly less steady this time. She leaned against the brick wall behind her as she positioned it between her lips, noticing the way Rio’s gaze dipped down, catching on her mouth with just the briefest flicker. It was subtle, almost imperceptible, something she could have easily brushed off, but Agatha felt it like a spark.
    </p>
    <p>
     She really should have learned the first time. She should have just asked Rio to hand her the lighter and lit the damn thing herself. Because as soon as Rio leaned in close again, Agatha felt herself completely forget every rule, every boundary she had ever learned. She didn't need this, didn’t need the steady heat of Rio’s presence blurring every line of professionalism. But then Rio stepped forward, the lighter catching in her hand, and Agatha’s heart beat just a fraction faster.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, Agatha barely noticed the flame as it sparked between them; her focus was locked on Rio’s eyes, unwavering and steady as she held the lighter close. Agatha leaned forward, inhaling just a little too quickly as Rio kept her gaze trained on her, an intensity there that felt almost electric. Smoke filled her lungs and the warmth between them lingered as she leant her head back, letting it rest against the cold brick behind her. She closed her eyes, focusing on the rhythm of her breathing as she tilted her face up to the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     But even with her eyes shut, she could feel Rio watching her. It was unmistakable, that heat lingering on her skin, tracing the exposed curve of her neck. It took every ounce of her composure to keep her breath steady as she opened her eyes again. And sure enough, there was Rio, who hadn’t stepped back at all. Hadn’t moved an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha should feel trapped. She was backed against the wall, Rio barely an inch away from her. But instead all she could focus on was the tingling heat between them, both grounding and disorienting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her breath caught, a shiver running down her spine as she felt Rio’s hand shift, slipping the lighter back into her pocket. But her gaze stayed locked on Agatha’s mouth, lingering in a way that was undeniably close, undeniably unprofessional.
    </p>
    <p>
     “...Rio,” Agatha murmured, the word barely a breath as it left her lips, betraying her more than she’d meant it to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s gaze lifted, catching hers with that same steady, knowing look, a smirk hovering at the corner of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha.” she replied, her voice rich with something unspoken, something neither of them were quite naming yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked, momentarily thrown by the way her name sounded in Rio’s voice. Casual, intimate, as if the usual formality between them didn’t exist. It was bold, almost infuriating, that she had used her first name. But there was something else there, too, something Agatha couldn’t quite bring herself to resent. Instead, the sound of her name left a warm, unfamiliar weight in her chest, unsettling and strangely… endearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took one more half-step forward, her coat brushing against Agatha’s. Slowly, Rio’s hand lifted, reaching up as if it were the most natural thing in the world, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s cheek as she tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt herself leaning into the touch, just a fraction, her eyes fluttering shut for a second as she felt a warmth spreading through her that she knew she shouldn’t feel. She forced her eyes open just as Rio’s gaze flicked down to her mouth again, her eyes lingering as if drawn by some invisible pull.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s heart thundered as she felt the same pull, an ache she could feel in the pit of her stomach. But then, clarity struck, sharp and sudden. This was a mess waiting to happen. This was crazy. Reckless.
    </p>
    <p>
     She straightened, mustering enough control to pull herself back, her head nearly hitting the wall with how fast she withdrew. “I really do need to be getting back to the lab.” The words came out shaky, breathless. Nowhere near the composed dismissal she’d intended.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let out a quiet, almost indulgent laugh, her amusement soft but palpable as Agatha took a step to the side. “Fine, as you wish,” Rio murmured, stepping back as well, voice light but threaded with that same knowing warmth. “You’re welcome for the light. And the terrible advice.” She took a final drag from her cigarette, exhaling slowly, smoke curling in the air between them. “See you tomorrow, Dr. Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The way she emphasised the title made Agatha’s breath catch, something about the mocking glint in Rio’s eye reminding her just how close she’d let things get. She gave a short nod, barely trusting herself to say anything further, and turned toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hand shook as she turned the handle and slipped back inside, the cold already fading in the warmth of the lab, but the buzz in her chest lingering stubbornly.

    <p>
     The early morning air was cool and dense in Agatha’s apartment as she moved through her routine, each step intentionally slow, as if stretching out the motions would allow her to regain control over the thoughts slipping away from her. She walked over to the kitchen counter, grabbing her thermos and carefully pouring coffee from the pot. The sharp, bitter aroma filled the air, but it did little to clear her mind. Rio’s words from last night lingered there, blurring the line between memory and something Agatha refused to name.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "What other temporary lapses in judgment do you have, Dr. Harkness?"
     </em>
     Rio had asked, voice low, nearly touching her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could still feel the heat of Rio’s breath, close enough that if she’d leaned in even a fraction more, their lips would have met.
    </p>
    <p>
     The almost-kiss. A momentary, irrational impulse that had seized her without warning, leaving her breathless and unsteady. Agatha shook her head, forcing herself to focus, but the words the memory, only burrowed in deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a lapse in judgment. A temporary lapse in judgement. Exactly as Rio had said. She had been emotional and vulnerable in that moment and had seen support in Rio. Sure, maybe her thoughts had gotten a little muddled in the process, but all she had wanted was comfort. And that was all it was, she told herself firmly, pouring coffee into her thermos with sharp, precise movements.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t know what had come over her. Well, she
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     know, and it was only a reminder of why she needed to keep her distance, keep this professional, strictly about the science. Not that Rio would make it easy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her apartment was a sanctuary of clean lines and calm spaces, her own carefully crafted retreat. But even in the quiet of her flat, she couldn’t escape the moment that replayed in her mind. She had bought it years ago after her first major promotion, just months after she had left home and started her climb up the career ladder. At the time, it was a triumph that had felt hollow without her mother there to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
     A two-bedroom in Kensington, spacious by London standards, with high ceilings and sleek, clean lines. The floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room usually cast a golden glow over the plush rug and carefully curated bookshelves, a view that overlooked the bustling high street below. But in the early autumn morning, the windows stood in inky darkness, reflecting only the dim light of her bedside lamp and the quiet sophistication of the space she had so meticulously crafted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally ready, Agatha gathered her things and stepped out, locking the door behind her. She moved through the familiar streets, the early morning quiet only broken by the faint rumble of distant traffic. She descended into the Tube station, thoughts already cycling through her long list of tasks. Today, she had a full agenda: gather the students, get updates on their project ideas, prepare them for the next phase of their research. She wanted them to be sharp, even if she wasn’t directly involved in each project like she was for Rio’s. Today she also had a session with the students for her own research; she'd decided to skip her usual lecture and instead put them to work on some tasks she needed done. With Rio’s project picking up soon, it was going to take up a lot of her time. She didn’t want her own publication to suffer; she’d need to find some balance.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time she stepped off the tube, the city was waking up, the air brisk as she climbed the steps back into daylight. She cut through familiar streets, quickly entering the lab building.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha strode through the hall, her heels echoing in the early quiet. She pushed open the door to the common room, her gaze scanning for each of her students. Her gaze stopped on Rio first, whose eyes lifted the instant Agatha entered, her gaze meeting Agatha's with a boldness that left Agatha unexpectedly breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
     The memory of last night came rushing back. Rio’s brown eyes fixed on her lips, Rio's face close to hers. What almost happened in the smoky dark, what could have happened if she just had a little less self control. She felt an uncomfortable twist in her chest. Agatha quickly forced her gaze away, collecting herself with a quiet breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat with a casual poise, that infuriating smirk already in place. The slightest tilt of her brow as if she knew exactly what Agatha was thinking. She felt an uncomfortable twist in her chest. Agatha quickly forced her gaze away, collecting herself with a quiet breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     She addressed her students curtly, gesturing for them to begin with their project updates. “Billy, you’re up. Let’s hear it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy swallowed, looking briefly down at his notes before launching into his update. “Ok, um, for my project I’m studying Tau protein as a biomarker for Alzheimer’s,” he began, his voice wavering just slightly. “Tau tangles are a hallmark of the disease, but they’re usually only detected in postmortem tissue. I’m working on a protocol to track Tau in living patients, using spinal fluid samples.” He glanced at her for a sign of approval, but Agatha remained expressionless. “If we can establish a reliable marker for Tau in the early stages, we could identify Alzheimer’s risk much earlier and maybe even monitor how well therapies are working.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised a brow, waiting a beat before pouncing. “And what are the limitations of measuring Tau in spinal fluid? What other variables could interfere with your findings?” she asked, her tone sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha liked to grill her students on their presentations. Sure, anyone could preset a neat, prepared speech when it was all written in front of them. But their ability to adapt when they were pushed, that was what showed real knowledge. Real understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy shifted, searching for an answer. “Well, uh, other proteins in the fluid could create noise in the sample, making it difficult to isolate Tau specifically…” He trailed off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gave a slow nod. “And how do you plan to mitigate those effects?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy’s cheeks flushed, and he swallowed hard before managing, “I have plans to work on a filtering protocol that I think could help improve specificity.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Make sure you do,” she said coolly, moving on. “Alice, your turn.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice looked down briefly at her notes, gathering her thoughts, before speaking. “My research is on dopamine pathways in Parkinson’s disease.” She glanced up, her voice growing steadier. “There’s so much degeneration by the time symptoms appear that it’s difficult to understand which pathways might be driving early symptoms. I’m working on identifying subtle pathway changes that occur right before symptoms start. The goal is to isolate any indicators that might lead to earlier diagnosis, or even targeted therapies.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tapped her fingers thoughtfully on the table. “So, what makes you confident that these changes will show up before symptoms begin? What if what you’re seeing is just normal neural variation?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice stiffened, a flicker of doubt flashing across her face, but she managed a response. “I’ll compare data from early-stage Parkinson’s patients with control groups. Collect preliminary evidence to see any patterns. But you’re right; there’s a chance the variation may not be abnormal, so I’m considering alternative explanations as I go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good,” Agatha replied, her gaze softening just slightly. “Keep challenging your assumptions.” She turned to Jen. “Jen, you’re up. Let’s hear it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen took a breath, looking at Agatha directly, the quiet determination in her eyes catching Agatha’s attention. “My project focuses on the CAG repeat expansions in the HTT gene - the mutation responsible for Huntington’s disease,” she began, her voice calm. “The number of these repeats directly correlates with disease onset and severity, but there's still a lot to understand about the underlying mechanism.” She paused to glance at her notes, then continued, “I’m exploring how different lengths of CAG repeats impact early gene expression changes, especially in the brain regions affected first by the disease. By identifying these changes, I hope to clarify some mechanisms of disease progression and potentially uncover a few early markers for intervention.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned forward, pressing her fingers together. “What makes you think these gene expressions will be significant enough to act as markers? Isn’t it likely the effect is too subtle to detect?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s answer came without hesitation. “The changes are subtle, yes, but previous studies show that even small expression shifts can be amplified over time in these regions, eventually impacting entire pathways. I’ve been using sequencing techniques, which are showing some promising early trends.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was momentarily taken aback. She leaned back, arching a brow, testing her further. “And how do you plan to differentiate those early markers from secondary effects? Isn’t there a risk of confusing causation with correlation?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s eyes sparked with quiet confidence. “I’ve designed the study to track expression changes longitudinally, so I’ll be able to compare baseline levels with the changes that emerge over time. This should help isolate causative markers from downstream effects.” She looked at Agatha, unflinching, as if inviting her to challenge her further.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a second, Agatha felt a flicker of admiration. Jen was showing real promise, a keen attention to detail. Perhaps she’d misjudged her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, she turned toward Rio, who was watching her with that same unshakable intensity that made her breath hitch for a moment. She cleared her throat. “Rio, you’re next.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shifted in her seat, that familiar glint in her eye as she looked at Agatha, as if they were about to start a game only the two of them understood. She held Agatha’s gaze, unbothered, and began her presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My… or I guess
     <em>
      our
     </em>
     project is a cross-sectional study of epilepsy and Alzheimer’s pathology,” she said, pausing briefly to correct her language, but her voice was steady and deliberate.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ll be using stained brain tissue slides from Alzheimer’s patients, epilepsy patients, and—” she leaned forward slightly, her voice dropping a fraction “a subset of Alzheimer’s patients who had also experienced seizures. By analysing these specific groups, we aim to see if seizure activity accelerates the usual progression of Alzheimer’s.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha folded her arms, feigning boredom, though her mind was already evaluating Rio’s composure.
     <em>
      Confident as always,
     </em>
     Agatha thought, with a flicker of begrudging respect that annoyed her, as well as a churning in her stomach that lately had seemed to appear every time she was in Rio’s presence. “And what’s the control for seizure activity? How do you intend to separate correlation from causation?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked, meeting Agatha’s gaze directly, an unflinching spark in her eyes. “We’ll use standard staining methods on each slide to mark Tau proteins. By comparing slides from Alzheimer’s patients with and without a history of seizures, we can see whether additional Tau build-up is truly caused by seizure activity.” Her eyes gleamed as she continued, “Of course, if it’s causative, I’m sure you’ll let me take credit for that breakthrough, Dr. Harkness.” Rio chimed, with an overdramatic batting of her eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
     A faint, involuntary laugh escaped Agatha, though she quickly masked it with a critical look and an eye roll. “Don’t count on it, Vidal. Now, tell me, if the effect of seizures is our target, what exactly do you think tracking Tau deposits will add to the analysis?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s expression was unyielding, her tone brimming with mock innocence. “Well, Dr Harkness, as I’m sure any first-year neuroscience student could tell you, a deposit of Tau proteins in the hippocampus is the main physical marker of Alzheimer’s disease.” She kept her gaze locked with Agatha’s as she added, “So, we’ll see if there is increased Tau deposition in patients who’ve had seizures, to see if the seizure stress triggers the degeneration in Alzheimer’s.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s jaw tightened as she struggled to maintain her composure under Rio’s relentless focus, but a reluctant admiration was growing under her frustration.
     <em>
      She knows her shit,
     </em>
     Agatha admitted, annoyed at how effortlessly Rio was handling her questions. “And what about the sampling issues? The slides we’ll be using are all from different points in the disease progression, will that not effect the validity of our findings?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have a point.” Rio’s expression never wavered. “That’s why I’m proposing we categorise them by the stage their Alzheimer’s was when they died and analyse each subset individually. It’s ambitious, sure, but I assumed you’d appreciate that. The rigour.” Her smirk was challenging, as if daring Agatha to argue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised a brow, letting out a hum of begrudging agreement. “And how do you plan to control for damage to the brain cells from the preservation process? The staining alone could skew our data.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged, casual as ever, as if she’d anticipated every question. “Not if we’re careful. I’ll prepare fresh sections from the highest-quality samples and validate against controls before running our analysis. But I could always consult the
     <em>
      esteemed
     </em>
     Dr. Harkness for her expertise, if she’s interested.” Her tone was suggestive, with a glimmer that sent a rush of heat up Agatha’s spine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s chest tightened, though she hid her reaction with a sharp reply. “As I’ve said repeatedly, Vidal, flattery will get you nowhere.” It felt like she and Rio were the only ones in the room. “So, what’s your final hypothesis, then?” she asked, almost daring her to trip up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned in slightly, her gaze narrowing, as if this were a private challenge between them. “I hypothesise that the presence of seizure-induced stress accelerates the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Is that all fine with you, Dr. Harkness?” Her words were almost a whisper, slow and charged with something she knew would set Agatha on edge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha inhaled sharply, ignoring the tingling warmth that Rio’s gaze sparked.
     <em>
      She knows what she’s doing,
     </em>
     she thought, both irritated and impressed. She glanced around the room, finally aware of the other students, all wide-eyed and silent, trying to make sense of the tension that thickened the air. She cleared her throat, fixing her gaze on Rio with a detached, professional look that took much more effort to conjure than she cared to admit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very well, Vidal,” she said, voice tight, her pulse still quicker than it should have been. “Let’s hope you can back up that theory with results.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk deepened as Agatha finished, and for a moment, there was a charged silence in the room. Then Rio leaned back, her gaze never wavering. “Let’s hope
     <em>
      we
     </em>
     can back up the theory with results,” she said, a slight challenge in her voice. “Remember, Dr. Harkness, you’re just as involved in this as me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt her cheeks flush, heat prickling at her skin as she struggled to keep her expression neutral. The gall of this girl, reminding Agatha of her own stake in the project. Of how their work was now bound together inextricably. She cleared her throat, willing herself to stay composed, yet couldn’t help but feel a flicker of something unsettling and thrilling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t forget your place, Vidal,” she said curtly, but the words lacked the bite she intended. All she saw was Rio’s steady, amused gaze, as though daring her to admit that, in this, they were equals.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha straightened, fixing her gaze on the group as a whole. "Okay. I'm impressed with everyone’s project ideas; there’s some real potential here. You have up to two years to work on this research," she said, her tone brisk, professional. "I’ll be checking in regularly, and I want written updates each month. For the next few weeks, I recommend you start by drafting equipment lists, detailing what slides or samples you’ll need to study, and submit them to the lab admins who’ll get it sorted for you. You can go grab lunch now if you’d like, but I expect to see you back in the lab in half an hour for my session. You’ll all be assisting with my research."
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned to refill her thermos with coffee, a familiar ritual that gave her a moment to collect herself. She could hear them beginning to file out, shuffling footsteps moving toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      No,
     </em>
     Agatha thought with a sigh.
     <em>
      If there’s one thing I know about Rio Vidal, it’s that she loves to linger where she isn’t needed. Or wanted,
     </em>
     she added mentally, though she was having trouble convincing herself that last part was true. But why would she want Rio to stay? She’d already challenged her enough for the day. This was purely aggravating. Right?
    </p>
    <p>
     She poured the coffee with her back still turned, her voice coming out sharper than intended. “You’re still here, aren’t you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why did you ask me so many questions?” Rio’s voice came from just behind her, a low murmur that carried a hint of amusement. “You only asked the others one or two, yet the project you already know the most about… you suddenly had all the questions in the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, feigning indifference as she stirred sugar into her coffee. “My job to push you. To test your limits.” She glanced over her shoulder, hoping she looked unbothered. Rio met her gaze with a look of cool challenge, her expression unreadable, save for the slight curve of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head slightly, the hint of a smirk on her lips. “Some people might say it seems like favouritism, Dr. Harkness.” Rio paused, her tone feigning innocence, “Not me of course, but some people.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, suppressing the faint twist of irritation and something else, something she refused to name, as she turned back to her coffee. She felt a rush of heat creep into her cheeks, unbidden, and she kept her gaze firmly on her thermos as she screwed the lid back on. “Vidal, I think you should worry more about our research plan than about whatever nonsense you think is going on in my head.” She hoped the words sounded indifferent, but there was a tension in her voice that made her bite the inside of her cheek as her gaze flitted back up to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     She only raised her eyebrow even further, unperturbed. “’Vidal’. Wow, suddenly we’re so formal? Last night it was Rio’.” she said lightly, lingering in the doorway as if considering saying more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned back to her coffee, taking a steadying breath before screwing the lid onto her thermos. She was about to make some quick reply, something to deflect the tension when she noticed Rio hadn’t moved, hadn’t turned to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     A silence stretched between them, uncomfortable and taut, until Rio broke it with a question that froze her in place.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are we gonna talk about last night?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt her heart stutter in her chest, her pulse quickening despite herself. She opened her mouth to respond, but no words came, her throat suddenly dry. Seconds passed, thick with unspoken words, as she kept her back to Rio, clinging to the illusion of composure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Rio let out a soft chuckle, “Fine. I’ll see you after lunch then…” She paused, dropping her voice, “..Dr Harkness.” her tone teasing but there was a hint of something else as well. Something Agatha didn’t want to think about.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watched her leave, feeling the air settle uncomfortably in the quiet that followed. The exchange played over in her mind, Rio’s words replaying with that mocking tilt, and the way her own responses had been much less controlled than she’d wanted. She felt an unwelcome sense of intrigue beneath her irritation, and it lingered, unwanted, as she headed back to her office, her grip tightening around her thermos.

     The students were already gathered in the lab when Agatha arrived, their faces a mix of nervous anticipation and determination. Billy was flipping through his notes, Jen was fiddling with a pen, and Alice was adjusting the settings on one of the lab microscopes. Agatha set her bag down with a sense of purpose, surveying the room. She couldn’t help but notice, however, the distinct absence of Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her voice was sharp and cutting as she asked, “Has anyone seen Vidal?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The three exchanged uneasy glances. Billy was the first to speak, his voice small. “Uh… no. Not since before lunch.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a slow sigh, irritation bubbling.
     <em>
      Typical.
     </em>
     She pinched the bridge of her nose briefly before straightening, her tone brisk. “Fine. We’ll start without her.”

     She moved to the middle of the lab, her heels clicking with purpose on the tiled floor. As she turned to face her students, she clasped her hands together. “Today’s session is not just about your own individual projects.” She began, her voice firm and deliberate. “This is about assisting with
     <em>
      my
     </em>
     research, and the stakes are far higher.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The room was silent, the weight of her words hanging in the air. She took a step closer, her gaze sweeping across the trio. “Any mistakes you make today, any oversight, any lapse in judgment, will either compromise this groundbreaking research, or it will leave me cleaning up after you. And I assure you, I do not take kindly to either.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Just as the tension in the room reached its peak, the lab door creaked open. Agatha didn’t have to look to know who it was; the telltale languidness of Rio’s steps gave her away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nice of you to finally join us,” Agatha said coldly, her focus still on the others as she scribbled something in her notebook. She could feel Rio’s gaze, that unrelenting weight of her presence, but she refused to give her the satisfaction of reacting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Agatha turned, her expression carefully neutral as she addressed Rio directly. “I was just telling the others how important this work is. How assisting with my research means there are greater consequences than working on your own projects.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned casually against the doorframe, the corner of her mouth twitching up into a smirk. “Oh, of course,” she said, her voice dripping with mock sincerity. “I imagine everything has higher stakes when the infamous Dr. Agatha Harkness is involved.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, narrowing her eyes. “Well,” she said, her tone cool and cutting, “I was also about to say how vital it is that everyone is fully committed and serious about this research. Even more so than their own. But I suppose you’ve already shown me that you couldn’t care less. So, Vidal,” she continued, her gaze sharp, “If you’d rather not be here, I mean, you know where the door is.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The room went silent, all eyes shifting nervously between the two. Rio’s smirk deepened as she tilted her head as if deep in contemplation, her gaze steady and teasing. “Tempting,” she said, her voice low and playful. “But then who would keep you on your toes, Dr. Harkness?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s jaw tightened, a flush of heat rising to her cheeks despite her best efforts to remain composed. She lifted her chin, fixing Rio with a steely look. “If you’re staying, then I expect you to take this seriously.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pushed off the doorframe with a lazy shrug. “Of course, Dr. Harkness. You’ve made it
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     clear how high the stakes are.” Her voice was light, but her eyes gleamed with mischief as she started to move to join the others.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s fingers twitched at her sides, the tension simmering just below the surface as she forced herself to return to the task at hand. She ignored the flicker of Rio’s amused expression and turned back to the others. “Let’s begin,” she said sharply, her voice regaining its edge. “This is not a place for distractions.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow as she strode further into the room, her steps painstakingly slow and deliberate as Agatha spoke. Her path took her close to Agatha, far closer than necessary, and she paused just long enough as she passed to lean in close to Agatha, her voice a hushed murmur that only Agatha could hear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No distractions, hmm?” Rio said, her tone laced with playful defiance. “Well then, maybe I should just…” She gestured lazily toward the door, her lips curving into that maddening smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched, a sharp intake that betrayed her perfectly composed exterior for a fraction of a second.
     <em>
      The nerve.
     </em>
     Her thoughts raced, laced with a mix of fury and something she didn’t want to name. How on earth did this girl know the effect she was having? How dare she imply-
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha fixed Rio with a glare so sharp it could cut glass. “Will you just be quiet and let me get on with this, Vidal?” she hissed, her voice stern and brimming with authority. Her hand shot out, pointing to the lab bench where the others sat in confusion, pretending not to notice the tension crackling between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk widened into a grin, her delight almost childlike as she took in the fury simmering in Agatha’s eyes. With an exaggerated shrug, she muttered, “Whatever you say, Dr. Harkness,” before sauntering over to the bench. She flopped into a seat, her movements unhurried, and leaned back casually, her smirk so wide she was all but giggling to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could feel the heat rising to her cheeks, a combination of rage and a far more unwelcome feeling she ruthlessly tamped down. She straightened her spine and returned to the center of the room, doing her best to regain her composure. Behind her, she could hear Rio stifling a laugh, and it only made her irritation grow.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now,” Agatha said sharply, her tone carrying more edge than intended. “Let’s get started. I trust we’re all finally ready to focus now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Out of the corner of her eye, she caught Rio’s smug grin, and her hand tightened around the pen she was holding.
     <em>
      This is going to be a long afternoon.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cleared her throat, drawing everyone's attention back to her. “All right, listen closely because I’m only going to explain this once,” she began, her voice crisp and commanding. “Your task today is straightforward but vital to this study. We are sorting through autopsy reports of individuals whose brains I have been analysing as part of my research on depression and Alzheimer’s.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She gestured to a tall stack of neatly organised reports on the counter beside her. “First, you will go through these reports and note down whether each patient was on antidepressants prior to their death.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Once that’s done, you will take the case numbers, find the corresponding brain donation, which should be in one of the buckets in the ‘
     <em>
      room of doom’
     </em>
     over there” She pointed to the sliding door at the end of the lab.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Once you have the brain, you will place it on the scale over there.” She motioned toward the electronic scale on the opposite counter. “Record the weight. It’s a simple, systematic process. Have I made myself clear?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The students nodded in unison, eager to prove themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good. Then get started,” Agatha commanded, gesturing to the reports.
    </p>
    <p>
     The students scrambled toward the stack of papers like a flock of startled birds, all except Rio, who lagged behind with deliberate nonchalance. Halfway to the stack, she stopped, turning back to Agatha with that infuriatingly confident gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     “When you started talking about the tremendous stakes of today’s work, Dr. Harkness, I really thought we might be doing more than reading through patient notes and putting brains on scales,” Rio said, her tone laced with teasing sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s jaw tightened. She forced herself to exhale slowly before responding. “Vidal,” she said, her voice measured but firm, “You need to understand that there is
     <em>
      no
     </em>
     unimportant part of research. This work is just as crucial as any dissection. Now, if you’re done complaining, perhaps you’d like to join your peers in being productive.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t reply, just smirked and grabbed her share of the reports.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha returned to her station across the lab, where she busied herself sorting microscope slides. Every so often, she glanced up to check on the students’ progress. Her gaze, despite her best efforts, often landed on Rio, who was engrossed in the reports, her pen moving quickly across the page.
    </p>
    <p>
     One time, as Agatha looked up, she was startled to find Rio’s eyes already on her. The younger woman’s expression was uncharacteristically thoughtful. It wasn’t mocking, as Agatha might have expected, but rather curious, even admiring. Agatha raised an eyebrow, the gesture sharp and questioning, as if to say,
     <em>
      Look who’s staring now.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes widened in brief surprise before she quickly looked back down at her work. Agatha smirked to herself, though she quickly shook it off.
     <em>
      No distractions.
     </em>
     she reminded herself firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
     An hour passed in relative quiet, broken eventually by Billy’s voice from across the lab. Quiet but carrying a faint, incredulous tone. “Rio… how do you talk to Dr. Harkness like that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nearly laughed, but she kept her expression neutral, pretending to be preoccupied with the slides. Billy clearly thought she couldn’t hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah” Alice chimed in, her voice a hushed whisper but sounding a little in awe. “No judgment or anything, but I honestly feel like crying every time I talk to her. How are you so…confident?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt a smug satisfaction settle over her. Good. At least
     <em>
      some
     </em>
     of her students knew how to respect authority. She could hear Rio snickering quietly, evidently enjoying their fascination.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Jen piped up, her voice carrying a sharper edge. “Yeah, what
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     going on with that, anyway? And why are you so cocky about it? What, you think you’re better than us just because you’re in some… intellectual ping-pong game with Dr. Harkness?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha found herself rolling her eyes at no one in particular. Still listening from across the lab as Billy hissed a frantic “Shhh!” trying to shush Jen, but Rio only laughed louder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t need to look up to know Rio would be taking the comment in stride. But curiosity got the better of her, and she cast a sidelong glance toward the benches, just in time to catch Rio’s mischievous smirk aimed right back at her, lifting her chin slightly, her eyes glinting in the same mischievous way Agatha had come to recognise. It was so fleeting, but the look in Rio’s eyes felt conspiratorial. As if they were sharing some inside joke, an unspoken dare.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jen,” Rio said as she tuned back to Jen, the tease unmistakable in her voice, “if you’re so jealous of me, why don’t you just work a little harder and impress Dr. Harkness yourself instead of…whatever it is you’re trying to do, reading into the way I talk.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head, half-amused, half-irritated.
     <em>
      Unbelievable.
     </em>
     The nerve of this girl, almost directly quoting Agatha’s own words from earlier:
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Vidal, I think you should worry more about our research plan than about whatever nonsense you think is going on in my head”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     And that tone, like she didn’t care if Agatha noticed or not. Honestly, she couldn’t help but feel grudging admiration for Rio’s audacity. The girl had guts, Agatha would give her that much. But, she decided she’d had enough of the escalating chatter. With a sharp clap of her hands, she strode over to the center of the lab and drew everyone's attention back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right, everyone. That’s enough for today. Thank you for your help. Let’s all hope none of you managed to screw up my research, shall we?” Her eyes flicked pointedly to Rio, who simply smirked in response. Agatha ignored it, turning her attention back to the group. “See you all tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The students began to gather their things, shuffling toward the door. Agatha stepped back, watching them file out, her expression unreadable until Rio was the last one left, her deliberate pace slowing as she approached the exit. Just as Rio reached the threshold, Agatha stepped forward, blocking her path.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio halted, looking up with her usual air of intrigue and just enough insolence to needle Agatha’s patience. She raised an eyebrow, her lips quirking upward “Yes, Dr. Harkness? Is there perhaps… something you’d like to discuss before I leave?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stiffened.
     <em>
      Does she have to bring up last night with every look and every word?
     </em>
     She straightened her posture, folding her arms across her chest, refusing to be baited into whatever game the girl was trying to play.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, Vidal, there’s nothing to discuss,” she said, her tone clipped. “I simply wanted to let you know that I’ll need you in the lab early tomorrow. We’ll be starting on the new slides for the epilepsy project, and I don’t want to waste time waiting for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head, her smirk curling wider, a flicker of amusement dancing in her eyes. “Dr. Harkness,” she drawled “I’m always in early. Surely, you’ve noticed by now. So, what’s this really about? Did you just want an excuse to keep me behind?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes narrowed, her exasperation barely contained. She let out a low, sardonic laugh and rolled her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Vidal, for goodness’ sake.” She started, her tone exasperated, “I simply wanted to tell you that you need to meet me here at
     <em>
      8 a.m.
     </em>
     sharp. Stop imagining that everything I do somehow revolves around you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Without waiting for a reply, Agatha turned sharply on her heel, taking a step toward her desk, then hesitated. Looking back over her shoulder, she brought her hand to her mouth in a mock whisper. “It’s pathetic.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t wait to hear Rio’s response. She didn’t have to. The stunned look on Rio’s face as she stood frozen in the doorway was satisfaction enough. Agatha walked briskly out of the lab, her heels clicking decisively on the tiled floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Behind her, Rio blinked, incredulous, before breaking into an unexpected laugh. “Touché, Dr. Harkness,” she murmured to herself, shaking her head as she finally followed the others out.

    <p>
     The cold morning wrapped around Agatha like a warning. She stood just outside the lab’s glass doors, letting the biting cold settle her nerves. The sun hadn’t yet risen high enough to warm anything but the faintest edges of the horizon, leaving the campus paths dusted with frost. Her breath fogged in the air, dissipating as quickly as her resolve threatened to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers flexed against the strap of her leather satchel, the only outward sign of the discipline she was trying to force upon herself.
     <em>
      Get a grip,
     </em>
     she thought. She had always prided herself on being unshakable. Dedicated, focused, and utterly removed from the petty dramas that plagued lesser academics. Whatever this strange pull toward Rio Vidal was, it had to be extinguished.
     <em>
      You cannot get distracted today. You have a lab to run, research to oversee, and deadlines to meet. This fixation with Rio Vidal is neither relevant nor acceptable.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought of Rio unsettled her in ways she couldn’t name. That sharp wit, the quiet confidence, the maddening smirk that always seemed a fraction too knowing. It was enough to make anyone bristle. But
     <em>
      bristle
     </em>
     wasn’t the right word for what Rio made her feel, was it? Agatha shook her head, as though the motion could physically dislodge the train of thought. There was no time for foolishness. Not just because it was unprofessional, but because it made her feel off-balance, something she could not afford.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Today, I am in control.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She exhaled sharply, her breath visible in the cold, and stepped inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lab was quiet, the kind of quiet Agatha relished. The overhead lights buzzed faintly, illuminating the sterile space filled with equipment, trays of glass slides, and the hum of possibilities. It was 7:45, fifteen minutes before she had told Rio to be here, but as she moved further inside, her footsteps echoing softly, she noticed someone already at one of the benches.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat with her sleeves pushed up and a faint smear of ink across her wrist, her dark hair half-tucked behind her ears. She was bent over a stack of papers, her hands steady as she flicked through them with meticulous care. Her usual air of nonchalance was replaced by something sharper, something that reminded Agatha, against her better judgment, why Professor Calderu had sent Rio to her lab in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the moment passed, and Rio, sensing Agatha’s presence, glanced up.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Morning, Dr Harkness," she said, her voice carrying that signature blend of challenge and sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha set her bag down on the counter with precision, smoothing the front of her tailored blazer as she turned toward Rio. "You're here early, Vidal," she said coolly. "Finally grasping the value of punctuality?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s lips curved into that maddening half-smile as she leaned back on her stool. "Well, I mean, you went to all the effort to keep me behind after yesterday’s session just to tell me to be in early. So, here I am." She said with a shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s lips thinned, though she refused to give Rio the satisfaction of a visible reaction.
     <em>
      Always with the clever answers,
     </em>
     she thought.
     <em>
      Always trying to see how far you can push.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let’s see if you can put that enthusiasm to productive use," she replied crisply, walking past Rio to the workstation where the new slides had been laid out. She retrieved a clipboard, scanning its contents before speaking again. "We’ll divide the work today. I’ll handle the slides from the control group, patients with Alzheimer’s only. And you," she continued, turning to Rio, "will focus on the experimental group, the slides from patients with
     <em>
      both
     </em>
     Alzheimer’s and epilepsy."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s expression shifted slightly, though it was difficult to tell whether it was intrigue or something else.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your job is critical," Agatha added, her tone firm. "If there’s any correlation to be found, it will likely appear here. I trust you understand the importance of precision in this task."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gave a small nod, her gaze steady. "Crystal clear."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watched her for a moment, then placed the clipboard down with deliberate care. Her hand lingered on the edge of the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Before you begin," she said, her voice taking on a sharper edge, "let’s test your understanding. Vidal, tell me, were are looking for deposits of Tau protein, correct?” Rio gave a small nod, “Well, how do we visualise these deposits on a microscope slide?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t miss a beat. Setting down her pipette, she turned toward Agatha fully, meeting her gaze with that same infuriating calm. "We use immunohistochemistry," she began, her voice steady. "The slides have been treated with an antibody specific to Tau, which binds to it. Then we apply a second antibody linked to a coloured enzyme to visualise the areas of Tau under the microscope. The deposits will show up as distinct coloured areas."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha held her gaze, searching for any hint of hesitation or inaccuracy in Rio’s answer. There was none. She didn’t respond immediately. She let the silence stretch, taking in the quiet confidence with which Rio had spoken. There was no over-explanation, no trace of uncertainty. It was the kind of answer Agatha might have given as a PhD student, and the realisation unsettled her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good," she said finally, her voice measured. She gave a small nod, stepping back. "Now get started."
    </p>
    <p>
     Without another word, Rio turned back to her work, her movements precise and deliberate. Agatha remained for a moment longer, watching as Rio began to set up her station. There was something undeniably magnetic about the way she carried herself, an assurance that Agatha found both enviable and infuriating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shaking her head slightly, Agatha returned to her own work. She had no time for distractions, least of all the kind Rio Vidal seemed to excel at causing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lab fell into a comfortable silence, broken only by the faint clatter of glassware and the occasional scribble of notes. Yet, beneath the surface, the tension remained, a current neither of them acknowledged but both were acutely aware of.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha focused on her slides, but every so often, her gaze flickered toward Rio, drawn as if by some invisible force. What was it about her? It wasn’t just the confidence or the skill; Agatha had worked with talented students before. There was something in Rio’s composure, the way she carried herself as though she were immune to the usual pressures of the lab, that unnerved her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s fingers tightened slightly around the edge of the microscope, and she forced herself to focus.
     <em>
      This is nothing. She’s just another student.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     But even as she thought it, Agatha knew she was lying to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hours ticked by in near silence, broken only by the soft rustle of papers, the faint hum of the centrifuge, and the occasional scratch of pen on paper. Agatha remained focused on her slides, eyes scanning for patterns, her brain filtering through years of accumulated expertise. But no matter how hard she tried to concentrate, her attention kept slipping.
    </p>
    <p>
     Each time she glanced toward Rio, she found herself unraveling a little.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s movements were fluid, precise, she handled the slides with a practiced ease that belied her youth, her brow furrowed in concentration. Every now and then, Agatha would tear her gaze away, chastising herself for her lack of discipline. But more often than not, when she glanced back up she’d find Rio already looking at her, a flicker of something mischievous sparking in her dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     When their eyes met, Rio would smirk, a subtle curve of her lips that infuriated Agatha more than it should. Rio would snap her head back down to her work with almost theatrical nonchalance, as if she’d been caught mid prank. Agatha, trying to maintain her composure, would roll her eyes and force herself to return to her own slides, her stomach knotting in a way she didn’t want to acknowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
     The minutes stretched into hours. They worked like that the whole time, silent, focused, but always hyperaware of the other’s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn’t until Rio gasped loudly beside her that the fragile equilibrium broke.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s head snapped up, her slide forgotten. "What’s the matter?" she asked sharply, more alarmed than she cared to admit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t respond immediately. She was staring at the microscope in front of her, her face lit with an intensity Agatha had never seen in her. "I just finished with the first set of slides," Rio said, her voice unsteady with excitement. "There’s... there’s a massive amount of Tau buildup in
     <em>
      all
     </em>
     of them."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked, processing the implications of this. Before she could respond, Rio was already typing something into the computer in front of her, her fingers flying over the keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What are you doing?" Agatha demanded, stepping closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just running the stats quickly." Rio replied, her voice distracted, her focus entirely on the monitor.
    </p>
    <p>
     The screen beeped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio froze for a moment, staring at the results. Then, in an action that caught Agatha completely off guard, she jumped to her feet, clasping her hands over her mouth. "Oh my god," she whispered through her fingers. “Oh my god!” She repeated, now closer to a yelp than anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s brow furrowed, alarmed by the uncharacteristic reaction. She walked briskly to Rio’s side. "What is it? Let me see."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stepped back, letting Agatha take her place at the computer. On the screen was a graph, the data plotted with unmistakable precision. At the top of the analysis, a number glinted in green:
     <strong>
      Correlation = 0.95
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s jaw dropped. "0.95?!" she said, incredulous. Her eyes darted hysterically between the data and Rio, searching for any sign of error. "Is that real? Are you sure you put in the numbers correctly?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, I’m sure!" She said, her voice breaking slightly, as if the weight of the discovery was just now hitting her. Rio rubbed her face with both hands, muttering under her breath, "Holy shit."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha allowed herself a small laugh of disbelief. "Yeah," she said quietly, her lips curling into a rare smile. "Holy shit is right."
    </p>
    <p>
     They stood there for a moment, side by side, staring at the screen. The enormity of what they had just uncovered settled over them like a tangible force. Agatha knew she should be focused on the implications of the discovery, the awards it would spawn, the doors it would open, the lives it might save. But she couldn’t stop herself from glancing over at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her expression was radiant, her usual cool demeanour completely stripped away, replaced by an almost childlike glee. Her eyes sparkled as she gazed at the data, and her smile was so unguarded, so utterly genuine, that Agatha felt something inside her soften.
    </p>
    <p>
     She should have been thinking about Tau deposits, about Alzheimer’s, about the groundbreaking work they were doing. But all she could think about was how Rio looked in that moment, as if she had just glimpsed a piece of the universe’s secret truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could stop herself, Agatha felt a small smile tugging at her lips. She didn’t fight it. Rio turned to her then, and their eyes met, the weight of their findings swirling unspoken between them. For a brief, dizzying moment, the boundaries Agatha had so carefully constructed seemed to blur.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wow," Agatha said softly, her voice almost reverent. “You… this is... impressive. Congratulations, Rio."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, her smile turning shy for the first time since Agatha had known her. "Yeah. We did good I guess." she said, her voice quiet but filled with awe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head slightly. "No," she said firmly, stepping closer, her expression serious. "
     <em>
      You
     </em>
     did good. This was your find. You suggested this project. You saw the potential here before anyone else." She gestured toward the screen, where the data still glimmered like a revelation. "You may be on your way to changing the field permanently."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s gaze snapped back to her, her grin faltering into something almost vulnerable. The words seemed to hit her, as though she hadn’t quite allowed herself to believe in the gravity of her own accomplishment until Agatha said it aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her grin returned slowly, wider than before, and it lit her entire face with an unguarded excitement. Agatha found herself momentarily disarmed by the purity of it. So different from Rio’s usual cocky smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha allowed her smile to grow as well. "Welcome to the club," she said, her tone lightening. "It feels good, doesn’t it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let out a disbelieving laugh, her hand raking through her dark hair as she tried to absorb everything. "Yeah," she said, her voice warm with amazement. "It really does."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s chest tightened at the sound of her laugh, at the way Rio’s voice carried an awe so genuine it was contagious. All she could think about was how Rio looked at this moment, so alive, so utterly present, her joy unfiltered.
    </p>
    <p>
     The weight of their discovery lingered between them, the moment stretched taut with unspoken meaning. Agatha felt herself drawn in despite herself, her carefully erected walls threatening to crumble. She had always prided herself on remaining untouchable, but right now, standing beside Rio, she felt undeniably human.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You should do something to celebrate," Agatha said finally. Her tone gentle but insistent, trying to pull them both back to reality. "This is a big moment in your career. You should be proud of yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio thought for a moment, then tilted her head as her smirk slowly returned. That teasing smirk that always left Agatha simultaneously amused and on edge. Agatha’s stomach flipped as she saw something brewing behind Rio’s dark eyes, the kind of idea that was bound to make her regret offering any kindness at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Actually.” Rio said, drawing out the word as though savouring it, "I think I just might have an idea." She straightened, crossing her arms loosely over her chest. "Dr. Harkness," she began, her voice light and mockingly formal, "Would you like to get a drink with me? You know, just to celebrate, of course.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The words hit Agatha like a jolt, her stomach tightening with alarm. She blinked at Rio, stunned. "Excuse me?" she managed, her voice sharp with disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk widened, clearly enjoying her reaction. "I mean," she said with exaggerated innocence, "You’re just as much a part of this project as I am. Come on, just a drink. We need to celebrate somehow, right?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha opened her mouth to argue, but no words came out. This was a bad idea. This was a
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     bad idea. The lines she had so carefully drawn between herself and her students were suddenly blurring, smudged by Rio’s unrelenting confidence. A drink? The idea felt so casual, so wildly inappropriate, and yet...
    </p>
    <p>
     She glanced at Rio again, her expression caught somewhere between disbelief and exasperation. Rio was grinning now, wide and unrepentant, her earlier vulnerability completely replaced by her trademark audacity.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You’re insane," Agatha muttered, rolling her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hmm maybe that’s true.” Rio replied, “But, you know you want to say yes." She quipped, her tone maddeningly light.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every part of Agatha’s mind screamed at her to refuse, to put an end to this before it spiralled further. But the words wouldn’t come. Her eyes flicked again to Rio, at the gleam in her eyes, the flush of triumph still colouring her cheeks, and something inside her wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha swallowed hard, her throat suddenly dry. Against every ounce of better judgment she possessed, she heard herself say, "Sure, why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s face lit up instantly, her smirk giving way to a grin so radiant it almost knocked the air out of Agatha’s lungs. "Great," she said, already reaching for her coat, her movements brimming with energy. "You won’t regret it, I promise."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wasn’t so sure about that. Her pulse quickened as she watched Rio shrug on her coat, her confidence so assured it was almost contagious.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was a mistake. A massive mistake. But as she found herself following Rio to the door, a small part of her couldn’t help but think that maybe, just maybe, this wasn’t the worst idea she’d ever had.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or maybe it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sighed inwardly, following Rio toward the lab door. Only time would tell.

    <p>
     The cold night air clung to Agatha's skin, sharp and biting against the heat lingering from the lab. She hadn't planned on following Rio. Hadn't planned on anything, really. But here she was, her feet crunching against the frost-tipped pavement, trailing after her student.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moved with that effortless confidence that had been grating on Agatha's nerves since the day they met. Even now, as the wind tugged at her coat and the darkness wrapped around them, she walked like she owned the street, her head tilted slightly, hands tucked in her pockets, as if this were all some grand joke she was in on.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio turned, her smirk was already in place, sharp and knowing. Agatha tried to steel herself, but the expression still lit a fire in her chest. Half anger, half something she was scared to name. Agatha’s shoulers shuddered again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Here,” Rio said suddenly, pulling her scarf from around her neck and holding it out. The motion was casual, like it meant nothing at all. But her eyes, bright with amusement, gave her away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t need it,” Agatha replied, her voice clipped as she waved the offer away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t budge. “Oh, come on. I’m just repaying the favour.” The smirk grew as she added, “For when you lent me yours. Remember?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched, and she hated herself for it. Damn Rio and her audacity. “Fine,” she muttered, snatching the scarf and wrapping it quickly around herself, as if speed might diminish the intimacy of the gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fabric was warm against her skin, and she couldn’t stop the sigh of relief that escaped her lips. It carried the faint, scent of Rio’s perfume. Something subtle and grounding, citrus. She pulled the scarf tighter, more for the cold than anything else, she told herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched her with a smugness that made Agatha want to roll her eyes again. “So,” Rio said, breaking the silence, “Where are we going?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilted her head, mirroring Rio’s smirk with one of her own. If Rio was going to mess with her head, she might as well return the favour.
     <em>
      Two can play this game,
     </em>
     she thought, the corner of her mouth twitching upward.
    </p>
    <p>
     They reached the next corner, and Agatha let her hand brush the small of Rio’s back, a light touch, fleeting but deliberate. She felt the faintest twitch of surprise from Rio and bit back a grin.
     <em>
      Gotcha.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “This way,” Agatha said smoothly, guiding Rio around the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shot her a sidelong glance, her smirk momentarily faltering before she caught herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled softly, her breath fogging in the cold air. “There’s a pub just around here. I used to go there all the time when I was doing my PhD.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh that must’ve been a
     <em>
      while
     </em>
     ago,” Rio teased, and Agatha fought the urge to laugh outright, instead just rolling her eyes at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     They reached the pub, a cozy, unassuming place with warm light spilling onto the street from its fogged-up windows. Laughter and the hum of conversation greeted them as Agatha pushed the door open, the scent of beer and roasted peanuts wafting out to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio paused in the doorway, turning to raise an eyebrow at Agatha, who held the door and gestured into the pub. “Ladies first,” Agatha said, the smirk on her face razor-sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio placed a hand over her chest in mock astonishment. “Well, how kind of you.” Her laugh was warm and easy as she stepped inside, and Agatha couldn’t help the slight curve of her lips as she followed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha followed Rio into the pub, the familiar hum of laughter and clinking glasses enveloping them as the warmth chased away the evening chill. She took a moment to glance around, a twinge of nostalgia creeping in as she spotted the familiar faded wood of the bar and the same peeling poster advertising live music nights. It had been years since she’d last stepped foot in this place, and yet, it felt oddly unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s voice cut through her thoughts. “Well, this is cozy,” she said, sliding into a table at the corner. She propped her elbows on the table and leaned forward, her dark eyes glinting with amusement. “Can’t imagine you hanging out here, though. Seems too... lively for someone as refined as you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised a brow as she slipped into the seat across from her, the scarf still wrapped snugly around her neck. “Don’t let the lab coat fool you, Vidal. I had a life before I became
     <em>
      The Wicked Witch.
     </em>
     ” Her tone was light, but her gaze sharpened, daring Rio to make another quip.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I have no doubt,” Rio replied, a grin spreading across her face. “Let me guess. You were the type to sit in the corner, nursing a single drink while brooding over your thesis?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked, leaning forward slightly, her fingers tapping rhythmically on the edge of the table. “Well, you're not entirely wrong,” she said, her voice laced with amusement. “I wasn’t exactly known for my social skills back then. But I certainly didn’t
     <em>
      brood
     </em>
     over my thesis. It was more like... strategise. Plot. Overthrowing the establishment, one breakthrough at a time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's grin widened, and she leaned forward, elbows back on the table, clearly enjoying the banter. “Ah yes, now I see. This does seem like the perfect spot for plotting world domination.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes as she leaned forward, mirroring Rio. “Oh, please. If I were plotting world domination, I wouldn’t waste my time in a place like this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, a low, warm sound that sent a ripple of something through Agatha that she refused to name. “Of course not. You’d be in a secret underground lair, probably with a dozen whiteboards and and diagrams and a plan that’s been in the works for decades.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked, letting the jab roll off her. “You sound awfully confident for someone who would clearly be one of my minions.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio arched an eyebrow, leaning further forward on her elbows with that insufferable smirk of hers. “Minion? Oh no, if anything, I’d be the one challenging you for the throne.” Rio said as she laughed, the sound warm, unguarded. It caught Agatha off guard, and she found herself smiling despite herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, then,” Rio said, tilting her head. “What’s your poison, Dr. Harkness? Let me guess, you’re a red wine type? Something dry, probably with a name no one can pronounce.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. “You’re insufferable.” But she couldn’t help the smirk tugging at her lips. “And wrong. I’ll take a gin and tonic.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let out a low laugh, standing and heading toward the bar. “Oh, well, my apologies then. One gin and tonic coming right up.” she said over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watched her go, her gaze lingering a moment longer than it should have. Shaking her head, she exhaled slowly and glanced around the room, trying to ground herself. What was she even doing here? It wasn’t like her to follow her students out for drinks, especially not students who tested her patience at every turn. And yet, there was something about Rio, her irreverence, her sharp wit, the way she seemed utterly unbothered by Agatha’s authority, that drew her in. No matter how much she tried to resist it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio returned a few minutes later, balancing two glasses with surprising grace. She set the gin and tonic down in front of Agatha before sliding back into her seat, her own glass of amber liquid catching the dim light.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whiskey?” Agatha asked, arching a brow.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Scotch,” Rio corrected. “Neat.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course,” Agatha muttered, lifting her glass and taking a sip. The cool, crisp taste was a welcome distraction from the warmth that still lingered in her chest. A warmth she decided to blame on the scarf and not on the woman sitting across from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So,” Rio said, her gaze fixed on Agatha who finally removed the scarf from around her neck, “What were you like back then? During your PhD? Let me guess. Impossibly brilliant, impossibly intimidating, and maybe a little insufferable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled despite herself. “You’re not entirely wrong.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I knew it.” Rio leaned back, her smirk softening into something almost genuine. “You’re still all those things, by the way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze, her glass halfway to her lips. The comment wasn’t delivered with Rio’s usual sarcasm; it was quiet, almost sincere. She cleared her throat, setting the glass down with a soft clink. “Careful, Vidal. You’re dangerously close to sounding like you admire me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grin returned, sharp and teasing. “Oh, I wouldn’t go that far.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, but there was no mistaking the faint flush that crept up her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a slow sip from her glass, watching Agatha with a thoughtful expression. “So, what was your first breakthrough?” she asked, her voice casual, though there was an underlying curiosity there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s fingers curled around her glass as she leaned back in her seat, the question pulling her away from the easy banter they’d been exchanging. She took a moment, a flicker of something deeper passing through her gaze before she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My first breakthrough?” Agatha raised an eyebrow, the question tugging her back to a memory she hadn't visited in years. She leaned back in her chair, swirling her drink thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It really wasn’t some
     <em>
      eureka
     </em>
     moment," she said slowly, her gaze turning distant for a moment. "It was a gradual thing. It was when I was working on neuroplasticity in Alzheimer's models. It wasn’t flashy, but it shifted the way we thought about long-term memory consolidation. I remember sitting in the lab for hours and hours. Running the same experiments over and over, waiting for that one result. When it came, I was… well, I was shocked. But also, I knew then that I could do more than just follow the path laid out by others."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, clearly impressed. Her voice softened just a fraction. "Sounds like you were unstoppable. How did it feel, in the moment? To know you'd changed the game?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha considered the question, her fingers absently tracing the rim of her glass. "It felt like freedom. Like all the rules I’d been following up to that point didn’t matter anymore. It was terrifying, too. Because suddenly, everyone expects you to do more, to live up to that moment."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk faded slightly, replaced by a genuine curiosity. "I get that. The pressure must’ve been unreal." Agatha met her gaze, her heart giving an unexpected lurch at the quiet intensity behind Rio’s words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha met her gaze, the weight of Rio’s attention settling over her like a cloak. She nodded. But before she could add anything else, Rio leaned in, her voice turning teasing once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, I’ve been wondering. What does the esteemed Dr. Agatha Harkness do in her free time?” she asked, leaning forward again, eyes twinkling with the familiar spark of mischief. “I can’t help but imagine you just sitting and reading neuroscience papers all evening when you go home. Please tell me you have actual hobbies.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed, rolling her eyes, the tension easing for a brief second. “I have hobbies, Vidal,” she said, a teasing edge in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned in further, her elbows resting on the table. “Oh yeah? I don’t believe you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, unimpressed by Rio’s challenge. “I’ll have you know I’m an avid TV watcher in my free time. This stays between us, though, because I’m not proud of it, but... I’ve been on my third rewatch of
     <em>
      Grey’s Anatomy
     </em>
     .” She glanced down at her lap, a flush creeping up her neck as she admitted it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio froze, her eyes widening in surprise. “
     <em>
      Grey’s Anatomy
     </em>
     ?!” she nearly shouted, her voice rising a few octaves, all trace of her usual coolness gone. “Wow, I was not expecting that. You are full of surprises.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt the heat rise in her cheeks, desperately wishing she could sink into the floor. “Don’t make it worse, Vidal,” she muttered, glancing back up, her tone half-amused, half-exasperated.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio, clearly enjoying the moment, slapped her hand down on the table with a laugh. “I can’t believe it. Dr. Harkness, the unapproachable, terrifying neuroscientist, is obsessed with Grey’s Anatomy*.* That’s... that’s gold.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, desperately trying to reclaim her composure. “It’s a guilty pleasure, alright?” she said, though the lightness in her voice betrayed her words. “Can we just pretend this conversation never happened?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned back, shaking her head, her smirk never wavering. “Never. This is too good. I’ll be telling the whole lab about it, you know. ‘Did you know Dr. Harkness watches
     <em>
      Grey’s Anatomy
     </em>
     religiously?’”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shot her a warning look, but Rio was already teasing her in her usual way. “I’m never going to let this go,” Rio said, eyes still gleaming with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed, but the irritation was half-hearted. She took another sip of her gin, then glanced at Rio. “Alright, fine. What about you? What do you do in your free time?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow, her gaze turning reflective for a moment. “Well, I play electric guitar. I play in a band sometimes.” She said it so casually.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this new information hit Agatha harder than she expected. She froze for a moment, the image of Rio with a guitar in her hands, eyes focused and intent, sent a jolt through Agatha’s chest. Her breath caught for a fraction of a second before she quickly composed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      No, no. Stop it, Harkness.
     </em>
     She snapped herself out of the mental haze, forcing her eyes back to Rio, only to find her looking at her with that annoyingly self-assured smirk
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cleared her throat, breaking her gaze from Rio’s. “A band?” she repeated, forcing her voice to sound light. “Now
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     I didn’t expect.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned back, her grin broadening, clearly noticing Agatha’s momentary lapse and revelling in it. "Yeah. You’d be surprised how many people don’t guess that about me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha swallowed hard, her gaze fixed on the table as she tried to focus, to reign herself in.
     <em>
      Focus.
     </em>
     She took another sip of her gin, her hands suddenly feeling a little too warm around the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a silence then, the kind that stretched long enough to feel almost tangible, both of them caught in an unspoken moment. Agatha tried to shake off the effect Rio’s words were having on her, but she couldn’t quite manage it. Rio’s presence, her confidence, her very
     <em>
      ease,
     </em>
     it was starting to chip away at the walls Agatha had so carefully constructed around herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     And in that quiet, fleeting moment, the tension between them became palpable. It wasn’t just the banter anymore. It wasn’t just the challenge or the sparring. There was something else, something undeniably magnetic.
    </p>
    <p>
     The soft hum of the pub faded as Agatha realised she was looking at Rio, really looking at her, like she hadn’t before. And Rio, for her part, seemed to sense the shift. Her smirk softened, her gaze becoming unreadable as she studied Agatha in return.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So,” Rio began, her voice smooth, low, and teasing, “You look like you’ve got a thousand questions. Go ahead, ask away. I’ll answer anything”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, her pulse quickening despite herself. “Oh, I’m sure you would.” Her voice was sharp, but there was something in her tone, something unspoken. She leaned back slightly, crossing her arms, trying to regain some semblance of control. “I’m curious, though... You, in a band? That’s definitely not what I expected from someone who’s so quick in the lab.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk never faltered. “Yeah, well, you’d be surprised what a little music can do to loosen up someone like me,” she said, leaning in just enough to make Agatha feel the heat of her presence. “Maybe you should try it sometime.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath caught slightly at the suggestive tone in Rio’s voice. She forced herself to meet Rio’s gaze, her eyes narrowing as she fought the sudden wave of heat that rose in her chest. “You think I need loosening up?” Agatha’s words were quiet but charged, each one deliberate, a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grin widened, a mix of amusement and something else that Agatha couldn’t quite place. “Well, maybe not
     <em>
      need
     </em>
     ... but I think it could do you some good.” Her eyes dropped for a moment, grazed over the lines of Agatha’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s heart thudded harder. She swallowed, trying to keep her composure. “I have no interest in picking up a guitar, thank you very much.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow, leaning forward until there was barely a sliver of space between them. “Who says you need to pick up a guitar? Everyone has different ways of relaxing.” Her voice dropped lower, smoother, each word laced with something dangerous, something that made Agatha’s pulse jump. “Maybe all you need to loosen up is a little... company.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze for a moment, the air thickening between them as Rio’s words landed. She forced a small, controlled laugh, but it came out breathier than she intended. “Company, huh? You think you’re the one to loosen me up?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk deepened, eyes locking onto Agatha’s, as if she was daring her to back down. “I think I might be just the person for the job.” She straightened, glancing around the pub casually, but there was a flicker of something mischievous in her eyes. “But, then again, maybe you prefer to do everything on your own. Can’t let anyone
     <em>
      distract
     </em>
     you, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s lips parted for a moment, her mind fighting to keep up with the sudden change in their conversation. This girl had read right through her. She felt that familiar, tight coil of tension in her chest. It was one thing to have witty exchanges with her students, to put them in their place, but Rio was different. And now, with that playful challenge lingering in the air, Agatha wasn’t sure how much longer she could keep her walls intact.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned in slightly, her voice dropping to match Rio’s tone, the challenge now firmly in her words. “You’re getting awfully bold, Vidal. You sure you want to push your luck?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t flinch. If anything, her smile widened. “Boldness is kind of my thing.” Her voice was playful, but there was a flicker of something darker underneath it, a promise. “But I think you know that, don’t you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath caught for a moment. The way Rio’s gaze held hers, steady, sure, pulled her in like a magnetic force, and it was getting harder and harder to maintain her distance. Rio wasn’t just a student. She wasn’t just a challenge to be managed. She was something else entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And please,” Rio continued, her smirk growing ever-wider, “you should call me Rio. You know, now that you’ve told me your deepest darkest secret. I still cannot believe you… Grey’s anatomy… seriously?’
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shut up.” Agatha respond with a light-hearted scoff. Rio leaned back, crossing her arms with a satisfied grin, clearly enjoying the effect she was having. Agatha could feel the tension hanging between them like a delicate thread, stretched taut and threatening to snap at any moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, what now?” Rio asked, her voice casual but laced with an edge. “You going to keep trying to maintain control... or are you going to finally admit that I’ve got you a little... off balance?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha thought about the situation she was in, the ridiculousness of it all. Sitting across from Rio Vidal in a crowded pub, engaging in banter that felt far too charged to be entirely innocent.
     <em>
      What am I doing here?
     </em>
     she asked herself, but the answer was already painfully obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her thoughts drifted to Rio. The way her smirk seemed permanently etched on her lips, effortlessly cocky and infuriatingly charming. About the way her dark hair fell around her face, framing her sharp features with an effortless kind of beauty that felt almost unfair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s tongue ran lazily over her teeth in a motion that Agatha could only describe as maddening, she was seemingly amused at how caught off-guard Agatha seemed to be. It made Agatha’s stomach twist in ways she didn’t want to analyse. She was losing herself in the little details, her chest tightening as her thoughts spiralled.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      This is not good. Not good at all.
     </em>
     Agatha straightened in her seat, gripping the edge of the table as if it might ground her. Her head started to swirl, and sure, she could blame it on the gin, but one drink was nothing. She was too self-aware, too sharp to let herself believe it was the alcohol.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, Agatha Harkness wasn’t stupid. She knew exactly what was happening.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had known for weeks, in fact. Every quip, every smug look, every defiant word Rio had thrown her way, it had all chipped away at her defences. She’d convinced herself that her irritation was strictly professional, that Rio’s overconfidence simply grated on her nerves. But she couldn’t deny it anymore. The spark she felt wasn’t anger, and the truth had been pressing in on her like a rising tide.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every time she saw that smirk on Rio’s lips, she wanted, no,
     <em>
      needed,
     </em>
     to wipe it away. She wanted to grab her by the collar and kiss the stupid grin off her face. That night outside the lab. The teasing, the electricity in the air. It hadn’t been an accident. Not entirely. She could keep telling herself it was just a moment of weakness, a lapse in judgment, but deep down, she knew it had been something else. And now here she was, sitting across from the source of her undoing, feeling her control slip with every passing second.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was too much.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cleared her throat, a sharp sound that made Rio’s eyebrow lift in curiosity. She placed her hand on the table, pushing herself to her feet with as much composure as she could muster. “I need some air,” she said, her voice a touch steadier than she expected. “I’m just going to step outside quickly.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head, her arms lazily crossing over her chest as she leaned back in her chair. That damned smirk crept back across her lips, her dark eyes glittering as she said nothing, just watching Agatha with that insufferable confidence that made her stomach twist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha straightened, pulling her coat around her shoulders. “I’m fine,” she added quickly, her voice too sharp, too defensive. “It’s just... hot in here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk widened. She knew that Rio wasn’t fooled by her excuses, not even a little bit.
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned on her heel before Rio could respond, but she could feel her gaze following her, could practically
     <em>
      hear
     </em>
     the smug amusement in her silence. She walked to the back of the pub. Each step a little too fast, her heartbeat pounding louder with every passing second.

    <p>
     Agatha pushed the door open and stepped out, the cold air was a relief, biting against her skin and dragging her back to reality. She stepped into the alley behind the pub, pressing her back against the brick wall and tilting her face up toward the night sky. Her breaths came fast and shallow, and she exhaled slowly, forcing herself to take in the icy air and let it settle the chaos in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      This is ridiculous,
     </em>
     she thought.
     <em>
      You’re not a teenager. You’re a grown woman, a professor, for God’s sake. Get it together.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     But it didn’t matter how much she tried to rationalise it. The image of Rio leaning forward, that smirk softening just enough to make Agatha’s heart stutter, was seared into her mind. And the worst part? She didn’t want to let it go.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha crouched down in the alley, her forehead resting against her knees as she tried to ground herself. The cold air helped, but not nearly enough. Her mind raced, spinning with thoughts she was struggling to suppress. Every inch of her felt on edge, heightened by the weight of what had just happened inside, the way Rio’s gaze seemed to pierce through her. But it was the last thing Agatha had wanted. Becoming so… undone.
     <em>
      Pull it together, Harkness,
     </em>
     she silently chastised herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then she heard it: the faintest click. Agatha's heart skipped a beat as she stood up, lifting her head to see her, of course, standing in the doorway to the pub, Rio Vidal. Looking effortlessly in control as always. Her dark eyes glinted in the dim light of the alley, a smirk playing on her lips as she leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Really? Could I just have one moment alone to spiral without her showing up?
     </em>
     Agatha thought bitterly. But it was too late now. Rio was here, and she wasn’t backing down.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hey," Rio greeted casually, her gaze scanning Agatha from head to toe. She seemed to take in the way Agatha the way she stood opposite her, leaning against the wall for support, breath shallow, body tense. "What’s wrong? Someone got you all worked up?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, her frustration bubbling up. She couldn’t start spiralling again, not now. Not with Rio here. “Shut up,” she bit out, trying to mask how her heart was racing at the sound of that infuriatingly smooth voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled softly, not phased in the slightest by Agatha's biting tone. She pushed off from the doorframe, stepping forward into the alley, her movements deliberate and confident. Agatha's breath caught in her throat as she found herself unable to look away. She couldn't think. She couldn't focus. Every step Rio took only brought her closer, closer, until Agatha was struggling to breathe under the weight of the tension that crackled between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do you want, Rio?" Agatha managed, though her voice wavered more than she cared to admit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio simply scoffed, raising an eyebrow with that trademark smirk she always wore. “Agatha,” she drawled, and the sound of her name on Rio’s lips made Agatha’s chest tighten.
     <em>
      Damn it.
     </em>
     "I think you know what I want. And I have a feeling that you want it too."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head quickly, trying to regain some semblance of control. She attempted a shrug, though it came out as awkward and forced. “I have no idea what you’re talking about, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The smirk on Rio’s face widened, and she stepped even closer, until the space between them was almost nonexistent. "Oh?" she said with a playful scoff, "So you want me to say it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha met her gaze head-on, biting back the confusion and desire swirling inside her. She didn’t want to hear it, she couldn’t. But when Rio took another step forward, her voice dropping lower, that smirk still in place, Agatha’s resolve began to crack. "Fine. I’ll tell you what I want, Agatha."
    </p>
    <p>
     Another step. Now they were so close that Agatha could feel the heat radiating from Rio’s body. She tilted her head slightly, eyes gleaming in the dim alley as she whispered, her breath warm against Agatha’s skin, "I want
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     . That’s what I want. But I think you knew that, didn’t you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched at the words, the sound coming out more like a whimper than anything she could control. Her mind raced, her heart pounding, and she could feel her whole body betraying her. She tried to push the words out, to fight against it. “Rio, I—this is so unprofessional. I can’t—"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised a finger slowly, gently, to Agatha’s lips, silencing her protests. She tilted her head with an almost imperceptible smirk. “That’s not what I asked, and you know it,” she said, voice low and stern, almost coaxing. The tone sent a jolt right through Agatha’s body “Forget what’s professional. Forget your rules.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's body shuddered, her pulse roaring in her ears as Rio ran her tongue over her bottom teeth in that way that made Agatha’s knees feel weak. Rio's voice dropped even further, soft and dangerous as she leaned down, her lips barely brushing Agatha’s ear. "Now tell me." she whispered, "What is it that
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     want, Agatha?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s whole body shuddered again at the closeness, the words, the impossible tension between them. She had tried to resist, to push it away, but Rio's presence, her words shattered every defence Agatha had carefully built over the years. Her eyes met Rio's, wide and desperate, and before she even realised it, the words came spilling out.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, fine. You. Okay? I want you.” The words left her lips before she could stop them, the heat rising to her cheeks as the words echoed in the silence between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's smirk barely had a chance to stretch across her face before she was seizing the back of Agatha’s neck, pulling her with a force that stole the breath from her lungs. Before Agatha could process, Rio’s lips were crashing against hers, demanding and urgent. Agatha gasped against Rio’s mouth as she was pushed back against the wall of the alley, the stone rough against her back as Rio’s body pressed into hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were no more words. No thoughts. There was nothing but the heat between them, the desperate urgency of the kiss, the feeling of something unspoken finally coming to the surface, overwhelming and undeniable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's breath hitched as Rio deepened the kiss, her lips moulded to hers own, urgent and unrelenting. She hummed softly into Rio’s mouth. The wall behind her felt like the only thing holding her upright as Rio's hands moved over her shoulders, her neck, her hair, with an ease that made Agatha's mind spin. It wasn’t just the kiss that was overwhelming; it was the way Rio seemed to take control in a way Agatha had never experienced. Completely, effortlessly, and with a confidence that made her pulse race.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a fleeting second, Agatha forgot where she was, what she was doing. She forgot all about the boundaries she had so carefully erected, the rules she had made for herself, the walls she had convinced herself were impenetrable. All she could focus on was the heat of Rio’s body pressed against hers, her lips, her tongue, the faint taste of scotch on Rio’s lips, bold and intoxicating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pulled away just enough to make Agatha gasp, her lips brushing against Agatha’s as she spoke, her voice low and full of that familiar teasing tone. “Did you really think you could ignore this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's head spun. She blinked up at Rio, her heart thundering in her chest. The smirk on Rio’s face was replaced with something darker now, something hungrier. Agatha tried to clear her head, tried to focus on the whirlwind of thoughts crashing into her mind, but it was no use. Her gaze dropped to Rio’s lips, then back up to her eyes, and for a second, she thought she might lose control again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I—” Agatha's voice faltered, and she cursed herself for it. Her fingers were trembling, and she placed them flat against the cold wall behind her for support, but it didn’t stop the rush of emotions flooding her system.
     <em>
      This is a mistake,
     </em>
     she thought.
     <em>
      I should really walk away.
     </em>
     But everything inside her screamed otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smile softened, and she moved her hand from the back of Agathas neck to tangle in her hair, her other hand coming to Agatha’s chin, tilting Agatha’s face up towards hers. “You can fight it if you want, Agatha. But we both know it’s already too late.” Her voice was dangerously close, so close that Agatha could feel the words vibrate through her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could feel the weight of it all. The tension, the unspoken need between them, the quiet, chaotic storm of feelings she had tried so hard to bury. The rational part of her knew this was crossing a line, that this wasn’t just about a moment of weakness. This was something more. Something she wasn’t ready to face.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio wasn’t giving her the space to hide. She moved her hand away from Agatha’s chin and Agatha felt herself whine at the loss.
     <em>
      Whine? What on earth is this girl doing to me.
     </em>
     Agatha thought as she felt Rio’s fingers move to brush against her jaw instead, her thumb lightly grazing the curve of Agatha’s lip. “You don’t have to be afraid of this,” she murmured, her gaze softening, though there was still that undeniable hunger in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The words hit Agatha harder than anything Rio had said so far. She could feel her resistance crack, her control slipping further. The reality of the situation, the two of them, alone, in the cold alley, with nothing but their chemistry between them was almost too much. Her breath grew shallow, and she felt herself leaning into the touch. Unable to resist the pull, she brought her hands up, grasping the collar of Rio’s coat and pulling her in.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a swift movement, Rio’s lips were on hers again, this time slower, more deliberate. Agatha’s hands instinctively reached for Rio, threading through her dark hair as she gave herself up to the kiss. Her body, her mind, every part of her. She was drowning in this feeling, in the undeniable tension between them that had been building for weeks, and now, there was no turning back.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio finally pulled away, Agatha’s chest was rising and falling rapidly, and she could barely catch her breath. Rio smiled, a slow, knowing smile, before brushing her thumb across Agatha’s cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's heart was racing, her hands shaking as she flicked her tongue out over her lips, the taste of Rio still lingering, she didn’t miss the way Rio’s eyes flicked back down to her lips at the action. She couldn’t believe she had let it go this far. Couldn’t believe she had given in so easily. But there was no denying it, everything about this moment felt
     <em>
      right
     </em>
     , even if it terrified her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not… I’m not supposed to do this,” Agatha whispered, though her voice lacked conviction and her lips curled into a smile. She knew Rio had seen right through her; she was already too far gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed softly, stepping back, only enough to let Agatha breathe, but Agatha couldn't help but wish she could tug her back. “Who says you can’t?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a shaky breath, her mind swirling with confusion and desire. “This isn’t… professional,” she said, the words tasting like a half-hearted excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head, her eyes glinting in the dim light. “Forget professional. Forget all of it, Agatha. We’re not in the lab right now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath still trembled, and for a long moment, she simply stood there, unable to process what had just happened. She looked at Rio, her chest tight, her thoughts in a blur.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio reached out, her fingers brushing Agatha’s wrist, and the simple touch sent a jolt through her system. “What now?” she asked, her voice almost a whisper, soft and intimate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t wait for an answer. Instead, she leaned in once more, her lips brushing Agatha’s in a kiss so soft, so tender it felt like a whisper. Agatha barely had time to register what was happening before Rio pulled away, her fingers coming up to brush Agatha’s cheek, lingering for just a moment too long.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio’s eyes met hers again, they weren’t teasing or sharp. They were warm, intense, and searching, as though she was memorising every detail of Agatha in this moment. But just as quickly, her expression shifted back into that familiar smirk, the one that both infuriated and captivated Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll see you tomorrow, Dr. Harkness,” Rio said, her voice low, almost a purr.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, with the same maddening confidence she always carried, she turned on her heel and strode back into the darkness, her steps unhurried, her silhouette fading into the soft glow of the streetlights beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t move. She couldn’t. She stood there, her back pressed against the cold brick wall, her breath uneven, her thoughts a chaotic storm. Her fingers brushed her lips, still tingling from the kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “What just happened?”
     </em>
     she murmured aloud, her voice barely audible over the distant hum of the city. She felt as if the ground beneath her had shifted. Rio Vidal had stepped into her life, rearranged her carefully constructed world with nothing more than her smirks, her sharp words, and the undeniable pull between them. And tonight felt like the tipping point, the moment when Agatha knew there was no going back.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as her pulse began to steady and her breathing evened out, a new thought crept in, one that both terrified and thrilled her in equal measure:
     <em>
      What if she didn’t want to go back?
     </em>
     Agatha stayed in the alley a moment longer, letting the cold air cool her flushed skin and trying desperately to regain her composure. Tomorrow, she would see Rio again. Tomorrow, she would have to face her, with the weight of this moment hanging between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     But tonight? Tonight, she let herself feel it. Just for a little while. The warmth in her chest, the ache in her stomach, the lingering taste of Rio on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     With one last glance down the empty alley, Agatha straightened herself and headed back inside, her mind still spinning, her heart still pounding. She had no idea what tomorrow would bring, but one thing was certain: Rio Vidal was a complication she wasn’t ready for. And maybe, just maybe, she didn’t mind.

    <p>
     Agatha woke to a soft haze of morning light filtering through the curtains. For a blissful, fleeting moment, she felt peaceful, suspended in the quiet calm of the early hour. Then it all hit her like a shock of cold water and her eyes snapped open.
    </p>
    <p>
     Last night. The pub. Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shuddered, slapping her hands over her eyes as if that could erase the image. But it didn’t. Instead, it brought her right back. Rio’s face above hers, her hands on Agatha’s neck. Her mouth, hungry and insistent. Taking what she wanted. The memory alone sent a ripple of heat through her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She groaned in frustration, pressing her palms against her closed eyelids, rubbing as if she could physically remove the memory of Rio’s lips, the way her hands tangled in her hair, firm but somehow also so,
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     gentle. It was intoxicating. Agatha shuddered again at the wave of heat flooding her chest. She wanted to be disgusted. Feel ashamed. She tried to summon the appropriate horror for her complete lack of self-control. But instead, her lips betrayed her with the smallest, softest smile. The haze of the moment lingered, as vivid as if it were happening all over again. She shouldn’t be feeling this,
     <em>
      couldn’t
     </em>
     be feeling this. And yet, the warmth of Rio’s touch, the raw energy of it, lingered in a way that was impossible to ignore.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuuuuckkk,” she muttered into her palms. letting out another groan.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deep down, she’d known for some time what her feelings were. She had refused to name them with all the effort she could muster. But being forced to confront them so directly last night was… emotional whiplash, to say the least.
     <em>
      No,
     </em>
     she told herself firmly, dropping her hands from her face and forcing herself to sit up as if bracing against her own thoughts. She refused to let this affect her. Whatever Rio Vidal made her feel was irrelevant. She had a lab to run, and she would do it with poise. With authority. With control.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha dressed with purpose, choosing a pair of wide-legged grey trousers and a crisp white button-up shirt. Basic, yes, but sleek and commanding. She glanced at herself in the mirror, smoothing her hair into place, and squared her shoulders. She would radiate authority.
     <em>
      Command the room.
     </em>
     But as she stepped out of her house and into the cool morning air, her mind began to spiral. She needed a plan. Needed to figure out how to handle Rio, how to maintain her composure. The walk to the lab was long enough for her to rack her brain for a solution, but nothing came.
    </p>
    <p>
     What could she even say to Rio after last night? Should she pretend it hadn’t happened? Act cold, distant? Would Rio even bring it up?
     <em>
      Sorry, I let myself get swept up in your reckless, impulsive energy and kissed you like I wasn’t your goddamn supervisor?
     </em>
     And what would Rio say back? Rio, with her sharp wit and self-assured smirk. Rio, who never seemed to flinch, who took everything Agatha threw at her and tossed it right back without even breaking a sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
     And worse still, could she even survive being in the same room as Rio without picturing her leaning in close, her fingers tilting Agatha’s chin up, her body pressing close, her breath warm and intoxicating.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Stop,”
     </em>
     Agatha hissed aloud, startling a passing cyclist.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose as she approached the lab. She needed to focus on the day ahead. There was no time for indulgent self-reflection. The slides they’d been working on yesterday needed further analysis. Whatever breakthrough they’d stumbled upon required verification. On top of that, her other students needed her attention. She hadn’t seen much of their progress this week, and it was time to oversee their skills and organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she’d loom over them a little, she thought darkly. Frighten them, just enough to remind them that her lab was not a place for comfort. Only focus, discipline, and hard work.
    </p>
    <p>
     The irony of her own lack of focus wasn’t lost on her.
     <em>
      This would all be much be more convincing if I could actually practice what I preach.
     </em>
     Agatha thought wryly. Instead, here she was, drowning in distraction. An infuriating distraction with dark eyes and a maddeningly self-assured smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pushed open the heavy lab doors, the chill of the air-conditioning hitting her skin as she stepped inside. The hum of machines and the faint scent of disinfectant greeted her, grounding her momentarily. She glanced around, Billy and Alice were sat at one bench, their heads bent together over a set of notes, while Jen was methodically pipetting samples at another station. No sign of Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Good. Strange, she was usually here far earlier than the others. But good.
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned sharply on her heel and made a beeline straight for the bathroom down the hall, her composure already fraying. Her breath came shallow as she shut the door firmly behind her and leant against it for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Get it together,” she muttered, pushing herself toward the sink.
    </p>
    <p>
     She gripped the edge of the basin, staring at her reflection in the mirror. Her gaze darted over her face, searching for cracks in the armour she so carefully maintained. The flush in her cheeks was too bright, her lips pressed too tight, and her eyes betrayed her completely as memories of last night came flooding back.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I want you, Agatha.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The words slammed into her like a wave, sending an involuntary shudder down her spine. She squeezed her eyes closed, shaking her head as if that could shake the echo of Rio’s voice, low and husky, the weight of her confession hanging in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as Agatha’s breath steadied, a realisation began to dawn, cutting through the haze of her swirling thoughts. Rio…
     <em>
      wanted her
     </em>
     . Rio, with her infuriating smirk, her sharp tongue, her unrelenting confidence, was just as distracted as she was. Agatha had seen the way her gaze lingered too long on her, the way her confidence seemed to sharpen whenever Agatha was near, the subtle, betraying shifts in her expression when she thought Agatha wasn’t looking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well. Agatha straightened, her grip on the sink loosening.
     <em>
      Two can play at this game.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her lips quirked into a slow smile as the idea took root. Rio had been toying with her for weeks, getting under her skin, unraveling her composure bit by bit. It was only fair to return the favour. She’d spent far too long flustered and off balance, it was time for her to tip the scales.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still watching herself in the mirror, Agatha reached up and tugged at the clip holding her bun in place. Her dark hair tumbled down around her shoulders in soft waves, a stark contrast to her usual polished look. She ran her fingers through it, mussing it slightly, letting the strands fall around her face. Her hands moved to the collar of her shirt. One button popped open, then another. The curve of her collarbone peeked out now.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a low chuckle, she whispered to the empty room, “If I thought I was being unprofessional before…”
    </p>
    <p>
     But she didn’t stop. She untucked one side of her shirt and rolled up the sleeves to her elbows, the casual disarray sending a clear, intentional message. Her lips curled upward as she reached for her lipstick, swiping the deep colour over her lips. She leaned back to appraise her reflection. The professional sheen was still there, but now it was layered with something else. Something calculated. Dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
     With one last look, she nodded to herself, plastered on a smirk, and turned toward the door. Her stride was confident as she exited the bathroom, her head held high. Whatever Rio Vidal thought she’d started, Agatha was ready to finish. She stepped into the lab, her head held high and her stride measured. Her eyes scanned the room. Billy and Alice were deep in a discussion at one of the benches, while Jen was still diligently working through her pipetting And then, just to the right of her, there was Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s pulse quickened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked like she’d just arrived, shrugging her leather jacket off her shoulders as she swung her bag down onto the chair next to her. She moved quickly, pulling out her laptop and a notebook, the ease of her movements undercut by something almost… distracted. She hadn’t seen Agatha yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused just inside the door, her lips curling into the faintest smile. There was an opportunity here. Too good to pass up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Straightening her shoulders, she walked purposefully toward Jen’s station, each step deliberate, her heels clicking sharply on the tiled floor. She stopped just to her left, so that Rio was in her eyeline, leaning forwards to brace her hands on the bench next to Jen. Her proximity made Jen jump slightly, her eyes darting up in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning, Dr. Harkness,” Jen blurted, her voice a little higher than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilted her head, her dark eyes sliding sideways to where Rio was unpacking her things. And then it happened. Rio glanced up, no doubt prompted by Jen’s greeting, and froze. Agatha caught see the exact moment Rio’s gaze landed on her, the way it trailed slowly, almost helplessly, from the tousled waves of her hair, down to the undone buttons of her shirt, and lower still.
    </p>
    <p>
     She watched Rio swallow hard, her jaw tightening. A faint flush crept up her neck and her pupils widened as she took her in. It was all there, clear as day. By the time Rio’s eyes finally reached Agatha’s face, her expression was utterly unguarded. Caught somewhere between shocked and completely disarmed. Agatha bit back a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Flustered.
     </em>
     Rio Vidal was well and truly flustered. Agatha resisted the urge to smirk outright. She had never seen Rio like this before. The girl was all sharp retorts and unshakable confidence, but now she looked, for lack of a better word,
     <em>
      wrecked
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The knowledge sent a thrill through Agatha, but she kept her expression cool, professional, her focus returning to Jen. She let her fingers graze lightly against Jen’s back as she said, “Morning, Jennifer.” Her voice was calm, deliberate, the kind of tone that invited, no, commanded attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen blinked up at her, looking both startled and a little awed. Agatha leaned closer, glancing at the computer in front of Jen, taking her time to read the lines of text. But she didn’t need to glance sideways to know Rio’s eyes were still on her. She could
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     them, burning into her skin like sunlight through a magnifying glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, wow!” Agatha exclaimed, straightening slightly. “It seems like Jennifer has made brilliant progress. I see you’ve already sent in your requests for your project materials. Truly a milestone, Jennifer. Congratulations!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen flushed, stumbling over a soft, “Thank you, Dr. Harkness,” as Agatha gave her a small, approving nod.
    </p>
    <p>
     She glanced at Rio again, she couldn’t help it, and was rewarded with the sight of her sitting there frozen, a pencil halfway to her notebook. She had managed to compose herself just enough to pick her jaw off the floor. The smirk had returned, but there was something incredulous about it, like she couldn’t quite believe what she was hearing. Agatha could tell Rio was dying to interject, to point out the genuinely groundbreaking discovery she had made yesterday, something far more significant than submitting a request for materials. But Rio was holding her tongue, likely sensing this deliberate power play on Agatha’s part.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let herself revel in the moment, her smile widening slightly. But then Rio seemed to catch herself, she shifted her weight, a clumsy attempt at regaining composure. When Rio’s gaze met hers again, there was no smirk this time. Only wide eyed disbelief and a tension that screamed vulnerability. She was utterly off balance, and Agatha was loving every second of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Straightening, Agatha patted Jen on the back. “Keep up the excellent work,” she said smoothly, her tone warm but authoritative.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes darted back to Rio, who had finally sat down, her hands gripping the arms of the chair like it was the only thing anchoring her. Agatha let her gaze linger on Rio for just a moment longer, taking in the way Rio gripped the edge of the desk, knuckles white against the dark surface. The uncharacteristic tension in her posture was fascinating, especially for someone who normally carried herself like she had the entire world eating out of the palm of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha didn’t say a word to her. Not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, she turned her attention back to Jen, whose screen still displayed a spreadsheet of inventory requests. Agatha leaned closer, one hand still resting lightly on Jen’s back. “Tell me, Jennifer,” she said smoothly, her voice soft but deliberate, “Have you already outlined how you’ll allocate these materials? I’d love to see how you’re planning to structure your experiments. Planning is everything, after all.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen nodded quickly, almost too eagerly, and pulled up another document. “Yes, I’ve started drafting that here,” she said, her voice still tinged with nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed approvingly, but her eyes flicked back to Rio for the briefest of moments. She was leaning back in her chair now, one hand running through her hair as she watched Agatha with a smirk that didn’t quite reach her eyes. The tension in her jaw, the way her fingers tapped rhythmically against the desk. It was all too telling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was that... jealousy? The thought sent a rush of satisfaction through Agatha’s chest. She lingered beside Jen a moment longer, keeping her tone warm and encouraging. “This kind of attention to detail is what makes a reseracher truly exceptional,” she said, letting the words hang in the air for a beat. Then she glanced at Rio again, raising an eyebrow as if to say,
     <em>
      Are you paying attention?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk twitched, faltering for a fraction of a second.
    </p>
    <p>
     Satisfied, Agatha straightened and moved to where Billy and Alice were working, her heels clicking softly against the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy looked up first, his face lighting up with a sheepish smile. “Morning, Dr. Harkness,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning,” Agatha replied smoothly. She stepped closer, folding her arms as she glanced over their notes. “And where are we with the timeline for your experiments? I trust you’re both staying on schedule?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice nodded firmly. “We’re both nearly done with our preliminary setups. Just a few more adjustments.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Excellent,” Agatha said, nodding. She glanced back toward Rio, who was still in her chair, pretending to review her laptop screen. Pretending, because every few seconds, her gaze flicked up toward Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned back to Billy and Alice, her lips curling into a faint smile. “Remember,” she said, her voice lilting slightly, “a good scientist knows when to be patient and when to act decisively. Timing is everything, wouldn’t you agree?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She cast another quick glance at Rio, who had stopped tapping her fingers and was now staring outright, her smirk slipping into something sharper, more disbelieving.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha absentmindedly picked up a piece of paper from the desk and begun flipping through their notes with deliberate care. “Good work. Ensuring you are focused is critical, though,” she added, her voice dipping slightly, her gaze still on the papers in her hand. “It can be a challenge to stay focused when…
     <em>
      distractions
     </em>
     arise.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She dared a glance up at Rio. She was leaning back in her chair now, her arms crossed . This time, Rio raised an eyebrow at her, her lips parting slightly as if to say,
     <em>
      Are you serious right now?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt a smug satisfaction settle in her chest as she moved on, stopping briefly to comment on Alice’s notes before finally turning toward Rio. There was a certain delicious pleasure in leaving Rio in that state. Disoriented, distracted, and caught completely off guard. The cat and mouse game they had begun to play was one Agatha was more than capable of winning.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on, Vidal,” she said at last, her voice light, almost disinterested, as she strode purposefully to the other end of the lab, where the slides from the previous night had been neatly laid out. “We have more slides to examine.” Her tone was casual, almost indifferent, but beneath it was an underlying edge, one that Rio wouldn’t be able to ignore.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head slightly, the corner of her mouth twitching into that familiar smirk, the one Agatha knew too well. But there was something off about it this time, something different in the way Rio moved as she pushed herself out of her chair. Rio followed after her, but the change didn’t go unnoticed. Agatha had pushed a button, and Rio was struggling to keep it together.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, Dr. Harkness,” Rio drawled, her voice low, the faintest edge of annoyance creeping in. “You’re certainly making your rounds today.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t respond immediately, letting her footsteps echo as she walked with deliberate slowness toward their workstation. She could feel Rio’s gaze on her back, but she didn’t break her stride. She wanted Rio to chase this moment, wanted her to feel the tension building with every passing second. When she reached the desk, she casually glanced at the slides. It was all about control. Rio’s presence, her gaze, her every reaction. It was all part of the game now.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jennifer’s making good progress, don’t you think?” Agatha remarked lightly, before turning back to Rio. She could see Rio’s jaw tighten, her posture shifting, but Agatha pushed on. “What about you? Are you… alright this morning?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked, momentarily thrown off by the unexpected question. Agatha could tell she was trying to regain control, but it was slipping. She was unraveling, and Agatha could practically taste her discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I’m fine,” Rio replied quickly, sitting down in her chair and brushing off the question with a flick of her wrist, but there was something strained in her voice. “Perfectly fine, Dr. Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Really? You look… a little off today,” Agatha said smoothly, eyes narrowing as she leaned against the edge of the desk. She let her gaze linger just a little too long. “Distracted, maybe?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk faltered for a split second, a flicker of frustration passing across her features, but it was gone in an instant as she straightened her posture. “Oh, everything’s fine,” Rio replied, her voice laced with forced nonchalance as she stared up at Agatha. “Though I couldn’t help but notice you’ve been very attentive to everyone else today.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, her lips curving into a smile as she took in Rio’s shift in energy. “Attentiveness is important in leadership,” she said lightly. “It fosters trust and sets expectations.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed, her fingers drumming against the desk. “Is that so? Because to me, it looked more like a performance.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed softly, letting the sound fill the space between them. “A performance? Whatever do you mean?” she asked, her tone almost mockingly innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio eyes narrowed, but her gaze was fixed firmly on Agatha. “You’re something else, you know that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t even try to hide the smirk that spread across her face. Oh, she was enjoying this far too much. The power she held over Rio was intoxicating. And then, just like that, Agatha’s mind flickered with a new idea. She took a step forward, enjoying the way Rio’s eyes followed her every move from below her. With a sudden, calculated motion, Agatha leaned across Rio’s chair to reach for the slides on the desk beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s breath hitched sharply, a subtle but unmistakable shift in the air as Agatha’s body hovered just above hers. For a split second, the world seemed to narrow down to the proximity between them. Agatha could almost feel the tension in the space between them, before she casually picked up the slides with a smirk. She could hear Rio’s breath catch again, this time a little louder. Agatha relished the sound, savouring the effect she had on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a final glance at Rio, Agatha moved to sit down across from her. She didn’t look up at Rio right away; instead, she focused on the slides in front of her, her fingers brushing over the surface as she slowly examined them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So,” Agatha began, her voice low and smooth, her eyes still fixed on the slides in her lap “last night’s... discovery.” She almost laughed to herself at that. The double meaning, the innuendo, it was too perfect. She shot a quick glance at Rio, just in time to see her jaw slacken slightly. Rio had clearly thought Agatha wouldn’t bring it up, but now she was left stuttering to maintain control.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t help but enjoy the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     She forced her gaze back down to the slides, but not before she caught the brief glimmer of defiance flickering in Rio’s eyes. “Ah yes, the discovery,” Rio drawled finally, her voice low, but Agatha could hear the tension building beneath the surface. “I trust you’re… satisfied with my performance, Dr. Harkness?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath caught in her chest. The words had the opposite effect of what she’d intended. She could feel herself getting rattled. No. This wasn’t supposed to happen. She was supposed to be the one in control. Agatha Harkness didn’t lose control. Last night was just an anomaly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She glanced up at Rio, her breath steadying. She placed the slides back on the desk, the soft sound of the glass against the table punctuating the moment. “Oh, I’m more than satisfied, Rio,” she said, her voice lowering just slightly, every word deliberate. Agatha leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees, and let her eyes briefly flicker over Rio. She noticed Rio’s eyes flick down for just a second, lingering on the open neckline of her blouse. Agatha’s lips curled into a slow, knowing smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well,” Agatha said, straightening herself and letting her voice cut through the charged silence, “We should get a move on with these slides, shouldn’t we? We still have 9 more sets to get through before we can confirm the results from yesterday.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio arched an eyebrow but said nothing as she reached for the next batch of slides with a small nod. Agatha did the same, flipping through the patient data, the steady rhythm of her own breath grounding her. For a while, they worked silently, the clinking of glass slides and the faint scratching of notes filling the space between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then, out of the corner of her eye, Agatha noticed it. Rio was staring at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused, not looking up immediately. She let the weight of Rio’s gaze settle on her before finally lifting her head, one eyebrow raised. “Vidal,” she said smoothly, her tone laced with mock admonishment, “You might want to focus on the work instead of staring. Or were you hoping I’d do all the heavy lifting for you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked, clearly not expecting Agatha to call her out. But then Rio’s eyes turned darker, regaining that defiant, teasing edge and Agatha’s breath hitched. The tension was palpable, the air thick with unspoken words as Rio leaned back in her chair with that maddening smirk creeping across her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Caught me,” she said, her voice dripping with amusement. “Though I’d argue you’re the one making it difficult to focus.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilted her head, pretending to consider this. “Interesting excuse. Though I can’t say I’m surprised. It must be terribly distracting working with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Terribly,” Rio replied, her grin widening.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned squarely toward Rio, resting her elbows on her knees again and letting her chin lean her clasped hands. She’d perfected this pose. She knew the effect it had, especially on Rio. She’d seen that flicker of something beneath Rio’s usual confidence. She shifted her weight, silently enjoying the subtle unease she had already planted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, do you actually intend to focus on the slides today, Vidal, or is this just an opportunity to gawk at me?” Agatha asked, her voice smooth, testing the waters. She was keenly aware of the slight hitch in Rio’s breath when she spoke. Just enough of a sign that Agatha’s words had landed, but not enough for Rio to show any real weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio snorted softly, setting down the glass slide she had been inspecting. “Oh, I’m focusing,” she replied, her tone light but charged. “It’s just… there’s a lot to focus on today.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s lips quirked slightly, and she leaned back in her chair, shifting her gaze to the edge of the desk. She could feel Rio’s eyes on her as she spoke. Curious, almost dangerous. “Really? And here I thought the patient data would have your full attention. Should I be concerned that your attention is… elsewhere?” She let the words hang in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned back in her chair, twirling her pen between her fingers. Agatha watched her, waiting for the inevitable retort. “I’m always paying attention, Dr. Harkness. Especially when something” She paused, her gaze sweeping deliberately over Agatha’s face for a moment too long. “…particularly interesting is in front of me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s pulse picked up, and she struggled to keep her face neutral. She had to remind herself she was the one in control here. She had started this little game, after all. “Careful, Rio. ” she murmured, her voice dropping, laced with something teasing yet sharp. “You’re treading on dangerous ground. If you’re not careful, you might say something you’ll regret.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Regret?” Rio scoffed, her voice low and playful. “I don’t regret much, Dr. Harkness. In fact, if last night taught me anything, it’s that-”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s heart stuttered in her chest, and she interrupted with barely controlled impatience. “Vidal. I’m warning you.” Her tone was sharper now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up at her, an expression of exaggerated surprise plastered on her face as she gasped dramatically “What? I **was talking about our breakthrough. I meant that I won’t regret any part of the project.” Her voice was mockingly innocent, but Agatha could hear the playful lilt to it, ‘Why? What did
     <em>

     </em>
     think I was talking about?’ Rio said, batting her eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha exhaled slowly, rolling here eyes. Her thoughts were racing, but she kept her exterior calm. “Let’s just get back to the task at hand, shall we?” She didn’t look at Rio again as she reached for another slide, her fingers almost shaking with the tension that had built up between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a while, they worked in silence again. Or at least, Agatha tried to. She could feel Rio beside her, and every now and then, catching the briefest glance from the corner of her eye. Agatha knew Rio was watching her, but she refused to let herself respond. She focused, determined to stay on task, even as the energy between them crackled.
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn’t take long before Rio broke the silence. “You know,” she said casually, as though the last few moments hadn’t happened, “If I may say so, you seem awfully on edge today.” Her voice was thick with unspoken meaning, and Agatha could feel the tease in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “On edge?” Agatha repeated, her tone incredulous. “Please, Vidal. If anyone’s on edge, it’s you.” She tried to regain the upper hand, but the warmth in her chest was spreading now, and it made her feel almost... exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh?” Rio’s eyebrow arched, a flicker of amusement in her eyes. “And what makes you so sure of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Call it an observation,” Agatha said, her voice cool, but her fingers suddenly restless on the table. “You’ve been squirming in your seat all morning.” She couldn’t resist the challenge in her voice, the satisfaction she took from seeing Rio lose some of her composure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio barked out a laugh, but the faint blush creeping up her neck didn’t escape Agatha’s notice. “Squirming? That’s a bold accusation, Dr. Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Bold, but accurate,” Agatha countered, her smirk returning. She couldn’t help it—there was something so satisfying about pushing Rio’s buttons, watching her control slip, even just for a moment. The silence stretched between them again, but this time it was different. Agatha could feel the tension pulling tight like a wire. And she knew, just
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     , she had to keep pushing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, by the way, Dr. Harkness,” Rio said suddenly, her voice low, almost teasing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s head snapped up, her body suddenly tense, her attention shifting entirely to Rio. She felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end. “Yes?” she asked, her voice tight with anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned forward, her elbows resting on the table, closing the distance between them. Agatha’s eyes flicked to the space between them, and for the briefest moment, her breath caught. Their faces were close. Too close. But then she saw the others across the room, their backs to them, absorbed in their own work, and a sense of relief flooded her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio flicked her tongue out to wet her lips, and Agatha couldn’t help but follow the movement with her eyes. It was involuntary, a brief flicker of attention to something she hadn’t meant to notice. She forced herself to look back up into Rio’s eyes, but she was already caught.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dr. Harkness?” Rio’s voice was quieter now, almost mocking. Agatha felt her pulse quicken, but she was careful not to let it show. “Distracted?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? No. Of course not. What were you about to say?” Agatha’s voice cracked slightly, but she recovered quickly, clearing her throat. She could feel Rio’s amusement, the sharpness in her gaze. It rattled her more than she cared to admit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well,” she begun, her voice casual but tinged with satisfaction, “Professor Calderu mentioned I should update her on any major milestones in our PhD journeys.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s brow furrowed slightly, wary of where this was going. “Did she now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, her smirk deepening as she leaned back in her chair, breaking some of the tension but not all of it. “So, I shot her an email this morning about our findings.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And?” Agatha prompted, keeping her tone even despite the unease coiling in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk widened, as if she were savouring every second of this. “She was very impressed. And, as it turns out, so was the head of the dementia research department at Oxford.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked, momentarily thrown. “Oxford?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm hmm,” Rio confirmed, leaning back in her chair with an air of nonchalance that Agatha was certain was at least partially feigned. “Apparently, they’ve got an entire department focused on risk factors for dementia. Calderu reached out to them, and they were so interested in our findings that they’re sponsoring a two-day trip for us to give them a lecture. All expenses paid.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt the words hit her like a bucket of cold water. A trip. Overnight. With Rio. The implications spun wildly in her mind, each one more dangerous than the last.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, oblivious (or much more likely, entirely aware) of the turmoil she was causing, continued. “All we have to do is prepare a lecture for their faculty. And they’ve signed us up to attend a few other lectures while we’re there. Networking opportunities, you know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha struggled to form a coherent response. Her brain latched onto the professional aspects of the trip, desperately clinging to them like a lifeline. A lecture at Oxford was a prestigious opportunity, one that could mean everything for Rio’s budding career and for their research. It was, objectively, a huge win for their project.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then… there was the part of her that couldn’t ignore the sheer recklessness of spending two days in close quarters with Rio Vidal, the thought loomed far too large. No. This was a terrible idea. Completely unprofessional. Risky. And yet…
    </p>
    <p>
     A thrill of excitement sparked in her chest, unbidden but undeniable. The idea of presenting their work to one of the most prestigious institutions in the world was exhilarating. And, if she were honest with herself, so was the idea of spending two days with Rio, away from the lab, away from the others, away from the carefully maintained boundaries she’d always upheld.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oxford.” she repeated, as if saying it aloud would help her process the gravity of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, the full picture hit Agatha with an almost visceral force. As much as she was enjoying the game this morning, watching Rio squirm, prodding her into that state of frustrated composure and watching as she struggled to maintain control, this was crossing a line. No, it was obliterating the line. This trip wasn’t just risky; it was
     <em>
      insane
     </em>
     . She had made it a rule, a cardinal law etched into her very being, to
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     get romantically involved with anyone she worked with. And students? That rule didn’t just apply, it multiplied, compounded in its severity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her pulse quickened as she tried to focus on the logic. The solution seemed obvious. She simply wouldn’t go. Rio could take the lead at Oxford; it would be an incredible opportunity for her, a career milestone that would outshine most achievements at her stage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes. Agatha could step back, feign having another obligation, or perhaps claim she wanted Rio to have her moment in the spotlight. It would be a perfectly plausible, perfectly professional choice.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet. Her jaw tightened as her thoughts swirled. The chance to present their groundbreaking findings to one of the world’s foremost universities, the exposure for their lab would be monumental. The kind of opportunity that came along once in a lifetime. Her presence wasn’t just
     <em>
      important
     </em>
     ; it was
     <em>
      necessary
     </em>
     . For professional reasons only. Or, at least, that’s what she told herself as she let the idea of this trip burrow deeper into her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     It definitely wasn’t about Rio. It was completely, fully, 100% about the project. About the science. About their collective success. She repeated these justifications like a mantra, even as the thrill of anticipation curled low in her chest, refusing to be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
     She let out a quiet sigh, one that betrayed more of her inner turmoil than she’d intended. It was soft but audible in the stillness of the lab. “Well,” she said at last, her voice brisk, businesslike, “it sounds like a great opportunity. But, if we want more than one set of data to discuss in that lecture, I suggest we focus and get a move on with these slides.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t glance up, didn’t dare meet Rio’s gaze, but she could feel the shift in the room. There was a pause, a stillness that stretched just a fraction too long before Rio responded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right.” Rio’s voice was calm, but Agatha didn’t miss the slight furrow of her brows, the subtle shift in her posture. She seemed to notice the change in Agatha’s tone, in her demeanour, but to Agatha’s relief she didn’t comment on it. Instead, Rio gave a small nod and turned her attention back to the slides.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the rest of the afternoon, the lab settled into an uneasy quiet. The faint clicks and soft rustle of glass slides punctuated the silence as they worked. But Agatha could feel the weight of Rio’s eyes fliking up every few minutes, glancing at her from across the table. It wasn’t overt. It was subtle, almost imperceptible, but Agatha caught it each time in her periphery. Rio was watching her, as though trying to read her, to piece together whatever had caused the shift. Agatha kept her gaze firmly fixed on the microscope, her expression neutral.
    </p>
    <p>
     But inside, her thoughts churned relentlessly, a storm of logic and doubt and something far more dangerous, something she refused to name. Whatever it was, she buried it beneath a layer of composure, gripping the work in front of her like a lifeline.

    <p>
     Agatha strode purposefully through the hallways of the lab, the heels of her boots clicking against the floor. She needed to clear her mind of the chaos that had been consuming her since
     <em>
      that evening
     </em>
     . It had been a mistake, a lapse in judgment she wouldn’t allow herself to repeat. But of course, she knew better. She was well aware that she had been living in denial for weeks. The problem with being an expert on the brain was that she knew exactly what was at play in her mind: the avoidance, the cognitive dissonance, the internal tug of war between logic and reason. She would deal with that later, though. She pushed the thought aside as she reached the meeting room. Today wasn’t about her personal life. Today was about the future of neuroscience.
    </p>
    <p>
     The funding allocation meeting was the most cutthroat event of the year. The department’s senior scientists and students would battle for resources to push their projects forward. Agatha and Rio were on the edge of something groundbreaking, but without funding, progress would slow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha steeled herself as she stepped into the meeting room. The low hum of conversation filled the air, the tension was palpable. Everyone here knew what was at stake. Around the long, polished table sat her colleagues, the senior scientists whose opinions and votes would determine the future of their projects. Among them, perched along the edges of the room or huddled near the coffee station, were the students. Eager, hopeful for their slice of the funding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze swept across the room, noting who had arrived. Lilia Calderu was seated at the far end of the table. As usual, she exuded a composed authority that Agatha couldn’t help but envy. She straightened her posture. She couldn’t afford to lose focus today.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took her usual seat, setting her leather notebook on the table and pulling a pen from the inner pocket of her blazer. She opened to a blank page, jotting some notes in the top corner. The motion steadied her, a small act of control in a situation that could easily spiral into chaos. Today was important. The outcomes of this meeting could have major implications for their reserach. Today was not the day for distractions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just then, she heard the chair to her right scrape against the floor. She glanced up. Speak of the fucking devil.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio Vidal slid into the seat beside her with effortless confidence.. Agatha’s stomach tightened involuntarily, as her gaze caught on Rio’s green blouse, unbuttoned just enough to be noticed, her eyes lingering a moment too long. Rio cleared her throat, a pointed sound that carried a note of amusement. Agatha felt the heat rise in her cheeks. When she raised her head, Rio was watching her, an eyebrow raised in smug triumph. The corner of her mouth curled upward, as if to say
     <em>
      look who’s distracted now.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha exhaled slowly, her expression sharpening as she shot Rio a pointed look. Rio merely smirked in response, leaning back in her chair as if she had already won whatever unspoken game they were playing. Agatha tightened her grip on her pen, forcing herself to focus. The meeting hadn’t even started, and Rio was already testing her composure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not today. Agatha turned to Rio, her voice low and firm as she whispered, “There’s no time for your antics today. This meeting is really serious.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned back in her chair, scoffing lightly. “Dr. Harkness, I think you feed into my antics more than you think.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes narrowed, her gaze hardening. “Rio, I’m not joking. This is important. The future of our research depends on this. Do not cause a scene.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk faltered, she blinked, visibly caught off guard by Agatha’s use of her first name in such a professional setting. Her lips parted as though she might say something, but instead, she pressed them into a thin line, her teasing demeanour evaporating. What replaced it was a look of pure determination, one that Agatha couldn’t quite place but that sent a shiver down her spine.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Understood,” Rio said softly, nodding firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha barely had time to process the strange pull in her chest before Professor Calderu called the meeting to order. “Alright, let’s begin,” Calderu said, her tone brisk as she scanned the room. “We’ve got several proposals to review today. I’ll call your name, and you’ll have a few minutes to summarise your research and make your case. Let’s keep things concise.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Calderu motioned to the first researcher, a wiry man with glasses. “You’re up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He cleared his throat, rising from his chair. “Thank you, Professor Calderu. Our team is focused on mapping activation of cells in the early stages of Parkinson’s. We’re particularly interested in how the inflammatory response may contribute to the disease. Our data suggests that targeted treatments could significantly delay the onset of symptoms.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The department heads murmured among themselves as Calderu nodded. “Interesting. We’ll discuss allocation shortly. Next?”
    </p>
    <p>
     A sharp-looking woman with short hair stood. “Our team is investigating development of the brain while a foetus is in the womb, and how problems in this process can lead to an schizophrenia. We believe that there is a developmental aspect to schizophrenia before a child is even born, that there is an issue with the way the cells divide from the point of fertilisation and this can predispose a child to schizophrenia. We intend to use stem cells to replicate the growth of an embryo in order to study this process, with the aim of gaining a better understanding of how schizophrenia manifests.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The pitches continued, each more ambitious than the last, as the heads debated and assigned portions of the funding to each. Agatha listened carefully, keeping her expression unreadable. Finally, Calderu glanced at her clipboard and called, “Dr. Harkness and Miss Vidal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha exhaled slowly, steadying herself. This was her moment. She cleared her throat and glanced around the table, her gaze flickling to each department head in turn. It was all about power and control, Agatha’s forte. She leaned forward, her fingers on the table. “Thank you, Professor Calderu,” she began, her voice steady, calculated. “Our research focuses on a critical but underexplored question: whether seizures act as accelerators for degeneration in Alzheimer’s disease. Specifically, we’re examining how seizures may contribute to increased Tau deposition.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Calderu’s expression remained impassive, but Agatha caught the flicker of interest in a few of the department heads.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Our preliminary findings,” Agatha continued, “based on Miss Vidal’s work, suggest a strong correlation. In just one month, we’ve already identified evidence that seizures exacerbate Tau deposition. With further support, we believe this could lead to groundbreaking therapies to slow, or even prevent, Alzheimer’s.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She glanced at Rio, expecting her usual smirk or quip, but what she saw instead made her voice falter. Rio was staring up at her with wide eyes, her expression completely open and almost awestruck. She looked utterly captivated, as if Agatha’s words were the most profound thing she’d heard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt her pulse quicken, heat rising to her cheeks. She quickly turned her attention back to Calderu and concluded, “With the right funding, I know we can take this project from promising to revolutionary. Thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Calderu nodded, turning to the other department heads for discussion. Agatha leaned back in her chair. She exhaled and glanced at Rio again, she wasn’t smirking, nor was she wearing her usual air of defiance. Instead, she smiled at Agatha. Genuine, hopeful. Agatha glanced down and saw her fingers tightly crossed in her lap, her knuckles almost turning white from the force. Something about that gesture made Agatha’s heart stutter. It was so pure, almost… cute.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could dwell on the thought, Calderu cleared her throat. “We’ve reached a decision. You’ll be receiving three percent of the department’s funding.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze. “Three percent?” she repeated with a scoff, her voice sharp. “You must be joking.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Calderu met her glare with a calm, unyielding expression. “Dr. Harkness, your project is promising, but it’s also very new. We need to see more evidence of its potential before committing additional resources.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha opened her mouth, but no words came out. She couldn’t believe what she was hearing. Then, beside her, Rio stood. “Professor Calderu, you can’t be serious!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shot out a hand, tugging at Rio’s arm. “Vidal, sit down,” she hissed. “She’s made her decision, there’s nothing we can do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio shook her hand off, her gaze steady and unflinching. “No. I’m sorry, Dr. Harkness, I won’t sit down.” She turned back to Calderu, her voice rising. “With all due respect, Professor Calderu, this is complete bullshit!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The room let out a collective gasp. Agatha was frozen, all she could go was stare up at Rio. She could feel the eyes of the entire room burning into them, but Rio was undeterred, her voice resolute and fierce.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You were literally emailing me just yesterday about how incredible you thought our findings were,” Rio said, her voice rising slightly as she gestured toward Calderu. “We have a solid hypothesis. One that could help
     <em>
      millions
     </em>
     of people. Yes, we only started this project a month ago, but we already have results. Major results. That should count as a strength, not a strike against us!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s pulse was pounding, her hand hovering uselessly at her side as she stared up at Rio. This was not the casual, overconfident Rio she knew. This Rio was passionate, determined, and utterly unapologetic. She wasn’t just angry, she was
     <em>
      furious.
     </em>
     And it really was doing something terrible to Agatha’s brain. Rio’s cheeks were flushed with anger, her voice was filled with conviction, and to Agatha’s growing horror, she was finding this insanely attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Miss Vidal,” Calderu began, her tone cool but with a slight edge of warning.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio wasn’t finished. She turned to Agatha, their gazes locking as she pressed on, unwavering. “And don’t even get me started on the fact that
     <em>
      Dr. Agatha Harkness
     </em>
     is leading this project. Am I the only one who realizes the implications of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Holy shit.
     </em>
     Agatha blinked. This girl must be trying to kill her. She really must want Agatha to melt into a puddle on the meeting room floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned to address the room now, her voice loud. “Dr. Harkness is a legend in neuroscience. She has more awards and publications than everyone in this room combined! Any project she's involved in is sure to have everything thought out, every factor accounted for, every variable controlled!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh no.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This isn’t just some little PhD project. This is someone who
     <em>
      knows
     </em>
     how to push the boundaries of what’s possible. She
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     the cutting-edge.” Rio’s voice softened just slightly, her words turning into a challenge as her gaze swept the room. “If you can’t see the potential here, that’s your loss. But I promise you, this project will prove you wrong.” Rio finally sat down, her chest heaving slightly as she stared defiantly at Calderu.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t know where to look. The sheer intensity of Rio’s defense of their work,
     <em>
      of her,
     </em>
     had her heart pounding in ways it absolutely should not have been. She was aware of every small detail. The flush on Rio’s cheeks, the slight tremor in her hands, the way she’d said Agatha’s name like it was a badge of honour.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was well and truly falling apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Calderu exhaled slowly, flipping through her notes. “Fine,” she said at last. “Miss Vidal, since you feel so strongly, we’ll increase the allocation. Ten percent.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s head shot up, her eyes wide. “Really?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Calderu gave a curt nod. “But only because I agree that the preliminary data is promising. But do not question my judgement again, Vidal. And don't make me regret this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s face broke into a wide grin, and she turned to Agatha, her eyes lit with joy. It was so genuine that Agatha couldn’t help but return the smile. She bit her bottom lip to keep from laughing outright.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was... un-fucking-believable. As the next researcher began their pitch, Agatha leaned in close to Rio, her voice a whisper. “So much for not causing a scene.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smile faltered, her breath hitching as she glanced around the room. “I’m sorry,” she whispered back, her voice quiet. “I don’t know what came over me, I just-”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha placed a hand on Rio’s arm, cutting her off. Rio looked up sharply, meeting Agatha’s gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t you dare be sorry, Rio” Agatha said, her tone soft but firm. “You just got us ten percent of the department’s funding. Thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared at her, blinking rapidly before a small smile tugged at her lips. She nodded once, the determination in her eyes softening into something that looked almost vulnerable. Agatha leaned back in her seat, but she couldn’t stop the flicker of warmth in her chest. Rio Vidal was going to be the death of her. And, for once, Agatha wasn’t entirely sure she minded.

      GUYS THEYRE SO CUTE IM SOFT WTF 💔💔
     </p>
     <p>
      also !!!!! if u are interested in finding out more ab their research or any of the other studies that I talk ab in this chapter, I am currently putting together a thread of all the real studies that inspired the research in this fic, it will be up on my twt probably at the same time as the next chapter (I think)
     </p>
     <p>
      fun fact this chapter featured the topic that my research is on! stem-cell models of schizophrenia is what i'm studying so it was so fun to write it into this chapter aha !!
     </p>

    <p>
     When the funding meeting finally drew to a close, Agatha stood from her chair with a sigh, smoothing down her blazer. Rio mirrored her movements as she met Agatha’s gaze, her expression unreadable. They fell into step together, walking side by side down the hallway, the only sound was the rhythmic thud of their footsteps, but neither was ready to break the silence just yet. They were still slightly stunned by what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was Agatha who finally spoke, her voice calm and professional once more. “Right, if you could head back down to the lab and continue looking through the slides, that would be great.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned her head slightly, meeting Agatha’s gaze with that same unshakable confidence. She gave a small nod but said nothing, then began to turn down the corridor leading to the lab. Before Agatha could stop herself, the word slipped out. “Wait.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio paused mid step, glancing back over her shoulder with a raised eyebrow, curiosity lighting her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitated for a moment, then steeled herself, forcing her tone into something close enough to composed. “Thank you again. That was… a completely insane thing to do,” she said quietly, a small laugh escaping her lips despite herself. “But it worked. It worked very well.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s face softened, the corner of her mouth curling into a knowing smile. She chuckled quietly. “Well,” she said with a small shrug, “usually the most insane ways to do things are the ways that work.” With that, she turned and disappeared down the corridor toward the lab.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watched her go, the faintest hint of a smile tugging at her lips.
     <em>
      Unbelievable,
     </em>
     she thought to herself, as she lingered in the hallway, listening to the fading of her footsteps. With a deflated sigh, Agatha turned and headed back to her office.
    </p>
    <p>
     The door clicked shut behind her and she collapsed into her chair, running her hands over her face.
     <em>
      How the hell did I get myself into this mess?
     </em>
     Dr. Agatha Harkness, the Wicked Witch of the Lab, cold, calculating, professional. She had built her reputation on control. Yet here she was, falling apart over a girl. It was pathetic. Completely pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
     She groaned into her hands, her breath warm against her palms. Forcing the whirlwind of emotions to the back of her mind, she sat up straight, squared her shoulders, and opened her laptop. Her depression and Alzheimer’s proposal was nearly ready for submission. Just a few more tweaks, and she could send it off to journals for peer-review. Agatha latched onto the work like a drowning person reaching for a lifeboat, determined to find any stability she could muster in the data and analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hours slipped by unnoticed as she lost herself in her writing. Outside, the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the room into shadow. Only the pale glow of her desk lamp lit the stacks of papers and notebooks scattered on her desk. A knock at the door broke her from her focus. She blinked at the screen, momentarily disoriented. “Come in,” she called, finishing the sentence she was typing as the door creaked open.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,” came Rio’s voice, soft.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze mid sentence, her fingers hovering over her keyboard. When she looked up, Rio stood in the doorway, one hand on the frame, her expression relaxed but watchful. That usual air of confidence lingered, but there was something else beneath it tonight, something gentler. Agatha’s stomach tightened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gesturing to the chair across from her desk, Agatha cleared her throat. “What’s up, Rio? How are the slides coming along?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stepped in and took the offered seat, crossing one leg over the other with casual ease. “Great. I’ve gotten through half of the second set. I should be able to finish another one or two slides before I head out tonight.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded briskly, grateful for the straightforward answer. “That’s good. And they’re all following the same trend? Increased Tau in patients with seizures?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gave a small nod, her lips twitching upward. “Mm-hmm. Looks like we’ll have solid data to present when we go up to Oxford tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s heart sank at the mention of the trip. She had been trying not to think about it, sharing close quarters, hours spent together with the impossibility of avoiding the pull Rio seemed to exert on her. But now, with Rio sitting here, her presence filling the room in a way that felt impossible to ignore, the thought was unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha forced herself to clear her throat, her fingers tightening around the edge of her desk as if the solid wood might anchor her. The room suddenly felt unbearably small, the air dense with unspoken tension. She glanced at Rio, who sat sprawled in the chair opposite her, exuding her usual casualness. Her dark eyes were bright with curiosity, her head tilting ever so slightly as if to encourage Agatha to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, the other night…” The words came out rougher than she intended, her voice betraying the nerves she had tried to conceal. Rio’s eyebrows lifted in surprise, and Agatha caught the faintest flicker of amusement in her expression. She leaned forward, her interest clearly piqued. Agatha’s chest tightened at the shift, her heart thudding a little harder against her ribs. She took a steadying breath, willing her voice to stay even. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done that. It was inappropriate. An abuse of my power.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The corner of Rio’s mouth quirked upward, her lips curling into a sly smirk that sent a wave of frustration and something else, something dangerous, coursing through Agatha. “An abuse of power?” Rio repeated, her voice teasing and low, almost a whisper “Really? The way I remember it, you weren’t exactly in a position of power, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s jaw tightened, the heat rising to her cheeks betraying the irritation she had meant to suppress.
     <em>
      Of course she had to make this difficult.
     </em>
     “Can you just be quiet and let me finish,” she snapped, though her tone lacked any bite.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t respond, instead sitting back in her chair, her smirk unwavering. The movement made her look even more relaxed, as if she knew she had the upper hand, and it set Agatha on edge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, Agatha pressed on, her voice slow and calm despite her racing pulse. “Look, I won’t deny that I wanted it to happen. But it can’t happen again.” She shifted in her seat, her gaze locking onto Rio’s. The words felt heavy as they left her lips, but she forced herself to keep speaking. “It would be disastrous for the lab, for both ours careers, for the research. Do you understand?”
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, Rio didn’t answer. She just stared at Agatha, her sharp features softening as her smirk faded into something quieter, more reflective. The silence stretched between them, crackling with tension so thick it felt tangible. Finally, Rio gave a slow, measured nod. “Of course. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The way she said the title sent a ripple of unease through Agatha. There was no sarcasm, no teasing lilt. Instead, the words felt like a subtle acknowledgment of boundaries. Boundaries that Agatha wasn’t even sure she wanted to maintain. Maybe, just maybe, she thought, if Rio could respect those boundaries, she could manage to control herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then Rio leaned forward again, her movements deliberate and unhurried, her dark eyes glinting with something unreadable. Her voice was softer now as she said, “What I actually came to talk about was your research. Your depression and Alzheimer’s study.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked at her , caught off guard. “Oh?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, her gaze steady. “I know you’ve been focused on our study lately, and I just wanted to make sure it wasn’t interfering with your other work.” Her gaze softened slightly, her lips curving in a faint smile. “If you need help drafting, sending peer review requests, anything, I’d be happy to pitch in. I wouldn’t want your own paper to suffer because you’re stuck babysitting me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The offer struck Agatha like a slap. For a moment, she could only stare at Rio, unsure how to respond. She wasn’t used to this genuine, thoughtful side of her that seemed to slip through when she least expected it. It was disarming, and worse, it made her chest ache with something she couldn’t quite name. Then, unexpectedly, a small laugh escaped her. “That’s kind of you, Rio, but I’ve handled multiple projects simultaneously before. I’ll be fine.” Rio’s smile grew, a warmth in her expression that left Agatha feeling strangely vulnerable. Vulnerable enough to add “But if I ever need an extra hand, I know where to find you. Thank you for the offer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The silence that followed felt heavy with things unsaid. Rio’s gaze lingered, and Agatha could feel her resolve slipping under the weight of it. Finally, Rio gave a small nod and stood up, her usual smirk returning. “Well, goodnight, Dr. Harkness. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watched her leave, her footsteps echoing faintly in the quiet corridor beyond. The moment the door clicked shut, Agatha let out a long breath and dropped her forehead to the desk with a soft thud.
     <em>
      Oh god. What the hell am I doing?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind raced, spiralling too fast for her to catch hold of any single thought. She could just about handle Rio’s teasing, her sharp tongue, her relentless smirks. But this? This side of Rio, earnest, warm, and so annoyingly thoughtful, was going to undo her entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her pulse was still hammering, and Agatha could feel the flutter in her chest, the anxious knot tightening deeper with every second. She rubbed her face roughly with both hands, trying to stave off the overwhelming heat that had rushed to her cheeks. It wasn’t just the words, though, it was everything. The way Rio had looked at her, the genuine concern in her voice. It felt too much, too intense, and for a moment, Agatha felt like she couldn’t breathe, like the walls of her office were closing in on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      What the hell am I doing?
     </em>
     She needed to get a grip. She couldn’t afford to be falling apart like this, especially not over someone like Rio. She had spent years building a reputation for herself as the most controlled, the most focused researcher in the department. But here she was, becomiung a mess over a student, unable to think straight.
    </p>
    <p>
     She closed her eyes, drawing in a steadying breath, but the image of Rio, the teasing smile, the softness in her gaze, it kept flickering in her mind. Agatha's thoughts spun too fast. She needed distance, something to pull her back from the edge. She could feel the tension coiling in her stomach, the adrenaline still coursing through her veins.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pushed herself up from the desk, and paced around the room for a moment, trying to regain any semblance of control. Her fingers trembled.
     <em>
      Damn it,
     </em>
     why was she trembling? She cursed softly under her breath and reached into the drawer for her pack of cigarettes. Yes, typically she would only turn to them after one her mother's calls, but could you really blame her? She was well and truly crashing out over here. Tonight, she needed something, anything, to clear the chaos in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     She shrugged on her coat, making her way to the side door of the lab, the cool evening air offering a temporary escape from the suffocating warmth of her office. The cold stung her cheeks, but it was a welcome distraction from the mess she was in. She lit the cigarette with a flick of her lighter and inhaled, smoke filling her lungs. For a moment, she felt the tension ease, just enough to gather her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the reprieve was short-lived. She heard the door behind her creak open, and the sound of footsteps on the concrete made her stiffen instinctively. She didn’t need to turn around to know who it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” Agatha groaned, her frustration spilling out as she let her head fall back dramatically with another loud groan, closing her eyes in exasperation. “What are you doing here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She could hear Rio’s quiet chuckle behind her before she even turned to face her. When she did, she found Rio standing in the doorway, her posture easy and confident.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Same as you, by the looks of it.” Rio’s smirk was sly, knowing, as she took a few steps forward. “Why? Trying to avoid me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glared at her, but her heart was racing again, pulse thudding in her ears as Rio stepped closer to her.
     <em>
      Stop this. Just stop,
     </em>
     she told herself. But Rio’s gaze was steady, so intent, that Agatha couldn’t look away. She took another drag from her cigarette, exhaling slowly as she tried (and failed) to compose herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cocked an eyebrow. There was a teasing edge to her voice. “What happened to ‘not being a smoker,’ Dr Harkness?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha exhaled, the smoke curling around her as she turned her gaze back to Rio. “I told you, I’m not. I just needed to clear my head.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes narrowed slightly, a small laugh escaping her. She stepped even closer, her voice dropping low. “Clear your head, huh? So… I’ve driven you to substance use? Is that what you’re telling me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a sharp laugh. She muttered, “Shut up,” Her pulse getting quicker and quicker as Rio tilted her head and ran her tongue over her bottom teeth in that effortless way that drove Agatha insane. The tightness in her chest returned, and her breath caught.
     <em>
      Damn her. Damn her.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled softly, her voice barely above a whisper as she spoke. “What can I say? I just have that effect, I guess.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, running a hand through her hair as she ran her tongue over her teeth
     <em>
      yet again.
     </em>
     And suddenly, Agatha’s knees were weak. Her head was reeling. Her thoughts jumbled. She couldn’t take this anymore. Before she could even think, before she could stop herself, she moved.
    </p>
    <p>
     In one swift motion, she grabbed Rio’s collar and shoved her back against the cold brick wall of the building. Her lips crashed into Rio’s, hot, desperate, unrelenting. Silencing every thought, every reservation. Agatha’s mind was a blur of chaos and heat, but her body was surprisingly still, her movements controlled as she pressed Rio harder against the cold wall. Rio gasped into Agatha’s mouth as Agatha kissed her with purpose, her lips crashing into hers with so much force that there was no room for hesitation or second thoughts. There was no softness to it, no tentative exploration, Agatha was taking back control of everything that had been spiralling from her grasp over the last few days. The tension, the longing, all of it poured into the kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hands slid from Rio’s collar, settling firmly on the wall either side of her shoulders, holding her in place with an almost possessive grip. Agatha felt the warmth of Rio’s body against her own, the firm press of her chest, and it ignited something deeper, something primal inside her. She really didn’t care that it was wrong. She didn’t care about the consequences. All that mattered in this moment was the pull between them, the one she had been trying to fight for much too long.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s lips were insistent, taking what she wanted. She felt Rio tense beneath her for a moment, taken aback, before Rio’s hands finally found her waist, pulling her closer. But Agatha held the upper hand, her body firm against Rio’s, pushing her back into the stone behind her. She could feel Rio’s breath hitch in the space between their lips, the tiny gasp when Agatha nipped at her bottom lip, teasing her, just enough to make her tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s mouth parted under hers, and Agatha took advantage of the opening, her tongue sliding in to deepen the kiss. There was no hesitation now; Agatha was fully in control. She guided Rio, moving her hands to the back of Rio’s neck to pull her closer, the urgency building with each movement. Agatha could feel Rio’s pulse under her fingertips, the way she responded to every shift in Agatha’s body. Her breath quickened, but Agatha remained steady, her movements deliberate and commanding.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she pulled back for a brief second, her lips hovering inches from Rio’s, Agatha could see the wildness in her eyes as their gazes met, something raw, untamed, like a fire she had just sparked. Rio’s eyes drifted back to Agatha’s lips as she leaned in, this time more slowly, deeper, more deliberate.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she finally pulled away again, this time for good, her breath was shaky, but she manageed to meet Rio’s gaze, her eyes dark and intense. Agatha held her there, one hand still grasping her hair and the other flat against the wall above Rio’s shoulder. They were barely an inch apart, their lips still swollen from the kiss. Agatha’s body was still pressed to Rio’s, and she didn’t pull away. Instead, she let the moment hang, the tension lingering in the cold air. Rio was panting slightly, lips parted as if she couldn’t quite catch her breath. She met Agatha’s gaze, her expression a mixture of surprise and amusement. Her lips curled into a slow, knowing smile, and Agatha could see the change there, the shift in the way Rio looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     ‘So much for ‘this can never happen again’. I mean-” Rio started with a laugh, still breathless from the kiss, ‘you really have an astounding lack of self-control.’
    </p>
    <p>
     A smile spread across Agatha’s face as she dropped both hands to Rio’s shoulders, meeting her gaze with a bemused laugh. ‘Tell me about it.’
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilted her head slightly, her thumbs brushing against the fabric of Rio's shirt as she held her steady. The faint smirk on her lips betrayed more amusement than regret, though her mind was already cataloging the possible consequences of what she’d just done. Still, in this moment, with Rio pinned beneath her, eyes bright with mischief, it was hard to feel anything but exhilaration.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grin widened, her chest still rising and falling heavily as she caught her breath. She tilted her head, eyes sharp and playful. "You know, for someone who’s supposed to be my boss, you’ve got a real habit of breaking all your own rules."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, her fingers flexing slightly where they rested on Rio’s shoulders. The corner of her mouth tugged upward in a faint smirk. "And for someone who claims to be a model PhD student, you have a remarkable talent for provoking your boss into doing so."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed softly, the sound low and warm in the chilly night air. "Provoking? Is that what we’re calling it now?" She leaned in just enough for Agatha to feel the brush of her breath, her voice dropping. "I think you might be giving me too much credit."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Credit where credit is due." Agatha replied, her voice steady. "Maybe you’re infuriating, insubordinate, and entirely too smug for your own good. Yet, here we are."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio straightened, her own smirk never wavering. "You make it sound like
     <em>
      I’m
     </em>
     the one who dragged
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     out here and-" She gestured vaguely to the space between them, lips quirking upward. "-pinned
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     to the wall."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, though the flush creeping up her neck betrayed her. "God, you’re insufferable," she muttered, but there was no real bite to the words. “And don’t act so innocent. You know exactly what you’re doing, Rio. You’ve been pushing my buttons since the day you walked into this lab.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed at that, the sound warm and unguarded, and for a moment, it disarmed Agatha completely. “You’re not wrong,” Rio admitted, “But I didn’t think you’d ever snap like that. I underestimated you, Dr. Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, “Well, now you know. Push me far enough, and I push back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let out a laugh. “Well, yes. I can see that now.” She said, her smirk widening as she shifted gestured to where Agatha still had her pushed back against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t even start,” Agatha warned, though the edge in her voice was softened by the faintest hint of a smile. She let her hands slip from Rio’s shoulders, brushing down her arms before finally stepping back to finally put some distance between them, though it felt harder than it should have. Her pulse was still racing, and she could feel the heat of Rio’s gaze on her even as she tried to compose herself. She folded her arms across her chest, fixing Rio with a look that was equal parts stern and amused.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched her closely, her smirk fading into something more serious. “So, what now?” she asked, her voice quieter but no less challenging. “Do we just pretend this didn’t happen? Just go up to Oxford tomorrow and act like you didn’t just… kiss me senseless out here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitated, her hands falling to her sides. She looked at Rio, really looked at her. The flushed cheeks, the way her chest still rose and fell with uneven breaths. She felt a pang of something she couldn’t quite name, something dangerously close to affection.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s exactly what we do,” Agatha said finally, her voice firm despite the knot tightening in her stomach. “We move on. This-” she gestured between them, her lips pressing into a thin line, “-was a lapse in judgment.” But the moment she said the words she regretted them, she could already see the glint of amusement in Rio’s eyes, the way her lips quirked into that insufferable smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A lapse in judgment, huh?” Rio mused, drawing the words out with mock solemnity as she tapped her chin. “Now, where have I heard that before?” She made an exaggerated show of looking around, her eyes scanning the alley until they landed to their right. With a dramatic snap of her fingers, she pointed to the spot just to their right, where Agatha distinctly remembered their first almost-kiss. “Oh!” Rio exclaimed, her voice thick with playful innocence. “Right there, actually.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha crossed her arms tightly over her chest, as if that could shield her from the flood of heat rising to her face. “You’re enjoying this far too much.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned back to her, grin wide “Can you blame me? You’re usually so untouchable. Watching you fall apart like this…it’s fascinating.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fall apart?” Agatha repeated, her voice sharp as she straightened her spine. “I’m not falling apart.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk widened. “Aren’t you? Because, for someone who insists this was a mistake, you seem awfully… invested in justifying it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took a deliberate step closer, her heels clicking against the tile with a precision that matched the steely determination in her gaze. "What may or may not be invested in is none of your concern, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio just raised an eyebrow, letting out a small scoff, “Oh, really? So what do you suggest we do next then, just completely ignore whatever this is?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s jaw tightened, she took a slow, deliberate step forward, closing the gap between them once again. She met Rio’s gaze head-on, her expression calm but unyielding. “What we do next is we both forget this ever happened. You go home, and I… I get back to work."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled, her head tilting slightly as she watched Agatha. "You’re really something, you know that? All business, even after…" She gestured vaguely between them, her smirk returning. "Whatever that was."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t rise to the bait. Instead, she crossed her arms and gave Rio a pointed look. "I mean it, Rio. If you respect me at all, you’ll leave this alone."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio studied her for a long moment, her expression unreadable. Then, with a slow nod, she took a step back, her smirk softening into something gentler. “Alright, if that’s what you want.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is,” Agatha replied, though the words felt hollow even as she said them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hesitated, her gaze lingering on Agatha for just a fraction too long before she turned toward the door. “Goodnight, Agatha,” she said over her shoulder, her tone softer now, almost… tender.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Goodnight, Rio,” Agatha murmured, watching her leave. As the door clicked shut, she let out a breath she hadn’t realised she was holding. Her chest ached with the weight of everything that had happened. The tension getting tighter with every passing second.

    <p>
     The late afternoon sun cast a glow over Marylebone station as Agatha stood on the platform, her small suitcase at her side, one hand gripping the handle while the other fiddled absentmindedly with the edge of her scarf. She checked her watch and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Where was Rio?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze swept over the platform as she tugged her black trench coat tighter around herself. Irritation prickled at her, but it was laced with something less familiar. Anticipation, perhaps. Just then, a flash of movement caught her eye. Rio emerged from the stream of travellers, her stride casual. She raised one hand in a small wave, a smile starting to tug at her lips. Agatha felt her breath hitch before she could reign in her reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio approached, her bag slung over her shoulder. She was a vision of effortlessness, faded blue jeans, a black tank top that clung to her frame, and a loose leather jacket that shifted with each step. Agatha’s mouth went dry.
     <em>
      This is going to be a very long two days.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry I’m late,” Rio said, her eyes flicking over Agatha briefly, “Blame the Tube.” she wrapped her scarf tighter, shoving her free hand into the pocket of her jacket. “Fuck, it is freezing!” she muttered, her teeth flashing in a quick grin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha allowed a soft laugh to escape her. “Hello to you too.” she said, pulling her scarf tighter around her neck. “You know,” Agatha continued, unable to keep the amusement out of her voice, “If you wore something warmer than a tank top, you might not be so freezing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stopped, one eyebrow quirking as her smirk grew. “What, not a fan of my outfit?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze for a second before recovering, though she could feel a faint blush creeping up her neck. She tilted her head, her lips curving into a small smirk of her own. “I didn’t say that.” She paused, letting her words hang in the air. “I can definitely imagine you in a band now. It’s hard to picture it with the clothes you wear to the lab.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled, her voice low, sending an slight shiver down Agatha’s spine. “Oh, so you think I don’t dress grungy enough in the lab? Should I be wearing combat boots and ripped jeans every day? Maybe add a nose ring for good measure?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, that’s exactly what I think you should wear,” Agatha shot back, “Much more professional.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned as they started to walk toward the train. Agatha felt Rio’s gaze on her but refused to meet it, focusing instead on the rhythm of her heels clicking against the platform. When they reached the train, Agatha stepped aside, gesturing for Rio to go first. "After you," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed as Agatha met her gaze finally. "Oh, how kind." she teased, climbing aboard. She turned back to Agatha, holding her hand out with an exaggerated bow. "Your turn, m’lady."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked, momentarily stunned. She rolled her eyes as she finally took Rio’s hand and stepped onto the train, ‘You’re insufferable.’ She muttered, brushing past her to find their seats.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Admit it," Rio said as she followed. "You’d miss it if I wasn’t."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't dignify that with a response., Instead, she just continued to walk down the train car. When they reached an empty table, Agatha stepped aside, offering a hand to Rio. “Here, let me-”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ve got it,” Rio interrupted, waving her off with an easy shrug. She hoisted her duffel bag into the overhead shelf with an ease that made Agatha’s breath hitch. Agatha shook her head, trying to calm her mind and took her seat by the window, carefully placing her suitcase beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio flung herself into the seat opposite, shrugging off her leather jacket and tossing it next to her. The movement revealed a tattoo on her left shoulder. A swirling, intricate design of ivy and vines inked in delicate lines. It wasn’t large, but it drew Agatha’s attention. Her gaze lingered much longer than she intended.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're staring," Rio said suddenly, her tone teasing. Her signature smirk spread across her face as she cocked an eyebrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha startled, flicking her gaze up quickly. "I’m not," she blurted, though her voice lacked its usual steadiness. She adjusted the scarf around her neck, as though it could mask her faltering composure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled, leaning back in her seat with an air of triumph. "Wow. You almost sounded half convincing. You’re getting better at this."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, but a laugh slipped past her lips, softening her sharpness. "Fine," she admitted, tilting her head slightly as her eyes flicked back to the tattoo, this time with less hesitation. "So, when did you get that done?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk widened as she leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table between them. "Which one?" she asked, her voice playful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked. "There’s more?" She had tried not to let her surprise show, but her raised eyebrows betrayed her curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Maybe," Rio said, a teasing lilt in her voice. "Depends on how much you want to know."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed but couldn’t suppress the smile that tugged at her lips. "Let’s stick with the visible one for now," she said, gesturing toward Rio’s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head as if considering how much to reveal. "Got it when I was eighteen. Some friends and I were backpacking through Spain, and we found this tiny studio in Barcelona. The artist barely spoke English, and I was the only one of my friends who spoke Spanish." She laughed, the sound warm, and Agatha found herself leaning forward without meaning to. "I wasn’t even planning on getting a tattoo. But after translating for my friends for hours, the artist asked me if I wanted anything, so I thought.. fuck it, why not? I had been wanting this design and it just seemed like a perfect moment. It’s the only tattoo I’ve got that actually means something."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s curiosity piqued. "And what does it mean?" she asked, her tone casual, though she was keenly aware of the weight behind her question.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged, but there was a softness to her expression now, her usual bravado momentarily dimmed. "Growth. Making my mark on the world, I guess." she said simply, running her fingers lightly over the ink. "It was right after I got my Bachelor’s. I was so excited to make a difference in the field." She let out a long sigh, “Ivy grows in any conditions, it asserts itself and makes it’s mark. I wanted to remind myself that I could do the same with my research.’
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s chest tightened at the quiet sincerity in Rio’s voice. It was rare for her to see this side of her, the Rio who wasn’t always smirking or teasing, who carried something deeper beneath the surface. She didn’t know what to say, so she settled for a simple nod. "It suits you," she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s gaze snapped back to her, something unreadable flashing in her dark eyes. "Yeah?" she said as a small smile grew on her face. “Well, what about you? You hiding any tattoos?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitated for the briefest moment, her lips quirking into a coy smile. "Maybe," she said, her voice light but deliberate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyebrows shot up, her smirk morphing into something closer to genuine surprise. "Maybe?" she repeated, clearly not expecting her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That’s all you’re getting," Agatha said smoothly, sitting straighter and folding her hands in her lap as if the conversation were already over.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio narrowed her eyes, her arms and tilting her head as she studied Agatha. "Alright, now I’m intrigued. What is it? A butterfly? A little heart somewhere discreet? Or, wait-" Her grin turned wicked. "Is it something scandalous?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gave an exasperated laugh, shaking her head. "You are so dramatic."
    </p>
    <p>
     "So you
     <em>
      do
     </em>
     have one!" Rio pointed an accusing finger at her, grin widening. "Come on, you can’t just say 'maybe' and then leave me hanging. Where is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha held her ground, raising an unimpressed eyebrow. "Do you really think I’m going to tell you that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned back, folding her hands behind her head with a mock sigh. "You’re no fun. I tell you the heartfelt story behind my tattoo, and you won’t even throw me a hint.” Rio leaned forward as she continued with her overdramatic pleading, "You can’t just drop a ‘maybe’ and not at least tell me where it is."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha allowed a moment to stretch between them before meeting Rio’s gaze. "You will
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     be finding out where it is."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned back in her seat, her smirk returning in full force, but there was a new glint in her eyes, something teasing. "We’ll see about that," she said, her voice low and deliberate.
    </p>
    <p>
     The words sent a jolt through Agatha, and for a second, her thoughts raced. The ease of Rio’s confidence, the implication in her tone was maddening, unsettling, and yet... thrilling. Images she didn’t dare entertain flitted through her mind, and she had to force herself to look out the window to regain her composure. She focused on the passing scenery outside the window as if it could ground her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Confident as always," Agatha said finally, managing to keep her voice steady, though her fingers fidgeted with the edge of her scarf.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat back again, clearly pleased with herself. "It’s one of my best qualities," she said with a wink.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed softly, shaking her head. "And humility is right up there with it, I assume?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Naturally," Rio quipped, her grin unrepentant.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stole a quick glance at Rio, who was now leaning back in her seat with an air of victory. For all her overconfidence, there was something disarming about her. Agatha hated how easily she found herself drawn in, and how much she didn’t hate it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     The train continued to rumble along, the scenery outside blurring into shades of green and gold, but Agatha barely noticed. Her thoughts kept circling back to Rio’s words, her tone, the way her dark eyes seemed to catch every flicker of emotion Agatha tried to suppress. It was going to be a long two days.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a while, the world outside the train began to shift, fields giving way to the tidy streets and buildings of Oxford. Agatha watched the change absently, her mind still half-focused on the conversation with Rio. The train began to slow, the hum of the engine lowering to a steady rhythm before finally stopping at the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stretched lazily, her arms reaching high above her head. The movement caused her tank top to ride up slightly, revealing a narrow strip of tanned skin between the hem and her jeans. Agatha’s eyes flicked down before she could stop herself. Heat flared in her cheeks, and she quickly looked away, pretending to adjust her scarf.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lowered her arms, catching Agatha’s fleeting movement out of the corner of her eye. A small smirk tugged at her lips, but she said nothing, grabbing her leather jacket and scarf from the seat beside her. She slung the jacket over one shoulder with practiced ease, pulling her scarf loosely around her neck. Agatha followed suit, smoothing out her coat and wrapping her scarf snugly against the chill she knew awaited them.
    </p>
    <p>
     They stepped off the train together, the crisp evening air biting at their faces. The platform was busy but not overwhelmingly so, a mix of students, tourists, and the occasional professional briskly moving through the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they exited the station, the city opened up before them in all its postcard-perfect charm. The streets were lined with townhouses and cobblestones that glistened faintly from recent rain. Agatha’s gaze lingered on the quaint facades of the houses, lit by orange street lamps in the darkness of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
     They walked in comfortable silence for a while, their footsteps falling in sync as they navigated the narrow pavements. The occasional breeze stirred fallen leaves, and Agatha took a moment to appreciate the serenity of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have you spent much time in Oxford?” Rio’s voice broke the silence, light but curious. Agatha glanced at her, there was genuine interest in her expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I did my master’s at Oxford, so yes,” Agatha replied. “I was up here for a few years. I didn’t love it, to be honest. There’s not much going on compared to London.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head. “Huh. So you must know a few people at the Uni, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded, tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear. “Most of the neuroscience faculty, yes. Though the lab we’re visiting is new, so I don’t know anyone there. Still, it’ll be nice to catch up with some old friends. I’m meeting a woman I studied with for breakfast tomorrow, actually.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stopped in her tracks, placing a hand dramatically over her chest, her expression dramatically wounded. “So you’re deserting me? Wow, Dr. Harkness, I’m crushed. And here I thought we were bonding.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, though she couldn’t suppress the small smile tugging at her lips. “It’s breakfast, Rio. You’ll survive an hour or two without me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Will I, though?” Rio replied, her voice dripping with exaggerated despair. “I mean, what will I do?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You seem perfectly capable of entertaining yourself,” Agatha said dryly, though her tone was more amused than cutting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grin widened. “True, but it’s more fun with you around. You keep me on my toes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt warmth rise in her cheeks and turned her attention back to the street ahead. “I’m sure you’ll manage just fine,” she said briskly, trying to shake the strange fluttering in her chest. She quickened her pace slightly, hoping Rio wouldn’t notice the faint pink blooming on her face.
     <em>
      Stop it, Agatha.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The quaint hotel finally came into view, its warm light spilling onto the cobblestone street. Agatha pushed open the door, holding it for Rio before stepping inside. The faint hum of conversation mixed with the sound of a crackling fireplace. Striding up to the front desk, she offered the receptionist a polite but clipped smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re checking in. It’s under
     <em>
      Harkness.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman behind the desk nodded cheerfully. “Perfect, just a second,” she said, her fingers flying across the keyboard. After a moment, she reached under the counter and handed Agatha a single key card with a pleasant smile. “Here you are!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha frowned slightly but said nothing at first. Turning to hand the key to Rio, who was leaning casually against her suitcase with a smirk already forming, Agatha glanced back toward the receptionist, expecting another key to follow. Instead, she had already turned her attention to another guest, speaking with animated cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s brow furrowed. “Excuse me, ma’am,” she said, her tone sharp enough to catch the woman’s attention again. “Where is our other room key?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The receptionist raised an eyebrow at her, smile still wide. “Oh, did you want two keys for the room?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stared, blinking back at her in bewilderment. “What do you mean ‘room,’ singular?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman hesitated, looking back at her screen. “You’re down for one room with two queen beds. Is that not correct?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Behind her, Agatha heard the unmistakable sound of Rio snickering. She didn’t bother turning around, instead hissing through gritted teeth, “Please shut up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s laughter only grew more amused, but Agatha ignored it, turning her full attention back to the receptionist. Her lips pressed into a thin line as she crossed her arms over her chest, the stance both calculated and reflexive.
     <em>
      What the hell was this incompetence?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No…
     <em>
      Jocelyn
     </em>
     ,” Agatha said, reading the name off the badge on her shirt, her voice dripping with irritation. She leaned slightly forward, tone sharpening, “That is
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     correct.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jocelyn visibly shrank under Agatha’s glare. “I- I’m so sorry, Miss Harkness-”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Dr.
     </em>
     Harkness,” Agatha snapped, cutting her off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio snorted behind her, the sound low and unrepentant. Jocelyn looked like she wanted the floor to swallow her whole, but Agatha wasn’t about to let up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dr. Harkness,” Jocelyn corrected hurriedly, her voice trembling slightly. “I really do apologise, but we’re fully booked. There’s nothing I can do!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, rolling her eyes so hard it was a wonder they didn’t disappear into the back of her head. She glared at Jocelyn one last time, enough to leave the poor woman trembling, and then spun on her heel, striding briskly toward the lift.
    </p>
    <p>
     Behind her, Rio’s soft laughter followed like a shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You are enjoying this far too much,” Agatha said, throwing a pointed glare over her shoulder as the elevator doors slid open.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grin widened as she tugged her bag along and stepped into the lift behind Agatha, the doors sliding shut. “Oh, immensely.” Rio replied, her voice buzzing with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned her gaze forward, resolutely ignoring Rio who leaned against the wall, her laughter simmering into a smirk that Agatha refused to acknowledge. “Don’t even start,” Agatha said, raising a finger as Rio opened her mouth. Her tone was cutting, her eyes narrowed. “I do
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     want to hear whatever smart-ass comment you feel is necessary in this moment.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio feigned an offended gasp, her hand pressed dramatically to her chest. “Wow. You think so little of me,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned to meet her gaze, expecting another sarcastic quip. But Rio’s expression had shifted, her smirk morphing into something far more dangerous. She was leaning casually against the wall, her jacket slipping off one shoulder to reveal the edge of her tattoo on her collarbone. Her hair was slightly tousled from the wind, and her dark eyes gleamed with mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha swallowed hard, forcing herself to look back at the elevator doors.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was simply going to point out that I’m sure you can manage being a few meters away from me for two days…” Rio continued, pushing off the wall and closing the space between them in one measured step. Agatha was forced to meet her gaze again as her voice dipped lower, intimate and deliberate. “…I mean, given you had your tongue down my throat just last night,
     <em>
      Agatha.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched. Her chest tightened, her face heating with a mix of fury and something far more unwelcome. She opened her mouth to respond, but no words came, her sharp wit momentarily silenced by the audacity of the woman standing too close, looking too smug, and speaking too softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      How dare she.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s jaw tightened, her eyes narrowing at Rio as the elevator hummed softly around them. The air between them felt stifling, charged, and unbearably intimate. Agatha straightened her posture, pulling herself out of the gravitational pull Rio seemed to radiate effortlessly. She refused to let her composure slip further, but even now, she could feel the heat in her chest, the remnants of last night that still clung to her like a second skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That was a slip,” Agatha said firmly, her voice steady despite the rush of heat on her skin. The doors of the lift chimed and opened, and Agatha stepped out quickly, striding down the hallway with more purpose than she actually felt. She hoped her confidence would mask the lingering chaos inside her. “It was a lapse in-”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A lapse in judgment, yes, we’ve been over this,” Rio’s voice called from behind her. “It’s getting old.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s pace faltered for a moment, but she caught herself, determined not to show any weakness. She reached the door to their room and turned with a swift motion to face Rio. “Well, it’s true. It
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     a lapse in judgment,” Agatha shot back, her words sharp but controlled. She held Rio’s gaze with an intensity she hoped would ward off any further teasing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grin deepened, her posture relaxed as she leaned a hand on the wall beside the door, her body angled toward Agatha in an infuriatingly casual way. Her voice was low, almost teasing. “Okay. I’m not arguing with that. Just… curious as to when your judgment might lapse again?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath caught at the implication, her chest tightening. She scoffed, turning the key in the door with unnecessary force. "It won’t," she said, almost too quickly, as she stepped into the room, not sparing Rio another glance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio followed her inside, and Agatha heard the soft rustle of her suitcase hitting the floor behind her. Agatha turned to face the room, but her gaze shifted involuntarily Rio. Agatha’s coughed, making her voice as cold as she could manage, the last thread of her patience unraveling. “Just stay on your side of this room, and everything will be fine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed dramatically, flopping down on the bed furthest from the door, her body sprawling out with complete ease. “Mm-hmm. Whatever you want to believe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t respond, instead moving toward her own bed, keeping her distance. But before she could fully retreat, Rio propped herself up on one elbow, her smirk widening. She laughed to herself, clearly amused, then leaned toward Agatha with exaggerated theatrics. “But I’d give it three hours at most before you jump me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze, the words hitting her like a punch to the stomach. She stared at Rio, speechless for a moment, and then quickly turned away, though her heart thudded painfully in her chest. She couldn’t believe what Rio was saying, couldn’t believe how casually she was making her feel so exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio continued, her voice low and mocking. “Can you at least give me a little more warning before you slam me into a wall this time? Maybe I should wear a back brace or something. I mean, you could seriously damage my spine, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, trying to ignore the flutter of frustration mixed with something else… something far more dangerous. She crossed her arms over her chest, standing tall even though her insides were boiling. She refused to let Rio get to her, the words that escaped her were sharp and deliberate. “Someone’s getting very comfortable using my first name. You really think you should address your teacher like that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow, as though daring Agatha to go further. “You really think
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     can comment on
     <em>
      my
     </em>
     professionalism, after pinning me to a fucking wall for God knows how long last night?” she shot back with a laugh, leaning back against the headboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     The audacity. Agatha’s face flushed with both anger and embarrassment, her body stiffening at the reminder of last night. She knew it had been a moment of weakness she shouldn’t entertain, but the memory of Rio’s lips against hers still lingered like a shadow. The idea of admitting any of this aloud was unthinkable, so she said nothing. Instead, she turned away, her hands clenching into fists at her sides as she tried to focus on something, anything, other than Rio’s proximity.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tension in the room thickened as Agatha remained silent, unwilling to give Rio the satisfaction of another response. But she could feel the weight of Rio’s gaze on her, the insistent pull of her presence that made it impossible to simply forget. Rio laughed, a low, self-satisfied sound that told Agatha she was well aware of the effect she was having on her. And Agatha wasn’t sure whether she wanted to strangle her or kiss her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed and turned her attention to her suitcase, unzipping it with sharp, precise movements. "Whatever," she muttered, more to herself than to Rio. "Let’s just go to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who had been lounging on her bed, immediately sat up. “But we haven’t eaten,” she pointed out, her voice light and teasing but with a hint of genuine concern. “Come on, you must be hungry. Let’s get food. I promise I won’t be annoying.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glanced over her shoulder at her, eyebrow raised in a skeptical arch. “I highly doubt that,” she said dryly, but her stomach growled faintly, betraying her resolve. She sighed. “Fine. It’s late, though. Nothing will be open.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned triumphantly, already pulling out her phone and typing with quick, confident motions. She looked up a moment later, her eyes gleaming with excitement. “There’s a Burger King just around the corner. We could grab food there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze mid-motion, an incredulous expression creeping across her face. She turned fully to look at Rio, her arms crossed tightly over her chest. “Burger King?” she repeated, her voice laced with disdain. “No way in hell.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, a low, melodic sound, and hopped up from the bed. She crossed the room in a few quick steps, her movements light and unbothered, and grabbed Agatha’s arms with both hands. Before Agatha could protest, Rio was tugging her up, a playful energy radiating from her. “Come on, Agatha,” Rio cajoled, grinning up at her like an overeager child. “It’s all that’s open, and I’m starving. And it’s not even that bad. Don’t be a snob.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tried to hold her ground, to glare and resist the infectious energy that Rio seemed to carry everywhere with her. But the sheer enthusiasm on Rio’s face chipped away at her resolve. Agatha could feel the corners of her own mouth twitching upward despite herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     She let out a reluctant laugh, shaking her head as she finally gave in. “Fine,” she said, rolling her eyes but unable to suppress the small smile tugging at her lips. “Let’s go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whooped victoriously, already letting go of Agatha to grab her jacket. “See?” she said, throwing it on and grabbing her wallet. “You’re not so impossible after all.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head again, suppressing a chuckle as she grabbed her coat. “Don’t push your luck, Vidal,” she warned, her voice sharp but softened by the amusement that lingered in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio held the door open for her, bowing dramatically as Agatha stepped past her into the hallway. “Wouldn’t dream of it, Dr. Harkness,” Rio said, her voice dripping with playful sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they made their way out of the hotel and into the cool night air, Agatha couldn’t help but feel the weight of the tension between them lightening for a moment. Rio walked beside her, hands stuffed into her jacket pockets, her energy calmer now but no less magnetic. Agatha glanced at her out of the corner of her eye, her thoughts a swirling mix of irritation and curiosity. For someone who could drive her to the edge of her patience, Rio also had a way of disarming her in ways she hadn’t expected.

    <p>
     The park across the street from the Burger King was quiet and nearly empty, except for the rustling leaves and the faint hum of distant traffic. Agatha and Rio settled onto a bench beneath a glowing streetlamp, its warm light casting soft shadows on their faces. The smell of freshly fried food wafted between them as they unwrapped their burgers, the crinkle of paper loud in the still night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was the first to dig in, tearing into her burger eagerly. She let out a muffled groan of delight, her voice low. “Ugh, that’s fucking amazing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused mid-unwrapping, glancing over at Rio. She was entirely absorbed in her food, her expression a mix of bliss and focus as she chewed. A smile tugged at Agatha’s lips before she could stop it, a small laugh escaping her. “Slow down,” she said, shaking her head. “You’ll choke.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up at her, mouth still full, eyes wide with exaggerated innocence. “But I’m
     <em>
      hungry
     </em>
     ,” she said through her full cheeks, her voice muffled but insistent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t help but laugh again, louder this time, her head leaning back slightly as the sound bubbled out. The moment felt strange, easy, and almost too natural. Like slipping into an old habit she hadn’t known she missed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shaking her head with a faint smile, she finally took a bite of her own burger. She chewed slowly, then nodded in reluctant approval. “Oh wow, that
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, triumphant, and nudged her shoulder lightly. “See? I told you you’d like it!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The silence between them stretched comfortably for a few moments, broken only by the faint hum of the city and occasional rustle of leaves in the soft breeze. Agatha took another bite as her eyes flicked to Rio. She had finished her food and was licking her lips absentmindedly, utterly unaware of the way the streetlamp’s glow softened her features. Her hair shifted slightly in the wind, tousling just enough to make her look effortlessly beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched. A quiet, unconscious reaction she immediately cursed herself for. Rio noticed, of course. She always noticed. Her smirk appeared, a brief flash of amusement across her face before it softened into something more genuine. Her eyes lit with curiosity as she turned slightly toward Agatha. “So,” Rio began, her tone casual but tinged with mischief, “this seems like a good moment to tell me about your mysterious tattoo.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned, rolling her eyes. “Wow. Will you give it a rest?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nope.” Rio said, leaning closer and resting her chin in her hand, her smile growing. “Please?” she added, batting her lashes with an overdramatic pout.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed, setting her food wrappers down on the bench next to her. She turned back to Rio, whose expression was nothing short of childlike enthusiasm. Her leg brushed against Rio’s as she turned to face her, the contact sending a jolt through Agatha. She forced herself to focus, clearing her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You really want to know?” Agatha asked, raising an eyebrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded eagerly, her grin widening.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s really not as exciting as you think it is, Rio. I promise.” Agatha shook her head and began to unbutton the top of her shirt, her movements deliberate and composed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes widened, and she let out a laugh, surprise lacing her voice. “Wow, Agatha. I was joking when I said I’d give it three hours, but, I mean, sure, whatever you want.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cut her off with a pointed glare. “Will you
     <em>
      shut up
     </em>
     ? My clothes are not going anywhere. I’m just trying to show you the tattoo.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She undid one more button and tugged her collar down just enough to reveal the small, elegant tattoo inked across her sternum: the letter
     <em>
      N
     </em>
     in swirling, delicate blue lines.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s laughter stopped as her gaze zeroed in on the expanse of skin that was exposed. Her expression shifted, surprise melting into quiet fascination. Her eyes were wide, her focus unwavering.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cleared her throat, trying to dispel the heat building in the air between them. “Distracted, are we?” she asked dryly, drawing Rio’s attention back to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked, recovering quickly. “So, who’s
     <em>
      N
     </em>
     ?” she asked, leaning back slightly but still studying the tattoo. A gasp escaped her a moment later, her grin growing mischievous again. “Oh my God. Agatha Harkness, did you get an ex’s initial tattooed on you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a small laugh, shaking her head. “No, nothing half as scandalous.” She glanced down at the tattoo and softened, her voice quieter as she explained, “The
     <em>
      N
     </em>
     is for Nicholas, my son’s name.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio froze, her breath catching. “I didn’t know you have a son.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha met her gaze slowly, her voice dropping as she corrected, “
     <em>
      Had
     </em>
     . I had a son.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The words hung in the air, heavy and unyielding. Agatha felt tears threatening to surface, but she blinked them back, refusing to let them fall. Across from her, Rio’s face fell, her playful demeanour evaporating in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, I’m- I’m so sorry. I didn’t know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a quiet, humourless laugh, shaking her head. “Don’t be silly. Of course you didn’t. I don’t really... tell people about it. I-” She paused, her thoughts drifting back through the years.
    </p>
    <p>
     The realisation struck her like a sharp blow to the chest. She really hadn’t told anyone. Not since her mother, who had been more critical than comforting. Work colleagues had never been close enough to tell, and friends… well, she hadn’t seen most of her old friends for years. The most defining moment of her life, her deepest wound, and no one but her mother knew. It had loomed over her like a shadow every day for the last five years and… somehow she had not told a single person.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked and met Rio’s gaze again, her voice tinged with disbelief. “Come to think of it, I don’t think I’ve told
     <em>
      anyone
     </em>
     about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s expression softened even further, her brows lifting in concern. For a moment, the memory’s weight felt lighter, as if Rio’s quiet presence could ease the ache.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What... what happened?” Rio asked gently, her voice tentative yet filled with genuine care. “I mean, only if you want to talk about it. I just- I think it might be good for you, you know? To talk to someone.” She shrugged, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s heart twisted at the tenderness in Rio’s gaze. She let out a long sigh and began to close her shirt, turning away slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was about five years ago,” she said softly, her voice steady despite the tightness in her throat. “He was very sick. There was nothing we could have done, I knew that when he was born. The doctors gave him a year to live, and somehow, he managed six. He was never supposed to live that long. It was a blessing, honestly.” She paused, her fingers trembling slightly as she fastened the last button. “But...”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her voice cracked, and she swallowed hard, forcing herself to continue. “Still, the fact that it was a miracle he even lived to six doesn’t make it any less painful.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stared down at her lap, blinking rapidly in a futile attempt to keep the tears at bay. She wouldn’t look at Rio. Not now, not when the vulnerability she worked so hard to bury was threatening to spill out. She’d already let her guard down far too much around this woman. To let Rio see her cry would be the final blow to her pride.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then, she felt it. A soft, deliberate touch. Rio’s hand gently brushed a stray strand of hair from Agatha’s face, her fingertips light and careful. Agatha’s head lifted almost involuntarily, her watery gaze meeting Rio’s. Her heart stuttered at the look she found there. Rio’s expression was unguarded, full of tenderness and understanding. For a moment, Agatha forgot how to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t pull her hand away. When the tear Agatha had been fighting against escaped, sliding silently down her cheek, Rio’s fingers moved to her face, brushing the tear away with an intimacy that made Agatha’s chest ache.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s okay.” Rio whispered, her voice impossibly soft.
    </p>
    <p>
     A quiet laugh escaped Agatha as she glanced down again, shaking her head. “This is so pathetic, I’m sorry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lowered her hand then, but instead of retreating, she reached for Agatha’s. Her fingers closed over Agatha’s own, warm and steady, grounding her. She gave Agatha’s hand a gentle squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s not pathetic,” Rio said firmly. “And you know that, Agatha. You’re not stupid.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes flicked back to Rio, startled by the intensity in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grip on her hand tightened slightly, her thumb beginning to rub soothing circles over the back of Agatha’s hand. Her gaze didn’t waver as she continued, “I know what you’re doing. You’re trying to regain control because you feel like you’re losing it right now. But you don’t have to. Not with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The words settled over Agatha, simultaneously disarming and terrifying.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s voice softened, her tone almost coaxing. “You don’t have to put on this facade around me if you don’t want to. You can be that badass, incredible scientist at work, but also let go of power sometimes. You need balance. You can’t be
     <em>
      on
     </em>
     all the time, Agatha. It’s exhausting.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched, her chest tightening as she absorbed Rio’s words. She felt exposed in a way she never had before, stripped bare in front of someone who seemed to see past every defence she had so carefully built.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And,” Rio continued, her thumb still tracing along Agatha’s hand, “you can hand over control from time to time, you know. You may even find you like it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The implication in her tone was unmistakable. Agatha felt her heart stutter. Her lips parted, a retort forming on her tongue, but the weight of Rio’s hand on hers and the openness in her expression stopped her. She swallowed hard, her mind racing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I...” Agatha started, her voice faltering.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s okay,” Rio said again, softer this time, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s. “Take your time. I’m not going anywhere.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And for the first time in a very long time, Agatha believed someone when they said those words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced at their intertwined hands, then back up at Agatha, her lips curling into a soft smile. “We should head back to the hotel,” she said gently, her voice breaking the quiet intimacy between them without shattering it completely. “It’s late.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded, pulling her hand back carefully, the absence of Rio’s touch leaving her skin cold. Rio stood first, her movements slow, as though unwilling to disrupt the moment entirely. Agatha followed, smoothing her coat before stepping away from the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
     The walk back to the hotel began in a comfortable silence, the kind that didn’t demand filling. The cool night air brushed against them, the soft glow of the city lights reflecting off the damp cobblestones. Agatha tucked her hands into her pockets, her thoughts swirling quietly. It was unusual to feel this calm in someone else’s presence. With Rio, there was no need to fill the quiet with meaningless chatter, and for once, Agatha appreciated the reprieve from her own overthinking.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then, just as they passed under the arch of an old lamppost, Rio let out a soft chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned her head, raising an eyebrow at her companion. “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s lips twitched into a grin, her eyes glinting with amusement. “I was just picturing you as a master’s student here in Oxford,” she said, her voice warm with teasing. “Walking this same path home after a night out.'
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorted, shaking her head. “You're idiotic.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Unless…” Rio gave her a sideways glance, her grin growing. “You didn’t go out, did you? Just stayed in your room all night, pouring over textbooks and making notes?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha placed a hand on her chest in mock offense. “I’m wounded at how much of a loser you seem to think I am.” She laughed, the sound unexpectedly light in the quiet of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stopped too, turning to face her fully, clearly enjoying herself. “Am I wrong, though? Did you even have a social life back then, or was your idea of a wild time reorganising your planner?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, though she couldn’t help the small smile tugging at her lips. “I’ll have you know I
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     go out while I was here. The whole ‘wicked witch of neuro’ persona didn’t start until much later.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah, so you weren’t always terrifying,” Rio said with mock relief, walking ahead a few steps before turning to face Agatha again, her hands tucked into her jacket pockets. “Tell me, what was wild-child Agatha like? Did she have an edgy haircut? Get kicked out of pubs for yelling at people who didn’t know the difference between neuroscience and psychology?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hardly,” Agatha said with a laugh, falling into step beside her. “But I might have had a rebellious phase or two. You don’t get to be the best without blowing off steam every once in a while.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow. “Define ‘rebellious.’ Please tell me it involves something scandalous.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gave her a knowing look, her lips curling in a smirk. “Wouldn’t you like to know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I
     <em>
      definitely
     </em>
     would,” Rio shot back, grinning. “I can’t imagine you as anything but-”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Terrifying?” Agatha cut in with a playful tilt of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Focused,” Rio corrected, though her tone was just as teasing. “Maybe a little terrifying.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed again, the sound ringing out into the night, surprising even herself with how easy it felt. As they reached the corner of the street that led to their hotel, Rio bumped her shoulder lightly against Agatha’s, the contact brief but warm. “I’m starting to think I’ve underestimated you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good,” Agatha said smoothly, her smirk returning. “Keeps you on your toes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They lapsed into silence again, but this it was light, warm. The kind of quiet that felt like a conversation in itself. As the hotel drew closer, Agatha couldn’t help but think about how Rio had slipped into her life so seamlessly, stirring up emotions she hadn’t felt in years.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they reached the hotel, the silence followed them into the elevator. Rio leaned casually against the wall, her hands shoved into the pockets of her leather jacket, her expression unreadable. Agatha could feel the weight of her presence, every stolen glance in the reflective walls amplified in the stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time they made it to their floor, the tension was so thick you could cut it with a knife. Agatha walked ahead, pulling out the keycard as they reached their door. She swiped it once. The red light blinked. Twice. Red again. She shook her head as she tried a third time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Need a hand?” Rio asked, her voice warm and tinged with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ve got it,” Agatha snapped, though her voice lacked its usual bite.
    </p>
    <p>
     She finally got the door open and stepped inside, flicking on the light as she did. The room was just as they’d left it: two queen beds, one pristine, the other in disarray from Rio’s earlier sprawl. Agatha headed straight for her suitcase, a feeble attempt to distract herself by unpacking her toiletries.
    </p>
    <p>
     The door shut softly behind her, followed by the unmistakable click of the lock sliding into place. Agatha stiffened. She turned, her eyes meeting Rio’s. The other woman leaned against the doorframe, her hands still tucked in her jacket pockets, her dark eyes holding an intensity that made Agatha’s stomach flip.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” Agatha demanded, more defensive than she intended. “Something on your mind, Rio?” Agatha asked, her tone sharp out of habit, though the edges softened in the intimacy of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head, a faint smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. She took a step forward, her movements unhurried but deliberate. “Yeah,” she said, her voice low, “You.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath caught. Rio was close now, so close that the faint scent citrus filled the air between them. She didn’t move as Rio reached up, her fingers brushing Agatha’s cheek with a gentleness that felt utterly at odds with the tension simmering in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha opened her mouth, the words tumbling out before she could stop them. “Rio, I shouldn’t be doing this again... I can’t...” Her voice wavered, but she held Rio’s gaze, her chest tightening with the weight of the confession.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s expression softened, her dark eyes searching Agatha’s face, but she didn’t step back. Instead, she tilted her head, her brows lifting in a calm, almost teasing challenge. “So tell me to stop.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked, momentarily stunned by the simplicity of the statement, the steady resolve in her voice. Rio took a small step closer, her voice lower now, but no less firm. “Tell me to step away, and I will. Just say the word.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha opened her mouth again, but no sound came. Her heart thundered in her chest, every nerve alive with tension. This was dangerous territory, and her instinct to pull away screamed loud and insistent. Her rational mind screamed at her to push Rio away, to regain control of the moment, but her body betrayed her. She couldn’t bring herself to say it, to tell Rio to stop. Not when the air between them felt charged with something she hadn’t let herself feel in years.
    </p>
    <p>
     So instead, she let out a shaky breath. “Don’t..” she managed to murmur. At that, Rio closed the space between them, her lips meeting Agatha’s in a kiss that was both confident and tender.
    </p>
    <p>
     The world tilted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze at first, her body going rigid as her mind scrambled for purchase. But then Rio’s thumb stroked her cheek, grounding her in a way that silenced the chaos in her mind. Slowly, she melted, her hands hesitantly finding their way to Rio’s waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     The kiss deepened, and with it, Agatha felt herself unravel. Rio’s lips were firm, her touch careful but insistent. Every thought, every defence Agatha had built over the years, crumbled in the wake of Rio’s unwavering certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stepped closer, her body brushing against Agatha’s in a way that sent heat spiralling through her. Rio’s gaze held Agatha’s, intense and unrelenting as she stepped into her space. Without breaking eye contact, she shrugged off her leather jacket, the motion fluid and deliberate. The soft thud of the jacket hitting the floor seemed to echo in the charged air between them. Now standing bare-armed, her movements deliberate, Rio reached out, her hands steady as they settled on Agatha’s arms. She guided her to sit on the edge of the bed with a pressure that was firm but not forceful, leaving no room for doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” Agatha started, her voice barely above a whisper, but the other woman was already leaning in. “What are you-”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio silenced her with a finger pressed gently against her lips, her dark eyes locking onto Agatha’s with a mix of amusement and unmistakable intensity. “Agatha,” she said softly, her tone steady but firm, “remember what I said earlier… you don’t always have to be in control.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The words hung in the air, heavy and deliberate, as Rio let her finger trail away, brushing along Agatha’s jaw before she leaned in closer. Her breath was warm against Agatha’s ear as she whispered, her voice dropping to a low, teasing murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You might find you like handing over power... in certain situations.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shivered at the words, her pulse racing as Rio pulled back just enough to look into her eyes, a small, knowing smirk tugging at her lips before she leaned in to kiss her again. It was intense and commanding, Rio’s lips moving against hers with a purpose that stole the air from Agatha’s lungs. The taste of her mixed with the pressure of the kiss as Rio deepened it, tilting her head to push further, leaving no space for second-guessing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gasped softly, her hands gripping at Rio’s hips before instinctively tugging at the hem of her shirt. Rio pulled back just enough to smirk down at her, then straightened. Without a word, she grabbed the hem of her own shirt, pulling it over her head in one swift motion. The movement left her hair tousled and her toned shoulders and collarbones on full display, her confidence radiating in every motion.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re staring,” Rio teased, her voice low, but the heat in her eyes betrayed her own intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha swallowed hard, but any retort she might have made died on her lips as Rio reached for her. With sure hands, Rio slipped her fingers under the hem of Agatha’s shirt, her knuckles brushing against warm skin as she tugged the fabric up. Agatha hesitated for a fraction of a second before lifting her arms, letting Rio pull the shirt off entirely and toss it to the side.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment lingered, their breathing heavy, the air between them thick with anticipation. Rio leaned back in, her lips finding Agatha’s again, this time with even more intensity, the kiss fuelled by the charged electricity of their exposed skin brushing together. Agatha clutched at Rio’s bare shoulders, her nails biting into the smooth muscle as Rio’s hands slid down her sides, steadying her as she leaned in deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
     With an insistent push, Rio eased Agatha back onto the mattress, her own body following fluidly. The weight of Rio above her, her toned arms bracing against the bed as her dark eyes roamed over Agatha’s now-exposed form, was almost too much to bear. But before Agatha could lose herself in the moment, Rio kissed her again. Harder, deeper, and with a certainty that left no room for doubt about what she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     The kiss deepened, Rio's body pressing closer against Agatha’s, their exposed skin brushing in a way that sent waves of heat through both of them. Rio braced herself with one arm beside Agatha’s head, her other hand skimming down from Agatha’s shoulder, tracing the curve of her side with deliberate, featherlight touches that made Agatha’s breath hitch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s fingers clutched at Rio’s waist, her nails digging into the firm muscles just above her hips as if to steady herself against the onslaught of sensations. Rio pulled back slightly, just enough to hover above her, her lips swollen from the kiss and her eyes locked on Agatha’s with an intensity that left her feeling exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You okay?” Rio asked, her voice low and raspy, the words roughened by the proximity and the tension crackling in the air between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded, her throat tight, her breathing unsteady. “Yeah,” she managed, her voice barely above a whisper. “I’m good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s lips quirked into the faintest of smiles, but it wasn’t teasing like before. It was softer, more genuine, though no less confident. “Good,” she murmured, and before Agatha could say anything else, Rio dipped her head again, her mouth finding the curve of Agatha’s jaw. She pressed slow, deliberate kisses down the column of her throat, each one sending a fresh shiver coursing through Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s head tilted back instinctively, her hands sliding up Rio’s back, as a small moan escaped her. Rio chuckled softly against her neck, her lips curving against Agatha’s skin. Her hand slid lower, her fingers brushing over the bare skin of Agatha’s waist, her touch both steadying and tantalisingly slow.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment stretched between them, each movement deliberate and measured, as if Rio wanted to give Agatha every chance to stop her. But Agatha didn’t pull away. Instead, she leaned into it, her hands finding their way to Rio’s hair, threading through the soft strands as she tugged her back up into another kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     This one was hungrier, more desperate, Agatha’s body arching into Rio’s as if trying to close the space between them entirely. Rio responded in kind, her hands sliding to Agatha’s hips, her grip tightening as she held her steady. The kiss grew heated, their breathing mingling, their shared urgency building with every second.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio pulled back again, her forehead resting against Agatha’s, she was smirking, that same infuriatingly self-assured expression that never failed to get under Agatha’s skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smile softened, and for a moment, the charged atmosphere between them stilled. She reached up, brushing a strand of hair out of Agatha’s face, her touch lingering. “You’re a piece of work, you know that?” she murmured, her voice quieter now, but no less sure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha arched a brow, the corner of her mouth quirking upward. “Takes one to know one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, low and throaty, before leaning in to kiss her again, her movements slower this time, more deliberate. It wasn’t just a kiss; it was a statement, a promise, and Agatha gave herself over to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kissed her deeper, her hands moving with purpose, tracing Agatha’s jawline before sliding down to her neck, then her shoulders. Agatha could feel her pulse quicken with each passing second, the tension between them almost unbearable. Rio’s lips pulled away for just a moment, a breath of space between them, but her dark eyes never left Agatha’s, their intensity as undeniable as the pull between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s heart raced, her mind still reeling from the heat of the kiss, the way Rio’s touch felt like it was setting her skin on fire. But there was something in Rio’s eyes , that made Agatha’s chest tighten. For a moment, she wasn’t sure if she should speak, if she should try to put the thoughts swirling in her mind into words. But then she realised she didn’t need to. She didn’t need to say anything at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, she leaned in again, closing the distance between them with a quiet intensity, kissing Rio slowly at first, as though to savour the moment, the shift in their connection. Her hands found their way to the small of Rio’s back, pulling her closer, deeper, as if she couldn’t get enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a soft sound against her lips, a low hum of approval, and that was all the answer Rio needed. The kiss grew more urgent, more desperate, both of them moving in sync, caught in the pull that had been building ever since they first locked eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re incredible,” Rio murmured, her voice thick with desire, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s skin, tracing the lines of her collarbone, down her ribs, each touch like a spark igniting her. Agatha’s heart thudded in her chest, her body pressed into the mattress as Rio leaned down, her mouth tracing a path along her neck, her breath hot and insistent. It was all too much, too fast, but at the same time, it wasn’t nearly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not the one in control here,” Agatha murmured, her voice strained but teasing, as Rio’s lips continued their slow exploration down her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked, her eyes glinting as she lifted her head to meet Agatha’s gaze. “Oh, so you’ve finally accepted that, have you?” she asked, her voice soft but full of the teasing edge that Agatha had come to recognise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha opened her mouth to reply, but before she could, Rio kissed her again, silencing her with the intensity of it. Their bodies pressed closer together, the kiss deepening, and everything else, every moment of doubt, faded away. The room was thick with heat, the air heavy with unspoken desire, and Agatha could feel every inch of her skin prickling with anticipation. Rio’s hands were everywhere, each touch sending jolts of electricity through her body, igniting something deep inside her. Agatha’s breath was coming faster now, her pulse hammering in her ears, but she couldn’t seem to get enough of the closeness, of the way Rio’s mouth moved against hers, slow and teasing one moment, urgent the next.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s fingers moved down to the waistband of Agatha’s trousers, toying with the hem as she pulled back slightly from the kiss. Her forehead rested against Agatha’s, their breath mingling, both of them panting. She met Agatha’s gaze, her eyes dark with want, a flicker of something deeper in them, something that was both comforting and overwhelming at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you sure about this?” Rio’s voice was a soft whisper, but the question hung in the air, louder than any words they’d said before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t have to think for long. She nodded, her hands finding their way to Rio’s shoulders, pulling her back in with a quiet urgency. “Yes,” she breathed, her voice hushed but certain, “I’m sure.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A slow, deliberate smile curled on Rio’s lips. She kissed Agatha again, gentler this time, as if savouring the moment, before her lips trailed down to her neck, her hands starting to unbutton Agatha’s trousers at a tantalisingly slow pace
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath caught as Rio’s lips moved lower, the air around them thick with tension, each second stretching on, both of them balancing on the edge of something neither of them wanted to rush. There was a stillness between their movements, a shared understanding of what was coming, but neither of them seemed eager to break the delicate silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then Rio paused, looking up at Agatha, her eyes searching, as if asking for permission, and Agatha’s chest tightened. For once, she didn’t need to say a word. It was all there in the look they shared, in the way their bodies seemed to gravitate toward each other as if they’d been waiting for this moment without even realising it.

    <p>
     Agatha woke slowly, soft golden light spilling into the room and painting the walls in warm hues. The first thing she noticed was the faint hum of the morning outside, the chirp of birds and the distant sound of life stirring awake. She blinked groggily, her vision swimming as she tried to make sense of her surroundings. This wasn’t her bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she shifted slightly, she felt warmth. Solid, gentle warmth, close against her side. Her heart gave a jolt as she flicked her eyes to her right. Oh shit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who she had sworn to remain professional around. Rio, who had a knack for getting under her skin in ways that both frustrated and intrigued her, was currently lying next to her, one arm draped casually over her shoulders, holding her close. Agatha froze, her head resting against Rio’s chest, rising and falling with each slow, steady breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     And damn if Rio didn’t look breathtaking. The glow of the sunrise illuminated her face, highlighting her sharp cheekbones and and the gentle arch of her lips. Her dark hair was an untamed mess, strands splayed across the pillow. Her expression, for once, was utterly relaxed. No infuriating smirk tugging at her lips, no sharp retorts poised to fly off her tongue. Just calm. It was strange,
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     strange, for Agatha to see her like this. Beautiful in a way Agatha wasn’t used to, a way that made her heart do something odd and fluttery.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath caught, and for a moment, she simply stared, unable to think, unable to move. Every instinct told her to untangle herself from Rio’s arm and put some distance between them, but her body betrayed her. Her gaze lingered, tracing the curve of Rio’s lips, the way her freckles seemed to glow faintly in the morning light. She barely noticed the pounding of her own heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Rio stirred. Her brow furrowed as she scrunched her face against the sunlight, a low groan escaping her lips. Her nose wrinkled slightly, and she opened one eye, squinting at the world. She finally blinked both her eyes open. Agatha tensed as those dark brown eyes, still heavy with sleep, shifted to meet hers. For a split second, Rio looked startled, her gaze widening slightly as if she couldn’t quite believe what she was seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the moment didn’t last long. Agatha watched as the memory of last night seemed to click into place and, of course, that smirk began to tug at her lips, though it lacked its usual bite. It was softer, playful, a teasing light glinting in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Morning, sunshine,” Rio drawled, her voice low and still a little rough.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt heat rush to her cheeks. She knew she should say something, should try to salvage the situation, but her brain was moving sluggishly. She swallowed hard, her voice coming out hoarse as she finally managed to croak, “Shut up, don’t call me that.’ But her tone softened with a smile as she added, “Good morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sat up slowly, her muscles stiff, her mind sluggish as she tried to shake off the lingering haze of sleep. Her fingers dragged across her face as she rubbed at her eyes, willing herself to regain composure. Beside her, Rio shifted, and Agatha could feel the other woman’s gaze on her even without looking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sleep well?” Rio asked, her tone light.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t trust her voice to come out steady, so she kept her response short. “Mm-hmm.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her own voice sounded small, and she hated how aware she was of every little thing. Her tangled hair, the crinkle of the blanket against her lap, and, most of all, the weight of Rio’s eyes on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You passed out in, like, seconds,” Rio added, her tone teasing, the faintest trace of amusement curling her words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha finally glared over at her, only to catch the smirk she knew would be waiting there. Rio’s messy hair framed her face in a way that looked infuriatingly perfect, her dark eyes bright despite the early hour. Agatha swallowed hard and muttered, “Don’t start.”
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio wasn’t one to let things go so easily. “No, I’m just saying,” she pressed, lifting her hands in mock innocence. “You seemed worn out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The comment sent a flush of heat straight to Agatha’s cheeks, though she fought to keep her expression neutral. “Must you insist on making everything ten times harder than it needs to be?” she snapped, though the edge in her voice was dulled by the faint twitch of her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.” Rio replied immediately, her smirk widening.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a sigh Agatha turned her attention to the rumpled blanket on her lap, fussing with it as though the answer to her turmoil might be hidden in its folds. A heavy silence followed, stretching out between them like a taut wire.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Agatha spoke, her voice quieter this time, though no less resolute. “Last night was an accident.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her words hung in the air, heavy and deliberate, as she risked a glance at Rio. For a split second, the smirk faltered. It was brief, and just as quickly, Rio masked it with a grin that didn’t quite reach her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “An accident, hmm?” Rio echoed, tilting her head, her voice laced with a teasing edge. “And here I thought the denial might be over.” Her attempt to brush it off was so
     <em>
      Rio,
     </em>
     all sharp edges and deflection, but Agatha saw the vulnerability lurking beneath the surface, and despite herself, felt a pang of guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Agatha could respond, Rio continued, her voice softening slightly. “Look, I know it was an accident, but…” She trailed off.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But what?” Agatha pressed, turning fully to face her now. Her eyes searched Rio’s face, trying to decipher the mix of emotions there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hesitated, her gaze dropping to the blanket for a moment before meeting Agatha’s again. “It was nice,” she admitted, her voice quieter now. “Last night, waking up like that. It was nice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt a twist in her chest, like her heart had clenched and refused to let go. The honesty in Rio’s voice was disarming. For all her smirks and quips, there was a vulnerability in her now that Agatha wasn’t sure she’d ever seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was nice…” Agatha found herself saying before she could stop. Her voice was barely above a whisper, her lips curving into a faint, unguarded smile. Her gaze met Rio’s again, and this time, she let it linger. The intensity in Rio’s eyes was enough to make her breath hitch, enough to make the rest of the world fade into the background. For a moment, she forgot where she was or why she had tried so hard to keep this wall between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     But reality crept back in, and Agatha forced herself to clear her throat, straightening as if to reestablish some semblance of distance. “But it was an accident,” she added, her tone firmer this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s expression shifted, her face carefully neutral, though Agatha caught the fleeting flash of dejection in her eyes. It was there and gone in an instant, but it was enough to make Agatha’s chest tighten. “Yeah. Of course.” Rio said, nodding. Her voice was casual, her lips pulling into a smile that tried to mirror her usual confidence but didn’t quite make it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s stomach twisted at the sight of it, guilt mingling with something deeper and more complicated. She wanted to reach out, to say something to soften the blow, but the words wouldn’t come. Instead, the two of them sat in a silence that felt heavier than it should have, the unspoken things between them lingering like a storm waiting to break.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a long sigh, running her fingers through her matted hair in an attempt to detangle the knots. The frustration mounting inside her was palpable, and all she wanted was to get through this morning without further embarrassment. She swung her legs off the side of the bed, intending to stand, but the second she did, a horrifying realisation hit.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn’t wearing any clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes widened, a flush rising to her cheeks as she froze. Slowly, she turned her head back to Rio, who was still lounging against the pillows, watching her with an amused gleam in her eyes. She let out a low whistle, her grin downright wicked. Agatha clenched her jaw, deciding that letting Rio get under her skin would only make things worse. Instead, she straightened her posture, dropped her arms to her sides, and put her hands on her hips. Her expression shifted into one of calm defiance as she said, “Go ahead. Take a long look while it lasts.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grin grew impossibly wider, though Agatha didn’t miss the way her dark eyes roamed slowly over her body. When Rio’s gaze met hers again, there was something unmistakable in it, something that made Agatha’s stomach flip.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, sure,” Rio said, her voice dripping with mock seriousness. “Because this is the ‘
     <em>
      very last time
     </em>
     ’ I’ll ever see this.” She made exaggerated air quotes around the words, her tone a mix of teasing and smugness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. “You’re insufferable.” she muttered, grabbing the first articles of clothing she could find. She shrugged on a pair of underwear and tugged on some black trousers, doing her best to maintain her composure. Grabbing her phone from the bedside table, she glanced at the time and let out a sharp gasp. “Fuck, I’m already late!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shifted lazily on the bed, propping herself up on one elbow as she watched Agatha rush around the room. “Late for what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused to glance back at her while fastening her bra. “I told you yesterday, remember? I’m meeting an old friend for breakfast.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded but said nothing as Agatha continued her frantic preparations. She darted into the bathroom, squeezing toothpaste onto her toothbrush as she called back over her shoulder, “I should be back well before we need to go in for the lecture, and then-”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her words cut off abruptly as her gaze landed on her reflection in the bathroom mirror. Her eyes widened in horror as she took in the marks scattered across her neck and collarbones, various shades of deep reds and purples standing out starkly against her pale skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,
     <em>
      what the fuck?!
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stormed out of the bathroom, her toothbrush still in hand, and came to a stop at the foot of the bed, glaring daggers at Rio, who looked far too pleased with herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned back, folding her hands behind her head, her smirk growing. “Hmm? Something wrong?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gestured wildly to her neck, her voice sharp and incredulous. “What the hell did you do to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s gaze flicked to the marks with no attempt to hide her satisfaction. She snickered, raising an eyebrow. “You didn’t seem to mind last night. In fact,” her voice dropped into a lower, teasing lilt, “you seemed more than happy about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha refused to dignify that with a response. Instead, she spun on her heel and marched back into the bathroom, muttering curses under her breath. She finished brushing her teeth as quickly as possible, trying to ignore the faint laughter drifting in from the other room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Back in the bedroom, she pulled a purple sweater over her head and tried her best to arrange her hair to cover the marks. But no matter how she positioned it, there were too many to hide completely. From behind her, Rio let out another laugh, clearly enjoying the sight of her failed attempts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s gaze darted around the room until it landed on Rio’s scarf, draped casually over a chair in the corner. Without a second thought, she snatched it up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey!” Rio called, sitting up. “It’s cold out, what if I need my scarf?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned, her glare sharp enough to cut through steel. “You should’ve thought about that before you went full Dracula on me,” she shot back, wrapping the scarf around her neck with a tug.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled, watching as Agatha slipped on her boots and made her way to the door. “See you later,” Agatha said, her tone brisk as she stepped outside, not sparing Rio another glance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once the door shut behind her, Agatha leaned back against it, letting out a long breath she hadn’t realised she’d been holding. Bit as much as Rio drove her insane, Agatha couldn’t stop the faint smile tugging at the corners of her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     — — — —
    </p>
    <p>
     The warm smell of coffee and baked goods enveloped Agatha as she stepped into the small, bustling restaurant. Her eyes scanned the room, searching for the familiar red hair, and it didn’t take long to spot Wanda standing at a corner table, waving at her with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, hey! It’s so good to see you,” Wanda greeted warmly, stepping forward to pull her into a hug.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha returned the embrace, a genuine smile spreading across her face. “Wanda, wow. It’s been… gosh, it must have been since that conference on Parkinson’s, what? Six years ago?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda laughed as they pulled apart and settled into their seats. “Wow. That long, huh?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t help but marvel at how little Wanda had changed. She looked exactly as Agatha remembered her from their master’s program. Her kind, round eyes sparkled with the same warmth and her easy smile was unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, how are you doing? What’s going on in your life?” Agatha asked as she shrugged off her coat and draped it over the back of her chair. Her hands moved instinctively toward the scarf still looped around her neck, but she froze halfway through pulling it away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes widened as she realised what she’d almost done.
     <em>
      Oh no. Absolutely not.
     </em>
     Agatha’s fingers fumbled as she quickly adjusted the scarf back into place, cursing Rio under her breath. She forced her focus back to Wanda, hoping her momentary panic hadn’t been too obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda didn’t seem to notice, her expression alight as she answered. “Oh, I’m great! I’m working in the neuro-oncology department now, so I’m doing mostly research into brain cancer and various tumours.” Agatha nodded, genuinely impressed. Wanda continued, “What else? Well, I’m still with Vision!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled at that, and Wanda went on. “I know! We’ve been together since we were all studying here! He’s now a lecturer in the engineering department. Oh! And, as you may remember, we were married five years ago last month!” Wanda’s face lit up as she spoke, her smile soft and full of fondness. But Agatha’s own stomach dropped at the words.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’d been invited to the wedding, of course. It had been right after Nicky’s death, though, and the thought of attending had been unbearable at the time. Her world had been falling apart; celebrating someone else’s happiness had felt impossible. After that her and Wanda had drifted, she hadn’t even spoken to her since then, not until she reached out a few days ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am so, so sorry again that I wasn’t able to make it, Wanda,” Agatha said, her voice earnest as she met her old friend’s eyes. “I’m sure it was a beautiful day.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda brushed it off with a scoff and a smile. “It’s no worry, Agatha. Both of us would have loved to have you there, but we understood, life gets in the way sometimes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled, relief washing over her. Wanda had always been gracious, one of the many things she’d admired about her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a waiter, who took their orders. As the waiter left, Agatha leaned back in her chair, her scarf still securely in place, her thoughts only half on the conversation that had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn’t stop her mind from wandering back to Rio, her teasing smirk, the way she’d laughed when Agatha had tried and failed to hide her neck this morning.
     <em>
      Why am I letting her get to me like this?
     </em>
     Agatha thought, shaking her head lightly to clear it. She needed to focus on Wanda now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda leaned forward, a mischievous glint sparking in her eyes as she rested her chin on one hand. “So, Agatha. Anything new in your love life?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, rolling her eyes as she reached for her coffee. “Oh, Wanda, please. Nothing even moderately exciting going on with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda frowned dramatically, her lips twitching with a playful smile. “Really? That’s disappointing. I was hoping for something scandalous.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed, shaking her head, but a hesitation stalled her movement. She took a sip of her coffee to cover it, her thoughts racing. It might actually be nice to get some advice from Wanda, someone who’d walked a similar path and understood the complications that came with their positions. But… no. Absolutely not. This was too personal, too vulnerable. Agatha prided herself on her ability to keep people at arm’s length unless absolutely necessary. And she hadn’t seen Wanda in years.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry to disappoint,” she added at Wanda’s pout with a light laugh, hoping to steer the conversation away.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then an idea began to form, nudging at the edges of her mind.
     <em>
      Maybe I don’t have to fully disclose anything,
     </em>
     she thought, stirring her coffee absently.
     <em>
      Maybe I can frame it differently and still get the advice I need.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned back slightly, clearing her throat. “Although,” she began, her voice casual, “there
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     an interesting situation in the lab I’d love your take on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda perked up instantly, her curiosity piqued as she sat straighter in her chair. “Oh, do carry on. Sounds juicy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t help but laugh, though her stomach twisted with nerves. She hesitated for a moment, choosing her words carefully. “There’s a-” she paused, searching for the right phrase, “-a friend of mine who’s in a bit of a situation. Essentially, she’s working on a project with someone, a research project, and she thinks she might be… attracted to them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s eyes widened with delighted shock as she cut in, “Ooh, fun! Lab romance?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed, glancing down at her lap, though the colour rising in her cheeks wasn’t entirely from amusement. “Not so fast,” she said, shaking her head. “It isn’t that simple. The problem is… this person is a lot younger than my friend. Like a
     <em>
      lot
     </em>
     , lot younger. And my friend is in a position of major seniority.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s expression turned thoughtful, her gaze drifting toward the ceiling as she imagined the situation. “Are there any rules set by the university or the lab about people in their positions having relationships?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha frowned, considering the question. “No… no, I suppose there aren’t,” she admitted. “But it’s more about my friend’s personal boundaries. She likes to keep her professional life completely separate from her personal life. But no matter how hard she tries to stay away from this person, it just…” She trailed off, the words sticking in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “…It just doesn’t work?” Wanda finished for her, leaning forward with an understanding nod. Agatha met Wanda’s gaze, her chest tightening as she nodded slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s brows furrowed briefly, then smoothed as she leaned back. “Wow, that’s pretty dramatic,” she said, her voice tinged with both sympathy and curiosity. “I’d say this: if she just
     <em>
      can’t
     </em>
     stay away from this person, there’s probably a reason why. Honestly, as much as she’s worried that a relationship would cause problems for their work, it sounds like it’s
     <em>
      already
     </em>
     causing a problem. If she’s as infatuated as you described—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Infatuated?!” Agatha cut in, too quickly, too sharply. She froze, cursing herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda blinked, her head tilting slightly, confusion flickering across her face. Agatha forced herself to smile, though her chest felt tight.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well,” Wanda continued, though she eyed Agatha carefully now, “whatever you want to call it, it sounds like your friend has really strong feelings for this person. If she just can’t stay away, I’d say it’s meant to be. Why try to stop fate? And besides, if the university doesn’t have any rules against it, she should go for it!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, the sound more defensive than she intended. Her stomach twisted unpleasantly, though she wasn’t sure if it was from Wanda’s suggestion or her own reaction to it.
     <em>
      Go for it? That’s insane, right?
     </em>
     she thought, a thousand objections flooding her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tension eased slightly as their food arrived, and the conversation gradually shifted to reminiscing about their master’s days and sharing updates on old classmates. Agatha forced herself to focus, laughing along with Wanda’s stories and sharing a few of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     The laughter from their table had died down by the time waiter came with their check. Wanda leaned back in her chair, sipping the last of her coffee when her eyes suddenly widened. “Hold on,” she gasped, setting the mug down abruptly and fixing Agatha with an incredulous stare.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked, startled by the shift in energy. “What is it?” she asked, raising her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can’t believe I haven’t asked about your current research yet!” Wanda exclaimed, a hand pressed to her chest as if the oversight physically pained her. “God, I’m sitting across from one of the biggest names in neuroscience, and all I’ve asked about is your love life.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled, a faint blush colouring her cheeks. “Oh no, Wanda, you’ve got your priorities straight,” she quipped, but she straightened in her chair, the familiar excitement of her work bubbling to the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, since you asked-” Agatha started, “I’ve got two studies going on at the moment. The first is looking at how depression in early life can act as a risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s later in life. That one’s a solo publication. And the other is about how seizure activity can lead to increased tau deposition and thereby increase Alzheimer’s risk. It’s really fascinating. I feel like I’m in a good place with my research right now and-”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda interrupted with a curious glint in her eye, “Who are you doing the seizure study with?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze mid-sentence, blinking at Wanda in surprise. The question seemed to come out of nowhere, and her mind raced.
     <em>
      There’s no way she knows about Rio. Right?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda, seeing Agatha’s sudden tension, added, “Well, you said the depression study is solo, so I assumed you have a partner for the other one. Anyone I’d know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a soft breath, her chest loosening slightly. She allowed herself to smile as she answered, “Oh, no, not anyone you’d know. Her name is Rio Vidal. She’s one of my PhD students.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda nodded along, intrigued, as Agatha continued, “It’s actually a funny story how we started working together. She came to me after finding a flaw in my previous paper on the topic. Then, get this, asked if I wanted to be part of disproving my own theory.” Agatha trailed off, a fond laugh escaping her as the memory replayed in her mind. She didn’t notice Wanda’s expression shift.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s smirk grew mischievous, her eyes widening with the spark of realisation. “Wait a second…” she began slowly. “So, you’re working with a student. Someone much younger than you. On a research project.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s stomach dropped as she saw the pieces click for Wanda. Wanda’s eyes widened in delight, and she practically shouted, “Agatha Harkness! That situation you asked about earlier? That was you, wasn’t it? There’s no friend! You have a
     <em>
      crush
     </em>
     on your student!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda,” Agatha hissed, her cheeks burning as she threw a furtive glance around the restaurant. She rubbed her face with her hands, mortified. “By all means, scream that a little louder, why don’t you? Let’s go shout it on the streets!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda was too busy dissolving into laughter to respond immediately. Agatha groaned, rolling her eyes at her friend’s amusement. “And don’t use the word ‘crush,’” she added sternly. “That makes me sound twelve years old.”
    </p>
    <p>
     But Wanda was already doubling over, her giggles uncontrollable. “I just… wow,” she managed between laughs. “Never in my life did I think I’d see the day. Stone-cold Agatha Harkness, of all people, catching feelings for a
     <em>
      student
     </em>
     !”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, pushing her chair back as she rose to her feet. She grabbed her coat and said dryly, “I’m leaving. I swear to god, Wanda.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda stood too, catching Agatha’s arm as she tried to move past. “No, no! I’m sorry!” she said through her laughter, her face alight with amusement and sincerity. “I actually think it’s really cute. I mean it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head, exasperated but unable to keep the corner of her mouth from twitching upward. “Right. Well, I really do need to go if I want to make it to this lecture on time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda sighed, stepping in for a quick hug. “Wait,” she said suddenly, her grip tightening slightly as a thought occurred to her. “Will the student be giving the lecture with you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha fixed Wanda with a glare that could have frozen fire. “I’m leaving now. Goodbye,” she deadpanned, though her lips curved into a small, reluctant smile as she hugged Wanda again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Bye, Agatha.” Wanda replied, still grinning as she stepped back. “Don’t think this is the last you’re hearing about it!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, shook her head, and walked out the door, laughing softly under her breath as she went.

    <p>
     Agatha paused outside the door of the hotel room, her hand hovering over the handle as she took a breath. Wanda’s words from earlier replayed in her mind, clear as a bell:
     <em>
      You should go for it.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been contemplating it for the entire walk back. The rational side of her, the one that liked order and control, screamed at her to keep her distance. To keep things professional. But the other part of her, the part that flared whenever Rio laughed too loudly, or glanced at her with those sharp, dark eyes, wasn’t ready to let go of the possibility of
     <em>
      more.
     </em>
     <em>
      You have to decide, Agatha.
     </em>
     She thought to herself.
     <em>
      You can’t keep dancing around this forever.
     </em>
     She shook her head, clearing the fog of indecision.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not now,” she muttered, her voice barely audible.
    </p>
    <p>
     She braced herself, squaring her shoulders as she finally pushed open the door. The sight that greeted her made her breath catch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood in the center of the room, a picture of casual confidence in black tailored trousers and an open white shirt. The shirt hung loose, framing the sharp angles of her collarbone and the curve of her black lace bra. Her hair was slightly mussed, as if she’d just run her fingers through it in frustration, and her long, lean frame was caught mid-motion as she tugged on the cuffs of her shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s brain screeched to a halt. Her first instinct was to avert her eyes, to
     <em>
      not stare,
     </em>
     but her gaze betrayed her, tracing the lines of Rio’s torso and the casual grace of her movements.
     <em>
      Get it together,
     </em>
     she chastised herself, but her body didn’t listen. Rio must have felt the weight of her stare because she turned her head, a slow grin spreading across her face as their eyes met.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha?” Rio said, her tone laced with amusement as she arched a brow. “You good?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of her name jolted Agatha back into her own skin. She forced herself to meet Rio’s gaze, although her face burned. Clearing her throat, she stepped fully into the room and busied herself with unbuttoning her coat, hanging it neatly on the back of the chair by the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How long do we have?” Agatha asked, willing her voice to sound calm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced at her watch. “Uh, like ten minutes,” she said absently. A moment later, her eyes widened as the fact sunk in, “Shit! Ten minutes? Really?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned back to the mirror in a flurry of motion, grabbing her hairbrush off the counter and hastily running it through her dark locks. Agatha leaned against the desk, watching the chaos unfold with a bemused smile tugging at her lips. Rio’s movements were quick but uncoordinated, her usual air of control dissolving as she tried to do everything at once - brush her hair, tuck in her shirt, and locate her mascara all at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’ve had so long to get ready,” Agatha said, a teasing lilt in her voice. “What have you even been doing this whole time?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio paused, her hairbrush stopping mid-stroke. She turned her head slightly, glancing at Agatha over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Preparing for the lecture,” she said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world to be prepping for a lecture that they had very much under control. Thye had been planning it since they got the email from Calderu and all the details should have been ironed out by now. Rio continued, “I was thinking through possible questions they might ask, making sure I know how to answer them. I don’t want to get caught out and seem like a total idiot during my first lecture.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilted her head, studying her. There was something undeniably endearing about Rio in this moment. For all her sharp wit and seemingly effortless confidence, it was clear she cared deeply about this, and it struck a chord in Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You couldn’t seem like an idiot if you tried,” Agatha said softly, barely louder than a whisper, the words slipping out before she could stop herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio froze. Slowly, she turned to face Agatha fully, her dark eyes narrowing slightly as a small, surprised smile tugged at the corners of her lips. “What was that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes widened slightly as she shook her head quickly, crossing her arms over her chest in a half-hearted attempt to deflect. “Oh, nothing,” she said, trying to sound casual.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn’t buying it. Her smile grew wider, a mischievous glint lighting up her face. She leaned back against the chest of drawers , crossing her arms loosely as she tilted her head. “Really? Because to me, it sounded like you were complimenting me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, rolling her eyes in an exaggerated gesture as she straightened from the desk. “Just shut up and finish getting ready so we can leave,” she said, her voice sharper than she intended.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed softly, turning back to the mirror but clearly pleased with herself. “Whatever you say, Sunshine.” she quipped, brushing on the last swipe of mascara with a flourish.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grabbed her bag, checking its contents as a distraction. Her heart was still racing, and her thoughts felt tangled. She glanced up briefly to see Rio straightening her shirt and adjusting the sleeves, the faintest smile still playing on her lips. Agatha shook her head to herself.
     <em>
      Focus,
     </em>
     she thought again. But the warmth in her chest at the sight of Rio’s quiet confidence was hard to ignore.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a short walk to the university, and Agatha found herself unusually quiet as they made their way down the tree-lined path. When they reached the gates of St. John’s College, nostalgia swept over her in a wave. The stone buildings and the green lawns stretched out like an echo of her youth. She couldn’t help but be drawn into memories of the countless mornings rushing to lectures, the afternoons with Wanda sprawled out under the sun, textbooks open but rarely read as they gossiped about professors and shared dreams of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook herself from her reverie as they walked through the gate, turning her attention back to Rio. But just as they crossed the threshold, Rio slowed her pace.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, what-” Agatha began, but stopped when she caught sight of Rio’s face. Her brows were raised, her eyes slightly wide, and her lips curved into a faint, disbelieving smile. Rio’s gaze was fixed straight ahead, her body unusually still.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What’s wrong with you?” Agatha asked, trying to inject some impatience into her voice. “We’re going to be late.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t answer right away. Instead, a quiet laugh slipped from her lips, soft and tinged with something Agatha couldn’t quite place. Following her gaze, Agatha turned to see what had captured Rio’s attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     Standing near the entrance to the courtyard was a young woman with wavy brown hair that framed her face in soft, loose curls. She was scrolling through her phone, oblivious to their presence. She wore a fitted turtleneck, her jeans and boots perfectly casual yet put-together. There was something magnetic about her, the way she stood, the slight curve of her lips as she scrolled, it all spoke to an easy confidence that reminded her far too much of Rio herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who’s that?” Agatha asked, her voice coming out sharper than she intended.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed again, this time under her breath, before finally turning to Agatha with a smirk. “That,” she said, her tone light but amused, “is Sophie. My ex.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s stomach dropped. She blinked, thrown off-balance, and forced herself to keep her expression neutral.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could muster a response, Sophie looked up from her phone. Her gaze scanned the courtyard, and then her face lit up with recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio?” she called, her voice warm and unmistakably pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s posture shifted immediately, her usual confident ease softening into something looser, more genuine. “Sophie. Wow, long time no see.” she said, a smile spreading across her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha barely had time to process the words before Sophie closed the distance between them, throwing her arms around Rio in a hug. The casual familiarity of the embrace made something twist painfully in Agatha’s chest. Her eyes flicked over the scene, taking in the way Rio’s hands rested lightly on Sophie’s back, her expression soft with fondness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s mouth tightened, but she stayed rooted to the spot, her fingers curling into fists at her sides.
     <em>
      Why does this bother me so much?
     </em>
     she thought, trying and failing to shake off the irrational emotions swelling within her.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they pulled apart, Rio tilted her head, her smile lingering. “So,” she said, her tone light and genuinely curious, “you’re doing your PhD at Oxford, huh? Impressive.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Sophie grinned, tucking a stray lock of hair behind her ear. “Yeah. It’s been a whirlwind, but I’m loving it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stood rooted to the spot, her lips pressed into a thin line. She felt like an outsider, a voyeur watching an exchange she had no business being part of.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Sophie turned her attention to her, her brow furrowing slightly. “And who’s this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s response was immediate, though her voice took on a slightly different tone, careful and deliberate. “This is my…” she paused for a second, her gaze flicking to Agatha for a second, “…my PhD supervisor, Agatha Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The words hit Agatha like a slap. For a moment, she didn’t know why it bothered her so much, Rio was technically correct, after all, but something about the way she said it made her stomach drop. Her lips parted slightly, but no words came out as the odd weight of disappointment settled in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      What did you expect her to say?
     </em>
     Agatha thought, trying to rationalise the sudden ache.
     <em>
      This is my supervisor slash co-researcher who I’ve hooked up with a couple times?
     </em>
     Agatha shook the thoughts away. This was silly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sophie’s eyes widened slightly, a flash of recognition crossing her face. “Wait,” she said, her voice laced with awe. “
     <em>
      The
     </em>
     Agatha Harkness? As in the most published woman in neuroscience?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s instinctive pride at the attention barely cut through the completely irrational hate she harboured for this woman. She forced a polite smile, waving a hand as if to brush off the compliment. “Oh, I don’t know about that,” she said smoothly, though her voice was tighter than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sophie laughed softly, clearly unconvinced. “No, seriously. I’ve read your papers. Your work is… incredible.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s gaze flicked between Sophie and Agatha, her smirk returning as she caught the way Agatha’s jaw was clenched. Agatha cleared her throat, shifting her weight slightly as she fought to regain her composure. “That’s very kind of you, thank you. But we really should get going. We have a lecture to give.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced at her, an amused gleam in her eye, before nodding. “Right. Duty calls.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Sophie smiled, stepping back. “Well, it was great to see you again, Rio. And, Dr Harkness, it was an honour to meet you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha inclined her head politely, already turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they walked toward the lecture hall, Agatha felt the tension coil in her shoulders. She couldn’t stop replaying the way Rio had smiled at Sophie, the way her voice had softened, the easy familiarity between them. She told herself it didn’t matter, but the knot in her chest said otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a moment, Rio spoke, her voice low and teasing. “What’s with the face?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shot her a sharp look. “No face.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked, falling into step beside her. “You’re cute when you’re jealous, you know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha huffed, her eyes fixed straight ahead. “I’m not jealous, don’t flatter yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled softly, falling into step beside her.
     <em>
      Get a grip,
     </em>
     Agatha told herself, her nails digging into the strap of her bag. Agatha’s mind churned, her jealousy simmering just beneath the surface. She replayed the moment over and over, the way Rio’s arms had wrapped around Sophie with that casual ease, the fondness in her eyes, the softness in her voice when she said her name. It was infuriating, irrational, and yet Agatha couldn’t deny how deeply it bothered her. The pang in her chest was more than jealousy… it was fear. Fear of what it meant that she cared this much. But as the ache persisted, as her grip on her composure grew more tenuous, a startling thought crept into her mind:
     <em>
      Maybe I should stop fighting this.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     What was the point of resisting anymore? She had spent weeks pretending that what was happening between her and Rio was nothing but a passing flirtation, something she could dismiss, compartmentalise, and eventually forget. But she couldn’t ignore the way Rio made her feel - how alive and disarmed she was in her presence, how the smallest of smiles or a teasing remark could tilt her entire world. Maybe it was time to stop running from this, to stop pretending that her feelings didn’t exist. The idea was terrifying, butit was also freeing in a way she hadn’t expected.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lecture hall was already buzzing when Agatha and Rio entered, the hum of voices and rustling papers filling the air. Agatha scanned the room, noting the faces of eager students and seasoned academics alike, all awaiting their presentation. Despite her lingering frustration from their earlier encounter, she shook it off, forcing herself to focus. This was her domain, the stage where she thrived.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio followed her to the front of the room, setting her bag on the table and glancing around with a mixture of curiosity and nerves. Agatha noticed the faint shift in her posture, the way her hands flexed slightly as if to dispel tension. It was subtle, almost imperceptible, but Agatha saw it all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ready?” Agatha murmured as she adjusted the microphone on the podium.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gave her a quick smile, her eyes sparkling despite her obvious apprehension. “Born ready.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The projector flickered to life, illuminating the screen behind them with the title slide:
     <em>
      “Can Seizures Increase Tau Deposition
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      leading to Alzheimer’s disease?’
     </em>
     her professional mask slipping into place as she began to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Ms Vidal and I are here to discuss our findings on the relationship between epilepsy and Alzheimer’s, with a particular focus on the role of seizures in Tau deposition.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As Agatha launched into the presentation, her voice steady and confident, she felt herself settle into the rhythm of the lecture. She outlined the basic mechanisms of tau aggregation and its impact on neuronal function, clicking through slides filled with diagrams and graphs. The room seemed captivated, eyes fixed on her as she explained their research with her characteristic poise and authority.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood slightly to the side, hands clasped behind her back, her gaze fixed on Agatha with a mix of awe and respect. Every so often, Agatha caught a glimpse of her, noticing the way Rio's focus seemed to falter, as if she were momentarily lost in admiration rather than the lecture itself, her expression soft and captivated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, a hand shot up in the audience, and a sharp-looking man in the second row began to speak, “This is fascinating work, but do you have any concrete findings to support your proposed correlation between seizure activity and Tau deposition? Is it just theoretical at this stage, or do you have data?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused, her gaze flicking to Rio. Without a word, she tilted her head slightly and gave a small nod, a silent cue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised her eyebrows, but stepped forward, clearing her throat. “We do, actually,” she said, her voice steady but carrying a spark of enthusiasm. “In our preliminary studies, we conducted an analysis of post-mortem brain tissue from patients with epilepsy and found a statistically significant increase in Tau levels compared to controls. In one specific subset, those with frequent seizures showed nearly double the accumulation.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hands moved expressively as she spoke, pointing toward a slide that displayed their data. Her voice grew stronger, more animated, as she explained the methodology and highlighted the key findings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned to watch her, momentarily forgetting the audience. There was something magnetic about Rio in that moment. The way her eyes lit up when she spoke, the fervor in her tone as she described their work with such clarity and conviction. Agatha felt herself drawn in, mesmerised by the sheer passion that radiated from her. Rio’s intelligence shone like a beacon, and it wasn’t just the words she said, it was the way she carried herself, the confidence in her movements, the way her lips quirked slightly when she hit a point she was particularly proud of. Agatha barely noticed the approving nods from the audience or the way a few people scribbled notes furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio finished her explanation, glancing briefly at Agatha as if seeking reassurance. Agatha snapped out of her reverie, nodding once, her lips curving into the faintest smile. “Well explained,” Agatha whispered to her before turning back to the audience. “I think that answers the question.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The discussion continued, but Agatha couldn’t fully focus anymore. Rio had stolen her attention completely, and for the first time, she wasn’t sure she wanted to take it back.
    </p>
    <p>
     After answering a few more questions, the lecture finally came to a close. To Agatha’s quiet amusement, Rio had taken the lead during the Q&amp;A session, fielding most of the questions with remarkable ease. Each time someone tried to challenge her, she had countered with confidence and precision, leaving no room for doubt. Agatha couldn’t quite place the swell of emotions building inside her as they walked out of the lecture hall. It wasn’t just relief or admiration, it was something more. Pride, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
     She glanced at Rio as they stepped into the crisp afternoon air, her lips curving into a genuine smile. They crossed the street to the small café nestled between two old stone buildings, the scent of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the air as they stepped inside. After ordering, they settled into a corner table with two steaming cups of coffee, the bustling noise of the café creating a cozy background hum.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled as she sat down, “You did good, Rio. Well done.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned to her, her face lighting up with a grin. “Well, all that practice I did paid off, I guess.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed softly, shaking her head. “You know, you can be very mature and impressive when you’re not actively arguing with everything I say.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked as she picked up her cup. “Thank you… I think? I can’t tell if that’s a compliment or an insult.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled, taking a sip of her coffee. “Bit of both, maybe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned back in her chair with a dramatic sigh. “But oh my god, that one question from that guy? What even was that? ‘If seizure activity makes up part of the aetiology of Alzheimers, does that mean you could cure Alzheimer’s by just slowing seizures?’ I mean, does the guy know the definition of a risk factor? Like, what am I even supposed to say to that…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed, nearly choking on her drink. “Oh, Rio. That’s something you’re going to have to get used to in this field. Men in science have an unbelievable knack for disguising absurdity as expertise. They have these insane superiority complexes, and when they realize a woman knows more than they do, it’s like their brains short-circuit. So they just… blurt out the first idiotic question that comes to mind. And of course, they try to couch it in semi-sophisticated wording to maintain the illusion of competence. Most of the time it boils down to absolute idiocy”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, shaking her head. “So basically, science is like a giant masquerade ball of fragile male egos?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “Absolutely. But you handled it very well.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s laughter softened, her expression shifting into something gentler. She looked down at her cup for a moment, then back up at Agatha, her smile more genuine now. “Thank you,” she said, her voice quieter but no less sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s chest tightened, caught off guard by the warmth in Rio’s gaze. She looked away, focusing on her coffee, but she couldn’t stop the corners of her mouth from lifting in response. “You’re welcome,” she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a sip of her coffee, then leaned forward, resting her chin on her hand as she gave Agatha a playful smile. “You know,” she said, her voice light but tinged with something deeper, “you’re surprisingly generous with the compliments today. Is this, like, a once-in-a-lifetime thing? Should I be taking pictures to remember this moment?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, her lips curving into a smirk. “Don’t push your luck, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, come on,” Rio said, her grin widening. “Admit it. You were proud of me back there. I saw the way you were looking at me during the Q&amp;A.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took another sip of her coffee to hide the flush creeping up her neck. “I was observing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right.” Rio leaned back, crossing her arms with a mock-serious expression. “You were observing with the intensity of someone admiring a fine piece of art. Totally professional.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed dramatically, but the smile tugging at her lips betrayed her. “You’re insufferable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah,” Rio said, her voice softening as her eyes searched Agatha’s. “But you like me anyway.”
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, the teasing tone between them shifted into something quieter, more intimate. Agatha felt her chest tighten as she met Rio’s gaze, unable to look away. There was a warmth in Rio’s expression that made it impossible to deny the truth anymore, she did like her. More than liked her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha placed her cup down carefully, her fingers lingering on the edge as she spoke. “You’re... difficult to ignore,” she admitted, her voice lower than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head, her smile softening. “I’m very okay with you not ignoring me.” Rio leaned forward again, her hand brushing lightly against Agatha’s on the table. The touch was fleeting but enough to send a spark of warmth through Agatha’s chest. “You know, that sounded dangerously close to a confession.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched slightly at the sincerity in Rio’s voice. She glanced down at their hands, her fingers twitching as if tempted to close the distance. “Rio-” she began, unsure of what she was even going to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned closer, her voice soft but teasing. “You don’t have to say anything. Just keep looking at me like that, and I’ll figure it out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed despite herself, shaking her head as she finally reached for her coffee again. “You’re impossible.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grin turned softer as she rested her chin on her hand again. “Yeah, but you’re stuck with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t reply, but her heart felt lighter somehow. Maybe, she thought, being stuck with Rio wasn’t such a bad thing after all. In that moment, Agatha felt a quiet pull, an almost overwhelming urge to surrender to the feelings that had been stirring inside her since Rio had walked into her lab weeks ago. She glanced across at Rio’s dark eyes, still glowing from the exhilaration of their successful lecture, her lips curling into a soft smile as her hair fell around her face, catching the sunlight just enough to give her an almost ethereal glow. Maybe this feeling, this connection, was where she was meant to be. Maybe it was time to stop fighting the inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
     But just as the thought settled in her mind, Rio spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh yeah, by the way…” she said with a chuckle, shaking her head as if still amused by the memory. “The funniest thing happened right before the lecture. Um-”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, urging her to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smile faltered slightly as her eyes locked with Agatha’s. “After we bumped into Sophie, she texted me. She asked if I wanted to go out for dinner with her tonight.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s stomach dropped. Her mind raced for a second, a sharp sting of jealousy cutting through her thoughts. She kept her gaze steady, but her heart pounded wildly beneath her calm exterior.
    </p>
    <p>
     She searched Rio’s intense expression, her breath catching as their eyes held each other. “What, like a date?” Agatha asked, her voice lighter than she intended, almost teasing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded slowly, her gaze unwavering, searching Agatha’s face as she tried to read her reaction. “Yeah, like a date.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched as her heart sank. For a moment, the world felt like it shifted beneath her. Her pulse throbbed in her ears, and all she could think was that she didn’t want Rio to go. But then, without thinking, her mouth opened and words blurted out before she had the chance to stop them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, you should go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The admission hung in the air between them, Agatha’s mind spinning, unsure of what had just come out. Her voice sounded far away, distant from her own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared back at her in disbelief, her eyebrows rising as the surprise and hurt flickered across her face for a fleeting moment. But just as quickly, irritation replaced those emotions, her jaw tightening and a sharp scoff escaping her lips. “I should go, really? That’s what you think?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t speak for a second. Her mind was a whirlwind of thoughts; confusion, regret, and something deeper she couldn’t quite place. The weight of her words hit her like a heavy wave, and she felt the sting settle deep in her chest. She wasn’t sure what had compelled her to say that, but there was no going back now. She couldn’t take it back, and the silence stretched out between them. Still, there was no choice but to double down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, she managed to speak, her voice steady despite the turmoil inside her. “Yeah, you should go. She seems nice, and you two obviously had a connection.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head, a scoff escaping her lips as her eyes rolled in frustration. Agatha had never seen her like this. So serious, so annoyed, she looked downright infuriated. “Fine, Agatha. I will. I’ll go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stared back at her, her own annoyance bubbling to the surface. The words had come out so easily, and now she regretted them more than she cared to admit. Yet her stubbornness held her firm. “Yeah, fine. Go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned forward again, her tone dropping to something softer, more biting. “Oh, I will.” She paused, leaning forwards and letting the silence settle before adding, “Unless, Agatha, you can think of any reason why I
     <em>
      shouldn’t
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bristled, leaning toward her in return, their elbows now resting on the table between them. Her heart pounded in her chest, her breath coming faster as her mind raced. Why had she said that? Why did it feel like she was watching something slip away? Every instinct told her to list a million reasons she shouldn’t go, to tell her everything she felt, to lean forward and kiss her right here. But her pride wouldn’t let her. “Nope, nothing comes to mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The tension hung thick in the air as they stared each other down, neither willing to back down. Agatha’s fingers tapped anxiously against the table, her mind screaming for a different response, but she couldn’t find the words. Finally, she broke the silence, her voice steady but sharp. “I have some things I need to do this afternoon. I’ll see you back at the hotel.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Without another word, she rose from her seat, her heels clicking softly against the café floor as she walked toward the door. Once outside, the cool air hit her, but she couldn’t shake the feeling of her hands trembling slightly. She clenched them into fists, taking a deep breath as she walked down the street, her thoughts a chaotic mess of confusion, jealousy, and something more she didn’t quite understand yet.

     <p>
      also I will take any opportunity to hate on men in science bc THEYRE SO STUPID, that question was inspired by a really annoying man who asked basically the same thing at a lecture I went to, dude just because u use the word aetiology doesn’t make ur question not stupid !!
     </p>

    <p>
     Agatha walked aimlessly through a park she had found after wandering down the street for god knows how long. Her boots scuffing against the gravel as the late afternoon sun spilled through the bare trees, but the beauty of it all barely registered. Her mind was a tangled mess, replaying the conversation with Rio on an endless loop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why had she told her to go? She didn’t even mean it, of course she didn’t want Rio to go on that date. But when it came time to say it, to let her real feelings slip past her defences, she just couldn’t. And, if she was admitting it, she had been a little annoyed that Rio even brought up the date in the first place. She knew it was unfair of her, after all, Agatha had made a right mess of both of their feelings this morning. But still, she hadn’t expected Rio to go out with someone else. So, she had brushed aside whatever affection she felt for Rio, instead, she had pushed her away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, God,” she muttered under her breath, running a hand through her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     She quickened her pace, as if walking faster might help her escape the spiralling thoughts. Rio had said she was going. Was she really going? Agatha’s steps faltered as the possibility settled over her. Agatha couldn’t ignore the memory of Rio’s face back in the cafe. The way her shoulders had straightened, the determined glint in her eyes. That hadn’t looked like a bluff.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought made Agatha’s chest tighten painfully. Her mind started spiralling again, conjuring images she didn’t want to see: Rio sitting across from Sophie, laughing, smiling, maybe even reaching out to touch her hand. Agatha’s stomach churned at the idea, and she stopped walking, pressing a hand against her middle as if that might ease the sudden nausea.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” she whispered aloud, not caring who was listening. Let them think she was crazy for fuck’s sake! She couldn't bring herself to care right now. “No way. She wouldn’t actually go. She wouldn’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
     But then again, why wouldn’t she? Agatha had practically shoved her toward it. Hadn’t she? Telling her to go was like slamming the door in her face, and if Rio had opened another one, could she even blame her? Agatha groaned, pressing the heels of her palms to her eyes. She couldn’t believe she’d let it get to this point. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. None of it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lowered her hands and looked out at the park, her eyes landing on the swirling leaves caught in the wind. They danced and twisted in chaotic circles before falling back to the earth. It felt fitting somehow, Like her thoughts, her feelings, her whole relationship with Rio: a mess she couldn’t untangle, no matter how hard she tried.
    </p>
    <p>
     No. Agatha straightened her shoulders, laughing quietly to herself as she rolled her eyes. There was no way Rio was actually going to go. This was stupid. She absolutely wouldn’t. It was just something she said to get back at Agatha, right? To hurt her a little, the same way Agatha had hurt her by brushing everything off like it didn’t matter. That had to be it. Rio was fiery, stubborn. She knew how to throw a barb when she wanted to. This was just her way of lashing out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lingered in the park for a moment longer, watching the sun dip lower toward the horizon. The air had turned crisp, and the colours in the sky melted into a painterly display of gold, orange, and violet. Despite herself, Agatha found the scene calming, even as her thoughts swirled. She should head back to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
     The gravel crunched under Agatha’s boots as she walked back through the city. The street was alive with people bustling about. The faint scent of roasted chestnuts from a nearby vendor drifted through the air, mingling with the cool breeze. Neon signs blinked their messages into the dusk, and the headlights of taxis glimmered like fireflies in the growing dark.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of the city hummed in her ears as Agatha strode toward the hotel, a smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. Of course, Rio wasn’t actually going on this “date.” She could imagine it now. Rio sprawled across the bed, casually flipping through a magazine or scrolling on her phone, waiting to tease Agatha about how jealous she’d looked earlier. That’s what this was all about, wasn’t it? Rio was trying to get under her skin, to see if she could needle out a reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time Agatha reached the lift and pressed the button for her floor, she had built up her resolve. If Rio thought she was going to fall for this little game, she had another thing coming. Agatha wouldn’t give her the satisfaction. She chuckled under her breath, shaking her head as the lift began to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
     The doors slid open, and Agatha stepped into the corridor, her boots clicking softly against the carpeted floor. The hotel’s dim, warm lighting gave the hallway a cozy glow, and her steps slowed as she approached her room. She slid the keycard into the slot, hearing the beep and click of the lock disengaging.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio…” she began, smirking as she pushed the door open. But the words died on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn’t sprawled on the bed like Agatha had pictured. Instead, she stood by the mirror, applying mascara with practiced precision. Her outfit was… striking. A sleek black long-sleeve that clung perfectly to her figure and tailored dark green trousers that emphasised her graceful posture. Her hair was swept back into a bun, accentuating the sharp angles of her face. She wore smoky eyeshadow and was currently applying mascara.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, Agatha just stared, caught completely off guard. But then she recovered, telling herself that this only confirmed what she’d thought all along. Rio wasn’t
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     going on a date. She was just taking this ruse to the next level, all to rile Agatha up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hi,” Rio said curtly, glancing at Agatha through the mirror before turning back to finish her makeup.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked, then smirked as she dropped her bag onto the floor and strolled further into the room. “What are you doing?” she asked, her tone laced with feigned casualness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t even look at her this time. “I’m getting ready for my date, Agatha,” she said, her voice clipped but deliberate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled softly and rolled her eyes. She flopped onto her bed, grabbing her book from the bedside table and flipping it open to a random page as she muttered, “Oh, sure. Your
     <em>
      ‘date.’
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     She pretended to read, but her attention drifted almost immediately. Her gaze kept flicking up over the top of the book, stealing glances at Rio as she applied eyeliner. Agatha told herself it was just curiosity. Rio was going all out, after all, and it was kind of impressive how far she was willing to take this joke.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, the sight of Rio in that outfit, moving with such calm confidence, was… distracting. Agatha adjusted her position on the bed, trying to act like she wasn’t paying attention. She wasn’t falling for it, though. Not a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, apparently noticing the glances, caught her eye through the mirror, her expression cool and unreadable. Agatha quickly dropped her gaze back to the book, biting the inside of her cheek to stifle a reaction.
     <em>
      Let her think she’s winning this round,
     </em>
     she thought.
     <em>
      She’s the one putting on a whole production to get a rise out of me.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     But as Rio turned back to her reflection and picked up her lipstick, Agatha couldn’t help but steal another glance. She’d never admit it out loud, but Rio was infuriatingly good at this game.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watched as Rio slipped a phone and what looked like a small wallet into her pocket, then grabbed her shoes from the corner of the room. Her movements were deliberate, efficient. It was like a punch to the gut when she realised Rio wasn’t just
     <em>
      pretending
     </em>
     anymore. She was really leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hold on,” Agatha said, her voice sharp with disbelief. “Rio, you’re not actually going, are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stopped mid-step at the foot of Agatha’s bed, turning to face her with an expression of pure exasperation. “Yes, Agatha,” she said, her voice steady but pointed. “Yes, I am. I’ve told you twice already, I’m going.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, the sound hollow and forced. “I get the point, okay? This isn’t funny, Rio. Just stop.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes darkened, a storm brewing beneath her calm exterior. “Good thing I’m not trying to be funny, then.” she said, her tone biting. “I’m going.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It was only then that the truth hit Agatha with the force of a wave, leaving her scrambling for air. Her heart stuttered painfully, panic setting in.
     <em>
      She’s really going. She’s actually going on this date.
     </em>
     Agatha’s mind raced.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I-” Agatha stammered, her voice rising in pitch. “You can’t. What? But we-”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We what, Agatha?” Rio snapped, cutting her off. She stepped closer, her arms crossed tightly over her chest, her stance unyielding. “Please, go on. Because I’d
     <em>
      love
     </em>
     to hear what you have to say.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rose to her feet, her expression a mix of desperation and frustration. “That isn’t fair, Rio,” she said, her voice shaking. She was floundering, and she knew it, but she pressed on. “You know it’s my career that’s at stake if anything happens between us. Both of our careers. I’m scared, okay? But you said you’d wait. You- you said, ‘take your time.’ I thought you fucking meant that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s jaw clenched, and her eyes narrowed, her anger simmering just below the surface. Her tone, though quieter, was laced with frustration as she snapped, “I know that I said take your time, its just-”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So why are you going on this date?” Agatha interjected, her voice rising. “I thought you’d let me work my feelings out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The words came out in a rush, sharp and wounded, but they seemed to strike a deeper nerve in Rio. Her face twisted into something furious and raw, and before Agatha could blink, Rio’s voice broke through like a crack of thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “BECAUSE I CAN’T FUCKING TAKE IT ANYMORE, AGATHA!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The shout rang out, loud and unrestrained, leaving both women stunned in its wake. Rio inhaled sharply, pressing her hand to her face as a tear slipped free. She exhaled slowly, visibly pulling herself together before speaking again, her voice softer but no less resolute.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look,” Rio said, her tone trembling now, “I’m sorry. I really am. I understand the position you’re in, and I know I said ‘take your time,’ but I just can’t fucking do it anymore.” She swallowed hard, her voice catching as her hands dropped limply to her sides.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio-” Agatha started, but she was cut off again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. Let me finish,” Rio said firmly. She looked at Agatha, her eyes bright with unshed tears and a kind of exhaustion that seemed bone-deep. “Look, anyone can fucking see that there’s something here. You’re not blind, Agatha. But you just keep going back to the same fucking denial bullshit over and over again. At first, I laughed at it. I thought it would be a fun challenge, see if I could break through your façade, but-”
    </p>
    <p>
     She faltered, her voice cracking. Rio’s hands shook slightly as she gestured between them, and she laughed bitterly through her tears. “It’s breaking me, Agatha. I can’t take it anymore. Either you want to be with me, or you don’t. You don’t get to have me whenever you want and then pretend it didn’t happen the next morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s heart clenched, her throat tightening painfully as she struggled to find words, any words, that could stop the spiralling devastation before her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio held up a hand, silencing her once more. “So here’s how it’s going to be,” she said, her voice hoarse but steady. “Either you’re just my supervisor, I go on this date tonight, and tomorrow we go back to working on research and nothing more, or…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her voice softened, trembling under the weight of her words. “Or you admit that none of this has been an accident. That this is something more. And you tell me that you want it to happen.”

    <p>
     Agatha had been at work when the call came.
    </p>
    <p>
     The call that would change her life. A moment etched so deeply into her mind that even though it had been years, she still replayed it every time she closed her eyes. Even now, she could recall it as vividly as if it had happened yesterday. The memory itself was enough to leave her stomach clenching, as though someone had reached inside her and twisted her abdominal organs until she was hollow. And that was just the memory, living through it had been so much worse.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      ‘You’d better come up to the ward. It’s Nicky.’
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     That was what Nurse Sarah had said. Sarah was kind, compassionate, a steady presence throughout the six years since Nicky’s diagnosis. Tay-Sachs disease, the condition destroyed Nicky’s nervous system bit by bit, until his body could no longer sustain him. The doctors had initially given him a year to live and somehow Nicky had defied those odds, but Agatha always knew this day would come.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bloody irony of it all was not lost on Agatha, the top neuroscientist in her field, forced to watch her son’s brain wither away in front of her, with nothing she could fucking do. It gnawed at her constantly, a bitter reminder that all her knowledge and research, everything she had worked for, could be rendered useless by fate.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t remember whether she had even hung up the phone, it had all been all a blur as she bolted from her office. The lab building stood just across the road from the university hospital where Nicky was being cared for, but the journey across the street had felt like miles. Her mind had been mess, she hadn’t been sure where she was or which way was up or down, or why her
     <em>
      damn legs couldn’t carry her any fucking faster!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She had never been religious, not since she realised she didn’t have to conform to the senseless dogma her mother had preached throughout her childhood. By the time she left home, she wanted nothing to do with religion - or religious people, for that matter. Agatha understood not everyone was a homophobic, hateful zealot like the ones she had grown up around, but the mere mention of God was wrapped in layers of pain she couldn’t untangle. Besides, she doubted science and religion could truly coexist; to her, they seemed fundamentally at odds.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as she sprinted across the road, dodging cars and ignoring the blaring horns of buses, she had prayed. For the first time since she was eleven years old in her room asking god to make her
     <em>
      ‘normal’,
     </em>
     Agatha Harkness prayed.
     <em>
      Begged
     </em>
     was a better word really. She begged, to God, to Jesus, to Allah, to Buddha, to any deity or force that might be listening - even Death itself. She begged, over and over:
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Do not take him before I get there. Please, don’t let him go yet. Just please, let me see him. I need to see him. I need to see him… I need to see my son.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She had pushed through the hospital doors, her breath coming in gasps, her chest tight with fear. The hallways had blurred as she ran, her feet stumbling on the sterile tiles, her hands brushing the walls for balance. When she had finally reached the paediatric neurology ward, the nurses and doctors she had come to know over the years stood there, their faces etched with sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nicky, what’s- is he-” she had choked out, barely able to form the words.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, not yet.” Nurse Sarah said gently but firmly, placing a hand on Agatha’s shoulder. “No, he’s hanging on for now. He’s a strong boy, that one. But…” She hesitated, her voice softening. “I’m sorry, Agatha. I don’t think he has long. A few hours at most.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned heavily against the larger woman, clutching her for support as a choked sob had torn from her throat. She stayed there, rooted in place, for what felt like an eternity but was likely only a minute. The sobs came in relentless waves, one after another, they had seemed to surround her. Was Nurse Sarah crying too? Agatha couldn’t tell. She could barely register her own voice in that moment; it had felt as though she had left her body, hovering above and watching herself unravel.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last, Nurse Sarah, her eyes shimmering, had met Agatha’s gaze with a look that was both compassionate and firm before she finally spoke
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is the most horrific thing a mother can experience.” Sarah said finally, “I’m so sorry, Agatha. But you need to be strong for him. He can’t see you like this. Go in there and give him joy… love.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And that was just what Agatha had done. She had sat beside him, taking his fragile hand in hers, and had read to him, letting him choose his favorite books. Hours passed as she filled the room with stories, her voice unwavering even as her heart broke. She wanted these moments to be filled with happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eventually, Nicky looked up at her, his voice weak but full of joy and innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mmmm-mumma,” he had whispered, his speech slurred from the disease, but he pushed through. “I… I’m tir… tired.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And in that moment, Agatha’s heart had swelled with such an overwhelming rush of love and adoration. In an instant, her sadness and panic seemed to dissolve, leaving only the fierce need to make her son feel as comfortable and loved as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s okay, my lovely,” she whispered back, gently ruffling his hair as she pulled his blankets snug. A single tear traced down her cheek as her voice wavered, breaking with emotion. “You go to sleep, my sweet boy. Just relax, and Mumma will be right here next to you. Where I always am, Nicky. My sweet, sweet Nicky.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky’s weak hand gripped hers feebly, and he managed to give her a small, fragile smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I llo- I… I love you, Mmmm- Mumma,” he struggled out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned down, hugging him as gently as she could manage. Her instinct was to hold him as tight as she could and never let go, but she didn’t want to hurt him. She tucked his hair behind his ears and a tear streamed down her face as she bent to press a gentle kiss to his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love you, Nicky. Mumma loves you so much. Now rest, my sweet boy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And with that, he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     — — —
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha thought back to that memory more often than she cared to admit. She knew it wasn’t healthy, usually surfacing when something good was finally happening in her life. Her mind would dig up the deepest shame she had ever faced and pull her right back down. Not that she fought it much. She wasn’t exactly dragged kicking and screaming into misery. No, she had welcomed the sadness. Honestly, she thought she deserved it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that was the thought that echoed relentlessly in her mind as she now stood across from Rio, still reeling from the weight of the younger woman’s confession.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was right. Trying to distance herself from Rio had to stop. Agatha realised, in that moment, how deeply she had been clinging to her misery, how she had closed herself off when Nicky died. She had withdrawn from Wanda and Vision, pretending their friendship didn’t exist. She scared off acquaintances at work, becoming the
     <em>
      wicked witch of the lab
     </em>
     , convinced it was better to be feared than pitied. After all, she didn’t feel like she deserved comfort. She hadn’t even tried at romance… well, not until Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     People had been interested, of course, but she pushed them away as much as possible. It sounded silly now, but to her it had felt… selfish. After experiencing such a profound loss, she had convinced herself that she shouldn’t be able to feel positive emotions anymore. Love, attraction, it all seemed too far out of reach. She had assumed that part of her had died with Nicky.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio had been different. Being around her, letting herself grow closer, had felt like coming up for air after nearly drowning. It was like she was beginning to piece together the broken pieces of herself, parts she thought would remain shattered forever.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that had scared Agatha. It felt wrong. Like she was erasing the grief, covering it with the happiness she wasn’t sure she deserved. She was scared that allowing herself to feel love again meant she was downplaying Nicky’s death in some way.
    </p>
    <p>
     But now, standing there, on the brink of losing Rio, she knew she couldn’t keep doing this. Mourning for the rest of her life, stuck in memories, wasn’t honouring Nicky at all. Her sweet, sweet boy, so strong, never letting anyone tell him what he couldn’t do. Agatha would do the same. She wouldn’t let her mind tell her that she could never feel happy again. She wouldn’t let herself waste away, trapped in the past. She would let love in. Let Rio in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took a decisive step forward, her breath catching in her throat as her heart pounded in her chest. Every beat felt like a thousand miles a minute, a whirlwind of emotions rushing through her. With a slow, deliberate movement, she pressed her lips to Rio’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     At first, Rio froze, caught off guard by the sudden intimacy. She didn’t pull away, but neither did she react right away. Agatha pulled back slightly, her eyes meeting Rio’s dark ones, searching for something, anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry,” she began, her voice trembling slightly. She gazed into Rio’s eyes, hoping her sincerity could be conveyed through the look in her eyes. She knew sorry wasn’t enough, could never be enough, but she desperately needed Rio to understand how deeply she cared.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ve not been fair to you,” she continued, her voice growing softer, almost reverent. “I want to make it up to you. Stop repressing my-”
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could finish, Rio leaned down again, her lips finding Agatha’s in a slow, tender kiss. The touch was soft, gentle. Unhurried but full of emotion. Agatha let herself sink into it, her eyes closing as her mind finally settled.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were no words needed. The warmth of Rio’s lips against hers was enough. It was everything.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they finally pulled away, their breaths mingling, Agatha couldn’t help but smile softly. She rested her forehead against Rio’s, a feeling of peace washing over her. In that moment, nothing else mattered. Just Rio, just them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, you’ll admit it now?” Rio teased, her smirk growing wider. “Not an accident. Not a ‘lapse of judgment’ or any of that crap? These are real feelings?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled softly, her fingers gently brushing a stray strand of Rio’s dark hair from her face. “Yes, the real thing, I promise,” she whispered. “I’ll stop denying that it's an actual relationship.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow, that familiar smirk slowly spreading across her face. Agatha’s heart fluttered at the sight of it, a small laugh escaping her lips. She had missed that smirk more than she cared to admit in the last hour.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Relationship?” Rio teased, her voice low and playful. “At least take me on a date first! I mean, after all I didn’t get to go on my date tonight, I feel like I deserve some kind of compensation.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed softly, moving her hands to the back of Rio’s neck as her gaze deepened. She met Rio’s playful expression with a raised eyebrow, a smirk of her own slowly forming. “Hmm… tomorrow. Tomorrow we’ll go out. For tonight, I can think of a better kind of compensation.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Rio could respond, Agatha closed the distance between them, capturing her lips in a slow, deliberate kiss. This time, Rio didn’t hold back. She met Agatha’s lips with equal fervor, her hands trailing lightly down Agatha’s arms, pulling her closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     The kiss deepened, warmth and desire flooding the moment. Rio gently pushed Agatha back against the wall, her hands sliding down to rest against the curve of her waist. The intensity of their kiss returned, deeper and more fluid this time, as if they were lost in the rhythm of one another. Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s neck, holding her close as their bodies pressed together, the heat between them palpable.
    </p>
    <p>
     The world seemed to shrink again, leaving just the two of them, a quiet sanctuary in the middle of everything. Rio’s hands moved slowly, exploring the soft fabric against Agatha’s skin, tracing delicate patterns with her fingertips. Agatha let out a soft sigh into the kiss, her breath mingling with Rio’s as they both surrendered to the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     They paused briefly, breathless and smiling, their foreheads resting against one another once again. Agatha’s voice was a soft whisper against Rio’s lips. “You sure know how to make up for lost time,” she murmured, her voice husky with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled, her fingers trailing lightly along Agatha’s jawline. “I aim to please,” she whispered, her voice barely audible.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, their kiss deepened again, slower and more tender, as if savouring every second. The touch of Rio’s lips was soothing, grounding, a reminder that in this moment, everything was exactly as it should be.

     hello my lovelies!! ok, literally all I can say is IM SO SORRY. I AM SO SO INCREDIBLY SORRY! I went on hiatus at literally the worst time when they had JUST gotten together 😭 if i was a reader I would literally be having a seizure so im so sorry to u all !!
    </p>
    <p>
     it has been a very very hard few months. I started this fic as a way to procrastinate studying for my mid-year exams... turns out when u procrastinate u lowkey flop ur exams!! crazy unexpected outcome there ik..
    </p>
    <p>
     that meant that I really couldn't sit down to write or give u guys an update for the last few months bc I was literally too embarrassed to even think ab this fic bc HOW DID I SPEND MONTHS WRITING THIS INSTEAD OF STUDYING?? HELLO?
    </p>
    <p>
     anyways, the embarrassment + shame is over now luckily, and I can actually stomach coming back on ao3 to give yall the update and explanation u deserve! I am very very proud of this fic and am so grateful for the support you have all given me! but unfortunately now I have end-of-year exams coming up, and I fear I cant flop another set of exams bc of this fic 😭😭
    </p>
    <p>
     THAT DOESNT MEAN THERES NOT GONNA BE AN END! I still plan to write at least 1 or 2 more chapters, they just may take a few more weeks/months! I'm sorry I cant give u a more definitive date, but I dont wanna say its gonna be till after my exams bc maybe i'll end up writing sooner... I honestly don't know, but as I hope i've established in my notes and in the fic itself, I am a nerd and I love neuroscience more than anything, and I love learning, so I really have to prioritise school and put my academics first!! I hope this makes sense to u all, and I hope it can provide some releif that i'm definitely coming back at some point, it just may not be for a while!
    </p>
    <p>
     love love love you all and thank you for all your sweet comments, I hope u guys aren't too annoyed lmao &lt;33
