<p>“It’s my wife and kid we’re talking about–”</p>
<p>“Ex.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, a certain pain lingering behind the aqua. “Ex wife, Rio. I’m your ex wife, you're my ex wife.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>They met in 2007 at a bar after Rio had just gotten off an absolutely hellish shift at the hospital. She had walked in for the cheap drinks, being a resident meant she never had <i>any</i> money. Her student loan debt alone was enough to make her question why she decided to become a doctor. Rio smoothed out her black muscle tank and jeans as she found a stool at the bar. It was a random Tuesday night, the patrons few and far between. She ordered her usual, a god awful $4 beer, and alternated between sipping and anxiously peeling at the label.</p><p>“Surgeon?” A raspy voice asked, the scent of iris and amber enveloping her senses.</p><p>Rio whipped around, taking in the owner of the voice. A woman, probably not much younger than Rio. Wild waves cascading down to her stomach, sly quirk of full lips, eyes that resembled aquamarine with pale green right around the pupil. Her nose alone had Rio smiling back. The woman was holding a drink, low rise jeans showing off a sliver of lower stomach where her green baby tee ended.</p><p>“Uh-” Rio cleared her throat, “Yeah. How’d you know?”</p><p>The other woman climbed onto the stool next to her. “Other than the fact that this is the closest bar to Mass Gen, your hands.”</p><p>“My hands?”</p><p>“Your fingers, specifically.”</p><p>“You were staring at my fingers?”</p><p>“Well,” She tilted her head, blush coating her cheeks, aquamarine glinting with mischief. “If it makes you feel better I was also staring at your ass.”</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue against her cheek, grinning. “I’m sitting down.”</p><p>“So you should be flattered by my effort.”</p><p><i>Okay, she’s a spitfire</i>, Rio thought. “What about my fingers?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“What about my fingers made you decide I was a surgeon.”</p><p>She tutted her tongue against her teeth, sliding her free hand across the lacquered wood of the bar, her index finger barely brushing against the back of Rio’s hand.</p><p>“The way they moved.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Slow. Methodical. Attentive.”</p><p>“It’s a sticker off a beer bottle.”</p><p>“And yet every piece has been taken off in precise, uniform detail.” She pointed to the pieces of damp paper on the bar, all the same shape and size to a fault. “So it was either surgeon or serial killer.”</p><p>“I could be both.”</p><p>“Doubt it.”</p><p>“”Why’s that?”</p><p>“Your eyes are too kind.” She quipped, finger now idly tracing the back of Rio’s hand. “My guess is something with kids, right? You seem like the type of nerd to give them a dino toy when they’ve been brave.”</p><p>Rio blinked a few times, bewildered, because that’s <i>exactly</i> the type of nerd she was. “Do you work at the hospital?” Though she would kick herself if she had been in proximity to this gorgeous and interesting of a woman and never noticed.</p><p>The fucking siren in front of her snorted and Rio considered it one of the most beautiful sounds to ever grace her eardrums. “No, god no. I’m a teacher.”</p><p>“So you’re also the type of nerd that works with kids?”</p><p>“Technically, but I teach high school English.” Her smile only got wider. “I only come here to troll for hot, rich doctors.”</p><p>Rio sighed. “Then you picked the wrong one. I’m poor, embarrassingly so.”</p><p>“Who said I picked you?”</p><p>“So you just watched my hands and my ass for no reason?”</p><p>“Well you’re not loaded, so yeah, apparently.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “You’re quick.”</p><p>“No, I’m Agatha.” She let her finger drop to Rio’s wrist right over her pulse point. “And your name?”</p><p>“Why do you wanna know it?”</p><p>“It’s usually courtesy to have someone’s legal name before screaming it in bed,” She fully turned her body towards Rio’s. “But I can always just shout out random ones if you’d prefer. Like Dani or JJ,” She studied Rio for a bit longer, half guessing and half joking. “Ana?”</p><p>Rio’s face flushed, her chest felt warm. “You hit on all your women by calling them what I am assuming are your ex’s names?”</p><p>“Only the ones who make me work for it.” She raised a single eyebrow in a challenge.</p><p>“You don’t even know if I’m into women.”</p><p>“You’re looking awfully nervous for a straight girl.” Her stare raked over Rio’s body, studying her. “The tattoos on your arm and the Docs don’t help your case either.”</p><p>Rio had a sleeve on her arm, mostly vines with flowers woven throughout. It was Boston so most hospitals didn’t care if their doctors were tatted, and on the rare occasion where she had to cover them, she just wore a long sleeve under her scrub top or her white coat on top.</p><p>Yeah, also a reason she never had any fucking money.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>She swiveled her stool, her body now facing Agatha. “Rio.”</p><p>“De Janeiro…?”</p><p>“No, my name. It’s Rio.”</p><p>“Mmmmh.” She contently hummed, gaze locking in on hers. “Dr. Rio.”</p><p>“Dr. Vidal.” Rio corrected, “Pediatrics.”</p><p>“Knew it.” Agatha huffed, rolling her eyes. “Nerd.”</p><p>The confidence, the razzing, the way this woman carried herself–</p><p>Angels don’t exist, signs from the universe are lies people tell themselves, there is no magic number that someone can wish on and get everything they've ever wanted. Rio knew that, but looking at those two pools of pale blue, she almost wished she didn’t.</p><p>“Mrs. Agatha.” Rio shot back, grinning and taking a sip of her beer.</p><p>“<i>Miss</i> Harkness.” She emphasized the part of her name that let Rio know she wasn’t married. “But let’s not distract ourselves with formalities.”</p><p>“Oh? What should we distract ourselves with?”</p><p>Agatha suddenly stood, leaning down to whisper into her ear. “With the fact that I’m going to go to the bathroom, and maybe I forget to lock the door.”</p><p>She looked up at her, at the woman who looked like she was going to eat Rio whole, and gave a dazed nod. She watched as Agatha walked away, the sway of her hips, the swell of her ass in those fucking jeans.</p><p>A beat later, Rio got up, walking down the compact hallway and reaching the door to one of two bathrooms. Both single stall, both with lockable doors. It’s like they were asking people to fuck in them, that’s how Rio reasoned it anyway.</p><p>June 2nd, 2007, Rio met her wife. She didn’t realize it at the time, she didn’t get Agatha’s info after shoving those very methodical fingers into her jeans while the other woman moaned as she sat atop the sink. No, it wasn’t until a few weeks later, when Rio went back to that bar after another long shift, that Agatha waltzed in a few minutes after.</p><p>Lucky four leaf clovers and wish-granting shooting stars are made up ideas sold by con men, but Rio could live with that if it meant fate brought them both back to that shabby hole in the wall bar at the same time, on the same night. And yes, Rio got her number that time, taking her out on their first date the following week.</p><p>They got married on June 2nd, 2010.</p><p>They bought their home in 2011.</p><p>They had their daughter in 2012.</p><p>Yeah, the universe did not work in mysterious ways, Rio knew that as a medical professional. Nobody’s life is saved by a higher power, it’s saved by science and professional training.</p><p>However, she could overlook that for her wife and daughter, for the milestones. For the memories of a pregnant and miserable Agatha choosing a color scheme for the nursery and Rio building all the furniture. Their daughter being born happy and healthy at the same hospital Rio was now an attending at, the smiles and the tears as they held Nicky for the first time. Rio falling asleep with Nicky on her chest during late night feedings and diaper changes. Agatha helping her toddle over the hardwood floors of their townhome near downtown and take her first steps. Rio helping her to learn how to ride a bike with the residual ice and sleet of a late Boston spring. The birthdays, the anniversaries, the promotions and good grades.</p><p>Rio let herself believe in fate for that part of her life, foolishly apparently.</p><p>They finalized their divorce in 2022.</p><p>She remembers signing the paperwork, the ink spilling out the tip of the pen and ending her marriage in a broad stroke. Fifteen years together, twelve married, thirteen where they were happy, and one kid. And a dotted line just undid it all.</p><p>Agatha kept the townhouse, Rio got a nice loft near the hospital. They split custody of their daughter, who hated them and the back and forth, and Rio really couldn’t fault her for it. They alternated weeks and holidays, they were cordial enough. On the outside looking in, they were amicable. And even if it did kill Rio on the inside, Agatha told her they were done, so she respected her wishes.</p><p>They never truly felt over, even in the three years since the divorce, Rio still wore her wedding ring. She’d gone out on a few dates, but nothing compared in her mind, nobody ever would. And it made her feel pathetic, because while Rio pined from a distance, her ex wife (which she despised that ‘ex’ part of ‘wife’ with every fiber of her being) dated and went out and lived her life.</p><p>There had been a few steady girlfriends, all of which Rio wanted to violently murder but didn’t out of respect for Agatha and their child. The inbetween, the post-break up eras is where Rio thrived. 	Where she’d drop Nicky off at her former home and be able to look at Agatha and just <i>know</i> she’d get a call the second their daughter left to hangout with friends or for her tutoring gig. Where Rio would come over and pin her ex wife to the nearest wall, ruminate in the familiar taste of Agatha’s lips, cherish the feeling of Agatha’s soft skin beneath her hand, fucking memorize the sounds Agatha made as she came around Rio’s fingers or tongue or strap.</p><p>Fifteen years hadn’t been long enough, she needed more and Rio would take it however she could get it. Even if it meant only being a warm body for the meantime, even if it meant leaving at Agatha’s word so Nicky wouldn’t catch them and get confused.</p><p>And Rio understood, she didn’t blame Agatha for ending things, not after everything that happened. Things she couldn’t take back. She hoped that time would heal the wound, the one they both shared, the child they lost. But it didn’t, so Rio focused on the child they did have, she focused on her career despite the part it played in ending her marriage. She worked more and more hours when they were separated, before the custody arrangement had been finalized. Rio basically lived in that on-call room more than any other doctor in that fucking hospital.</p><p>Now, three years had passed since Rio signed that stupid fucking dotted line, and she was worse off. She had friends, though they were also Agatha’s, lesbians and their tight knit friends were a curse. She had hobbies, she had her garden, she had her daughter two weeks a month. But she didn’t have her wife– dammit, ex wife. Three years and she still made that mistake, still felt wrong when another woman hit on her, still recoiled at being touched in a way that only Agatha had done for fifteen years.</p><p>Her and Agatha were off currently, she hadn’t gotten a booty call in well over six months. Some ginger chick that Agatha had been seeing, according to Nicky the woman was nice enough, kind of pretty. Rio wanted to ply her daughter for more information but knew it’d get back to her ex if she did, so she left it alone and waited for Agatha to call.</p><p>Because she always did.</p><p>No matter how long it had been, or who she had just been with, Rio always came back when Agatha needed her. And not to pat herself on the shoulder, but Rio was pretty confident no other woman could fuck her wife like she could. Their sex life had vanished in their last couple years of marriage, but once those papers were filed, something clicked back again. Which, thank god because she had missed throwing her wife around like a rag doll and eating her out until her legs involuntarily shook. It wasn’t exactly the same as before. The sex was more detached and Agatha never let Rio see or feel her abdomen. She’d always wear some sort of shirt that’d never leave her body because she didn’t want Rio to look at or touch the angry scar on her lower stomach. Which Rio lived with. She had learned to live with a lot. So, Agatha could have her fun, because Rio never truly worried that another could take her ex.</p><p>Until their daughter’s 13th birthday party, held at that same fucking towhome. It was Saturday in early September, she came bearing cake as was her responsibility according to her ex. She still had a key so she let herself in, baggy blue jeans sitting low on her waist, a tight heather gray tank adorning her torso. Her hair was pulled back into a messy bun, having chopped it last month because at forty-five years old, she didn’t want to fucking deal with it anymore. And if her tattoos were on full display and she had forgone a bra, who would notice?</p><p>Agatha, hopefully.</p><p>She made her way through the house, Agatha had redecorated a few things over the years, but ultimately it was mainly the same. She made idle chitchat with their shared acquaintances before grabbing a beer and heading out to the deck, her daughter bounding up to her.</p><p>“Mami!”</p><p>Rio opened her arms as their bodies collided, smiling against the crown of her daughter’s head. “Hey, teddy.”</p><p>“I missed you.” Nicky spoke, squeezing Rio tight, face pressed into her shoulder.</p><p>Rio pulled back, looking down fractionally because Nicky had shot up over the summer like a fucking weed. “I missed you too, but you saw me Sunday.”</p><p>Monday to Sunday was their routine, tomorrow night Rio would pick Nicky up and take her back to the loft. Not perfect but it was the best they could do with what they had done to their life.</p><p>“Mom’s looking for you.”</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Rio didn’t ask why, her eyes fell to her daughter’s neck, her fingers plucking the dainty gold chain and accompanying stone. “¿Qué es esto?”</p><p>Nicky didn’t wear dainty, overly feminine jewelry. Wherever this came from, it didn’t scream her daughter’s vibe. Nicky still wore Rio’s old Paramore shirts, the one from their Riot or Brand New Eyes era, claiming they were “vintage”. Which yes, made Rio feel ancient. Nicky wore ripped jeans and thrifted band tees, not preppy princess bullshit. Not that it would be a bad thing if she did, they’d support Nicky no matter how she dressed. But Rio had to admit, her daughter was stupid fucking cool. It looked to be real gold with a sapphire pendent, Nicky’s birthstone. Her and Agatha had a general rule of not buying their kid expensive gifts since Rio heavily out earned her ex financially.</p><p>“Wanda me lo dio.” Nicky scoffed, rolling her huge brown doe eyes.</p><p>“Wanda?” She scrunched her face, “Who the fuck is–”</p><p>“Rio!” Alice’s voice called from where her and the rest of the gang sat in the backyard. “How the hell are you here? Thought you were in surgery?”</p><p>“And miss my daughter’s birthday? No fucking way.” Rio shouted across the way, a few guests turning their heads.</p><p>“Language, please.” Lilia, who for all intents and purposes was Agatha’s mom, scolded. “My grandchild is thirteen, not twenty.”</p><p>“I know the word ‘fuck’, nona.” Nicky called over to the table before looking back at Rio. “I think it quite a lot around <i>that woman</i>.”</p><p>“Nicola Camila Vidal...” Lilia warned.</p><p>Rio scrunched her face. “What woman?”</p><p>“Wanda!”</p><p>“Who is Wanda?!”</p><p>Her ex wife’s voice bellowed from behind her. “My girlfriend.”</p><p>Rio whipped around, and Agatha looked beautiful, she always did. She was carrying the cake, fingers bare of a wedding ring unlike Rio’s. She stood with an annoyed expression on her face, a simple blue sun dress on her frame. And yes, they were celebrating their daughter’s birthday, and yes, they were divorced. But if she still had Agatha, if she still had her perfect life, Rio’s head would currently be under that dress.</p><p>Instead of dropping to her knees on the deck that she fucking built herself in front of their friends, Rio swallowed and quirked her eyebrow. “Since when?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes the same way she did in that bar eighteen years ago. “Help me with the cake.” She hissed before turning around and heading back into the house and into the kitchen.</p><p>Rio followed, knowing damn well her ex did not need help with the cake, closing the sliding glass door behind her. The kitchen was empty as Agatha stood at the island, very aggressively sticking candles into the cake.</p><p>“I told you <i>months ago</i> I was dating someone.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, approaching the opposite side of the island. “I didn't think it was serious enough that she was giving my daughter presents.”</p><p>“You think I would bring a complete stranger around Nicky?”</p><p>“I just–” Rio sighed, setting her beer down on the counter. “I figured it’d fizzle out, it always does.”</p><p>Agatha peered up from her task like she was attempting to murder Rio with just a glare. “Thanks.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean it like that.” She explained, “I meant that neither of us has had a serious partner since…everything.”</p><p>“Well, I do.”</p><p>“So where is she?” Rio waved her arms around, challenging a non-existent woman. “I don’t see Big Red anywhere.”</p><p>Rio could only insult the woman so much with the very little info she had on her.</p><p>“Not here yet, we went out to dinner with Nicky last night because I don’t trust you to meet her.”</p><p>“Why’s that?”</p><p>“Because,” Agatha gripped onto the side of the counter, shoulders tensing. “I know that you’d probably try to scare her off.”</p><p>“That’s not true.”</p><p>It was.</p><p>“Rio, you don’t date. You don’t go out. You work and take care of Nicky.”</p><p>“How do you know that?”</p><p>“Our daughter isn’t stupid, she knows you’re lonely.” Agatha tilted her head. “And I didn’t think it’d be good for her if I rubbed salt in your wound. Maturity and all that bullshit.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t lonely, she was perfectly content beside the constant ache in her chest for her old life back.</p><p>“How long has this been going on?”</p><p>“Nicky’s worrying or Wanda?”</p><p>“Wanda. Nicky doesn’t need to worry about me, I’m fine.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look convinced at that last part, but she answered anyway. “Nine months, almost ten?”</p><p>“Nine?” Rio cocked her head, “No, because it was a few days after Valentine’s day when you called me and we–”</p><p>“I know.” She interrupted, not wanting to rehash the night they spent fucking a few days after Valentine’s of all holidays. “We weren’t exclusive then.”</p><p>“That’s so funny,” Rio smirked, deciding to pick at the issue until it was raw. “‘Cause I distinctly remember you saying something along the lines of me being the best you’ve ever had while you were sitting on my face. And come to find out, you had another woman on the side.”</p><p>“She wasn’t on the side!” Agatha snapped. “You were! It was a moment of weakness that, believe me, will not happen again.”</p><p>Her gut twisted at being the other woman to Agatha, the placeholder.</p><p>“Oh, I’ve heard that one before.” She bitterly chuckled. “What makes this time so different?”</p><p>“It’s serious, it’s- it’s more.” Agatha looked directly into her eyes as she verbally slit Rio's throat. “We talk about marriage, about the future.”</p><p>Goal achieved because Rio’s windpipe constricted, her wife never failing to say the exact right thing to break Rio down into pieces that she’d promptly stomp on. “Marriage?”</p><p>“Yup.” Agatha sighed.</p><p>“You’d get remarried?”</p><p>“Maybe.” She shrugged noncommittally. “If she asked.”</p><p>“Then I want to meet her.”</p><p>“Rio–”</p><p>“You’re telling me this woman could be another parent to my kid and I don’t deserve to meet her?!” Rio nearly shouted, and though it appeared as rage, it was nothing more than anguish.</p><p>Agatha gently shook her head, giving up. “She’ll be here in an hour. But you have to promise me to behave yourself.”</p><p>“What do you think I’ll do?”</p><p>“Hit her?” Agatha almost grinned, “Mark your territory and intimidate her?”</p><p>“It’s my wife and kid we’re talking about–”</p><p>“Ex.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, a certain pain lingering behind the aqua. “Ex wife, Rio. I’m your ex wife, you're my ex wife.”</p><p>“I said that.”</p><p>“No,” She blew out a tired breath. “You didn’t.”</p><p>“Does Wanda know we had sex while you two were together?”</p><p>“No, and she doesn’t need to.” Agatha picked up a lighter, setting the wicks of the candles aflame. “Last thing I need is her thinking you still have a shot with me.”</p><p>Her eyes went glassy, quickly blinking back the tears. “Right.”</p><p>“Let’s just focus on Nicky today, hm? Soon she’ll be a full fledged teenager who hates and resents us.”</p><p>“She already resents us.”</p><p>“Builds character.” Agatha huffed, picking up the cake again and making her way back to the door. “Can you open the door?”</p><p>Rio walked over, body next to Agatha’s as she undid the latch of the handle. “The track needs some WD-40, it’s sticking.”</p><p>“I’ll buy some.”</p><p>Rio tugged, the door barely moving. “I can bring some over when I pick up Nicky tomorrow.” She angled her body, stepping into Agatha’s personal space as her ex lifted the cake out of Rio’s way. “It’s just–”</p><p>“Sticking, I know.”</p><p>Rio looked up from the handle and was unaware until that current moment just <i>how</i> close they were. Her face a breath away from Agatha’s. “I can, um, I can fix it…tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha’s pupils dilated and Rio could hear her swallow before speaking. “So you’ve said.”</p><p>The door was glass, so everyone outside could currently see them, but it wasn’t like they were doing anything inappropriate. It’s not like Rio was leaning in further and Agatha was letting her, or that the amount of eye contact being shared was completely unnecessary…</p><p>No, of course not.</p><p>Rio half-heartedly pulled again, barely using any strength as her gaze stayed on her wife. “I think we’re trapped.”</p><p>“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” Agatha smirked.</p><p>“I–”</p><p>A set of footsteps entered the room, a casual voice following. “What’s going on here?”</p><p>They both whipped their heads over, Agatha taking a few steps back. “Wanda.”</p><p>The woman wasn’t kind of pretty like Nicky said, she was gorgeous.</p><p>And the complete opposite of Rio.</p><p>Where Rio opted for masculine clothing, hard lines and dark colors, Wanda went the other way. She stood in the foyer with her red hair down and curled, not an eyelash out of fucking place. She had on a pair of jeans that looked to be vintage, white linen blouse and heeled boots to finish the ensemble. Rio buffered as she stared at the woman, suddenly the pretty princess bullshit Nicky was currently wearing made sense.</p><p>Wanda smiled, setting her designer handbag down on the counter as she walked over to them.</p><p>“I- I thought you weren’t coming until later.” Agatha stumbled over her words.</p><p>“My meeting got done early, thought I’d surprise you and the birthday girl.”</p><p>Yeah, her daughter had mentioned Wanda was some marketing executive or something. That made Rio seethe because Wanda couldn’t have been more than thirty-five, and here she was, wildly successful.</p><p>“Hon, this is Rio.” Agatha tilted her head towards Rio, “My ex.”</p><p>Wanda extended her hand, long acrylics perfectly manicured, her tone cheery. “I’ve heard so much about you from Nic, it’s good to finally cross paths.”</p><p>
<i>Nic?</i>
</p><p>Oh, this fucking bitch.</p><p>Rio kept her grip on the handle, giving a disingenuous smile. “You too, kinda have my hands full.”</p><p>“Do you want me to try?” Wanda offered.</p><p>As if Rio would let her, using the rage she had currently bubbling inside her body, Rio yanked the damn thing again with all her strength. Finally, it budged, sliding down the track.</p><p>Rio bit back a snide laugh, giving them both one last glance before heading back out onto the deck.</p><p>“I got it. Thanks.”</p><p>Motherfucking ginger cockblock.</p>

<p>The rest of Nicky’s party went fine. They sang Happy Birthday and had cake, Nicky opened presents, Rio kept her mouth shut. Agatha really only cared that Nicky had a good time, so long as her child was happy. The party wrapped up, leaving Wanda, Nicky, Rio, Lilia, and herself.</p><p>Agatha began cleaning up, Rio and Wanda helping and actively avoiding one another at all costs. Nicky was with Lilia in the kitchen starting dinner, her daughter’s one request was to have her nona cook her famous Busiate alla Trapanese. Agatha wasn’t much of a cook, never had been. She had a few dishes she could do well and rotated them often, Rio was the chef between the two of them and her daughter never let her forget that fact. Especially when they had first separated and Nicky would complain about how much she missed her mami’s cooking.</p><p>So Agatha obviously agreed to a family dinner when Nicky had asked, except–</p><p>“Can mami stay for dinner?” Nicky asked as she stood next to Lilia by the stove, weaponizing those damn puppydog eyes she got from Rio.</p><p>“Teddy, I don’t know if she can stay–” Agatha said, tossing paper plates into the trash.</p><p>“I can stay.” Rio spoke, coming in from the deck with a garbage bag full of wrapping paper.</p><p>“There might not be enough food,” Agatha flitted her eyes over to her mom, screaming silently for help. “Right, ma?”</p><p>Lilia looked at her, knowing exactly what she was trying to do and smiling. “I’m Sicilian, of course there's enough food.” She then looked at Agatha’s ex. “I don’t see you nearly as much as I’d like to anymore, stay.”</p><p>Her ex grinned victoriously. “You’re too kind, Lilia.”</p><p>“Okay, I think that’s all the streamers.” Wanda announced as she stepped inside, hands full of colorful paper. “No sea turtles choking on my watch.”</p><p>“I wish <i>you</i> would.” Nicky muttered under her breath, causing Lilia to lightly elbow her.</p><p>“Nicola.” Lilia whispered in a warning.</p><p>“What?” She shrugged, stirring whatever her nona had told her to.</p><p>“Um, Rio’s going to stay for dinner.” Agatha looked at her girlfriend, who was trying and failing so miserably to fit in.</p><p>Wanda discarded the streamers, giving a diplomatic smile. “Great.”</p><p>Rio seemed to be annoyed at the very thought of Wanda breathing, looking at Agatha. “You got any wine?”</p><p>Oh right, alcohol!</p><p>Invented for situations just like this one.</p><p>“Yes, thank fucking god.” Agatha mumbled, bolting to the fridge and grabbing a bottle. “How many glasses?”</p><p>Yeah, every adult in the room agreed to wine.</p><p>No surprise there.</p><p>Lilia and Nicky finished cooking while Agatha, Wanda, and Rio all retired to the dining room. Wanda set her glass on the table and sat down, Agatha placing down her own reaching for the chair next to her girlfriend. As she did so, a hand shot out, pulling out the chair for her. Agatha paused, licking her lower lip as she looked at Rio who simply just stood waiting.</p><p>“Old habits.” Rio chirped.</p><p>Yeah, Rio always did shit like that. Held the door open, used her own jacket as a makeshift umbrella for Agatha whenever it rained, pulled out the chair for her at the table. Yes, Agatha had married a gentleman once upon a time, and Rio would never let her fucking forget it.</p><p>Agatha glared, but sat down as Rio pushed in the chair for her. “Thanks.”</p><p>Rio took the chair opposite Agatha, gingerly sipping her drink, copper eyes flitting between the two. “So how’d you guys meet?”</p><p>Wanda perked up. “Oh, uh at a bar actually. New Year’s eve.”</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue against the side of her cheek, a mannerism that their daughter inherited. “No way, us too.” She waved her finger between herself and Agatha.</p><p>“Yeah,” Wanda nodded, “She just saw me and went for it. Very brazenly, I might add.”</p><p>“Ahhh,” Her ex agreed, “She’s brazen, this one.”</p><p>And Agatha knew what Rio was doing, trying to get under her skin. Making polite conversation with her girlfriend who Agatha was aware Rio already despised. She knew her ex’s tones like the back of her fucking hand, and this one was the fakest in her repertoire.</p><p>“Anyway…” Agatha said, attempting to shift the conversation.</p><p>“Did she pull the bathroom move?” Rio raised her eyebrows.</p><p>“Fucks sake.” She hissed, staring daggers at her ex wife across the table. “Could you not?”</p><p>“Bathroom move?” Wanda echoed.</p><p>“Ya know, maybe she goes to the bathroom and ‘forgets’ to lock the door.” Rio explained, wine in one hand. Sure, she’d had one beer during the party, but Rio wasn’t a lightweight, she wasn’t drunk or even tipsy. She was just being a dick. “I lost track of  the amount of times she did that while we were married. It’s a miracle we’re not banned from most public places in Boston.”</p><p>“Um, no…?” Wanda responded, she turned her head to Agatha in confusion. “Am I missing something?”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio widened her eyes dramatically. “You’re missing <i>a lot</i>.”</p><p>“That’s enough.” Agatha declared, “And not helpful.”</p><p>Rio didn’t need to know the details of how Agatha and Wanda came to be, or when they fucked, or how they fucked. It wasn’t her place, and Agatha would remind her of that every chance she got.</p><p>Sure, her and Wanda’s sex life wasn’t as great as her and Rio’s is–</p><p>Was.</p><p>But it didn’t mean it was bad, it was fine.</p><p>“Did you two spend Valentine’s together?” Rio continued, taking another sip.</p><p>Agatha felt her blood pressure skyrocket, the silent insinuation dangling between the three of them.</p><p>“Yeah,” Wanda said, “We went to Yvonne’s over on Winter Ave.”</p><p>“Swanky.” Rio nodded, “Good food?”</p><p>“Oh my god, it was delicious.” Wanda replied, trying to engage in a seemingly safe topic of conversation. “We were both stuffed afterwards.”</p><p>“Something tells me Agatha wasn’t….” Rio muttered against the rim of her glass.</p><p>“Hmm?” Wanda furrowed her brows, not having caught it.</p><p>But Agatha did.</p><p>“Rio, kitchen.” Agatha barked, standing up from the table. “Now.”</p><p>Rio pursed her lips, beginning to get up. “Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>As soon as she was in close enough range, Agatha grabbed her by the wrist and yanked her out of the room. She completely bypassed the kitchen where her mom and daughter were, instead shoving her into the bathroom off the den.</p><p>She locked the door, whipping around to face her ex. “What the fuck is your problem?!”</p><p>Rio pointed at the lock. “Look at that, you remembered this time!”</p><p>“Can you just not be a total asshole for one evening?”</p><p>“I thought I was being nice.”</p><p>“You were antagonizing her.”</p><p>“Not my fault she’s too dumb to recognize that.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath before lashing out and strangling Rio, mostly because she knew her ex would fucking love it if she did.</p><p>“For our daughter’s sake, can you please just play nice?”</p><p>“Our daughter’s sake? Nicky doesn’t like her either!”</p><p>“And she never will if you keep trying to start a pissing contest!”</p><p>“Please, like ginger spice could compete…”</p><p>“See! Shit like that is not going to foster a good relationship between the two of them.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “Oh no.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha took a step closer. “We are over. I know that’s hard for you to comprehend but I am not a prize to be won or an object to be owned. We are both free to do whatever we want with whoever we want.”</p><p>“And you want <i>her?</i>”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Wanda was sweet, caring, and funny enough. She was intelligent enough that Agatha wouldn’t get bored, she had a good job, she put in effort with Nicky. On paper, Wanda was perfect. And most importantly, <i>not</i> Rio.</p><p>“Just answer me one thing, and I’ll drop it.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, far from convinced she would drop anything. “What?”</p><p>Rio licked her bottom lip before her lips curled up into a sinister smile. “When did you become a top?”</p><p>She reared her head back as though she had been punched square in the face. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“I saw her nails.”</p><p>“Plenty of queer women have long nails.”</p><p>“Yeah, but like, <i>all</i> of her nails were long…”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“So, if my memory serves me correctly you’re a taker.” Rio pointed past her, referring to the woman currently waiting at the table. “And she sure as shit is not a giver.”</p><p>Yeah, because Agatha didn’t feel comfortable being that vulnerable with anyone but her ex. Despite the fact that she was hellbent on her and Rio never fucking again, Agatha knew she’d never have that trust with someone else. Because Rio took care of Agatha in a way that another person couldn’t. Some connection, some bond that no matter how hard she tried, never broke.</p><p>“Maybe you don’t know me as well anymore.”</p><p>Rio didn’t even blink, just chuckled. “Baby, we both know that’s a lie.”</p><p>She ignored her heart skipping a beat at the pet name, keeping her face neutral. This was so much easier when she could just get her way by batting her eyelashes or flashing her tits and making Rio’s brain go blank.</p><p>But that was no longer an option, so words it was.</p><p>“Just be civil, just for today. That’s all I’m asking.”</p><p>“I haven’t hit her, have I?”</p><p>“Yes, but it’s very clear you’d like to.”</p><p>“Sue me.”</p><p>“I did.” Agatha smiled knowingly. “Took half of everything you own.”</p><p>Not that it had been difficult. Throughout the entire process of their divorce, Rio had responded to every negotiation with “Give her whatever she wants.”</p><p>Not that Agatha wanted a lot, she didn’t marry Rio for her money or lack thereof when they first met. Hell, Agatha had even refused spousal support. The only money she actually received was monthly child support and that was because she made peanuts compared to her ex. The public education system, may god bless it, did not pay its teachers well. Barely enough to live, actually.</p><p>“You could’ve kept everything I own.” Rio said quietly. “Could’ve kept me.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath constricted in her ribcage, acting as a ribbon caught on bone. “I didn’t act alone.”</p><p>Rio’s face fell at the accusation, because even if Agatha was the one to serve Rio the papers, there were two people at fault for the end of their marriage. Not that their daughter saw it that way, however. No, Nicky resolutely saw Agatha as the one who broke up the family and Rio as the victim. It’s why she worried so much, it’s why she hated Wanda, it’s why she had distanced herself from Agatha ever since the divorce. And yeah, it had crushed her to lose one child physically and another emotionally in the span of a couple of years. But she told Rio they were done, and her ex just…listened.</p><p>So now they stood in front of one another, in the bathroom of their once shared home, fighting. Fighting about Wanda and petty shit because this was their reality now. But Agatha wouldn’t go back, she couldn’t.</p><p>“I know.” Rio’s voice was gentle. “I know.”</p><p>“Then don’t blame me when you fucking know.” Agatha bit out, refusing to let tears well. “I get enough of that from my mom and our daughter.”</p><p>“Lilia?”</p><p>She definitely wasn’t fucking referring to Evanora.</p><p>“Please, do you think I ever heard the end of it with her?” She bit her trembling lip. “Everyone pities you and hates me. I don’t need you making this any harder than it already is.”</p><p>“Lilia and Nicky don’t hate you. They would never.”</p><p>“You know Nicky doesn’t even hug me anymore?” Agatha’s voice broke. “She doesn’t look at me the same way. You’re her hero and I’m the villain.”</p><p>When Nicky had just ran up to Rio today the minute she saw her? It cut. It fucking bruised. To see her daughter overcome with so much relief and joy at the sight of her ex, only to sigh and scoff around her. To know that she blamed Agatha for everything wrong in her life and see her as evil, when she had worked so fucking hard to ensure her daughter would see her as anything but. Especially after what her own mother put her through, especially after her own childhood.</p><p>“Agatha–” Rio’s eyes went soft with sympathy.</p><p>Wanda never looked at her like that, and she was so fucking grateful for it. It was easy with Wanda, no baggage or painful past. When Wanda looked at Agatha, she saw <i>Agatha.</i> When Rio looked at Agatha, Rio saw the past eighteen years. And though most of it had been fucking amazing, the bad parts just hurt too much.</p><p>She sniffled, uninterested in receiving Rio’s comfort. “So, please. Just be fucking cordial.”</p><p>Rio nodded, surrendering the fight. “Okay.”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha breathed out, turning and opening the door. She hastily wiped her eyes, ignoring the pain in her chest. She stopped in the kitchen when Lilia announced dinner was ready, offering to carry one of the many dishes to the table.</p><p>Rio followed behind with plates and cutlery, Lilia and Nicky in tow with the last of the food. Once everyone was seated and the meal was laid out, the conversation flowed well enough. Lilia asked Nicky about summer camp, Rio and Agatha talked about work.</p><p>“Eighth grade good so far, teddy?” Rio grinned at their daughter who had opted to sit next to her.</p><p>“My English teacher is a moron, but besides that…”</p><p>“Well, that’s because we raised you to be pretentious about literature.” Agatha snorted. “Probably my fault.”</p><p>“Isn’t it always.” Nicky looked down at her plate, absently pushing the pasta around.</p><p>Having a teenage daughter was <i>so fun</i>.</p><p>“Mija.” Rio’s voice went serious, but not unkind. “Apologize.”</p><p>Her daughter rolled her eyes, briefly peeking up at Agatha. “Sorry, mom.”</p><p>“You can do better than that.” Rio spoke, “Like you mean it.”</p><p>Nicky fully looked up, eyes on Agatha. “I’m sorry for saying that, mom. It was disrespectful."</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha said, moving on for now. “What don’t you like about your English teacher?”</p><p>“The assigned reading is all men, and I know he was able to make it himself because it’s not dictated by the curriculum! He just chose all men!”</p><p>“Did you ask him about it?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Of course I did.”</p><p>“And what’d he say?” Rio prompted.</p><p>“That I can read whatever I’d like in my spare time, but as far as he’s concerned, the list isn’t changing.”</p><p>“Oh, so he is a prick.” Agatha set down her fork. “Great call on that one, teddy.”</p><p>“What’s teddy?” Her girlfriend’s voice broke through. Oh fuck, that’s right. Wanda was here. “You guys use it so often but I’m not actually sure what it means.”</p><p>Rio smiled, nostalgia washing over. “Uh, when Nicky was little, she was a clinger.”</p><p>Agatha’s own smile matched her ex’s. “She used to get so tired after running around that when you picked her up, she’d snuggle one of us immediately. Her chubby little hands would grab our hair and she’d tuck her face against our necks. She’d just burrow like–”</p><p>“A teddy bear.” Rio finished, eyes misting. “The name just stuck.”</p><p>“One time, she fell asleep while Rio was giving her a piggyback ride to the car.” Agatha lightly chuckled. “We kept bickering over where we had parked.”</p><p>“I thought it was row B, Agatha thought it was row F.” Rio supplied.</p><p>“Turns out, it was row D.” Nicky added, “And it was Disneyland, that was a big day for five year old me.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips at the memory of that vacation. “You looked so cute in your mouse ears meeting Captain Hook.”</p><p>“Captain Hook?” Wanda giggled. “Not Tinkerbell or Cinderella?”</p><p>“I don’t care much for bimbos.” Nicky snarked, mean-mugging Wanda. “Fictious or real.”</p><p>“Who the hell taught you the word bimbo?” Lilia gawked.</p><p>“Bigger issue, ma.” Agatha held up her hand to dismiss her mom. “Don’t say that to people, especially women, and especially not to Wanda.”</p><p>At that, Nicky groaned, standing from the table. “All I wanted was a <i>family</i> dinner!” She then pointed at Wanda. “She’s not family.” Nicky finished her outburst by fisting a hand around the chain of the necklace that Wanda had gifted her, and tugging. The chain broke free from her neck before she carelessly dropped it onto the table.</p><p>“Nicky–” Agatha stood.</p><p>“Mija–” Rio stood too.</p><p>“Don’t bother.” Their daughter huffed, turning on her heel. “I’m already going.”</p><p>The clunky boots Nicky always wore stomped off and up the stairs, the finale being the slamming of her bedroom door.</p><p>The silence following could've been sliced with a fucking machete, nobody saying a word. Rio’s copper locked onto Agatha, an understanding passing between the two of them. Agatha quickly ducked down to Wanda, “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“Should I go?” Wanda asked like she had done something wrong.</p><p>“No, we’ll handle it.”</p><p>“Be right back.” Rio started off towards the stairs.</p><p>Agatha gave Wanda a chaste kiss of reassurance, her ex’s eyes lingering on the interaction. She then began to follow Rio out of the dining room, her mom calling a quick “Good luck.” as they left.</p><p>They made their way down the hall, family photos still hung up on the walls. She noticed as Rio stopped for a moment at the door to what used to be their room. Now, Agatha slept in it alone. It was open and Rio usually never came up here, her curiosity getting the better of her.</p><p>Agatha had repainted the walls, switching the sage green for a darker hunter  green. The duvet, once earth toned botanicals, was now black and white pinestripes. The area rug and end tables had been swapped out too. Now, taking it in through Rio’s eyes, the room looked…colder? More impersonal. Like whoever used to sleep in this room died, the new occupant simply using it as a place to exist rather than live.</p><p>Which wasn’t far off, if Agatha were to be honest with herself.</p><p>“It’s…different.” Rio stated, taking a couple of steps into the space.</p><p>“Needed a change of pace.” Agatha spoke, waiting in the doorway.</p><p>Her ex’s jaw tensed, fighting back a comment or perhaps an emotion. “I get it.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Rio’s hands fell to the dresser, picking up a picture frame that sat on top. It was the three of them on Nicky’s 7th birthday, the last one before everything broke down. When things were good. Agatha came up next to her ex wife, peering down at the photo. If she really looked, she could see herself just starting to show. The slightest swell of her stomach as Nicky smiled over her cake, Rio lifting her up to help blow out the candles as Agatha watched on fondly.</p><p>“That was a good day.” Agatha said, “I think that’s the year we got her the Build-A-Bear you can write on and then wash.”</p><p>“She fucking loved that thing.” Her ex spoke, face contorting like it hurt to recall such an item. “That poor bear had so many Spanish cuss words on it.”</p><p>“You’re the one who taught her ‘perra’.”</p><p>“It’s a female dog!”</p><p>Agatha took the frame from Rio and set it back down. “One of the few photos we got with the whole family.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio shoved her hands in her pockets, uncomfortable at the explicit mention of their second child.</p><p>The child they never truly talked about.</p><p>“We should go check on Nicky.” She offered, pushing down the anger at her ex wife’s refusal to acknowledge their youngest kid. The kid that Agatha spent nine months making, the kid that didn’t get to take a breath or cry or even blink.</p><p>Agatha could unleash the fury she felt in that moment, or she could focus on the child that needed her. She left the room, hearing the soft steps of Rio following. Agatha stopped at Nicky’s door, closed of course. She lifted her hand and gently knocked. “Sweetheart?”</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Rio knocked then, her voice cutting in. “Mija?”</p><p>At the sound of her mami’s voice, Nicky opened the door. She had her backpack slung over her shoulder, headphones on her neck, and her laptop in hand.</p><p>“I wanna stay at mami’s tonight.”</p><p>Agatha blinked a few times in confusion. “What?”</p><p>“I wanna stay with mami.” Nicky repeated. “She was gonna pick me up tomorrow anyway.”</p><p>“That’s not the arrangement, hon.” Agatha said, tone close to guilty.</p><p>“If only there wasn’t one!” Their daughter snapped. “If you hadn’t kicked mami out then you wouldn’t have to worry about this.”</p><p>“Hey.” Rio interjected. “I know you’re upset and you’re not wrong for how you feel. But your mom hasn’t done anything wrong and you’re being hurtful.”</p><p>No matter how bad things got, they were a united front when it came to Nicky. Their daughter was not a bargaining chip or a way to get the upper hand, she was their kid who they loved. She was a person.</p><p>“She’s inviting her fucking girlfriend to family dinners and expecting me to act like everything's fine.” Nicky ranted. “It’s not fine. <i>We’re not fine</i>!”</p><p>“Language.” Rio said in a way that mimicked Lilia. “We use swear words casually, not to insult people.”</p><p>“Teddy–” Agatha started.</p><p>“Don’t.” Nicky replied, voice like venom. “I’m old enough to decide where I want to be, and right now, it’s not here.”</p><p>A bullet would have been easier to take.</p><p>Rio sighed, “Nicky…”</p><p>“It’s fine.” Agatha rasped, her throat feeling tight. “She can go with you. It’s okay.”</p><p>Her ex cocked her head. “Really?”</p><p>Keeping her here wasn’t going to help, she needed to rebel and Agatha would rather her do it safely. She’d always be safe with Rio. And after Evanora, Agatha wanted her daughter to feel as though she had autonomy over herself, that her voice was heard.</p><p>Agatha looked at her daughter. “You need time to cool off, I get it. This will not be a regular thing, but one night won’t be the end of the world.”</p><p>Nicky nodded, a microscopic smile etching her features. “Thank you.”</p><p>“But you are apologizing to Wanda as you leave.” Agatha firmly stated. “And I’m sure your mami agrees with me.”</p><p>Their daughter looked at Rio, obviously expecting her not to agree. However, Rio knew better than to go against Agatha’s parenting. “I think that’s a great idea.”</p><p>Nicky’s jaw dropped. “What?”</p><p>“You want to sleep at my place tonight, then you’re apologizing.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes–</p><p>Again with fucking eyerolling, did she get that from Agatha?</p><p>Did Agatha really roll her eyes that often?</p><p>“Fine, I’ll apologize to el diabla.”</p><p>Agatha let out a small breath. “Maybe a good start would be not calling her the devil.”</p><p>“It’s how I feel. I thought my feelings were valid.” Nicky quipped, smirking at the work around.</p><p>“Okay.” Rio clapped her hands together. “Let’s hit the road, shall we?”</p><p>They all trudged downstairs, briefly stopping in the dining room so Nicky could apologize, which she did. Wanda was a good sport, accepting it with a light-hearted chuckle and offering to get the chain of the necklace repaired. Nicky didn’t seem enthusiastic about that prospect but didn’t lash out either.</p><p>Agatha walked them to the door, saying her goodbyes. She outstretched her arms in the faintest hope her daughter might actually take her up on a hug. “Happy birthday. I love you, hon.”</p><p>Her daughter just pulled her headphones on, ignoring her plea for contact and saying a single “Love you.” before stepping outside and down the pathway to the street where Rio had parked.</p><p>Again, she’d rather take a bullet.</p><p>She loathed when her daughter did that. Negate the ‘I’ part of ‘I love you’. It was on purpose. It was said out of obligation, not genuine emotion.</p><p>“Told you.” Agatha glared at her ex and let her arms drop.</p><p>“I can hug you, if that’ll make you feel better.”</p><p>No physical contact was the safest option. Less probability of a fuck-up occurring.</p><p>“It won’t.”</p><p>It would.</p><p>“Fair enough.” Rio fished her key out of her pocket, forearm flexing.</p><p>Yeah, Agatha noticed shit like that. The tattoos on full display, the lack of bra, the way her fucking muscles moved. She should feel guilty, but they didn’t divorce because either of them were unattractive. After all, Agatha had eyes.</p><p>“I’ll bring the WD-40 over tomorrow.” Rio said, halfway out the door.</p><p>“You’re still gonna do that?”</p><p>“Of course I am. I won’t sleep well knowing something’s wrong. Have a good night, Agatha.”</p><p>She closed the door, letting herself slump against it for a moment.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t remember the last time she slept well.</p><p>“I should probably head out too,” Wanda said, grabbing her bag. “Feels like you need a minute.”</p><p>Agatha crinkled her brows. “I need years.”</p><p>Wanda smiled, “She’s thirteen, she’ll get over it.”</p><p>“Maybe I rushed things–”</p><p>“Babe, you waited seven months before you even introduced us.” Wanda placed a delicate hand on her wrist, reassuring her. “She just needs time. God knows I was horrible at her age too.”</p><p>Nicky wasn’t horrible, she was confident and sure of who she was. Agatha wasn’t raised in a home where she could be loud, or speak her mind. Even if it did come out in less than ideal ways, she was proud Nicky was able to stand up for herself. But explaining all that was too much, so she settled on the safer response.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“I had thicker eyeliner, but the sentiment was the same. Mad at the world, angry at my mom.”</p><p>“You were emo?”</p><p>“Hot Topic got so much of my money.” She chuckled before leaning in and kissing her goodbye. “I’ll get the necklace fixed but I won’t pressure her to wear it.”</p><p>“You’re nice.” Agatha grinned. “I’m sorry for everything tonight.”</p><p>“Like I said, I get it.” Wanda kissed one more time before opening the door. “Dinner? Monday night?”</p><p>“Sounds good.”</p><p>“Night, babe. I love you.”</p><p>“Love you.” Agatha said as she closed the door behind her girlfriend.</p><p>See? Perfect on paper.</p><p>Yeah, Agatha wouldn’t be sleeping well tonight.</p><hr/><p>The drive home was silent, Rio periodically looking over to her daughter in the passenger's seat. Her headphones were blasting some angsty teen music, her head turned to look out the window.</p><p>When they got home, Nicky stalked off towards her bedroom. And Rio probably should’ve left it alone, but that ache that never left her chest began to pulse. She followed after her daughter, finding Nicky already slumped on the bed.</p><p>“Hey.” Rio tapped her ear to signal that Nicky needed to take off the headphones.</p><p>She did so, furrowing her brows in the same obtuse way Agatha always had. “What?”</p><p>“Could you be a little bit more chill?”</p><p>“I am chill.”</p><p>Rio nearly keeled over in astonishment. “You, daughter of mine, are anything but chill.”</p><p>“I thought I reacted appropriately given the circumstances…”</p><p>“You called Wanda a bimbo.”</p><p>“<i>Tehcnically,</i> I implied she was a bimbo. Not my fault if everyone at the table immediately agreed that she was the bimbo in question.”</p><p>“Stop saying that word.”</p><p>“I learned it from you!”</p><p>“Yeah, because I didn’t realize you were within earshot when I was ranting to your aunt Alice on the phone!”</p><p>“Again, not my fault.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath. “Listen, I know this sucks–”</p><p>“It sure fucking does.”</p><p>“<i>But</i>,” Rio kept speaking, “I need you to be nicer to your mom.”</p><p>“I’m plenty nice.”</p><p>“You could improve.”</p><p>“I went out to dinner with her and Wanda last night, I wore that fugly necklace today.” Nicky sat up. “What else does she want from me?”</p><p>Rio sat down next to her. “Maybe a hug…?”</p><p>Nicky averted her gaze. “Hugs are meant to show affection. I don’t feel particularly affectionate towards her.”</p><p>“Okay, but she did literally use her own body to create yours,” Rio raised her brows, sucking some air through her teeth. “So find it within yourself to cut her some slack.”</p><p>“I don’t know why you’re always defending her. She left you.”</p><p>Thank you to her child for reminding Rio of that.</p><p>“No, she didn’t. She asked me to leave and I did.” Rio brought her hand up to card through her daughter's hair.</p><p>“Why did you?”</p><p>“Oh, mi vida.” Rio ignored her own wound to nurse her daughter’s. “Sometimes things happen, and it’s hard to fix them.”</p><p>“You’d think losing Alex would’ve brought you guys closer.”</p><p>Fuck, if that name didn’t want to make her crumble on the spot.</p><p>“Doesn’t always work out that way.”</p><p>“I don’t like her. I’m never going to.” Nicky said, referring back to Wanda.</p><p>“You don’t have to, but you have to ease up on your mom. She loves you just as much as I do.”</p><p>“Fine.” Her daughter grumbled, “But I want a real family dinner, no outsiders or bimbos.”</p><p>“‘I’ll call your mom tomorrow and see what we can do. Fair?”</p><p>“Fair.”</p><p>“Good.” Rio got up, walking towards the door. “I love you, teddy.”</p><p>“I love you too, mami.”</p>

<p>Agatha was sprawled out in bed, hair splayed against the pillow, sweat beading in her hairline. Agatha’s back arched closer to her mouth. “<i>Rio! Fuck!</i>” She groaned, one hand clutching the headboard and steadily creeping closer to her third orgasm.</p><p>The room was quiet, soft light filtering through the blinds and projecting onto the bed. Gentle sun peeking through, an outside world that had long since been discarded by the pair. Clothes littered the floor, torn off without a thought and leaving them both naked.</p><p>Rio was <i>thriving</i>. Four of her fingers working inside her love, tongue pressed against her clit. She’d buried herself here if it were allowed. Agatha’s thighs shaking around her head, her fingers tangled in Rio’s hair, urging her on. The subtle creaking of the bedframe being the only sound other than Agatha’s curses.</p><p>“Missed this.” Rio husked in between licks, “Missed you so, <i>so fucking much</i>, mi vida.”</p><p>“Missed you too, been too long.” Agatha moaned, veins of her neck straining against the skin. “I’m close.”</p><p>A wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon.</p><p>
<b>It was November, 2009.</b>
</p><p>And for the record, it had only been seventy-two hours.</p><p>Rio had pulled a double at the hospital, disappearing nearly all weekend before coming back to her place and crashing. She fed herself, showered, and knocked the fuck out for several hours. She rented a shitty and rundown house with Alice, and had since they were interns. Jen moved in last year, followed by Agatha moving in about four months ago.</p><p>Her girlfriend had been home all weekend, hanging out with (or terrorizing) Jen or grading papers. She’d let Rio sleep in before waking her up by making her come on her tongue, Rio roused and immediately rolled them over.</p><p>Which is how they got here, fucking all afternoon and ignoring anything else. Over two years together and it was still the honeymoon stage. Well, kind of. Sure, they budgeted groceries and had both held each other’s hair back when they were sick and puking, but that’s love. It was a kind of love that Rio wanted forever.</p><p>“Baby, jesus fuck!” Agatha cried, slamming her legs shut as she came and involuntarily crushing Rio’s head like a grape.</p><p>There was no better feeling than those thighs threatening to decapitate her, Rio could fucking bet on it. She kept going until the aftershocks subsided, slowly pulling out her fingers, now glistening with remnants of her girlfriend’s orgasm. Rio popped them in her mouth, moaning at the taste.</p><p>“Mi amor, Jen and Alice are going to hear you.”</p><p>“Jen and Alice spent all of Saturday fucking like bunnies, be grateful you weren’t home to listen to any of it.”</p><p>Rio made the crawl up Agatha’s body, leaving lingering kisses on her bush, and stomach, and tits, and neck, and cheek, before arriving at her lips. The kiss was simple but filled with affection, a content hum leaving Agatha’s throat. Rio could feel the smile Agatha was biting back as Rio’s tongue licked into her mouth.</p><p>“I love you.” Rio whispered.</p><p>Agatha brought a hand to her cheek, brushing away the stray hairs in front of her face. “I love you too.”</p><p>She nuzzled her nose against her girlfriend’s for a beat before pulling back. “Close your eyes.”</p><p>Blue eyes did not close. “What?”</p><p>Rio got off the bed, still buck naked, and walked over to the dresser. “Close your eyes.”</p><p>“Baby, if this is about you not liking me watching while you put on the strap, I told you I don’t look and–”</p><p>She pulled open the top drawer, where they kept their strap, but also their socks. “It’s not. Just close your eyes, woman.”</p><p>Agatha huffed but did so, slinging her forearm over her face for good measure. “Fine.”</p><p>Rio made her way back over, the box secured in her grasp. “Hold out your hand.”</p><p>“I <i>also</i> told you that we need to buy better cuffs. That locking mechanism is child's play–”</p><p>“Hand.”</p><p>Agatha whipped out her left arm, hand gingerly dangling. “Better be good.”</p><p>“It is.” Rio opened the box, sliding the cool metal against skin. “Open.”</p><p>Her girlfriend moved her forearm, eyes fluttering open and focusing on the ring now adoring her left ring finger. She furrowed her brows in an obtuse manner, lips pouting. “What’s this?”</p><p>“A ring.” Rio grinned, admiring the way the stone sparkled in the light.</p><p>“Yes, I realize that. What is it doing on my finger?”</p><p>“Thought it would look good there.”</p><p>“Riiiiight…” Agatha sat up, inspecting the jewelry. “So is this a ring with diamonds or a diamond ring?”</p><p>“Well, it’s actually a green tourmaline. Way more ethical, and in my opinion, prettier than a blood diamond that somebody mined while being exploited for cheap labor.”</p><p>Dark green stone, emerald cut, thin gold band, <i>just</i> over a karat, and vintage. Rio saw it last month in a shop window on her way back to the hospital after grabbing some local and not terrible coffee (the only place on campus was a Dunkin’), and just knew she needed to get it on Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“The latter.”</p><p>“I don’t recall you proposing.”</p><p>“I thought I was doing that right now…?”</p><p>“You didn’t ask.”</p><p>“Agatha Evelyn Harkness,” Rio started, her girlfriend groaning at the use of her middle name which she hated. “Will you marry me?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, tilting her hand and making the stone refract the beams of sun. “I suppose, since it’s already on my hand and everything–”</p><p>Rio shot forward, tackling Agatha and pining her to the mattress. “You wanna be my wife so bad.”</p><p>“I do not!” She chuckled, barely putting up a fight.</p><p>“You do! You wanna be Mrs. Agatha Harkness-Vidal so bad, it makes you look stupid!”</p><p>Her fiancee blushed, fighting to speak through her belly laughs. “I’m not hyphenating, I’m gonna be Mrs. Vidal.”</p><p>Rio’s heart ticked up in speed, a genuine curl of her lips forming. “Mrs.Vidal?”</p><p>“It’s not like I’m in love with Harkness.” She snorted. “Besides, I like the thought of our kids being Vidals. It’s a good family name. <i>The Vidals</i>.”</p><p>“Dr. and Mrs. Vidal.” Rio said, getting a feel for their future. “I like it, sounds right.”</p><p>“Mmmh.” Agatha craned her head up, connecting their lips in a sweet kiss. “Now…celebratory engagement sex?”</p><p>“Fuck yes.” Rio jumped up, retrieving the strap for real this time. Her girlfriend propped up on her elbows and staring. “Okay, but…can you actually not watch?”</p><p>She flopped back down. “Oh my god!”</p><p>“What?! I feel awkward!”</p><p>“You’re ridiculous…”</p><p>“Mmmhh.” Rio fastened the harness, weaving the strap through the o-ring. “And you <i>love</i> me!” She then jumped onto the bed, settling herself on top of her fiancee.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks pulled tighter, her smile big and face rosy. “Sure.”</p><p>“Admit it.”</p><p>“I am fond of you.”</p><p>Rio lightly jabbed her side, right where she knew she was ticklish. “Admit it.”</p><p>“Rio!” She jerked, clumsily swatting Rio’s hand away through her giggles. “Ri- stop! Rio!”</p><p>“Admit it!”</p><p>“I love you!” She chuckled, finally relaxing once Rio pulled her hand away. “I love you.”</p><p>“Knew it.” Rio leaned in, her lips brushing Agatha’s. “I love you too. So much.”</p><p>“So much.”</p><p>A week later, Rio was parking her 1999 Subaru Forester in front of Agatha’s mom’s house. It was thanksgiving, the first they’d spend together since usually Rio was at the hospital. However, being newly engaged meant needing to actually <i>meet</i> her fiancee’s mom. Rio had never done so, despite Lilia and Agatha calling one another every week and spending a bare minimum of an hour on the phone every single time.</p><p>Rio didn’t particularly get along with her own parents, and didn't talk to them much. They were religious and conservative and proud of her for her education and career but not her ‘lifestyle choice’. They were part of that damned 44% of latinos that voted for Bush, so…enough said.</p><p>But it didn’t matter, because Rio was good with parents. Charming even. And any woman who produced someone as perfect as Agatha couldn’t be bad. As they walked up the frosted walkway to the door, Agatha stopped at the front door and hesitated. Her winter jacket swallowed her as she turned to face Rio.</p><p>“Listen, there’s a few things you need to know before we go in.”</p><p>Rio gave a nervous smile. “Like what?”</p><p>“My mom is loud, and completely lacking in boundaries, and <i>will</i> try to force feed you cannoli."</p><p>“How terrible…?”</p><p>“She’s also not…technically my mom.” Agatha raised her hands in defence at Rio opening her mouth to question. “Like, in every way she is. Just genetically, she didn’t birth me…”</p><p>Rio had assumed, like most people do, that Agatha was blood related to Lilia. She felt kind of douchey to have assumed that now, but her fiancee also never brought it up in the over two years they had been together.</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me you were adopted?” Rio tilted her head, genuinely just trying to understand.</p><p>Agatha let out a long breath. “Because I wasn’t.”</p><p>“I’m <i>so</i> lost.” She scratched her head through the knit beanie Agatha had made for her, a burnt orange color.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha let her shoulders drop, the tension leaving her body. “I grew up in foster care from when I was fourteen til’ I aged out. I don’t like talking about it because obviously it conjures <i>supper happy</i> memories and feelings...” She grimaced, “I bounced around about six different homes until I was placed with Lilia, which thank god, because she was the only one who was patient enough with me. She never formally adopted me, she offered, but by that time I was already about to turn eighteen and just didn’t want her to go through all the effort.”</p><p>Rio blinked a couple of times. “You grew up in foster care?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me sooner?”</p><p>“I don’t know…Lilia’s my mom and it’s good enough for me.” Her posture shrunk. “Didn’t want to answer questions as to <i>why</i> I was in the system to begin with.”</p><p>“You don’t have to explain anything to me.” She smiled, taking the hand that had the sparkly green stone. “Honestly, I’m just glad she’s not a republican.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “I think she’s still got her Obama ‘08 button somewhere.”</p><p>“<i>And cannoli</i>? Fuck, I lucked out in the in-law department.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, placing a chaste kiss against her lips. “I think I’m the lucky one.”</p><p>“Querida–”</p><p>The front door swung open, an older woman in flowy, patterned clothing appearing. Her hair was gray and curly and sitting atop her head in a rushed bun. “I waited as long as I could but you guys were taking too long and I got antsy.”</p><p>Agatha pulled away. “And to think I just called you patient.”</p><p>Lilia opened her arms. “You never visit, c’mere!”</p><p>Her fiancee huffed but threw her arms around her mom, letting the older woman engulf her. Her eyes then zeroed in on Rio, a grin spreading across her face. She let Agatha go, almost pushing her out of the way.</p><p>“The doctor!” Lilia then grabbed Rio, pulling her into a hug before she could react. “I’ve heard a lot about you.”</p><p>Rio brought her arms up, hugging back and looking at Agatha. “A lot, huh?”</p><p>Seven months later, they got married. They signed the paperwork and filed the marriage license in Massachusetts, one of the few states at the time where they could get legally wed. But, because they were young and in love, they also had one of those kitschy chapel weddings in Vegas. Agatha wore a $20 slip dress, short and off-white. Rio thrifted a suit, not bad for a men’s petite, honestly. Jen and Alice accompanied them, the trip costing most of their savings but very worth it for the memory alone. After leaving the chapel, tipsy and giggly, they passed a tattoo parlor. It was a little seedy, but they did $10 flash pieces. Leading Agatha to getting a cursive <i>R</i> on the side of her ribcage, Rio getting a cursive <i>A</i> in the same spot. It was a fucking miracle neither of them got a staph infection from it.</p><p>Around 2AM, the four of them were aimlessly wandering around their resort casino, when Agatha stopped at the craps table. Jen and Alice were playing slots as Rio supported her wife in her frivolous endeavor to spend money that they didn’t have. She leaned over the table, dress riding up and a cheap veil still stuck to her head.</p><p>“Blow.” Agatha held up the dice.</p><p>“Baby…”</p><p>“It’s good luck!”</p><p>“This is not luck, it’s chance.”</p><p>“We met by chance, we met again by luck.” Agatha pouted, still holding up the dice. “Blow me, baby.”</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue against her cheek. “Sounds familiar.”</p><p>“You’re not gonna blow your wife?” She cocked her head. “It’s for a good cause.”</p><p>Rio smirked, quickly blowing on the sticky looking dice. “Happy?”</p><p>“Ecstatic.” Agatha turned, underhand throwing the dice along the felt of the table.</p><p>“Seven.” The casino guy called, clearing the table. “Congrats.”</p><p>Agatha, still not sober, blinked as he handed her a chip. Rio peered over her shoulder to see how much she had won.</p><p>“$5,000?!” Rio nearly screamed.</p><p>Agatha scrunched her nose, pursing her lips in victory. “Not bad for a $300 buy-in, huh?”</p><p>“My apologies to lady luck.”</p><p>Agatha slung her arms over Rio’s shoulders, drunkenly leaning into her. “Wanna take lady luck back to the room, handsome?”</p><p>“Fuck yes.”</p><p>The casino payout, mixed with a loan from Lilia, paid for the down payment of their home the following year. The housing market still recuperating after the 2008 recession also helped <i>temedously.</i></p><p>Wishbones being broken doesn’t guarantee luck and fortune to whoever got the bigger part. Throwing salt over one’s shoulder does not protect them or dissipate some non-existent bad karma. Black cats don’t signify death approaching.</p><p>Rio knew this, and yet, she felt like the luckiest woman alive.</p><hr/><p>“Mami!” Nicky called down the hall, her voice clipped.</p><p>Rio hastily put on her scrub top, walking down the hall to her daughter’s room. “What?”</p><p>“Have you seen my green button up?”</p><p>“The kinda olive toned one?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows. “No, but that's probably because it’s your mom’s and you keep stealing it from her.”</p><p>Agatha had that button up since before they started dating, Rio could quite literally count the times she shucked that shirt off to, well–</p><p>Not the time to think about that.</p><p>It was mid October, the usual morning panic occurred as Rio got herself ready for work and Nicky ready for school. She leaned against the doorframe. “You need it that bad?”</p><p>“Yes!” Nicky threw up her arms, currently dressed in jeans and a tank top. “I had a vision for this outfit.”</p><p>“A vision…sounds pretty serious.”</p><p>“I think it’s at mom’s place.”</p><p>“Sorry, teddy.”</p><p>“Can we stop there on the way to school?”</p><p>“Mi vida–”</p><p>“Please.” Nicky asked, using those huge amber eyes to her advantage.</p><p>“You literally have a whole closet of flannels, maybe too many. And I say that as a lesbian.”</p><p>“C’mon, if we leave now, we can stop with plenty of time.”</p><p>Rio sighed, “Fine. Text your mom, I'll throw something in the toaster for us to eat on the go.”</p><p>“It’s fine.” She dismissed, pulling out her phone.</p><p>“Hey, breakfast is important for a reason, and it is my legal obligation to feed you.”</p><p>After scarfing down frozen waffles, Rio diligently drove her daughter to the townhouse. She parked her 2025 Subaru Forrester on the street and watched as Nicky ran up the steps, using her key to get inside. Five minutes later, and no Nicky. Rio turned off her car, making her way up to the front door and letting herself in.</p><p>As Rio entered, she could feel the rage of her daughter before locating her. The kitchen and living room were empty, so she jogged upstairs, the sounds of voices becoming clearer.</p><p>“Seriously?!” Nicky shouted.</p><p>“Baby, I know you’re upset.” Agatha tried to soothe.</p><p>Rio scrunched her face, her gut swirling to signify danger. She walked to the open door of Agatha’s room, popping her head in.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Rio could’ve gone her whole life without this image seared into her head. She’d need to bleach her eyes later, this was too cruel of an image.</p><p>Agatha speaking to Nicky as Wanda laid in bed, fucking mortified. She should note that they were both fully clothed, but it still made her nauseous. Agatha hadn’t even switched out the mattress before sleeping with another woman in a room they once used to share.</p><p>“I texted you and you couldn’t have moved your bimbo!” Nicky groaned, tears welling.</p><p>“Nicky, I didn’t see it.” Agatha, dressed in a robe and hair wild, spoke. Rio remembers when she’d get to wake up to that sight, of Agatha sleepy with her bedhead. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>To be fair, it was Rio’s week and this was sprung on her ex wife with little notice.</p><p>“Can I just-” Nicky's voice broke. “Can I just have the shirt so I can go?”</p><p>Agatha’s own blue glazed over with tears, a somber smile appearing. “Yeah, yeah of course.” And opened the door to the walk-in closet, now half empty where RIo’s clothes used to hang.</p><p>Rio sucked in a harsh breath, accidentally making eye contact with her wife’s girlfriend. “Wanda.”</p><p>The red head winced, her hand covering her face. “Rio.”</p><p>Agatha flung the hanger back into the closet, handing the shirt to Nicky. “Hon–”</p><p>Nicky snatched the shirt and bolted out of the room, stomping down the stairs.</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio. “Really?”</p><p>“I told her to text you! How was I supposed to know Wanda would be here?”</p><p>“A call would’ve been nice.”</p><p>Rio wanted to scream that she shouldn’t have to call her own fucking wife, but that wasn’t reality. She bit back the bile in her throat. “Dually noted.”</p><p>Agatha’s face was stone. “Thanks.”</p><p>“Have a good day molding young minds.” Rio said, turning to leave.</p><p>“Have a good day saving babies.” Agatha murmured.</p><p>And Rio was aware of the connotations, the verbal jab. She didn’t take the bait though, going back downstairs and out to her car. She got in, her daughter trying very hard not to cry.</p><p>“Nicky…” She spoke, “Whatever you’re feeling is okay.”</p><p>“I hate her.” Her daughter said, tears spilling down her face. “I <i>hate</i> her.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes closed, willing the tears to stop. Thank god she hadn’t said that to her ex wife’s face, it would pulverize Agatha to hear it.</p><p>“No, you don’t.”</p><p>“I do!”</p><p>“No.” Rio said softly. “You don’t. She didn’t do anything to hurt you.”</p><p>“She–”</p><p>“I know. But it wasn’t on purpose, mija.</p><p>“It feels like she doesn't care.”</p><p>“She does. She cares <i>so</i> much.”</p><p>“Could’ve fooled me.” Nicky openly sobbed, using the back of her hand to wipe the snot. “I thought they were done. Hadn’t seen that <i>puta</i> in a month.”</p><p>Yeah, Rio was aware that Agatha had pulled back on integrating Wanda into family activities. They did that family dinner, just the three of them, last month. It was surprisingly tame, no yelling or fighting. But Rio was also aware that Agatha hadn’t ended things with Wanda, much to her own despair.</p><p>“Her dating doesn’t mean she doesn’t care about or love you. She’s a person outside of being your mom, teddy.”</p><p>“I know, I just-” Nicky cried, “I just thought that if she was single then…”</p><p>Then they’d get back together.</p><p>Her daughter just wanted her parents together.</p><p>Not a crazy thing to ask, or to want.</p><p>Hell, Rio would rip her own heart out of her chest and physically give it to her ex if it would mean they could go back to how they used to be.</p><p>“Oh, baby.” Rio cooed, pulling her daughter over the center console and hugging her. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Nicky’s frame shook in her arms, her mascara almost definitely staining Rio’s scrub top. They sat there for a few minutes until Nicky pulled back, wiping her eyes and pulling on Agatha’s shirt. She sniffled, shaking her head. “Can’t fucking belive her.”</p><p>“Mija, I'm just as guilty. You’re not being fair to her.”</p><p>“But you haven’t moved on! You’re not trying to replace your marriage with a woman almost a decade younger!”</p><p>Agatha was forty-two and Wanda was thirty-five so by no means was it midlife crisis territory, but Wanda being younger didn’t necessarily help Rio’s growing resentment.</p><p>“What happened between us had nothing to do with you.”</p><p>“Can we get coffee?” Nicky asked out of the blue, changing the topic of conversation.</p><p>Jesus, if only she recognized just how much her and Agatha were alike.</p><p>Rio turned the key in the ignition, starting the car. “Yeah, I think we’ve earned it this morning.”</p><p>Once her teenage daughter was irresponsibly caffeinated and dropped off at school, Rio got to the hospital. She made her rounds, but her smile grew when she got to her favorite patient.</p><p>William Kaplan, six years old, preferred to go by Billy. He had been coming to her almost since he was born, around the time she’d lost a kid of her own. He had leukemia and had endured more surgeries than anyone should in their life, let alone someone so young.</p><p>So, naturally, Rio felt a type of kinship with him.</p><p>She walked in, chart in hand. “Billy!”</p><p>“Rio!” He chirped, dinosaur stuffy in his clutches. Rio had given it to him over a year ago and he still held onto it as a symbol of pride. A reward for being brave.</p><p>“How are we feeling today, dude?” She asked, giving a nod to his parents. “I’m not saying I don’t like you guys, but I would <i>love</i> to stop seeing you here.”</p><p>“Feeling is mutual.” Rebecca said, face gray and tired.</p><p>“I feel okay.” Billy informed, his small body propped up on the bed. The chemo and cancer had stunted his growth, causing him to look much younger than he actually was. “Tommy’s ear is falling off.”</p><p>Tommy, the dinosaur, did have a loose ear.</p><p>“I keep meaning to sew it but–” Rebecca started.</p><p>“Oh, it's fine.” Rio said, gently taking the dinosaur and inspecting it. “I think he just needs a small surgery.”</p><p>“Like me!” Billy smiled.</p><p>Rio grinned. “<i>Exactly</i> like you.”</p><p>The rest of the day was fine, she got Billy’s surgery on the books and scarfed down what she could in between running around. Being a surgeon didn’t exactly mean getting to clock in and out at an exact time, so around 3PM, she called her ex. Agatha usually picked up Nicky or their daughter took the bus, however she didn’t anticipate being late today.</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha answered.</p><p>“Can you pick up Nicky? I’m not getting out of here anytime soon.”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Why do you sound surprised? She is my child.”</p><p>“Yeah, I know that, I guess I just figured you’d still be pissed.”</p><p>“I am, but not at her.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio worked her jaw. “I’m sorry for this morning, I thought you knew.”</p><p>Silence from the other end for a minute, then a sigh. “I’m sorry too. I didn’t want you or her seeing that.”</p><p>She bit her lip for a moment, never knowing when to leave well enough alone. “Yeah, me too.”</p><p>“It wasn’t on purpose!”</p><p>“I know. I just–”</p><p>Love you and wish you loved me back.</p><p>Want our family back.</p><p>Want you back.</p><p>Hate seeing our daughter cry.</p><p>“I’ve just had a long day.”</p><p>“I’ll pick up Nicky and bring her back to yours.” The line went dead immediately after, no room for argument.</p><p>Rio’s hand dropped from her ear, her phone going black.</p><p>“Fuck.” She muttered.</p><hr/><p>Nicky didn’t speak to Agatha as they drove home, her daughter decidedly keeping her mouth in a straight line. If she could go back in time to this morning, she would've happily kicked her girlfriend out before her daughter and ex arrived.</p><p>She’d beaten herself up for the past month, wondering if she should cut her losses and break up with Wanda. Sure, Wanda was attractive and smart, but she wasn’t worth the emotional toll it was taking on Nicky. But Wanda was also easy. Easy to be around, easy to spend time with, non offensive. And if she could just check out of the reality of her life for a tiny bit, should she have that right?</p><p>Wanda didn’t know about Agatha’s mother, or her upbringing. She wasn’t there when Agatha woke up in a hospital room, recovering from being sliced open and her baby missing. She didn’t witness Agatha rotting away in bed for weeks after, physically too frail to walk farther than the bathroom.</p><p>Wanda was just <i>simple</i>.</p><p>They got to Rio’s loft, Agatha holding the door open for a very grumpy thirteen year old. When Nicky started for her bedroom without saying anything, Agatha stopped her.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Agatha said, dropping her keys on the kitchen island. “Teddy, I’m really, <i>really</i> sorry.”</p><p>Her daughter, backpack still slung on her shoulder, olive green shirt still on her body, looked at her. “I never understood why mami always took your side. I thought maybe she was just a doormat. But then I really thought about it, why she would defend you no matter what.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say a word, she wanted to know what her daughter was thinking.</p><p>“And then I realized, all those times I left the house and came back to you in a better mood. When I’d spend the day with friends and get back to your place and see you changing the sheets.” Nicky’s eyes went glassy. “And it was <i>always</i> after a break up….”</p><p>“Nicky.”</p><p>“You guys were hooking up, right? You didn’t want me to know but I do and now you’re keeping mami on hold again.”</p><p>Way more than a kid should ever know about their parents.</p><p>And Agatha wasn’t keeping Rio on hold.</p><p>“Your mami is free to see whoever she wants.”</p><p>“And you know she won’t!” She dropped her backpack. “I’m not stupid, I watch you guys just as closely as you watch each other. She loves you and you let her. You date Wanda before mami can even <i>think</i> about someone else. You lost Alex and you fucking threw mami out!”</p><p>Agatha knew being a teenage girl, the anguish and the rage. But shit, if her own daughter wasn’t demolishing her bit by bit right now. She understood she couldn’t just smother Nicky with love, a pine tree doesn’t grow in a shotglass or whatever the fuck. But the need to reach out and make everything better was going haywire in her brain, to stop her baby’s pain.</p><p>“I understand that I’ve not been perfect, I get it. But, I’m not trying to cause you or mami pain.”</p><p>Nicky scoffed, cocking her head. “You don’t have to, you’re just naturally talented at it.” She picked up her backpack, running upstairs and shutting her bedroom door.</p><p>Agatha dropped her head into her hands, setting her elbows on the kitchen island. The tears stung as they escaped, stifling any sound so her daughter wouldn’t hear. She didn’t need Nicky feeling guilty, she just wanted her daughter to not hate her. She must’ve been standing there for twenty, thirty minutes.</p><p>The door gently shut and she whipped her head over at the noise, her ex standing there with a pizza. Rio set down the pizza, face etched with concern.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>And Agatha didn’t have the words, so she just reached out, grabbing her ex and burrowing her head into her shoulder and sobbing. “She hates me.”</p><p>“Second Vidal to cry on me today…” Rio’s arms reacted on instinct, embracing her. “She doesn’t. She’s thirteen.”</p><p>“I hated my mother at thirteen.”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio pulled back fractionally, grabbing Agatha’s face and gently cradling it. “You’re <i>nothing</i> like your mother.”</p><p>“I’m fucking everything up.” Agatha sniffled, “I-I’m a terrible mom.”</p><p>Because that’s what it felt like, her relationship with her daughter collapsing because she couldn't just move on and get past Alex. Because Agatha let it consume her, let it eat her alive.</p><p>Her ex wife’s face scrunched, a cute frown forming. “You’re a great mom.”</p><p>“Great moms don’t have screaming matches with their kids.”</p><p>“I doubt it was a screaming match. You’re always louder, cariño.”</p><p>Against her better judgement, Agatha released a small chuckle. “I should go.”</p><p>“Why? It’s Friday, there’s pizza. I have booze.”</p><p>“Tempting.” Agatha grabbed her keys. “But I think I need to wallow alone. Nicky doesn’t want me here.”</p><p>Rio’s face fell. “Okay.”</p><p>“Hug her for me?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Agatha opened the door, leaving her daughter to her solitude. “She knows about us fucking periodically, by the way.”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>“Yeah, so…have fun with that.”</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>“Do you want me to go up there with you? See what happens?” She quirked a brow. “Really?”</p><p>Rio exhaled a breath. “I see your point, and while I don’t like it, I do respect it.”</p><p>“See you Sunday.”</p><p>As Agatha closed the door she heard “See you Sunday.”</p><p>As she got in her car Agatha slumped in the seat, her phone pinging at the same time. She lifted her hips, blindly fishing it out of her pocket and reading the text.</p><p><b>Wanda, 5:22:</b> Drinks? My place? We can drown in a bubble bath together.</p><p>She rolled her eyes, which wasn’t fair considering her girlfriend wasn’t privy to what she’d just endured from her daughter. If Agatha couldn’t spend the night with her daughter, she’d just rather spend it alone.</p><p><b>Agatha, 5:24:</b> Swamped with grading. Raincheck?</p><p><b>Wanda, 5:25:</b> Sure, I love you.</p><p>Agatha locked her phone, running a stressed hand through her hair. Ignoring her girlfriend because she couldn’t get her brain off Nicky. Maybe ending things would be for the best.</p><p>Maybe being alone would be better.</p><p>Then her mind flashed to hugging her ex wife, how safe it felt. How it remedied everything all at once. How she could’ve stayed there for longer, as long as Rio would’ve allowed.</p><p>No, she was not supposed to think that.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>She could fix it, this problem could be solved.</p><p>She opened her phone again, thumbs flying across the screen.</p><p><b>Agatha, 5:29:</b> On second thought, I can be there in an hour…</p>

<p>“That’s the last of it.” Jen groaned, haphazardly dropping the box and kicking the front door closed.</p><p>Agatha rushed over, inspecting the wood of the door. “We <i>just</i> got the place, could you not?”</p><p>Jen cocked her head. “We’re helping you move all your shit in for free. So no.”</p><p>“You get the place checked for mold? It’s ancient.” Alice gawked, peering around the corner into the living room.</p><p>“Of course.” Rio said, digging through a box, “Not exposing my wife and future children to that.”</p><p>“Good.” Jen replied, running a hand over the century old banister of the staircase. “Because once that shit’s in your lungs…”</p><p>“Oh, I know.” Rio huffed, “Last thing I need is neurological issues twenty years down the line–”</p><p>“Oh my god.” Agatha snapped, pushing past the lot of them towards the kitchen. “Fuck, I will <i>not</i> miss living with three doctors. Fucking nerds.”</p><p>
<b>January, 2011.</b>
</p><p>And they had just spent the day trekking through snow and sleet to get everything moved into their new home. The one they <i>owned</i>. Agatha was pretty sure that was a first for a Harkness woman. Evanora just bounced from apartment to apartment until they evicted her ass, and subsequently, Agatha’s too.</p><p>They had gotten it at a bargain, the townhome being a little rough around the edges. Meaning, it was old and in desperate need of several thousand updates and repairs. But, Agatha’s hot and sexy wife swore she could do most everything herself with the exception of the ensuite bathroom off the master bedroom.</p><p>Agatha didn’t know much about the bathroom but did nearly keel over at the puny size of the closet in that same bedroom. Do people just not shop? Do they not need a different pair of jeans for each individual outfit? For the love of god, who owns less than ten pairs of shoes? Rio might call her a clothing hoarder, Agatha liked to think of herself as a curator. The fact that most of her life had been contained to a garbage bag or less for most of her adolescence might have something to do with it, but she digresses.</p><p>Rio promised to build her a walk-in, additionally, she also promised to line their living room with bookshelves for Agatha’s ever growing collection of literature. She <i>was</i> an English teacher after all, Rio knew what she was getting herself into.</p><p>They had a very precise budget to stick to, sure Rio was an attending now, and Agatha had taken on teaching an AP lit course to make more income, but money was still tight. Hence why they bribed their friends with the promise of beer and pizza if they helped them move. Jen and Alice didn’t keep the old house once Rio and Agatha announced they had found a place, instead they opted to get a swanky apartment near the hospital.</p><p>Alice was in pediatrics with Rio, Jen had one more year as a resident since she was in obstetrics and gynecology and had one more year of residency to complete. Probably the reason why they weren’t engaged yet, Jen wanted to be an attending before planning a wedding.</p><p>“Fine,” Jen smirked, “But the next time you have a UTI–”</p><p>“That was <i>one</i> time!” Agatha defended, opening the fridge and grabbing four beers. “And you can thank my lovely wife for that.”</p><p>Rio had kept her tied to the bed too long, consensually of course, but they probably should’ve taken a break for Agatha to pee.</p><p>Her wife grinned. “That was a good anniversary…”</p><p>“Gross.” Alice scrunched her face, taking a beer for her and Jen from Agatha’s hands.</p><p>The next couple of months proceeded with Agatha and Rio spending nearly every night and weekend working on the house. And she had to admit, there was something sick about her wife drilling and hammering shit in a beater tank. Agatha would diligently stand there, holding whatever for Rio, all the while drooling over how Rio’s arms fucking flexed. She pulled <i>so well</i>, those tattoos glistening with sweat as Rio ripped out drywall or lugged heavy shit around.</p><p>Needless to say, they got distracted.</p><p><i>A lot</i>.</p><p>She was pretty sure they had christened their new home fairly quickly, no room went unscathed. One memory in particular, of them installing the new counter tops before Rio bent her over said countertops, would always stay implanted in her brain. It’s not her fault their sex life was fucking addictive, it just <i>was</i>.</p><p>Agatha always felt her most powerful during sex. She felt strong and desired and she didn’t feel shame in that. Her wife felt the same way, apparently, dutifully falling to her knees when Agatha dropped her voice even slightly. Rio fucked Agatha like it was a privilege, which sometimes, she decided it was. She would make Rio beg and plead to just go down on her.</p><p>See? Powerful.</p><p>It was early spring when her wife texted, asking if Agatha could drop off some dinner since Rio would most likely be stuck at the hospital all night. Agatha agreed, getting off the couch and saving the spot in her book. She threw on her wifes Red Soxs hoodie and some leggings before heading out, she had been to the hospital a multiple times, but it was a still fucking maze.</p><p>She eventually stumbled upon the pediatric wing, lunchbox in hand. Agatha found the nurses station, making sure to drop them off some homemade cookies because while she wasn’t a great cook, she could bake pretty damn well. And the cookies ensured they were all nice to her wife, and everyone should be nice to Rio lest they be beaten very violently with a rock by Agatha. Once she chatted with them for far longer than she had actually wanted to, she went on the hunt for her wife. She knew Rio wasn’t in surgery because as a doctor’s wife, she had learned the routine. Nothing on the board indicated that she had anything scheduled, also, Rio’s lucky scrub cap was still on their dresser. It was one that Agatha had gifted her their first Christmas together, black and white with Snoopy patterned all over it and yellow Woodstocks.</p><p>She stopped briefly at the observation window where all the newborns laid in their small plastic bassinets. All soft, and squishy, and safe. She pouted her bottom lip, her brows furrowing as if the mere sight of a baby was going to make her burst into tears.</p><p>No.</p><p>Her and Rio had agreed to wait a few more years before starting their family, not ideal because Agatha was almost thirty and wanted her kids to be kind of closer together in age, but it was what they landed on. Rio had made it clear early on that she wanted kids, just had no interest in carrying. Which was fine by Agatha because despite her own upbringing, she actually liked the idea of being pregnant. Maybe something inside her wanted to give her kid the childhood she never had, which scared the fuck out of her. Because what if that was the same thought her mother had when she was pregnant with Agatha? Shouldn’t it have been? To bring a child into the world wanting to love them?</p><p>One of the babies cooed, a bundle of mush that would grow up to be an actual human. Agatha gently shook her head, she had to find her wife before she went crazy. She kept moving, the sterile smell of antiseptic burning her nostrils. She kept wandering until she hit the NICU, spotting her wife through the window.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Rio was holding a baby, a premie at that, slowly swaying in a rocking chair and nonsensically whispering. The hand with her simple gold wedding band cradled the tiny body, a soft smile on her face, her hair frenzied and scrubs wrinkled.</p><p>
<i>Is it wrong that the sight turned Agatha on?</i>
</p><p>Maybe it was a biological impulse but all she could think was how her wife needed to get her pregnant, as soon as humanly possible preferably. Agatha raised her hand, gently tapping her knuckles on the glass, watching as Rio’s eyes trailed up and met her own. Her wife’s smile grew, her gaze somehow softening even further.</p><p><i>I need to have her baby.</i> Agatha’s obviously hormonal brain helpfully supplied. <i>Biblically.</i></p><p>Once the baby was back in their crib, safe and sound, Rio met her in the hall. Her wife sprung forward, resting her hands on her waist as she kissed Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>“Thank you for dinner.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head towards the window. “Patient of yours?”</p><p>“Yeah. Her mom is a single parent, works late. She’s getting stronger medically, but I try to make sure she gets some physical touch. Babies don’t thrive without it.”</p><p>Yeah, neither did Agatha.</p><p>“Is that why you’ve been staying late so much recently?”</p><p>Rio flushed, slightly embarrassed. “I always earned high grades in bedside manner.”</p><p>Agatha handed her the lunchbox. “You have a minute?”</p><p>“Yeah? You wanna have dinner together?”</p><p>She smirked. “In a way.”</p><p>Eight minutes later Agatha had her wife pinned against the door of an on-call room, greedily groping at her body through her scrubs.</p><p>Rio’s hand fisted in her hair, biting her lip not to moan. “Where’d this come from?”</p><p>“You with a baby, mostly.” Agatha husked, one hand traveling underneath the waistband of Rio’s pants, the other wedging itself in her wife's sports bra. “So fucking hot.”</p><p>“I wor- work with babies a lot, cariño.” Her wife rasped as Agatha mouthed along her neck, as fingers lightly pinched her nipple. “Christ–”</p><p>“Yeah, but <i>seeing</i> it?” Agatha had to hold back her moan, her fingers brushing over trimmed hair. “God, I need to fuck you.”</p><p>Rio raised her arm, glancing at her watch. “I have ten minutes to eat before they’ll get suspicious.”</p><p>“I only need five.”</p><p>Two orgasms and six minutes later, her wife lounged on the twin bed, languidly eating the pb&amp;j sandwich Agatha had made her. There was also a bag of chips, some celery and baby carrots, a sugar free redbull, and a homemade cookie.</p><p>Agatha happily laid next to her wife, ignoring her own arousal for the time being and letting Rio scarf down enough to keep her going.</p><p>“So, are you actually going to tell me what that was about?” Rio asked, sucking some peanut butter off her thumb.</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Guess seeing you like that did something to me…”</p><p>“Seeing me like what?”</p><p>“I don’t know…maternal?”</p><p>“Agatha–”</p><p>It wasn’t the right time, they should wait. Agatha already knew what Rio would say, and she’d rather not hear it. So, she shifted gears.</p><p>She quickly leaned over, giving Rio a chaste kiss before sitting up. “I should go, it’s 9PM and I have school tomorrow.”</p><p>Her wife sat up too. “Okay.”</p><p>She stood, kissing her once more. “Try to be home at a reasonable hour?”</p><p>“No promises.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Enjoy the food and the post-sex glow.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Yeah, you should visit me at work more often.”</p><p>“Mmhhh.” Agatha hummed, quirking a brow. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go home and masturbate furiously in our marital bed before passing out.”</p><p>Rio’s face twisted forlornly. “Mi amor!”</p><p>Agatha opened the door, throwing a wink as she left. “Have a good night saving babies.”</p><p>She kept her word, enjoying three self induced orgasms before falling asleep, idly noting her wife crawling into bed around two o’clock in the morning. Agatha could smell the cedar of Rio’s perfume and that familiar antiseptic. A warm hand grazed her hip, fingers playing with the waistband of her underwear. Agatha was a big advocate for the big shirt and no pants combo when she went to bed, her wife knew and absolutely loved this.</p><p>“Mornin’.” Agatha grumbled, only half awake. She turned over, peeking her eyes open enough to see Rio grinning.</p><p>“Morning.” Her wife said, hand now fully sheathed in Agatha’s panties.</p><p>“How are you horny at this hour?” She gasped as Rio trailed her fingers through her already wet cunt.</p><p>“Thought I’d return the favor.” Rio reasoned, lurching forward to kiss her. “And we need to talk.”</p><p>“Right now?” Agatha asked, raising her own hand to tangle in Rio’s t-shirt. “C-can it wait?”</p><p>“You’re more honest when you’re about to come.”</p><p>“Fuck off.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers steadily worked her up. “What got into you tonight?”</p><p>“I-uh,” Agatha swallowed. “You looked good.”</p><p>“I always look good to you, there’s more.”</p><p>Curse this woman for always seeing through her, and fuck her for knowing an orgasm was like a truth serum on Agatha.</p><p>She arched her back and hiked her leg over Rio’s hip once she felt two fingers find her entrance. “You…with a baby, it- it did something for me.”</p><p>“How so?”</p><p>Agatha let out a soft moan as Rio started thrusting. “Thought about you with our own…”</p><p>“Our own?”</p><p>“Baby. Our own baby.”</p><p>Rio’s thumb came to her clit, massaging it. “Our kid, huh? Your eyes and attitude in a tiny body?”</p><p>“Y-your eyes.” She corrected, her stomach swirling. “And your tooth gap, your crooked smile–”</p><p>“You wanna have my babies, mi alma?”</p><p>Fucking obviously.</p><p>“The- the attitude though should be mine. You’re too nice.”</p><p>“Oh that kid would rule the world.”</p><p>“Yeah.” She breathed out, so fucking close.</p><p>And of course that was the exact moment Rio stopped, ignoring Agatha’s whine in protest. “Should we get started on that?”</p><p>Agatha’s brain worked to play catch-up. “We said we’d wait.”</p><p>“Doesn’t seem like you want to.”</p><p>“Do you?”</p><p>“I think you’d look so <i>fucking good</i> carrying my baby.” Rio said, starting to pump again. “The image alone–”</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha whimpered, walls clenching around her wife’s fingers. “Fuck, fuck–”</p><p>“That’s it, baby.”</p><p>Her body tensed, body going slack once her orgasm dissipated. “We-we don’t have the money for a kid.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers stayed buried inside of her. “Straight people have kids with no money all the time. We’re already doing a lot better than most of them.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>Rio rolled onto her back, taking Agatha with her. She placed a hand on the small of Agatha’s back, helping her to get situated on top. “Not to brag, but my medical insurance is pretty kickass.”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha purred, hips rolling. “Keep talking dirty to me, love.”</p><p>“Covers IVF, genetic testing, fertility appointments…”</p><p>“Say shit like that and I’m gonna come again.”</p><p>“Almost nothing out of pocket…”</p><p>Yeah, Agatha came twice more that early morning, leaving her exhausted the rest of the day. But, it was worth it.</p><p>Rio saw Agatha in a way no one else ever had, or ever would. She was patient and loving, and spent those traits on Agatha for whatever deluded reason. She was cherished by her wife, and Agatha secretly thanked the universe or some unknown god for that every day.</p><p>Fate brought them together, and Agatha was grateful for it for fifteen years.</p><p>Well, thirteen.</p><hr/><p>“Mrs. Vidal?” The voice on the other end asked.</p><p>Agatha sat at her desk in between periods, physically recoiling at the use of her last name. She kept meaning to change it after the divorce, but just kept putting it off. She never liked the last name Harkness, it was her mothers.</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha answered, leaning back in her chair.</p><p>“I’m calling from your daughter’s school, we’re going to have to ask you and Nicky’s other mom to come down here.”</p><p>Her spine stiffened, shooting forward and leaning on her desk. “What’s wrong? Is she okay?”</p><p>“She’s fine, but she is in trouble. The principal is asking you to meet her as soon as possible.”</p><p>Trouble? Nicky got straight A’s. What fucking trouble?</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“Mrs. Vidal…she punched another student.”</p><p>Her daughter got Agatha’s fucking attitude alright.</p><p>She let out a sigh. “I’ll be there in an hour.”</p><p>After begging and pleading for one of her coworkers to watch her next class, Agatha hauled ass to her daughter’s middle school, striding down the hall towards the front office. She had called Rio, but no answer. Typical.</p><p>She rolled her shoulders back, cracking her neck before bursting through the door. Immediately seeing Nicky sitting in a chair near the secretary’s desk, ice pack on her knuckles. Across the room, another kid sat. Yikes, his face was <i>messed up</i>.</p><p>Agatha crouched down in front of her daughter. “You okay?”</p><p>Nicky, being her daughter, just nodded. She looked somewhat remorseful, but not upset. “I’m fine.”</p><p>“What the hell happened?”</p><p>“That guy was being a dick.” Nicky tilted her head towards the injured boy. “Pissed me off.”</p><p>“Easy there, scrapper.” Agatha grinned, “We only use violence when we know we won’t get caught.”</p><p>Nicky’s face pulled into a small smile, a light chuckle following. “Thought you’d be proud, I think I broke his nose.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, placing a soothing hand on Nicky’s knee. “I really hope his parents don’t sue.”</p><p>A door opened, the principal popping her head out. “Mrs. Vidal? A word?”</p><p>Working in the same district that her daughter was enrolled in, meant that she was already acquainted with most of the faculty. Including Nicky’s principal, Valentina Allegra de whatever. Agatha didn’t particularly care for the woman, her superiority practically leaked out of her.</p><p>She gave her daughter's knee a reassuring squeeze before following the  principal into her office, the door shutting behind her.</p><p>“Please, have a seat.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but did so.</p><p>“I’m sure you can understand why we called.”</p><p>She chuckled. “Yeah, I have a few ideas.”</p><p>“I won’t keep you long, I know it’s the middle of the school day.” Valentina insincerely smiled. “We just–”</p><p>The door clambered open, Rio sprinting through in her scrubs and jean jacket. Fuck, it was Novemeber and she wasn’t even in a winter coat yet.</p><p>“I’m here!” Rio announced, taking a seat next to Agatha. “Sorry, sorry.”</p><p>Valentina smirked. “That’s okay, <i>Dr. Vidal</i>. I know you’re busy saving lives.”</p><p>Agatha fought not to roll her eyes again, the amount of times women openly fawned over or hit on Rio throughout the years made her nauseous. Even while they were married, Nicky’s teachers, coaches, tutors, made their interest clear. Yes, Rio was a doctor, made good money, owned a nice loft, and was amazing in bed. But did every woman with a beating vagina have to recognize that?</p><p>“I was–” Rio laughed at herself. “I was actually performing surgery on a dinosaur.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha cocked her head.</p><p>“My patient, his stuffed dinosaur’s ear was loose. I sewed it for him so he could have it with him during his own surgery.”</p><p>Valentina fucking gushed at that. “That is <i>so</i> thoughtful of you. Those kids are lucky to have a doctor like you.”</p><p>“Yup, uh huh.” Agatha said. “So our daughter?”</p><p>“Right.” Valentina answered, though her eyes stayed on Rio. “She punched another student today during lunch.”</p><p>“Why?” Rio asked.</p><p>“The reason is unclear, but what is, is that your daughter is struggling.”</p><p>“Like, academically?” Agatha scrunched her face.</p><p>“No.” Valentina said. “We’ve noticed a change in Nicky over the past couple months, she’s more frustrated, quick to anger. Is something going on at home?”</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Agatha’s body deflated against the chair. “Uh, yeah.”</p><p>“Agatha’s been seeing someone.” Her ex wife happily supplied. “It’s been hard on Nicky.”</p><p>Valentina gave a sympathetic frown. “Poor girl.”</p><p>“Yes, we’re aware.” Agatha groaned.</p><p>“I’d recommend seeking some help.”</p><p>“Help?” Rio echoed.</p><p>“A therapist or counselor."</p><p>“You think Nicky needs therapy?” Agatha squawked. "She's not crazy.”</p><p>Valentina shrugged. “Therapy after parents splitting up and a new partner being introduced could help her. She’s always been an excellent student, so we’re willing to cut her some slack this time. But, I would urge you both to explore some resources.”</p><p>“Great.” Agatha hissed, standing. “Is Nicky free to go?”</p><p>“We’ll have you take her home today, but she’s welcome back tomorrow.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Rio chirped, standing and following Agatha out.</p><p>“Thank you, <i>doctor</i>.”</p><p>Keep it in your pants, lady.</p><p>Rio closed the door, exchanging a look with Agatha. Fuck, she thought the therapy was a good idea. Agatha shook her head, silently saying that they’d discuss it later.</p><p>It was Agatha’s week, so after calling the high school to let them know she’d be taking a half day, they collected Nicky and headed out to the car. Agatha unlocked it, letting Nicky get in the passengers side, hanging back to talk to her ex.</p><p>“You <i>honestly</i> think she needs therapy?!”</p><p>Rio cocked her head. “She’s yelling at you, she’s punching people…yeah, I do.”</p><p>“She’s a kid who’s going through something!”</p><p>“Yeah, and she shouldn’t have to do it alone, Agatha!”</p><p>“All a shrink will do is tell her that I ruined her life, which she is already aware of.”</p><p>Rio brought up a hand to rub her temple. “You didn’t ruin anything, a shrink could help her to see that. Hell, maybe it’d fix your relationship with her. I can’t be the bridge between you two forever.”<br/>
</p><p>And she knew it was mean but, “Like you don’t take a little pleasure in being her favorite.”</p><p>“No, I actually don’t!” Rio whisper shouted, mindful of Nicky in the car. “I hate it, Agatha! Our daughter is hurting, she’s struggling and we need to get her some help!”</p><p>“I can’t afford therapy.”</p><p>“Good thing I can.”</p><p>She fucking loathed when Rio did that, threw her money around. It made Agatha feel inadequate, like she couldn’t provide for her own child. It was bad enough she took money from Rio every month, now she needed to depend on her for this.</p><p>“Thank god for kickass insurance, right?” Agatha muttered, reaching for the door handle. “I’ll talk to her about it.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Rio checked her watch. “I gotta get back to the hospital, but call me tonight?”</p><p>“Can’t wait.” Agatha replied in a sickly sweet voice. “I look forward to it.”</p><p>Her ex wife just sighed, running around to the other side of the car and saying goodbye to Nicky before walking to her own car. Agatha got in, dropping the keys in her lap and looking at her daughter.</p><p>“Okay, seriously. What happened?”</p><p>Nicky held the melting ice to her bruised knuckles. “Nothing.”</p><p>“Teddy, I’m not mad, I just want to understand.”</p><p>Nicky turned her head, letting out a deep breath. “He was bullying a non verbal autistic kid, okay? Calling him names and slurs. And the teachers weren’t doing shit. And sue me, it pissed me off. He shoved the kid against the wall and nobody was doing anything!”</p><p>“Jesus, that’s some Disney villain shit.”</p><p>“I know! The kid started crying and no one blinked. I j-just got angry, okay? I won’t do it again.”</p><p>“Did you tell any of the teachers?”</p><p>“It was the first thing I did, but they said it was just ‘roughhousing’, boys will be boys type of stuff…”</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha mumbled, cautiously reaching out and placing her hand on Nicky’s forearm.</p><p>“It’s 2025, who bullies people in real life anymore? Have the decency to do it behind a screen, at least.”</p><p>“Assholes.”</p><p>“Am I in trouble?”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “No, but your mami and I do think it’d be good if you talked to someone.”</p><p>“Talked to someone?”</p><p>“A therapist, maybe.”</p><p>Nicky blinked, processing the information. “Why?”</p><p>“Teddy, things haven’t been okay lately, and I get why. But, you’re lashing out more, you’re angry all the time. It can’t be healthy.”</p><p>She expected her daughter to yell, to take offense, maybe even storm off. Miraculously, however, none of those things happened.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Okay?”</p><p>Nicky shrugged. “Better than being grounded.”</p><p>“Grounding would insinuate I don’t agree with your actions, I would’ve done the same thing.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Agatha picked up her keys, putting them in the ignition. “Oh, you have no clue the amount of men I’ve punched.”</p><p>“You sound proud.”</p><p>“I am, specifically of you.” She reached for the gearshift. “Let’s say we get some ice cream for you, bruiser.”</p><p>Nicky giggled. “I don’t think you’re supposed to reward me for this.”</p><p>“Definitely not and don’t tell your mami.”</p><p>“So, I get out of school early and get ice cream? Damn, mom. Thanks.”</p><p>And did her heart flutter at her daughter being nice to her? Sure. Was she being the best parent right now? No way in hell. But she had to take the small wins where she could get them. As she began backing out, her phone rang, bluetooth connecting to the screen on her dash, displaying Wanda’s name.</p><p>Fuck, this woman and her timing.</p><p>“What does Ethan Slater want?” Nicky muttered.</p><p>Agatha clicked the decline button. “Doesn’t matter.”</p><p>She’d call Wanda back, but right now, she had her kid. Nicky actually wanted to be around Agatha for the first time in months, she was holding onto this moment with a fucking chokehold.</p><p>Nicky fiddled with the screen, trying to find music. “How much Stevie Nicks have you loaded into this thing?”</p><p>“Just like every album, single, and live performance…”</p><p>“That might be gayer than your marriage to a woman.”</p>

<p>Rio rattled her keys around her finger, basically slumping up the steps to her townhouse. Her shift had been awful, losing a patient on hour thirteen of a fifteen hour shift. It was 7pm, the front porch left on by her wife for when Rio came home. The ice on the second step nearly taking her out completely, fuck she’s gotta salt that tomorrow.</p><p><b>December, 2011.</b></p><p>She slid her key into the lock, taking a moment before turning it. It’s not that she was avoiding going home, she was always happy to leave the day behind and focus on her wife. But they had been going through the process of getting Agatha pregnant for all of summer and fall. Rio had suffered through the hormone shots so they could go through with the egg retrieval, ending up with six embryos from ten eggs. The first embryo didn’t stick and they shrugged it off, knowing the likelihood of Agatha getting pregnant wasn’t high.</p><p>They had both gone through testing just to make sure they were healthy and wouldn’t run into any trouble trying to conceive. And while technically Agatha <i>could</i> carry, Jen was clear it would be harder for her. Rio was shocked, her wife had a normal cycle, nothing out of the ordinary, so when they got the news it made her falter.</p><p>There were things about her wife’s past that Rio knew she wasn’t aware of, Agatha’s childhood specifically. There were hints, the way Agatha’s left wrist was jutted out just <i>slightly</i> more than considered normal. To the common eye, nothing looked different, but Rio was a doctor, she knew what a broken bone that never healed properly looked like. There was the way Agatha ate, Rio would obviously never comment on it, but her wife did eat like her food would be snatched from her at any second. There was the way Agatha’s whole body went rigid whenever someone clapped even kind of near her head.</p><p>Rio never said anything, the context clues were enough.</p><p>But she did silently vow to herself that if she ever came across Evanora Harkness, that cunt was going to leave the scene in a fucking bodybag.</p><p>Because if Agatha was malnourished as a kid, it could explain why her body was struggling to carry a child now. So, they did another implantation with the second embryo–</p><p>No dice.</p><p>Rio comforted Agatha, letting her know it was nothing wrong with her and it would happen when it happened. And it worked up until the third embryo, when that test came back negative? Rio held Agatha on their bathroom floor as her wife sobbed, totally discouraged. And it hurt, it that Rio couldn’t fix it for her. She was literally a doctor, she fixed people for a living. But she couldn’t fix this.</p><p>So, as Rio stood with her key in the lock, she took a deep breath. They had just done another implantation with embryo number four and agreed to take the test together after Rio got home from work today. Hence her apprehension to go inside her home right now.</p><p>She was already so drained, having a child die in front of you kind of does that to a person. And she didn't know if she could be a good support for Agatha if another test came back negative. Working in pediatrics was great most days, kids are far more resilient than adults, but it also made the losses so much harder to take. There was a fine line between letting herself grieve appropriately and letting herself be consumed by it. Couldn’t go numb, but couldn’t get too invested either.</p><p>She turned the lock, opening the door and wiping the snow off the soles of her boots on the welcome mat.</p><p>“Baby?” Agatha’s voice called from the kitchen.</p><p>Rio took off her beanie and jacket, followed by her boots. “Hi.” She called back, shuffling down the hall.</p><p>“How was your day?”</p><p>“Fucking awful.” She turned the corner into the kitchen, finding her wife at the stove of all places. “You’re cooking?”</p><p>“I <i>do</i> know how.” Agatha quipped, dressed in a Mass Gen hospital sweater that she’d stolen. Rio got a lot of freebies with the hospital’s logo, which meant that they had Mass Gen mugs, mouse pads, sweaters, and pens. “Beer?”</p><p>“Uh, yeah.” Rio blinked, her wife seemed perky for whatever reason. “Special occasion?”</p><p>Agatha closed the fridge walking over and handing Rio the bottle, her face all rosy and cheery. “No, just felt like making sure you come home to a warm meal.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her gaze, twisting off the cap. Agatha didn’t really cook, she threw frozen shit in the oven and called it a day. And Rio <i>loved</i> her wife, hand to god, but anything Agatha did make was usually very underseasoned. Not her fault, she doubts that the monster who birthed Agatha knew how to properly season chicken, but Rio was cautious about whatever Agatha was about to serve.</p><p>“What are we having?” Rio asked, it smelled good in here, like garlic and herbs.</p><p>“My mom very graciously gave me her lasagna recipe.” Agatha checked the oven, setting the timer. “Don’t tell her I used store bought sauce, though.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, taking a sip. “Your secret is safe with me.”</p><p>“Why was today awful?” She asked, finally walking over and greeting Rio with a kiss.</p><p>“Lost a patient.”</p><p>Agatha’s face crinkled. “I’m sorry, baby.”</p><p>“Four years old.”</p><p>“Fuck.”</p><p>“Yeah, so…” Rio lifted her beer. “Good call on this.”</p><p>“Well, I think I know something that’ll cheer you up.”</p><p>“Cariño, I love you, but sex will not fix my mood–”</p><p>“It’s not that, c’mon.” She grabbed Rio’s wrist, leading them into the living room. It was the holiday season, so they had the tree up as well as all the kitschy Christmas decor.</p><p>Agatha sat Rio down on the couch, grabbing a small gift bag from underneath the tree. It had tiny dinosaurs with Santa hats printed all over, red tissue paper sticking out. She held it out in front of Rio, a small grin on her face.</p><p>Rio set her beer down, grabbing a coaster of course, Agatha didn’t appreciate rings on her Pottery Barn side tables. “Christmas isn’t for, like, three weeks.”</p><p>She shrugged. “Santa came early.”</p><p>Rio took the bag, quirking a brow as she did so. “Is this a pity present?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha chuckled, staring intently.</p><p>Rio pulled out the tissue paper, something fabric wrapped underneath all the layers. She set the bag aside, pulling at the paper. “New scrub cap?”</p><p>“I thought you liked Snoopy?”</p><p>“I <i>love</i> Snoopy. I’m just trying to figure out what you could’ve gotten me that would be <i>this</i> small.” Rio threw the rest of the paper elsewhere, a neatly folded square of white cotton revealed.</p><p>Rio’s fingers hooked under the fold, making it unravel. Her eyes widened as she read what the fabric said—</p><p>What the onesie said.</p><p>It had a drawing of Snoopy hugging Woodstock on the front, font below saying <i>The Vidals, est. 2012.</i></p><p>The onesie was for a newborn, meaning–</p><p>Rio finally looked up, tears in her eyes as it clicked. “You’re…”</p><p>“I ordered it when we first started trying.” Agatha’s smile took up her whole face, blue orbs going glassy as she nodded. “I couldn’t wait and I took a test this morning.”</p><p>Her jaw dropped, the tears coming out faster now. “You’re pregnant.”</p><p>“I’m pregnant.”</p><p>Rio dropped the onesie next to her, pulling at Agatha until she was in her lap. “<i>You’re pregnant.</i>”</p><p>Agatha laughed through her own tears. “We’ve established this.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you wait for me?” Rio questioned, her smile matching Agatha’s.</p><p>“I didn’t want to put you through all the crying again if it was negative.”</p><p>“Baby, you didn’t put me through anything.” She reassured, before trailing her gaze down to Agatha’s stomach. She splayed her hand on her wife’s lower abdomen. “My kid’s in there.”</p><p>Agatha only laughed harder. “You know damn well it’s only a bundle of cells in here.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio looked at her wife, who was currently sitting on her lap. “But it’s <i>our</i> bundle of cells.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands shot out to cradle Rio’s face. “I love you.”</p><p>“I love you too, mi alma. <i>So much</i>.”</p><p>“We have to come to a consensus about names now.”</p><p>“I just don’t see what’s so wrong with Luna.”</p><p>“I’m not naming my child after the moon!”</p><p>“The moon is cool!”</p><p>“Then you should’ve knocked up a different woman.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, bringing her hands to her wife’s hips. “No, I think I knocked up the right woman.” She smirked, dragging Agatha closer. “In fact, let me knock you up again.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “I don’t think that’s how that works.”</p><p>“No, it is. I’m a doctor, trust me.” Rio said, gently pushing Agatha so she was on her back, climbing on top of her. “If I work fast enough maybe we can go for twins.”</p><p>Agatha beamed, pulling her close. “Don’t make promises you can’t keep, my love.”</p><p>“Never.” Rio whispered, connecting their lips as her hand trailed under the waistband of Agatha’s sleep shorts. “Can’t let down the mother of my child.”</p><p>“I’m holding you to that.”</p><p>“Please do.”</p><p>Yeah, Agatha definitely did. Pregnancy did not treat Rio’s wife well. Throughout the following nine months, Rio never broke her promise. Agatha picked out nursery furniture? Rio built it. Agatha woke up in the dead of night craving a crunchwrap supreme? Rio drove to Taco Bell at 2am. Agatha was horny? Well, Rio was more than happy to oblige. Agatha was horny again? Rio was there, <i>happily</i>. Agatha was horny–</p><p>Yeah, pregnancy made Agatha kind of feral when it came to sex. Literally morning, noon, and night. Eventually it got to the point where Agatha would just greet Rio after work by telling her to go put on her cock. Which, Rio did <i>not</i> complain about. Her wife was fucking beautiful before pregnancy, but during? Yeah, it was a miracle they didn’t have to pry Rio off with a crowbar.</p><p>The downside was everything else. There were numerous occasions where Rio had to scoop Agatha off the bathroom floor and take her to the ER for dehydration. Her wife’s morning sickness was so intense that Agatha would drink something, and it would come back up still cold. Getting Agatha to keep anything down was also a challenge, Snoopy didn’t seem to like most food.</p><p>They called the baby Snoopy until they settled on a name, which took until month eight. Agatha was sprawled in their bed, huge shirt straining against her belly as Rio massaged her feet because those always ached. It didn’t help that Agatha’s third trimester was during the hottest time of the year. They didn’t even go to pride that year, Agatha was too uncomfortable standing in the sun.</p><p>“Camila.” Rio offered, thumbs digging into Agatha’s heel.</p><p>“Mmmm.” Agatha moaned, hands resting on her bump. “I like it, it’s pretty and it can be gender neutral as a nickname.”</p><p>Rio’s face scrunched. “Cam?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Nope, never mind.”</p><p>“Okay, Artemis?” Agatha offered, “Artie for short?”</p><p>“What’s up with you and Greek names?” Rio tilted her head. “And Artemis is terrible.”</p><p>“Fine.” She huffed. “I’ll keep thinking.”</p><p>“What about boy names?”</p><p>“We’re having a girl, my love.”</p><p>They found out as soon as humanly possible. Jen was Agatha’s OB and she very excitedly announced that they would not be contributing to the male population, which Rio was a little relieved by. She didn’t know how men worked, she had one brother but that was it. A girl was safer, she could relate to a girl.</p><p>“I know, but maybe we could pick a name from that list and make it work.”</p><p>“I liked August, but then I got an August assigned to my class and he’s a total prick. So, that name is ruined forever.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio laughed, still massaging. “I always liked Milo. We could do Mila?”</p><p>“That’s basically Camila, we’re back to square one.”</p><p>“Well, Snoopy is going to need a real name soon.”</p><p>“Oh my god!” Agatha sat up. “A few years back, I had a Nicholas in my sophomore English class and he was the sweetest boy ever. Kind, smart, considerate. Seriously, an angel. I had Nicholas on my list ever since then, but didn’t think we could use it. What about Nicola?”</p><p>“Nicola.” Rio tested it out, grinning. “Nicola Vidal.”</p><p>“Nicky for short, still gender neutral…”</p><p>“I think I’m stuck on Camila.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “What if Camila is the middle name?”</p><p>“Why does my pick get middle?”</p><p>Agatha cocked her head. “Sorry, who’s growing this child?”</p><p>She tucked her tongue against her cheek. “You are.”</p><p>“And will she not <i>also</i> have your last name?”</p><p>“She will.”</p><p>“So,” She raised a single brow, “I think that entitles me to the configuration of the name.”</p><p>“Nicola Camila Vidal.”</p><p>“Nicola Camila Vidal.”</p><p>“Sold.”</p><p>Nicky was born in September 2012, seven pounds, nineteen inches. Her wife’s labor was only a few hours, Rio joked that it was because Nicky had Agatha’s impatience. Agatha responded by crushing Rio’s hand, her <i>surgical</i> hand, on the next push. So labor is not a time for jokes, got it.</p><p>They laid in the hospital bed after, Agatha sweaty and shaky as she cradled their daughter, hair stuck to her face. Rio was next to her, peering down at their <i>perfect</i> baby girl. Her eyes took up most of her face, sparse brown hairs clinging to her head. Agatha trailed her index finger along Nicky’s cheek, smiling so hard Rio wondered if her face hurt. It must’ve, because Rio was wearing the <i>exact</i> same smile.</p><p>“Hi, little girl.” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“You did amazing, baby.” Rio said as she kissed her wife’s cheek. “She’s perfect.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze stayed glued to their daughter. “You let me down.”</p><p>“What?” Rio looked at her.</p><p>Agatha turned her head, giggling to herself. “Not twins.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, letting her body sink further into the bed. She might’ve let Agatha down, but as she watched her wife and child, something told her that it didn’t matter. They were everything to Rio–</p><p>And they always would be.</p><hr/><p>Agatha made a mental checklist in her head.</p><p>Nicky’s next dentist appointment.</p><p>Department meeting.</p><p>She <i>had</i> to go grocery shopping tomorrow.</p><p>And, shit, Nicky’s therapist left a message in the patient portal and Agatha hadn’t fucking read it yet.</p><p>“Are you close?” Wanda asked, popping her head out from between Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>Oh fuck, that’s right. Her moans must’ve stopped when she got distracted.</p><p>She was currently sprawled out in her bed, naked, with her girlfriend down on her knees and tongue between her thighs. This was <i>after</i> Agatha had so lovingly supplied her girlfriend with three ‘good morning’ orgasms, because fuck Rio, Agatha could be a giver.</p><p>Now, usually, Agatha had no problem speaking up when someone wasn’t fucking her correctly. But, it wasn’t even Wanda’s fault, any woman post-Rio couldn’t get the job done. Hell, it was why the booty calls occurred the second Agatha would become single again. It was never the woman, it was never the technique. It was her motherfucking ex wife.</p><p>“Mmmhh.” Agatha hummed, slinging an arm over her eyes. “Sorry, sweetheart.”</p><p>“It’s okay.” Wanda’s voice pitched higher, a lie.</p><p>Agatha would let her go for a couple of minutes before faking it and waiting for Wanda to disappear so she could get herself off. Any orgasm not induced by Rio, was due to her own hand or vibrator. Honestly, Wanda might stand a chance in hell in actually wringing an orgasm from Agatha if she clipped those damn talons and used her fingers. Some women didn’t like penetration, Agatha fucking <i>loved</i> it. She loved being full, she loved being <i>fucked</i>. But, Wanda didn’t want to wear a strap or cut two nails shorter, so that thought was a dead end.</p><p>“You want me to keep going?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Um–” Agatha’s phone rang, saving her from having to make the decision. She looked over, Rio’s caller ID lighting up her phone. “Shit, I gotta take this.”</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>“Need I remind you of the last time I ignored my phone and my daughter and ex wife barged in?”</p><p>Wanda stood, completely naked and hair mussed. “I’m going to shower. Join me after?”</p><p>Agatha gave a salute in acknowledgement, watching Wanda disappear into the bathroom and answering the phone. “Yeah?”</p><p>“Did you see the message in the patient portal from Nicky’s therapist?”</p><p>Therapy had been going well, Nicky had been seeing a doctor she really liked for a little less than a month now. The results spoke for themselves, she was less prone to lashing out, she fought Agatha less. Nicky was even able to be in the same room as Wanda and not insult her. Well, not insult her loud enough for Wanda to actually hear. It wasn’t a magical fix, but there was progress.</p><p>“Good morning to you too.”</p><p>“Morning.” Rio said, smiling. Agatha couldn’t see her, but she could still hear her ex wife’s smile crystal clear. That inflection, that tone.</p><p>“No, I didn’t.” Agatha let her free hand rest on her lower abdomen, brushing her scar. “Why, are we in trouble?” She grinned.</p><p>“We’re being asked to come in for her next session.” Rio said, “I think we’re being sent to the principal’s office.”</p><p>“What the fuck did we do?”</p><p>“Who knows, but I’m sure it’s all our fault.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Of course not, the parents are <i>never</i> to blame…”</p><p>“I don’t know, I think we kind of knocked it out of the park with Nicky.”</p><p>“She’s not fully formed yet.”</p><p>“She’s half you, she’ll be fine.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. If they were going by genetics, Nicky was not half Agatha. Nicky was half Rio and half an anonymous donor, but Rio never made it feel that way. And their daughter might be a spitting image of her ex wife, but Nicky’s personality? All Agatha. It’s not like biology was especially important to Agatha given that Lilia had no involvement in her creation, but she was still <i>her mom</i>. Just like Agatha was still Nicky’s mom and had the stretch marks to prove it.</p><p>“Where’s our child now?” Agatha asked, knowing it was Rio’s week.</p><p>“She went to Kamala’s house, they had a sleepover last night.”</p><p>So, their daughter was gone.</p><p>As was Wanda.</p><p>A horrendous, insane, and borderline creepy thought popped into her head. Her hand drifted further, fingers brushing the hair of her mons. Agatha was still worked up, and Rio’s voice was right here…</p><p>“So what did you do with your freedom?” Agatha quipped, pads of her fingers dipping lower.</p><p>“Uh, me and Alice went to a bar and had a few beers.”</p><p>“Mmmhhh.” She hummed, middle finger idly circling her clit. “Sounds riveting.”</p><p>“Oh, you have no clue.” Rio chuckled. “Afterwards, I came home and worked on my new LEGO set.”</p><p>“You animal.” She husked, running her middle and ring fingers through her slit collecting the wetness. “What set?”</p><p>God, is this what her life has become? Secretly jacking off to her ex wife’s voice, conversing about LEGOs just to get off?</p><p>“Five thousand piece Titanic.” Rio obliviously said. “The mast was a bitch.”</p><p>Mast.</p><p>A pole.</p><p>Long, hard, thick.</p><p>Fuck, yeah, this was pathetic.</p><p>She slowly sunk her digits into herself, picturing Rio’s instead. It didn’t mean anything, she was just trying to get herself off. Nothing more. It was better than cheating…right?</p><p>The shower was running, so she knew Wanda was occupied.</p><p>“W-why was it a bitch?” Agatha pumped her fingers. Finally, feeling close to full.</p><p>“It was in a billion tiny pieces, they could’ve made it in a way that just made more sense.”</p><p>Her eyes fluttered shut. “Hey, Rio?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“You remember when we took that cruise? I think Nicky was, like, three.”</p><p>Her ex wife laughed. “Fuck, and you got <i>so</i> sunburned.”</p><p>“Was bright red for a week.” She sped up her hand, canting her hips up.</p><p>“You pulled it off…especially in that bikini.”</p><p>“You kept calling me a MILF.”</p><p>“You were.” A beat of silence. “You <i>are</i>.”</p><p>Agatha curled her fingers, biting her lower lip not to moan. Her other hand clutching the phone like she was trying to strangle the damn thing. This was very morally gray, and for some reason, it only turned her on more.</p><p>“Thank god Jen and Alice went with us, I think they watched Nicky for a quarter of the trip just so we could–” She cut herself off. <i>So we could fuck like bunnies all over that fucking cruise ship.</i></p><p>“Yeah.” Rio agreed, her voice a little hoarse.</p><p>“Yeah.” She breathed out, adding a third finger and keening at the stretch. Her fingers were soaked, her legs were shaking. She was so <i>fucking</i> close. “Pretty sure I lost that bikini top in the Atlantic.”</p><p>“It was offending me.”</p><p>She curled her digits, hitting her g-spot over and over. “Rio.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Her stomach coiled, ready to snap.</p><p>She didn’t say anything, pretty certain her heavy breathing was taking up the conversation. She arched her back, her hand driving.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio’s tone went lethal. “What are <i>you</i> doing right now?”</p><p>“Bed.” She panted, “In bed.”</p><p>“Alone?”</p><p>“Mmmhh.” She confirmed, smothering another moan.</p><p>“And what are you doing…in bed….<i>alone</i>?” Rio knew, of course she fucking knew. She had spent fifteen years memorizing Agatha’s sounds.</p><p>“I- I’m resting.” She said, chest fluttering, breathing uneven.</p><p>“You’re a horrible liar when you’re about to come.”</p><p>“What are you insinuating?”</p><p>“You, my love, are touching yourself.” Her voice went gravelly, deep like it would when she <i>actually did</i> fuck Agatha. “Aren’t you?”</p><p>“You can’t prove that.”</p><p>“How many fingers?”</p><p>Eh, fuck it.</p><p>“Three.”</p><p>“<i>Shit</i>.” Rio whimpered, and Agatha could picture her ex perfectly. Probably in a tank top and boxer, still in her pjs. Maybe in her kitchen brewing coffee, or in bed reading. “What are you wearing?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>Rio must’ve felt physically pained by that, she hadn’t seen Agatha fully naked in years. Not since–</p><p>Well she preferred not to think about that right now.</p><p>It wasn’t that the scar made her insecure, Agatha was hot regardless. It was Rio plus the scar. She didn’t want Rio to look at or touch it, for what reason she couldn’t be sure, but her brain knew it was wrong.</p><p>Agatha was <i>dripping</i>, lewd sounds emitting into the room. “We- we shouldn’t do this.”</p><p>And it made it so much hotter.</p><p>“You started it.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah I did.”</p><p>“You wanna stop?”</p><p>“We <i>should</i> stop.”</p><p>“Not what I asked.” Rio went quiet for a moment before speaking again. “You pretending those fingers are mine?”</p><p>“Don’t ruin it.”</p><p>“C’mon, let me hear one moan.” She could picture Rio’s smirk. “You always sound so pretty.”</p><p>Involuntarily, a moan ripped from her throat. She threw her head back, neck vein popping. “<i>Rio</i>.”</p><p>“That’s it, angel.”</p><p>“Fuck, I gotta be quiet.”</p><p>“She nearby?”</p><p>“Shower.”</p><p>“Remember that time I fucked you in the shower at our old place? You were bent over, fucked out, gripping that bar…absolutely wrecked.”</p><p>“Yeah.” She nodded, reaching that edge, ready to fall.</p><p>“Pretty sure you took my whole fist, you were so <i>fucking</i> tight.”</p><p>She whimpered at the memory, wanting to relive it. “I still am.”</p><p>“Oh I know, querida.” Rio rasped. “You’re always so good, so perfect.”</p><p>“Say it again.”</p><p>“You’re so <i>good</i>.”</p><p>Agatha's body started to convulse. “Oh, fuck–”</p><p>“<i>My good girl</i>.”</p><p>Those words shouldn’t affect her anymore, they should mean zip. Because Agatha wasn’t hers, and Rio wasn’t Agatha’s. Not anymore. Not for years. She was dating someone else, she was having sex with someone else less than ten minutes ago. And yet—</p><p>Agatha dropped the phone, landing with a soft thud against her shoulder as she came. She shuddered as her walls clenched around her fingers, letting out a silent scream so as not to alert her girlfriend in the shower.</p><p>“Baby?” Rio’s voice faintly spoke, the phone languidly sliding into the crook of her neck.</p><p>What the fuck was Agatha doing?</p><p>She just used her ex wife to come.</p><p>And her ex wife was aware.</p><p>With her girlfriend in the fucking shower.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</p><p>She shot up, sliding her fingers out and–</p><p>Shit, they were drenched.</p><p>Dammit, shit, fucking bitch–</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio spoke again.</p><p>Agatha picked up the phone with the one not saturated in her own arousal, clearing her throat. “Sorry.”</p><p>“Sorry?” Rio echoed. “I’m not.”</p><p>“That was fucked up, to say the least.”</p><p>“But you feel better.”</p><p>It wasn’t a question. Rio already knew.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Then there’s nothing to be sorry for.”</p><p>“No, I- I shouldn’t have done that to you. I’m not putting you on hold.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Nothing.” Agatha sniffled, suddenly feeling very vulnerable. “Nothing, I should go.”</p><p>Rio didn’t even try to hide her disappointment. “Oh…okay.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“See you in therapy.”</p><p>Agatha almost laughed at the absurdity of it. “Yeah, see you in therapy.”</p><p>“Bye.”</p><p><i>Wish you were here.</i></p><p><i>Wish it had been you.</i></p><p><i>Wish it was you in that shower.</i></p><p>No. Absolutely not.</p><p>“Bye.”</p><p>Agatha hung up, throwing her phone like it had burned her skin.</p><p>“Babe?” Wanda called out. “You coming?”</p><p>Well, for the first time in a long time–</p><p>Agatha actually had.</p><hr/><p>Rio stared at her phone long after the screen had gone black. She stood in the kitchen, coffee machine beeping to signal her coffee was ready. But her brain didn’t register it, too focused on what the fuck had just happened with her ex wife.</p><p>Was it pathetic that Rio was really turned on right now?</p><p>How could she not be?</p><p>Was it wrong to go upstairs and furiously masturbate to the memory of that call?</p><p>Or was that desperate?</p><p>Agatha had sounded <i>so desperate</i>.</p><p>Which made her wonder what the everliving fuck Wanda was doing to her wife in bed. Yeah, Rio was already more than sure that Wanda couldn’t be what Agatha needed, but seriously? The sex was <i>that</i> bad?</p><p>Nicky wasn’t home…</p><p>Wouldn’t be for hours…</p><p>Eh, fuck it.</p><p>Rio bolted up the stairs, taking them two at a time and rushing into her room. She flung herself down, shoving her hand in her boxers. It was a better alternative to thinking about Agatha probably hopping in the shower with Wanda at this current moment.</p><p>Or whatever the fuck “I’m not keeping you on hold” meant.</p><p>No, instead she thought about that cruise and that bikini and how Agatha must’ve looked working her hand between her thighs. Rio bet she looked so fucking good, she was sure of it.</p><p>She thought about the sounds Agatha made, how Rio could tell she was close just from her breathing pattern. If Rio were there, the orgasm would’ve been better, more intense. Hell, she’d give her more than one.</p><p>And Rio wished she didn’t feel this fucking pathetic, didn’t feel this way about a woman who had no fucking interest in her. But then her mind reeled, replacing the guilt and the shame with Agatha. Agatha moaning and whining, whimpering and arching. Agatha’s face, her body.</p><p>Stupid fucking Wanda, she’s not worthy of seeing Agatha naked. That ginger obviously does not know what she’s doing, Agatha deserved better.</p><p>And then Agatha apologized after, like it was a bad thing.</p><p>Yes, Rio was taking scraps, but there wouldn’t be any scraps if Agatha was actually satisfied.</p><p>She gave that relationship two more months before Agatha got  too frustrated to pretend any longer. Rio could wait. She’d always wait for her wife.</p><p>Rio came in under three minutes, hand buried in her boxers, cursing a single name as she did so. “<i>Agatha.</i>”</p><p>The next day, Sunday, Rio and Nicky met Agatha at the therapist’s practice. Their daughter didn’t hug Agatha, but she did smile, so that was progress.</p><p>“Can I throw my bag in your car, mom?” NIcky asked, backpack slung over her shoulder. They figured since it was Sunday, Nicky would just go home with Agatha after the session.</p><p>Agatha handed her the keys. “Sure, hon.”</p><p>It was December and the parking lot was freezing, but that wouldn’t stop Rio. “How was your weekend?” She asked, grinning.</p><p>“Fine.” Agatha said, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>“Get good <i>rest</i>?”</p><p>“Rio.” She warned.</p><p>“I know I did, I think I <i>rested</i> three times after our call.”</p><p>Her ex wife’s pupils dilated, her breath hitching. “Good for you.”</p><p>Sick freak, Agatha was definitely turned on.</p><p>“You know, when I find that <i>resting</i> by myself is easier than <i>resting</i> with another person, I tend to analyze why that might be.” Rio smirked. “Maybe it’s a sign.”</p><p>“And who the fuck have you <i>rested</i> with lately?” Agatha narrowed her gaze in disbelief.</p><p>No one, literally not a single soul.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t know that.</p><p>And this could speed up Ronald McDonald getting the fuck out of the way so Rio could have her wife back.</p><p>After all, Agatha had always been a pretty jealous spouse. Not that she needed to be, Rio never so much as looked at another woman while they were married. Honestly, she still hadn’t. She was <i>stuck</i>.</p><p>“No one serious.”</p><p>“You’re dating?”</p><p>“I don’t know if one night stands count as dating, but…”</p><p>Bald faced lie.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes quickly shifted from lust to rage, maybe envy. “Nicky hasn’t said anything.”</p><p>“I’m not going to tell my daughter when I’m getting laid.”</p><p>“Well…” Agatha crossed her arms, blue winter coat on her body. “Happy you’ve moved on.”</p><p>“Figured it’s time.” Rio’s smile was sickeningly sweet. “Time to find <i>my</i>  Wanda…since you two are <i>so</i> happy.”</p><p>“Fuck you.”</p><p>“Name a time and place, baby.”</p><p>Agatha took a step forward. “I’m going to choke you out, so help me god.”</p><p>Rio leaned in, their respective spaces vanishing until they were almost flush with one another. “Please do.”</p><p>Agatha's car a few rows away beeped, Nicky having locked it with the key fob. “Okay!” Nicky called over. “Let’s do this shit.”</p><p>Agatha sobered at their daughter’s voice, taking a step back. “Yeah.”</p><p>Rio nodded, ignoring the longing that had calcified in her chest years ago. “Yay. Therapy.”</p>

<p>Smoke from a candle is flammable, the steady stream containing vapors. If you blow out a candle, then apply a match to the smoke, it ignites again. Even if the flame does not touch the wick again, its immediate combustion. This unsuspecting thing, lying seemingly dormant, ignited and lit aflame once more.  The fire burning bright and steady.</p><p>That was her and Rio.</p><p>Agatha kept striking a match, holding it out as the smoke curled and coiled around, threatening to catch flame. And if that smoke succeeded?</p><p><i>Combustion.</i></p><p>So, it was actually a good thing that ten minutes prior she had discovered her ex wife was fucking other women. Because that’s what she wanted, to be free. Agatha was adamant that Rio needed to stop pursuing her, so Rio fucking random sluts was great. It was the best thing for their co-parenting relationship, for Nicky, for their family. She just prayed that Rio didn’t actually like one of the bimbos enough to bring her to the next family dinner. And if her ex wife got an STI, well, maybe that’s a lesson learned.</p><p>“Thank you for coming in today, I know it is the weekend.” The psychiatrist greeted, sitting across from the three of them in a chair. “It is nice to get a background of the family.” She said, a thick Russian accent saturating each word. “I am Dr. Melina Vostokoff, as you know.”</p><p>Now, Agatha was in a relationship, and Wanda was obviously gorgeous. But this woman? <i>Fuck</i>. Full lips, big brown eyes, high cheekbones, luscious head of hair. If Dr. Vostokoff were Agatha’s doctor; she'd never miss a therapy session. She was also her <i>daughter’s psychiatrist</i>, so there were many reasons not to do anything about how hot this woman was, but Agatha could appreciate beauty.</p><p>“I have already met you,” Dr. Vostokoff pointed to Rio who was on the opposite end of the couch from Agatha, Nicky wedged in the middle. “Briefly.”</p><p>Rio had dropped Nicky off at her first appointment, and Agatha idly wondered if her ex wife <i>also</i> thought Melina was attractive. Shit, maybe Rio could sleep with her too. Since apparently she was just pulling women left and right.</p><p>Her ex wife politely smiled. “Yeah, hi.”</p><p>“You are mami, correct?” The doctor asked, a note pad in her lap and glasses on her nose. “The doctor?”</p><p>“That’s me.”</p><p>“Excellent.” Melina then pointed to Agatha. “And you are mom?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips spread into a straight line. “Yup.”</p><p>“Great.” Melina took off her glasses, straightening her posture. “My goal here today is to learn more about you. Nicky has graciously agreed to share her time and I hope that we can have a productive conversation about what your daughter has been struggling with. I will ask questions and for the sake of progress, please answer honestly.”</p><p>“Got it.” Rio nodded.</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha chirped.</p><p>“Now, I have heard Nicky’s perspective, but what would you two say caused your divorce?” Milena tilted her head.</p><p>Okay, so this woman had the delicacy of a flamethrower.</p><p>“Fuck, you don’t beat around the bush.” Agatha gawked.</p><p>“I find it counterproductive to waste time.” The doctor responded. “So, the reason for the end of your marriage?”</p><p>Agatha blew out a breath, noncommittally waving around her hand. “Irreconcilable differences.”</p><p>“Rio?” Melina checked.</p><p>Her ex wife simply said “I’d agree with that.”</p><p>“Liars.” Their daughter muttered.</p><p>Agatha looked at her, the fucking narc.</p><p>Milena raised her eyebrows. “Nicky.”</p><p>“It’s not true.” Nicky said, crossing her arms. “They were fine until Alex.”</p><p>Wow, she really thought she’d get more time before their dead kid was brought up.</p><p>Obviously, Dr. Vostokoff had the context of who Alex was, because she then flitted her gaze between her and Rio. “Is your daughter correct? Was the loss of your child the cause?”</p><p>Neither of them spoke, which didn’t shock Agatha because Rio hadn’t even uttered Alex’s name afterwards, she never fucking talked about Alex. When the room became heavy with silence, Melina sighed. “It is not uncommon for a marriage to suffer after the death of a child. Grief often perpetrates isolation, fear, rage, loneliness. And if what Nicky has told me is true, which I have no reason to question, you two had…unusual circumstances working against you.”</p><p>“What has she told you?” Agatha crinkled her brows.</p><p>“You should ask your daughter, not me.” The doctor nodded towards Nicky.</p><p>She turned her body, looking at her daughter. “Teddy?”</p><p>Nicky uncrossed her arms, her hands resting in her lap as she began to pick at her nails. “Just what happened, like, after…”</p><p>Rio turned her body too. “It’s okay, you can tell us.”</p><p>Nicky let out a breath. “I just…I just talked about how things went once Alex was gone. The house was quieter and even the sunny days were dark. Mami was always working and mom couldn’t get out of bed for, like, two months. I think nona basically raised me for a while.” She swallowed, voice going taut. “I know I was little, but you guys treated me like I was oblivious. And all the adults kept whispering, like a kid can’t tell when something is wrong. I guess… everyone was talking <i>around</i> me, but not <i>to</i> me.” She looked at Melina, silently asking if she should say the rest.</p><p>“You are doing great, keep going.” The doctor instructed.</p><p>“I think that I resented you guys.” Nicky’s voice broke. “And I think I still kinda do. You both lost a kid and each other, you both lost two people. But I lost my parents <i>and</i> my sister, I lost three people and neither of you acknowledged that. How I would feel about it. All I was told was that Alex had gotten sick and her body stopped working, I didn’t know what that meant or where my sister was.” She wiped a tear running down her cheek. “And my parents were there, but they <i>weren’t</i>. Mami stopped playing music when she cooked, and mom didn’t do the voices in the bedtime stories anymore. Hell, she couldn’t even tuck me in for, like, a month after.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes burned, the tears in her eyes matching her ex wife’s as their gaze met one another’s as Nicky kept going.</p><p>“I know it was hard on you guys, I get that. But I wasn’t stupid, I knew when mami started sleeping on the couch. I knew when mom spent her days sobbing in bed.” Nicky sniffled. “I remember one day, nona had picked me up from school and when I got home, I ran upstairs to show mom this picture I had drawn. And when I walked in,” Her daughter looked at her. “You were just hunched over, crying until you noticed I was there. You smiled and pretended everything was fine, and I <i>knew</i> it wasn’t.”</p><p>Her breath unintentionally caught at Nicky remembering <i>that day</i>, because Agatha remembered it too, and it broke her heart that Nicky picked up on it.</p><p>“I love you guys,” Nicky said. “But I <i>need</i> you to be honest. You didn’t stop loving each other, and it wasn’t irreconcilable differences. It was Alex. You guys aren’t who you used to be. Mami’s hiding shit, mom doesn’t even speak to aunt Jen anymore. I feel like my family isn’t mine, like even the good memories are from a different life.”</p><p>Fuck, that’s heavy for a thirteen year old.</p><p>And she hadn’t even been aware her daughter was feeling this way.</p><p>Agatha’s chest ached, like a dagger was just plunged into it. She wiped the tears brimming, sniffling and nodding. And though it hurt like a bitch to hear, the kid that was here now needed her. “Okay, hon.” She murmured, reaching out to squeeze Nicky’s hand.</p><p>“Of course, mi vida.” Rio agreed, a gentle hand on their daughter’s back.</p><p>“That was excellent, Nicky.” Melina smiled. “Did it feel good?”</p><p>Their daughter grinned slightly, using the back of her free hand to dry her face. “Yeah, it did.”</p><p>“So,” Melina plucked a tissue from a box, handing it to Nicky. “I will ask you two again, what caused the end of your marriage?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled everything in her lungs. “Alex’s death.”</p><p>The doctor looked at Rio. “Would you agree?”</p><p>“I think there’s more to it, but if we’re trying to find the root cause, then yeah.” Her ex wife spoke.</p><p>Agatha whipped her head. “What <i>else</i> could it be?”</p><p>Rio looked at her, face scrunched. “You blamed me.”</p><p>"Who else was there to blame?!”</p><p>“No one! There was no one person at fault!”</p><p>Agatha chuckled at the absurdity of that claim. “We had a deal, you broke it. We could’ve had time with our <i>child</i>, but you chose to take that away from me!”</p><p>“She would’ve died when she did, or a few days later! She would’ve been born sick, lived sick, and died sick.” Rio shot back, rage lacing each word. “And you blamed me because you needed to blame <i>someone</i>.”</p><p>“You don’t know she would’ve died! You’re not god!” Agatha stood off the couch, floodgates opening. “You fucking let me down! You were a coward!”</p><p>Rio stood up too. “I didn’t apologize for knowing better and it pissed you off! Your body was recovering and you <i>hated</i> that I was the person to depend on. You <i>hated</i> that I couldn’t fix things. You hated <i>me</i>!”</p><p>“Yeah, I might feel a little resentful of my wife who was supposed to protect our kid! Instead, you fucking took her from me!” Agatha screamed. “And you kept saying how sorry you were for Alex dying, but you never apologized for being the one to make the call!”</p><p>“I’m not!” Rio yelled, throwing her arms up. “I’m not sorry! I’m not going to apologize for making the correct decision! <i>Medically</i>, I made the right choice.”</p><p>“Fuck you! You <i>weren’t</i> the one cut open, and you <i>weren’t</i> the one who spent months making another body from scratch!”</p><p>“Excuse me!” Melina shouted, eyes darting towards their daughter on the couch. “I do not think that this is productive for Nicky.”</p><p>Nicky was hunched over, face in her hands. Her body was shaking as she cried, refusing to look up.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped. “I’m sorry. I’m-” She softly spoke as she sat back down. “I’m <i>so</i>  sorry, teddy.”</p><p>Rio slumped next to their daughter. “I’m sorry, mija.”</p><p>Nicky didn’t say anything, just let her hands drop before shooting her arms around Rio and burying her head into Rio’s chest. Which made Agatha feel <i>fine</i> and <i>normal</i> and not at all gutted that her daughter didn’t seek comfort from her. No, that was reserved for Rio who had never done anything wrong <i>ever</i> in Nicky’s eyes. Agatha bit her lip, crossing her arms and tearing her focus away from her ex wife consoling their daughter.</p><p>“It’s okay.” Rio whispered, placing a kiss to the top of Nicky’s head. “It’s okay.”</p><p><i>Fuck her</i>.</p><p>Fuck Rio and her superior bond with Nicky.</p><p>Fuck Rio and the women she was sleeping with.</p><p>Fuck Rio and her non-apology.</p><p>Melina’s eyes zeroed in on Rio’s hand cradling Nicky’s head. “I was unaware you were remarried.”</p><p>Rio looked up from their daughter. “I’m not.”</p><p>“You have a wedding band on your left finger.” Dr. Vostokoff noted.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t say anything.</p><p>“It’s my ring from…” Her ex trailed off. “I just feel comfortable wearing it.”</p><p>“Interesting.” Melina said, tone neutral. “Agatha, how do you feel about Rio wearing her ring?”</p><p>“I think it’s fucked up given the situation.” Agatha nearly snarled. “I think it gives Nicky false hope. I think it guilt trips me. I think Rio does it to look even more like a martyr.”</p><p>Did Rio keep it on when she had sex with other women? Where had that ring even been?</p><p>“Martyr?” The doctor echoed.</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth. “Everyone thinks that I’m in the wrong, that I’m the heinous bitch and Rio is the sad puppydog who was kicked out into the cold.”</p><p>“Are you referring to your daughter?”</p><p>Nicky looked up from Rio’s chest, brown eyes bloodshot.</p><p>Agatha weighed her options. She didn’t want to make her daughter feel worse, she didn’t want Nicky blaming herself. The word <i>Yes</i> was on the tip of her tongue, but she choked it back. “No.”</p><p>Melina squinted at her, pen scribbling. “We will say that, <i>for now</i>, your divorce was caused by the loss of your child.” She put her glasses back on. “How has the addition of a partner changed your family dynamic?”</p><p>God, another thing that would just circle back to Agatha?</p><p>“Um, not <i>positively</i>.” Agatha bit out, body rigid. “As I’m sure you can tell, neither my daughter nor ex care for my girlfriend.”</p><p>“Why do you think that is?”</p><p>“‘Cause she’s a bimbo.” Nicky muttered under her breath.</p><p>And she fucking <i>saw</i> Rio fight a smile, lips twitching.</p><p>Agatha scoffed, suddenly feeling like the punching bag in this session. “Because Nicky wants Rio and I back together.”</p><p>“Do you think that has something to do with you two relapsing into bed after break ups?” Melina inquired, surprisingly not judgmental in her questioning.</p><p>Agatha worked her jaw. “<i>Possibly</i>.”</p><p>“And why do you think that pattern occurs?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“What triggers it?”</p><p>Her daughter was in the fucking room for god’s sake, she couldn’t just say that she was in need of an orgasm and Rio was the most gratifying way to get one. She looked at Rio, who just looked back. Oh, so she just wasn’t going to be of any help?</p><p>Fanfuckingtastic.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Melina’s gaze trailed along all three of them, analyzing them. “Okay, here is what we will do.” She waved her pen around like an orchestra conductor. “I will continue to see Nicky every Wednesday and we will do family therapy on Sunday.”</p><p>“What?!” Agatha squawked.</p><p>“Wait-” Rio began.</p><p>“Additionally, I’d like to do a couple sessions with just the parents.” Dr. Vostokoff, ordered. “I recognize not everything is suitable for a child to hear.”</p><p>“You <i>think</i>, doc?” Agatha hissed.</p><p>“I do not usually focus on couples, more so the whole family unit.” Melina sighed. “But, to be frank, I think you need it.”</p><p>“How considerate and not at all patronizing.” Rio deadpanned, Nicky finally releasing her.</p><p>“I think it’d be good.” Nicky chirped.</p><p>“Hon, it won’t mean that we’re getting back together.” Agatha warned.</p><p>“God!” Nicky stood, grabbing her jacket. “And you just <i>love</i> reminding me of that!” She opened the door, storming out and slamming it behind her.</p><p>“The emotional impulses at her age are quite strong, it is not <i>always</i> a reflection of your parenting.” The doctor tried to comfort. “Emotions are big at that age, situations like this only amplify them.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped. “Sorry, what the fuck are we paying you for? As far as I can tell, I just spent the past thirty minutes being told how shitty I am!”</p><p>“Who said that, Agatha?” Melina calmly asked.</p><p>“It was implied!”</p><p>“Therapy is not a cure all. There is work you have to do.”</p><p>“Oh, fuck this. I’m finding my daughter and taking her home.” Agatha threw on her coat and rushed out the door, not even looking back to see if Rio was following. Honestly, she was probably hanging back to apologize for Agatha’s behavior.</p><p>The irony of Rio having the ability to apologize and just cherry picking when to do so.</p><p>Agatha stalked out of the building, scanning around for her daughter, finally finding her near Rio’s car. Nicky was pacing back and forth, clearly pissed.</p><p>“You okay?” Agatha said as she approached.</p><p>Nicky peered up, eyes filled with venom. “Living the dream.”</p><p>“Teddy, I didn’t mean to make it sound like I was rubbing salt in your wound.”</p><p>“Literally, all I did was agree, and you <i>had</i> to remind me that you still don’t want mami! Or our family back for that matter!”</p><p>“That’s not fair.” She shook her head. “I want us to be okay again, I came here today to try and be okay with you-”</p><p>“No, what’s not fair is you screaming at mami before she could even explain herself!”</p><p>And therapy was supposed to <i>help?</i></p><p>Also, Rio yelled too. Why was her thirteen year old only scolding her?</p><p>“I shouldn’t have raised my voice, you’re right.” Agatha deflated, sprawling out her arms. “But, Nicky, what do you want from me?”</p><p>“I want you to pretend you actually care! About me, and mami. <i>I want my family back!</i>”</p><p>“Baby, I care about you more than anything else in the universe. And I’ll always care about your mami.” Agatha gently told. “But you can’t punish me like this forever. You’re entitled to what you feel, but it’s unrealistic to blame me for everything. Your mami is an adult, she’s moving on. I’ll do therapy for the rest of my waking days if that's what you need, but I- I can’t just act like nothing happened. I promise you, we’d be worse off.”</p><p>Nicky shoved her hands in her coat pockets. “And you get to make that call? You get to decide everything for us? You decide when it’s time to move on? You decide when a stranger comes to family dinners and how I behave?”</p><p>“No-”</p><p>The crunch of the snow beneath Rio’s boots ceased as she reached the two of them. “Everything good?”</p><p>Nicky huffed. “I’m staying at mami’s tonight.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to rip out her own hair. “No, you’re not.”</p><p>“Yes, I am.”</p><p>“No, I told you, staying over there when you know it’s my week would not be a regular thing.”</p><p>“Another thing <i>you</i> decide!”</p><p>“It’s what the custody agreement decided.” Agatha raised her brows. “Take it up with Massachusetts family court.”</p><p>Nicky looked at Rio, pleading. “Mami, <i>please</i>.”</p><p>“When has that <i>ever</i> worked?” Rio narrowed her gaze. “It’s not my night, you’ll go with mom.”</p><p>“I don’t want to, I wanna stay with you.”</p><p>At what point does Agatha give in, admit she’s a terrible mom, and accept defeat? Perhaps she was just predisposed to be an awful parent, something in her genetic code that makes Harkness women miserable hags. Maybe the answer to that will be at the bottom of a bottle of wine later tonight, she wistfully thought.</p><p>“Mija, you have been with me the whole week and your mom misses you.”</p><p>“How? I’m sure she had that walking Cheeto to keep her company all week!”</p><p>“Okay!” Agatha shouted. “Enough! We’re going home, which is where you are legally bound to be for the next seven days. You’re angry, congratulations, so am I. You can be pissed at me all you want in your room at <i>my</i> house.”</p><p>“Seriously?!” Nicky yelled, searching for Rio to help.</p><p>Her ex wife shrugged. “Seriously.”</p><p>“So that’s it?!”</p><p>Agatha unlocked her car a few rows down. “No, it’s not. Get your ass in the car while we work out a schedule for therapy.”</p><p>“Neither of you even care how I feel!” Nicky stomped off, flipping them the bird as she did so. “Fucking fascists!”</p><p>“Inaccurate insult, hon!” Agatha called after.</p><p>Once the car door had been very <i>loudly</i> slammed shut and her daughter could no longer see them, Agatha crumpled, rubbing her temples. “When do things get better?”</p><p>“About 10 years from now when she realizes how much of a dick she’s being.” Rio chuckled, reaching out to place her hand on Agatha’s arm.</p><p>She flinched, pulling away. “Don’t…don’t touch me.”</p><p>Rio’s hand recoiled, her face morphing into hurt. “Sorry.”</p><p>“It’s fine.” She dismissed. “I just think we should stop.”</p><p>“Stop what?”</p><p>“This.” She motioned between the two of them. “Therapy might be a bitch, but one thing that has become <i>painfully</i> obvious is that we can’t do this back and forth. It’s too hard on Nicky, and it confuses her.” It also really confused Agatha. “I’m sorry for yesterday and I’m sorry for all the other times prior. I’m with Wanda, you’re seeing people. It’s- it’s not healthy.”</p><p>Her ex wife’s face went blank, devoid of emotion. “Got it.”</p><p>“Rio, I really am sorry.”</p><p>“I know.” Rio unlocked her own car. “Maybe just text me about the therapy schedule. I’ll see you next week.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Have a good night.” Her ex wife said, walking away. “Don’t forget, Nicky’s piano teacher moved her lesson from four to five on Tuesday.”</p><p>Agatha watched as Rio got into the car, starting it and backing out before it even had time to warm up in the Boston winter.</p><p>She groaned, rolling her shoulders. How the fuck was she in a worse place with both Nicky and Rio after less than an hour? Why the fuck was everything her fault? And they have the audacity to wonder why she might want a moment in her life with someone who didn’t see her as the cause of all of life’s problems.</p><p>Wanda didn’t do that. Wanda listened and was sweet and did make her feel bad. And why would Agatha discount that? So she can get off? It wasn’t worth the risk of doing more damage to the relationship with her daughter, the shambles she had left anyway.</p><p>And Rio was spending her free time in stranger’s beds, Agatha might as well be a drop in the fucking bucket. Rio was a big girl, she’d get over it. Shit, Agatha could fucking <i>feel</i> the hot flash starting boil beneath her skin, a lovely symptom of early onset menopause. Another <i>amazing</i> genetic predisposition that the Harkness women harbored. She ran a hand through her hair, slowly making her way to the car. She got in, put the key in the ignition, and put the heat on blast. For Nicky’s sake, not hers, she was ready to tear her jacket to shreds in t-minus two minutes.</p><p>Her daughter was looking out the window, fists rolled tight.</p><p>“Chinese sound good for dinner?”</p><p>Nicky scoffed. “Gross.”</p><p>“You love Chinese.”</p><p>“No, I don’t.”</p><p>Yes, she did.</p><p>“Fine, I think there’s a pizza in the freezer.”</p><p>“Not hungry.”</p><p>“You gotta eat.”</p><p>“I think I’d just throw it all up.”</p><p>“Well, try.”</p><p>“That’s rich coming from you.”</p><p>God, Agatha was going to regret asking this, but “What’s that mean?”</p><p>“Telling me to try when all you’ve done is give up.”</p><p>She switched the gearshift, shoving down the urge to bawl because her teenage daughter was being mean to her. “Chinese it is.”</p><p>Later that night, after dinner (which Nicky barely ate), Agatha got into bed. She was reading her book with a glass of wine in her hand when her phone rang on the nightstand. She reached over and picked it up, pressing the phone to her ear. “Hi, hon.”</p><p>“Hey.” Wanda greeted. “Rough day?”</p><p>“Why do you say that?”</p><p>“Something in your voice.”</p><p>“Therapy was…<i>a lot</i>.”</p><p>“Why is that?”</p><p>“Oh the usual, I’m a witch who’s responsible for the downfall of everyone's life.” Agatha bitterly joked, pushing her glasses to sit atop her head. “I think I’m failing at this.”</p><p>“At what?”</p><p>“Motherhood. My own daughter hates me.”</p><p>“She doesn’t hate you, babe.” Wanda said. “She just doesn’t know what you went through. And grief lingers. I remember when I lost my brother, I’d lash out on anyone who tried to help me. It’s temporary. And I know without a shred of doubt, you love that girl more than anything.”</p><p>Her lips curled upwards, the much needed praise going to her head quicker than the wine. “I really wanna believe you.”</p><p>“Agatha, trust me, the way you care about Nicky is one of your most attractive qualities.”</p><p>“Oh?” She smirked. “Go on, tell me more.”</p><p>“Your hair, for one-”</p><p>Agatha idly heard the sound of the fridge being pried open downstairs and the footsteps of her daughter walking upstairs. The final noise being the soft <i>click</i> of her bedroom door. Taking it as a win that Nicky was eating the leftover lo mein, even if she thought Agatha wouldn’t notice.</p><p>So she laid back, letting someone who loved her fawn over her. She let Wanda make her feel better. Agatha was done. She was putting the matches back in the drawer and letting the smoke dissipate. She was walking away altogether, leaving the candle to gather dust. She was leaving Rio behind and looking forward, onwards to a life where she wasn’t always the villain, where she didn’t have the weight of the fucking world on her shoulders.</p><p>And maybe that life was with a beautiful woman, one who was happy to ease her suffering. Maybe that life was with Wanda, and maybe it was good.</p><p>Either way–</p><p>Agatha was <i>finished</i> playing with fire.</p>

<p>Agatha was covered in various fluids, all courtesy of her infant daughter, gently swaying back and forth in the rocking chair. And while Agatha knew having a newborn wouldn’t be <i>easy</i>, she also didn’t consider that she’d feel like she was constantly fucking everything up. Nicky cried? Agatha ran through the list of every possible need she could fulfill. Nicky still cried? Agatha tried the soothing methods in the parenting books she had spent the last nine months memorizing. Nicky <i>still</i> fucking cried? Well, that's when Agatha would cry too.</p><p><b>November, 2012.</b></p><p>It didn’t help that Rio was at work for twelve to fifteen hours at a time. Her wife had taken off a month before going back to work, Agatha opted to just return to teaching after Christmas break. Not the ideal solution, but the public school system offered shit maternity leave and at least Rio’s paycheck would keep them afloat for a few months while Agatha stayed home. Yes, she recognized the privilege in her partner making enough to support the three of them, but being the primary caregiver was fucking exhausting.</p><p>Her mom came over often to help, Lilia was retired and would be watching Nicky most days when Agatha went back to work eventually. Agatha’s mom worked a boring corporate job for most of her life until one fateful day in 1980 where she took a chance on some brand new stock from an obscure tech company. The company? Apple. At twenty-two dollars a share, no less. Inflated for 2012, that’s sixty-one dollars a share. Needless to say, Lilia was comfortable. She then used her money to invest in more start-ups, weirdly finding the most success with a leggings company. Lilia had explained to Agatha that since she was loaded, she started fostering since she never had any kids of her own. Hence how she became gifted with Agatha’s presence in her life.</p><p>Or cursed with.</p><p>Lilia had gone home hours ago, making sure Agatha was fed before she did so. Her mom <i>loved</i> and <i>fawned</i> over Nicky constantly, but never let Agatha forget “You’ll always be <i>my</i> baby, tesoro mio.” Which she rolled her eyes at because she was a thirty year old woman, but let the sap make her lunch anyway.</p><p>Her head lolled back against the soft cushioning of the chair, keeping it swaying lest her daughter realize and get pissed enough to wail again. Nicky was a good baby, she was, but she was particular. She always needed to be in physical contact with someone, her bassinet was a personal offence to her for some reason. And Agatha was more than happy to let her daughter drift off to sleep in her arms, god knows Evanora let Agatha rot away in her crib until she had the ability to crawl or walk. She didn’t take for granted that she had her daughter safe, slumbering against her chest, the house quiet though an absolute mess.</p><p>After how hard pregnancy was, after her body struggled to do the one thing Agatha wanted it to do, she was grateful. However, that didn’t mean her tits weren’t aching from breastfeeding, or her stomach wasn’t rumbling because she hadn’t had anything to eat since her mom left. Or that Agatha’s hair was greasy and tied up because she didn’t have any energy to wash it, or that the t-shirt she currently wore didn’t have spit up, milk, and possibly pee on it.</p><p>She glanced over at the clock in their bedroom, they’d transition Nicky to the nursery in a few months, it was just after 9PM. Rio’s shift had started at five this morning, so she should be home any–</p><p>The front door creaked open downstairs, soft shuffling noises followed by the squeaking of the steps as her wife ascended the staircase. Rio appeared a minute later, the light from the hallway bleeding into the nearly dark room. Her wife had changed back into her street clothes, smiling as she locked her gaze onto Agatha and their daughter.</p><p>“There are my girls.” She whispered, delicately walking over so as not to wake Nicky.</p><p>“Hi.” Agatha said, voice laced with fatigue.</p><p>“Hi, mi amor.” Rio crouched down in front of the chair, giving Agatha a kiss before placing one on Nicky's head, greeting their daughter with “Hi, princesa.”</p><p>“How was work?” She asked, eyes heavy.</p><p>Rio noticed, of course she did. “It was fine. What about your day? When was the last time you slept? Or ate?”</p><p>“Uhhhh,” She tried to think back. “I don’t…honestly, the hours blur together.”</p><p>“Okay,” Her wife gently nodded. “How about I take Nicky and you lay down.”</p><p>“No, it’s–”</p><p>“You lay down, and when you wake up I’ll make you something to eat.” Rio’s hands covered her own where she was supporting Nicky’s body.</p><p>“You just got <i>done</i> taking care of babies for sixteen hours–”</p><p>“Yeah, and now I’m going to take care of my own.” Rio said, taking Nicky into her arms. “Plus, you” Rio looked down at their daughter, half asleep now. “are my favorite baby in the whole wide world.” Rio’s hand cradled the back of her head, thumb running along Nicky’s scalp. “Isn’t that right, mi vida?”</p><p>Agatha deflated in the chair. “I think I’ll nap here.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “You’re gonna fuck up your neck and back.”</p><p>“At least it’d distract from how sore my tits are.”</p><p>“You use the nipple cream?”</p><p>“Oh, you mean the <i>one thing</i> that gives me any sort of relief?” She gasped in faux shock. “Gee, I hadn’t thought about that. You should be a doctor or something.”</p><p>Her wife simply blinked at her, a small grin playing at her lips.</p><p>“God.” Agatha sighed. “I’m tired.”</p><p>“So, sleep.”</p><p>“There’s laundry, and dishes–”</p><p>“I got it.” Rio stated, swaying her body in place to coax NIcky back into sleep. “I’ll sterilize your pump so you can stockpile some milk after you eat…and maybe shower.”</p><p>“I think she peed on me at some point but I don't know when.”</p><p>“Sleep, eat, pump, shower.” Her wife listed off. “Get some rest, baby. You deserve it.”</p><p>“What about you?”</p><p>“I was able to get a little sleep in the on-call room, I’m good.”</p><p>She stood, shuffling to their bed. Shit, she forgot to wash their sheets today. “I love you.”</p><p>Rio climbed in on the other side, situating Nicky on her chest. “I love you too.”</p><p>Agatha’s head hit the pillow, dead to the world the minute it happened. Unaware of how fucking exhausted she was until she woke up a few hours later, around midnight. Her eyes begged to close again, but her stomach growled and her breasts hurt in a way that let her know they would explode if she didn’t get the fucking milk out soon. Rio wasn’t there anymore, but by the grace of god, Nicky was sound asleep in her bassinet.</p><p>She cautiously rose, tiptoeing across the hardwood floor and out into the hall. The first thing she noted was the smell of something cooking, her wife was a fucking amazing chef and Agatha was ready to devour whatever the hell was being made with the ferocity of a lion consuming its prey. Agatha went downstairs, sleepily walking into the kitchen.</p><p>Rio had music lowly playing, standing at the oven. Agatha looked over to the sink, now free of dishes, the baby bottles cleaned and left to dry nearby. She sat at the island, her wife peeking behind her to look at Agatha. “Good morning, hermosa.”</p><p>Her face hung slack with sleep. “I do not feel gorgeous.”</p><p>“Too bad.” Rio pulled out a few bowls from the cabinet. “You look it.”</p><p>“Where’d you put my pump? I think I’m going to start leaking soon.”</p><p>“In the bathroom off the den,” Rio scooped some food into a bowl, sticking a fork in the macaroni and cheese she had made. She put it in front of Agatha before taking off. “I’ll grab it. You eat.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and picked up the fork, taking a bite. And Rio didn’t just make boxed mac n’ cheese, no, she had obviously made some sort of roux with different blends of cheeses and spices to then pour over the noodles. Fuck, the salt and carbs were just what she needed in this very pitiful moment.</p><p>Her wife returned, setting the pump down. “Good food?”</p><p>She nearly moaned. “So good, thank you baby.”</p><p>Rio got a bowl for herself before sitting next to her, watching as Agatha lifted her shirt and situated the pump on her breast, then let her shirt drop back down before shoveling more food into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha was peacefully eating whilst being milked like a cow when she felt her wife’s gaze, she turned her head, a muffled “What?” coming out through the pasta she was chewing.</p><p>“You’re a vision, you know that?”</p><p>“Fuck off.”</p><p>“I mean it! You’re kind of kicking ass at the mom gig.”</p><p>Agatha grinned, a light blush forming on her face. “Shut up.”</p><p>There was a soft sound from the baby monitor and they froze, waiting for a cry. After a beat, it seemed Nicky was just stirring for a second, the monitor going quiet again.</p><p>“Fuck, that was scary.” Agatha murmured.</p><p>“Getting her in that bassinet was like defusing a fucking bomb.”</p><p>“I’ll take it as a compliment that she clings to us, but damn, we’re living in terror from a two month old.”</p><p>Rio smiled, shrugging. “Just means she loves us.”</p><p>“I hope she never stops.”</p><p>“What? The clinging or the love.”</p><p>“Both. Either.”</p><p>“She won’t, she could never.”</p><hr/><p>So, therapy is a fucking scam.</p><p>Rio was striding down the halls of the hospital on Monday morning, replaying all of yesterday. Growing up, Rio’s family suppressed their emotions. Angry at someone? Keep that shit bottled up, it would go away eventually. So, therapy wasn’t really her schtick. Rio could appreciate it, she was glad her daughter felt comfortable participating. But that fucking doctor? Oh, Rio couldn’t fucking stand her. She had told Dr. Vostokoff as much after Agatha had left the room to chase after Nicky. Telling her how inappropriate she thought it was to rehash their divorce in front of their daughter. The therapist simply shrugged and told Rio that therapy wasn’t always easy.</p><p>Yeah, Rio had gotten that much from just one session. She appreciated that Nicky could voice her concerns, but everything else? Disaster. Rio also didn’t appreciate how everything was insinuated to be Agatha’s fault, sure Rio had gotten a little heated, but nobody was at fault. And Rio might despise Wanda, but she didn’t need to see her wife raked over the coals for it.</p><p>And possibly the worst atrocity to come out of therapy, Agatha cut Rio off. Rio supposed she should take it on the chin and agree, because it wasn’t healthy nor was it good for Nicky. But damnit it all to hell, Rio <i>really</i> enjoyed having sex with her wife. And though she was not confident Agatha would keep her word, Rio would respect it anyway. She’d always wait for Agatha, even to her own detriment, even to a fault.</p><p>She turned a corner, hands in the pockets of her white coat, ready to forget yesterday. The hospital was her happy place. Whatever was going on outside of it could be ignored, Rio could fix people when she couldn’t fix her life. A way to set down her baggage and do some good for other people. And maybe it was how draining yesterday was, but Rio needed to do some good. Her whole body was kind of achey, her hands clammy, and her stomach nauseous. A very probable physical manifestation of being denied the prospect of ever fucking Agatha again.</p><p>Holy shit–</p><p><i>What if</i> she never fucked Agatha again?</p><p>That was a reality Rio did not want to live in.</p><p>Okay, she had to stop thinking about that and focus on today. And today was a very good day, it was Billy’s surgery day. The boy had waited two months to come back and get this bone marrow transplant, the Kaplan’s health insurance fighting tooth and fucking nail not to cover it. Additionally, Billy’s parents both worked around the clock to pay off the astronomically high medical bills and commuted from New Jersey so that they could see Rio. The American healthcare system, what a gem that it was.</p><p>She ignored her body’s internal temperature burning her alive and plastered on a smile even though it wouldn’t be seen because of the mask sitting on her face. Due to Billy’s high amount of chemotherapy, his immune system was fragile, meaning everyone masked up. Rio had made a joke to Alice about masking up vs. already being ‘masc’d up’...Alice didn’t laugh.</p><p>Rio and Alice didn’t work together on <i>all</i> cases, but most. They had a good work flow, they trusted each other. Additionally, they’d also have a resident assisting today.</p><p>“Hey, little dude, how are we feeling?” Rio asked as she approached Billy’s bed in his room.</p><p>The boy was small, gray, and bald. Though, kids are much more optimistic than adults, so he smiled beneath his own mask and said. “Good.”</p><p>“That’s good.” She chirped back, shuffling over to introduce the resident next to her. “This is my friend, Dr. Belova. She’s going to be helping me today with your surgery.”</p><p>Yelena was a strong resident, competent and capable. Though her disposition with other staff and adults was blunt and frank, she became surprisingly gooey around kids. “Hi, Billy.” Yelena waved and pointed to the stuffed animal he was clutching against his chest. “That is a <i>very</i> cool dinosaur.”</p><p>He beamed, holding it up for her. “Rio gave him to me and she fixed his ear! He got surgery just like me!”</p><p>“You two have so much in common!” Yelena matched his excitement. “You must tell me his name.”</p><p>“Tommy.” He said very matter of factly.</p><p>“That is an excellent name.” Yelena tilted her head.</p><p>Rio chuckled. “We’re gonna let them prep you and then we’ll see you later, okay?”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rebecca sat next to him, trying to sound polite though Rio couldn’t blame her for being exhausted. “Thanks, Dr. Vidal.”</p><p>“Anytime.”</p><p>As Rio left the room, she felt woozy, the world tilting on its axis. She stumbled, slumping against the wall in the hallway. Fuck, was she that pussy whipped? Was this withdrawal symptoms? Yelena tried to steady her, pulling down her own mask to speak. “Are you okay, Dr. Vidal? You don’t look so good.”</p><p>She pulled down her mask, a waterfall of spit in her mouth. “I’m fine.”</p><p>“You are sweating.” Yelena raised a hand and placed it on Rio’s forehead. “And you are burning up.”</p><p>“No, I- I’m-” She tried to swallow, but it had the opposite effect. She scrambled, sprinting to the nearest trashcan as her gut twisted mercilessly. She dropped her head, upchucking into the garbage as Yelena gave her back a pity pat.</p><p>“I think you are sick.”</p><p>“No, no I’m not.” Rio heaved out before vomiting again.</p><p>“Oh, so this is normal? You do this everyday?”</p><p>“I <i>can’t be</i> sick. Billy is long overdue for this fucking–” Her phone in the pocket of her scrub pants rang. Rio pulled it out, reading Agatha’s caller ID. She groaned, using her sleeve to wipe the excess saliva from her lips and answering it. “Yeah?”</p><p>“I just picked up Nicky from school.” Her ex wife informed, obviously on speaker phone in the car.</p><p>“Did she punch someone again?!”</p><p>“What the fuck?” Nicky’s voice carried.</p><p>“No,” Agatha breathed out. “She threw up during fourth period, she’s got the stomach flu. And if <i>she</i> has it, then…”</p><p>“Oh, fuck.” Rio whined, leaning against the wall and ripping off her mask. “Damnit.”</p><p>“Kamala also has it.” Nicky croaked.</p><p>The sleepover.</p><p>“Yeah, so.” Agatha spoke. “Just wanted to let you know since I thought you wouldn’t want to be patient zero in the PEDs wing.”</p><p>“Thanks, I uh–” She looked at Yelena. “I’m gonna have to go home.”</p><p>“You upchuck?” Agatha asked, a teasing lilt to her voice.</p><p>“...Yeah.”</p><p>“You cannot drive like this.” Yelena said. “Can you get a ride?”</p><p>“I’ll be fine. I can–”</p><p>Yelena snatched her phone. “Hello, Dr. Vidal’s ex wife, you need to come get her.”</p><p>“Excuse me?” Agatha said.</p><p>“She is vomiting everywhere and should not operate an elevator let alone a vehicle.”</p><p>“Yelena!” Rio scolded.</p><p>“I will walk her out front, I assume you know the location.”</p><p>“God.” Agatha sighed. “Yeah, gimme ten minutes.”</p><p>Yelena hung up the phone and gave it back to Rio. “Dr. Wu-Gulliver and I can handle Billy, go home.”</p><p>And Rio could’ve fought, but there was no point. She agreed and slowly made her way to go change out of her scrubs, Yelena escorting her out of building to wait out front for her fucking ex wife to pick her up. Besides not being there for Billy, having to get a ride from Agatha was easily the worst part of today. Rio didn’t want to see her, she had planned not to see her for another six days in order to give herself time to not seem so utterly pathetic. Because she’d always be there, ready and willing, letting Agatha drag her around at her leisure. And while the metaphorical leash <i>hurt</i>, Agatha snapping that tether altogether was akin to cracking Rio’s chest open.</p><hr/><p>Agatha pulled up to the curb, her ex wife and a blonde woman she had never met before standing out front. Rio looked like shit, pale and sweaty, glassy eyes. She unlocked the doors as Nicky climbed in the back, literally flinging herself over the center console.</p><p>She looked at her daughter. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“I need to lay down.” Nicky said, sprawling out.</p><p>“Oh, <i>suddenly</i>, you need to lay down?”</p><p>Nicky grinned big despite her appearance matching Rio’s. “Yup.”</p><p>Rio opened the door, gingerly sitting in the passenger seat. “You didn’t need to move for me, mija. I could’ve taken the back.”</p><p>“I don’t mind.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her shoulders back. “So, your place?”</p><p>Or would her ex wife rather be dropped off at a hypothetical girlfriend’s apartment so <i>that</i> woman could nurse Rio back to health?</p><p>Rio sniffled. “Yeah, that’s fine-”</p><p>“No.” Nicky quickly sat up. “Mami’s coming home with us, we can quarantine together.”</p><p>“Hon.” Agatha started, pulling away from the curb.</p><p>“Nicky.” Rio began at the same time.</p><p>And as soon as Agatha got onto the road, Nicky clutched her stomach. “Well, I don’t think I’m gonna make it another stop before I ralph again…”</p><p>“Mi vida, I beg of you, do not throw up in the car.” Rio groaned, holding back a gag. “If you do, then I will–”</p><p>“Nobody is puking in my car!” Agatha told. “Fine, we’ll go home and you can both spew your guts out there.”</p><p>“How are you not sick?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I’m a teacher, I’m exposed to every strain of every germ in the greater Boston metropolitan area on a daily basis.”</p><p>“Or you’re in the incubation period.” Her ex muttered.</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>She chose to ignore that, and Rio’s presence until they got home, ushering two very sickly Vidals into the townhouse. Rio immediately sprinted to the bathroom in the den while Nicky bolted upstairs for the bathroom up there. Honestly, it was better for them both to be in a place with three bathrooms as opposed to the loft where they had to share just one.</p><p>Agatha climbed the stairs, finding Nicky in the hall bathroom keeled over the toilet. She knelt down, collecting her daughter’s hair and rubbing her hand on her back. “Sorry about the Chinese, that lo mein cannot taste good right now.”</p><p>“I may never eat it again.” Nicky murmured before another wave hit.</p><p>Once her daughter was done, Agatha helped her up, guiding her to her bedroom. Nicky sunk into the bed, ripping off and curling into a ball. She kind of reminded Agatha of how she'd sleep when she was little, knees pulled up to her chest.</p><p>“You want me to put on Twilight?” She smiled, grabbing her daughter’s laptop.</p><p>“Of course, how else am I supposed to survive these conditions?”</p><p>The Twilight saga was Nicky’s comfort series whenever she got sick, having read the books long after they were popular. And if that’s because Agatha owned said books, well, that’s not important. She queued it up, setting the computer down on the bed. “I’ll go order some ginger ale and bring you a warm washcloth. I’ll try to find the flu meds.”</p><p>It was when she was almost across the threshold that she heard a small voice come from her daughter. “Mama, can you stay?”</p><p><i>Mama.</i></p><p>Agatha froze, she hadn’t gotten a ‘mama’ in <i>years</i>. She couldn’t even recall the last time Nicky called her that, definitely before the divorce. Part of it was that Nicky was growing up, another part being her daughter no longer wanting to call her something sappier than ‘mom’. She turned on her heel and kicked off her shoes, her heart kind of warm and fuzzy. She cautiously got into bed next to her daughter, assuming that she’d just sit there beside her. Surprisingly, Nicky rolled over, situating herself so that her head rested on Agatha’s chest and her arm was slung around her stomach.</p><p><i>Clinging to her</i>.</p><p><i>As a source of comfort</i>.</p><p>Was it because she was sick? Yeah, probably.</p><p>But Agatha was going to take the touch anyway.</p><p>She had her baby on her chest, seeking out affection from <i>her</i>.</p><p>Agatha grabbed the computer, placing it on her lap and pressing play. She had to act casual about this, if she made it a big deal, Nicky might take it back. Her daughter was like an aloof cat, Agatha couldn’t say she wanted the touch, she had to be cool. Agatha placed a kiss to the crown of her daughter’s head, resting her cheek there as the movie began.</p><p>A few minutes later Rio stumbled in, wrapped in a throw blanket from the couch, shivering. She looked at the two of them, a smile forming. “I’m gonna crash on the couch, I think any nutrients have left my body.”</p><p>Their daughter glanced up from the screen. “No, mami, c’mon. We’re watching Twilight.”</p><p>Rio’s brows furrowed. “The vampire movie?”</p><p>“The whole saga.” Agatha corrected.</p><p>Her ex wife shuffled over, flopping down on the other side of Nicky, curling against her. “Aren’t these Mormon propaganda?”</p><p>“Not if you watch it ironically.” Their daughter yawned.</p><p>So, that’s how they spent the rest of the morning into the afternoon. Agatha didn't think the three of them would ever do something like this again, waste a day with one another. But having her ex wife there wasn't terrible. As they moved on from movie to movie, the little jokes and comments became more and more common.</p><p>“Why does the blond one look like that?” Rio asked during New Moon.</p><p>“Who? Jasper?” Agatha peered over.</p><p>“Yeah. That guy.”</p><p>“Unsolved mystery.” Their daughter answered. “Dude looks constipated.”</p><p>The day morphed, Nicky’s bed becoming an island of tissues and meds, both her ex and daughter drifting in and out of sleep. After Eclipse, they all changed into pjs, Agatha loaning Rio some sweatpants and a Red Sox hoodie that Agatha still wore often even though it technically belonged to her ex.</p><p>It was about half way through Breaking Dawn when both Rio and Nicky had passed out, her daughter drooling on her chest the same way Rio was currently drooling on a pillow. The sun had set already and Agatha was eerily calm, letting herself close her eyes and doze off as before Bella gave birth. She was actually tired, but she also didn’t need to watch the labor and delivery scene.</p><p>Her eyes only opened at a loud noise from the laptop, she had turned over in her sleep, an arm slung over her waist. She roused, blinking a few times and peeking down at what she assumed was her daughter’s limb. Her face fell as she recognized the hand that was limp against her abdomen, as she recognized <i>that ring</i>.</p><p>She flipped over, too quickly, causing Rio next to her to wake up. Amber eyes came into focus, her ex wife pulling her arm back as though it would be sliced off for touching Agatha.</p><p>“Shit.” Rio whispered.</p><p>Agatha looked around but didn’t get up. “Where’s Nicky?”</p><p>Her ex paused the movie and slumped back against the pillow. “No clue.”</p><p>She should get up, she should put distance between them because right now they were mere inches apart. “I never ordered ginger ale.”</p><p>“Probably for the better, that shit is awful.”</p><p>Agatha grinned, looking over Rio’s shoulder at the clock. “I should probably make dinner. You know, soup or something…”</p><p>And Rio’s lips curled up. “Okay.”</p><p>Yet, Agatha still didn’t move.</p><p>They weren’t touching.</p><p>They weren’t doing anything but talking.</p><p>Nothing untoward was happening.</p><p>She scooted in, just fractionally, just to get comfortable.</p><p>Rio mirrored her and moved in too, their knees brushing one another.</p><p>“Did,” Rio swallowed. “Did you want me to head out?”</p><p>Her gaze naturally followed the slope of her ex wife’s nose, down to her cupid’s bow, stopping at her lips. Rio was sick, her breath could not be appealing now more than ever, but the day had been so good and nostalgia is an effective drug.</p><p>“No.” She responded, tilting her face and letting the tip of her nose graze Rio’s.</p><p>“I thought you wanted to stop.”</p><p>“We’re not doing anything.”</p><p>“This feels like <i>something</i>.”</p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s hand fall back to her waist, just resting, not gripping. “So, we should find Nicky?” She offered as a way out for the both of them.</p><p>“If you think we should.”</p><p>They should, they definitely should.</p><p>“I-”</p><p>Agatha was cut off by a knock on the front door downstairs, pulling away like she was escaping a fugue state. She scrambled off <i>their daughter’s</i> bed for fucks sake, bolting away and down to the first floor. She ignored the phantom sensation of Rio’s fingers as she opened the door, a cold blast of December air hitting her body. Just as effective as ice water being dumped over her frayed nerves.</p><p>Her eyes landed on Wanda on her front step, holding up a case of ginger ale. “Figured you could use this.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Wh- Wanda, what?”</p><p>Her girlfriend brushed past her. “I got your text that Nicky was sick, so after work I stopped at the store.”</p><p>Yeah, Agatha had texted her <i>this morning</i>, having abandoned her phone after all three of them got back home. “That’s- that’s really sweet of you. You didn’t have to do that.”</p><p>“I wanted to.” Wanda smiled. “Plus, I need the brownie points.”</p><p>Her daughter turned a corner from the kitchen, a sleeve of Saltines in her hand as she was drowning in a Mass Gen hoodie. Her girlfriend looked at Nicky, giving a wave. “Hey Nic, feeling any better?”</p><p>Her daughter squinted her eyes, stopping mid chew to scowl before audibly <i>hissing</i> at the woman in their foyer.</p><p>“What the fuck?” Wanda murmured as Nicky kept on walking.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “It’s been a day.”</p><p>“Yeah–”</p><p>“Wanda?” Rio spoke, languidly coming down the stairs, wrapped up in that throw blanket again.</p><p>Her girlfriend looked at her ex wife then back to Agatha. “Rio’s here?”</p><p>“Well, Nicky got her sick and then she couldn’t drive herself home from the hospital, so I gave her a ride…” Agatha rambled. “It just made sense for them to be sick in the same place.”</p><p>Wanda cocked her head. “<i>Right</i>.”</p><p>“Believe me, I’ve been surrounded by vomit all day.” She quipped. “Hardly something I planned.”</p><p>Her girlfriend nodded, though clearly unconvinced. She held out the ginger ale. “Well, I’ll leave you guys to it.”</p><p>“Wanda–”</p><p>“It’s fine.” Wanda dismissed, leaving and closing the door behind her.</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha set down the soda, grabbing a coat and her snow boots to follow. She didn’t miss the way her ex watched as she did so. She slammed the door behind her, doing a half jog to catch up to her girlfriend down the walkway. “Wanda.”</p><p>“I said it’s fine.” Wanda repeated as she stopped. “I just would’ve appreciated the heads up.”</p><p>“Hon, it was a last minute thing. I didn’t invite her, Nicky did.”</p><p>She chose not to point out that she also hadn’t invited Wanda either, probably wouldn’t help the situation.</p><p>“Agatha.” Her girlfriend blew out a breath. “Do you understand how I feel? I know how your daughter sees me, I know how your ex sees me. And I’ve been patient, I’ve brushed it off. But I need you to be honest with me.”</p><p>“I have been.” She lied, her breath visible beneath the street lamps.</p><p>“I see that way Rio looks at you.” Wanda bitterly chuckled. “Am I wasting my time here? Because…I thought we were really going somewhere. It’s been almost a year, I’m serious about you.”</p><p>“What? No. Wanda,” She took a step forward, curling her fingers around the hem of Wanda’s jacket. “I’m with you. My ex wife is…she’s always going to be in my life but I’m <i>with</i> you.”</p><p>“So you can honestly say that you don’t feel anything for her?” Wanda tilted her head.</p><p>And Agatha had to be smart here, because today was a glitch.</p><p><i>Today</i>, Nicky liked her. And <i>today</i> was nice. But tomorrow? Tomorrow she’d go back to being the reason why Rio lived on a different street. Tomorrow she’d go back to being the reason Nicky had her life scattered between two homes. Tomorrow she’d go back to being the reason why they weren’t a family anymore.</p><p>But Wanda was the same as she was yesterday, today, and how she’d be tomorrow. And Agatha needed that, the consistency. It’s not that she didn’t like Wanda, she just needed to redirect her focus onto her and away from Rio.</p><p>“I can honestly say, <i>I don’t want her</i>.” Agatha lied again. “I want you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t <i>want</i> to want Rio.</p><p>Agatha <i>wanted</i> to want Wanda.</p><p>“You mean that?”</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>And she really hoped she would someday.</p><p>Her and Rio weren’t sustainable, not after everything. Agatha needed to get her shit together for the sake of her daughter and her relationship with Wanda. A clear boundary drawn with her ex. She needed Rio as a co-parent, not a back up whenever she felt like it. She needed Wanda as a partner, not someone to cry to when she felt sad.</p><p>Agatha leaned in. “I haven’t been fair to you, and I’ll be better about it. I should’ve told you Rio was here, but Wanda, I swear nothing happened.”</p><p>Which was true.</p><p>They hadn’t kissed.</p><p>There had been no adultery of any kind.</p><p>“Thank you.” Her girlfriend breathed out in relief. “I know I must sound insane-”</p><p>“It’s okay.” Agatha pulled her in, giving her a quick kiss.</p><p>Wanda wrapped her arms around Agatha’s shoulders, kissing her back. “Can I ask you something?”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“What the fuck was the hissing about?”</p>

<p><b>December 31st, 2024</b></p><p>Agatha sat in the booth, giggling over her second vodka soda because tequila made her take off her clothes. It was New Years Eve and Nicky was with Rio, meaning she and a few friends from work went out for drinks. There was Maria, the principal and technically her boss. Sharon, old as dust but a good time after a few drinks. She’d been teaching English since Agatha started nearly twenty years ago. Add finally Kate, a literal fetus. The twenty-five year old had joined the staff last year and Agatha took pity on her, mostly because she was the only other lesbian on the teaching staff, but also because she was easy to bully into buying drinks.</p><p>After the divorce, Rio had kept most of their shared friends, including Alice and Jen. Not that Agatha had spoken to Jen in years, not since Alex. But nevertheless it forced her to socialize with new people. So, she made friends with her boss because Maria was kind of a bitch and Agatha could appreciate that. And with Sharon, who Agatha leeched off of for school supplies.</p><p>“I’m serious!” Kate laughed, flailing out her hands, clutching a beer bottle. “She said she was only on Tinder to find a third for her and her boyfriend!”</p><p>“Fuck, that is so depressing.” Maria murmured. “Thank god I’m married.”</p><p>“Not all of us are so lucky.” Agatha raised her brows. “Give my love to Nat but also fuck you both.”</p><p>“Agatha, you could pull so easily on Tinder!” Kate shook her. “There’s so many younger lesbians who want a mean MILF!”</p><p>“Gah!” She gagged. “I do not need some frat dyke thinking she’s god gift to my vagina when she can’t even rent a fucking car.”</p><p>“Where’s Sharon?” Maria peered around the bar.</p><p>Agatha knocked back the rest of her cocktail and pointed. “She’s over by the jukebox waiting to play ‘I Will Always Love You’ for the twentieth time tonight.” She started sliding out of the booth. “Anyone want anything while I’m up?”</p><p>Maria perked up. “Uh, yeah-”</p><p>“Great.” She turned around, pushing through the crowd of bodies packed into the bar. She was not a fan of holidays like these, forced to endure another human’s sweat and body heat, but it beat celebrating home alone. Her ex had offered to do something, all three of them, but booze and Rio did not mix.</p><p>Their arrangement had grown more frequent since her last relationship ended a few months ago. Agatha knew herself, and as soon as Nicky went to bed, she’d fucking maul her ex wife. And Rio would let her, and they’d end up breathless and shaking in bed. And Rio would know all the right things to do, all the right things to say. And there’d be this voice in her head, one that would say <i>I’ve missed this, I’ve missed you</i>.</p><p>No.</p><p>Not again.</p><p>So, she shoved past people, reaching the bar. Agatha was trying to flag down the bartender when she noticed the woman on the stool next to her. A redhead no less. The stranger was drinking alone, mindlessly tracing her finger around the rim of her glass, mouth in a straight line. Sad girl without anyone on New Years? Easy pickins.</p><p>The ginger was more feminine than Agatha usually went for, but acceptable enough for a one night stand.</p><p>She leaned over the bar, pulling her shirt down just a fraction to show more cleavage. Agatha planted her elbows on the lacquered wood, waiting a beat before jutting her elbow out <i>just</i> enough that–</p><p>The woman jolted out of whatever stupor she was in, realizing she’d been bumped into. Agatha gasped, reaching her hand out on the woman’s arm. “Oh, hon. I’m so sorry, I think someone shoved me.”</p><p>No one had shoved her.</p><p>The woman waved it off. “It’s fine, don’t worry about it.”</p><p>“Let me buy you a drink to say sorry-”</p><p>“No, that’s too much-”</p><p>“Nonsense, I want to.” Agatha smiled, angling her body. “Plus, you’re alone, somebody’s gotta buy a pretty girl a cocktail.”</p><p>“Oh, they do?” Green eyes looked at her, a tiny grin forming.</p><p>“I don’t make the rules.” She sighed. “I usually don’t follow them either, but I’ll make an exception for you.”</p><p>“I don’t think I’d make the best company tonight, but I’m flattered.”</p><p>“Oh?” She raised a singular eyebrow. “Why’s that?”</p><p>“I’m commiserating."</p><p>“About what?”</p><p>The redhead shrugged. “Uh, my brother’s death mostly.”</p><p>And, god help her, Agatha fucking laughed.</p><p>Audibly.</p><p>She covered her mouth with her hand. “Sorry, sorry. That’s- I’m sorry to hear that.”</p><p>Okay, so she’s not getting laid tonight.</p><p>The woman blinked, and for some reason, laughed back. “Don’t be.”</p><p>“Is it his anniversary today?”</p><p>“Ten years tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha looked down for a second, inexplicably offering something of herself back. “I get it. My daughter’s is coming up next month, so…I just- I get it.”</p><p>“I’m sorry-”</p><p>“Don’t apologize. I always hated hearing it.”</p><p>“Right! Like it’ll bring them back.”</p><p>“<i>Exactly</i>.”</p><p>They remained next to one another for a minute, neither of them speaking. The woman then smiled, holding out her hand. “I’m Wanda.”</p><p>Agatha licked her bottom lip. “I don’t shake hands.”</p><p>“Oh,” Her acrylic nails disappeared. “Sor-”</p><p>“You need to stop saying sorry, sweetheart.”</p><p>Wanda tilted her head, a blush forming at the pet name. “Do I get your name?”</p><p>“Depends.”</p><p>“On?”</p><p>“You into women, Wanda?”</p><p>“You’re forward.”</p><p>“No, I’d just rather do more than shake your hand.”</p><p>The younger woman swallowed, maybe uncertain or taken off guard. “I am. Into women, that is.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled up, leaning in. “The name's Agatha,” Her hand dropped to Wanda’s knee, lightly teasing. “<i>Lovely</i> to finally meet you, dear.”</p><hr/><p>Rio stood in the bathroom, fixing her sweater, hoping it was bulky to swallow her whole. She tied her hair back and applied some concealer to the dark circles under her eyes. She was never one for makeup, but the wallowing and lack of sleep had caught up with her. Two weeks since the stomach flu debacle, since almost kissing her ex wife, and Rio was worse off.</p><p>Christmas had been fine, they were amicable for the day and Nicky’s sake. It also helped that Wanda wasn’t present. Therapy had continued, much to her dismay. There hadn’t been any big breakthroughs but Nicky hadn’t bolted out of any more sessions either. Rio bit her tongue most times, not wanting to fan the flames that had incinerated her family and marriage. It wasn’t worth the screaming. She could only defend the choices she made for so long before the fight turned futile.</p><p>Rio had spent last night, New Year’s Eve, at the loft with her daughter. It was Agatha’s night but her and Garfield had anniversary plans. Not that big of a deal, last week Nicky had to stay with Agatha for three nights despite it being Rio’s week. She had been pulling more overnight shifts, hence the lack of sleep.</p><p>Billy’s transplant rejected, which meant they needed to do another one. The only problem being how frail the boy was, his body growing sicker by the day. So, Rio stayed with him whenever she could. They played Connect4 or cards, she just couldn’t get him out of her brain. She didn’t know why, but he meant more than the average patient. She had been seeing for over five years, invested half a decade in him getting better. And it wouldn’t matter if it killed her, she’d fucking fix him.</p><p>It was New Year’s day, a Sunday, and since it was a holiday, they were free of family therapy for the now. However, Dr. Vostokoff still requested that they spend time together as a family. The hitch? Wanda would be at said family time, or well, dinner. Melina was adamant that Nicky needed to at least try and be civil, especially because Agatha swore that her marriage to Rio was <i>over</i>.</p><p>So-</p><p>Her six year old patient was deteriorating rapidly.</p><p>Her wife had chased after her girlfriend after they had almost kissed.</p><p>And now, Rio had to endure her wife’s girlfriend’s presence at family dinner.</p><p>She slammed the mirrored cabinet shut, her own reflection making her sick.</p><p>Rio didn’t recognize herself, not like this.</p><p>The concealer helped minimally, enough that she hoped Agatha wouldn’t comment about it.</p><p>She ran her hands along the knitted wool of her sweater, trying and miserably failing to get her shit together. Would everyone be able to tell Rio was having a mid-life crisis? Would her ex wife see her and stare in pity? Seeing Agatha was one thing, Rio could handle that. But add in that fucking Barbie? Kissing Agatha and calling her ‘babe’? Vile.</p><p>Well, that settled it, Rio’s getting drunk at this dinner.</p><p>She whipped out her phone, requesting an Uber ride when a knock came at the door. Rio closed the cabinet beneath the sink too, pulling her sweater one more time for good measure and grimacing at her reflection.</p><p>“Mami.” Her daughter said. “You’ve been in there forever, can we go?”</p><p>Rio opened the door. “Last time I checked, you don’t pay the water bill.”</p><p>“What were you doing in there?”</p><p>“Wallowing.” Rio deadpanned, her phone pinging. “Get your coat, our ride will be here in five.”</p><p>“Why are we getting a ride?”</p><p>“Because, mija,” Rio sighed. “I need alcohol to get through this dinner and I’m smart enough not to drink and drive.”</p><p>“That’s not fair, I don’t get to drink to endure <i>that</i> woman.”</p><p>She shrugged. “Should’ve been born sooner.”</p><p>Nicky’s brows furrowed. “You chose when I was born!”</p><p>Rio began to walk downstairs, grabbing her keys from the table in the hall. “Can’t hear you!”</p><p>Her and her daughter arrived at the townhouse twenty minutes later, letting themselves in. She heard the voices of Agatha and Wanda in the kitchen, but couldn’t make out what was being said. The place smelled good. Maybe Wanda was cooking? Oh fuck, Rio couldn’t like the food then.</p><p>“Hello?” Rio called out, taking off her jacket and shoes, their daughter doing the same.</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha groaned, her voice perking up on a dime. “Hi!”</p><p>Her wife appeared a minute later, sweater and jeans on her frame, hair wild and long, but–</p><p>“How was New Year's?” Agatha asked, motherfucking glasses perched on the tip of her nose.</p><p>Nicky shrugged. “Watched the ball drop, made mami a Tinder.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha tilted her head.</p><p>Last night, Nicky had stolen Rio’s phone to make the account. She didn’t really care, it’s not like she’d use it. Her daughter’s reasoning was that it’d make Agatha jealous and then her wife would want to get back together. And she didn’t have the heart to tell Nicky that Agatha clearly wanted nothing to do with her, so she let it happen. There had been one moment where Nicky almost clicked on the file in her photo gallery labeled <i>A</i>, which led Rio to smacking the phone out of Nicky’s hand.</p><p>She didn’t need to traumatize her daughter with half or fully naked photos of her mom…or their past sex tapes.</p><p>“The dating app.” Nicky explained. “I figured if I have to deal with la diabla on a regular basis, might as well give her a little competition.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze slid over to Rio. “You good?”</p><p>Oh, her mouth was wide open and there was drool pooling at the corners. Yet, of all the things she could’ve said, she went with “Glasses.”</p><p>Her wife self consciously pushed up the frames. “Oh yeah, got them a few days ago. All the letters on my computer look like squiggles now. I’m getting old.”</p><p>“I-” Rio cleared her throat. “I like them.”</p><p>“Thanks, I think Wanda hates them. Says between the glasses and my hair she can barely see my face.”</p><p>She’d strangle the bitch.</p><p>“No, I think they actually compliment your bone structure really well.” Rio said, trying to remain platonic about the thoughts swirling in her brain with those glasses.</p><p>“Well-”</p><p>“Rio!” Lilia’s voice boomed, the woman striding down the hall. “There’s my favorite daughter-in-law!”</p><p>Rio saw how Agatha visibly tensed at those words, her hands curled up in her sleeves.</p><p>“Hey, Lil-”</p><p>Her mother-in-law grabbed her arm. “Put your shoes back on and come with me.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Lilia leaned in, whispering low enough so no one else could hear. “I have weed.”</p><p>Rio grabbed her boots, looking between her wife and daughter. “We’ll be back.”</p><p>They stood on the back deck, right in the corner where they couldn’t be seen, passing the joint back and forth. It was cold as shit, but Rio didn’t turn down free weed, especially right now. Lilia passed the joint back to her, exhaling a hit.</p><p>“There’s something there.”</p><p>Rio perched it between her lips, curiously looking over. “Something where?”</p><p>“Wanda.” Lilia peeked over her shoulder, making sure the coast was clear. “There is something about her that just…<i>bugs</i> me. And you know me, I-”</p><p>“Have a sense about these things.” Rio blew out the smoke, immediately taking another hit. Lilia had a tendency to be slightly ‘woo-woo’ about things. Claiming when people had bad energy or not trusting their auras. “What’s wrong with her?” Other than the fact that she was the reason she couldn’t have her wife or family back, other than her being the one obstacle keeping Rio from being happy again.</p><p>“I can’t explain it.” Lilia took the joint back. “Don’t hog it!” She inhaled, speaking as she let it absorb into her lungs. “It’s just a feeling. I had one about you too.”</p><p>“You didn’t like me?”</p><p>“No, dear. You were a <i>good</i> feeling. Her?” Lilia shook her head. “I know my daughter, Wanda is not what she needs.”</p><p>“What does Agatha need?” Rio chirped, silently hoping for a specific answer.</p><p>“Right now?” Lilia cocked her head. “To <i>heal</i>. She hasn’t done that,” Her mother-in-law raked her gaze over Rio’s form. “Neither have you.”</p><p>“Kinda hard to heal when everything hurts.”</p><p>“Aw,” Lilia’s free hand cupped Rio’s face. “Bambina. You’re doing great despite it all.”</p><p>“Agatha hates me, I think.”</p><p>The older woman huffed out an incredulous laugh. “She still looks at you how she did the day she first brought you over. That ain’t hate.”</p><p>“Feels like it.”</p><p>Lilia took one last hit, passing the rest over. “That’s a gift for you, I’m going to make sure Agatha doesn’t need help. I love her but I’m scared of a kitchen fire.”</p><p>“Wait, Agatha’s cooking?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Lilia walked over to the sliding glass door. “Said it was a special occasion. Must want to make something nice for the girlfriend.”</p><p>Rio stuck the joint between her lips, inhaling as much as possible. Why the fuck does Wanda get a special dinner?</p><p>Once the joint was smoked down to the end, Rio flicked it off the side of the deck. Catching a glimpse of what <i>used</i> to be her garden. Now just a sad patch of dirt, sleet and snow melting atop of it.</p><p>How fitting.</p><p>She shuffled back inside, immediately sitting at the table. Rio sat in silence by herself for several minutes, her mouth becoming more dry, her anxiety simply floating away. Shit, Lilia had <i>good</i> weed.</p><p>Her stomach growled, everyone else funneling into the dining room. She kept her head low, not wanting to give away that she was absolutely <i>stoned</i>. For family dinner. On New Years day.</p><p>Nicky sat to the side of her and Lilia at the end of the table, there was an empty seat and then Wanda across from Rio. Meaning, once Agatha sat down at the head of the table, she’d be in between her ex wife and her girlfriend.</p><p>Rio giggled to herself about it, about the woman she loved being with someone else. At a certain point, she had to admit how comical her situation was. Wanda, a woman ten years younger than her. Wanda, the complete opposite of who Rio was as a person. Wanda, a fucking fem marketing exec who probably couldn’t make Agatha come for shit.</p><p>“Mami?” Nicky whispered. “You good?”</p><p>Rio wiped away a stray tear, her laughing came out harder now. “I’m- I’m great. Where’s dinner? I’m fucking starving.”</p><p>“Don’t get your hopes up too high, it is Agatha after all.” Wanda quipped, raising her brows.</p><p>Rio stopped laughing, tucking her tongue against her cheek. What the fuck was that supposed to mean?</p><p>“And before I forget,” Wanda stood, picking up a small giftbag from where it sat next to her purse on the entryway table. “Merry Christmas, Nic.” She extended her arm out, handing the bag to Nicky.</p><p>Her daughter’s face contorted in confusion, cautiously taking the gift. “...Thank you?”</p><p>“Hopefully you like it, I know all the girls your age go crazy for these.” Wanda brightly smiled.</p><p>Nicky pulled out the tissue paper, revealing the object at the bottom of the bag. Her daughter swallowed, her eyes widening in horror though her mouth tried to smile. “Wow.” She said in false joy, plucking the item out. “T- thanks.”</p><p>Rio stared at the demon baby in her daughter’s hand. “What the fuck it that?”</p><p>“It’s–” Nicky started.</p><p>“It’s a labubu.” Wanda finished. “It’s the next hottest thing, all the young people want them.”</p><p>Nicky looked pained to be holding the damn thing, but politely nodded. “It’s very…it’s <i>something</i>.”</p><p>“I’m so happy you like it! It’s so hard getting one of those.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Rio asked, because it was a fucking keychain, was it not?</p><p>Wanda chuckled. “It’s like $70 and there’s these drops and scarcity marketing–”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha walked in, serving plate in hand. She sat it down in the center of the table, the sides all scattered around it. “It’s a rosemary roast chicken, and if it sucks, don’t tell me.”</p><p>“You made roast chicken?” Lilia gawked.</p><p>“I did.” Agatha proudly told, pushing her glasses to sit atop her head. “Happy New Years.” She picked up the carving knife, leaning over to cut into it.</p><p>Rio watched and couldn’t fucking handle it, Wanda was just sitting and sipping her wine. Not even going to offer to help? Jesus fucking Christ. Rio stood, “Here, I can carve. You cooked.”</p><p>Agatha relinquished the knife and sat down, letting Rio cut the damn thing since Wanda wasn’t going to. It was just a courtesy to offer to help after your partner cooked a meal, was it not? Once everyone had some chicken on their plate, and passed around the sides, Rio took her seat again.</p><p>She tucked into her food, pretty fucking good considering it was Agatha’s first attempt. It might’ve been a little-</p><p>Wanda coughed lightly, reaching to sip her wine. “Chicken’s a little dry, babe.”</p><p>Agatha’s face fell, more than a comment like that should’ve caused. “Oh, sorry-”</p><p>“I think it’s delicious.” Nicky harshly stabbed a piece of chicken with her fork for emphasis. “Great job, mom.”</p><p>Then Agatha looked confused, the compliment bewildering her. “Thanks, teddy.”</p><p>Rio was more than happy to shovel a bite into her mouth, adding “Fucking scrumptious if you ask me.”</p><p>Her ex wife stared at her, like <i>really</i> stared at her. She whispered “Are you fucking high right now?”</p><p>She swallowed, whispering back “It’s fine, Nicky doesn’t know.”</p><p>“Yes, I do.” Nicky spoke, eating her meal without complaint.</p><p>“Don’t do drugs, mi vida.” Rio said, looking back to Wanda and bearing her teeth like a rabid dog ready to pounce. Serves her right for telling Rio’s wife the chicken was dry, it was Agatha’s first try, she should be supported.</p><p>Nicky giggled, mimicking Rio’s actions and bearing her own teeth.</p><p>Wanda sighed, clutching her wine glass tighter. “Yeah, that makes sense.”</p><p>Lilia at the end of the table was in her own world, just as stoned, yet unaware of the dynamics at play. So, innocently she asked “How was everyone’s New Year’s Eve?”</p><p>Wanda sat up straight, grinning. “As a matter of fact-”</p><p>“Fun.” Agatha interrupted. “Dinner, drinks. Fun.”</p><p>The ginger worked her jaw for a moment in obvious annoyance. “You wanna tell them what happened at dinner?”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip in frustration. “No, because we agreed to wait-”</p><p>“I proposed and Agatha said yes!” Wanda interjected, grabbing Agatha’s left hand and forcing it up for everyone at the table to see. “We went to my brother’s grave this morning to show him, and I thought we should show you guys too.”</p><p>Agatha snapped her arm back, hiding her hand in her lap. “I said to give me some time.”</p><p>“Well, what’s it matter if it’s now or a month from now?”</p><p>And Rio was feeling a lot of emotions at her wife agreeing to marry another woman. Heartbreak, sorrow, grief, fear, rage, pain-</p><p>“What the <i>fuck?!</i>” Nicky screamed, standing. “You’re marrying this fucking Teletubby?”</p><p>“Okay, slow down.” Agatha said, raising her hand. “Nothing is happening right away, I promise.”</p><p>Nicky picked up the carving knife from the serving plate, slamming it down into the demon baby’s body and stabbing the damn thing in defiance. The knife stuck up from where it was wedged into the wood of the table through the labubu.</p><p>“Fuck you!” Their daughter pointed at Wanda. “And fuck your gift! You don’t even know me well enough to give me shit. You’re just a stranger who’s the reason my family’s broken.”</p><p><i>Broken</i> was a strong word.</p><p>Rio reached out, gently tugging her daughter to sit back down. “Mija, take a beat.”</p><p>Nicky huffed, but slumped back into her chair, crossing her arms.</p><p>Agatha got up, clearly holding back tears. “I’m going to get wine.”</p><p>“There’s already a bottle-” Wanda said.</p><p>“I’m getting <i>more</i> wine.” Her wife snapped, stomping off and into the kitchen out of sight.</p><p>Rio threw her napkin down, speaking to Wanda before following after Agatha. “That was <i>really</i> shitty of you. Just so you know.”</p><p>Lilia was comforting Nicky so Rio left the room knowing her daughter was being cared for, she found Agatha bracing her hands against the counter, back turned to her. Rio walked in, clearing her throat.</p><p>“Wanda, I don’t want to talk right now.”</p><p>“Not Wanda.” Rio said, slowly approaching Agatha. She couldn’t really comfort her how she <i>wanted to</i>, her high brain telling her that letting her fingertips twirl the ends of Agatha’s hair was platonic enough.</p><p>Her wife’s head tipped back, a soft <i>moan</i> drifting out into open air.</p><p>Rio sucked her lower lip into her mouth, waiting as Agatha turned around.</p><p>“Let me see it.” Rio quietly demanded, holding eye contact.</p><p>Agatha held up a shaky hand, the ginormous diamond reflecting light. Rio grabbed her palm, bringing it closer. Oval stone with a silver band? This ring said <i>Wanda</i>, not <i>Agatha</i>. “Ugly fucking ring…”</p><p>Her wife didn’t say anything in return, taking her hand back and crossing her arms. “It probably cost a small fortune.”</p><p>“Are you <i>happy?</i>”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her, her head stayed down. “Yeah.”</p><p>Rio’s vision blurred, the tears forming without her knowledge or consent. Because somewhere in the deep recesses of her mind, Rio thought all of this was temporary. She had convinced herself that Agatha just needed time. That the divorce was some elaborate punishment. That, one day, Agatha would wake up and let Rio come home. She’d let Rio be her wife again. She’d let Rio be a family with her and Nicky again.</p><p>The tears fell as she realized just how much of a fool she really was.</p><p>How could one person be so fucking stupid?</p><p>Rio would wait forever.</p><p>And as she stayed rooted in place, her wife ran from her.</p><p>Her <i>ex</i> wife.</p><p>“Okay.” Rio’s voice broke, wrapping the pads of her fingers around the thin piece of metal on her own left hand. She pulled it free, her hand bare. Rio peered down at the gold band, a few scratches and knicks from the eighteen years of use. She grabbed Agatha’s palm again, dropping it there. “Then I concede."</p><p>“What?” Agatha’s eyes clouded, her own tears forming.</p><p>“You’ve made it clear you want me to stop pursuing you. You want something else, someone who couldn’t be further from me. So,” Rio’s throat went tight as she motioned to the ring. “Sell it, throw it out. I- I can’t do this. I’ve given it almost two decades and everything I have in me. I love you, and I can’t do this to myself. I can’t do it to our daughter. It’s over and I’ll have to be okay with that in time. I’ve got to let you go.”</p><p>“Rio, you’re stoned, I don’t want you doing something you’ll regret.”</p><p>“I won’t.” She sniffled, taking a step back. “I’ve never regretted anything about you, baby.” Rio turned around, wiping her face as she trudged through the home she had built herself. The one for her wife and daughter. The home that had their love cemented in every corner.</p><p>And she had to get the fuck out.</p><p>Rio pulled out her phone, storming back into the dining room. “Nicky, go say bye to mom, we’re going home.”</p><p>Their daughter nodded, slinking out and heading for the kitchen.</p><p>Rio ordered the car, tucking her phone away. “Lilia, good seeing you. Thanks for the joint.”</p><p>“Anytime, hon.” Lilia winked, trying to make light of what felt like a tragedy.</p><p>“Wanda,” Rio began, finding nothing nice to say. “Night.”</p><p>She collected her daughter, it was the official start of her week after all, and swiftly left that den of horrors. They waited together in the cold for a minute as the car pulled up.</p><p>“I can’t believe she’s marrying her.” Nicky sniffled.</p><p>Rio blinked back another wave of saltwater burning her eyes.</p><p>“Yeah. <i>Me either</i>.”</p>

<p>Agatha stood behind Nicky’s highchair, collecting the strands of her daughter’s hair. Her wife sat in front of their infant daughter, making Nicky giggle, keeping her distracted while Agatha tied a green elastic around half her locks. Their daughter reached out a chubby hand, a cheerio hanging on for dear life as it was smushed up against Rio’s lips.</p><p>Her wife happily took it, swiping her tongue out to collect it. “Thank you for sharing, mi vida!”</p><p><b>August, 2013.</b></p><p>Agatha smiled to herself as she combed up the other half of Nicky’s hair, it was thin but there was so much of it for an 11 month old. She quickly took a purple elastic and secured the other pigtail, not caring about the mismatching of colors because at least her daughter’s mane wouldn’t be in her face.</p><p>It was the morning, on a Sunday, and they were lazily going about their routine. Rio was dressed in some boxers and a tank top while Agatha had on some shorts and a big sleep shirt. School didn’t start up again for a couple more weeks and Rio had the day off, so they made plans to go to the park.</p><p>“Ma-mi.” Rio slowly spoke. “Princesa, puedes decir mami?”</p><p>Nicky made sounds and syllables, but had yet to say her first word. Rio was hellbent on it being ‘mami’ while Agatha just wanted to hear anything at all. Although, it would be fun to rub it in her wife’s face that she got a ‘mama’.</p><p>Their daughter belly laughed again, mumbling gibberish.</p><p>Rio slumped, a pout forming on her lips. “Por favor?”</p><p>No dice.</p><p>“She’ll talk when she’s ready.” Agatha snorted, rounding the chair and picking Nicky up. “And when she does, I’m hoping it’ll be something vulgar. Maybe fuck, or shit.”</p><p>Rio covered Nicky’s ears. “Baby…”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “I’m getting her and myself dressed, then the park?”</p><p>“I’ll clean up this-” Rio motioned to the cheerios Nicky had flung onto the floor. “Massacre.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her wife’s cheek, then looked at her daughter. “Let’s go, hon.”</p><p>“No teaching her naughty words!”</p><p>“Of course not!” Agatha smirked, walking away with Nicky bouncing in her arms. “Can you say puta for mama?”</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>An hour later they were dressed and sprawled out on a blanket in the park. Agatha had her hands clasped around her daughter’s as she took a few goofy steps, then fell. She’d smile and say “Good job!” before picking Nicky up again and starting the process all over. There were toys scattered about, Rio keeping her engaged without overstimulating her. Her wife was kind of a nerd about Nicky’s development, tracking every milestone. Agatha, on the other hand, was more relaxed. She knew that Nicky would walk or talk when she was <i>ready</i>.</p><p>It was around noon when the storm clouds started to roll in, her wife picking up any garbage and running it to the trash. Agatha waited near a bench, softly lulling her daughter to sleep, hoping she’d nap in the car. She was blissfully unaware of the <i>actual</i> storm making its way over.</p><p>Nicky’s cheek was pressed against her shoulder, eyes heavy, when a voice came from behind her.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p><i>That fucking voice</i>.</p><p>Her chest as well as the hold she had on her daughter tightened, her pulse spiking. Agatha’s body went static, not even realizing she was turning around until she was faced with her mother. Not her mom, her <i>mother</i>.</p><p>The warm wind picked up, humid as it whistled through the leaves of the trees. Any sunlight now clouded over, leaving her vision dull and gray.</p><p>“I didn’t realize you still lived in Boston.” Evanora smiled, but it was a false sense of security. Agatha knew that much, remembered that much.</p><p>She tried to find her voice but it eluded her, her hands beginning to shake out of instinct. Her lungs struggled for air, every inch of her light up. Agatha’s stomach dropped as she took in her mother. Her hair was long, stringy, and gray with age. Her skin withered from chain smoking, frame thin and frail.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened but no sound came out, her head seemingly pushed underwater so no one could hear her scream. Nicky was ignorant to Agatha’s tensing body language, thank god.</p><p>Evanora’s gaze shifted to Nicky-</p><p>No, no, no.</p><p>A hand reached out, intending to touch her daughter. “And who’s this?”</p><p>Agatha took a step back, her body might not defend its own self, but it had the instinct to protect her child. She swallowed, and still, couldn’t form a fucking word.</p><p>“Is she yours?”</p><p>Agatha could make out foot steps approaching behind her.</p><p>“Looks…<i>ethnic</i>.” Evanora’s face scrunched in disgust. “Is your husband ethnic?”</p><p>Rio must've heard because she was next to Agatha in a second. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Evanora didn’t seem deterred, still watching Agatha. “Where <i>is</i> this husband of yours?”</p><p>Rio, clearly pissed, took a step forward. “I’m her fucking husband, who the hell are you?”</p><p>Her mouth’s lips turned twisted into a cruel smirk. “That’s no way to speak to your mother-in-law.”</p><p>Her wife cocked her head, understanding washing over her features. “Last time I checked, my mother-in-law is a kooky Sicilian lady who makes a mean baked ziti and spends too much money on crystals.”</p><p>Evanora looked past, or rather, through Rio. “Do you need permission from this raging <i>bull dyke</i> to speak, or can you do that yourself?”</p><p>Rio curled her hands into fists at her side. “Hey! I’m about two seconds away from committing assault if you don’t get the <i>fuck</i> away from my wife and child.” She took another step forward, nearly crowding her mother. “And I’d get away with it too because the sheriff is close personal friend, took out his daughter’s tonsils last year. I’m an upstanding member of this community and you have a record. How do you think a judge will take you harassing the daughter you lost custody of?”</p><p>The sheriff was not a close personal friend and Rio loathed cops, but Evanora didn’t know that.</p><p>A rain droplet splattered to the ground below them, Evanora looking between the two of them. She didn’t look particularly intimidated, but said nothing else. Rio turned around, grabbing Agatha’s waist and leading her away. Her breathing was labored, her eyes brimming with tears. Why the fuck hadn’t she said anything? She’d dreamt of that moment, of facing her again. Telling her exactly what she thought of her and maybe inflicting a <i>fraction</i> of the pain Evanora had on her.</p><p><i>A broken wrist when she was seven</i>.</p><p>One that never healed right because Evanora refused to take her to the hospital.</p><p><i>Too many bruises to count</i>.</p><p>Ones that Agatha had to learn how to cover up from a young age.</p><p><i>A dislocated jaw when she was fourteen</i>.</p><p>The first injury of many that made Agatha scream so loudly, the neighbors called the cops.</p><p><i>Two cracked ribs as officers barged into the apartment</i>.</p><p>The way they ached as she begged her mother to stop.</p><p>Rio took Nicky, getting her into the carseat. She guided Agatha to the passenger side, buckling her in too since Agatha’s body was paralyzed with fear. Her wife started the car, a gentle hand on her knee.</p><p>“Cariño?” Rio asked, <i>so</i> fucking softly.</p><p>The downpour of the rain coincided perfectly with the tears finally overflowing. Sheets of rain ricochet off the windshield, Agatha dropping her face into her hands as the sobs ripped from her throat. Why the fuck hadn’t she said anything? Stood up for herself? Smacked the bitch?</p><p>Rio’s other hand carded through her hair. “Oh, mi amor…”</p><p>Agatha raised her head, sniffling. She forced the tears to subside, whipping around to check on Nicky, who was peacefully asleep in the carseat. “Is she okay?”</p><p>“Nicky’s fine, baby.” Rio soothed. “She’s good.”</p><p>“She- she didn’t touch her, right?” Agatha croaked, and she <i>swore</i> her wrist started aching from the storm.</p><p>“No.” Her wife tilted her head. “She’s safe. You kept her safe. Are <i>you</i> okay?”</p><p>She wiped her eyes out of humiliation, nothing had even happened, she was just being <i>fucking dramatic</i>. “Can we go home?”</p><p>“Yeah. Yeah, of course.” Rio’s hand left her hair, but one remained on her knee. Her wife shifted gears, backing out of the parking lot. “I think we’ve earned it.”</p><p>Once home, Rio got out first and opened an umbrella, holding Agatha’s door open for her. Her wife kept her dry as she grabbed Nicky’s carseat, scrambling into the house. Whether it had been the short jog from the driveway to the front door, or the thunder now cracking like a whip through the sky, something caused their daughter to stir.</p><p>She set down the carseat, undoing the numerous clips and scooping Nicky up as her daughter cried. ‘Yeah, me too, kid’ Agatha thought as she pressed a kiss to Nicky’s forehead. Her daughter wailed, tiny hands clinging to her shirt and hair. “It’s okay, sweetheart. You’re okay.”</p><p>Her daughter gulped down some air in between another sob, a hiccupping “<i>Mama</i>.” said in a small voice. Rio froze next to her as Agatha’s eyes went wide.</p><p>“Did she just-” Her wife started.</p><p>“She said mama.” She smiled, genuinely. Her daughter, presumably scared, had said her first word in reference to Agatha. She couldn’t remember a time growing up and asking for her mother when she was scared, mostly because it was Evanora she was terrified of. “She said mama!”</p><p>Rio chuckled, looking at their still crying infant. “Traitor.”</p><p>Nicky burrowed her head into Agatha’s neck, fingers tangled in her mama’s hair.</p><p>“At least it wasn’t fuck.” Agatha grinned.</p><p>“A miracle.” Rio said, placing her hand on the small of Agatha’s back. “Seriously, are you okay?”</p><p>No, but she was safe. “Better now that I’m the favorite.”</p><p>“‘Uh’ sounds are much easier for babies than ‘ee’ sounds, plus it’s a repetitive word!”</p><p>“Don’t be a sore loser, baby.”</p><p>“Do you wanna talk about it?” Rio offered, gigantic eyes filled with sympathy.</p><p>“Later.” Agatha held Nicky as close as possible. “I just want to enjoy this.”</p><p>Her wife nodded, letting the subject go temporarily. “Okay.”</p><p>Their daughter’s cries quieted, now small whimpers. “Mama.”</p><p>Agatha’s face lit up as she pressed her cheek atop Nicky’s head. “You tell ‘em, hon.”</p><p>“Now it just feels like she’s rubbing it in.”</p><p>“She has her mama’s wit!”</p><hr/><p><i>Are you happy?</i></p><p>Her ex wife’s voice rang in her head, rattling and echoing. Agatha threw another dish into the sink, hearing the shattering of the bowl and not really giving a fuck.</p><p><i>Are you happy?</i></p><p>Who's truly happy nowadays anyways? The Amish? She scraped the rest of the <i>dry</i> chicken into the garbage can, hurling the very nice serving plate into the sink. Another sound of ceramic being broken.</p><p><i>Are you happy?</i></p><p>And then Rio and Nicky left, her daughter barely giving her the courtesy of an actual glance. “Don’t marry her.” was the sage advice her thirteen year old gave her, doe eyes reddened to match Agatha’s own. Notably, <i>no</i> hug. Not that she particularly blamed her daughter after the events of tonight's dinner.</p><p><i>Are you happy?</i></p><p>Who asks that?! She could fucking <i>feel</i> Rio’s wedding ring burning a hole in the pocket of her jeans. What the fuck did she expect Agatha to do with it? Why was that now her responsibility?</p><p><i>Are you happy?</i><br/>
<i>Are you happy?</i><br/>
<i>Are you happy?</i></p><p>She flung the silverware into the metal basin, a horrible clanging sound reverberating throughout the kitchen. Agatha found her wine glass on the counter top, chugging it in one go and wincing at the taste of fucking <i>chugging</i> merlot.</p><p><i>Are you happy?</i></p><p>“Can I help?” Wanda chirped from the threshold of the hallway, a tight and unconvincing smile on her face.</p><p>“I think you’ve done enough.” Agatha scoffed, crossing the room to the fridge and grabbing another bottle.</p><p>Wanda walked in, setting her hands on the counter. “How was I supposed to know Nicky would lash out like that?”</p><p>Agatha ripped the cork out of the bottle with her teeth, spitting it out. “Her birthday dinner? Therapy? The fact that I asked you for some fucking time? I don’t know, it feels like there were context clues, <i>hon</i>.”</p><p>Her girlfriend rolled her eyes. “It’s adolescent rage, it's a phase! And you’re the one who lets her thirteen year old bully and manipulate everyone else around her.”</p><p>“Manipulate?!” Agatha cocked her head. “She’s not being mean for shits and giggles, Wanda! She feels like nobody is listening to her, that her feelings don’t matter. That’s why I wanted to fucking wait, which I explicitly told you last night! You don’t get to talk about <i>my</i> daughter like that when you just folded her world in on itself.”</p><p>Public proposals should be outlawed, all those people staring as Wanda got down on one knee in the middle of the restaurant. Agatha hadn’t even said <i>yes</i>, she just nodded and smiled and then before she knew it, the fucking ring was on her finger. She specifically told Wanda when they got back home that she needed time to <i>actually</i> accept.</p><p>Agatha knew why Wanda proposed when she did, two fucking weeks after she thought something happened between her and Rio. Insecurity breeds competition. And yeah, Agatha didn’t consider herself <i>ready</i> for marriage, but at least someone fucking wanted her. That was a miracle in its own right. At least Wanda showed up and actually did things to prove she <i>wanted</i> Agatha.</p><p><i>I love you, and I can’t do this to myself.</i></p><p>Then fight for me.</p><p>Rio didn’t do anything but leave, had done the same after Alex. Saying ‘I love you’ wasn’t enough, it didn’t guarantee anything. And then, in the most predictable and ironic turn of events, Rio left again tonight.</p><p><i>Then I concede.</i></p><p>Fight for me.</p><p><i>I can’t do it to our daughter.</i></p><p>Fight. For. Me.</p><p><i>Then I concede.</i></p><p>As if she hadn’t given up long before that.</p><p>Always the victim.</p><p>Always the poor puppy Agatha had kicked to the curb.</p><p>Rio conceded the day Alex was born, she had given up the second things got tough. She stopped fighting for Agatha that day, happy to withdraw completely. She left Agatha to grieve <i>alone</i>. To mourn <i>alone</i>. Rio checked out and didn’t check back in until Agatha had served her the fucking papers, and by that time it was too late.</p><p>“You jumped the fucking gun to stake your claim on me!” Agatha shouted, wildly gesturing.</p><p>“That’s ridiculous!”</p><p>“Is it? You’re jealous of Rio, you’re convinced something happened between us-”</p><p>“She still wears her fucking wedding ring, Agatha! <i>She’s</i> Nicky’s mom! How the hell am I supposed to compete with that?!”</p><p>“I’m not asking you to!” She dug in her jeans for the ring, holding it up. “And she doesn’t!”</p><p>“Maybe that’s the problem! You don’t seem to care about how your ex or daughter treat me. You’re ashamed of the engagement-”</p><p>“You can’t be in control of everything, Wanda!” Agatha snapped. “You’re acting shocked that Nicky isn’t connecting with you, when you don’t know her. She’d be your stepchild and can you even tell me her favorite color?!”</p><p>“Oh my god.” Wanda shook her head. “I can’t believe you’re not even trying to see things from my point of view.”</p><p>“I can’t quell your jealousy, validate Nicky’s dreams, and soothe Rio’s breakdown all in one night! It’s too much!” Agatha all but fucking screamed. “I’m just one person, and everyone fucking needs something from me! And somehow, no matter <i>what</i> I fucking do, I’m still the bad guy!” She slammed down Rio’s wedding ring onto the counter. “It’s <i>too</i> much! It’s too hard! I can’t do it!”</p><p>Her girlfriend blinked a few times, impassively raising her eyebrows. “You are being so <i>fucking dramatic</i>.” Wanda rolled her shoulders back in annoyance, looking unconvinced to be having this conversation. “I thought that there’d be at least one person happy for us tonight, I’m sorry.” Her tone came out mildly frustrated. “We’re not going to make any progress when you’re like this-”</p><p>“Like what?” Agatha sharply asked.</p><p>Wanda huffed, turning to leave. “Impossible and throwing a temper tantrum like a little kid!”</p><p>“I’m not throwing a temper tantrum, there’d be a lot more broken shit if I were!”</p><p>“I’ll call you tomorrow, hopefully you’ve calmed down by then.” Wanda quietly spoke, striding down the hall. Agatha placed her elbows on the counter, slumping over in frustration. The crashing sound of her wine glass falling onto the floor timed perfectly with Wanda slamming the front door closed.</p><p><i>Are you happy?</i></p><p>The sobs came out quick and short, her ribs wracking as the tears burned down her cheeks. She sniffled, pushing off the counter and surveying the damage done. The wine glass scattered across the hardwood, wine bleeding into the cracks. Agatha crouched down, not thinking twice about picking up the shards. She collected the bigger pieces and chucked those into the sink too, only then realizing the open cut on her palm.</p><p>Deep, almost black, crimson seeped out along her skin.</p><p>She hadn’t even felt the pain of being cut.</p><p>Maybe the emotional agony was much too consuming.</p><p><i>Are you happy?</i></p><p>“Fuck!” Agatha roared into the desolate room, no signs of life, not even in herself. Wanda was mad at her, Nicky hated her, Rio gave up on her. She wiped her runny nose with the back of her hand, grabbing a tea towel and wrapping it around her bloodied palm.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to eavesdrop-" Lilia began, spawning out of nowhere. “But it was kind of hard not to overhear.”</p><p>Agatha curled in on herself, hunching over the sink, weeping. “Sorry.”</p><p>Her mom came up behind her, a gentle hand on her shoulder. “You don’t need to apologize, not to me.”</p><p>Shit, it had just become second nature to say sorry.</p><p>She hastily turned, collapsing into Lilia's arms, because of course they were already stretched out for a hug. Agatha set her chin on her mom’s shoulder as she cried, her own arms wrapped around Lilia like a lifeline. “I think I’m fucking everything up, and I- I don’t know why.”</p><p>Lilia’s hand cradled the back of her head. “You’re not fucking up anything, Agatha. You’re doing your best.”</p><p>“My best <i>sucks</i>.”</p><p>The older woman chuckled, lightly pushing Agatha to look at her. “You need to be kinder to yourself,” Lilia grabbed Agatha’s face, thumb brushing away the tears. “And maybe analyze why it is you and your kinda-fiancée are screaming at each other in the kitchen.”</p><p>“Ma, please. Couples fight-”</p><p>“I don’t appreciate how she talks to you, and I know you wouldn’t tolerate that if you were actually doing well.” Her mom grinned. “You’ve punched people for worse.”</p><p>“That foster dad <i>did</i> grab my ass!”</p><p>“I know.” Lilia raised her brows. “My daughter doesn’t take shit from anyone, so why’s it happening now?”</p><p>Lilia had been the only one to believe her, when she was marked as a violent foster placement, a kid who was difficult and disobedient towards authority figures. She got to her house and Lilia had asked her why she punched the foster father at her last home, so she told her, thinking Lilia would be like any other adult and dismiss her. Lilia didn’t. She called and got that foster family’s license revoked and encouraged Agatha to make a formal report.</p><p>Her mom had been the first and, for a long time, the only person to see something more in Agatha. Something good, something that didn’t have to be beaten or punished out of her. Lilia always said that she saw Agatha’s file and her picture and told the caseworker that Agatha couldn’t be all bad, that there had to be more to that young girl.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Agatha’s voice came out weak, her lip trembling.</p><p>“Tesoro, the pain on the inside won’t go away until you do something about it. I’ve bitten my tongue and tried to support you where I can, but…you can’t outrun yourself forever. Eventually, you gotta face that you’ve been putting a bandaid on a bullet wound. I love you, but you worry the shit outta me.”</p><p>She nodded, taking a deep breath.</p><p>“Now,” Lilia’s hands dropped from her face. “I’m going to help you clean this up and then we’ll have another glass of wine because my buzz is kind of fading.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, swallowing the spit and snot back. “Okay.”</p><p>Monday night, Wanda called, apologizing for how she went about things at family dinner. Agatha accepted, more so out of convenience. She hung up the phone after talking for a while, throwing her phone onto her night stand. She slid off her engagement ring, examining it. Agatha hadn’t really done so in the forty-eight hours since being proposed to.</p><p>It wasn’t really her style, but it wasn’t fair to compare it to her first engagement ring. She had put her first engagement ring, along with hers and Rio’s wedding bands into her jewelry box atop her dresser. Agatha looked at the ring, oval and silver, weighted from the size of the stone. With her first ring, she couldn’t stop staring or smiling at it. Now though? She groaned, shoving the damn thing back on her finger and clicking out the bedside lamp.</p><p>The house was always so quiet without Nicky, so empty. Agatha never slept well on the nights where her daughter wasn’t down the hall. In fact, she hadn’t slept well in years. Almost six to be exact.</p><p>On Tuesday, she showed up for therapy. Not <i>family</i> therapy, the session with just her and Rio. She thought about bailing, but Lilia’s words had already taken root in her mind. Winter break wasn’t over for two more days, so she sat in the waiting room around noon, stomach churning at seeing Rio again. Nicky was spending the day with Lilia before piano, and she hadn’t heard from her daughter since Sunday. Agatha got the message, Nicky didn’t want to talk to her despite the texts and missed calls. She couldn’t force her daughter to speak to her, she’d do it when she was ready.</p><p>Agatha anxiously twirled her engagement ring around her finger, once then twice then thrice, over and over–</p><p>“You’ll blind someone with that thing.” Rio said, face sunken in as she sat next to Agatha, hands tucked in her jacket pockets.</p><p>“Sorry.” She murmured.</p><p>Damnit, knee jerk reaction.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“How’s Nicky?”</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue against her cheek, refusing eye contact. “About as good as you can imagine…given the circumstances.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>Melina’s door swung open, the doctor giving a curt smile and waving them in. Agatha rose first, taking off as if her legs could carry her away from here. She sat down on one end of the couch, Rio on the other. Melina sat in front of them, grabbing her glasses.</p><p>“How have you two been since the last session? Anything you would like to start off with today?”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Sweet, soul-crushing silence.</p><p>The absence of sound.</p><p>Dr. Vostokoff looked between the two. “If you’d prefer, I can ask about your childhoods-“</p><p>“Agatha’s engaged.” Rio interrupted, body language rigid. “Told us on Sunday. Nicky’s crushed.”</p><p>She didn’t correct Rio, what would the point even be?</p><p>“And what about you?” Melina questioned, her pen scribbling. “How do you feel?”</p><p>Rio bitterly smiled. “Fanfuckingtastic.”</p><p>“I understand you are being sardonic, however given you still wear your wedding band, I would like a real answer.”</p><p>Her ex wife pulled her hands out of her pockets, flashing them off to the therapist. “Took it off.”</p><p>Melina blinked in surprise. “That is a big step.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Eh, we still have our matching tattoos, so at least that’s <i>forever</i>.”</p><p>“Matching tattoos?”</p><p>“I have an <i>A</i>, <i>Agatha’s got an R</i>.”</p><p>“I don’t have a tattoo.” Agatha finally spoke.</p><p>“Yes, you do.” Rio looked at her. “On the side of your ribs.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes remained on the doctor. “No, I got it removed when we got divorced.”</p><p>“You did?” Rio’s voice clipped.</p><p>“Yup.” Agatha breathed out.</p><p>Rio couldn’t check and wouldn’t know if she was telling the truth or not, anytime they fucked after the divorce Agatha’s shirt remained on.</p><p>Melina cleared her throat. “Is the fiancée aware of you two having sex after the divorce?”</p><p>“No.” She answered. “And she’s jealous enough, Wanda doesn’t need to know.”</p><p>“Oh, Pennywise is insecure?” Rio mockingly pouted. “How healthy for a relationship and new marriage.”</p><p>“When was the last time you two had intercourse?” The doctor asked, unbothered.</p><p>“Uh, almost a year ago, last February.” Agatha said, ignoring Rio’s side-eye.</p><p>“And what triggered it?”</p><p>Nobody spoke, then her ex opened her mouth. “I think that’s a question for Agatha since she’s always the one to initiate.”</p><p>“God, are you on the rag or something?” Agatha snapped. “Why the fuck are you on my dick right now?”</p><p>Rio grinned, hands motioning to her but looking at the doctor. “I’ll be surprised if get an answer out of her because I haven’t been fucking able to in years!”</p><p>“Alex’s anniversary was a few days after, you prick.” Agatha sneered. “And you never come to her grave, and you never wanna spend time with me or Nicky on that day, so fucking you was the only way I could feel somewhat close to our dead child!”</p><p>Now that, that was all <i>painfully</i> true.</p><p>Rio slumped back against the couch, mouth closing. Agatha waited, hoped, prayed for a response—</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Melina wrote some more down. “And the other times? Were those also Alex related?”</p><p>“I don’t fucking know.” Agatha said, resting her head against her hand. “Felt lonely, wanted an orgasm. Why else do people fuck?”</p><p>“Rio,” Melina started. “Why is it that you go quiet when Alex is mentioned? Do you harbor guilt?”</p><p>“I just prefer not to.” Rio spoke, adding nothing else.</p><p>Melina sighed. “Fine, is the sex the same as it was during your marriage?”</p><p>“Excuse me?” Agatha cocked her head. “Perv.”</p><p>“Agatha doesn’t want me touching her stomach, she stays covered up.” Her ex wife willingly told.</p><p>“Fuck you.” Agatha muttered.</p><p>“What’s the purpose for staying covered?” The doctor scrunched her face.</p><p>“I- I have a scar…from Alex. I don’t want it touched.”</p><p>“Does your current partner respect that? Staying covered?”</p><p>“Oh, no.” Agatha smiled, making sure the information stung. “Wanda gets to see and touch it all she wants.” Her eyes flew to Rio. “She’s not the reason it’s there.”</p><p>“And Rio is?”</p><p>“Rio’s not the reason I had a C-section. She’s the reason Alex didn’t <i>survive</i> the C-section.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m also the reason <i>you</i> survived that C-section.” Her ex mumbled under her breath.</p><p>“Elaborate for me.” The therapist’s eyes bounced from her, to Rio, and back. “<i>What happened to Alex?</i>”</p>

<p><b>February, 2020.</b></p><p>“Rio, wake up.” Agatha shifted in bed, her thighs feeling sticky and warm. “I- I’m bleeding.”</p><p>Her wife shot up in the blink of an eye, not surprising since Rio had been on edge this entire pregnancy. She even had the nerve to suggest Agatha terminate when they got the news that Alex wouldn’t survive outside the womb very long. It was actually a miracle that Alex had survived <i>inside</i> the womb this long. Most triploidy cases ended in miscarriage. It was still too early though, she wasn’t even thirty-four weeks yet.</p><p>Agatha’s body had been slowly deteriorating along with Alex’s. Preeclampsia that she had to take several thousand meds for, blurry or black spots in her vision, fainting. She couldn’t even go back to teaching after Christmas, couldn’t even chase Nicky around the house. Agatha endured it all, it wasn’t Alex’s fault. If Agatha’s body was the one to make her daughter sick, Agatha should be the one to suffer for it.</p><p>Her eyes wetted, the clock on the night stand reading <i>7:55AM</i>, a low groan exiting her lips. The sheets were definitely stained, her hands cradling her bump. “It’s too soon.”</p><p>Rio was already getting dressed, phone in hand. “I’ll call an ambulance-”</p><p>“Don’t, I don’t want to wake up Nicky. The sirens will only make her think something’s wrong.” Agatha writhed as more crimson pooled beneath her. “Call Jen, I’ll call ma so she can stay with teddy.”</p><p>“Baby, you’re bleeding-”</p><p>“I’m aware, just-” And right on fucking time, her gut twisted. Not like a contraction, she knew what those felt like, this was something else. “Just make the call. Help me to the car.”</p><p>Rio looked weary of the plan, but Agatha’s scheduled C-section wasn’t for another week, so it was the best they could do. Another seven days and she would’ve been at eight months, not ideal for any delivery, but at least Alex would get a few breaths in that way.</p><p>Twenty minutes later Lilia arrived and Rio helped her to the car, she sat on a fucking towel as what she only assumed was more blood and amniotic fluid gushed out of her. She softly banged her head against the window, the tears unabashedly flowing. Agatha had accepted the fact that Alex would die, it was the reality of what would happen. But, she’d die before giving up completely on her daughter. Nobody protected Agatha growing up, so she had to be the one to protect Alex.</p><p>Time, she just wanted <i>time</i>. To hold her daughter in her arms and be there as Alex’s body slowed to stop. To make sure she knew, albeit for even a minute, that she was loved. That she had people who wanted her in this world, even if she’d have to depart early. That her moms <i>wanted</i> her. <i>Fought</i> for her. That she was a physical manifestation of their love. Agatha wanted her daughter to know that, even if for just a fleeting moment. She wanted Alex to die at peace, with some respect.</p><p>And if that meant Agatha went with her, if Agatha’s body paid the price? Then fine. She was a burden beared for so long, and if this was the end, there’d be no better way to go than for the sake of her child.</p><p>She understood Rio didn’t agree, but it wasn’t Rio’s body or choice. Her wife tried over and over again to make Agatha see the light, pleading with her. She couldn’t, she couldn’t give up on Alex like so many people had given up on her. Their daughter’s full name, Alexandria, had been picked for that specific reason. Meaning strength or protection, an epithet of the goddess Hera. Agatha saw it fitting to name her daughter in accordance with the deity entrusted with protecting childbirth and family. A kernel of comfort she could send her child off with into the afterlife.</p><p>She was greeted with a wheelchair when they arrived at the hospital, rolled to a room, and left to wait for Jen. She’d been Agatha’s OB for Nicky, she had been the one to deliver the news about Alex. She had walked into the exam room during Agatha’s first trimester, doing another scan since the ultrasound tech left the room concerned and pale. Jen looked apologetic as she told her and Rio that Alex wouldn’t live, not long at least. That there’d be risks to their daughter. Early labor, congenital heart disease, seizures, underdeveloped organs, cystic kidney disease. That Alex wasn’t meant to live.</p><p>The next step offered was a medically necessary abortion, which Agatha refused. Not out of some moral or religious stance, but out of love. She made this body from scratch, and she would continue to do so for as long as she could. Rio watched, watched as Agatha got bigger, as her breaths grew short, as climbing the stairs became dangerous out of fear she’d lose her balance. Rio was worried about Agatha’s life, Agatha was worried about Alex’s.</p><p>Jen burst into the room, trying to smile. “How are we feeling?”</p><p>Agatha felt like the life was slowly being drained out of her, her lungs heavy and her heart palpitating. She was aware that her body wasn’t doing well, that the blood loss and numerous other issues were steadily becoming critical. “Great, I want to push.”</p><p>Her wife by her bedside, already frazzled, jumped up. “No, you’re not pushing.”</p><p>“Yes, I am. I’m here, I’m going to push.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said. “What Rio means is, you <i>can’t</i>. Not with your body already struggling to keep you and her alive. Your blood pressure alone has told us that much. If you deliver vaginally, it could be fatal to both you and her. We need to do a C-section, they’re prepping the O.R. right now.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, she thought the one bright spot in all of this would be not having to go through with a C-section. She <i>knew</i> what would happen. Her biggest fear. That she’d wake up with her child gone.</p><p>She looked over to Rio, her voice thick. “You have to <i>promise me</i> that if I wake up, Alex will be waiting for me.”</p><p>Her wife’s brows knitted together. “Mi amor, you’ll wake up-”</p><p>“Not at the cost of her.”</p><p>“Alice is on standby for whatever Alex will need.” Jen placated. “She’ll be in good hands.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t let her eyes leave Rio’s. “<i>Promise me</i>.”</p><p>“Baby,” Rio grabbed her hand, lacing their fingers together. “Jen’s going to get Alex out, Alice will get her to the NICU, you’ll wake up.”</p><p>“Not at the cost of her.” Agatha repeated. “I want her to go knowing one of us,  and if I’m not here, then it’s got to be you.”</p><p>“I won’t let anything happen to you, Agatha.” Rio’s eyes brimmed. “I’m not trading your life for hers.”</p><p>She whipped her head over to Jen. “If anything happens, save Alex.”</p><p>Jen’s face fell. “Agatha, when you’re under, your next of kin decides. And medically-”</p><p>“I don’t care!” She hissed, suddenly feeling sick. “You save her.” Agatha’s gaze swept back to Rio, tears making her vision blur. “Please.” She whispered. “Please, my love. Please let her live. You have to-”</p><p>“Nothing’s going to happen, cariño. You’ll be fine.” Rio gently told, unconvincingly she might add. “I promise, as soon as you wake up, we can see her, okay?”</p><p>“I-”</p><p>Another pair of scrubs informed Jen the O.R. was ready, a flurry of medical personnel gathering. “We gotta go.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand, placing a kiss on her forehead. “I’ll be in the gallery. I’ll be there the whole time. Nothing bad is going to happen.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, the salt of her tears beginning to stain her skin. “I’m…I’m scared.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I want more time.” She hiccupped, her fingers splayed on her swollen stomach. “I want more time.”</p><p>Rio smiled, though it was one devoid of joy. “If I could break all the rules of nature to give that to you, I would.” Her eyes flitted to Agatha’s monitor, obviously seeing something that worried her. “But they’ve got to go now, any longer and neither of you-” Rio cut herself off, clearing her throat. “They’ve got to go now.”</p><p>She gave a small nod, her bed starting to be rolled away after they gave her some drug to knock her out. Her hand slipped from Rio’s, her other still holding her bump. Agatha was given a cap for her hair, Jen making a little joke on the way about how the hell she’d fit all of it in there. She felt the drowsiness hit her as they approached the double doors of the operating room. In her last vestiges of consciousness, she looked down at her daughter inside her, whispering “Your mom loves you so.” in case she never got the chance.</p><p>Agatha woke up, her stomach smaller than it had been in months, feeling like a fucking semi had hit her. The sun coming through the blinds of her hospital room indicated it was probably sometime in the afternoon, how long had she been out? Her lids fought to close, scanning the surroundings. She saw Rio and Jen through the window, they stood in the hallway, speaking in hushed tones.</p><p>She was alive.</p><p>She was alive, meaning Alex was too.</p><p>A small smile graced her features, relief spreading through her body. Physically, she <i>ached</i>, a dull pain lingering. Emotionally, she beamed. She’d get to hold her daughter soon, or at least see her if Alex’s state was too fragile to be touched. She could get an estimate on how long they had with her, maybe long enough for Nicky to see her.</p><p>After a minute of waiting, she got impatient, swallowing through a very dry mouth and croaking out “Baby?”</p><p>Her wife looked at her through the window.</p><p>No.</p><p>The amber of Rio’s eyes had been reduced to a burnt crisp, no emotion other than sorrow stood out against the irritated red of tears. Her mouth was in a straight line, unable or unwilling to form anything but. Shoulders tensed, body rigid, almost as though she were scared.</p><p>No.</p><p>Her gut wretched, being torn in two as she read everything on Rio in a second.</p><p>Her wife walked in, Jen close behind.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, praying and hoping she was wrong. “Where is she?”</p><p>Rio’s voice broke. “Baby-”</p><p>“Where is she?” Agatha interrupted, holding back a sob. “Where is she?!”</p><p>“Alex-” Rio wiped her face of the wetness already trickling down. “Mi amor, Alex didn’t make it.”</p><p>“No.” Agatha uttered, throat tight. “No, no, no-”</p><p>“You were losing too much blood-”</p><p>“No! No, no, no!” Agatha openly wailed, her hands gripping at the scratchy blanket of her bed. “No! We had a deal! You fucking <i>let me down!</i>”</p><p>Rio rushed over, trying to offer comfort. “Agatha-”</p><p>“Don’t!” She yelled, sobs wracking through her. “Don’t <i>touch</i> me.”</p><p>“I- I’m sorry. I’m <i>so</i> sorry.”</p><p>She bawled, gasping for air when there felt like there wasn’t any. “<i>I know</i>.”</p><hr/><p>“That must’ve been hard, to go through that and know your child wasn’t meant to live long.” Melina said after Agatha had recounted every harrowing detail. “The guilt in outliving your daughter.”</p><p>Agatha sat in the exact same spot on the couch, in therapy, using her sleeve to dry her face. “Yeah.”</p><p>Rio sat in the exact same spot as well, silent and looking down at her hands.</p><p>“You alluded to the fact that it was your fault Alex was sick.” The doctor checked over her notes. “Why do you say that?”</p><p>“It’s true.” Agatha breathed out. “My one job was to keep Alex safe and I failed at it, I couldn’t heal her. I barely made it through my pregnancy with Nicky.” She bit her lip for a moment. “I- I should’ve been the one to go that day, Alex should’ve had time.”</p><p>“Triploidy is a chromosomal abnormality, it’s not something developed from the carrier of the child.”</p><p>“<i>Thank you.</i>” Rio murmured.</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth. “Oh, now you have something to add?”</p><p>“I’m just agreeing with Dr. Vostokoff-”</p><p>“No, you were undermining me.” She accused. “I know you think that I’m stupid for wanting to prioritize Alex, but did you even take her into account?!”</p><p>“Did you take me or Nicky into account?” Rio countered, voice quiet but lethal. “Did you take into account the people you were ready to leave behind? Did you consider Nicky growing up without her mom? Did you?”</p><p>“Oh!” Agatha theatrically gasped. “There you go again, pretending that Nicky is the only one who matters!”</p><p>“What the fuck does that-” Rio began to ask, when her phone buzzed. She pulled it out, reading a text and shoving it back in her pocket. “I have to, um, I gotta go.”</p><p>“Really?!” Agatha cocked her head, watching as Rio stood.</p><p>“It’s work, I’m sorry.” Rio answered, clearly frustrated. “There’s only ten minutes left of the session anyways.”</p><p>“It’s <i>always</i> work! It’s <i>always</i> your job!” Agatha shot off the couch, increasingly becoming more pissed. “That’s all you ever fucking do! Things get tough, you bail!”</p><p>“Are you <i>trying</i> to pick a fucking fight right now?”</p><p>“Yes! Oh my god, yes! I would <i>love</i> to fight! I would love to hear you scream or yell at me! Anything but sitting there like a wounded dove, fight with me! Fight for fucking something! Say something, speak up! Talk about our kid, say her fucking name!”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Agatha, that won’t get us anywhere. You’re the mother of my child, I’m not-”</p><p>“<i>Children!</i>” Agatha screeched, hands furiously gesturing. “The mother of your <i>children</i>! Am I crazy? Did we not have two?! Did I hallucinate everything I just told our doctor? You make me feel insane! Say something!” Agatha finally shot a hand out, nudging Rio’s shoulder. “Say something! Say you feel bad or sad or upset! Say. Her. Fucking. Name!”</p><p>She nudged Rio again, pestering, pushing. Her ex wife grabbed her wrist, the hold was tight but not uncomfortable. “Fine! You want a fucking fight?!” Rio’s eyes narrowed as she set her jaw. “I’ve thought about her everyday for almost six years. I dissect every choice I made that day, I think about what I could’ve done differently. It’s the first thing I remember when I wake up, it’s my last memory before I sleep. Every single fucking day for almost six years, that’s-” Rio thought for a beat. “That’s 2,190 days where I analyze the decisions I’ve made and find a way to live with them!”</p><p>She dropped Agatha’s wrist. “And the worst part is, I wouldn’t change a fucking thing. I wouldn’t go back and do anything differently. I’d choose you time and time again. And that guilt eats at me, it keeps me up at night.” Rio fixed her jacket, taking a step back and reaching for the doorknob. “That enough for you? You feel better now?” She opened the office door, “Now, if you’ll excuse me, a little boy that I <i>can</i> save needs my help. I have to go.” and slammed it shut.</p><p>Agatha sniffled, rolling her shoulders back and taking a seat again. “Notice how she didn’t say Alex’s name?”</p><p>Melina quirked a brow. “Yes, I have noticed a lot.”</p><hr/><p>Rio sprinted through the halls of Mass Gen, ignoring therapy with her ex wife thirty minutes prior. She wasn't even on-call today, but Jen had texted her out of nothing more than being a good friend. Alice was supposedly working on him as he crashed, which made no sense. Rio had been here yesterday, he was weak, sicker than he’d ever been, but no indications of him being on the brink.</p><p>She ran through the PEDs wing, still in her street clothes. She narrowly avoided colliding with patients and faculty, lungs burning as her feet pushed harder. Maybe if she got there, she could save him, do something. He couldn’t die, he wouldn’t. Rio had been seeing him for nearly six years, month after month, day after day.</p><p>Rio halted as she wheezed for air at the threshold of his door, people already filtering out.</p><p>Billy laid still on the bed.</p><p>Cold, unmoving.</p><p>No.</p><p>No, no, no.</p><p>She caught Alice’s arm, pulling her aside as Jeff held a wailing Rebecca. Rio furrowed her brows in confusion, Alice looked at her. “Pnuemonia. He must’ve caught a cold-”</p><p>“No.” Rio panted, unwilling to accept this. “No, I was here yesterday.”</p><p>“The chemo took too much out of him, his fever spiked too fast-”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Who was on-call this morning?”</p><p>Alice sighed, “Yelena. I sent her out of here when he took a turn, she couldn’t deal.”</p><p>“But-”</p><p>“Rio.” Alice was gentle in removing Rio’s hand from her arm. “He’s gone.” She left the room, leaving Rio to stare as two parents grieved their child.</p><p>She felt her legs begging to melt, to let her drop, but she resisted. Rio took a step forward, then another. She didn’t let herself look at BIlly, at the dead  six year-old curled up on the bed. Rebecca held the stuffed dinosaur, Jeff trying to console her.</p><p>Rio approached, her voice barely audible over the bloodrush in her ears. “Rebecca, I’m-”</p><p>She peered up, direct but not unkind in her words. “Do you have kids, Dr. Vidal?”</p><p>“I do.” Rio chirped, holding her own self by crossing her arms.</p><p>“Ever lost one?”</p><p>Her eyes welled. “I have.”</p><p>Rebecca slowly shook her head, weeping. “So you know your apologies don’t help anything.”</p><p>Rio didn’t say more, just gave a nod, intending to leave. “He was a good kid.”</p><p>“Wait.” Rebecca sniffled, holding out the dinosaur. “He’d want you to have Tommy.”</p><p>“No, Rebecca. I can’t take that-”</p><p>“You know what this reminds me of?” Rebecca stopped her. “My son, sick and-” Her voice shattered into a million tiny pieces. “Sick and dying. This dinosaur is his illness and not getting to be a kid with the little time he had. It’s him getting w- weaker. It’s him being cut open. It’- it’s- I hate this fucking dinosaur. So, if you can see something happy in it, <i>please</i> take it.”</p><p>Her hand, though shaking, took the plushie. “Okay.”</p><p>Rebecca didn’t say more, her head falling against her husband's chest once again. Rio stumbled out of the room, holding back a wave of unshed tears.</p><p><i>Bottle it up.</i><br/>
<i>Bottle it up.</i><br/>
<i>Bottle it up.</i></p><p>A cry bellowed through the hall, not Rebecca’s. Rio cautiously made her way farther down until she reached the on-call room, opening the door. She poked her head into the room, Yelena sat on the bed, shaking as she wept. Rio cleared her throat, the blond looking up and rapidly blinking to hide her tears.</p><p>“Dr.-”</p><p>“Don’t.” Rio said, clutching the dinosaur how Billy once had. “Grab your coat, we’re getting a drink.”</p><p>“It is two in the afternoon.”</p><p>“Yup,” Rio sadly grinned. “Sure is. Let’s go.”</p><p>And there Rio sat, at the same bar where she had met her wife eighteen years ago, drinking with her resident to drown every emotion in her body. Her phone had been silenced, the hours passing.</p><p>It was around seven at night, both of them several drinks deep, Yelena still looking like a sad puppy.</p><p>“I should have caught it sooner.” Yelena sulked, throwing back another shot. “I killed-”</p><p>“Don’t finish that sentence.” Rio lightly scolded, carefully peeling at the label of her beer. “It’ll eat you alive if you think like that.”</p><p>Yelena deflated in her stool. “How’d you know about this place?”</p><p>“Closest bar to Mass Gen.”</p><p>“Mmh.”</p><p>“It’s also where I met Agatha.”</p><p>“Is that the ex wife who you are still clearly in love with?”</p><p>“Who told you that?”</p><p>“Alice and Jen love to gossip.”</p><p>“Great.” Rio groaned. “And yes, that’s her.”</p><p>“Why’d you get divorced if you love her so much?”</p><p><i>I killed our daughter</i> was the first answer that came to mind, Rio picked at the label faster as she responded. “We, uh, we lost a kid.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m s-”</p><p>“Don’t.”</p><p>“Do you miss her?”</p><p>“All the time. Hurts like hell.” Riot turned her head, glancing at Yelena. “She just got <i>engaged</i>.”</p><p>“Okay so, maybe my problems <i>are</i> smaller.”</p><p>“Couldn’t save Billy, or my marriage, or <i>her</i>.” Rio listed off, fingernails ripping at the beer label. “Couldn’t fix anything, couldn’t be who she needed me to be, can’t even be honest with myself. I’m living every day lying to myself and other people because I’m too afraid of what would happen otherwise.” She chuckled, the damp paper collected atop the bar. “I’m so fucking scared that I just swallow everything down.”</p><p>The resident raised her eyebrows, whistling. “I think it is time we call it a night.”</p><p>“Sorry for putting all my shit on you, that wasn’t fair.”</p><p>“Eh, nothing about today was fair.” Yelena got up, pulling out her phone. “I am broke, so I assume the drinks were on you, yes?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>The blond smiled before becoming serious, genuine. “Thank you, for this.”</p><p>“No problem.”</p><p>After Yelena left, Rio finished her beer and had another. Not quite drunk, not <i>not</i> tipsy. She opened her phone to order a ride when-</p><p><b>Lilia, 5:44PM:</b> Just picked up Nicky from piano, dropping her at yours?</p><p><b>Lilia, 5:49PM:</b> Rio?</p><p><b>Princesa, 5:55PM:</b> mami,,,,text nonna back</p><p><b>Lilia, missed call, 5:56PM</b></p><p><b>Princesa, 5:58PM:</b> mAmI</p><p><b>Lilia, missed call, 6:19PM</b></p><p><b>Lilia, 6:22PM:</b> I’m going to drop her off at Agatha’s.

Ma said she couldn’t get a hold of you</p><p><b>Mi Amor💜, 6:41PM:</b> We have a child together, Rio.

Please let me know you’re okay.</p><p><b>Mi Amor💜, missed call, 7:03PM</b></p><p>About ten million more missed calls and texts, the time now reading a little past 8PM. Shit, that’s right, she had a child in her care at the moment. Rio rubbed her temple, her thoughts jumbling together in an especially pitiful cocktail of self-loathing. She ordered the Uber for Agatha’s, silent in the backseat.</p><p>Rio idly twirled the stuffed dinosaur’s ear around her finger, the seam she sewed shut pulling with each go around. She doubled down. Again and again. The thread breaking more and more. The ear going slack, looser and looser. Rio knew how the stuffy must feel, its thread being pulled taut, its insides falling out. Again and again.</p><p>Couldn’t save Billy.</p><p>Couldn’t save Alex.</p><p>Couldn’t save her marriage.</p><p>Her fingers wrapped around the ear, ripping it off.</p><p>Couldn’t save Billy.</p><p>Couldn’t save Alex.</p><p>Couldn’t save her marriage.</p><p>The stuffing tumbled out across her legs.</p><p>Can’t keep bottling shit up when someone yanks it out of you.</p><p>The car slowed and Rio got out, standing at the end of the walkway and letting her sight trail across the home. She had fucking built this place. Not the bricks but everything inside, and now, Wanda would live here? Maybe?</p><p>God, she should’ve drank more, that way she could wretch up that thought along with the contents of her stomach. Rio dangled the dino from her hand as she made her way to the door, knocking. She darted her tongue out as something hit her lips. Oh, saltwater. Tears. Amazing.</p><p>She knocked again after a minute, the sound of someone undoing the locks. Agatha opened the door, glasses atop her head, dressed in her robe. Fuck, she always looked so soft and pretty like that. Relaxed and bare faced. Rio exhaled and her ribs heaved, trying to get more oxygen as she seemingly sobbed on her ex wife’s door step.</p><p>“You better have a good explanation, I’ve been sitting in the hallway outside Nicky’s door in the hopes she’d talk-” Agatha said as she opened the door, before she got a good look at her. “Rio?”</p><p>Couldn’t save Billy.</p><p>Couldn’t save Alex.</p><p>Couldn’t save her marriage.</p><p>Rio looked up through her lashes, her voice small and inexplicably delicate. “Billy died today.”</p><p>Agatha’s aqua flew from her face, to the dino, then back up to her. Her ex’s wife's face crinkled in confusion, because she didn’t know who the fuck Billy was, but there was also a hint of something else.</p><p>Empathy.</p><p>“Rio?” She asked again, gentle.</p><p>“Billy, h- he died.” Her shoulders hunched forwards, the warmth of the house inviting, the chill of the January air biting.</p><p>Agatha blinked, her hands carefully coming up to cradle Rio’s face. “Okay.”</p><p>She lunged forwards, throwing her arms around Agatha. “Billy died.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand rested on the back of her head, her arm wrapped around her waist. Her ex wife’s voice and touch was a familiar and deeply missed comfort. “It’s okay. It’s okay, baby.”</p><p>She clung to Agatha, the tears lessening as her ex held her. “Agatha?”</p><p>Her ex wife pulled back fractionally to look at her. “Yeah?”</p><p>“<i>Alex</i> died.”</p><p>Her daughter’s name felt foreign on her tongue, having refused to say it for the better part of a decade. Rio couldn’t explain why, but she had seen it as disrespectful.</p><p>Agatha let out a nearly indiscernible gasp, so slight it was quick to miss. But Rio knew her ex all too well, and saw how Agatha’s eyes flicked to her lips for one millisecond before correcting herself. “Yeah.” Her voice wavered. “Yeah, <i>she did</i>.”</p><p>“Alex’s gone.” Rio peered down at Agatha’s lips, the ones she’d kiss too many times to count, before looking back up. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath fanned over her face as she responded. “I know.”</p><p>The booze, the grief, the day, it was all swirling together. Making her say the things she shouldn’t. “I’ve missed you.”</p><p>Another “I know.” was said, heavier and holding weight that Rio didn’t know still existed. Her hands softly tugged at Agatha’s waist, pulling them flush. Her ex didn’t shy away, didn’t tell her to stop.</p><p>“No, you don’t.” Rio uttered, her nose brushing Agatha’s as she leaned in. “You don’t.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled a breathy “No. I <i>know</i>.”</p><p>Her ex’s skin was hot, her mouth an inch away. “I can’t fucking stand it. I can’t-” Rio rasped, diving forward and letting her lips meet Agatha’s. Her ex shifted closer, the hand in Rio’s hair scrunching and keeping her planted. Rio dropped the stuffy, a light <i>thud</i> emitting into the room along with the sound of a quiet moan from Agatha.</p><p>Rio didn’t realize how badly she <i>ached</i> for this, how much she <i>craved</i> it. She angled her head, deepening the kiss as one hand dropped lower. Agatha writhed closer as Rio grabbed her ass, licking into her mouth. Her ex let her, she let Rio’s tongue move against hers, let Rio’s hands grope at her. It was too intoxicating.</p><p>Agatha’s taste and her scent and how deeply they were engrained into every part of Rio. Agatha was carved into every inch of her, a silent brand burned across her flesh, gnawing at her bones. An agony so sweet, the <i>lack</i> of pain felt painful. And she wouldn’t do anything different, couldn't. Not while standing in the home she built, her wife devouring everything Rio had left to give.</p><p>She kissed Agatha like it could very well be the last time, she wanted it to count if tomorrow her ex deemed it a mistake. What a shame, for something so perfect to be seen as wrong. There was nothing bad here, there was only love. Love that had been missed, love that had been discounted, love that had been ignored. Love that had been broken down, beaten black and blue, but still worked all the same.</p><p>And if she truly knew that, without a shred of doubt, why the hell didn’t she have it? Agatha’s free hand twisted in her jacket, finally <i>pushing</i>. Rio begrudgingly pulled back, her heart beating out of time. Her eyes fluttered open to see Agatha, her ex’s lips slightly swelled.</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha whispered, not out of remorse, but reverence.</p><p>“I’m…” She wasn’t sorry, and wouldn’t say it. But she was something, if only she could find the word. “I’m going to do better.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands left her, the sensation already missed. “I’ll um, I’ll keep Nicky tonight. You can take the couch. I don’t feel comfortable with you being alone right now.”</p><p>She’d much rather sleep in bed with Agatha, she longed for even simple things like that again, but she wouldn’t push for that with their daughter down the hall. The only other bedroom in the house was the nursery that had been left to gather dust for the past six years.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “I’ll grab you a pillow and some sheets.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Her ex cautiously left, going upstairs to the linen closet. Rio took off her shoes and jacket, placing them in the same spots as she did when she lived here. She closed and locked the front door. Agatha came back downstairs, handing off the blankets and pillow.</p><p>“Well, you know where everything is, so…” Agatha said, slightly awkward. “I’m going to go to bed.”</p><p>“It’s 9PM.”</p><p>“Bed.” Agatha repeated, making a move towards the stairs.</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Do you still have any of that chicken from Sunday?”</p><p>“No, I threw it out.”</p><p>Rio threw the linens down on the couch, shrugging. “Damn. I thought it was pretty good.”</p>

<p>“You wanna pick which flowers we give to mama?” Rio sneakily asked her daughter as they gardened together. Well, Rio gardened, Nicky toddled around in rainboots, overalls, and a bucket hat because Agatha was worried about her face getting burnt.</p><p>“Yeah!” Nicky squealed, her little legs carrying her around to different bushels of flowers.</p><p>Rio watched with a lazy grin as her three year old fisted her hand around stems and <i>yanked</i> them free. She chuckled to herself, crouching down with a pair of cutters and helping to sever the stems of the azaleas. “Good choice, princesa.”</p><p><b>May, 2016.</b></p><p>Nicky giggled, jumping up and down, braids jostling as she ran to a different plant. Rio diligently followed, repeating the same motions of cutting the stems so Nicky could hold the growing bouquet.</p><p>“Do you know why we give mama flowers?”</p><p>Her daughter pursed her lips in confusion, shaking her head. “No.”</p><p>“Because she’s pretty and deserves pretty flowers, right?” Rio answered, lightly poking Nicky’s stomach to make her daughter laugh again.</p><p>“Bonita!” Nicky said, her brain making the connection. She wasn’t as fluent as Rio would like, but was getting better each day.</p><p>“Buen trabajo, mi vida.” Rio gently took the flowers, walking over to the shed to grab some twine. “Crees que le gustaran?”</p><p>Nicky trailed after through the back yard. “Bonita mama!”</p><p>“Well…yes.” Rio considered, wrapping the string around the bundle and tying it off. She leaned down, handing them to her daughter. “You wanna give them to her?”</p><p>Nicky snatched the bouquet, taking off without actually answering. She followed her daughter as she climbed the stairs of the deck, hurling open the sliding glass door. Agatha was on the couch, laptop on her legs as she entered in grades. Her wife looked over at their daughter excitedly sprinting towards her. Agatha hastily moved her laptop to catch the child flying her way.</p><p>“What did I tell you guys about tracking mud in the hou-” Agatha began, their daughter breathlessly colliding with her. “<i>Mmhph</i>.”</p><p>“Mami and me got you flowers!” Nicky held up the bouquet like a prized possession. “They’re pretty like you!”</p><p>Agatha blinked before snorting, laughing and cautiously taking the bouquet. “Thank you, sweetheart.” She looked up to Rio. “Thank you, baby.”</p><p>Her wife studied the flowers, speaking to Nicky as she did so. “Do you know what kind of flowers these are, teddy?”</p><p>Nicky clueless shook her head, shrugging. “White.”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha chuckled. “But they’re azaleas.” She grabbed Nicky, placing her on her lap as she explained. “They can mean love or joy, beauty, even good luck.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Ah, the curiosity stage of raising a child. Where even the most mundane or straightforward things required elaboration. If Rio had a nickel for every time Nicky asked <i>Why?</i> in a day, she’d be rich…like Zuckerberg rich.</p><p>“Because sometimes, we have <i>so</i> much to say to someone, that showing is better than telling.” Agatha told, “Like when we hug or kiss you or each other, it shows how much we love you.”</p><p>“A lot.” Nicky threw up her hands, motioning them wide. “Soooooo much.”</p><p>That came from their goodnight routine, where Agatha would do the voices in the bedtime story and Rio would tuck her in, and they’d say they love her <i>soooooo much</i>.</p><p>“Exactly.” Agatha said, giving Nicky a quick squeeze. “Should we put these in a vase?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Agatha got up, keeping one arm around their daughter to situate her on her hip. “Let’s see if mama can keep these alive for more than a few days this time.”</p><p>“She won’t.” Rio murmured, raising her eyebrows knowingly.</p><p>“I can keep our daughter alive, can’t I?” Agatha shot back, walking into the kitchen.</p><p>Rio was about to respond when her phone rang, answering the call from her brother. “Vic, qué pasa?”</p><p>“Rio.” Her brother said, his tone already heavy. “I’m…good. Wedding planning and all that…”</p><p>She turned around, heading out onto the deck and closing the door behind her. “Who died?”</p><p>He nervously laughed. “Nobody. No one. Why’d you go there first?”</p><p>“Because you sound exactly like you did when you were twelve and threw that baseball, and shattered the kitchen window before blaming it on <i>me</i>.” Rio deadpanned. Her and her brother weren’t necessarily <i>close</i>, but they had a neutral relationship despite their parents opinions on Rio’s ‘lifestyle’.</p><p>“Papà would’ve believed it too if he didn’t think girls couldn’t throw that hard.”</p><p>“Yes, thank god for misogyny. Is there a reason you called?”</p><p>Victor sighed, guilt lacing his words. “Sofia and I finally set a date.”</p><p>“Okay…?” Rio spoke, confused as to why this required a call. “Usually people just send out those ‘Save the Date’ things.”</p><p>“I wanted you to hear it from me, I think I owe you that.”</p><p>“Owe me what?”</p><p>He was quiet for a moment, voice sullen. “Mamá and Papá said they won’t pay for the wedding if you’re invited.”</p><p>Rio momentarily pulled the phone from her ear, deciding her brother didn’t need to hear her trying not to cry. It wasn’t a shock, Rio and her parents hadn’t spoken for years, <i>especially</i> after she and Agatha got married. They didn’t see Rio’s parents on holidays, they had never met their granddaughter, and basically refused to acknowledge Rio’s existence.</p><p>There were a few things at play for Victor Sr. and Isabella. One, Rio’s sexuality. They were conservative and catholic, their ambitions for Rio stopped at her having 2.5 kids with an equally conservative and catholic man. Two, Rio’s gender presentation. Sure, she got away with being a tomboy as a kid, but once she went through puberty? Isabella spent a lot of time trying to fight Rio into being more feminine. She’d yell and cry, <i>”Mira, Rio! No man will want a woman who dresses like a boy!”</i>, until Rio agreed to whatever her mom wanted. Third, Agatha and Nicky. They didn’t particularly like that Agatha was a woman, or that Nicky wasn’t carried by Rio even if she did biologically come from her. She knew all of this, and spent most of her time trying <i>not</i> to know it. Rio didn’t regret any of the choices she had made in life, wouldn’t go back and do anything differently.</p><p>Rio choked all of that back, speaking again. “Victor, you’re <i>forty</i>, you can’t pay for a wedding on your own?”</p><p>“Sof has expensive tastes.”</p><p>“Maybe that’s because she’s twenty-eight!” Rio snapped.</p><p>“Listen, I just- I have to think about what’s best for the family. I want my kids to know their grandparents in the future. Nicola doesn’t-”</p><p>Nicola doesn’t have that, is what he stopped himself from saying.</p><p>Even at the cost of his relationship with her.</p><p>Rio scoffed, brushing away a stray tear. “Right.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Yeah, you should be.”</p><p>“We can always do a dinner, the four of us. You and Agatha, me and Sof.”</p><p>“No, I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“I don’t need to worry about you judging my family or marriage.”</p><p>“C’mon, Rio. You know <i>I</i> don’t think like mamá and papá, I’m fine with you being gay.”</p><p>“But it’s enough for you to discount me from your life.” She breathed out. “And it’s not enough for you to stand up to them.”</p><p>“That’s not fair.”</p><p>“Isn’t it?! You’ve never done anything wrong in their eyes. You’re the oldest, you’re Victor Junior. You’re the boy, the one that got all of the credit even when I out achieved you.”</p><p>“That’s just how they are.”</p><p>“Yup.” Rio tilted her head. “And you’re choosing to benefit from it.”</p><p>“Rio, please.” He whined, as if she were the one making things hard. “This doesn’t need to be a whole thing.”</p><p>“You’re right, it doesn’t. I’ll make it easier for you. Don’t worry about me or anything related to my family.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Victor said in relief. “I’ve got enough on my plate as is.”</p><p>“Great, so then this is over.”</p><p>“What’s over?”</p><p>“Our relationship. I’ve looked the other way about you spending holidays with them and pretending they haven’t disowned me, but I won’t do that any longer. Don’t worry about your sister,” Rio’s voice wavered. “You don’t have one anymore.”</p><p>“Ri-”</p><p>She jammed her thumb against the screen, shoving her phone back into her pocket. Rio opened the door just enough to shout “I’ll be in the garden!” and her wife to give an “Okay!” back. She put a lid on the fact that she had just cut off the last of her family, opting to instead focus on how her roses could be more spry.</p><p>Later that night, after doing Nicky’s bedtime routine, she laid in bed as her wife climbed in beside her. Agatha was discussing what Nicky’s ballet teacher chose as the spring recital.</p><p>“Which, call me crazy, but Nicky’s natural charm and intellect is wasted as a tree.” Agatha joked, looking over. “You’ve been quiet tonight.”</p><p>“I’m always quiet.”</p><p>“Yeah, but you’re <i>brooding</i>.”</p><p>“I am not.”</p><p>“You are.” Agatha rolled over on her side, fingers idly tracing Rio’s stomach. “Something happen?”</p><p>“Victor called.”</p><p>“Okay…”</p><p>“He…he’s not inviting me to the wedding because of our parents.” Rio repeated the information, really <i>hearing</i> it. “I- I cut him off.”</p><p>Agatha’s face fell. “Oh, baby-”</p><p>“It’s fine. Just sucks.”</p><p>“He’s a prick.” Her wife’s hand came to her face, cupping her cheek. “And, you’ve always got me and teddy. Forever.”</p><p>“I know, mi amor.”</p><p>“And we love you.” Agatha leaned down, kissing her. “Sooooo much.”</p><p>Rio smiled, deciding to focus on the family she <i>did</i> have rather than the one she left behind. She grabbed Agatha’s hips, rolling them over. “Yeah, how much?”</p><p>“I’m beginning to think you need me to <i>show</i> you.” Her wife innocently batted her eyelashes. “How <i>ever</i> will I do that?”</p><p>She pushed up Agatha’s sleep shirt, sliding down the bed to nip at the stretchmarks that now adorned her wife’s hip. Agatha had always been beautiful, but something about her postpartum body just <i>did</i> things to Rio. “I got a few ideas.”</p><p>Agatha lightly pulled at her chin, tipping Rio’s head up. “Hey, <i>really</i>, are you okay?”</p><p>“I will be in time.” Rio softly said. “I don’t wanna talk about it.”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha let go, relaxing against the pillow. Her wife never pushed her to talk about things when she wasn’t ready, Agatha also probably knew that Rio would warm up to the possibility of a real conversation after a few rounds. Sex, while <i>very</i> fun, was also a resource for them to be vulnerable with one another. Not to say they had to fuck in order to talk, but it did soften the both of them for deeper communication. “Well then, get to work, pretty boy.”</p><p>“Fuck.” She groaned, pawing at Agatha’s underwear. “Try to keep it down, Nicky definitely heard us last time and I had to tell her you fell off the bed and that’s why you were screaming.”</p><p>“In my defense, you <i>did</i> literally have my legs behind my head and I was coming and cramping at the same time.”</p><hr/><p>Rio was getting too fucking old to crash on couches, she realized as she woke up to the harsh light of day. After last night—</p><p>The night she had tipsily broken down about her dead child.</p><p>On the porch.</p><p>To her ex wife.</p><p>Before kissing her aforementioned ex wife.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Rio yawned, rubbing her hands over her face to try and wake up, head minimally pounding from a slight hangover. Her eyes focused on the coffee table, a glass of water and some Advil laying atop. She sat up, chugging the water and swallowing the meds, some noise coming from the kitchen. Could the sun tone it down for a second? Jesus, it was frying her brain.</p><p>There was some shuffling, her ex entering the living room with two mugs. Agatha didn’t look <i>happy</i>, but all things considered, she didn’t look completely enraged either. Agatha stopped in front of her, extending a mug. “Coffee.”</p><p>Rio cautiously took it, peering into the mug for a beat.</p><p>“It’s not poisoned.” Agatha huffed, sitting on the table in front of her, the fabric of her robe riding up just a fraction.</p><p>She didn’t allow herself to objectify the sliver of thigh, instead taking a sip. “Fuck, this is perfect. You remembered?”</p><p>“How you take your coffee?” Agatha quirked a brow. “I made it for you almost every morning for over a decade. Teaspoon of sugar, an obnoxious amount of half n’ half, cinnamon.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Least I could do before I kick you out.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I don’t want Nicky seeing you. She’ll think something happened.”</p><p>“Something <i>did</i> happen. A lot happened.”</p><p>“Yeah, and you were drunk and sad-”</p><p>“I meant it.” Rio set down the mug. “I meant everything.”</p><p>Agatha got up, waving her off. “Rio, I can’t-”</p><p>Rio followed after, pleading her case. “You kissed me back! You obviously felt something too.”</p><p>“Shock that you said Alex’s name for the first time since…I’m happy you made some progress. But,” Agatha raised her arms aimlessly, coffee swinging. “Nothing’s fixed, nothing’s different.”</p><p>“Things could be.”</p><p>“I cannot believe you are making me defend therapy right now, but nothing will change unless we keep doing that bullshit.” Her ex wife narrowed her gaze. “And are you trying to win me back? Did you think you could admit our child died and my legs would just magically part?”</p><p>No, but wouldn’t that make everything so much simpler.</p><p>“In a perfect world.”</p><p>“I won’t do that to Nicky. She’s frustrated enough as is, she needs consistency. Besides the fact that you’ve only just begun to <i>talk</i>, it’d be too hard on her.” And then, as an obvious afterthought. “And I have Wanda to think about.”</p><p>“Really? Wanda? Could’ve fooled me.”</p><p>“What the fuck does that mean?”</p><p>“Why the fuck are you with her? She treats you like shit, she doesn’t know Nicky, and she obviously can’t satisfy you!”</p><p>“She doesn’t treat me-”</p><p>“I’d <i>never</i> treat you like that. I never did. And I’ve held off smacking her out of respect for you!”</p><p>“You’ve moved on too. The one night stands and Tinder.”  Agatha tilted her head. “Sometimes it’s just nice to know someone will be there, <i>always</i>.”</p><p>Stupid fucking Tinder.</p><p>“So, you’ll marry a lukewarm body, but refuse to give me a chance?”</p><p>“Do you even want one?!” Her ex stormed into the kitchen, slamming the mug down. “You haven’t said so, you just <i>look</i> at me like that’ll fix everything! You stare and you wait because you’re so fucking chivalrous, but god fucking forbid you actually do something about it!”</p><p>“What do you want! You want me to get on my knees and beg?!” Rio shot back, genuinely trying to understand. “I tell you I love you and you get engaged. I come over and prove I’m starting to work on shit and you kick me out!”</p><p>“Fucking <i>do</i> something! You left after Alex, you were gone, you gave up!”</p><p>“You pushed me away! You didn’t want me, Agatha!”</p><p>“No, I wanted you to <i>fight for</i> me! You were too focused on pretending nothing had happened! Alex died and you couldn’t fucking deal! You shut down and <i>left</i> me in the cold!”</p><p>“How was I meant to fight, when in your eyes, I killed our kid?!”</p><p>“I <i>never</i> blamed you for killing Alex!” Agatha reared her head back. “I blame you for taking her time, for disregarding my wishes because of your own feelings.”</p><p>“Should I not feel?! Should I not have feelings about my wife staying alive?!”</p><p>“I told you what I wanted, you ignored it!”</p><p>“Do you honestly think that I made the decision <i>lightly</i>?” She asked, venomous in her tone. “Do you think it was easy for me? I knew exactly what would happen <i>as</i> it happened. I saw Alex, when Jen got her out. I saw your body hemorrhaging blood. I saw <i>all</i> of it.” Rio took a few steps forward, backing Agatha against the counter. Her hands came to rest on the counter on either side of her ex, bracketing her in. “And somewhere in the back of my mind, I was <i>sure</i> we’d move past it. I knew you’d resent me, maybe even hate me. But when you said <i>forever</i>, I thought you meant it.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were locked onto her own, overflowing with too many emotions to count. “At the time, I did too.”</p><p>“Are you going to keep punishing me? How long til’ we accept the inevitable?”</p><p>“Which is?”</p><p>“You don’t love <i>her</i>. Not like you love me, at least. And you never will.”</p><p>Agatha worked her jaw, swallowing <i>hard</i>. “That’s not true.”</p><p>“Then why’d you let me kiss you last night? Why’d you kiss me back? Why’d you call me last month just to get yourself off?” Rio lowly spoke, getting closer. “Why do you keep me coming back?”</p><p>Agatha seemed tempted for a moment, her breath hitching as she broke away, shoving past her and creating space. “Because you’re a good lay.” She pointed to the hall. “I’ll drop Nicky off later today. I’ll see you Sunday for therapy.”</p><p>Rio deflated, following the direction. She walked past Agatha, leaning in as she whispered, “The best you’ve ever had. The credit is important.”</p><p>“Oh my god, get out!”</p><p>She took her leave, shouting a quick “Heard that one before.” as she slipped on her jacket and shoes, shutting the front door behind her. Wait, damnit. Rio walked back in, rushing to the living room to grab her coffee and Billy’s dinosaur. “I’ll return the mug on Sunday.”</p><p>Agatha made a face of annoyance, but said nothing more.</p><p>“Te veo.”</p><p>As Rio stepped out into the crisp air of a winter morning, she strangely felt <i>lighter</i>. She didn’t feel cocky, per se. That’d be inappropriate considering her breakthrough was an inebriated tantrum about her dead daughter on the stoop of the love of her life, but she felt <i>freer</i>. As if she had taken the first step needed, long overdue, but a feat nonetheless.</p><p>She gingerly sipped her coffee, damn, Agatha always made it right. Maybe it was it being made <i>by</i> Agatha that made it so good. Rio ordered an Uber home, finishing her coffee by the time she got back to the loft. She showered the night off, brushing her teeth and trying to look presentable before Nicky came home. Before <i>Agatha</i> brought her home.</p><p>Rio saw the merit in her ex’s argument, because last night truly hadn’t solved anything. But for the first time in six years, there was that light at the end of the tunnel. She’d have to claw her way there, but she would do it if it meant they could reconcile. Really reconcile. It didn’t need to be sex, though that would be nice. It didn’t need to be Agatha bearing her scar, though that would be fucking heavenly. It didn’t need to be physical. She’d settle for an honest talk.</p><p>Holy shit, Rio went stiff in realization.</p><p>She <i>wanted</i> to talk.</p><p>Had the floodgates opened?</p><p>Did therapy and the death of her favorite patient finally shatter something within her?</p><p>Oh, that’s insensitive.</p><p>Agatha said Rio hadn’t fought for her–</p><p>Rio didn’t know that was fucking allowed.</p><p>Okay, fine.</p><p>She’d fucking fight.</p><hr/><p>“Do not fight for her.” Melina said, annoyed.</p><p>To her credit, she was probably bothered that Rio had shown up early for therapy on Sunday. Nicky was still in the waiting room and Rio had <i>barged in</i> needing to tell <i>someone</i> about kissing Agatha. The doctor, dumbfounded by the audacity, had said “I have other patients!”</p><p>To which she scanned the empty office and asked “Where?”</p><p>Melina gave in and heard Rio out, which is how they got here now.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Dr. Vostokoff cocked her head incredulously. “She is engaged, for one. Additionally, what if it doesn’t work out <i>again?</i> What will you tell Nicky? How will your daughter take it?”</p><p>“Doc, I can’t just <i>give up</i>. That was my problem to begin with. I’m- I’m ready to do the work.”</p><p>“You are an avoidant.”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll be honest. Psych class was boring as shit and I didn’t pay attention-”</p><p>“You think with logic first.” Melina spoke, waving her pen around as she did. “You push everything down and haven’t faced <i>six</i> years of trauma, of grief.”</p><p>“Ouch.”</p><p>“Agatha is an anxious. She feels first, then calculates how to respond after. She pushes away to be two steps ahead. It is how she protects herself.” The therapist dropped her pen. “Until you are both on the same page, which you aren't, reconciliation would not be my recommendation.”</p><p>“You got that from one month of seeing us?”</p><p>“It’s only my life’s work.” Melina deadpanned.</p><p>The door opened, producing Agatha. “Why is our daughter watching Tiktok in the waiting room?”</p><p>Melina stared her down. “Close the door. Sit.”</p><p>Agatha scrunched her face, slightly offended. “Okay, you might be hot but-”</p><p>“Sit.” The doctor repeated.</p><p>Her ex rolled her eyes, huffing and stomping before sitting next to Rio, notably closer than in previous sessions. Which could mean nothing. Melina took off her glasses, rubbing her face in frustration.</p><p>“I have been practicing for nearly three decades, and in <i>all</i> my years, I have never seen a family with such messy dynamics.”</p><p>“I don’t think-” Rio chirped.</p><p>“Not a question.” Melina held up a hand. “You two have <i>so</i> much to work through and we have only just begun to see the tip of the iceberg. It is apparent to me that you both <i>deeply</i> love and care for Nicky. You are good parents.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha grinned.</p><p>“<i>But</i>, you do not talk. Nicky lashes out, anxious. Then she bolts, avoidant. Your child reflects your behavior.” The doctor continued, “Out of curiosity, how did you handle conflict while you were still married? How did you make it through difficult times?”</p><p>“Um,” Agatha’s voice pitched higher. “We- we had tools.”</p><p>“Like?”</p><p>Rio sunk further into the couch in embarrassment. “Sex.”</p><p>Dr. Vostokoff raised her eyebrows in disbelief. “So, sex was a means of communication? Not uncommon, can be useful.” She nodded to herself, connecting the fucking dots for them. “Tell me, what was the first instance of your marriage breaking down after Alex?”</p><p>“The sex going out.” Agatha answered in shame.</p><p>“So we should fuck again?” Rio asked.</p><p>“NO!” Melina shouted as if there were a flood or fire nearby. “No! What medical professional would prescribe that?!”</p><p>“I don’t know!” Rio defended. “I thought-”</p><p>“You two need to work on communicating without sex being used as a crutch. My god! You’re educated women and you cannot see this! It is clear as day!”</p><p>Agatha pouted, crossing her arms in defiance. “We haven’t even had sex in a year.”</p><p>“10 months and 26 days.” Rio corrected.</p><p>“You keep <i>count?!</i>” Agatha squawked.</p><p>“I think I’m a bit off, but yes.”</p><p>“This is not healthy!” Melina groaned. “If you two want to be together, consequences be damned, then fine!”</p><p>“I never said that!” Agatha said like a little kid who was in trouble. “I have a girlfriend!”</p><p>“Fiancée.” Rio corrected, yet again, out of spite.</p><p>Agatha nearly growled “Fiancée.”</p><p>“I should’ve stayed straight!” Melina ground out, leaning against her chair. “Lesbians are <i>so</i> emotional!”</p><p>Agatha smirked, wiggling her eyebrows. “So you play for our team, huh doc?”</p><p>“She is our child’s therapist!” Rio scolded. “And ours!”</p><p>“You are so lucky that my hourly rate is astronomical and I make boocoo bucks off you.” The doctor sighed, trying to compose herself once again. “Do not touch each other, do not initiate anything. I am serious. It would not be wise. You both are carrying an exorbitant amount of baggage that you have not unpacked. And more so, do you even want to be together? Do you see your relationship as viable?”</p><p>Well, that sucked all the air out of the room.</p><p>The tone turned heavy.</p><p>Because Rio knew her answer.</p><p><i>Yes.</i></p><p>But Agatha’s?</p><p>Rio didn’t know if she could hear her wife disregard her again.</p><p>At the lapsing and prolonged silence, Melina scoffed, pointing between the two of them. “Point made, hopefully.”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha haughtily raised her chin. “Kinda ruined the vibe there.”</p><p>“Let’s bring in Nicky.” Melina muttered, picking up her pen again. “This is <i>family</i> therapy after all.” Then, under her breath, “<i>Tupiye ublyudki</i>.”</p><p>Okay, so Rio needed to translate that from Russian later, because that had to be derogatory. The rest of the session went marginally better, and by better, Rio meant that at least nobody screamed or cried. There was a moment, right at the tail end, where Nicky was explaining how Agatha wasn’t being fair. How Agatha getting engaged was selfish, and well, other things that RIo didn’t particularly <i>like</i> hearing.</p><p>“She just does whatever she wants, doesn’t even care about me.” Nicky said, sandwiched in between them again.</p><p>And Rio saw, she saw in real time her wife <i>react</i> immediately, then calculate the next two steps. She watched as Agatha tensed, then averted her gaze, then set in jaw. The initial sting, followed by the defense of shutting down.</p><p>God damnit, Melina had a point.</p><p>“Teddy, that’s not fair.” Rio stopped her daughter from saying more. “Your mom isn’t selfish for living her life.” At some point, Rio had to take responsibility for her part in everything rather than claiming that it was no one’s fault.</p><p>There was fault.</p><p>On both sides.</p><p>Rio let out a deep breath. “Mija, after Alex, I wasn’t okay. I was gone, I used work as a distraction.” Nicky looked at her, surprised Rio had said her sister’s name. “Your mom and I both had our own issues and instead of fixing them, I took the easy way out. The reason nonna was around so much afterwards was because <i>I</i> was absent. I wasn’t there when she needed me most. I should’ve said this sooner,” She looked past her daughter to her wife. “I should’ve said this sooner. We both did a lot of shit wrong, and I don’t even think I realized how it affected me until a few days ago. I was so focused on time healing every wound, I forgot that you have to actually <i>tend</i> to the wound first. I wanted to move on to spare you the pain, and in the process, I inflicted more.” Rio’s eyes landed back on her daughter. “Your mom is doing the best she can. And you can dislike Wanda, but your mom isn’t selfish. She cares about you more than you’ll ever know.”</p><p>All three sets of eyes <i>stared</i> at Rio.</p><p>Her head swiveled to look at them all. “What?”</p><p>Melina rapidly blinked. “I think that is the most I’ve heard you talk all in one go.”</p><p>Yeah, the death of a six year old will do that. “I talk!”</p><p>Agatha uncomfortably cleared her throat. “Thank you.”</p><p>“How about we end it there today? On a good note?” Melina snapped her notebook shut. “I have an opening next month if you two are smart enough to do another joint session.”</p><p>And nobody would fight that prospect, the three of them getting up and shuffling out of the office. Was there more to say? A literal fuckton. But Rio was proud of herself for taking that leap, for actually taking some responsibility. They filed out into the hallway, her daughter hugging her goodbye, the ritual of her starting her week with Agatha.</p><p>Her ex handed her keys to Nicky. “Could you go start the car, hon? We need to schedule our next session.”</p><p>Their daughter took the keys, her face holding <i>some</i> guilt. “Yeah.”</p><p>Once Nicky was out the door of the practice, Agatha fisted her hand into the hem of Rio’s shirt, all but dragging her into the bathroom. “What the hell was that?!”</p><p>Rio steadied herself, her wife letting go. “What was <i>what?</i>”</p><p>“You told our therapist we kissed, and then to make things worse, you <i>actually</i> participate in therapy?!”</p><p>“You are so fucking confusing, you know that?!” Rio snapped, feeling a lot of emotions at once. “You wanted me to fight, I’m fighting!”</p><p>Agatha popped her hip, an accusatory finger in Rio’s face. “You fucking ratted us out! And now-”</p><p>“Are you pissed that Melina knows or that you’re not <i>actually</i> pissed?” She challenged, catching Agatha’s wrist. “I watch you, Agatha. Just as closely as you watch everyone else. This engagement is already on <i>thin</i> ice, and it’s hard to ignore that hunger when I’m doing what you want me to. Right?”</p><p>Her wife tried to pull her limb back, but Rio didn’t allow it.</p><p>She pulled her close, backing her ex against the nearest wall. “Admit it.”</p><p>“Fuck you.”</p><p>“I’d bet you’d love to.”</p><p>Agatha’s tongue darted out, wetting her lower lip. “Mmh, now who’s the taker? All those women you fuck turn you into a bottom, baby?”</p><p>There it was again, that pet name.</p><p>Agatha had said it Tuesday night, even through the mental anguish Rio had noticed it. And now, again.</p><p>Rio smirked, pinning Agatha’s hips to the wall with her own, pressing herself against her ex. “We both know that you’re too fucking greedy, mi amor.” The hold she had on Agatha’s wrist dropped, opting to thread her fingers through her wife’s hair. Christ, she had missed the feel of it. “Admit it. Admit you want me. Admit this isn’t over.”</p><p>Those eyes, the ones resembling aquamarine, lingered on Rio’s before dragging down to her mouth. Her lashes fluttered as Rio’s nails raked across her scalp, lips parting, pupils dilating. “Did you even bring back my mug?”</p><p>Motherfucker.</p><p>Rio buckled her knee forward, wedging her thigh between Agatha’s. “Nope.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered, but she didn’t move. Not even a fraction.</p><p> “Why’d you bring me into the bathroom?” She leaned in, her lips brushing the shell of her ex’s ear. “It’s right there, Agatha. It’d be so easy to take. To feel. You deserve that, baby.”</p><p>Her wife’s head rolled back, landing against the wall with a light <i>thud</i>. Agatha’s chest rose and fell as if she were gasping for air, an internal struggle happening somewhere in her mind. Rio could help with that, Rio could make it so simple for her.</p><p>She placed a searing kiss just below Agatha’s ear, right on that sweet spot that made her ex weak. “When’s the last time someone made you feel <i>good?</i> Made you feel every ounce of pleasure you’re entitled to?”</p><p>A thread snapped, Agatha’s weight hitting Rio’s thigh with a soft moan. Her ex’s hands pulled at Rio’s hair, something to anchor to. She smiled against Agatha's neck, flexing her leg to give her wife something sturdier to grind on. Hips instinctively rolled, Agatha keening at the pressure which must’ve been hitting her clit the way Rio had intended.</p><p>And while she’d certainly like to do more, time was of the essence here. The seam of Agatha’s jeans was helping, her fingers scrunching in Rio’s locks. She dipped her head down, mouthing along Agatha’s throat. Luckily, her ex had opted for a loose button up with a few undone at the top, plenty of collarbone on display. Agatha had always presented more femme when they were younger but, throughout the years, had progressively incorporated more masculine styling into her wardrobe. The blazers and slacks, the button ups, all if it was so fucking delicious. She still wore dresses or skirts on occasion, dwindling back and forth between femininity and masculinity. Very fucking hot by the way.</p><p>“That’s it, cariño. Take what you need.” Rio murmured, nipping at her clavicle. These perfect little sounds dripped from Agatha’s lips, small breaths, low whimpers. Shit, Rio wished they had more privacy, she longed to hear Agatha’s actual sounds again. Loud and unrestrained.</p><p>Rio wrapped her finger around one of the belt loops on Agatha’s jeans, tugging her along and helping Agatha to get herself off on Rio’s leg. Her ex got the message, her movements becoming messier, needier. “Aw, love.” Rio cooed, “You’re so fucking desperate for it, aren’t you?”</p><p>She looked up, Agatha’s eyes were heavy and barely open, a small nod given in response. Rio victoriously grinned, placing a chaste kiss to her jaw before turning her attention to full, pouty lips. Her wife met her half way, a whine reverberating into Rio’s mouth at the first touch. Agatha’s jaw unhinged, a clear indicator that she wanted more. Rio obliged, licking into her mouth as she pulled at Agatha’s hips more incessantly. She wanted to consume her, ensure that her wife wouldn’t forget this anytime soon.</p><p>“<i>Fuck</i>.” Agatha mumbled, her voice breaking. “Oh god, baby-”</p><p>“Feel good?”</p><p>“So <i>fucking good</i>.”</p><p>“Just my thigh, mi amor? Shit, she hasn’t been fucking you right if you’re pathetic enough to hump my leg.” Rio tilted her head, a condescending tone seeping into her words. “Has she <i>ever</i> made you come, or is that right reserved for me and your own hand?”</p><p>Agatha’s hips snapped, the degradation only fueling her. “Rio.”</p><p>“Are you going to think about this for the next time? When she’s fumbling around, unable to get the job done?” And because she knew Agatha’s needs like the back of her own hand, she let her fingers slither from Agatha’s hair down to her neck, <i>squeezing</i>. “I want you to.”</p><p>Her wife’s face flushed pink, eyes glazed over with lust, black eating away any blue.</p><p>“I want you to think back to this moment that next time she’s on top of you.” Rio husked. “About me choking you while you grind against me. How fucking needy you are. How my voice drives you fucking insane. I want you to remember it all. Because we both know that’s the only shot in hell she’s going to have at making you feel anything.”</p><p>“Oh, fuck-”</p><p>“Do you have to think about me just to get wet?” Rio asked, grabbing at Agatha’s ass because…well, because she could. “‘Cause I doubt that cabrona does it for you the way I do.”</p><p>A nearly silent cry ripped from Agatha’s throat, muted by the pressure Rio had on it. “Please.”</p><p>“Does she beg for you? She know how pretty you sound when you beg? God, such a fucking waste.” It almost physically pained Rio, to know that Agatha was willingly denying herself that. “You’re so beautiful when you cry, and plead, and fucking <i>beg</i>.”</p><p>She knew her wife had to be close, Agatha’s hips becoming uncoordinated, thrusting faster and faster. Rio could also feel how warm Agatha was at the apex of her own thighs, shit, she had to be drenched by now. Rio reached up, grabbing Agatha’s jaw and disingenuously pouting. “Oh, mi vida, are you close?”</p><p>“Y- yeah.” Agatha said, breathy as her fingers nearly ripped out Rio’s hair. “So close. So, so…fucking close.”</p><p>Rio smugly curled her lips. “Admit it, then.”</p><p>“Fuck off.”</p><p>Rio’s hand dropped, both returning to Agatha’s hips “That’s a shame.” and <i>pushing</i> back. She removed her leg, locking her knee again. Rio peered down, the faintest wet spot on her own pants. She bitterly chuckled, running her index and middle finger over the stain and holding it up. “You soaked through.”</p><p>“What the fuck?!” Agatha hissed, clawing and trying to pull Rio back.</p><p>She took a step back, disentangling. “Don’t be mad, at least I got you farther than Wanda ever has.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped in shock. “Rio-”</p><p>“You’ll get to come when you admit this isn’t over,” She popped the digits into her mouth, the taste almost nonexistent but definitely <i>there</i>. Rio moaned, fucking aching to drop to her knees right here, right now and eat Agatha out. “Wouldn’t want to do anything untoward with a taken woman.”</p><p>Her ex stood there, gobsmacked and blue balled. “You fucking asshole!”</p><p>Once her fingers were clean, she shrugged. “Maybe your fiancée could help.” She reached for the doorknob. “Or <i>should</i>, at least.” Rio swiftly left and let the door shut behind her, wondering if Agatha would take the loss or endure the humiliation of having to rub one out in a public bathroom.</p><p>She supposed it didn’t matter. Yes, it was fucking agony not to see Agatha come in her pants from something as juvenile as dry humping, but it would pay off in the long run. Her wife needed a wake up call, one that Rio lovingly supplied. Because her ex was the type to let her frustration get bigger than her, so stubborn that it’d bite her in the ass eventually. And Rio was good at waiting, and had been doing it for long enough.</p><p>Melina didn’t know how badly this was needed, if the sex came back, so would the communication. Rio was sure of it, plus, sex with Agatha was always a bonus. She stepped out of the practice feeling great, hopeful about what was to come, namely, Agatha.</p><p>Rio stopped at her wife’s car on the way to her own, knocking on the passenger side window to speak to her daughter. Nicky rolled down the window, heat blasting. “God, took you guys long enough.”</p><p>“I need you to do a favor for me.”</p><p>Nicky’s brows furrowed. “Okay?”</p><p>“Be nicer to your mom. She’s a little….<i>pent up</i> right now. I meant what I said in there, she’s doing her best. I know you’re hurting, but that engagement isn’t going to last. Your mom is trying to do what she thinks is best, just give me some time.”</p><p>“Do I have to be nice to The Crimson Chin?”</p><p>Rio barked out a laugh. “Not my purview, I’m focused on <i>our</i> family.”</p><p>Her daughter crossed her arms, considering. “Fine, deal. But can you up my allowance for New York with nonna next month?”</p><p>“Sold.” Rio smiled, shoving her head through the window to kiss Nicky’s.</p><p>“Mami!” Nicky blanched. “I’m too old for that.”</p><p>“No you’re not, <i>princesa</i>.”</p><p>“You know I hate that name.”</p><p>Rio stood up straight again. “And yet you’ll always be <i>mi princesa</i>. Funny how that works.”</p><p>“Nerd.”</p><p>“Love you too.” Rio called back, walking to her own car and starting it. She waited to see Agatha leave the practice before pulling out of the spot, her ex looking no different; unsatisfied. Her guess was that Agatha had denied herself <i>yet again</i>.</p><p>Damn, Rio was hoping for public masturbation.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha was splayed on her back, stomach contracting, legs shaking. Her body covered in sweat as her hands burrowed in the head of hair currently bobbing between her thighs. Every inch of her on high alert as warm, soft lips sucked at her clit. She arched her back, a hand slithering up her body and grabbing her breast, methodical fingers rolling her nipple as she cried out.</p><p>Completely naked and <i>wanting</i>, holding on as though her life depended on it. She heard herself, her sounds, how they’d give a pornstar a run for their money. And yet, she couldn’t stop. Her eyes screwed shut as liquid heat swirled <i>low</i> in her belly.</p><p><i>When had Wanda gotten fucking fantastic at this?</i></p><p>Two fingers worked inside her, pumping and curling just how she needed them to. The stretch felt <i>divine</i>, her mouth dry as she gulped down oxygen. At the addition of a third, Agatha pried her eyes open. Her lips forming an ‘O’ shape as she moaned, hips undulating with need. <i>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</i></p><p>“Feel good?”</p><p>Agatha, too focused on her impending orgasm, just responded– “So, so good.”</p><p>Wanda stopped, pulling back.</p><p>She flicked her eyes down.</p><p>The hair weaved through her knuckles was <i>not</i> red.</p><p>The eyes staring back at her were <i>not</i> green.</p><p>The smirk of her ex wife, charming tooth gap.</p><p>The contracting of her walls around slender, familiar fingers. Fingers with blunt and dull nails, no acrylics.</p><p><i>Rio.</i></p><p><i>”Admit it, then.”</i></p><p>She flinched back, scrambling to the other side of the bed in shock. “Fuck!”</p><p>Rio simply blinked at her, rather curiously. Her lips still shiny, still curled up in victory. <i>”Admit it. Admit you want me. Admit this isn’t over.”</i></p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. Her heart racing more now than it had two seconds ago on the brink of climax. Fully aware she was <i>naked</i>, she grabbed at the sheets, they were the ones they had while they were still married, and covered herself. The walls were the lighter green they once were, the room bathed in a warm glow. Comforting. Safe. Like how everything used to be.</p><p>Her ex wife crawled onto the bed, a gentle hand cupping her cheek. <i>“When’s the last time someone made you feel good? Made you feel every ounce of pleasure you’re entitled to?”</i></p><p>“I- I don’t know.”</p><p><i>“I’ve missed you.”</i></p><p>Agatha’s throat constricted, bubbling with something heavier than sorrow. “I’ve missed you too. I’ve missed this.” She grabbed Rio’s wrist, holding it.</p><p><i>“Why do you keep me coming back?”</i></p><p>“I…”</p><p><i>“Why do you keep me coming back?”</i></p><p>“I-”</p><p><i>“Why do you keep me coming back?”</i></p><p>Agatha woke up drenched in a cold sweat, disjointed as she snapped up in bed. 3AM, room pitch black save for the moonlight spilling in through the blinds. Heart thrumming against her ribs, lungs heaving. She clutched at her chest, eyes wandering to the other side of the bed.</p><p>A bundle of red hair spilled out onto the pillow next to her, Wanda’s body faced away. “Babe, there’s no bassinet, there’s no baby crying. It was just a dream, go back to sleep.” Wanda slurred, half asleep.That was referring to her <i>other</i> semi-regularly occurring dream. The one where Agatha unraveled a bundled infant, only to find the bassinet devoid of her child.</p><p>She preferred the Rio dream.</p><p>Agatha got up, linen pants and wool sweater on her frame, her underwear sticking to her. Every fucking night. That same dream. It always ended the same. And Agatha never gave an answer to the Rio in her mind. Over a month since the bathroom at the therapist’s office, over a month since she’d <i>almost</i> felt something.</p><p>There’d been no more instances of touching.</p><p>She implemented rules for herself.</p><p>Number one: Never be alone with Rio. Not without Nicky or someone else there. No bathrooms, no closets, no cars, <i>nothing</i>.</p><p>Number two: Keep conversation to therapy or Nicky. Only two topics of discussion they should be having anyways. And Rio had <i>tried</i>, tried goading her, making her crack. Her ex seemed to have been growing a fancy new backbone over the past six weeks. Didn’t really help rule number one since the fighting back was inexplicably hot. Seriously, Rio being mean was arousing to a very concerning degree.</p><p>Number three: Absolutely <i>no</i> touching. None. Not a hug, not a handshake, not a push or an accidental bump. Nothing. Zip. Zero. Nada. Couldn’t tempt her if she never touched her.</p><p>Six weeks and her rules had not failed her yet, although, she would be remiss not to mention how horny breaking said rules made her. Additionally, now Rio was forbidden by an authority figure, that being their therapist. Do <i>you</i> know how satisfying it is to defy authority? Agatha sure fucking does.</p><p>However, she ignored the bigger issue. Which was why she wanted her ex wife so damn bad. Why Rio consumed her thoughts, took up space in her brain. She technically always had, always would. But that didn’t mean Agatha had to like it. In fact, it was really inconvenient.</p><p>She also kept Rio and Wanda separate, not wanting to find out if her ex was petty enough to say something incriminating to her girlfriend. Fiancée. God damnit. Wanda was her <i>fiancée</i>, it should be easier to remember that with how annoying Wanda was about planning. There was a reason Agatha eloped for her first marriage, weddings are fucking stupid and a waste of money.</p><p>But, Wanda wanted the works. Big wedding, long guest list, a whole spectacle. She was overwhelmingly traditional in that sense, much to Agatha’s chagrin. She shuffled downstairs, the house eerily absent of sound. Nicky had left for New York with Lilia yesterday, a yearly tradition. Her mom liked Broadway musicals, and Nicky liked getting out of Boston. They usually went for a long weekend as a small vacation, which was important, especially post-Alex. Agatha and her ex wanted to make sure that Nicky didn’t feel like she was living in the shadow of her younger sibling. So, missing a day of school to play hooky with her nonna was fine.</p><p>Agatha grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge, swallowing the cold water in the hopes of stoking the broiling coals inside of her. Everything about that day in the bathroom was…wrong, technically. Wanda didn’t deserve that. It was also, most unfortunately, the best she’d felt in <i>a while</i>. She considered breaking things off with Wanda afterwards, but one day didn’t change much, she needed to see Rio actually keep her word.</p><p>And for the last month and a half, her ex had. Rio had been more vocal in the past six weeks than in the past six years. Participating in therapy, challenging Agatha and pushing back. There had been one day, about a month back, where Rio picked up Nicky in a motherfucking <i>suit</i> of all things. Black, perfectly tailored,<i>hot</i>. Her ex explained she had attended Billy’s funeral and didn’t have time to change. Agatha hastily handed over their child before bolting upstairs and opening her phone and pulling up her hidden <i>R</i> folder.</p><p>Listen, Agatha knew it was bad. She is not unaware of her actions. But she needed to feel a sense of security with Rio again if she was even going to contemplate leaving her current relationship, and that hadn’t manifested yet, so, she stayed with Wanda despite the woman getting on her nerves to no fucking end. No, Agatha did not care about the difference between eggshell and cream table linens. She didn’t entertain Wanda’s whining about an engagement party or the wedding, because she was steadfast in the belief that they wouldn’t get <i>near</i> that altar until Nicky was onboard.</p><p>Or until Agatha was fully onboard, if she were to be honest with herself.</p><p>Although Nicky had been shockingly better towards Agatha, her opinion and behavior towards Wanda didn’t move an inch. Her daughter seemed to have been slowly coming around to the fact that life after Alex had been harder for Agatha than she once thought. That perhaps her mami wasn’t a saint. Obviously Nicky knew that Agatha had suffered physically and was sad for a long time, but maybe the whole ‘abandonment’ aspect made something click in the thirteen year old’s mind. No hugging occurred, but there were less meltdowns.</p><p>Therapy had <i>some</i> benefits, she supposed.</p><p>Speaking of, Agatha groaned aloud, capping her water bottle. The snow fell fast and heavy outside, a blizzard forecasted for this weekend. Perfect weather for therapy with your ex in twelve hours. On Valentine’s day of all days, dumb fucking Melina and her booked patient calendar. Yeah, who wants to go to fucking therapy on Valentine’s? She felt a smidge of guilt at first, but then Wanda told her she had a work conference in California anyway. They had gone out to dinner last night, Agatha going through the motions of playing a loving partner.</p><p>They didn’t have sex, though. Hadn’t in six weeks. Agatha chalked it up to her early onset menopause killing her libido. A lie. If anything, her libido had been on fire. Rio had messed with her mind and now she couldn’t ignore everything swirling around in there. Wanda was understanding at first, but the longer it went, the more frustrated she became. The small comments and annoyed sighs when Agatha denied her, not enough to cause an actual fight, just enough to let Agatha know she was pissed.</p><p>She looked down at her engagement ring, scowling. Maybe she just needed to recommit to her relationship with Wanda, it wasn’t fair to keep her <i>and</i> Rio on hold. Melina’s words rattled around in her head <i>Do you see your relationship as viable?</i></p><p>With Rio?</p><p>Oh, who fucking knows.</p><p>With Wanda?</p><p>Eh…maybe?</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Agatha deflated, leaning against a countertop in near darkness. She heard the creaking of footsteps coming down the stairs, Wanda sleepily walking into the kitchen with a small smile.</p><p>“Why are you up?”</p><p>Wanda yawned, grabbing the water from Agatha and taking a sip. “Monica’s picking me up for the airport in an hour. We had to move our flight up to get out of the city before the blizzard hits tonight.”</p><p>“Monica?”</p><p>“Yeah, my co-worker. I told you this, she’s like my work wife.” Wanda laughed. “We’re carpooling.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows, still tired. “Beats having to drop you off at the gate.”</p><p>Wanda’s smile faded, anxiously rolling the water bottle between her hands. “Are you going to miss me?”</p><p>“What?” Agatha forced a chuckle. “Of course I am, hon.”</p><p>“Doesn’t feel like it.”</p><p>“I’m just grumpy.” She lied. “Not looking forward to therapy this afternoon.”</p><p>“You’ve been grumpy a lot lately.” Wanda muttered.</p><p>“Is that code for ‘you won’t fuck me’?”</p><p>“Well…”</p><p>“What.” Agatha said, but not as a question.</p><p>“You won’t!” Wanda raised her hands defensively. “I know you can’t control it, but I just miss it, okay?”</p><p>“How about you make me feel <i>more</i> guilty about it? That’ll definitely yield the best results-”</p><p>“Oh my fucking god. Nevermind.” Wanda rolled her eyes, turning to leave. “I have to pack and get dressed.”</p><p>“Love you too.” Agatha sniped, rubbing her temples.</p><p>Her girlfriend whipped around, snapping. “So you <i>really</i> want to instigate shit right now?!”</p><p>And no, she didn’t, she was too fucking tired.</p><p>And not just bodily.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Wanda scoffed, turning the corner. “That’s what I thought.”</p><p>An hour later, a very nice woman named Monica collected Wanda, her girlfriend kissing her cheek like nothing had transpired earlier. “Remember to start getting your half of the invite list drafted up.”</p><p>Agatha bit her tongue, it was going to start looking like a pincushion soon. “Yup.”</p><p>“I love you.” Wanda slung her designer duffel over her shoulder, opening the door.</p><p>“You too.” Agatha said, the door shutting a moment later.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around herself, completely alone.</p><p>No Wanda. No Nicky. No one.</p><p>She climbed the stairs, intending to try to go back to sleep. When she got to the top, her eyes hovered at the end of the hall. To the right was the master bedroom, Agatha’s. A few steps down to the left was Nicky’s room, then a bathroom. And at the very end of the hall was the nursery. It had been Nicky’s when she was a baby, most of the furniture just recycled for their second child. Though they had chosen a different color scheme, repainted the walls, personalized it with different stuffies or ‘A’ decor.</p><p>Agatha might as well have sealed that door shut, welded off the hundred fifty square feet in her brain. But, her feet kept her moving towards <i>that</i> door. Her hand tremored as she turned the knob. The audible <i>creak</i> of the hinges echoed in her skull, the nursery coming into view. There was a thick layer of dust coating everything. The pale periwinkle they had chosen appeared dull on the walls, the crib still as empty as the day she came home from the hospital.</p><p>She and Rio had redone it when they first found out Agatha was pregnant, ignorant to even the possibility of something happening. Agatha slumped against the doorway, ingraining every detail that she had already memorized. The small dino plushie in the rocking chair, the changing table that remained stocked with diapers and wipes, the hand-painted <i>Alexandria</i> on the wall above the crib, done by Agatha herself.</p><p>Nicky’s color scheme was pink, they kind of went overboard on the girly girl bullshit. Sue them, it was 2012. But Agatha always associated Alex with purpley blue, perhaps because she was a winter baby and so cool toned colors made sense. Agatha’s crossed arms felt like steel against her ribcage, the pressure soothing. Her lower lip trembled, the tears welling but not falling.</p><p>She didn’t come into this room, never had the courage. One day she’d pack it up, one day she’d make something better of it. But, for now, this was enough of a step for her. Simply <i>looking</i> at her child’s room. The one made just for her, even if she was never an occupant.</p><p>Agatha sniffled, grabbing the knob and letting the latch softly <i>click</i> shut.</p><hr/><p>“Okay, see?” Jen whined. “This is why I hate being exiled! I don’t know anything!”</p><p>Rio chuckled, sat at a table in the hospital cafeteria with Jen and Alice. She glanced down at her watch, needing to leave soon for therapy. “Alice <i>isn’t</i> exiled and I only just told her a couple days back.”</p><p>Jen side eyed her wife. “And you didn’t tell me that she was having some homoerotic game of chicken with Agatha?”</p><p>Alice mumbled “Sorry.” through a bite of her muffin.</p><p>Jen scoffed but turned her attention back to Rio. “And she hasn’t cracked yet?”</p><p>“Nope.” She sighed. “Six weeks and <i>nothing</i>. I’m pretty sure she’s avoiding me whenever she’s not using our daughter as a human cockblock.”</p><p>“Damn, Raphael has her whipped.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows knitted together in confusion. “Wha…?”</p><p>“Like the ninja turtle.” Jen smiled. “And speaking of Nicky, how is my god daughter whom I never get to see?”</p><p>“She is with her nonna in New York. They’re seeing a play called Death Becomes Her?”</p><p>“Oh, a gay classic.” Jen nodded.</p><p>“I guess.” She stood, grabbing the two hot chocolates. “I gotta go get my head shrunk.”</p><p>“You go get your wife who’s already engaged to another woman!” Jen shouted in support. “Happy Valentine’s!”</p><p>“You too, lovebirds!” Rio moved both cups to one hand, using her free one to flip them off as she walked away. The snow was a pain in the ass to drive in, her SUV working its hardest not to skid. The blizzard wasn’t supposed to pick up until tonight, but at this rate, most of Boston would be snowed in way sooner. She got to the practice in one piece, careful not to lose her balance in the parking lot. Rio waltzed into the waiting room, spotting her ex in one of the chairs.</p><p>She approached, holding out a cup. “M’lady.”</p><p>Agatha peered up from her phone in confusion, grabbing the cup. “Thanks…?”</p><p>“You’re very welcome.” Rio sat beside her, sipping her own. “Thought it might brighten up the day.”</p><p>“Is it spiked with anything?” Her ex asked, popping off the lid and sniffing.</p><p>“No, of course not.”</p><p>Agatha fisted the cap back on, pouting. “That’s a shame.”</p><p>“I think I have some tequila back at home...”</p><p>“Good for you.”</p><p>Rio chuckled to herself, looking at her wife. “So, you wanna tell Melina about the bathroom, or should I?”</p><p>“We’re not telling her dick.”</p><p>“Oh? We’re not?”</p><p>“Nope. Doubt it would result in anything but another verbal lashing.”</p><p>“I still have to look up what she called us last time.”</p><p>“Stupid bastards.” Agatha answered, taking a swig of the hot chocolate.</p><p>“How do you know that?”</p><p>“Russian and Sokovian have a lot of overlap. Wanda’s big into women’s soccer, swears like a sailor at the TV.”</p><p>Ah, and back to Wanda.</p><p>“How is the fiancée?”</p><p>“Great.” Agatha said way too quickly.</p><p>“She all broken up that you’re spending Valentine’s with me?”</p><p>“She’s on a work trip, some marketing conference.”</p><p>“What could that possibly entail?”</p><p>“I don’t know. They go to a convention center, get a bunch of free shit, drink, and go home.”</p><p>“Fuck, I chose the wrong career path.”</p><p>“My thoughts exactly-”</p><p>Melina appeared in the doorway, ushering them in. “Guys.”</p><p>They both stood, reluctantly entering and taking their usual seats.</p><p>Their doctor smiled, waiting.</p><p>They stared back.</p><p>Melina clasped her hands together patiently.</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha side eyed Rio.</p><p>“What?” Her wife finally barked.</p><p>Melina crinkled her face. “I was waiting for you two to start.”</p><p>“Why?” Rio asked.</p><p>“It is your time.”</p><p>“Sounds like someone doesn't wanna do their joooooob.” Agatha sing-songed under her breath.</p><p>Rio snickered, quickly trying to hide her reaction.</p><p>“Fine.” Melina kept her mouth in a straight line. “How have things been since the kiss? Does your partner know about your infidelity?”</p><p>Agatha grimaced. “No. Why would I tell her?”</p><p>“Honesty is usually good for a relationship.”</p><p>“C’mon, doc.” Rio simpered. “That can <i>grind</i> on a burgeoning marriage. Especially ‘cause it’s me. Could <i>rub</i> Wanda the wrong way. I wouldn’t want to create a <i>hump</i> for them to have to get over. The last thing they need is a <i>rut</i>.”</p><p>Agatha choked on her hot chocolate, sputtering out “I don’t think it’d be productive.”</p><p>Melina sighed, pen in hand. “Okay, let’s come back to that. I want to get into something else today anyways.”</p><p>“Like what?” Rio tilted her head, suddenly anxious.</p><p>“I want to hear your recount of the day Alex was born.” The doctor said, no sympathy in her tone, direct.</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Oh, that shouldn’t be hard, right? What, with all your <i>progress</i>.”</p><p>Rio’s face fell, giving a cold glance to her ex before responding. “Why? You heard Agatha explain everything.”</p><p>“Yes, but there are two of you. Alex was your child together. Agatha is not the only one who suffered a loss that day.”</p><p>She cleared her throat, shifting in her seat. “Uh, fine.”</p><hr/><p><b>February, 2020.</b></p><p>“Rio, wake up.” Her wife strained out. “I- I’m bleeding.”</p><p>And since Rio hadn’t slept a fucking wink throughout Agatha’s entire pregancy, she shot up and out of bed on a dime. It wasn’t a lack of love for Alex that made Rio resent the pregnancy, it was the disregard Agatha had for her own life. Her wife had spent nearly eight months incubating their child who wasn’t bound to live more than a week at best. And though Rio wanted their second child, she couldn’t justify Alex at the cost of Agatha. Rio wanted Alex, but not at the cost of Agatha.</p><p>That killed Rio on the inside, the guilt slowly gnawing at her, taking chunk after chunk out of her. Because what mother would think that way? She had worked in the medical field long enough to see the scene play out. Mother’s life sacrificed by fathers for the sake of the child. She had operated on premies who would never know their mother, never truly understand what she went through so they could breathe. She’d witnessed the husbands, teary eyed and broken, mourn his partner while simultaneously resenting his child.</p><p>Rio didn’t resent Alex, but she felt a way she couldn’t describe. Or maybe she was just too afraid to acknowledge that, internally, she’d kept her attachment to her daughter at bay. The entire pregnancy, Rio ignored the grief, put it in a dark corner along with her connection to Alex. Because their daughter wouldn’t live, and she might take Agatha with her.</p><p>Rio felt selfish, she felt evil. But all she could contemplate was how’d she tell their seven year old that mama’s not coming home. Replay in her mind what Agatha’s grave would look like, how the hell Rio was meant to raise Nicky alone. She needed her mom, Rio couldn’t be the both of them. The next twenty years flashed through Rio’s mind. Nicky’s high school and college graduation, looking for her mom in the crowd, only to find Rio standing alone. What about Nicky’s wedding? Agatha had to be there to take her dress shopping. What about grandkids? Agatha would never meet them.</p><p>And what about Rio? What if Rio needed Agatha just as badly? What if she needed her wife? They were supposed to grow old together. They were forever. The end wasn’t here yet, and Rio couldn’t go on if it was. Was that selfish? It was Agatha’s body, it was her autonomy. Rio’s rage had been at a low simmer for the better part of a year. Because Agatha had made peace with abandoning them, leaving Rio and Nicky behind.</p><p>But Rio was the strong one, the one relied upon, so she didn’t voice any of that.</p><p>She did her job.</p><p>Rio called Jen, then the hospital so that everything would be ready shortly after their arrival. She sat by Agatha’s hospital bed, knee bouncing, eyes trained on her wife’s monitor.</p><p>Jen burst into the room, trying to smile. “How are we feeling?”</p><p>Agatha, pale and trembling, pursed her lips in defiance.  “Great, I want to push.”</p><p>That had Rio standing up. “No, you’re not pushing.”</p><p>“Yes, I am. I’m here, I’m going to push.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said. “What Rio means is, you <i>can’t</i>. Not with your body already struggling to keep you and her alive. Your blood pressure alone has told us that much. If you deliver vaginally, it could be fatal to both you and her. We need to do a C-section, they’re prepping the O.R. right now.”</p><p>Agatha looked over to Rio, her voice thick. “You have to <i>promise me</i> that if I wake up, Alex will be waiting for me.”</p><p><i>If?</i></p><p>Rio’s brows knitted together. “Mi amor, you’ll wake up-”</p><p>“Not at the cost of her.”</p><p>“Alice is on standby for whatever Alex will need.” Jen placated. “She’ll be in good hands.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t let her eyes leave Rio’s. “<i>Promise me</i>.”</p><p>She <i>couldn’t</i>.</p><p>“Baby,” Rio grabbed her hand, lacing their fingers together. “Jen’s going to get Alex out, Alice will get her to the NICU, you’ll wake up.”</p><p>“Not at the cost of her.” Agatha repeated. “I want her to go knowing one of us,  and if I’m not here, then it’s got to be you.”</p><p>How was Rio expected to focus on ferrying Alex’s soul when Agatha’s would be in the balance?</p><p>“I won’t let anything happen to you, Agatha.” Rio’s eyes brimmed. “I’m not trading your life for hers.”</p><p>Her wife whipped her head over to Jen. “If anything happens, save Alex.”</p><p>Jen’s face fell. “Agatha, when you’re under, your next of kin decides. And medically-”</p><p>“I don’t care!” She hissed, suddenly feeling sick. “You save her.” Agatha’s gaze swept back to Rio, tears making her vision blur. “Please.” She whispered. “Please, my love. Please let her live. You have to-”</p><p>What about us?</p><p>“Nothing’s going to happen, cariño. You’ll be fine.” Rio gently told, trying to sound convincing. “I promise, as soon as you wake up, we can see her, okay?”</p><p>“I-”</p><p>Another pair of scrubs informed Jen the O.R. was ready, a flurry of medical personnel gathering. “We gotta go.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand, placing a kiss on her forehead. “I’ll be in the gallery. I’ll be there the whole time. Nothing bad is going to happen.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, the salt of her tears beginning to stain her skin. “I’m…I’m scared.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I want more time.” Agatha hiccupped, her fingers splayed on her swollen stomach. “I want more time.”</p><p>Rio smiled, though it was one devoid of joy. “If I could break all the rules of nature to give that to you, I would.” Her eyes flitted to Agatha’s monitor, heartbeat getting sluggish, blood pressure high. “But they’ve got to go now, any longer and neither of you-” Rio cut herself off, clearing her throat. “They’ve got to go now.”</p><p>She savored the last touch of Agatha’s fingers in hers, holding on until the bed was finally rolled far enough away. Rio made her way to the O.R. gallery, Mass Gen was a teaching hospital so observation rooms were fairly common. She didn’t like not being in the O.R. but Jen had made it clear back when they scheduled the original C-section, Rio was not permitted in there. And she understood why, Jen was worried about her being in that close of proximity and backseat operating. Emotions get in the way with surgery, the attachment can cloud judgement.</p><p>Rio took her seat, fingers clasped together, elbow resting on her knees. Seeing her wife cut open, while not ideal, didn’t bother her much. After so many years in medicine, you train yourself when to look through a medical lens. Besides, C-sections only take forty-five minutes or less. She inhaled a heavy breath through her nose, Agatha would be fine, Alex would be as fine as possible. Everyone would be <i>fine</i>.</p><p>Alice was off to the side along with a few pediatric nurses, diligently waiting for the hand off. Jen worked as quickly as she could, mindful that Agatha had already lost a substantial amount of blood on the way over here.</p><p>And yet-</p><p>Rio jumped up, fifteen minutes in and Jen hadn’t gotten Alex out, she banged on the glass. Jen peered up at her, barely shaking her head.  She bashed the intercom button. “What the hell are you doing?”</p><p>“LUS is too thick, I can’t-”</p><p>“Jen, get Alex out. Agatha is losing too much blood, I can fucking <i>see</i> it.”</p><p>“Oh, thank you, I hadn’t thought of that!”</p><p>“Agatha’s going to hemorrhage if you don’t-”</p><p>“I am aware!” Jen hissed, “The fetal malformations, Alex is too sick and the low uterine segment is too thick. If I pull Alex out now, I risk losing them both.”</p><p>“If you keep Alex in, Agatha’s gonna bleed out.” Rio barked, because either way, Agatha wouldn’t fare well. The longer she was open, the worse the outcome. Her body was too weak for the surgery to begin with.</p><p>Alex wouldn’t have more than a day with how premature she was, those hours would be spent in unending pain. And shouldn’t a mother protect her child from that? From agony?</p><p>“I can’t let Alex die.”</p><p>“You can’t let <i>my wife</i> die!”</p><p>“Agatha said-”</p><p>“Jen!”</p><p>“Agatha said-”</p><p>Rio set her jaw, making the decision before she realized she had. “Agatha is unconscious and I am her next of kin. I am telling you to save her. Legally and medically, you know I am right. Viability and quality of life. You are under an obligation to listen to my wishes. You save <i>Agatha</i>. Now!”</p><p>“And there’s the hemorrhage." Jen looked up one more time, shoulders slumping. “Alice, get ready.”</p><p>Shit, Rio had to get down there. If Alex wasn’t going to make it for Agatha, Rio had to be there for their daughter. She took off, sprinting down a floor and into the O.R., Alex had to go knowing one of them. If she hadn’t respected Agatha’s first wish, she’d try like hell to respect this one. She grabbed a mask, a cap, and a gown, throwing them on, running through the doors.</p><p>She closed her eyes for a beat, opening them and still seeing her worst nightmare. Rio walked past Agatha on the table, Jen shouting too many orders all at once. Honestly, the whole world sounded like white noise. Going deeper and deeper into the room, approaching Alice standing over Alex. And it was already over. Rio couldn’t have been more than a minute or two, but Alice–</p><p>Her best friend, voice shaking, uttered “Time of death,” and peeked at the clock on the wall. “<i>11:11</i>.”</p><p>The irony in angel numbers.</p><p>The cruelty.</p><hr/><p>Rio dug the heels of her palms into her eyes, trying to stop the sobs. “Fuck, sorry.”</p><p>Melina handed her a box of tissues. “It is okay.”</p><p>Agatha’s face was streaked with tears, her teeth gnawing at her lower lip.</p><p>“I would’ve crawled on my hands and knees, begging to the gods to have another way.” Rio said, voice breaking. “But, I- I couldn’t- I couldn’t let Agatha die.”</p><p>“What happened after?”</p><p>“Uh, Agatha got some blood transfusions-”</p><p>“Not to Agatha. To you.”</p><p>“I held her.” Rio nearly whispered. “Hoped that she’d still feel it somehow.”</p><p>Agatha sniffled, silent.</p><p>Melina looked at her ex wife. “Have you ever heard Rio’s side before? From start to finish?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha swallowed. “I knew she held Alex but, I guess I filled in the blanks myself.”</p><p>“I also didn’t correct it.” Rio added.</p><p>The doctor bounced her gaze between the two. “So, Agatha blames herself for Alex’s illness, Rio blames herself for Alex’s death.” She tilted her head, eyes narrowing. “Do you blame each other for either of those things?”</p><p>“Of course not.” Rio answered.</p><p>“No.” Agatha responded.</p><p>“Agatha,” Melina zeroed in. “Do you think you might harbor a grudge over Rio’s denial of your autonomy?”</p><p>“It was a necessary surgery-”</p><p>“Medical or not, the body holds trauma.” Melina interrupted. “So do you?”</p><p>Agatha wiped her face, looking down at her lap. “Yes.”</p><p>“Rio, you mentioned feeling resentful of Agatha. Do you think you still feel that way? You were scared and angry that she was at peace with dying, did you feel left behind?”</p><p>“I understood where she was coming from-”</p><p>“Did. You.”</p><p>“Yes.” Rio croaked. “And I think I still do.”</p><p>Melina opened her mouth to speak, a blaring alarm sounded out from all three of their phones. Everyone scrambled for their devices, the national weather service declaring the blizzard unsafe and urging people to stay home, along with road closures being released. Rio groaned, Agatha’s own following.</p><p>The therapist sighed. “Okay, it looks like we have to cut this session short. Not ideal considering I’m sure you’re both feeling very vulnerable. I promise, I will schedule another one in a few days, even if I have to stay late. However, unless we all want to be snowed in together, I suggest we hightail it out of here.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha’s voice clipped, throwing on her jacket. “Thanks.”</p><p>Rio steadied herself, standing and following her wife out. “Will you get home alright, Dr. Vostokoff?”</p><p>“Oh, I live around the corner. Why do you think I take patients on the weekend?”</p><p>“Goodnight.”</p><p>“Get home safe.”</p><p>Rio caught up with Agatha, looking out the double doors of that practice at the snow whipping around. “Fuck, that picked up fast.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, palm out. “Give me your keys.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I’ll drive you home. Your car will do better on the roads anyways.”</p><p>“I- I can drive.”</p><p>“No, you can’t. You’re crying. Just,” She made a ‘gimme’ motion with her hand. “Let me take you home.”</p><p>“I’m fine, I promise.”</p><p>“Rio,” blue eyes like stained glass burrowed into her. “I don’t want you to be alone right now. I know how it feels, it sucks. The thoughts that come after reliving that day, they-” She sucked in a breath. “I don’t want to be alone. Just give me your damn keys.”</p><p>“How will you get home?”</p><p>“Guess I won’t.” Agatha shrugged. “There are worse places to be trapped. Plus, I hear there’s tequila awaiting me.”</p><p>Rio weakly smiled, finally giving her wife the keys. “Don’t kill us.”</p><p>“I’m a good driver!”</p><p>“No, baby. You’re not.”</p><p>“So you don’t want me to donuts in the parking lot? The adrenaline will make you forget your sadness.”</p><p>“My car is insured but that’s not a free pass to crash it.”</p><p>Agatha opened the door, wind howling. “No, I think it is.”</p><p>“Agathaaaaa-”</p><p>“I’m joking!” She grinned. “...A little.”</p>
