<div class="userstuff">
<p>They met in 2007 at a bar after Rio had just gotten off an absolutely hellish shift at the hospital. She had walked in for the cheap drinks, being a resident meant she never had <i>any</i> money. Her student loan debt alone was enough to make her question why she decided to become a doctor. Rio smoothed out her black muscle tank and jeans as she found a stool at the bar. It was a random Tuesday night, the patrons few and far between. She ordered her usual, a god awful $4 beer, and alternated between sipping and anxiously peeling at the label.</p><p>“Surgeon?” A raspy voice asked, the scent of iris and amber enveloping her senses.</p><p>Rio whipped around, taking in the owner of the voice. A woman, probably not much younger than Rio. Wild waves cascading down to her stomach, sly quirk of full lips, eyes that resembled aquamarine with pale green right around the pupil. Her nose alone had Rio smiling back. The woman was holding a drink, low rise jeans showing off a sliver of lower stomach where her green baby tee ended.</p><p>“Uh-” Rio cleared her throat, “Yeah. How’d you know?”</p><p>The other woman climbed onto the stool next to her. “Other than the fact that this is the closest bar to Mass Gen, your hands.”</p><p>“My hands?”</p><p>“Your fingers, specifically.”</p><p>“You were staring at my fingers?”</p><p>“Well,” She tilted her head, blush coating her cheeks, aquamarine glinting with mischief. “If it makes you feel better I was also staring at your ass.”</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue against her cheek, grinning. “I’m sitting down.”</p><p>“So you should be flattered by my effort.”</p><p><i>Okay, she’s a spitfire</i>, Rio thought. “What about my fingers?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“What about my fingers made you decide I was a surgeon.”</p><p>She tutted her tongue against her teeth, sliding her free hand across the lacquered wood of the bar, her index finger barely brushing against the back of Rio’s hand.</p><p>“The way they moved.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Slow. Methodical. Attentive.”</p><p>“It’s a sticker off a beer bottle.”</p><p>“And yet every piece has been taken off in precise, uniform detail.” She pointed to the pieces of damp paper on the bar, all the same shape and size to a fault. “So it was either surgeon or serial killer.”</p><p>“I could be both.”</p><p>“Doubt it.”</p><p>“”Why’s that?”</p><p>“Your eyes are too kind.” She quipped, finger now idly tracing the back of Rio’s hand. “My guess is something with kids, right? You seem like the type of nerd to give them a dino toy when they’ve been brave.”</p><p>Rio blinked a few times, bewildered, because that’s <i>exactly</i> the type of nerd she was. “Do you work at the hospital?” Though she would kick herself if she had been in proximity to this gorgeous and interesting of a woman and never noticed.</p><p>The fucking siren in front of her snorted and Rio considered it one of the most beautiful sounds to ever grace her eardrums. “No, god no. I’m a teacher.”</p><p>“So you’re also the type of nerd that works with kids?”</p><p>“Technically, but I teach high school English.” Her smile only got wider. “I only come here to troll for hot, rich doctors.”</p><p>Rio sighed. “Then you picked the wrong one. I’m poor, embarrassingly so.”</p><p>“Who said I picked you?”</p><p>“So you just watched my hands and my ass for no reason?”</p><p>“Well you’re not loaded, so yeah, apparently.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “You’re quick.”</p><p>“No, I’m Agatha.” She let her finger drop to Rio’s wrist right over her pulse point. “And your name?”</p><p>“Why do you wanna know it?”</p><p>“It’s usually courtesy to have someone’s legal name before screaming it in bed,” She fully turned her body towards Rio’s. “But I can always just shout out random ones if you’d prefer. Like Dani or JJ,” She studied Rio for a bit longer, half guessing and half joking. “Ana?”</p><p>Rio’s face flushed, her chest felt warm. “You hit on all your women by calling them what I am assuming are your ex’s names?”</p><p>“Only the ones who make me work for it.” She raised a single eyebrow in a challenge.</p><p>“You don’t even know if I’m into women.”</p><p>“You’re looking awfully nervous for a straight girl.” Her stare raked over Rio’s body, studying her. “The tattoos on your arm and the Docs don’t help your case either.”</p><p>Rio had a sleeve on her arm, mostly vines with flowers woven throughout. It was Boston so most hospitals didn’t care if their doctors were tatted, and on the rare occasion where she had to cover them, she just wore a long sleeve under her scrub top or her white coat on top.</p><p>Yeah, also a reason she never had any fucking money.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>She swiveled her stool, her body now facing Agatha. “Rio.”</p><p>“De Janeiro…?”</p><p>“No, my name. It’s Rio.”</p><p>“Mmmmh.” She contently hummed, gaze locking in on hers. “Dr. Rio.”</p><p>“Dr. Vidal.” Rio corrected, “Pediatrics.”</p><p>“Knew it.” Agatha huffed, rolling her eyes. “Nerd.”</p><p>The confidence, the razzing, the way this woman carried herself–</p><p>Angels don’t exist, signs from the universe are lies people tell themselves, there is no magic number that someone can wish on and get everything they've ever wanted. Rio knew that, but looking at those two pools of pale blue, she almost wished she didn’t.</p><p>“Mrs. Agatha.” Rio shot back, grinning and taking a sip of her beer.</p><p>“<i>Miss</i> Harkness.” She emphasized the part of her name that let Rio know she wasn’t married. “But let’s not distract ourselves with formalities.”</p><p>“Oh? What should we distract ourselves with?”</p><p>Agatha suddenly stood, leaning down to whisper into her ear. “With the fact that I’m going to go to the bathroom, and maybe I forget to lock the door.”</p><p>She looked up at her, at the woman who looked like she was going to eat Rio whole, and gave a dazed nod. She watched as Agatha walked away, the sway of her hips, the swell of her ass in those fucking jeans.</p><p>A beat later, Rio got up, walking down the compact hallway and reaching the door to one of two bathrooms. Both single stall, both with lockable doors. It’s like they were asking people to fuck in them, that’s how Rio reasoned it anyway.</p><p>June 2nd, 2007, Rio met her wife. She didn’t realize it at the time, she didn’t get Agatha’s info after shoving those very methodical fingers into her jeans while the other woman moaned as she sat atop the sink. No, it wasn’t until a few weeks later, when Rio went back to that bar after another long shift, that Agatha waltzed in a few minutes after.</p><p>Lucky four leaf clovers and wish-granting shooting stars are made up ideas sold by con men, but Rio could live with that if it meant fate brought them both back to that shabby hole in the wall bar at the same time, on the same night. And yes, Rio got her number that time, taking her out on their first date the following week.</p><p>They got married on June 2nd, 2010.</p><p>They bought their home in 2011.</p><p>They had their daughter in 2012.</p><p>Yeah, the universe did not work in mysterious ways, Rio knew that as a medical professional. Nobody’s life is saved by a higher power, it’s saved by science and professional training.</p><p>However, she could overlook that for her wife and daughter, for the milestones. For the memories of a pregnant and miserable Agatha choosing a color scheme for the nursery and Rio building all the furniture. Their daughter being born happy and healthy at the same hospital Rio was now an attending at, the smiles and the tears as they held Nicky for the first time. Rio falling asleep with Nicky on her chest during late night feedings and diaper changes. Agatha helping her toddle over the hardwood floors of their townhome near downtown and take her first steps. Rio helping her to learn how to ride a bike with the residual ice and sleet of a late Boston spring. The birthdays, the anniversaries, the promotions and good grades.</p><p>Rio let herself believe in fate for that part of her life, foolishly apparently.</p><p>They finalized their divorce in 2022.</p><p>She remembers signing the paperwork, the ink spilling out the tip of the pen and ending her marriage in a broad stroke. Fifteen years together, twelve married, thirteen where they were happy, and one kid. And a dotted line just undid it all.</p><p>Agatha kept the townhouse, Rio got a nice loft near the hospital. They split custody of their daughter, who hated them and the back and forth, and Rio really couldn’t fault her for it. They alternated weeks and holidays, they were cordial enough. On the outside looking in, they were amicable. And even if it did kill Rio on the inside, Agatha told her they were done, so she respected her wishes.</p><p>They never truly felt over, even in the three years since the divorce, Rio still wore her wedding ring. She’d gone out on a few dates, but nothing compared in her mind, nobody ever would. And it made her feel pathetic, because while Rio pined from a distance, her ex wife (which she despised that ‘ex’ part of ‘wife’ with every fiber of her being) dated and went out and lived her life.</p><p>There had been a few steady girlfriends, all of which Rio wanted to violently murder but didn’t out of respect for Agatha and their child. The inbetween, the post-break up eras is where Rio thrived. 	Where she’d drop Nicky off at her former home and be able to look at Agatha and just <i>know</i> she’d get a call the second their daughter left to hangout with friends or for her tutoring gig. Where Rio would come over and pin her ex wife to the nearest wall, ruminate in the familiar taste of Agatha’s lips, cherish the feeling of Agatha’s soft skin beneath her hand, fucking memorize the sounds Agatha made as she came around Rio’s fingers or tongue or strap.</p><p>Fifteen years hadn’t been long enough, she needed more and Rio would take it however she could get it. Even if it meant only being a warm body for the meantime, even if it meant leaving at Agatha’s word so Nicky wouldn’t catch them and get confused.</p><p>And Rio understood, she didn’t blame Agatha for ending things, not after everything that happened. Things she couldn’t take back. She hoped that time would heal the wound, the one they both shared, the child they lost. But it didn’t, so Rio focused on the child they did have, she focused on her career despite the part it played in ending her marriage. She worked more and more hours when they were separated, before the custody arrangement had been finalized. Rio basically lived in that on-call room more than any other doctor in that fucking hospital.</p><p>Now, three years had passed since Rio signed that stupid fucking dotted line, and she was worse off. She had friends, though they were also Agatha’s, lesbians and their tight knit friends were a curse. She had hobbies, she had her garden, she had her daughter two weeks a month. But she didn’t have her wife– dammit, ex wife. Three years and she still made that mistake, still felt wrong when another woman hit on her, still recoiled at being touched in a way that only Agatha had done for fifteen years.</p><p>Her and Agatha were off currently, she hadn’t gotten a booty call in well over six months. Some ginger chick that Agatha had been seeing, according to Nicky the woman was nice enough, kind of pretty. Rio wanted to ply her daughter for more information but knew it’d get back to her ex if she did, so she left it alone and waited for Agatha to call.</p><p>Because she always did.</p><p>No matter how long it had been, or who she had just been with, Rio always came back when Agatha needed her. And not to pat herself on the shoulder, but Rio was pretty confident no other woman could fuck her wife like she could. Their sex life had vanished in their last couple years of marriage, but once those papers were filed, something clicked back again. Which, thank god because she had missed throwing her wife around like a rag doll and eating her out until her legs involuntarily shook. It wasn’t exactly the same as before. The sex was more detached and Agatha never let Rio see or feel her abdomen. She’d always wear some sort of shirt that’d never leave her body because she didn’t want Rio to look at or touch the angry scar on her lower stomach. Which Rio lived with. She had learned to live with a lot. So, Agatha could have her fun, because Rio never truly worried that another could take her ex.</p><p>Until their daughter’s 13th birthday party, held at that same fucking towhome. It was Saturday in early September, she came bearing cake as was her responsibility according to her ex. She still had a key so she let herself in, baggy blue jeans sitting low on her waist, a tight heather gray tank adorning her torso. Her hair was pulled back into a messy bun, having chopped it last month because at forty-five years old, she didn’t want to fucking deal with it anymore. And if her tattoos were on full display and she had forgone a bra, who would notice?</p><p>Agatha, hopefully.</p><p>She made her way through the house, Agatha had redecorated a few things over the years, but ultimately it was mainly the same. She made idle chitchat with their shared acquaintances before grabbing a beer and heading out to the deck, her daughter bounding up to her.</p><p>“Mami!”</p><p>Rio opened her arms as their bodies collided, smiling against the crown of her daughter’s head. “Hey, teddy.”</p><p>“I missed you.” Nicky spoke, squeezing Rio tight, face pressed into her shoulder.</p><p>Rio pulled back, looking down fractionally because Nicky had shot up over the summer like a fucking weed. “I missed you too, but you saw me Sunday.”</p><p>Monday to Sunday was their routine, tomorrow night Rio would pick Nicky up and take her back to the loft. Not perfect but it was the best they could do with what they had done to their life.</p><p>“Mom’s looking for you.”</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Rio didn’t ask why, her eyes fell to her daughter’s neck, her fingers plucking the dainty gold chain and accompanying stone. “¿Qué es esto?”</p><p>Nicky didn’t wear dainty, overly feminine jewelry. Wherever this came from, it didn’t scream her daughter’s vibe. Nicky still wore Rio’s old Paramore shirts, the one from their Riot or Brand New Eyes era, claiming they were “vintage”. Which yes, made Rio feel ancient. Nicky wore ripped jeans and thrifted band tees, not preppy princess bullshit. Not that it would be a bad thing if she did, they’d support Nicky no matter how she dressed. But Rio had to admit, her daughter was stupid fucking cool. It looked to be real gold with a sapphire pendent, Nicky’s birthstone. Her and Agatha had a general rule of not buying their kid expensive gifts since Rio heavily out earned her ex financially.</p><p>“Wanda me lo dio.” Nicky scoffed, rolling her huge brown doe eyes.</p><p>“Wanda?” She scrunched her face, “Who the fuck is–”</p><p>“Rio!” Alice’s voice called from where her and the rest of the gang sat in the backyard. “How the hell are you here? Thought you were in surgery?”</p><p>“And miss my daughter’s birthday? No fucking way.” Rio shouted across the way, a few guests turning their heads.</p><p>“Language, please.” Lilia, who for all intents and purposes was Agatha’s mom, scolded. “My grandchild is thirteen, not twenty.”</p><p>“I know the word ‘fuck’, nona.” Nicky called over to the table before looking back at Rio. “I think it quite a lot around <i>that woman</i>.”</p><p>“Nicola Camila Vidal...” Lilia warned.</p><p>Rio scrunched her face. “What woman?”</p><p>“Wanda!”</p><p>“Who is Wanda?!”</p><p>Her ex wife’s voice bellowed from behind her. “My girlfriend.”</p><p>Rio whipped around, and Agatha looked beautiful, she always did. She was carrying the cake, fingers bare of a wedding ring unlike Rio’s. She stood with an annoyed expression on her face, a simple blue sun dress on her frame. And yes, they were celebrating their daughter’s birthday, and yes, they were divorced. But if she still had Agatha, if she still had her perfect life, Rio’s head would currently be under that dress.</p><p>Instead of dropping to her knees on the deck that she fucking built herself in front of their friends, Rio swallowed and quirked her eyebrow. “Since when?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes the same way she did in that bar eighteen years ago. “Help me with the cake.” She hissed before turning around and heading back into the house and into the kitchen.</p><p>Rio followed, knowing damn well her ex did not need help with the cake, closing the sliding glass door behind her. The kitchen was empty as Agatha stood at the island, very aggressively sticking candles into the cake.</p><p>“I told you <i>months ago</i> I was dating someone.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, approaching the opposite side of the island. “I didn't think it was serious enough that she was giving my daughter presents.”</p><p>“You think I would bring a complete stranger around Nicky?”</p><p>“I just–” Rio sighed, setting her beer down on the counter. “I figured it’d fizzle out, it always does.”</p><p>Agatha peered up from her task like she was attempting to murder Rio with just a glare. “Thanks.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean it like that.” She explained, “I meant that neither of us has had a serious partner since…everything.”</p><p>“Well, I do.”</p><p>“So where is she?” Rio waved her arms around, challenging a non-existent woman. “I don’t see Big Red anywhere.”</p><p>Rio could only insult the woman so much with the very little info she had on her.</p><p>“Not here yet, we went out to dinner with Nicky last night because I don’t trust you to meet her.”</p><p>“Why’s that?”</p><p>“Because,” Agatha gripped onto the side of the counter, shoulders tensing. “I know that you’d probably try to scare her off.”</p><p>“That’s not true.”</p><p>It was.</p><p>“Rio, you don’t date. You don’t go out. You work and take care of Nicky.”</p><p>“How do you know that?”</p><p>“Our daughter isn’t stupid, she knows you’re lonely.” Agatha tilted her head. “And I didn’t think it’d be good for her if I rubbed salt in your wound. Maturity and all that bullshit.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t lonely, she was perfectly content beside the constant ache in her chest for her old life back.</p><p>“How long has this been going on?”</p><p>“Nicky’s worrying or Wanda?”</p><p>“Wanda. Nicky doesn’t need to worry about me, I’m fine.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look convinced at that last part, but she answered anyway. “Nine months, almost ten?”</p><p>“Nine?” Rio cocked her head, “No, because it was a few days after Valentine’s day when you called me and we–”</p><p>“I know.” She interrupted, not wanting to rehash the night they spent fucking a few days after Valentine’s of all holidays. “We weren’t exclusive then.”</p><p>“That’s so funny,” Rio smirked, deciding to pick at the issue until it was raw. “‘Cause I distinctly remember you saying something along the lines of me being the best you’ve ever had while you were sitting on my face. And come to find out, you had another woman on the side.”</p><p>“She wasn’t on the side!” Agatha snapped. “You were! It was a moment of weakness that, believe me, will not happen again.”</p><p>Her gut twisted at being the other woman to Agatha, the placeholder.</p><p>“Oh, I’ve heard that one before.” She bitterly chuckled. “What makes this time so different?”</p><p>“It’s serious, it’s- it’s more.” Agatha looked directly into her eyes as she verbally slit Rio's throat. “We talk about marriage, about the future.”</p><p>Goal achieved because Rio’s windpipe constricted, her wife never failing to say the exact right thing to break Rio down into pieces that she’d promptly stomp on. “Marriage?”</p><p>“Yup.” Agatha sighed.</p><p>“You’d get remarried?”</p><p>“Maybe.” She shrugged noncommittally. “If she asked.”</p><p>“Then I want to meet her.”</p><p>“Rio–”</p><p>“You’re telling me this woman could be another parent to my kid and I don’t deserve to meet her?!” Rio nearly shouted, and though it appeared as rage, it was nothing more than anguish.</p><p>Agatha gently shook her head, giving up. “She’ll be here in an hour. But you have to promise me to behave yourself.”</p><p>“What do you think I’ll do?”</p><p>“Hit her?” Agatha almost grinned, “Mark your territory and intimidate her?”</p><p>“It’s my wife and kid we’re talking about–”</p><p>“Ex.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, a certain pain lingering behind the aqua. “Ex wife, Rio. I’m your ex wife, you're my ex wife.”</p><p>“I said that.”</p><p>“No,” She blew out a tired breath. “You didn’t.”</p><p>“Does Wanda know we had sex while you two were together?”</p><p>“No, and she doesn’t need to.” Agatha picked up a lighter, setting the wicks of the candles aflame. “Last thing I need is her thinking you still have a shot with me.”</p><p>Her eyes went glassy, quickly blinking back the tears. “Right.”</p><p>“Let’s just focus on Nicky today, hm? Soon she’ll be a full fledged teenager who hates and resents us.”</p><p>“She already resents us.”</p><p>“Builds character.” Agatha huffed, picking up the cake again and making her way back to the door. “Can you open the door?”</p><p>Rio walked over, body next to Agatha’s as she undid the latch of the handle. “The track needs some WD-40, it’s sticking.”</p><p>“I’ll buy some.”</p><p>Rio tugged, the door barely moving. “I can bring some over when I pick up Nicky tomorrow.” She angled her body, stepping into Agatha’s personal space as her ex lifted the cake out of Rio’s way. “It’s just–”</p><p>“Sticking, I know.”</p><p>Rio looked up from the handle and was unaware until that current moment just <i>how</i> close they were. Her face a breath away from Agatha’s. “I can, um, I can fix it…tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha’s pupils dilated and Rio could hear her swallow before speaking. “So you’ve said.”</p><p>The door was glass, so everyone outside could currently see them, but it wasn’t like they were doing anything inappropriate. It’s not like Rio was leaning in further and Agatha was letting her, or that the amount of eye contact being shared was completely unnecessary…</p><p>No, of course not.</p><p>Rio half-heartedly pulled again, barely using any strength as her gaze stayed on her wife. “I think we’re trapped.”</p><p>“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” Agatha smirked.</p><p>“I–”</p><p>A set of footsteps entered the room, a casual voice following. “What’s going on here?”</p><p>They both whipped their heads over, Agatha taking a few steps back. “Wanda.”</p><p>The woman wasn’t kind of pretty like Nicky said, she was gorgeous.</p><p>And the complete opposite of Rio.</p><p>Where Rio opted for masculine clothing, hard lines and dark colors, Wanda went the other way. She stood in the foyer with her red hair down and curled, not an eyelash out of fucking place. She had on a pair of jeans that looked to be vintage, white linen blouse and heeled boots to finish the ensemble. Rio buffered as she stared at the woman, suddenly the pretty princess bullshit Nicky was currently wearing made sense.</p><p>Wanda smiled, setting her designer handbag down on the counter as she walked over to them.</p><p>“I- I thought you weren’t coming until later.” Agatha stumbled over her words.</p><p>“My meeting got done early, thought I’d surprise you and the birthday girl.”</p><p>Yeah, her daughter had mentioned Wanda was some marketing executive or something. That made Rio seethe because Wanda couldn’t have been more than thirty-five, and here she was, wildly successful.</p><p>“Hon, this is Rio.” Agatha tilted her head towards Rio, “My ex.”</p><p>Wanda extended her hand, long acrylics perfectly manicured, her tone cheery. “I’ve heard so much about you from Nic, it’s good to finally cross paths.”</p><p>
<i>Nic?</i>
</p><p>Oh, this fucking bitch.</p><p>Rio kept her grip on the handle, giving a disingenuous smile. “You too, kinda have my hands full.”</p><p>“Do you want me to try?” Wanda offered.</p><p>As if Rio would let her, using the rage she had currently bubbling inside her body, Rio yanked the damn thing again with all her strength. Finally, it budged, sliding down the track.</p><p>Rio bit back a snide laugh, giving them both one last glance before heading back out onto the deck.</p><p>“I got it. Thanks.”</p><p>Motherfucking ginger cockblock.</p>

<p>The rest of Nicky’s party went fine. They sang Happy Birthday and had cake, Nicky opened presents, Rio kept her mouth shut. Agatha really only cared that Nicky had a good time, so long as her child was happy. The party wrapped up, leaving Wanda, Nicky, Rio, Lilia, and herself.</p><p>Agatha began cleaning up, Rio and Wanda helping and actively avoiding one another at all costs. Nicky was with Lilia in the kitchen starting dinner, her daughter’s one request was to have her nona cook her famous Busiate alla Trapanese. Agatha wasn’t much of a cook, never had been. She had a few dishes she could do well and rotated them often, Rio was the chef between the two of them and her daughter never let her forget that fact. Especially when they had first separated and Nicky would complain about how much she missed her mami’s cooking.</p><p>So Agatha obviously agreed to a family dinner when Nicky had asked, except–</p><p>“Can mami stay for dinner?” Nicky asked as she stood next to Lilia by the stove, weaponizing those damn puppydog eyes she got from Rio.</p><p>“Teddy, I don’t know if she can stay–” Agatha said, tossing paper plates into the trash.</p><p>“I can stay.” Rio spoke, coming in from the deck with a garbage bag full of wrapping paper.</p><p>“There might not be enough food,” Agatha flitted her eyes over to her mom, screaming silently for help. “Right, ma?”</p><p>Lilia looked at her, knowing exactly what she was trying to do and smiling. “I’m Sicilian, of course there's enough food.” She then looked at Agatha’s ex. “I don’t see you nearly as much as I’d like to anymore, stay.”</p><p>Her ex grinned victoriously. “You’re too kind, Lilia.”</p><p>“Okay, I think that’s all the streamers.” Wanda announced as she stepped inside, hands full of colorful paper. “No sea turtles choking on my watch.”</p><p>“I wish <i>you</i> would.” Nicky muttered under her breath, causing Lilia to lightly elbow her.</p><p>“Nicola.” Lilia whispered in a warning.</p><p>“What?” She shrugged, stirring whatever her nona had told her to.</p><p>“Um, Rio’s going to stay for dinner.” Agatha looked at her girlfriend, who was trying and failing so miserably to fit in.</p><p>Wanda discarded the streamers, giving a diplomatic smile. “Great.”</p><p>Rio seemed to be annoyed at the very thought of Wanda breathing, looking at Agatha. “You got any wine?”</p><p>Oh right, alcohol!</p><p>Invented for situations just like this one.</p><p>“Yes, thank fucking god.” Agatha mumbled, bolting to the fridge and grabbing a bottle. “How many glasses?”</p><p>Yeah, every adult in the room agreed to wine.</p><p>No surprise there.</p><p>Lilia and Nicky finished cooking while Agatha, Wanda, and Rio all retired to the dining room. Wanda set her glass on the table and sat down, Agatha placing down her own reaching for the chair next to her girlfriend. As she did so, a hand shot out, pulling out the chair for her. Agatha paused, licking her lower lip as she looked at Rio who simply just stood waiting.</p><p>“Old habits.” Rio chirped.</p><p>Yeah, Rio always did shit like that. Held the door open, used her own jacket as a makeshift umbrella for Agatha whenever it rained, pulled out the chair for her at the table. Yes, Agatha had married a gentleman once upon a time, and Rio would never let her fucking forget it.</p><p>Agatha glared, but sat down as Rio pushed in the chair for her. “Thanks.”</p><p>Rio took the chair opposite Agatha, gingerly sipping her drink, copper eyes flitting between the two. “So how’d you guys meet?”</p><p>Wanda perked up. “Oh, uh at a bar actually. New Year’s eve.”</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue against the side of her cheek, a mannerism that their daughter inherited. “No way, us too.” She waved her finger between herself and Agatha.</p><p>“Yeah,” Wanda nodded, “She just saw me and went for it. Very brazenly, I might add.”</p><p>“Ahhh,” Her ex agreed, “She’s brazen, this one.”</p><p>And Agatha knew what Rio was doing, trying to get under her skin. Making polite conversation with her girlfriend who Agatha was aware Rio already despised. She knew her ex’s tones like the back of her fucking hand, and this one was the fakest in her repertoire.</p><p>“Anyway…” Agatha said, attempting to shift the conversation.</p><p>“Did she pull the bathroom move?” Rio raised her eyebrows.</p><p>“Fucks sake.” She hissed, staring daggers at her ex wife across the table. “Could you not?”</p><p>“Bathroom move?” Wanda echoed.</p><p>“Ya know, maybe she goes to the bathroom and ‘forgets’ to lock the door.” Rio explained, wine in one hand. Sure, she’d had one beer during the party, but Rio wasn’t a lightweight, she wasn’t drunk or even tipsy. She was just being a dick. “I lost track of  the amount of times she did that while we were married. It’s a miracle we’re not banned from most public places in Boston.”</p><p>“Um, no…?” Wanda responded, she turned her head to Agatha in confusion. “Am I missing something?”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio widened her eyes dramatically. “You’re missing <i>a lot</i>.”</p><p>“That’s enough.” Agatha declared, “And not helpful.”</p><p>Rio didn’t need to know the details of how Agatha and Wanda came to be, or when they fucked, or how they fucked. It wasn’t her place, and Agatha would remind her of that every chance she got.</p><p>Sure, her and Wanda’s sex life wasn’t as great as her and Rio’s is–</p><p>Was.</p><p>But it didn’t mean it was bad, it was fine.</p><p>“Did you two spend Valentine’s together?” Rio continued, taking another sip.</p><p>Agatha felt her blood pressure skyrocket, the silent insinuation dangling between the three of them.</p><p>“Yeah,” Wanda said, “We went to Yvonne’s over on Winter Ave.”</p><p>“Swanky.” Rio nodded, “Good food?”</p><p>“Oh my god, it was delicious.” Wanda replied, trying to engage in a seemingly safe topic of conversation. “We were both stuffed afterwards.”</p><p>“Something tells me Agatha wasn’t….” Rio muttered against the rim of her glass.</p><p>“Hmm?” Wanda furrowed her brows, not having caught it.</p><p>But Agatha did.</p><p>“Rio, kitchen.” Agatha barked, standing up from the table. “Now.”</p><p>Rio pursed her lips, beginning to get up. “Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>As soon as she was in close enough range, Agatha grabbed her by the wrist and yanked her out of the room. She completely bypassed the kitchen where her mom and daughter were, instead shoving her into the bathroom off the den.</p><p>She locked the door, whipping around to face her ex. “What the fuck is your problem?!”</p><p>Rio pointed at the lock. “Look at that, you remembered this time!”</p><p>“Can you just not be a total asshole for one evening?”</p><p>“I thought I was being nice.”</p><p>“You were antagonizing her.”</p><p>“Not my fault she’s too dumb to recognize that.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath before lashing out and strangling Rio, mostly because she knew her ex would fucking love it if she did.</p><p>“For our daughter’s sake, can you please just play nice?”</p><p>“Our daughter’s sake? Nicky doesn’t like her either!”</p><p>“And she never will if you keep trying to start a pissing contest!”</p><p>“Please, like ginger spice could compete…”</p><p>“See! Shit like that is not going to foster a good relationship between the two of them.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “Oh no.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha took a step closer. “We are over. I know that’s hard for you to comprehend but I am not a prize to be won or an object to be owned. We are both free to do whatever we want with whoever we want.”</p><p>“And you want <i>her?</i>”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Wanda was sweet, caring, and funny enough. She was intelligent enough that Agatha wouldn’t get bored, she had a good job, she put in effort with Nicky. On paper, Wanda was perfect. And most importantly, <i>not</i> Rio.</p><p>“Just answer me one thing, and I’ll drop it.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, far from convinced she would drop anything. “What?”</p><p>Rio licked her bottom lip before her lips curled up into a sinister smile. “When did you become a top?”</p><p>She reared her head back as though she had been punched square in the face. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“I saw her nails.”</p><p>“Plenty of queer women have long nails.”</p><p>“Yeah, but like, <i>all</i> of her nails were long…”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“So, if my memory serves me correctly you’re a taker.” Rio pointed past her, referring to the woman currently waiting at the table. “And she sure as shit is not a giver.”</p><p>Yeah, because Agatha didn’t feel comfortable being that vulnerable with anyone but her ex. Despite the fact that she was hellbent on her and Rio never fucking again, Agatha knew she’d never have that trust with someone else. Because Rio took care of Agatha in a way that another person couldn’t. Some connection, some bond that no matter how hard she tried, never broke.</p><p>“Maybe you don’t know me as well anymore.”</p><p>Rio didn’t even blink, just chuckled. “Baby, we both know that’s a lie.”</p><p>She ignored her heart skipping a beat at the pet name, keeping her face neutral. This was so much easier when she could just get her way by batting her eyelashes or flashing her tits and making Rio’s brain go blank.</p><p>But that was no longer an option, so words it was.</p><p>“Just be civil, just for today. That’s all I’m asking.”</p><p>“I haven’t hit her, have I?”</p><p>“Yes, but it’s very clear you’d like to.”</p><p>“Sue me.”</p><p>“I did.” Agatha smiled knowingly. “Took half of everything you own.”</p><p>Not that it had been difficult. Throughout the entire process of their divorce, Rio had responded to every negotiation with “Give her whatever she wants.”</p><p>Not that Agatha wanted a lot, she didn’t marry Rio for her money or lack thereof when they first met. Hell, Agatha had even refused spousal support. The only money she actually received was monthly child support and that was because she made peanuts compared to her ex. The public education system, may god bless it, did not pay its teachers well. Barely enough to live, actually.</p><p>“You could’ve kept everything I own.” Rio said quietly. “Could’ve kept me.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath constricted in her ribcage, acting as a ribbon caught on bone. “I didn’t act alone.”</p><p>Rio’s face fell at the accusation, because even if Agatha was the one to serve Rio the papers, there were two people at fault for the end of their marriage. Not that their daughter saw it that way, however. No, Nicky resolutely saw Agatha as the one who broke up the family and Rio as the victim. It’s why she worried so much, it’s why she hated Wanda, it’s why she had distanced herself from Agatha ever since the divorce. And yeah, it had crushed her to lose one child physically and another emotionally in the span of a couple of years. But she told Rio they were done, and her ex just…listened.</p><p>So now they stood in front of one another, in the bathroom of their once shared home, fighting. Fighting about Wanda and petty shit because this was their reality now. But Agatha wouldn’t go back, she couldn’t.</p><p>“I know.” Rio’s voice was gentle. “I know.”</p><p>“Then don’t blame me when you fucking know.” Agatha bit out, refusing to let tears well. “I get enough of that from my mom and our daughter.”</p><p>“Lilia?”</p><p>She definitely wasn’t fucking referring to Evanora.</p><p>“Please, do you think I ever heard the end of it with her?” She bit her trembling lip. “Everyone pities you and hates me. I don’t need you making this any harder than it already is.”</p><p>“Lilia and Nicky don’t hate you. They would never.”</p><p>“You know Nicky doesn’t even hug me anymore?” Agatha’s voice broke. “She doesn’t look at me the same way. You’re her hero and I’m the villain.”</p><p>When Nicky had just ran up to Rio today the minute she saw her? It cut. It fucking bruised. To see her daughter overcome with so much relief and joy at the sight of her ex, only to sigh and scoff around her. To know that she blamed Agatha for everything wrong in her life and see her as evil, when she had worked so fucking hard to ensure her daughter would see her as anything but. Especially after what her own mother put her through, especially after her own childhood.</p><p>“Agatha–” Rio’s eyes went soft with sympathy.</p><p>Wanda never looked at her like that, and she was so fucking grateful for it. It was easy with Wanda, no baggage or painful past. When Wanda looked at Agatha, she saw <i>Agatha.</i> When Rio looked at Agatha, Rio saw the past eighteen years. And though most of it had been fucking amazing, the bad parts just hurt too much.</p><p>She sniffled, uninterested in receiving Rio’s comfort. “So, please. Just be fucking cordial.”</p><p>Rio nodded, surrendering the fight. “Okay.”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha breathed out, turning and opening the door. She hastily wiped her eyes, ignoring the pain in her chest. She stopped in the kitchen when Lilia announced dinner was ready, offering to carry one of the many dishes to the table.</p><p>Rio followed behind with plates and cutlery, Lilia and Nicky in tow with the last of the food. Once everyone was seated and the meal was laid out, the conversation flowed well enough. Lilia asked Nicky about summer camp, Rio and Agatha talked about work.</p><p>“Eighth grade good so far, teddy?” Rio grinned at their daughter who had opted to sit next to her.</p><p>“My English teacher is a moron, but besides that…”</p><p>“Well, that’s because we raised you to be pretentious about literature.” Agatha snorted. “Probably my fault.”</p><p>“Isn’t it always.” Nicky looked down at her plate, absently pushing the pasta around.</p><p>Having a teenage daughter was <i>so fun</i>.</p><p>“Mija.” Rio’s voice went serious, but not unkind. “Apologize.”</p><p>Her daughter rolled her eyes, briefly peeking up at Agatha. “Sorry, mom.”</p><p>“You can do better than that.” Rio spoke, “Like you mean it.”</p><p>Nicky fully looked up, eyes on Agatha. “I’m sorry for saying that, mom. It was disrespectful."</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha said, moving on for now. “What don’t you like about your English teacher?”</p><p>“The assigned reading is all men, and I know he was able to make it himself because it’s not dictated by the curriculum! He just chose all men!”</p><p>“Did you ask him about it?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Of course I did.”</p><p>“And what’d he say?” Rio prompted.</p><p>“That I can read whatever I’d like in my spare time, but as far as he’s concerned, the list isn’t changing.”</p><p>“Oh, so he is a prick.” Agatha set down her fork. “Great call on that one, teddy.”</p><p>“What’s teddy?” Her girlfriend’s voice broke through. Oh fuck, that’s right. Wanda was here. “You guys use it so often but I’m not actually sure what it means.”</p><p>Rio smiled, nostalgia washing over. “Uh, when Nicky was little, she was a clinger.”</p><p>Agatha’s own smile matched her ex’s. “She used to get so tired after running around that when you picked her up, she’d snuggle one of us immediately. Her chubby little hands would grab our hair and she’d tuck her face against our necks. She’d just burrow like–”</p><p>“A teddy bear.” Rio finished, eyes misting. “The name just stuck.”</p><p>“One time, she fell asleep while Rio was giving her a piggyback ride to the car.” Agatha lightly chuckled. “We kept bickering over where we had parked.”</p><p>“I thought it was row B, Agatha thought it was row F.” Rio supplied.</p><p>“Turns out, it was row D.” Nicky added, “And it was Disneyland, that was a big day for five year old me.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips at the memory of that vacation. “You looked so cute in your mouse ears meeting Captain Hook.”</p><p>“Captain Hook?” Wanda giggled. “Not Tinkerbell or Cinderella?”</p><p>“I don’t care much for bimbos.” Nicky snarked, mean-mugging Wanda. “Fictious or real.”</p><p>“Who the hell taught you the word bimbo?” Lilia gawked.</p><p>“Bigger issue, ma.” Agatha held up her hand to dismiss her mom. “Don’t say that to people, especially women, and especially not to Wanda.”</p><p>At that, Nicky groaned, standing from the table. “All I wanted was a <i>family</i> dinner!” She then pointed at Wanda. “She’s not family.” Nicky finished her outburst by fisting a hand around the chain of the necklace that Wanda had gifted her, and tugging. The chain broke free from her neck before she carelessly dropped it onto the table.</p><p>“Nicky–” Agatha stood.</p><p>“Mija–” Rio stood too.</p><p>“Don’t bother.” Their daughter huffed, turning on her heel. “I’m already going.”</p><p>The clunky boots Nicky always wore stomped off and up the stairs, the finale being the slamming of her bedroom door.</p><p>The silence following could've been sliced with a fucking machete, nobody saying a word. Rio’s copper locked onto Agatha, an understanding passing between the two of them. Agatha quickly ducked down to Wanda, “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“Should I go?” Wanda asked like she had done something wrong.</p><p>“No, we’ll handle it.”</p><p>“Be right back.” Rio started off towards the stairs.</p><p>Agatha gave Wanda a chaste kiss of reassurance, her ex’s eyes lingering on the interaction. She then began to follow Rio out of the dining room, her mom calling a quick “Good luck.” as they left.</p><p>They made their way down the hall, family photos still hung up on the walls. She noticed as Rio stopped for a moment at the door to what used to be their room. Now, Agatha slept in it alone. It was open and Rio usually never came up here, her curiosity getting the better of her.</p><p>Agatha had repainted the walls, switching the sage green for a darker hunter  green. The duvet, once earth toned botanicals, was now black and white pinestripes. The area rug and end tables had been swapped out too. Now, taking it in through Rio’s eyes, the room looked…colder? More impersonal. Like whoever used to sleep in this room died, the new occupant simply using it as a place to exist rather than live.</p><p>Which wasn’t far off, if Agatha were to be honest with herself.</p><p>“It’s…different.” Rio stated, taking a couple of steps into the space.</p><p>“Needed a change of pace.” Agatha spoke, waiting in the doorway.</p><p>Her ex’s jaw tensed, fighting back a comment or perhaps an emotion. “I get it.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Rio’s hands fell to the dresser, picking up a picture frame that sat on top. It was the three of them on Nicky’s 7th birthday, the last one before everything broke down. When things were good. Agatha came up next to her ex wife, peering down at the photo. If she really looked, she could see herself just starting to show. The slightest swell of her stomach as Nicky smiled over her cake, Rio lifting her up to help blow out the candles as Agatha watched on fondly.</p><p>“That was a good day.” Agatha said, “I think that’s the year we got her the Build-A-Bear you can write on and then wash.”</p><p>“She fucking loved that thing.” Her ex spoke, face contorting like it hurt to recall such an item. “That poor bear had so many Spanish cuss words on it.”</p><p>“You’re the one who taught her ‘perra’.”</p><p>“It’s a female dog!”</p><p>Agatha took the frame from Rio and set it back down. “One of the few photos we got with the whole family.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio shoved her hands in her pockets, uncomfortable at the explicit mention of their second child.</p><p>The child they never truly talked about.</p><p>“We should go check on Nicky.” She offered, pushing down the anger at her ex wife’s refusal to acknowledge their youngest kid. The kid that Agatha spent nine months making, the kid that didn’t get to take a breath or cry or even blink.</p><p>Agatha could unleash the fury she felt in that moment, or she could focus on the child that needed her. She left the room, hearing the soft steps of Rio following. Agatha stopped at Nicky’s door, closed of course. She lifted her hand and gently knocked. “Sweetheart?”</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Rio knocked then, her voice cutting in. “Mija?”</p><p>At the sound of her mami’s voice, Nicky opened the door. She had her backpack slung over her shoulder, headphones on her neck, and her laptop in hand.</p><p>“I wanna stay at mami’s tonight.”</p><p>Agatha blinked a few times in confusion. “What?”</p><p>“I wanna stay with mami.” Nicky repeated. “She was gonna pick me up tomorrow anyway.”</p><p>“That’s not the arrangement, hon.” Agatha said, tone close to guilty.</p><p>“If only there wasn’t one!” Their daughter snapped. “If you hadn’t kicked mami out then you wouldn’t have to worry about this.”</p><p>“Hey.” Rio interjected. “I know you’re upset and you’re not wrong for how you feel. But your mom hasn’t done anything wrong and you’re being hurtful.”</p><p>No matter how bad things got, they were a united front when it came to Nicky. Their daughter was not a bargaining chip or a way to get the upper hand, she was their kid who they loved. She was a person.</p><p>“She’s inviting her fucking girlfriend to family dinners and expecting me to act like everything's fine.” Nicky ranted. “It’s not fine. <i>We’re not fine</i>!”</p><p>“Language.” Rio said in a way that mimicked Lilia. “We use swear words casually, not to insult people.”</p><p>“Teddy–” Agatha started.</p><p>“Don’t.” Nicky replied, voice like venom. “I’m old enough to decide where I want to be, and right now, it’s not here.”</p><p>A bullet would have been easier to take.</p><p>Rio sighed, “Nicky…”</p><p>“It’s fine.” Agatha rasped, her throat feeling tight. “She can go with you. It’s okay.”</p><p>Her ex cocked her head. “Really?”</p><p>Keeping her here wasn’t going to help, she needed to rebel and Agatha would rather her do it safely. She’d always be safe with Rio. And after Evanora, Agatha wanted her daughter to feel as though she had autonomy over herself, that her voice was heard.</p><p>Agatha looked at her daughter. “You need time to cool off, I get it. This will not be a regular thing, but one night won’t be the end of the world.”</p><p>Nicky nodded, a microscopic smile etching her features. “Thank you.”</p><p>“But you are apologizing to Wanda as you leave.” Agatha firmly stated. “And I’m sure your mami agrees with me.”</p><p>Their daughter looked at Rio, obviously expecting her not to agree. However, Rio knew better than to go against Agatha’s parenting. “I think that’s a great idea.”</p><p>Nicky’s jaw dropped. “What?”</p><p>“You want to sleep at my place tonight, then you’re apologizing.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes–</p><p>Again with fucking eyerolling, did she get that from Agatha?</p><p>Did Agatha really roll her eyes that often?</p><p>“Fine, I’ll apologize to el diabla.”</p><p>Agatha let out a small breath. “Maybe a good start would be not calling her the devil.”</p><p>“It’s how I feel. I thought my feelings were valid.” Nicky quipped, smirking at the work around.</p><p>“Okay.” Rio clapped her hands together. “Let’s hit the road, shall we?”</p><p>They all trudged downstairs, briefly stopping in the dining room so Nicky could apologize, which she did. Wanda was a good sport, accepting it with a light-hearted chuckle and offering to get the chain of the necklace repaired. Nicky didn’t seem enthusiastic about that prospect but didn’t lash out either.</p><p>Agatha walked them to the door, saying her goodbyes. She outstretched her arms in the faintest hope her daughter might actually take her up on a hug. “Happy birthday. I love you, hon.”</p><p>Her daughter just pulled her headphones on, ignoring her plea for contact and saying a single “Love you.” before stepping outside and down the pathway to the street where Rio had parked.</p><p>Again, she’d rather take a bullet.</p><p>She loathed when her daughter did that. Negate the ‘I’ part of ‘I love you’. It was on purpose. It was said out of obligation, not genuine emotion.</p><p>“Told you.” Agatha glared at her ex and let her arms drop.</p><p>“I can hug you, if that’ll make you feel better.”</p><p>No physical contact was the safest option. Less probability of a fuck-up occurring.</p><p>“It won’t.”</p><p>It would.</p><p>“Fair enough.” Rio fished her key out of her pocket, forearm flexing.</p><p>Yeah, Agatha noticed shit like that. The tattoos on full display, the lack of bra, the way her fucking muscles moved. She should feel guilty, but they didn’t divorce because either of them were unattractive. After all, Agatha had eyes.</p><p>“I’ll bring the WD-40 over tomorrow.” Rio said, halfway out the door.</p><p>“You’re still gonna do that?”</p><p>“Of course I am. I won’t sleep well knowing something’s wrong. Have a good night, Agatha.”</p><p>She closed the door, letting herself slump against it for a moment.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t remember the last time she slept well.</p><p>“I should probably head out too,” Wanda said, grabbing her bag. “Feels like you need a minute.”</p><p>Agatha crinkled her brows. “I need years.”</p><p>Wanda smiled, “She’s thirteen, she’ll get over it.”</p><p>“Maybe I rushed things–”</p><p>“Babe, you waited seven months before you even introduced us.” Wanda placed a delicate hand on her wrist, reassuring her. “She just needs time. God knows I was horrible at her age too.”</p><p>Nicky wasn’t horrible, she was confident and sure of who she was. Agatha wasn’t raised in a home where she could be loud, or speak her mind. Even if it did come out in less than ideal ways, she was proud Nicky was able to stand up for herself. But explaining all that was too much, so she settled on the safer response.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“I had thicker eyeliner, but the sentiment was the same. Mad at the world, angry at my mom.”</p><p>“You were emo?”</p><p>“Hot Topic got so much of my money.” She chuckled before leaning in and kissing her goodbye. “I’ll get the necklace fixed but I won’t pressure her to wear it.”</p><p>“You’re nice.” Agatha grinned. “I’m sorry for everything tonight.”</p><p>“Like I said, I get it.” Wanda kissed one more time before opening the door. “Dinner? Monday night?”</p><p>“Sounds good.”</p><p>“Night, babe. I love you.”</p><p>“Love you.” Agatha said as she closed the door behind her girlfriend.</p><p>See? Perfect on paper.</p><p>Yeah, Agatha wouldn’t be sleeping well tonight.</p><hr/><p>The drive home was silent, Rio periodically looking over to her daughter in the passenger's seat. Her headphones were blasting some angsty teen music, her head turned to look out the window.</p><p>When they got home, Nicky stalked off towards her bedroom. And Rio probably should’ve left it alone, but that ache that never left her chest began to pulse. She followed after her daughter, finding Nicky already slumped on the bed.</p><p>“Hey.” Rio tapped her ear to signal that Nicky needed to take off the headphones.</p><p>She did so, furrowing her brows in the same obtuse way Agatha always had. “What?”</p><p>“Could you be a little bit more chill?”</p><p>“I am chill.”</p><p>Rio nearly keeled over in astonishment. “You, daughter of mine, are anything but chill.”</p><p>“I thought I reacted appropriately given the circumstances…”</p><p>“You called Wanda a bimbo.”</p><p>“<i>Tehcnically,</i> I implied she was a bimbo. Not my fault if everyone at the table immediately agreed that she was the bimbo in question.”</p><p>“Stop saying that word.”</p><p>“I learned it from you!”</p><p>“Yeah, because I didn’t realize you were within earshot when I was ranting to your aunt Alice on the phone!”</p><p>“Again, not my fault.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath. “Listen, I know this sucks–”</p><p>“It sure fucking does.”</p><p>“<i>But</i>,” Rio kept speaking, “I need you to be nicer to your mom.”</p><p>“I’m plenty nice.”</p><p>“You could improve.”</p><p>“I went out to dinner with her and Wanda last night, I wore that fugly necklace today.” Nicky sat up. “What else does she want from me?”</p><p>Rio sat down next to her. “Maybe a hug…?”</p><p>Nicky averted her gaze. “Hugs are meant to show affection. I don’t feel particularly affectionate towards her.”</p><p>“Okay, but she did literally use her own body to create yours,” Rio raised her brows, sucking some air through her teeth. “So find it within yourself to cut her some slack.”</p><p>“I don’t know why you’re always defending her. She left you.”</p><p>Thank you to her child for reminding Rio of that.</p><p>“No, she didn’t. She asked me to leave and I did.” Rio brought her hand up to card through her daughter's hair.</p><p>“Why did you?”</p><p>“Oh, mi vida.” Rio ignored her own wound to nurse her daughter’s. “Sometimes things happen, and it’s hard to fix them.”</p><p>“You’d think losing Alex would’ve brought you guys closer.”</p><p>Fuck, if that name didn’t want to make her crumble on the spot.</p><p>“Doesn’t always work out that way.”</p><p>“I don’t like her. I’m never going to.” Nicky said, referring back to Wanda.</p><p>“You don’t have to, but you have to ease up on your mom. She loves you just as much as I do.”</p><p>“Fine.” Her daughter grumbled, “But I want a real family dinner, no outsiders or bimbos.”</p><p>“‘I’ll call your mom tomorrow and see what we can do. Fair?”</p><p>“Fair.”</p><p>“Good.” Rio got up, walking towards the door. “I love you, teddy.”</p><p>“I love you too, mami.”</p>

<p>Agatha was sprawled out in bed, hair splayed against the pillow, sweat beading in her hairline. Agatha’s back arched closer to her mouth. “<i>Rio! Fuck!</i>” She groaned, one hand clutching the headboard and steadily creeping closer to her third orgasm.</p><p>The room was quiet, soft light filtering through the blinds and projecting onto the bed. Gentle sun peeking through, an outside world that had long since been discarded by the pair. Clothes littered the floor, torn off without a thought and leaving them both naked.</p><p>Rio was <i>thriving</i>. Four of her fingers working inside her love, tongue pressed against her clit. She’d buried herself here if it were allowed. Agatha’s thighs shaking around her head, her fingers tangled in Rio’s hair, urging her on. The subtle creaking of the bedframe being the only sound other than Agatha’s curses.</p><p>“Missed this.” Rio husked in between licks, “Missed you so, <i>so fucking much</i>, mi vida.”</p><p>“Missed you too, been too long.” Agatha moaned, veins of her neck straining against the skin. “I’m close.”</p><p>A wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon.</p><p>
<b>It was November, 2009.</b>
</p><p>And for the record, it had only been seventy-two hours.</p><p>Rio had pulled a double at the hospital, disappearing nearly all weekend before coming back to her place and crashing. She fed herself, showered, and knocked the fuck out for several hours. She rented a shitty and rundown house with Alice, and had since they were interns. Jen moved in last year, followed by Agatha moving in about four months ago.</p><p>Her girlfriend had been home all weekend, hanging out with (or terrorizing) Jen or grading papers. She’d let Rio sleep in before waking her up by making her come on her tongue, Rio roused and immediately rolled them over.</p><p>Which is how they got here, fucking all afternoon and ignoring anything else. Over two years together and it was still the honeymoon stage. Well, kind of. Sure, they budgeted groceries and had both held each other’s hair back when they were sick and puking, but that’s love. It was a kind of love that Rio wanted forever.</p><p>“Baby, jesus fuck!” Agatha cried, slamming her legs shut as she came and involuntarily crushing Rio’s head like a grape.</p><p>There was no better feeling than those thighs threatening to decapitate her, Rio could fucking bet on it. She kept going until the aftershocks subsided, slowly pulling out her fingers, now glistening with remnants of her girlfriend’s orgasm. Rio popped them in her mouth, moaning at the taste.</p><p>“Mi amor, Jen and Alice are going to hear you.”</p><p>“Jen and Alice spent all of Saturday fucking like bunnies, be grateful you weren’t home to listen to any of it.”</p><p>Rio made the crawl up Agatha’s body, leaving lingering kisses on her bush, and stomach, and tits, and neck, and cheek, before arriving at her lips. The kiss was simple but filled with affection, a content hum leaving Agatha’s throat. Rio could feel the smile Agatha was biting back as Rio’s tongue licked into her mouth.</p><p>“I love you.” Rio whispered.</p><p>Agatha brought a hand to her cheek, brushing away the stray hairs in front of her face. “I love you too.”</p><p>She nuzzled her nose against her girlfriend’s for a beat before pulling back. “Close your eyes.”</p><p>Blue eyes did not close. “What?”</p><p>Rio got off the bed, still buck naked, and walked over to the dresser. “Close your eyes.”</p><p>“Baby, if this is about you not liking me watching while you put on the strap, I told you I don’t look and–”</p><p>She pulled open the top drawer, where they kept their strap, but also their socks. “It’s not. Just close your eyes, woman.”</p><p>Agatha huffed but did so, slinging her forearm over her face for good measure. “Fine.”</p><p>Rio made her way back over, the box secured in her grasp. “Hold out your hand.”</p><p>“I <i>also</i> told you that we need to buy better cuffs. That locking mechanism is child's play–”</p><p>“Hand.”</p><p>Agatha whipped out her left arm, hand gingerly dangling. “Better be good.”</p><p>“It is.” Rio opened the box, sliding the cool metal against skin. “Open.”</p><p>Her girlfriend moved her forearm, eyes fluttering open and focusing on the ring now adoring her left ring finger. She furrowed her brows in an obtuse manner, lips pouting. “What’s this?”</p><p>“A ring.” Rio grinned, admiring the way the stone sparkled in the light.</p><p>“Yes, I realize that. What is it doing on my finger?”</p><p>“Thought it would look good there.”</p><p>“Riiiiight…” Agatha sat up, inspecting the jewelry. “So is this a ring with diamonds or a diamond ring?”</p><p>“Well, it’s actually a green tourmaline. Way more ethical, and in my opinion, prettier than a blood diamond that somebody mined while being exploited for cheap labor.”</p><p>Dark green stone, emerald cut, thin gold band, <i>just</i> over a karat, and vintage. Rio saw it last month in a shop window on her way back to the hospital after grabbing some local and not terrible coffee (the only place on campus was a Dunkin’), and just knew she needed to get it on Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“The latter.”</p><p>“I don’t recall you proposing.”</p><p>“I thought I was doing that right now…?”</p><p>“You didn’t ask.”</p><p>“Agatha Evelyn Harkness,” Rio started, her girlfriend groaning at the use of her middle name which she hated. “Will you marry me?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, tilting her hand and making the stone refract the beams of sun. “I suppose, since it’s already on my hand and everything–”</p><p>Rio shot forward, tackling Agatha and pining her to the mattress. “You wanna be my wife so bad.”</p><p>“I do not!” She chuckled, barely putting up a fight.</p><p>“You do! You wanna be Mrs. Agatha Harkness-Vidal so bad, it makes you look stupid!”</p><p>Her fiancee blushed, fighting to speak through her belly laughs. “I’m not hyphenating, I’m gonna be Mrs. Vidal.”</p><p>Rio’s heart ticked up in speed, a genuine curl of her lips forming. “Mrs.Vidal?”</p><p>“It’s not like I’m in love with Harkness.” She snorted. “Besides, I like the thought of our kids being Vidals. It’s a good family name. <i>The Vidals</i>.”</p><p>“Dr. and Mrs. Vidal.” Rio said, getting a feel for their future. “I like it, sounds right.”</p><p>“Mmmh.” Agatha craned her head up, connecting their lips in a sweet kiss. “Now…celebratory engagement sex?”</p><p>“Fuck yes.” Rio jumped up, retrieving the strap for real this time. Her girlfriend propped up on her elbows and staring. “Okay, but…can you actually not watch?”</p><p>She flopped back down. “Oh my god!”</p><p>“What?! I feel awkward!”</p><p>“You’re ridiculous…”</p><p>“Mmmhh.” Rio fastened the harness, weaving the strap through the o-ring. “And you <i>love</i> me!” She then jumped onto the bed, settling herself on top of her fiancee.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks pulled tighter, her smile big and face rosy. “Sure.”</p><p>“Admit it.”</p><p>“I am fond of you.”</p><p>Rio lightly jabbed her side, right where she knew she was ticklish. “Admit it.”</p><p>“Rio!” She jerked, clumsily swatting Rio’s hand away through her giggles. “Ri- stop! Rio!”</p><p>“Admit it!”</p><p>“I love you!” She chuckled, finally relaxing once Rio pulled her hand away. “I love you.”</p><p>“Knew it.” Rio leaned in, her lips brushing Agatha’s. “I love you too. So much.”</p><p>“So much.”</p><p>A week later, Rio was parking her 1999 Subaru Forester in front of Agatha’s mom’s house. It was thanksgiving, the first they’d spend together since usually Rio was at the hospital. However, being newly engaged meant needing to actually <i>meet</i> her fiancee’s mom. Rio had never done so, despite Lilia and Agatha calling one another every week and spending a bare minimum of an hour on the phone every single time.</p><p>Rio didn’t particularly get along with her own parents, and didn't talk to them much. They were religious and conservative and proud of her for her education and career but not her ‘lifestyle choice’. They were part of that damned 44% of latinos that voted for Bush, so…enough said.</p><p>But it didn’t matter, because Rio was good with parents. Charming even. And any woman who produced someone as perfect as Agatha couldn’t be bad. As they walked up the frosted walkway to the door, Agatha stopped at the front door and hesitated. Her winter jacket swallowed her as she turned to face Rio.</p><p>“Listen, there’s a few things you need to know before we go in.”</p><p>Rio gave a nervous smile. “Like what?”</p><p>“My mom is loud, and completely lacking in boundaries, and <i>will</i> try to force feed you cannoli."</p><p>“How terrible…?”</p><p>“She’s also not…technically my mom.” Agatha raised her hands in defence at Rio opening her mouth to question. “Like, in every way she is. Just genetically, she didn’t birth me…”</p><p>Rio had assumed, like most people do, that Agatha was blood related to Lilia. She felt kind of douchey to have assumed that now, but her fiancee also never brought it up in the over two years they had been together.</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me you were adopted?” Rio tilted her head, genuinely just trying to understand.</p><p>Agatha let out a long breath. “Because I wasn’t.”</p><p>“I’m <i>so</i> lost.” She scratched her head through the knit beanie Agatha had made for her, a burnt orange color.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha let her shoulders drop, the tension leaving her body. “I grew up in foster care from when I was fourteen til’ I aged out. I don’t like talking about it because obviously it conjures <i>supper happy</i> memories and feelings...” She grimaced, “I bounced around about six different homes until I was placed with Lilia, which thank god, because she was the only one who was patient enough with me. She never formally adopted me, she offered, but by that time I was already about to turn eighteen and just didn’t want her to go through all the effort.”</p><p>Rio blinked a couple of times. “You grew up in foster care?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me sooner?”</p><p>“I don’t know…Lilia’s my mom and it’s good enough for me.” Her posture shrunk. “Didn’t want to answer questions as to <i>why</i> I was in the system to begin with.”</p><p>“You don’t have to explain anything to me.” She smiled, taking the hand that had the sparkly green stone. “Honestly, I’m just glad she’s not a republican.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “I think she’s still got her Obama ‘08 button somewhere.”</p><p>“<i>And cannoli</i>? Fuck, I lucked out in the in-law department.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, placing a chaste kiss against her lips. “I think I’m the lucky one.”</p><p>“Querida–”</p><p>The front door swung open, an older woman in flowy, patterned clothing appearing. Her hair was gray and curly and sitting atop her head in a rushed bun. “I waited as long as I could but you guys were taking too long and I got antsy.”</p><p>Agatha pulled away. “And to think I just called you patient.”</p><p>Lilia opened her arms. “You never visit, c’mere!”</p><p>Her fiancee huffed but threw her arms around her mom, letting the older woman engulf her. Her eyes then zeroed in on Rio, a grin spreading across her face. She let Agatha go, almost pushing her out of the way.</p><p>“The doctor!” Lilia then grabbed Rio, pulling her into a hug before she could react. “I’ve heard a lot about you.”</p><p>Rio brought her arms up, hugging back and looking at Agatha. “A lot, huh?”</p><p>Seven months later, they got married. They signed the paperwork and filed the marriage license in Massachusetts, one of the few states at the time where they could get legally wed. But, because they were young and in love, they also had one of those kitschy chapel weddings in Vegas. Agatha wore a $20 slip dress, short and off-white. Rio thrifted a suit, not bad for a men’s petite, honestly. Jen and Alice accompanied them, the trip costing most of their savings but very worth it for the memory alone. After leaving the chapel, tipsy and giggly, they passed a tattoo parlor. It was a little seedy, but they did $10 flash pieces. Leading Agatha to getting a cursive <i>R</i> on the side of her ribcage, Rio getting a cursive <i>A</i> in the same spot. It was a fucking miracle neither of them got a staph infection from it.</p><p>Around 2AM, the four of them were aimlessly wandering around their resort casino, when Agatha stopped at the craps table. Jen and Alice were playing slots as Rio supported her wife in her frivolous endeavor to spend money that they didn’t have. She leaned over the table, dress riding up and a cheap veil still stuck to her head.</p><p>“Blow.” Agatha held up the dice.</p><p>“Baby…”</p><p>“It’s good luck!”</p><p>“This is not luck, it’s chance.”</p><p>“We met by chance, we met again by luck.” Agatha pouted, still holding up the dice. “Blow me, baby.”</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue against her cheek. “Sounds familiar.”</p><p>“You’re not gonna blow your wife?” She cocked her head. “It’s for a good cause.”</p><p>Rio smirked, quickly blowing on the sticky looking dice. “Happy?”</p><p>“Ecstatic.” Agatha turned, underhand throwing the dice along the felt of the table.</p><p>“Seven.” The casino guy called, clearing the table. “Congrats.”</p><p>Agatha, still not sober, blinked as he handed her a chip. Rio peered over her shoulder to see how much she had won.</p><p>“$5,000?!” Rio nearly screamed.</p><p>Agatha scrunched her nose, pursing her lips in victory. “Not bad for a $300 buy-in, huh?”</p><p>“My apologies to lady luck.”</p><p>Agatha slung her arms over Rio’s shoulders, drunkenly leaning into her. “Wanna take lady luck back to the room, handsome?”</p><p>“Fuck yes.”</p><p>The casino payout, mixed with a loan from Lilia, paid for the down payment of their home the following year. The housing market still recuperating after the 2008 recession also helped <i>temedously.</i></p><p>Wishbones being broken doesn’t guarantee luck and fortune to whoever got the bigger part. Throwing salt over one’s shoulder does not protect them or dissipate some non-existent bad karma. Black cats don’t signify death approaching.</p><p>Rio knew this, and yet, she felt like the luckiest woman alive.</p><hr/><p>“Mami!” Nicky called down the hall, her voice clipped.</p><p>Rio hastily put on her scrub top, walking down the hall to her daughter’s room. “What?”</p><p>“Have you seen my green button up?”</p><p>“The kinda olive toned one?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows. “No, but that's probably because it’s your mom’s and you keep stealing it from her.”</p><p>Agatha had that button up since before they started dating, Rio could quite literally count the times she shucked that shirt off to, well–</p><p>Not the time to think about that.</p><p>It was mid October, the usual morning panic occurred as Rio got herself ready for work and Nicky ready for school. She leaned against the doorframe. “You need it that bad?”</p><p>“Yes!” Nicky threw up her arms, currently dressed in jeans and a tank top. “I had a vision for this outfit.”</p><p>“A vision…sounds pretty serious.”</p><p>“I think it’s at mom’s place.”</p><p>“Sorry, teddy.”</p><p>“Can we stop there on the way to school?”</p><p>“Mi vida–”</p><p>“Please.” Nicky asked, using those huge amber eyes to her advantage.</p><p>“You literally have a whole closet of flannels, maybe too many. And I say that as a lesbian.”</p><p>“C’mon, if we leave now, we can stop with plenty of time.”</p><p>Rio sighed, “Fine. Text your mom, I'll throw something in the toaster for us to eat on the go.”</p><p>“It’s fine.” She dismissed, pulling out her phone.</p><p>“Hey, breakfast is important for a reason, and it is my legal obligation to feed you.”</p><p>After scarfing down frozen waffles, Rio diligently drove her daughter to the townhouse. She parked her 2025 Subaru Forrester on the street and watched as Nicky ran up the steps, using her key to get inside. Five minutes later, and no Nicky. Rio turned off her car, making her way up to the front door and letting herself in.</p><p>As Rio entered, she could feel the rage of her daughter before locating her. The kitchen and living room were empty, so she jogged upstairs, the sounds of voices becoming clearer.</p><p>“Seriously?!” Nicky shouted.</p><p>“Baby, I know you’re upset.” Agatha tried to soothe.</p><p>Rio scrunched her face, her gut swirling to signify danger. She walked to the open door of Agatha’s room, popping her head in.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Rio could’ve gone her whole life without this image seared into her head. She’d need to bleach her eyes later, this was too cruel of an image.</p><p>Agatha speaking to Nicky as Wanda laid in bed, fucking mortified. She should note that they were both fully clothed, but it still made her nauseous. Agatha hadn’t even switched out the mattress before sleeping with another woman in a room they once used to share.</p><p>“I texted you and you couldn’t have moved your bimbo!” Nicky groaned, tears welling.</p><p>“Nicky, I didn’t see it.” Agatha, dressed in a robe and hair wild, spoke. Rio remembers when she’d get to wake up to that sight, of Agatha sleepy with her bedhead. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>To be fair, it was Rio’s week and this was sprung on her ex wife with little notice.</p><p>“Can I just-” Nicky's voice broke. “Can I just have the shirt so I can go?”</p><p>Agatha’s own blue glazed over with tears, a somber smile appearing. “Yeah, yeah of course.” And opened the door to the walk-in closet, now half empty where RIo’s clothes used to hang.</p><p>Rio sucked in a harsh breath, accidentally making eye contact with her wife’s girlfriend. “Wanda.”</p><p>The red head winced, her hand covering her face. “Rio.”</p><p>Agatha flung the hanger back into the closet, handing the shirt to Nicky. “Hon–”</p><p>Nicky snatched the shirt and bolted out of the room, stomping down the stairs.</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio. “Really?”</p><p>“I told her to text you! How was I supposed to know Wanda would be here?”</p><p>“A call would’ve been nice.”</p><p>Rio wanted to scream that she shouldn’t have to call her own fucking wife, but that wasn’t reality. She bit back the bile in her throat. “Dually noted.”</p><p>Agatha’s face was stone. “Thanks.”</p><p>“Have a good day molding young minds.” Rio said, turning to leave.</p><p>“Have a good day saving babies.” Agatha murmured.</p><p>And Rio was aware of the connotations, the verbal jab. She didn’t take the bait though, going back downstairs and out to her car. She got in, her daughter trying very hard not to cry.</p><p>“Nicky…” She spoke, “Whatever you’re feeling is okay.”</p><p>“I hate her.” Her daughter said, tears spilling down her face. “I <i>hate</i> her.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes closed, willing the tears to stop. Thank god she hadn’t said that to her ex wife’s face, it would pulverize Agatha to hear it.</p><p>“No, you don’t.”</p><p>“I do!”</p><p>“No.” Rio said softly. “You don’t. She didn’t do anything to hurt you.”</p><p>“She–”</p><p>“I know. But it wasn’t on purpose, mija.</p><p>“It feels like she doesn't care.”</p><p>“She does. She cares <i>so</i> much.”</p><p>“Could’ve fooled me.” Nicky openly sobbed, using the back of her hand to wipe the snot. “I thought they were done. Hadn’t seen that <i>puta</i> in a month.”</p><p>Yeah, Rio was aware that Agatha had pulled back on integrating Wanda into family activities. They did that family dinner, just the three of them, last month. It was surprisingly tame, no yelling or fighting. But Rio was also aware that Agatha hadn’t ended things with Wanda, much to her own despair.</p><p>“Her dating doesn’t mean she doesn’t care about or love you. She’s a person outside of being your mom, teddy.”</p><p>“I know, I just-” Nicky cried, “I just thought that if she was single then…”</p><p>Then they’d get back together.</p><p>Her daughter just wanted her parents together.</p><p>Not a crazy thing to ask, or to want.</p><p>Hell, Rio would rip her own heart out of her chest and physically give it to her ex if it would mean they could go back to how they used to be.</p><p>“Oh, baby.” Rio cooed, pulling her daughter over the center console and hugging her. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Nicky’s frame shook in her arms, her mascara almost definitely staining Rio’s scrub top. They sat there for a few minutes until Nicky pulled back, wiping her eyes and pulling on Agatha’s shirt. She sniffled, shaking her head. “Can’t fucking belive her.”</p><p>“Mija, I'm just as guilty. You’re not being fair to her.”</p><p>“But you haven’t moved on! You’re not trying to replace your marriage with a woman almost a decade younger!”</p><p>Agatha was forty-two and Wanda was thirty-five so by no means was it midlife crisis territory, but Wanda being younger didn’t necessarily help Rio’s growing resentment.</p><p>“What happened between us had nothing to do with you.”</p><p>“Can we get coffee?” Nicky asked out of the blue, changing the topic of conversation.</p><p>Jesus, if only she recognized just how much her and Agatha were alike.</p><p>Rio turned the key in the ignition, starting the car. “Yeah, I think we’ve earned it this morning.”</p><p>Once her teenage daughter was irresponsibly caffeinated and dropped off at school, Rio got to the hospital. She made her rounds, but her smile grew when she got to her favorite patient.</p><p>William Kaplan, six years old, preferred to go by Billy. He had been coming to her almost since he was born, around the time she’d lost a kid of her own. He had leukemia and had endured more surgeries than anyone should in their life, let alone someone so young.</p><p>So, naturally, Rio felt a type of kinship with him.</p><p>She walked in, chart in hand. “Billy!”</p><p>“Rio!” He chirped, dinosaur stuffy in his clutches. Rio had given it to him over a year ago and he still held onto it as a symbol of pride. A reward for being brave.</p><p>“How are we feeling today, dude?” She asked, giving a nod to his parents. “I’m not saying I don’t like you guys, but I would <i>love</i> to stop seeing you here.”</p><p>“Feeling is mutual.” Rebecca said, face gray and tired.</p><p>“I feel okay.” Billy informed, his small body propped up on the bed. The chemo and cancer had stunted his growth, causing him to look much younger than he actually was. “Tommy’s ear is falling off.”</p><p>Tommy, the dinosaur, did have a loose ear.</p><p>“I keep meaning to sew it but–” Rebecca started.</p><p>“Oh, it's fine.” Rio said, gently taking the dinosaur and inspecting it. “I think he just needs a small surgery.”</p><p>“Like me!” Billy smiled.</p><p>Rio grinned. “<i>Exactly</i> like you.”</p><p>The rest of the day was fine, she got Billy’s surgery on the books and scarfed down what she could in between running around. Being a surgeon didn’t exactly mean getting to clock in and out at an exact time, so around 3PM, she called her ex. Agatha usually picked up Nicky or their daughter took the bus, however she didn’t anticipate being late today.</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha answered.</p><p>“Can you pick up Nicky? I’m not getting out of here anytime soon.”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Why do you sound surprised? She is my child.”</p><p>“Yeah, I know that, I guess I just figured you’d still be pissed.”</p><p>“I am, but not at her.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio worked her jaw. “I’m sorry for this morning, I thought you knew.”</p><p>Silence from the other end for a minute, then a sigh. “I’m sorry too. I didn’t want you or her seeing that.”</p><p>She bit her lip for a moment, never knowing when to leave well enough alone. “Yeah, me too.”</p><p>“It wasn’t on purpose!”</p><p>“I know. I just–”</p><p>Love you and wish you loved me back.</p><p>Want our family back.</p><p>Want you back.</p><p>Hate seeing our daughter cry.</p><p>“I’ve just had a long day.”</p><p>“I’ll pick up Nicky and bring her back to yours.” The line went dead immediately after, no room for argument.</p><p>Rio’s hand dropped from her ear, her phone going black.</p><p>“Fuck.” She muttered.</p><hr/><p>Nicky didn’t speak to Agatha as they drove home, her daughter decidedly keeping her mouth in a straight line. If she could go back in time to this morning, she would've happily kicked her girlfriend out before her daughter and ex arrived.</p><p>She’d beaten herself up for the past month, wondering if she should cut her losses and break up with Wanda. Sure, Wanda was attractive and smart, but she wasn’t worth the emotional toll it was taking on Nicky. But Wanda was also easy. Easy to be around, easy to spend time with, non offensive. And if she could just check out of the reality of her life for a tiny bit, should she have that right?</p><p>Wanda didn’t know about Agatha’s mother, or her upbringing. She wasn’t there when Agatha woke up in a hospital room, recovering from being sliced open and her baby missing. She didn’t witness Agatha rotting away in bed for weeks after, physically too frail to walk farther than the bathroom.</p><p>Wanda was just <i>simple</i>.</p><p>They got to Rio’s loft, Agatha holding the door open for a very grumpy thirteen year old. When Nicky started for her bedroom without saying anything, Agatha stopped her.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Agatha said, dropping her keys on the kitchen island. “Teddy, I’m really, <i>really</i> sorry.”</p><p>Her daughter, backpack still slung on her shoulder, olive green shirt still on her body, looked at her. “I never understood why mami always took your side. I thought maybe she was just a doormat. But then I really thought about it, why she would defend you no matter what.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say a word, she wanted to know what her daughter was thinking.</p><p>“And then I realized, all those times I left the house and came back to you in a better mood. When I’d spend the day with friends and get back to your place and see you changing the sheets.” Nicky’s eyes went glassy. “And it was <i>always</i> after a break up….”</p><p>“Nicky.”</p><p>“You guys were hooking up, right? You didn’t want me to know but I do and now you’re keeping mami on hold again.”</p><p>Way more than a kid should ever know about their parents.</p><p>And Agatha wasn’t keeping Rio on hold.</p><p>“Your mami is free to see whoever she wants.”</p><p>“And you know she won’t!” She dropped her backpack. “I’m not stupid, I watch you guys just as closely as you watch each other. She loves you and you let her. You date Wanda before mami can even <i>think</i> about someone else. You lost Alex and you fucking threw mami out!”</p><p>Agatha knew being a teenage girl, the anguish and the rage. But shit, if her own daughter wasn’t demolishing her bit by bit right now. She understood she couldn’t just smother Nicky with love, a pine tree doesn’t grow in a shotglass or whatever the fuck. But the need to reach out and make everything better was going haywire in her brain, to stop her baby’s pain.</p><p>“I understand that I’ve not been perfect, I get it. But, I’m not trying to cause you or mami pain.”</p><p>Nicky scoffed, cocking her head. “You don’t have to, you’re just naturally talented at it.” She picked up her backpack, running upstairs and shutting her bedroom door.</p><p>Agatha dropped her head into her hands, setting her elbows on the kitchen island. The tears stung as they escaped, stifling any sound so her daughter wouldn’t hear. She didn’t need Nicky feeling guilty, she just wanted her daughter to not hate her. She must’ve been standing there for twenty, thirty minutes.</p><p>The door gently shut and she whipped her head over at the noise, her ex standing there with a pizza. Rio set down the pizza, face etched with concern.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>And Agatha didn’t have the words, so she just reached out, grabbing her ex and burrowing her head into her shoulder and sobbing. “She hates me.”</p><p>“Second Vidal to cry on me today…” Rio’s arms reacted on instinct, embracing her. “She doesn’t. She’s thirteen.”</p><p>“I hated my mother at thirteen.”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio pulled back fractionally, grabbing Agatha’s face and gently cradling it. “You’re <i>nothing</i> like your mother.”</p><p>“I’m fucking everything up.” Agatha sniffled, “I-I’m a terrible mom.”</p><p>Because that’s what it felt like, her relationship with her daughter collapsing because she couldn't just move on and get past Alex. Because Agatha let it consume her, let it eat her alive.</p><p>Her ex wife’s face scrunched, a cute frown forming. “You’re a great mom.”</p><p>“Great moms don’t have screaming matches with their kids.”</p><p>“I doubt it was a screaming match. You’re always louder, cariño.”</p><p>Against her better judgement, Agatha released a small chuckle. “I should go.”</p><p>“Why? It’s Friday, there’s pizza. I have booze.”</p><p>“Tempting.” Agatha grabbed her keys. “But I think I need to wallow alone. Nicky doesn’t want me here.”</p><p>Rio’s face fell. “Okay.”</p><p>“Hug her for me?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Agatha opened the door, leaving her daughter to her solitude. “She knows about us fucking periodically, by the way.”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>“Yeah, so…have fun with that.”</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>“Do you want me to go up there with you? See what happens?” She quirked a brow. “Really?”</p><p>Rio exhaled a breath. “I see your point, and while I don’t like it, I do respect it.”</p><p>“See you Sunday.”</p><p>As Agatha closed the door she heard “See you Sunday.”</p><p>As she got in her car Agatha slumped in the seat, her phone pinging at the same time. She lifted her hips, blindly fishing it out of her pocket and reading the text.</p><p><b>Wanda, 5:22:</b> Drinks? My place? We can drown in a bubble bath together.</p><p>She rolled her eyes, which wasn’t fair considering her girlfriend wasn’t privy to what she’d just endured from her daughter. If Agatha couldn’t spend the night with her daughter, she’d just rather spend it alone.</p><p><b>Agatha, 5:24:</b> Swamped with grading. Raincheck?</p><p><b>Wanda, 5:25:</b> Sure, I love you.</p><p>Agatha locked her phone, running a stressed hand through her hair. Ignoring her girlfriend because she couldn’t get her brain off Nicky. Maybe ending things would be for the best.</p><p>Maybe being alone would be better.</p><p>Then her mind flashed to hugging her ex wife, how safe it felt. How it remedied everything all at once. How she could’ve stayed there for longer, as long as Rio would’ve allowed.</p><p>No, she was not supposed to think that.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>She could fix it, this problem could be solved.</p><p>She opened her phone again, thumbs flying across the screen.</p><p><b>Agatha, 5:29:</b> On second thought, I can be there in an hour…</p>

<p>“That’s the last of it.” Jen groaned, haphazardly dropping the box and kicking the front door closed.</p><p>Agatha rushed over, inspecting the wood of the door. “We <i>just</i> got the place, could you not?”</p><p>Jen cocked her head. “We’re helping you move all your shit in for free. So no.”</p><p>“You get the place checked for mold? It’s ancient.” Alice gawked, peering around the corner into the living room.</p><p>“Of course.” Rio said, digging through a box, “Not exposing my wife and future children to that.”</p><p>“Good.” Jen replied, running a hand over the century old banister of the staircase. “Because once that shit’s in your lungs…”</p><p>“Oh, I know.” Rio huffed, “Last thing I need is neurological issues twenty years down the line–”</p><p>“Oh my god.” Agatha snapped, pushing past the lot of them towards the kitchen. “Fuck, I will <i>not</i> miss living with three doctors. Fucking nerds.”</p><p>
<b>January, 2011.</b>
</p><p>And they had just spent the day trekking through snow and sleet to get everything moved into their new home. The one they <i>owned</i>. Agatha was pretty sure that was a first for a Harkness woman. Evanora just bounced from apartment to apartment until they evicted her ass, and subsequently, Agatha’s too.</p><p>They had gotten it at a bargain, the townhome being a little rough around the edges. Meaning, it was old and in desperate need of several thousand updates and repairs. But, Agatha’s hot and sexy wife swore she could do most everything herself with the exception of the ensuite bathroom off the master bedroom.</p><p>Agatha didn’t know much about the bathroom but did nearly keel over at the puny size of the closet in that same bedroom. Do people just not shop? Do they not need a different pair of jeans for each individual outfit? For the love of god, who owns less than ten pairs of shoes? Rio might call her a clothing hoarder, Agatha liked to think of herself as a curator. The fact that most of her life had been contained to a garbage bag or less for most of her adolescence might have something to do with it, but she digresses.</p><p>Rio promised to build her a walk-in, additionally, she also promised to line their living room with bookshelves for Agatha’s ever growing collection of literature. She <i>was</i> an English teacher after all, Rio knew what she was getting herself into.</p><p>They had a very precise budget to stick to, sure Rio was an attending now, and Agatha had taken on teaching an AP lit course to make more income, but money was still tight. Hence why they bribed their friends with the promise of beer and pizza if they helped them move. Jen and Alice didn’t keep the old house once Rio and Agatha announced they had found a place, instead they opted to get a swanky apartment near the hospital.</p><p>Alice was in pediatrics with Rio, Jen had one more year as a resident since she was in obstetrics and gynecology and had one more year of residency to complete. Probably the reason why they weren’t engaged yet, Jen wanted to be an attending before planning a wedding.</p><p>“Fine,” Jen smirked, “But the next time you have a UTI–”</p><p>“That was <i>one</i> time!” Agatha defended, opening the fridge and grabbing four beers. “And you can thank my lovely wife for that.”</p><p>Rio had kept her tied to the bed too long, consensually of course, but they probably should’ve taken a break for Agatha to pee.</p><p>Her wife grinned. “That was a good anniversary…”</p><p>“Gross.” Alice scrunched her face, taking a beer for her and Jen from Agatha’s hands.</p><p>The next couple of months proceeded with Agatha and Rio spending nearly every night and weekend working on the house. And she had to admit, there was something sick about her wife drilling and hammering shit in a beater tank. Agatha would diligently stand there, holding whatever for Rio, all the while drooling over how Rio’s arms fucking flexed. She pulled <i>so well</i>, those tattoos glistening with sweat as Rio ripped out drywall or lugged heavy shit around.</p><p>Needless to say, they got distracted.</p><p><i>A lot</i>.</p><p>She was pretty sure they had christened their new home fairly quickly, no room went unscathed. One memory in particular, of them installing the new counter tops before Rio bent her over said countertops, would always stay implanted in her brain. It’s not her fault their sex life was fucking addictive, it just <i>was</i>.</p><p>Agatha always felt her most powerful during sex. She felt strong and desired and she didn’t feel shame in that. Her wife felt the same way, apparently, dutifully falling to her knees when Agatha dropped her voice even slightly. Rio fucked Agatha like it was a privilege, which sometimes, she decided it was. She would make Rio beg and plead to just go down on her.</p><p>See? Powerful.</p><p>It was early spring when her wife texted, asking if Agatha could drop off some dinner since Rio would most likely be stuck at the hospital all night. Agatha agreed, getting off the couch and saving the spot in her book. She threw on her wifes Red Soxs hoodie and some leggings before heading out, she had been to the hospital a multiple times, but it was a still fucking maze.</p><p>She eventually stumbled upon the pediatric wing, lunchbox in hand. Agatha found the nurses station, making sure to drop them off some homemade cookies because while she wasn’t a great cook, she could bake pretty damn well. And the cookies ensured they were all nice to her wife, and everyone should be nice to Rio lest they be beaten very violently with a rock by Agatha. Once she chatted with them for far longer than she had actually wanted to, she went on the hunt for her wife. She knew Rio wasn’t in surgery because as a doctor’s wife, she had learned the routine. Nothing on the board indicated that she had anything scheduled, also, Rio’s lucky scrub cap was still on their dresser. It was one that Agatha had gifted her their first Christmas together, black and white with Snoopy patterned all over it and yellow Woodstocks.</p><p>She stopped briefly at the observation window where all the newborns laid in their small plastic bassinets. All soft, and squishy, and safe. She pouted her bottom lip, her brows furrowing as if the mere sight of a baby was going to make her burst into tears.</p><p>No.</p><p>Her and Rio had agreed to wait a few more years before starting their family, not ideal because Agatha was almost thirty and wanted her kids to be kind of closer together in age, but it was what they landed on. Rio had made it clear early on that she wanted kids, just had no interest in carrying. Which was fine by Agatha because despite her own upbringing, she actually liked the idea of being pregnant. Maybe something inside her wanted to give her kid the childhood she never had, which scared the fuck out of her. Because what if that was the same thought her mother had when she was pregnant with Agatha? Shouldn’t it have been? To bring a child into the world wanting to love them?</p><p>One of the babies cooed, a bundle of mush that would grow up to be an actual human. Agatha gently shook her head, she had to find her wife before she went crazy. She kept moving, the sterile smell of antiseptic burning her nostrils. She kept wandering until she hit the NICU, spotting her wife through the window.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Rio was holding a baby, a premie at that, slowly swaying in a rocking chair and nonsensically whispering. The hand with her simple gold wedding band cradled the tiny body, a soft smile on her face, her hair frenzied and scrubs wrinkled.</p><p>
<i>Is it wrong that the sight turned Agatha on?</i>
</p><p>Maybe it was a biological impulse but all she could think was how her wife needed to get her pregnant, as soon as humanly possible preferably. Agatha raised her hand, gently tapping her knuckles on the glass, watching as Rio’s eyes trailed up and met her own. Her wife’s smile grew, her gaze somehow softening even further.</p><p><i>I need to have her baby.</i> Agatha’s obviously hormonal brain helpfully supplied. <i>Biblically.</i></p><p>Once the baby was back in their crib, safe and sound, Rio met her in the hall. Her wife sprung forward, resting her hands on her waist as she kissed Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>“Thank you for dinner.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head towards the window. “Patient of yours?”</p><p>“Yeah. Her mom is a single parent, works late. She’s getting stronger medically, but I try to make sure she gets some physical touch. Babies don’t thrive without it.”</p><p>Yeah, neither did Agatha.</p><p>“Is that why you’ve been staying late so much recently?”</p><p>Rio flushed, slightly embarrassed. “I always earned high grades in bedside manner.”</p><p>Agatha handed her the lunchbox. “You have a minute?”</p><p>“Yeah? You wanna have dinner together?”</p><p>She smirked. “In a way.”</p><p>Eight minutes later Agatha had her wife pinned against the door of an on-call room, greedily groping at her body through her scrubs.</p><p>Rio’s hand fisted in her hair, biting her lip not to moan. “Where’d this come from?”</p><p>“You with a baby, mostly.” Agatha husked, one hand traveling underneath the waistband of Rio’s pants, the other wedging itself in her wife's sports bra. “So fucking hot.”</p><p>“I wor- work with babies a lot, cariño.” Her wife rasped as Agatha mouthed along her neck, as fingers lightly pinched her nipple. “Christ–”</p><p>“Yeah, but <i>seeing</i> it?” Agatha had to hold back her moan, her fingers brushing over trimmed hair. “God, I need to fuck you.”</p><p>Rio raised her arm, glancing at her watch. “I have ten minutes to eat before they’ll get suspicious.”</p><p>“I only need five.”</p><p>Two orgasms and six minutes later, her wife lounged on the twin bed, languidly eating the pb&amp;j sandwich Agatha had made her. There was also a bag of chips, some celery and baby carrots, a sugar free redbull, and a homemade cookie.</p><p>Agatha happily laid next to her wife, ignoring her own arousal for the time being and letting Rio scarf down enough to keep her going.</p><p>“So, are you actually going to tell me what that was about?” Rio asked, sucking some peanut butter off her thumb.</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Guess seeing you like that did something to me…”</p><p>“Seeing me like what?”</p><p>“I don’t know…maternal?”</p><p>“Agatha–”</p><p>It wasn’t the right time, they should wait. Agatha already knew what Rio would say, and she’d rather not hear it. So, she shifted gears.</p><p>She quickly leaned over, giving Rio a chaste kiss before sitting up. “I should go, it’s 9PM and I have school tomorrow.”</p><p>Her wife sat up too. “Okay.”</p><p>She stood, kissing her once more. “Try to be home at a reasonable hour?”</p><p>“No promises.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Enjoy the food and the post-sex glow.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Yeah, you should visit me at work more often.”</p><p>“Mmhhh.” Agatha hummed, quirking a brow. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go home and masturbate furiously in our marital bed before passing out.”</p><p>Rio’s face twisted forlornly. “Mi amor!”</p><p>Agatha opened the door, throwing a wink as she left. “Have a good night saving babies.”</p><p>She kept her word, enjoying three self induced orgasms before falling asleep, idly noting her wife crawling into bed around two o’clock in the morning. Agatha could smell the cedar of Rio’s perfume and that familiar antiseptic. A warm hand grazed her hip, fingers playing with the waistband of her underwear. Agatha was a big advocate for the big shirt and no pants combo when she went to bed, her wife knew and absolutely loved this.</p><p>“Mornin’.” Agatha grumbled, only half awake. She turned over, peeking her eyes open enough to see Rio grinning.</p><p>“Morning.” Her wife said, hand now fully sheathed in Agatha’s panties.</p><p>“How are you horny at this hour?” She gasped as Rio trailed her fingers through her already wet cunt.</p><p>“Thought I’d return the favor.” Rio reasoned, lurching forward to kiss her. “And we need to talk.”</p><p>“Right now?” Agatha asked, raising her own hand to tangle in Rio’s t-shirt. “C-can it wait?”</p><p>“You’re more honest when you’re about to come.”</p><p>“Fuck off.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers steadily worked her up. “What got into you tonight?”</p><p>“I-uh,” Agatha swallowed. “You looked good.”</p><p>“I always look good to you, there’s more.”</p><p>Curse this woman for always seeing through her, and fuck her for knowing an orgasm was like a truth serum on Agatha.</p><p>She arched her back and hiked her leg over Rio’s hip once she felt two fingers find her entrance. “You…with a baby, it- it did something for me.”</p><p>“How so?”</p><p>Agatha let out a soft moan as Rio started thrusting. “Thought about you with our own…”</p><p>“Our own?”</p><p>“Baby. Our own baby.”</p><p>Rio’s thumb came to her clit, massaging it. “Our kid, huh? Your eyes and attitude in a tiny body?”</p><p>“Y-your eyes.” She corrected, her stomach swirling. “And your tooth gap, your crooked smile–”</p><p>“You wanna have my babies, mi alma?”</p><p>Fucking obviously.</p><p>“The- the attitude though should be mine. You’re too nice.”</p><p>“Oh that kid would rule the world.”</p><p>“Yeah.” She breathed out, so fucking close.</p><p>And of course that was the exact moment Rio stopped, ignoring Agatha’s whine in protest. “Should we get started on that?”</p><p>Agatha’s brain worked to play catch-up. “We said we’d wait.”</p><p>“Doesn’t seem like you want to.”</p><p>“Do you?”</p><p>“I think you’d look so <i>fucking good</i> carrying my baby.” Rio said, starting to pump again. “The image alone–”</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha whimpered, walls clenching around her wife’s fingers. “Fuck, fuck–”</p><p>“That’s it, baby.”</p><p>Her body tensed, body going slack once her orgasm dissipated. “We-we don’t have the money for a kid.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers stayed buried inside of her. “Straight people have kids with no money all the time. We’re already doing a lot better than most of them.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>Rio rolled onto her back, taking Agatha with her. She placed a hand on the small of Agatha’s back, helping her to get situated on top. “Not to brag, but my medical insurance is pretty kickass.”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha purred, hips rolling. “Keep talking dirty to me, love.”</p><p>“Covers IVF, genetic testing, fertility appointments…”</p><p>“Say shit like that and I’m gonna come again.”</p><p>“Almost nothing out of pocket…”</p><p>Yeah, Agatha came twice more that early morning, leaving her exhausted the rest of the day. But, it was worth it.</p><p>Rio saw Agatha in a way no one else ever had, or ever would. She was patient and loving, and spent those traits on Agatha for whatever deluded reason. She was cherished by her wife, and Agatha secretly thanked the universe or some unknown god for that every day.</p><p>Fate brought them together, and Agatha was grateful for it for fifteen years.</p><p>Well, thirteen.</p><hr/><p>“Mrs. Vidal?” The voice on the other end asked.</p><p>Agatha sat at her desk in between periods, physically recoiling at the use of her last name. She kept meaning to change it after the divorce, but just kept putting it off. She never liked the last name Harkness, it was her mothers.</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha answered, leaning back in her chair.</p><p>“I’m calling from your daughter’s school, we’re going to have to ask you and Nicky’s other mom to come down here.”</p><p>Her spine stiffened, shooting forward and leaning on her desk. “What’s wrong? Is she okay?”</p><p>“She’s fine, but she is in trouble. The principal is asking you to meet her as soon as possible.”</p><p>Trouble? Nicky got straight A’s. What fucking trouble?</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“Mrs. Vidal…she punched another student.”</p><p>Her daughter got Agatha’s fucking attitude alright.</p><p>She let out a sigh. “I’ll be there in an hour.”</p><p>After begging and pleading for one of her coworkers to watch her next class, Agatha hauled ass to her daughter’s middle school, striding down the hall towards the front office. She had called Rio, but no answer. Typical.</p><p>She rolled her shoulders back, cracking her neck before bursting through the door. Immediately seeing Nicky sitting in a chair near the secretary’s desk, ice pack on her knuckles. Across the room, another kid sat. Yikes, his face was <i>messed up</i>.</p><p>Agatha crouched down in front of her daughter. “You okay?”</p><p>Nicky, being her daughter, just nodded. She looked somewhat remorseful, but not upset. “I’m fine.”</p><p>“What the hell happened?”</p><p>“That guy was being a dick.” Nicky tilted her head towards the injured boy. “Pissed me off.”</p><p>“Easy there, scrapper.” Agatha grinned, “We only use violence when we know we won’t get caught.”</p><p>Nicky’s face pulled into a small smile, a light chuckle following. “Thought you’d be proud, I think I broke his nose.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, placing a soothing hand on Nicky’s knee. “I really hope his parents don’t sue.”</p><p>A door opened, the principal popping her head out. “Mrs. Vidal? A word?”</p><p>Working in the same district that her daughter was enrolled in, meant that she was already acquainted with most of the faculty. Including Nicky’s principal, Valentina Allegra de whatever. Agatha didn’t particularly care for the woman, her superiority practically leaked out of her.</p><p>She gave her daughter's knee a reassuring squeeze before following the  principal into her office, the door shutting behind her.</p><p>“Please, have a seat.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but did so.</p><p>“I’m sure you can understand why we called.”</p><p>She chuckled. “Yeah, I have a few ideas.”</p><p>“I won’t keep you long, I know it’s the middle of the school day.” Valentina insincerely smiled. “We just–”</p><p>The door clambered open, Rio sprinting through in her scrubs and jean jacket. Fuck, it was Novemeber and she wasn’t even in a winter coat yet.</p><p>“I’m here!” Rio announced, taking a seat next to Agatha. “Sorry, sorry.”</p><p>Valentina smirked. “That’s okay, <i>Dr. Vidal</i>. I know you’re busy saving lives.”</p><p>Agatha fought not to roll her eyes again, the amount of times women openly fawned over or hit on Rio throughout the years made her nauseous. Even while they were married, Nicky’s teachers, coaches, tutors, made their interest clear. Yes, Rio was a doctor, made good money, owned a nice loft, and was amazing in bed. But did every woman with a beating vagina have to recognize that?</p><p>“I was–” Rio laughed at herself. “I was actually performing surgery on a dinosaur.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha cocked her head.</p><p>“My patient, his stuffed dinosaur’s ear was loose. I sewed it for him so he could have it with him during his own surgery.”</p><p>Valentina fucking gushed at that. “That is <i>so</i> thoughtful of you. Those kids are lucky to have a doctor like you.”</p><p>“Yup, uh huh.” Agatha said. “So our daughter?”</p><p>“Right.” Valentina answered, though her eyes stayed on Rio. “She punched another student today during lunch.”</p><p>“Why?” Rio asked.</p><p>“The reason is unclear, but what is, is that your daughter is struggling.”</p><p>“Like, academically?” Agatha scrunched her face.</p><p>“No.” Valentina said. “We’ve noticed a change in Nicky over the past couple months, she’s more frustrated, quick to anger. Is something going on at home?”</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Agatha’s body deflated against the chair. “Uh, yeah.”</p><p>“Agatha’s been seeing someone.” Her ex wife happily supplied. “It’s been hard on Nicky.”</p><p>Valentina gave a sympathetic frown. “Poor girl.”</p><p>“Yes, we’re aware.” Agatha groaned.</p><p>“I’d recommend seeking some help.”</p><p>“Help?” Rio echoed.</p><p>“A therapist or counselor."</p><p>“You think Nicky needs therapy?” Agatha squawked. "She's not crazy.”</p><p>Valentina shrugged. “Therapy after parents splitting up and a new partner being introduced could help her. She’s always been an excellent student, so we’re willing to cut her some slack this time. But, I would urge you both to explore some resources.”</p><p>“Great.” Agatha hissed, standing. “Is Nicky free to go?”</p><p>“We’ll have you take her home today, but she’s welcome back tomorrow.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Rio chirped, standing and following Agatha out.</p><p>“Thank you, <i>doctor</i>.”</p><p>Keep it in your pants, lady.</p><p>Rio closed the door, exchanging a look with Agatha. Fuck, she thought the therapy was a good idea. Agatha shook her head, silently saying that they’d discuss it later.</p><p>It was Agatha’s week, so after calling the high school to let them know she’d be taking a half day, they collected Nicky and headed out to the car. Agatha unlocked it, letting Nicky get in the passengers side, hanging back to talk to her ex.</p><p>“You <i>honestly</i> think she needs therapy?!”</p><p>Rio cocked her head. “She’s yelling at you, she’s punching people…yeah, I do.”</p><p>“She’s a kid who’s going through something!”</p><p>“Yeah, and she shouldn’t have to do it alone, Agatha!”</p><p>“All a shrink will do is tell her that I ruined her life, which she is already aware of.”</p><p>Rio brought up a hand to rub her temple. “You didn’t ruin anything, a shrink could help her to see that. Hell, maybe it’d fix your relationship with her. I can’t be the bridge between you two forever.”<br/>
</p><p>And she knew it was mean but, “Like you don’t take a little pleasure in being her favorite.”</p><p>“No, I actually don’t!” Rio whisper shouted, mindful of Nicky in the car. “I hate it, Agatha! Our daughter is hurting, she’s struggling and we need to get her some help!”</p><p>“I can’t afford therapy.”</p><p>“Good thing I can.”</p><p>She fucking loathed when Rio did that, threw her money around. It made Agatha feel inadequate, like she couldn’t provide for her own child. It was bad enough she took money from Rio every month, now she needed to depend on her for this.</p><p>“Thank god for kickass insurance, right?” Agatha muttered, reaching for the door handle. “I’ll talk to her about it.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Rio checked her watch. “I gotta get back to the hospital, but call me tonight?”</p><p>“Can’t wait.” Agatha replied in a sickly sweet voice. “I look forward to it.”</p><p>Her ex wife just sighed, running around to the other side of the car and saying goodbye to Nicky before walking to her own car. Agatha got in, dropping the keys in her lap and looking at her daughter.</p><p>“Okay, seriously. What happened?”</p><p>Nicky held the melting ice to her bruised knuckles. “Nothing.”</p><p>“Teddy, I’m not mad, I just want to understand.”</p><p>Nicky turned her head, letting out a deep breath. “He was bullying a non verbal autistic kid, okay? Calling him names and slurs. And the teachers weren’t doing shit. And sue me, it pissed me off. He shoved the kid against the wall and nobody was doing anything!”</p><p>“Jesus, that’s some Disney villain shit.”</p><p>“I know! The kid started crying and no one blinked. I j-just got angry, okay? I won’t do it again.”</p><p>“Did you tell any of the teachers?”</p><p>“It was the first thing I did, but they said it was just ‘roughhousing’, boys will be boys type of stuff…”</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha mumbled, cautiously reaching out and placing her hand on Nicky’s forearm.</p><p>“It’s 2025, who bullies people in real life anymore? Have the decency to do it behind a screen, at least.”</p><p>“Assholes.”</p><p>“Am I in trouble?”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “No, but your mami and I do think it’d be good if you talked to someone.”</p><p>“Talked to someone?”</p><p>“A therapist, maybe.”</p><p>Nicky blinked, processing the information. “Why?”</p><p>“Teddy, things haven’t been okay lately, and I get why. But, you’re lashing out more, you’re angry all the time. It can’t be healthy.”</p><p>She expected her daughter to yell, to take offense, maybe even storm off. Miraculously, however, none of those things happened.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Okay?”</p><p>Nicky shrugged. “Better than being grounded.”</p><p>“Grounding would insinuate I don’t agree with your actions, I would’ve done the same thing.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Agatha picked up her keys, putting them in the ignition. “Oh, you have no clue the amount of men I’ve punched.”</p><p>“You sound proud.”</p><p>“I am, specifically of you.” She reached for the gearshift. “Let’s say we get some ice cream for you, bruiser.”</p><p>Nicky giggled. “I don’t think you’re supposed to reward me for this.”</p><p>“Definitely not and don’t tell your mami.”</p><p>“So, I get out of school early and get ice cream? Damn, mom. Thanks.”</p><p>And did her heart flutter at her daughter being nice to her? Sure. Was she being the best parent right now? No way in hell. But she had to take the small wins where she could get them. As she began backing out, her phone rang, bluetooth connecting to the screen on her dash, displaying Wanda’s name.</p><p>Fuck, this woman and her timing.</p><p>“What does Ethan Slater want?” Nicky muttered.</p><p>Agatha clicked the decline button. “Doesn’t matter.”</p><p>She’d call Wanda back, but right now, she had her kid. Nicky actually wanted to be around Agatha for the first time in months, she was holding onto this moment with a fucking chokehold.</p><p>Nicky fiddled with the screen, trying to find music. “How much Stevie Nicks have you loaded into this thing?”</p><p>“Just like every album, single, and live performance…”</p><p>“That might be gayer than your marriage to a woman.”</p>

<p>Rio rattled her keys around her finger, basically slumping up the steps to her townhouse. Her shift had been awful, losing a patient on hour thirteen of a fifteen hour shift. It was 7pm, the front porch left on by her wife for when Rio came home. The ice on the second step nearly taking her out completely, fuck she’s gotta salt that tomorrow.</p><p><b>December, 2011.</b></p><p>She slid her key into the lock, taking a moment before turning it. It’s not that she was avoiding going home, she was always happy to leave the day behind and focus on her wife. But they had been going through the process of getting Agatha pregnant for all of summer and fall. Rio had suffered through the hormone shots so they could go through with the egg retrieval, ending up with six embryos from ten eggs. The first embryo didn’t stick and they shrugged it off, knowing the likelihood of Agatha getting pregnant wasn’t high.</p><p>They had both gone through testing just to make sure they were healthy and wouldn’t run into any trouble trying to conceive. And while technically Agatha <i>could</i> carry, Jen was clear it would be harder for her. Rio was shocked, her wife had a normal cycle, nothing out of the ordinary, so when they got the news it made her falter.</p><p>There were things about her wife’s past that Rio knew she wasn’t aware of, Agatha’s childhood specifically. There were hints, the way Agatha’s left wrist was jutted out just <i>slightly</i> more than considered normal. To the common eye, nothing looked different, but Rio was a doctor, she knew what a broken bone that never healed properly looked like. There was the way Agatha ate, Rio would obviously never comment on it, but her wife did eat like her food would be snatched from her at any second. There was the way Agatha’s whole body went rigid whenever someone clapped even kind of near her head.</p><p>Rio never said anything, the context clues were enough.</p><p>But she did silently vow to herself that if she ever came across Evanora Harkness, that cunt was going to leave the scene in a fucking bodybag.</p><p>Because if Agatha was malnourished as a kid, it could explain why her body was struggling to carry a child now. So, they did another implantation with the second embryo–</p><p>No dice.</p><p>Rio comforted Agatha, letting her know it was nothing wrong with her and it would happen when it happened. And it worked up until the third embryo, when that test came back negative? Rio held Agatha on their bathroom floor as her wife sobbed, totally discouraged. And it hurt, it that Rio couldn’t fix it for her. She was literally a doctor, she fixed people for a living. But she couldn’t fix this.</p><p>So, as Rio stood with her key in the lock, she took a deep breath. They had just done another implantation with embryo number four and agreed to take the test together after Rio got home from work today. Hence her apprehension to go inside her home right now.</p><p>She was already so drained, having a child die in front of you kind of does that to a person. And she didn't know if she could be a good support for Agatha if another test came back negative. Working in pediatrics was great most days, kids are far more resilient than adults, but it also made the losses so much harder to take. There was a fine line between letting herself grieve appropriately and letting herself be consumed by it. Couldn’t go numb, but couldn’t get too invested either.</p><p>She turned the lock, opening the door and wiping the snow off the soles of her boots on the welcome mat.</p><p>“Baby?” Agatha’s voice called from the kitchen.</p><p>Rio took off her beanie and jacket, followed by her boots. “Hi.” She called back, shuffling down the hall.</p><p>“How was your day?”</p><p>“Fucking awful.” She turned the corner into the kitchen, finding her wife at the stove of all places. “You’re cooking?”</p><p>“I <i>do</i> know how.” Agatha quipped, dressed in a Mass Gen hospital sweater that she’d stolen. Rio got a lot of freebies with the hospital’s logo, which meant that they had Mass Gen mugs, mouse pads, sweaters, and pens. “Beer?”</p><p>“Uh, yeah.” Rio blinked, her wife seemed perky for whatever reason. “Special occasion?”</p><p>Agatha closed the fridge walking over and handing Rio the bottle, her face all rosy and cheery. “No, just felt like making sure you come home to a warm meal.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her gaze, twisting off the cap. Agatha didn’t really cook, she threw frozen shit in the oven and called it a day. And Rio <i>loved</i> her wife, hand to god, but anything Agatha did make was usually very underseasoned. Not her fault, she doubts that the monster who birthed Agatha knew how to properly season chicken, but Rio was cautious about whatever Agatha was about to serve.</p><p>“What are we having?” Rio asked, it smelled good in here, like garlic and herbs.</p><p>“My mom very graciously gave me her lasagna recipe.” Agatha checked the oven, setting the timer. “Don’t tell her I used store bought sauce, though.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, taking a sip. “Your secret is safe with me.”</p><p>“Why was today awful?” She asked, finally walking over and greeting Rio with a kiss.</p><p>“Lost a patient.”</p><p>Agatha’s face crinkled. “I’m sorry, baby.”</p><p>“Four years old.”</p><p>“Fuck.”</p><p>“Yeah, so…” Rio lifted her beer. “Good call on this.”</p><p>“Well, I think I know something that’ll cheer you up.”</p><p>“Cariño, I love you, but sex will not fix my mood–”</p><p>“It’s not that, c’mon.” She grabbed Rio’s wrist, leading them into the living room. It was the holiday season, so they had the tree up as well as all the kitschy Christmas decor.</p><p>Agatha sat Rio down on the couch, grabbing a small gift bag from underneath the tree. It had tiny dinosaurs with Santa hats printed all over, red tissue paper sticking out. She held it out in front of Rio, a small grin on her face.</p><p>Rio set her beer down, grabbing a coaster of course, Agatha didn’t appreciate rings on her Pottery Barn side tables. “Christmas isn’t for, like, three weeks.”</p><p>She shrugged. “Santa came early.”</p><p>Rio took the bag, quirking a brow as she did so. “Is this a pity present?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha chuckled, staring intently.</p><p>Rio pulled out the tissue paper, something fabric wrapped underneath all the layers. She set the bag aside, pulling at the paper. “New scrub cap?”</p><p>“I thought you liked Snoopy?”</p><p>“I <i>love</i> Snoopy. I’m just trying to figure out what you could’ve gotten me that would be <i>this</i> small.” Rio threw the rest of the paper elsewhere, a neatly folded square of white cotton revealed.</p><p>Rio’s fingers hooked under the fold, making it unravel. Her eyes widened as she read what the fabric said—</p><p>What the onesie said.</p><p>It had a drawing of Snoopy hugging Woodstock on the front, font below saying <i>The Vidals, est. 2012.</i></p><p>The onesie was for a newborn, meaning–</p><p>Rio finally looked up, tears in her eyes as it clicked. “You’re…”</p><p>“I ordered it when we first started trying.” Agatha’s smile took up her whole face, blue orbs going glassy as she nodded. “I couldn’t wait and I took a test this morning.”</p><p>Her jaw dropped, the tears coming out faster now. “You’re pregnant.”</p><p>“I’m pregnant.”</p><p>Rio dropped the onesie next to her, pulling at Agatha until she was in her lap. “<i>You’re pregnant.</i>”</p><p>Agatha laughed through her own tears. “We’ve established this.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you wait for me?” Rio questioned, her smile matching Agatha’s.</p><p>“I didn’t want to put you through all the crying again if it was negative.”</p><p>“Baby, you didn’t put me through anything.” She reassured, before trailing her gaze down to Agatha’s stomach. She splayed her hand on her wife’s lower abdomen. “My kid’s in there.”</p><p>Agatha only laughed harder. “You know damn well it’s only a bundle of cells in here.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio looked at her wife, who was currently sitting on her lap. “But it’s <i>our</i> bundle of cells.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands shot out to cradle Rio’s face. “I love you.”</p><p>“I love you too, mi alma. <i>So much</i>.”</p><p>“We have to come to a consensus about names now.”</p><p>“I just don’t see what’s so wrong with Luna.”</p><p>“I’m not naming my child after the moon!”</p><p>“The moon is cool!”</p><p>“Then you should’ve knocked up a different woman.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, bringing her hands to her wife’s hips. “No, I think I knocked up the right woman.” She smirked, dragging Agatha closer. “In fact, let me knock you up again.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “I don’t think that’s how that works.”</p><p>“No, it is. I’m a doctor, trust me.” Rio said, gently pushing Agatha so she was on her back, climbing on top of her. “If I work fast enough maybe we can go for twins.”</p><p>Agatha beamed, pulling her close. “Don’t make promises you can’t keep, my love.”</p><p>“Never.” Rio whispered, connecting their lips as her hand trailed under the waistband of Agatha’s sleep shorts. “Can’t let down the mother of my child.”</p><p>“I’m holding you to that.”</p><p>“Please do.”</p><p>Yeah, Agatha definitely did. Pregnancy did not treat Rio’s wife well. Throughout the following nine months, Rio never broke her promise. Agatha picked out nursery furniture? Rio built it. Agatha woke up in the dead of night craving a crunchwrap supreme? Rio drove to Taco Bell at 2am. Agatha was horny? Well, Rio was more than happy to oblige. Agatha was horny again? Rio was there, <i>happily</i>. Agatha was horny–</p><p>Yeah, pregnancy made Agatha kind of feral when it came to sex. Literally morning, noon, and night. Eventually it got to the point where Agatha would just greet Rio after work by telling her to go put on her cock. Which, Rio did <i>not</i> complain about. Her wife was fucking beautiful before pregnancy, but during? Yeah, it was a miracle they didn’t have to pry Rio off with a crowbar.</p><p>The downside was everything else. There were numerous occasions where Rio had to scoop Agatha off the bathroom floor and take her to the ER for dehydration. Her wife’s morning sickness was so intense that Agatha would drink something, and it would come back up still cold. Getting Agatha to keep anything down was also a challenge, Snoopy didn’t seem to like most food.</p><p>They called the baby Snoopy until they settled on a name, which took until month eight. Agatha was sprawled in their bed, huge shirt straining against her belly as Rio massaged her feet because those always ached. It didn’t help that Agatha’s third trimester was during the hottest time of the year. They didn’t even go to pride that year, Agatha was too uncomfortable standing in the sun.</p><p>“Camila.” Rio offered, thumbs digging into Agatha’s heel.</p><p>“Mmmm.” Agatha moaned, hands resting on her bump. “I like it, it’s pretty and it can be gender neutral as a nickname.”</p><p>Rio’s face scrunched. “Cam?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Nope, never mind.”</p><p>“Okay, Artemis?” Agatha offered, “Artie for short?”</p><p>“What’s up with you and Greek names?” Rio tilted her head. “And Artemis is terrible.”</p><p>“Fine.” She huffed. “I’ll keep thinking.”</p><p>“What about boy names?”</p><p>“We’re having a girl, my love.”</p><p>They found out as soon as humanly possible. Jen was Agatha’s OB and she very excitedly announced that they would not be contributing to the male population, which Rio was a little relieved by. She didn’t know how men worked, she had one brother but that was it. A girl was safer, she could relate to a girl.</p><p>“I know, but maybe we could pick a name from that list and make it work.”</p><p>“I liked August, but then I got an August assigned to my class and he’s a total prick. So, that name is ruined forever.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio laughed, still massaging. “I always liked Milo. We could do Mila?”</p><p>“That’s basically Camila, we’re back to square one.”</p><p>“Well, Snoopy is going to need a real name soon.”</p><p>“Oh my god!” Agatha sat up. “A few years back, I had a Nicholas in my sophomore English class and he was the sweetest boy ever. Kind, smart, considerate. Seriously, an angel. I had Nicholas on my list ever since then, but didn’t think we could use it. What about Nicola?”</p><p>“Nicola.” Rio tested it out, grinning. “Nicola Vidal.”</p><p>“Nicky for short, still gender neutral…”</p><p>“I think I’m stuck on Camila.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “What if Camila is the middle name?”</p><p>“Why does my pick get middle?”</p><p>Agatha cocked her head. “Sorry, who’s growing this child?”</p><p>She tucked her tongue against her cheek. “You are.”</p><p>“And will she not <i>also</i> have your last name?”</p><p>“She will.”</p><p>“So,” She raised a single brow, “I think that entitles me to the configuration of the name.”</p><p>“Nicola Camila Vidal.”</p><p>“Nicola Camila Vidal.”</p><p>“Sold.”</p><p>Nicky was born in September 2012, seven pounds, nineteen inches. Her wife’s labor was only a few hours, Rio joked that it was because Nicky had Agatha’s impatience. Agatha responded by crushing Rio’s hand, her <i>surgical</i> hand, on the next push. So labor is not a time for jokes, got it.</p><p>They laid in the hospital bed after, Agatha sweaty and shaky as she cradled their daughter, hair stuck to her face. Rio was next to her, peering down at their <i>perfect</i> baby girl. Her eyes took up most of her face, sparse brown hairs clinging to her head. Agatha trailed her index finger along Nicky’s cheek, smiling so hard Rio wondered if her face hurt. It must’ve, because Rio was wearing the <i>exact</i> same smile.</p><p>“Hi, little girl.” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“You did amazing, baby.” Rio said as she kissed her wife’s cheek. “She’s perfect.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze stayed glued to their daughter. “You let me down.”</p><p>“What?” Rio looked at her.</p><p>Agatha turned her head, giggling to herself. “Not twins.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, letting her body sink further into the bed. She might’ve let Agatha down, but as she watched her wife and child, something told her that it didn’t matter. They were everything to Rio–</p><p>And they always would be.</p><hr/><p>Agatha made a mental checklist in her head.</p><p>Nicky’s next dentist appointment.</p><p>Department meeting.</p><p>She <i>had</i> to go grocery shopping tomorrow.</p><p>And, shit, Nicky’s therapist left a message in the patient portal and Agatha hadn’t fucking read it yet.</p><p>“Are you close?” Wanda asked, popping her head out from between Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>Oh fuck, that’s right. Her moans must’ve stopped when she got distracted.</p><p>She was currently sprawled out in her bed, naked, with her girlfriend down on her knees and tongue between her thighs. This was <i>after</i> Agatha had so lovingly supplied her girlfriend with three ‘good morning’ orgasms, because fuck Rio, Agatha could be a giver.</p><p>Now, usually, Agatha had no problem speaking up when someone wasn’t fucking her correctly. But, it wasn’t even Wanda’s fault, any woman post-Rio couldn’t get the job done. Hell, it was why the booty calls occurred the second Agatha would become single again. It was never the woman, it was never the technique. It was her motherfucking ex wife.</p><p>“Mmmhh.” Agatha hummed, slinging an arm over her eyes. “Sorry, sweetheart.”</p><p>“It’s okay.” Wanda’s voice pitched higher, a lie.</p><p>Agatha would let her go for a couple of minutes before faking it and waiting for Wanda to disappear so she could get herself off. Any orgasm not induced by Rio, was due to her own hand or vibrator. Honestly, Wanda might stand a chance in hell in actually wringing an orgasm from Agatha if she clipped those damn talons and used her fingers. Some women didn’t like penetration, Agatha fucking <i>loved</i> it. She loved being full, she loved being <i>fucked</i>. But, Wanda didn’t want to wear a strap or cut two nails shorter, so that thought was a dead end.</p><p>“You want me to keep going?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Um–” Agatha’s phone rang, saving her from having to make the decision. She looked over, Rio’s caller ID lighting up her phone. “Shit, I gotta take this.”</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>“Need I remind you of the last time I ignored my phone and my daughter and ex wife barged in?”</p><p>Wanda stood, completely naked and hair mussed. “I’m going to shower. Join me after?”</p><p>Agatha gave a salute in acknowledgement, watching Wanda disappear into the bathroom and answering the phone. “Yeah?”</p><p>“Did you see the message in the patient portal from Nicky’s therapist?”</p><p>Therapy had been going well, Nicky had been seeing a doctor she really liked for a little less than a month now. The results spoke for themselves, she was less prone to lashing out, she fought Agatha less. Nicky was even able to be in the same room as Wanda and not insult her. Well, not insult her loud enough for Wanda to actually hear. It wasn’t a magical fix, but there was progress.</p><p>“Good morning to you too.”</p><p>“Morning.” Rio said, smiling. Agatha couldn’t see her, but she could still hear her ex wife’s smile crystal clear. That inflection, that tone.</p><p>“No, I didn’t.” Agatha let her free hand rest on her lower abdomen, brushing her scar. “Why, are we in trouble?” She grinned.</p><p>“We’re being asked to come in for her next session.” Rio said, “I think we’re being sent to the principal’s office.”</p><p>“What the fuck did we do?”</p><p>“Who knows, but I’m sure it’s all our fault.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Of course not, the parents are <i>never</i> to blame…”</p><p>“I don’t know, I think we kind of knocked it out of the park with Nicky.”</p><p>“She’s not fully formed yet.”</p><p>“She’s half you, she’ll be fine.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. If they were going by genetics, Nicky was not half Agatha. Nicky was half Rio and half an anonymous donor, but Rio never made it feel that way. And their daughter might be a spitting image of her ex wife, but Nicky’s personality? All Agatha. It’s not like biology was especially important to Agatha given that Lilia had no involvement in her creation, but she was still <i>her mom</i>. Just like Agatha was still Nicky’s mom and had the stretch marks to prove it.</p><p>“Where’s our child now?” Agatha asked, knowing it was Rio’s week.</p><p>“She went to Kamala’s house, they had a sleepover last night.”</p><p>So, their daughter was gone.</p><p>As was Wanda.</p><p>A horrendous, insane, and borderline creepy thought popped into her head. Her hand drifted further, fingers brushing the hair of her mons. Agatha was still worked up, and Rio’s voice was right here…</p><p>“So what did you do with your freedom?” Agatha quipped, pads of her fingers dipping lower.</p><p>“Uh, me and Alice went to a bar and had a few beers.”</p><p>“Mmmhhh.” She hummed, middle finger idly circling her clit. “Sounds riveting.”</p><p>“Oh, you have no clue.” Rio chuckled. “Afterwards, I came home and worked on my new LEGO set.”</p><p>“You animal.” She husked, running her middle and ring fingers through her slit collecting the wetness. “What set?”</p><p>God, is this what her life has become? Secretly jacking off to her ex wife’s voice, conversing about LEGOs just to get off?</p><p>“Five thousand piece Titanic.” Rio obliviously said. “The mast was a bitch.”</p><p>Mast.</p><p>A pole.</p><p>Long, hard, thick.</p><p>Fuck, yeah, this was pathetic.</p><p>She slowly sunk her digits into herself, picturing Rio’s instead. It didn’t mean anything, she was just trying to get herself off. Nothing more. It was better than cheating…right?</p><p>The shower was running, so she knew Wanda was occupied.</p><p>“W-why was it a bitch?” Agatha pumped her fingers. Finally, feeling close to full.</p><p>“It was in a billion tiny pieces, they could’ve made it in a way that just made more sense.”</p><p>Her eyes fluttered shut. “Hey, Rio?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“You remember when we took that cruise? I think Nicky was, like, three.”</p><p>Her ex wife laughed. “Fuck, and you got <i>so</i> sunburned.”</p><p>“Was bright red for a week.” She sped up her hand, canting her hips up.</p><p>“You pulled it off…especially in that bikini.”</p><p>“You kept calling me a MILF.”</p><p>“You were.” A beat of silence. “You <i>are</i>.”</p><p>Agatha curled her fingers, biting her lower lip not to moan. Her other hand clutching the phone like she was trying to strangle the damn thing. This was very morally gray, and for some reason, it only turned her on more.</p><p>“Thank god Jen and Alice went with us, I think they watched Nicky for a quarter of the trip just so we could–” She cut herself off. <i>So we could fuck like bunnies all over that fucking cruise ship.</i></p><p>“Yeah.” Rio agreed, her voice a little hoarse.</p><p>“Yeah.” She breathed out, adding a third finger and keening at the stretch. Her fingers were soaked, her legs were shaking. She was so <i>fucking</i> close. “Pretty sure I lost that bikini top in the Atlantic.”</p><p>“It was offending me.”</p><p>She curled her digits, hitting her g-spot over and over. “Rio.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Her stomach coiled, ready to snap.</p><p>She didn’t say anything, pretty certain her heavy breathing was taking up the conversation. She arched her back, her hand driving.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio’s tone went lethal. “What are <i>you</i> doing right now?”</p><p>“Bed.” She panted, “In bed.”</p><p>“Alone?”</p><p>“Mmmhh.” She confirmed, smothering another moan.</p><p>“And what are you doing…in bed….<i>alone</i>?” Rio knew, of course she fucking knew. She had spent fifteen years memorizing Agatha’s sounds.</p><p>“I- I’m resting.” She said, chest fluttering, breathing uneven.</p><p>“You’re a horrible liar when you’re about to come.”</p><p>“What are you insinuating?”</p><p>“You, my love, are touching yourself.” Her voice went gravelly, deep like it would when she <i>actually did</i> fuck Agatha. “Aren’t you?”</p><p>“You can’t prove that.”</p><p>“How many fingers?”</p><p>Eh, fuck it.</p><p>“Three.”</p><p>“<i>Shit</i>.” Rio whimpered, and Agatha could picture her ex perfectly. Probably in a tank top and boxer, still in her pjs. Maybe in her kitchen brewing coffee, or in bed reading. “What are you wearing?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>Rio must’ve felt physically pained by that, she hadn’t seen Agatha fully naked in years. Not since–</p><p>Well she preferred not to think about that right now.</p><p>It wasn’t that the scar made her insecure, Agatha was hot regardless. It was Rio plus the scar. She didn’t want Rio to look at or touch it, for what reason she couldn’t be sure, but her brain knew it was wrong.</p><p>Agatha was <i>dripping</i>, lewd sounds emitting into the room. “We- we shouldn’t do this.”</p><p>And it made it so much hotter.</p><p>“You started it.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah I did.”</p><p>“You wanna stop?”</p><p>“We <i>should</i> stop.”</p><p>“Not what I asked.” Rio went quiet for a moment before speaking again. “You pretending those fingers are mine?”</p><p>“Don’t ruin it.”</p><p>“C’mon, let me hear one moan.” She could picture Rio’s smirk. “You always sound so pretty.”</p><p>Involuntarily, a moan ripped from her throat. She threw her head back, neck vein popping. “<i>Rio</i>.”</p><p>“That’s it, angel.”</p><p>“Fuck, I gotta be quiet.”</p><p>“She nearby?”</p><p>“Shower.”</p><p>“Remember that time I fucked you in the shower at our old place? You were bent over, fucked out, gripping that bar…absolutely wrecked.”</p><p>“Yeah.” She nodded, reaching that edge, ready to fall.</p><p>“Pretty sure you took my whole fist, you were so <i>fucking</i> tight.”</p><p>She whimpered at the memory, wanting to relive it. “I still am.”</p><p>“Oh I know, querida.” Rio rasped. “You’re always so good, so perfect.”</p><p>“Say it again.”</p><p>“You’re so <i>good</i>.”</p><p>Agatha's body started to convulse. “Oh, fuck–”</p><p>“<i>My good girl</i>.”</p><p>Those words shouldn’t affect her anymore, they should mean zip. Because Agatha wasn’t hers, and Rio wasn’t Agatha’s. Not anymore. Not for years. She was dating someone else, she was having sex with someone else less than ten minutes ago. And yet—</p><p>Agatha dropped the phone, landing with a soft thud against her shoulder as she came. She shuddered as her walls clenched around her fingers, letting out a silent scream so as not to alert her girlfriend in the shower.</p><p>“Baby?” Rio’s voice faintly spoke, the phone languidly sliding into the crook of her neck.</p><p>What the fuck was Agatha doing?</p><p>She just used her ex wife to come.</p><p>And her ex wife was aware.</p><p>With her girlfriend in the fucking shower.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</p><p>She shot up, sliding her fingers out and–</p><p>Shit, they were drenched.</p><p>Dammit, shit, fucking bitch–</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio spoke again.</p><p>Agatha picked up the phone with the one not saturated in her own arousal, clearing her throat. “Sorry.”</p><p>“Sorry?” Rio echoed. “I’m not.”</p><p>“That was fucked up, to say the least.”</p><p>“But you feel better.”</p><p>It wasn’t a question. Rio already knew.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Then there’s nothing to be sorry for.”</p><p>“No, I- I shouldn’t have done that to you. I’m not putting you on hold.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Nothing.” Agatha sniffled, suddenly feeling very vulnerable. “Nothing, I should go.”</p><p>Rio didn’t even try to hide her disappointment. “Oh…okay.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“See you in therapy.”</p><p>Agatha almost laughed at the absurdity of it. “Yeah, see you in therapy.”</p><p>“Bye.”</p><p><i>Wish you were here.</i></p><p><i>Wish it had been you.</i></p><p><i>Wish it was you in that shower.</i></p><p>No. Absolutely not.</p><p>“Bye.”</p><p>Agatha hung up, throwing her phone like it had burned her skin.</p><p>“Babe?” Wanda called out. “You coming?”</p><p>Well, for the first time in a long time–</p><p>Agatha actually had.</p><hr/><p>Rio stared at her phone long after the screen had gone black. She stood in the kitchen, coffee machine beeping to signal her coffee was ready. But her brain didn’t register it, too focused on what the fuck had just happened with her ex wife.</p><p>Was it pathetic that Rio was really turned on right now?</p><p>How could she not be?</p><p>Was it wrong to go upstairs and furiously masturbate to the memory of that call?</p><p>Or was that desperate?</p><p>Agatha had sounded <i>so desperate</i>.</p><p>Which made her wonder what the everliving fuck Wanda was doing to her wife in bed. Yeah, Rio was already more than sure that Wanda couldn’t be what Agatha needed, but seriously? The sex was <i>that</i> bad?</p><p>Nicky wasn’t home…</p><p>Wouldn’t be for hours…</p><p>Eh, fuck it.</p><p>Rio bolted up the stairs, taking them two at a time and rushing into her room. She flung herself down, shoving her hand in her boxers. It was a better alternative to thinking about Agatha probably hopping in the shower with Wanda at this current moment.</p><p>Or whatever the fuck “I’m not keeping you on hold” meant.</p><p>No, instead she thought about that cruise and that bikini and how Agatha must’ve looked working her hand between her thighs. Rio bet she looked so fucking good, she was sure of it.</p><p>She thought about the sounds Agatha made, how Rio could tell she was close just from her breathing pattern. If Rio were there, the orgasm would’ve been better, more intense. Hell, she’d give her more than one.</p><p>And Rio wished she didn’t feel this fucking pathetic, didn’t feel this way about a woman who had no fucking interest in her. But then her mind reeled, replacing the guilt and the shame with Agatha. Agatha moaning and whining, whimpering and arching. Agatha’s face, her body.</p><p>Stupid fucking Wanda, she’s not worthy of seeing Agatha naked. That ginger obviously does not know what she’s doing, Agatha deserved better.</p><p>And then Agatha apologized after, like it was a bad thing.</p><p>Yes, Rio was taking scraps, but there wouldn’t be any scraps if Agatha was actually satisfied.</p><p>She gave that relationship two more months before Agatha got  too frustrated to pretend any longer. Rio could wait. She’d always wait for her wife.</p><p>Rio came in under three minutes, hand buried in her boxers, cursing a single name as she did so. “<i>Agatha.</i>”</p><p>The next day, Sunday, Rio and Nicky met Agatha at the therapist’s practice. Their daughter didn’t hug Agatha, but she did smile, so that was progress.</p><p>“Can I throw my bag in your car, mom?” NIcky asked, backpack slung over her shoulder. They figured since it was Sunday, Nicky would just go home with Agatha after the session.</p><p>Agatha handed her the keys. “Sure, hon.”</p><p>It was December and the parking lot was freezing, but that wouldn’t stop Rio. “How was your weekend?” She asked, grinning.</p><p>“Fine.” Agatha said, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>“Get good <i>rest</i>?”</p><p>“Rio.” She warned.</p><p>“I know I did, I think I <i>rested</i> three times after our call.”</p><p>Her ex wife’s pupils dilated, her breath hitching. “Good for you.”</p><p>Sick freak, Agatha was definitely turned on.</p><p>“You know, when I find that <i>resting</i> by myself is easier than <i>resting</i> with another person, I tend to analyze why that might be.” Rio smirked. “Maybe it’s a sign.”</p><p>“And who the fuck have you <i>rested</i> with lately?” Agatha narrowed her gaze in disbelief.</p><p>No one, literally not a single soul.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t know that.</p><p>And this could speed up Ronald McDonald getting the fuck out of the way so Rio could have her wife back.</p><p>After all, Agatha had always been a pretty jealous spouse. Not that she needed to be, Rio never so much as looked at another woman while they were married. Honestly, she still hadn’t. She was <i>stuck</i>.</p><p>“No one serious.”</p><p>“You’re dating?”</p><p>“I don’t know if one night stands count as dating, but…”</p><p>Bald faced lie.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes quickly shifted from lust to rage, maybe envy. “Nicky hasn’t said anything.”</p><p>“I’m not going to tell my daughter when I’m getting laid.”</p><p>“Well…” Agatha crossed her arms, blue winter coat on her body. “Happy you’ve moved on.”</p><p>“Figured it’s time.” Rio’s smile was sickeningly sweet. “Time to find <i>my</i>  Wanda…since you two are <i>so</i> happy.”</p><p>“Fuck you.”</p><p>“Name a time and place, baby.”</p><p>Agatha took a step forward. “I’m going to choke you out, so help me god.”</p><p>Rio leaned in, their respective spaces vanishing until they were almost flush with one another. “Please do.”</p><p>Agatha's car a few rows away beeped, Nicky having locked it with the key fob. “Okay!” Nicky called over. “Let’s do this shit.”</p><p>Agatha sobered at their daughter’s voice, taking a step back. “Yeah.”</p><p>Rio nodded, ignoring the longing that had calcified in her chest years ago. “Yay. Therapy.”</p>
