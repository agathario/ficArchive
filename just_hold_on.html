<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha startles awake at the feeling of an elbow in her ribs and nearly falls out of her seat.</p><p>“<em>Jesus</em>, Sharon, keep your hands to yourself,” she snaps under her breath, and Sharon gives her a look.</p><p>“You're snoring,” she whispers back. “I'm trying to hear the panel. Also, people are staring.”</p><p>Agatha rakes her hand through her hair, shoving messy locks off her face. She hadn't wanted to come here in the first place, let alone sit through another godawful panel about the importance of <em> meeting your students where they're at </em> or <em> trauma-informed interpretations of social dynamics in the classroom </em> or <em> conducting effective office hours </em>or whatever other 101 bullshit programming they'd scraped together this year.</p><p>Ed Con was generally a bunch of bullshit – a convention where professors across the country would come together for 4 days to share best practices and suck each other's dicks before disappearing back to their books. Unfortunately for Agatha, this convention is a necessary evil.</p><p>Alas, the panels haven't gotten any more interesting in the two years since Agatha last went to one of these things. Sue her if she takes a nap. Professors are famously overworked, this audience should get it.</p><p>One of the panelists gives her a mean look, and Agatha rolls her eyes. Jennifer Kale – professor of obstetric medicine at Johns Hopkins, former fling, and major pain in the ass. Agatha and Jen had met in college, hooked up for a while when they'd had overlapping adjunct gigs at Swarthmore in their youth, then again when they'd run into each other at Ed Con a few years prior.</p><p>But Agatha had ended it by saying something mean about Jen selling out when Jen ditched academia for a couple years to do a recurring Dr. Oz-esque pseudo-science segment on daytime TV. This, Agatha finds a reasonable explanation for not liking her. But Jen's real issue came from the fact that Agatha had fucked her girlfriend, Alice – before Alice and Jen had ever met, mind you, but after the selling out argument – and Agatha finds that a much less respectable reason to dislike her. Needless to say they aren't on the best of terms.</p><p>Agatha gives Jen a little wave, wiggling her fingers and blowing a kiss, and Jen rolls her eyes.</p><p>Another panelist is giving an answer to an audience question – thank God, they're at the Q&amp;A part of this panel – and Sharon is taking dutiful notes as though she's receiving instructions from the good Lord Himself, rather than getting basic information about a career she's been in for thirty years.</p><p>“I'm gonna go piss,” Agatha hisses at Sharon, and slips out of her seat before the other woman can stop her.</p><p>Jen's glaring at her as she leaves. Whatever. It's Sharon's fault they were sitting close enough to the front for it to be a disruption, anyways – and Agatha already resents that bitch for being tenured and in a field that has somehow endured every layoff and funding cut Agatha's ever seen.</p><p>Alice is in the bathroom when Agatha opens the door, because the world is a cruel place.</p><p>"Hey, Agatha,” Alice throws her way as she disappears into a stall, and Agatha is irked by whatever social impulse is compelling the other woman to strike up conversation with her.</p><p>"Hi, Alice. How's your Ed Con going?"</p><p>She hopes her flat tone will discourage further conversation as she yanks down her pants to piss. Alas, Alice was always the nicer of the Wu-Gulliver-Kale duo.</p><p>"It's going well! Have you had a chance to walk the floor yet? There's a neat booth about this new curriculum-building software – I don't remember what it's called."</p><p>"I figured the floor was taken over with shitty A.I. by now."</p><p>Alice snorts. "No, just our students' papers."</p><p>"Kill me now if this is the future of academia." Agatha finishes her business and exits to the sinks to wash her hands. Alice leans on the counter next to her, looking exactly as Agatha remembered her, but with the green streaks in her hair traded out for red.</p><p>"Have you seen any good panels, at least?"</p><p>Agatha purses her lips. "I just got out of one led by your lovely wife. Congrats, by the way." She nods her head at the sparkly rock on Alice's hand. Alice tries and fails to contain a grin.</p><p>"Thanks, Agatha. For what it's worth, I wanted to invite you, but… well, you know Jen."</p><p>"I do know Jen. That's probably why it's best I wasn't anywhere near that."</p><p>"She doesn't hate you <em> that </em>much."</p><p>Agatha gives Alice a look as she grabs too-many paper towels. "I think I might know your wife better than you do if you really think that."</p><p>"We've talked about you, Agatha. We both want the best for you."</p><p>"Yeah? Is Johns Hopkins hiring or have you and Jen filled their quota for lesbian feminist bullshit?"</p><p>The dean's face still burns in her mind, imprinted on the back of her eyelids. His smug, unbothered, fake pity as he told her that they were making <em> strategic funding cuts </em>and that no one actually cared about her or her program enough to keep it.</p><p>Fuck him. Fuck him for firing her, fuck him for cowing to the idiots in charge of the budget and their funding, fuck him for listening to too many right wing asshats on Twitter.</p><p>And fuck him especially for leaving Ed Con as Agatha's only real chance to keep full-time employment in academia rather than going back to adjuncting – or God forbid, stepping foot in a high school. She think she's better off killing herself before it gets to that point. Fuck him for leaving her with one shining chance to schmooze and network and worm her way into another job.</p><p>Alice's face twists into an expression of pity, which makes Agatha briefly contemplate accelerating those "killing herself" plans. "Are you applying?"</p><p>"Yes, Alice, I will answer the question you're too nice to ask. I was fired. And no, before you make any assumptions, it wasn't because of my abrasive personality or any fun scandal. It was entirely because Dean Bohner would prefer to kiss the asses of racists and misogynists online than reconsider our budget."</p><p>"I'm sorry," Alice says, and fuck Dean Bohner most of all for subjecting Agatha to others' <em> pity </em>. "That really sucks."</p><p>"Yeah," she says. "Well. If you hear of any openings, let me know."</p><p>"I might," Alice says. "I'll text you. Is your number the same?"</p><p>Agatha resists a laugh at the memory of how Alice <em> got </em>said number – both of them wasted several Ed Cons ago, hooking up in the bathroom of a nearby grimy dive bar where a group of professors had gone to get drunk at the end of the conference – and instead just nods. "That'll do it." She feels awkward at the offer of help. "Thanks." The word burns in her mouth.</p><p>"If it helps, I'm sure you'll find something soon," Alice says. "You're too good not to." She sighs. "I better get back to Jen's panel."</p><p>"You're hiding in the bathroom because it's fucking boring, aren't you?" Agatha asks, squinting at her, and Alice gives a mock offended look.</p><p>"How dare you," she says, and Agatha cackles.</p><p>"Have a good Ed Con, Alice,” she says, and sweeps back out of the room.</p><p>She follows Alice out and they head in different directions down the hallway – Alice back to Jen's panel, and Agatha towards the escalator.</p><p>Exhibitor booths crowd the bottom floor of the convention center, each one belonging to new software company or university and staffed by whatever poor sucker on their respective team had drawn the short straw. Walking the floor at least is a better option than listening to Jen ramble.</p><p>There's a VR booth (there's <em> always </em>a VR booth) and Agatha pretends to be more interested than she is just to get a free demo. They tell her some shit about it being an immersive learning experience while she settles the goggles over her eyes, as though students wouldn't immediately use this to fuck around during class. She hums passively throughout their pitch. When they tell her about the A.I. writing assistant they're working on adding to their next update, she changes the system language to something with a Cyrillic alphabet and takes them off.</p><p>"Thanks so much," she says with a false smile, "but unfortunately, these are ugly as fuck."</p><p>She's off before they can process her words, ducking down another aisle and pretending to look very interested at the first table she sees.</p><p>"Hi!" says the woman sitting behind the table, sitting up straighter. "I'm–"</p><p>"Listen, I'm not interested in…" Agatha squints at the hundreds of pamphlets decorating the table. "Whatever this is. Sorry to disappoint."</p><p>The woman deflates slightly, and Agatha lifts her gaze from the table to get a proper look at her.</p><p>She's <em> stunning </em>in a way that instantly gets Agatha's attention – big brown eyes, thick brown hair half clipped back from her face, a fading smile with the slightest gap between her front teeth.</p><p>Agatha almost feels bad about being rude. <em> Almost. </em></p><p>"I'm Rio," the woman tries valiantly. "I'm here to–"</p><p>"That's nice," Agatha says, picking up a random pamphlet and waving it at her. "I'm sure I can read all about it."</p><p>Rio huffs, pressing her tongue against the inside of her cheek in an attractive little move. "Fine." She slouches back in her chair. "It's a good pitch though."</p><p>"I'm sure." Agatha folds the pamphlet in half and shoves it in the back pocket of her jeans, scanning the room to make sure none of those A.I. assholes are coming for her. A factor she hadn’t considered about unemployment was how important reputation became when trying to get hired. <em> Annoying </em>. When she looks back down at Rio, the other woman has tilted her head like a puppy and is giving her a quizzical look. "What?"</p><p>"Do I know you?"</p><p>Agatha freezes, then forces herself to breathe out of her nose. "I doubt it."</p><p>“I swear you look so familiar.”</p><p>Agatha crosses her arms, then gives Rio a look meant to distract her from this line of questioning. “If we'd met before… I'd remember.”</p><p>Rio flushes a pretty shade of red, and Agatha can't help the satisfied smile that quirks up the corner of her mouth. “Well. Ah. Thank you.”</p><p>Agatha snorts. "Very smooth." She runs her tongue over the edge of her teeth and watches as dark eyes track the movement. She huffs out a laugh and Rio’s eyes widen and jump back up to hers. “I'll catch you around, <em> Rio </em>.”</p><p>“Are you–”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t let her finish, strutting off instead. “Enjoy the convention.” When she glances back, Rio’s eyes are tracking the sway of her hips.</p><p>By the time Alice texts Agatha letting her know that a group of them are meeting up at a local bar for a drink, Agatha is more than exhausted – and more than ready to get drunk off her ass from shots of bottom shelf liquor. She's also in the market for a cute girl to take home if there's one around. The college had cheaped out on hotels, and Agatha can think of few things worse than sleeping on a twin bed across the room from Sharon Davis’ snoring.</p><p>She isn't thinking when she flags down the bartender for a drink, which is why she's slow to notice Jen standing beside her until she bumps shoulders with her and Jen snaps, "Watch it, Harkness."</p><p>Agatha jumps. "Jesus, Jen. You're like the worst kind of fucking ghost."</p><p>Jen gives her a thin, false smile. "And yet <em> you're </em> the one who won't stop haunting <em> me </em>. Why are you here?"</p><p>"Your lovely wife invited me," Agatha shot back, returning her smile with a put-on, lascivious one of her own. "What, she didn't tell you? We reconnected in the bathroom earlier today."</p><p>Jen's eyes flash with anger, and Agatha resists a laugh. Too easy.</p><p>"She did mention that, actually," Jen grits out. "She said you were fired."</p><p>It's Agatha's turn to purse her lips in irritation. "Fired is a bit dramatic."</p><p>"No? So if I called up good ol' Dean Bohner, he'd tell me how gainfully employed you are?"</p><p>Agatha fumes. Jen laughs at the way the muscle in her jaw ticks.</p><p>"How the mighty have fallen, Professor Agatha Harkness. It's sad, really."</p><p>And Agatha can do petty insults but she cannot do this smug little pity thing. "Fuck you, Jennifer."</p><p>Jen leans back in her bar stool, content to have won this round. Agatha stews for a minute, sipping her drink through a tiny stirring straw.</p><p>"How are you, Agatha?" Jen asks, her voice softer this time. Apparently she's fine to play nice now that she's had her fun. "Really, I mean."</p><p>"Bad," Agatha says shortly, refusing eye contact. "You know it's bad."</p><p>"I'd hoped-"</p><p>"Hoped what, exactly, Jen?" Agatha snaps, and that silences Jen, which probably means a little too much real hurt snuck into her voice. Agatha bites the inside of her cheek hard. "How are you and Alice?"</p><p>"We're happy, Agatha. We're really happy." Her voice is low in that way that tells Agatha there's something she's not saying, and where once Agatha would've pried, she's too stubborn now to give Jen the satisfaction of asking follow up questions. </p><p>She's saved by someone squealing her name, and before she can turn around to see who it is, a pair of slender pale arms wrap around her neck and pull her into a hug.</p><p>Well. There's only one person Agatha can imagine would try to hug her at this point.</p><p>"Wanda," she says weakly, turning just enough to get a mouthful of red hair. "It's so good to see you."</p><p>"I've missed you so much!" Wanda exclaims, and Agatha forces a smile as the other woman pulls back. Wanda Maximoff – the rare former conquest turned friend – had been working at a think tank in D.C. writing reports on domestic policy when Agatha met her. Wanda had reached out about a book Agatha had written, calling it a <em> seminal piece of constructivist theory </em>, whatever that had meant. They’d hooked up on and off for a few years – an entirely unattached friends with benefits thing – until Wanda had met the most boring man alive – sorry, the love of her life – at a tech conference. When Wanda went into academia, she'd clung to Agatha like a sweet yet annoying barnacle, clearly hoping Agatha would mentor her and going with the flow remarkably well when Agatha had expressed how much that was not something she cared to do.</p><p>"You look good," Agatha says, and it's true. Wanda has a suspicious sort of glow about her. If it's anything Vision-related – god forbid if they bought a house or some other lovely little domestic milestone – Agatha will throw up. The only advice Wanda had ever managed to pry out of Agatha was "Don't date a blonde man" and Wanda had promptly ignored that one straight off.</p><p>"You do look good," Jen agrees, and Wanda gives another squeal and attacks Jen with a massive hug.</p><p>"Jen! I swear I haven't seen you or Alice since the wedding."</p><p>"We've been busy," Jen says, grinning, probably because Wanda will clearly entertain her with all the meaningless questions that Jen could ever want.</p><p>"Tell me everything. How was the honeymoon? God, I'm so jealous – the pictures were STUNNING. How many countries did you go to exactly? I swear you were out of the country for, like, a full year."</p><p>"Just about," Jen says, and Agatha flags down the bartender for another drink before Jen can launch into a detailed explanation of her vacation. She's mostly through her second drink when Jen wraps up. "Should we move to a table while we wait for the others?"</p><p>Lilia is next, fingers predictably drenched in a collection of silver rings that look heavier every time Agatha sees them, and she is at least a more welcome presence. She blows air kisses at all of them and claims she doesn't plan to stay for more than two drinks, though the fact that she shows up to the table already holding two espresso martinis in her hands begs to differ.</p><p>She regales them with an amusing tale of how she dressed down one of her students for using A.I. on the final essay for one of her higher level classes on classical myths and folklore – complete with references to an entirely nonexistent fable that the A.I. had invented.</p><p>By the time she gets to the end of her story, everyone's wheezing a little from laughter, and Agatha's feeling pleasantly flushed and dizzy from the drinks that have continued to flow.</p><p>This is when Alice chooses to appear, pushing through a crowd to get there, looking incredibly annoyed and incredibly sober.</p><p>"You're late," Agatha accuses too loudly, even as Jen lights up and Wanda screams again, jumping up to hug her.</p><p>"I'm so sorry, I got stuck in the worst fucking conversation – you know what, it doesn't matter. We're here! And I brought a friend." Alice takes Wanda's spot next to Jen to give her wife a peck on the cheek, and Wanda shrieks yet again to greet their newcomer. Agatha smiles at Alice, mostly to piss Jen off. "Agatha, I don't know if you've met her. This is–”</p><p>"Rio," Agatha interrupts, as Wanda backs off enough to reveal the brunette.</p><p>Rio waves awkwardly. "Hey."</p><p>"You've met?" Alice asks, and Rio shakes her head.</p><p>"Not… exactly." She holds out a hand to Agatha. "Rio Vidal."</p><p>And Agatha's a little pissed about how hot she looks, a little pissed that Alice hadn't given her any warning, a little pissed that she's multiple more drinks along than Rio, but she presses her lips together and ignores Rio's hand.</p><p>"We met earlier," she says simply, dragging her eyes up and down Rio's form. She hasn't changed out of her outfit from the conference, but a few more buttons have come undone on her crisp blue button down and she retucks her hands into the pockets of her khaki slacks at Agatha's refusal of the one she'd extended, leaving her thumbs out. She's pulled the rest of her hair back up into her claw clip, abandoning the half-up style she'd worn earlier, and Agatha considers the open expanse of her neck before snapping herself out of it. "I didn't realize you were friends with… this group."</p><p>Rio gives a toothy grin, sliding next to Alice and Jen and making Wanda switch sides to sit next to Lilia. "I worked with Alice and Jen for a while," she says, tucking a loose strand of her bangs back behind her ear. The movement makes her ear piercings catch in the light – a silver industrial catches Agatha's eye and has no right being as attractive as it is.</p><p>"We'd love to have her back," Jen says meaningfully, leaning in to give Rio a look, and Rio gives a light laugh.</p><p>"Thanks, Jen, but the position you have open isn't what I'm looking for at the moment." She looks back up at Agatha. "How about you? How'd you meet everyone?"</p><p>"We don't need to get into all that," Jen says, and Agatha gives her a begrudging and silent thanks for saving them the awkward conversation. "Let's just say we can't seem to shake her loose."</p><p>"Your wife invited <em> me </em>, Kale," Agatha reminds her.</p><p>“I’m not accountable for her lapses in judgment,” Jen shoots back, and Alice gives a little ‘hey!’ in protest. “Sorry, baby, I didn’t mean it.”</p><p>Agatha fakes a gag. “Jeez, you’re whipped.” Rio snorts from across the table.</p><p>“And how’s your love life, Agatha?” Wanda asks, giving a smile clearly meant to deescalate. “Anyone we should know about?”</p><p>“If there were someone you should know about, you’d know about her.” Agatha shrugs. She pretends not to pay attention to Rio’s reaction to the pronoun drop, but she catalogues the way Rio’s cheeks pinken and she focuses on her drink.</p><p>Rio’s booth had been for some kind of organization, too – not a school. That bodes well for what kind of hotel room she probably had. Agatha wouldn’t mind passing out on a king bed tonight.</p><p>“How about you, Rio?” Wanda asks.</p><p>Alice laughs and wraps an arm around Rio, answering for her. “Oh, you mean the most eligible bachelorette on the east coast? I’ve only tried to set Rio up with every person I know.”</p><p>Rio groans, dropping her face into her hands.</p><p>“Clearly it’s going well,” Agatha comments, and Rio lifts her head again.</p><p>“It’s… so well intentioned,” she says diplomatically, and Agatha snorts. “Seriously, Alice, I love you. But I can’t take one more godawful date.”</p><p>“Someday we’ll find someone you’re interested in,” Alice says, and Agatha swears she’s not imagining the way Rio’s eyes flick up to meet hers for a second before jerking away.</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio mumbles, her voice taking an embarrassed sort of tone. She drains the beer she’s successfully peeled the label off of and twists in her seat to look for someone she can flag down for another.</p><p>“Your track record is horrible,” Lilia says, pointing the neck of her own bottle at Alice. “Well-intentioned is the best we can say. Who was the last person you set up successfully?”</p><p>”I think the closest you got was me and Agatha,” Wanda says, and Agatha’s eyes flash.</p><p>”That was a set up?”</p><p>Wanda’s brow creases. “You didn’t know?”</p><p>Alice flushes. “Listen, I knew Agatha would <em> never </em>agree to go out with someone if she knew I was behind it. We got creative.”</p><p>”Who’s <em> we </em>?” Agatha demands, and Alice looks over at Jen as though her wife could say anything that would bail her out. </p><p>“Listen, we just recommended that Wanda read your book,” Jen says, raising her hands. “Whatever happened from there is entirely down to the two of you.”</p><p>“And what <em> did </em> happen?” Rio asks. Agatha forgets her irritation for a minute to quirk an eyebrow at her interjection.</p><p>“Curious, Vidal?”</p><p>Rio blushes again. Agatha feels vaguely feral about the things she would do to keep seeing that embarrassed flush on her cheeks.</p><p>“Agatha and I hooked up for a while,” Wanda says, oblivious to the moment that had just passed beside her. “Before I met Vision.” She gives Agatha an apologetic look. “I should’ve told you that Jen had sent me your way. Your book was <em> everything </em> though. That was sincere. Completely made me rethink my research. Did I ever tell you I almost went back to grad school over it?”</p><p>Agatha makes a face. “Voluntarily taking classes again?”</p><p>“Agatha, you have two different doctoral degrees.” Rio’s eyebrows shoot up at this, and Agatha resists a smirk.</p><p>“One’s a J.D., though, which barely counts. And I was young. You couldn’t pay me to go back as a student today.” She spins the tiny stirrer around the bottom of her glass, rattling the rapidly melting ice pieces together.</p><p>“Me neither,” Alice chips in. “I much prefer to be on this side of the desk.”</p><p>”Agatha was always better at being the troublemaker,” Jen says, in a voice that could only be mustered by someone who had known Agatha for far, far too long. Agatha shoots her a grin.</p><p>“Only the fun kind of trouble.” She punctuates with a look over in Rio’s direction.</p><p>“Right,” Lilia says, voice dripping in sarcasm. “That was definitely <em> my </em> impression of you.”</p><p>“You loved me,” Agatha argues, nudging Lilia’s shoulder.</p><p>“You wouldn’t stop hitting on me during office hours,” Lilia retorts, though she can’t fight the affectionate smile that creeps across her mouth.</p><p>Agatha snorts before she can stop herself. “I was a grad student. You weren’t even my professor. Forgive me for being into the whole crazy witch thing.”</p><p>“None of that makes it feel more ethical, Agatha,” Lilia reprimands.</p><p>“Is there anyone we know that you <em> haven’t </em>tried to sleep with?” Jen asks pointedly, sipping her own drink.</p><p>“Well, sweet Rio and I have only just met,” Agatha says, running her tongue over her teeth and shooting Rio a wink – more to irritate Jen than anything else, but Rio flushes red again.</p><p>“Absolutely not,” Jen says, waving her drink between them. “Abs- Rio, are you listening to me? Absolutely not.” She turns, leaning across Alice to look Rio seriously in the eye – or as seriously as she can this many drinks in. “Do not let Agatha get her fuckin’ claws in you, okay? Love her to death but I need one friend who isn’t under her… insane spell.” She waves a hand at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha beams. “Awww. She said she loves me.”</p><p>Jen groans. “Ugh. Gross. Rio. I’m so serious. Baby Rio. Please.”</p><p>Rio gives Agatha a look that makes Agatha’s head spin, all dark eyes through dark lashes. “I need another drink if we’re continuing this conversation,” she announces, slipping out of the booth, and Agatha pounces.</p><p>”Me, too,” she says, crawling over Lilia and Wanda with significantly less grace to stand next to Rio. She manages not to trip, which is an accomplishment that feels incredibly important as Rio’s eyes refuse to leave her.</p><p>Jen opens her mouth like she’s about to say something but Alice whips around to look at her before she can, conveying something that shuts her up. Agatha leans in close to Rio’s ear. “Lead the way, pretty girl.”</p><p>Rio’s next breath is unsteady but she complies, weaving through the now-crowded room to lean against the bar. She turns to make room for Agatha, and Agatha takes it, pressing too close to her.</p><p>”You were quiet back there,” Agatha says. She keeps her voice too low for the atmosphere, in hopes of making Rio lean closer to hear her. Rio, beautiful Rio, falls for it immediately. A lock of her hair brushes Agatha’s cheek and Agatha can smell her shampoo. Tea tree. She’s struck by a sudden urge to run her fingers through it, weave through the thick locks and tug. She wonders if Rio would like that. She thinks she would.</p><p>She’s too distracted to realize that Rio has said something. “Sorry?”</p><p>”I was asking what you’d said,” Rio responds with a half-laugh.</p><p>”I said you were quiet back at the table,” Agatha says. She lets one corner of her mouth drift up into a smirk. “I would’ve loved to hear more about you, beautiful.”</p><p>Rio blushes and Agatha lets her eyes drop intentionally to Rio’s full bottom lip. Rio licks her lips and Agatha watches her with a building hunger, the sheen of spit that her tongue leaves behind.</p><p>“So <em> now </em> you want my pitch,” Rio says. “Pamphlet not enough for you?” <em> Good.  </em>This is good. She’s regaining her footing. Agatha wants to consume Rio, wants to know her game, wants to see her confident and throw her off-balance anyways.</p><p>“Oh, I’m much more interested in info about your extracurricular offerings,” Agatha purrs back.</p><p>RIo’s cheeks get impossibly redder but she doesn’t fluster. ”Jen was right to warn me about you.” Her eyes drift away from Agatha’s and she holds up two fingers to flag down the bartender. “What are you drinking?”</p><p>”At this point? I’ll drink whatever.” Agatha pauses. Grimaces. “<em> Not </em>beer. No offense.”</p><p>Rio laughs and orders a Modelo for herself and a margarita for Agatha.</p><p>”Tequila? Now I <em> know </em>you’re trying to get in my pants.”</p><p>This throws her off again, to Agatha’s endless delight. “I’m sorry- I didn’t-“</p><p>”Play it cool, Vidal. I didn’t say I didn’t like it.”</p><p>Rio sticks her tongue in her cheek but holds her tongue until the bartender returns. She slides cash across the bar and grabs both drinks, jerking her head back in the direction of their booth.</p><p>”Paying for my drink? You sure know how to sweep a girl off her feet.”</p><p>“I figure so long as you’ve got a drink, your mouth can’t keep getting us in trouble.” Rio winces at her own accidental double entendre, and Agatha throws her head back and cackles.</p><p>”Oh, I’ll show you how much trouble this mouth can get into.”</p><p>“I think I got a pretty good sense of the kind of trouble you get into back at the table,” Rio says, and Agatha flashes her a grin.</p><p>“We’re in academia, honey. Don’t tell me you’re settling for secondary sources instead of doing your own first-person research.”</p><p>Rio makes an amused humming noise in the back of her throat. Agatha wants her so badly it’s almost annoying.</p><p>Lilia is leaving when they make it back to the table. “Presentation first thing in the morning,” she says. “If I don’t see you all there, I’ll be offended.”</p><p>”You’ll be the first good speaker at this conference,” Agatha says, ignoring Jen’s mock-offended protest to bat her eyelashes dramatically at Lilia. Lilia rolls her eyes.</p><p>”That kind of flattery didn’t work on me twenty years ago and it won’t work now, Harkness. I’ll see you bright and early.”</p><p>Agatha presses a platonic farewell kiss to Lilia’s cheek with zero intention of getting up early to see her old friend speak.</p><p>One thing leads to another, as they often do with this group. Someone suggests shots, someone else suggests never have I ever, and Agatha’s pretty sure she’s only responsible for one of those suggestions.</p><p>“Never have I ever hooked up with a coworker,” Wanda says, holding up her hands innocently, and Alice, Jen, and Agatha all groan at the targeted question and sip their drinks. Rio doesn’t drink. She’s so fucking pretty. Agatha’s too drunk to stop the thought.</p><p>“Never have I ever…” Agatha considers. “Never have I ever… Jesus, I’ve done everything.” She eyes Wanda’s glass, still full. Her drink is clear and iceless and it occurs to Agatha that she has no idea what the fuck the redhead is drinking. “Never have I ever slept with a man.”</p><p>Wanda pouts but drinks. “This is targeted biphobia, just so you know.”</p><p>Agatha tunes out a little when Jen starts talking, hemming and hawing over what to say. It’s an easy thing to slip one foot free of her heel and reach out across the table until she meets warm flesh. Rio’s ankle. She nuzzles her toe against the bone of the other woman’s ankle then drags it up her calf, just enough to tease.</p><p>She doesn’t look for Rio’s reaction though, won’t give up the game that easily. Jen finally settles on something – something about anal, maybe? Agatha really wasn’t listening – and Agatha drinks because, well, <em> probably. </em></p><p>“Never have I ever used a sex swing,” Alice says, and when Agatha drinks, Rio does too. Agatha raises her eyebrows in impressed surprise and Rio gives her a coy smile. Agatha’s foot drifts higher.</p><p>“Never have I ever taken strap,” Rio says, almost casually, and Agatha nearly spits her drink across the table.</p><p>“<em> Never?” </em> she chokes out, and Rio laughs.</p><p>“I’m usually the giver.”</p><p>Oh, Agatha needs this woman to fuck her through a mattress. Rio runs her tongue across the front of her teeth and gives Agatha a look that says she’s thinking the same thing.</p><p>“Agatha, what the fuck are you doing?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snap back over to Alice’s. “Huh?”</p><p>“You’re, like, trying to footfuck me under the table.” Alice shifts, and the warm skin beneath Agatha’s foot moves. Fuck.</p><p>“Um.” Agatha blinks. Rio snorts.</p><p>“I’m going to the bathroom,” she announces, and Agatha gives some excuse that she can’t even bother to make convincing before getting up and following her.</p><p>The door isn’t even shut before Agatha’s on her, pressing Rio up against the door and kissing her hungrily. It’s electric. Rio’s a little sweaty from the drinks and the crowds, and Agatha tangles her fingers in the hair at the nape of Rio’s neck and wants to lick the salt off the side of her jugular. Rio gasps into Agatha’s mouth and gives as good as she gets, flickering her tongue over Agatha’s top lip and moaning when Agatha bites down on her own lip.</p><p>Agatha vaguely registers Rio’s hand leaving her side to fumble for the lock on the bathroom door, but it’s back on her in a second. She can feel Rio attempting to slip her fingers under Agatha’s shirt, an effort foiled by the fact that Agatha’s shirt is tucked into her pants. Agatha laughs at this until Rio honest-to-god <em> growls </em>, yanking at Agatha’s top until it pulls free and she can finally press her palm against Agatha’s waist, fingers digging in just enough to send a jolt down Agatha’s spine.</p><p>Her hands are big, and warm, and Agatha wants her to do some truly horrible things with them.</p><p>Rio slips her thigh between Agatha’s and Agatha’s vision goes blurry as she grinds down. Rio bites her own lip as she pulls back to watch the movement, and Agatha throws back her head to give her a show, her hair cascading over her shoulders, exposing the line of her neck. Rio leans in again and presses her lips to Agatha’s pulse point. Agatha’s eyes flutter shut as she presses into Rio’s warmth, and–</p><p>A stall door slams open, and someone says, “Jesus!”</p><p>Right.</p><p>This is not, in fact, a single-stall bathroom.</p><p>Rio and Agatha stay like that, frozen, as a woman emerges from a stall, washes her hands, and approaches them.</p><p>“Can I get out?” she asks in a snippy little voice. “You’ve locked me in.”</p><p>Rio has the dignity to look embarrassed as they shuffle out of the way. Agatha can’t bring herself to muster anything greater than extreme irritation at being interrupted.</p><p>“Can you unlock the door?” The woman rolls her eyes. “I literally just washed my hands.”</p><p>Rio does as she says.</p><p>Once she’s gone, Agatha lets out a loud cackle. “Do you always take instructions that well?”</p><p>Rio huffs in a clear attempt to cover up her own laugh. “We fucking locked a stranger in the bathroom, Agatha.”</p><p>“Whatever. She seemed like a bitch.”</p><p>“You’re awful,” Rio says, but she can’t hide her grin anymore.</p><p>“Do something about it, then,” Agatha says, and Rio does, reclaiming Agatha’s lips with her own.</p><p>“I have a king bed back in my hotel room,” Rio murmurs against Agatha’s mouth, and Agatha moans. Fuck, she loves dumb companies and their stupid expensive choices. “If you want.”</p><p>“If I want? Jesus Christ, Rio.” Rio’s mouth drops to Agatha’s neck again and Agatha gasps at the sensation. “D-” She swallows her own words as Rio sucks, hard, and has to restart. “Does your hotel have breakfast included?”</p><p>Rio pulls back to give her a look, and Agatha has a flash of panic – a momentary lapse of thinking she’s blown this. But Rio just laughs and kisses her again. “You’re ridiculous. Let’s go.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Rio’s hotel is nuts.</p><p>This is a thought Agatha has three separate times – first, when their Uber pulls up to the building and Agatha has to peel herself off of her position unsafely straddling Rio’s lap to gawk up at the high-rise; then, in the elevator, when Agatha’s head knocks back against the glass wall to give Rio access to suck marks across her collarbones, her shirt unbuttoning further and further with each passing minute, and Agatha gets an eyeful of gold-gilded coffers on the ceiling of the fucking elevator; and for a third time, when Rio lets them into what is not the penthouse suite but may as fucking well be, with a massive bed, floor to ceiling windows looking out over the city, and a waterfall shower.</p><p>“Do you want a drink?” Rio asks, suddenly polite, and Agatha snaps her mouth shut and considers it as though it’s a reasonable thing to ask when they were three seconds away from fucking in the Uber.</p><p>Fortunately, Rio doesn’t wait for a response, grabbing something out of the minibar. It’s a few things, actually – Jesus Christ, Rio is making them <em> mixed drinks </em>out of the goddamn minibar – and Agatha avoids being too obvious about watching Rio’s hands by snooping around her hotel room instead for a moment before claiming a spot on Rio’s bed. It puts her behind Rio, which feels suddenly safer somehow, as though Rio not being able to watch Agatha drink in the sight of her makes her in any way less vulnerable for doing it.</p><p>“What were you like in school?” Rio asks, rinsing out two of the glasses by the sink before pouring drinks for the both of them. Agatha’s eyes follow the strong line of her shoulders. “You started to answer back at the bar but that conversation sorta… derailed.”</p><p>She must mean college, but Agatha can’t stop the image of herself in high school that flashes to her mind, all sharp elbows and mean barbs and ribs that poked through her skin more than they should’ve. She wasn’t bullied, not really, more just ignored by the other kids like someone’s shitty dog who’d been beat up before and didn’t know how to be around humans anymore so everyone crossed the road rather than walk too close to the yard she was chained up in. She snarled and snapped like a dog, too, always safer to show off how big her bark was than let anyone near enough to realize there wasn’t much of an accompanying bite. Teachers generally knew something was up, she reeked of an unforgiving home life, but even they stopped trying to intervene after the first time Evanora had gotten her claws into one of them when Agatha was just a freshman, a fourteen year old who’d made the mistake of believing in an idea as foolish as a “trusted adult.”</p><p>“I bet you were one of those girls who was too cool for school,” Rio continues, oblivious. “You’re that intimidating sort of pretty.” She turns around and passes Agatha a glass.</p><p>“Not quite,” Agatha says, and Rio blinks at her, all doe eyes and innocence, and Agatha wishes they were kissing again instead of whatever this is. She gives a humorless laugh and drinks down the drink in a single long gulp. It’s good, a fact that annoys her greatly. “You heard them. I was a troublemaker. Loud. Whatever. Not much to talk about.” She sets her glass down to the side and saunters up to Rio, letting her hips sway In a way she’s hopeful will take Rio’s mind off of her non-answer. “How about you, big boy?” She wraps her arms around Rio’s neck and Rio gulps, eyes dropping to Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“Big nerd,” Rio says too quickly, and Agatha determinately is not charmed by this. Agatha hums and leans in, hovering close enough for Rio to feel her breath on her mouth. “I was… fuck.” Rio closes the gap, pressing their lips together, and it’s as good as it was in the bar – better.</p><p>Agatha’s hands can’t stop moving, stroking the muscles of Rio’s arms, her back, snaking up the back of her neck and scratching at her scalp. Rio does the exact opposite – her hands find purchase on Agatha’s hips and she grips, hard. Agatha gasps into her mouth.</p><p>Rio takes that as an opportunity to drag her tongue across Agatha’s lip and Agatha has to squeeze her thighs together against the surge of arousal that courses suddenly through her. She wants that tongue all over, wants Rio to lick a path down from her neck along her sternum down past her navel, wants to grind against Rio’s nose and pull her hair and call her good boy when she makes her come.</p><p>”Fuck, Rio,” she whispers, and Rio’s hands move then, lowering to the backs of Agatha’s thighs and lifting her easily. Agatha moans, wrapping her legs around Rio’s waist and never breaking the kiss as Rio holds her. It’s unfair how hot that is. Rio carries her somewhere – back to the bed, Agatha hopes – and Agatha wraps her arms around Rio’s neck, one arm dangling over Rio’s shoulder and the other hand tangling further in Rio’s hair.</p><p>She gasps again when her back hits the wall and she uses the leverage to grind her pelvis into Rio’s abs, moaning at the barely-there friction she’s able to generate. Rio swears. “You have no idea what you’re doing to me.”</p><p>Agatha laughs. “I can think of a way to find out,” she promises, and she leans back, using her back against the door for leverage as she separates their bodies just enough to drag her fingers down Rio’s torso. Her legs are wrapped too high around Rio’s body for her hand to get where she really wants it, but the meaning is there, and she drives her point home when she leans forward again until her mouth is pressed against the shell of Rio’s ear and she whispers, “I bet you’re fucking dripping for me right now.”</p><p>Rio lets out a noise like a whimper and Agatha can’t resist a wolfish grin. Her fingers make quick work of the buttons of Rio’s shirt, revealing a simple heather gray sports bra that Agatha’s embarrassed to report makes her feel dizzy. Agatha shoves it off one shoulder, although Rio’s arms still holding her up make it disappointingly impossible to disrobe her further. It’s still enough to reveal one smooth bicep, which Rio flexes in a deeply unsubtle way that makes Agatha smirk and murmur “<em> Slut </em>” when she leans in to bite her again.</p><p>“Need you, Agatha, fuck,” Rio chokes out, as Agatha laves her tongue over the indents her teeth left. “Bed.”</p><p>“You’re holding me,” Agatha points out, pulling back to raise an eyebrow at Rio. “Seems like you’re in charge, pretty boy.”</p><p>It’s a laughable lie. Agatha watches Rio react and wonders if she could get the other woman to come in her pants before they even really start this.</p><p>Her thoughts are abandoned, though, as Rio moves to throw her on the bed – which, <em> fuck, </em> that’s hot – and manages to get her out of her shirt and fling her stupidly expensive lace bra somewhere across the room before Agatha can even respond. Then Rio’s mouth is on Agatha’s nipple, teasing it with her teeth while one hand plays with the soft skin just above the waistband of Agatha’s jeans, stoking the fire in Agatha’s lower stomach, and Agatha forgets to think at <em> all. </em></p><p>Instead, her head is filled with Rio’s mouth, Rio’s smell, the way Rio drops kisses down her stomach, the way Rio uses her teeth to pop open the button of Agatha’s jeans (as though that’s a real thing a real person can does, and not something ridiculous that only happens in porn. Agatha is going to pass out.), the way Rio waits for Agatha to arch her hips up off the bed to help her shimmy out of those jeans, and then Rio’s <em> tongue </em>, not even waiting to get her out of her underwear before pressing against the wet spot she finds there and groaning at the taste.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio says, and her voice is rough in a way that Agatha would appreciate far more if this conversation happened <em> after </em>she got her orgasm. She whines and pushes at Rio’s head to indicate what she really wants. “You taste so fucking good.”</p><p>“Then stop ta-” Agatha’s cut off by Rio hooking a finger in the gusset of her underwear and yanking it to the side to lick a long stripe up her, flicking over her clit at the end. She almost chokes on her own breath before managing to moan, threading her fingers through Rio’s hair to pull her closer.</p><p>Rio eats pussy like she’s got gills, and Agatha sends up a silent thank you to whatever cosmic sex god sent Rio her way. Rio doesn’t take her time, maybe sensing that Agatha’s more the demanding type than the patience type. She flickers her tongue over Agatha’s clit so quickly that it’s almost too much, just like how Agatha likes it, and Agatha clenches hard around nothing, feeling her own wetness trickling out of her with the movement.</p><p>“So fucking good,” Rio says, and Agatha can’t discern whether she’s talking about Agatha, or Agatha’s taste, or the way Agatha can’t stop rolling her hips up into her, but either way, she has to agree.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio, baby, <em> more </em> ,” she chokes out, incapable of more than a few syllables, and Rio changes angles just enough to bring her hand up and tease Agatha’s entrance with the tip of her finger, collecting her wetness and trailing her fingertip in a circle around her entrance. “Yes, <em> yes </em>,” Agatha gasps, and Rio presses in, first one, then quickly two, and Agatha lets out a stuttering moan.</p><p>She’s as good with her hands as Agatha hoped she’d be. Rio strokes deep and up, dragging her fingers over Agatha’s inner walls as her tongue doesn’t let up on Agatha’s clit, and Agatha arches and whines and squeezes tight around Rio’s fingers until Rio hits that one spot that makes Agatha feel like an electric shock is going through her body, starting from her cunt and starbursting outwards. “Fuck! Yes, right there, right there, don’t you fucking stop.” Her words are only just more coherent than complete babbling, but Rio listens, pistoning her fingers against that spot faster and faster before she adds a third, just enough to stretch Agatha perfectly, and Agatha comes with a scream, jerking against Rio’s mouth as Rio fucks her through it.</p><p>Rio surfaces and her face is glistening with Agatha’s slickness, from her eyebrows down to her chin, and Agatha wants to lick it off of her. “Can you go again?” she asks breathlessly, still three fingers deep, and Agatha thinks she’d be in love if that were a thing she were capable of.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>They only stop when Agatha’s hips can’t take it anymore, six – maybe seven? – orgasms in for Agatha, another three or four for Rio herself, including one that happened without Agatha’s intervention at all, which Agatha only caught because Rio’s tongue stopped moving and she let out a loud moan into Agatha’s bush. Agatha had proceeded to spend the next fifteen minutes teasing her for coming just from eating box until Rio growled at her that if Agatha didn’t stop making fun of her, Rio <em> was </em>going to come again, and wasn’t it much more fun when Agatha got to touch her through it?</p><p>In short, it’s some of the best sex of Agatha’s life, which is unfortunate only because she doesn’t really intend on seeing Rio ever again after the convention ends, and it’ll be a tough performance to top.</p><p>“Need a drink,” Agatha rasps out, collapsing into the pillows and gingerly stretching her legs. The bed is damp under her. Rio scrambles to her feet – how she still has energy to move like that, Agatha doesn’t know – and moves to grab them waters, and Agatha turns her head to look out the window. “Sun’s coming up.”</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio laughs, voice equally hoarse, and she moves back to the bed to hand Agatha a water. Agatha gulps it down gratefully.</p><p>They’re quiet for a minute, until Rio has to ruin it.</p><p>"What do you teach?" she asks, running a hand back through her sweat-slicked hair.</p><p>Agatha resists the urge to groan at the very concept of small talk after sex. They don't need to do this – the pillowtalk as though this is anything more than it is. She's fucked countless random teachers and professors at Ed Cons past, and she couldn't name one of them now. Nor does she want to.</p><p>But Rio fixes her with those big amber eyes and she feels an annoying compulsion to answer. Ugh. "Feminist Literature," she offers. She won't return the question. Even Bambi Eyes over here can't make her stoop to that level of polite pleasantries.</p><p>But the answer still makes Rio's face light up, and Agatha grips the sheet uncomfortably, tugging it over her chest to give herself something to focus on. "That's fascinating. Is there a specific era you focus on? Are we talking de Beauvoir, Lorde, Butler, Wittig?"</p><p>"It depends on which class," Agatha hand waves. She does not mention that she'll probably have to go back to the fucking basics whenever she finds her feet. Whatever fucking massive school has enough money to still be funding feminist anything will definitely have her dumbing shit down to a bunch of privileged white freshmen who are hearing for the first time that yes, the vast majority of famous suffragists were in fact raging racists.</p><p>Rio hums. “Do you have a favorite class you teach?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t want to talk about this. Doesn’t want to talk about work. “Anything where the kids actually give a shit.” She takes a drink. Deflects. “How about you? How’d you end up doing… whatever?”</p><p>“I’ve always been fascinated by death,” Rio says, like that’s a normal thing to open with, and when Agatha snorts, Rio gives her a smile that almost looks shy. Insane, really, to be shy after the ways she’s just manipulated Agatha’s body. “I, uh, I lost my family pretty young. Nothing dramatic, just… Well, anyways, I probably didn’t process it <em> normally </em>. I don’t know. I grieved, for sure. Of course. But I didn’t rage against it or get angry or any of the things people think you’re supposed to do. Death just felt so inevitable. Do you know what I mean? Like, it’s just the natural order of all things.” Rio sticks her tongue into her cheek and looks down at her fingers. “I probably sound so pretentious right now.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha says, irritated with herself for wanting to hear more. “I mean, I fundamentally disagree with you. But you don’t sound pretentious.”</p><p>Rio wrinkles her nose. “I mean, it <em> is, </em>though. There’s no escaping it. I don’t think death is cruel, I just think… it is. The universe moves on.”</p><p>Agatha bristles. “Death is absolutely cruel. Death is cruel and senseless and unfair.”</p><p>“Fairness doesn’t have anything to do with it, I don’t think. <em> People </em>are unfair. Death… It’s not fair or unfair, it just… is.” Rio shrugs. “I don’t mean to argue. But anyways, that got me really interested in grief responses and how people process trauma, which led me to studying psychology, and–” Rio cuts herself off, looking at Agatha with bright eyes, and Agatha’s blood runs cold.</p><p>No.</p><p>
<em> No. </em>
</p><p>"Oh my God, <em> that's </em> where I know you from!" Rio exclaims. Agatha is freezing. Rio needs to shut up. “Agatha <em> Harkness </em>. You used to do speeches on feminism and child psychology!”</p><p>Agatha can't breathe. She can't unclench her jaw. “No,” she grits out, forcing a breath out through her nose. “You must have me confused.”</p><p>“No, that was totally you! You talked about the online right wing pipeline that teen boys are thrust in and how the algorithms are programmed to radicalize kids. You have a son, too, right? Your research was based on–”</p><p>“Get out,” Agatha’s voice is unrecognizable to her own ears, just a shaky growl. Rio freezes. “Get the fuck out.”</p><p>“Agatha, what–”</p><p>“Get <em> out </em>!” Agatha hisses more insistently this time, and she doesn’t care that this is Rio’s hotel room, that they’re both still naked, that Rio is probably the most interesting person she’s talked to in a minute. Rio looks startled, confused. Agatha’s face feels hot, her arms feel cold.</p><p>“Agatha, I don’t know what’s going on, but I’m–”</p><p>“I don’t want to see you ever again,” Agatha says. “Get the fuck away from me.”</p><p>Rio hesitates but nods, stumbling backwards away from the bed to find clothes, throwing on a pair of sweatpants and a T-shirt that she grabs out of a duffel bag on the floor and shoving on her shoes as she gets to the door. “Agatha,” she tries again, softly, one hand on the door handle. “I’m s–”</p><p>“<em> Please </em> ,” Agatha heaves out, and Rio nods silently, her forehead still creased with concern, concern that makes Agatha feel <em> sick </em>, and Agatha squeezes her eyes shut until she hears the door open and close.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>So it’s like this.</p><p>Agatha has a son. Had – had a son.</p><p>Nicky.</p><p>Smiley and sweet and so, so beautiful, and Agatha was convinced she was going to fuck everything up, so she threw herself into learning everything she could about what the fuck to do with a kid and how to screw it up as minimally as possible. And with her academic background and the general state of the world, this led her to find an enormous amount of success researching the ways algorithmic bias pushes young white boys towards increasingly radical conservative media and how podcasts are stealing our sons souls, basically. Turns out articles about the manosphere are worth a lot, and then she was doing Ted Talks and getting guest lecture invites, and Nicky was perfect the whole time, and Agatha Harkness thought for a grand total of two minutes that maybe, <em> maybe </em>, she actually was capable of being happy.</p><p>And then Nicky died.</p><p>Some mystery illness that the doctors never came up with a name for, no matter how many times Agatha shook them down and threatened them for answers. It was symptomless until it wasn’t, until Agatha was cancelling classes to sit with Nicky while he threw up into a toilet, until Agatha was screaming on the phone to doctors while her son got smaller and smaller, until it was over.</p><p>Nicky died within four months of the first symptoms manifesting. It was the one thing Agatha couldn’t have prevented. She’d studied every way that she could have messed things up, done everything right, and Nicky had died anyways.</p><p>Agatha had cancelled everything. No more lectures, no more appearances. The university let her get away with not teaching for six months until they kindly encouraged her to either add a class to her schedule or move the fuck on. To their credit, they were understanding enough when she showed up with a syllabus featuring none of the things they’d hired her for, and instead just let her teach literature and retreat to safer ground. Until now.</p><p>Okay, maybe there was more to the <em> strategic funding cuts </em> bullshit than Agatha admitted earlier. Sue her for not explaining the incredibly blatant, barely-veiled undertone of <em> You’re not making us money anymore, so we’re not going to pay to keep you. </em></p><p>Agatha drags herself out of Rio’s bed sometime around 2, taking a long shower with Rio’s shit and stealing a sweatshirt and gym shorts out of the closet (<em> gym shorts </em>, like Rio’d been planning to go to the hotel gym while at a work convention. Who the fuck is this lady?). Part of her can’t believe that Rio actually unpacked – Agatha lives out of her suitcase for any trip shorter than a week – but it seems like exactly the kind of thing that real, functioning people do, so she doesn’t interrogate the thought too much.</p><p>Rio hasn’t come back, which is a fucking blessing, but Agatha’s never trusted her luck to last, so she gathers up her things and gets out of there.</p><p>Sharon should be at the convention, so she calls an Uber to their hotel, much farther from the convention center than Rio’s fucking luxury lodging, and makes it all the way up to their door before realizing her key card – and entire wallet – is somewhere on Rio’s floor and she’s entirely locked out.</p><p>She weighs her options – she could go to the front desk and ask for a replacement card, except that everything is under Sharon’s name, and she doesn’t have any of her ID anyways to prove that she belongs there. She could call someone for help. She settles on the least horrifying option, which is to sit on the floor in front of the door to their room, knees tucked up to her chest, and wallow in a very dignified way. <em> Death isn’t unfair. </em>Fuck off.</p><p>Her phone somehow still has 13% of its battery life left, even after a full night spent off-charger. Agatha can’t decide if this is a blessing or a curse. She’s got missed messages from multiple of her friends, including one from Jen that just says <em> What the fuck did you do </em> with no punctuation.</p><p>She ignores them all – the ire from Jen, the confusion from Alice, the concern from Lilia – and opens a web browser instead to spend the final dregs of her battery life googling “Rio Vidal”.</p><p>She’s a university-level grief counselor. Fucking <em> great </em>.</p><p>The universe is definitely playing a cosmic joke on Agatha. Or punishing her for not reading Rio’s stupid fucking pamphlet, which would’ve revealed that Rio works for a private therapy practice that primarily offers their services to universities, essentially leasing out counselors to universities for a school year. She’s here trying to sell herself to any university that’ll take her, same as Agatha.</p><p>Fuck, Agatha’s supposed to be networking right now.</p><p>She lets out a sound that’s definitely not a sob and gives herself another fifteen seconds of abject self-loathing and abstract anger towards Rio before pulling up her text thread with Jen and responding.</p><p align="right"><b>Jen</b><br/>

</b> <em> Don’t play dumb, Harkness. Why did Rio show up at my door crying at 4am? </em></p><p>Agatha winces.</p><p><b>Agatha</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> I imagine there are lots of reasons people would see you and cry, Hale </em></p><p align="right"><b>Jen</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> Jesus Christ. I asked for one thing: Leave Rio alone. And you couldn’t give me that? </em></p><p><b>Agatha</b><br/>
<em> Breaking! People don’t always get what they want! </em></p><p align="right"><b>Jen</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> You’re fucking insufferable. I’ll never understand how Alice can still be friendly with you. It’s so impossible to feel sorry for you when you’re so busy trying to make everyone else just as miserable as you are. </em></p><p><b>Agatha</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> well maybe I don’t need you to feel sorry for me </em></p><p align="right"><b>Jen</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> No, you’re right. Because you’re clearly doing great. </em></p><p><b>Agatha</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> fuck you </em></p><p align="right"><b>Jen</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> Fuck you. And you owe Rio an apology. </em></p><p>Agatha bites down too hard on the inside of her cheek and blood springs to the surface. This is stupid. She’s arguing with Jennifer fucking Kale, someone whose opinion of her she’d stopped caring about years ago.</p><p align="right"><b>Jen</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> Did you know Wanda’s having a baby? </em></p><p align="right"><b>Jen</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> She’s three months in </em></p><p align="right"><b>Jen</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> She’s been dying to tell you but everyone’s so fucking scared of how you’ll react because no one wants to hurt you </em></p><p align="right"><b>Jen</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> But you’re determined to be hurt either way so there it is. Congrats, you’re missing out on your friends’ lives. </em></p><p align="right"><b>Jen</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> I have to go listen to someone explain the world’s dumbest grading software. I’ll talk to you later. APOLOGIZE TO RIO. </em></p><p>Agatha stares at her phone until it blurs in front of her.</p><p>Wanda.</p><p>Pregnant.</p><p>Her immediate reaction is to throw up. Then she wants to yell, but realizes that the only thing worse than sitting on the ground in a hotel hallway is getting kicked out of said hotel.</p><p>So she gets up, marches her own self out of the hotel, and heads to the convention center.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Other professors give her weird looks, which Agatha scowls back at until she realizes it’s because they’re all in business casual or better and she’s currently dressed like she stole her clothes from some frat boy jock boyfriend that she doesn’t have.</p><p>But besides that, she’s able to weave her way through the center without incident, peering through the windows in each door until she finally finds who she’s looking for, sitting in the center of a panel on improving library research skills.</p><p>Agatha has to fight one of the organizers at the door to get in – apparently the room is at capacity, as though that has anything to do with her – and so her entrance is louder than she means for it to be, attracting attention. She waves an annoyed hand at the panelists, who pause before continuing.</p><p>The panel is actually decent, but as soon as it ends, Agatha’s focus flies to the woman in the fourth row, who stands and works her way through the crowd to stand in front of Agatha.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha says, and her cheeks feel hot suddenly. God, why is this embarrassing? “So, uh.”</p><p>“Are you okay?” Wanda asks, saving her from having to start the conversation. The redhead’s brow is furrowed in concern, and she purses her lips a little. “Everyone’s been worried about you.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha says, waving it off. “Whatever. This isn’t about me.”</p><p>Wanda looks even more alarmed at that, which – fair, actually.</p><p>“Sorry, I’m fucking this up.” Agatha laughs humorlessly, looking up and away from the other woman for a second to collect herself. “Uh, Jen told me you’re…”</p><p>She doesn’t finish her sentence, but she doesn’t have to. Wanda’s hand flies protectively to her stomach, and Agatha swallows hard and nods.</p><p>“Yeah. Um. So I wanted to say congrats, I guess. I’m sure you and that man will make… actually very good parents. Annoyingly good, really. I kinda hate you for it.”</p><p>Wanda laughs.</p><p>“And I’m sorry. That you didn’t feel like you could tell me.” Agatha bites the inside of her lip. “Ugh. This sucks.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda says softly, and she takes Agatha’s hand in hers with such softness that Agatha can actually feel a lump forming in her throat, which is downright <em> mortifying </em> . “I’m so happy you know now. I’ve been… <em> dying </em>to tell you.”</p><p>Agatha sniffs. “Yeah. Jen told me that, too.”</p><p>“I don’t know how to do this,” Wanda exhales. “And Vision is great, but he is <em> so much </em>. He keeps telling me what sizes everything should be – like, I don’t actually want to know how many millimeters my baby’s organs are supposed to be this week? And I don’t know anyone else who’s done this before, and you–” Wanda cuts herself off, something that Agatha feels grateful for and then immediately guilty for feeling grateful for. “I don’t want to put anything on you that you’re not ready for. But I’m really glad you’re here. And I want you to be here for this.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a shaky breath. “I can be here.”</p><p>Wanda smiles. “I just found out I’m having twins. I haven’t told anyone yet – I only found out right before the convention. One of them was hiding right behind the other.”</p><p>Agatha’s gut reaction is to be pissed off at the universe – of course, perfect Wanda gets two babies, while Agatha couldn’t even keep one. But she tamps it down and smiles and even laughs when Wanda tells her she was worried about how she was going to hide the bump if they didn’t tell Agatha soon.</p><p>And that’s progress.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Agatha spends the rest of Ed Con in Wanda’s hotel, which she’s relieved to discover is exactly as shitty as hers. She sends Sharon a text telling her she’ll get her stuff before they check out, then turns off her phone while Wanda fills her in on everything she’s missed.</p><p>It’s obnoxious, honestly, how bubbly Wanda is and how incapable she is of telling a story succinctly. Agatha really does not care this much about Wanda’s life.</p><p>But that’s how they’ve always been, really, and something about it feels familiar, feels comfortable in a way Agatha hasn’t felt since before Nicky died. Wanda yammering on about shit Agatha doesn’t not give a single shit about is <em> their </em> dynamic. Agatha laughs at the right parts and threatens to kill Wanda’s dog when Wanda tells a story about Sparky getting too excited when they tested confetti cannons for a future gender reveal – and God, Agatha can’t believe she’s friends with someone who wants to have a <em> gender reveal </em>– and it feels good.</p><p>And blessedly, Wanda doesn’t even bring up Rio until the last day.</p><p>“So,” Wanda says, unsubtly, and Agatha looks at her. “Do you have anything else you need to do before you leave?”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “I haven’t packed yet.”</p><p>“Riiiiiight,” Wanda responds, dragging out the word. “Anything… else?”</p><p>“Nope.” Agatha looks ahead at the TV across from Wanda’s bed, which is playing an old episode of The Price Is Right.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“What? I’m good.”</p><p>“Those aren’t your clothes.”</p><p>Agatha looks down at the sweatshirt and shorts she hasn’t taken off in days. <em> Ugh </em>. “They are now.”</p><p>“You need to talk to Rio. I’m serious. She was really upset.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “<em> Really upset </em>. Please. We’re adults. We hooked up once. It’s not like we were going to fall in love.”</p><p>Wanda has the audacity to look disappointed, which is unfair when Agatha has been trying <em> so fucking hard </em>. “Rio’s not like that, Agatha. I don’t know what you said to her, but it really hurt her. You should go and at least give her an explanation. And some closure. And definitely her hoodie back.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t want to give Rio’s hoodie back. It’s soft and stupid and still smells like that fucking tea tree shampoo, even though it’s not about that, it’s literally just because it’s comfortable.</p><p>But Agatha finds herself at the world’s fanciest hotel anyways, bitterly thinking that if she’d only been 10% less horny the first night, she could’ve avoided this whole mess and maybe actually found a job like she was supposed to.</p><p>She takes a deep breath and strides in like she owns the place. The hotel is still obnoxiously nice in the light of day. Agatha had hoped that the gold gilding would look a little more like a lackluster yellow in daylight, but it gleams as brightly as it had over Rio’s shoulder the first night.</p><p>She gets all the way to the elevator before realizing she has no fucking memory of what room Rio’s actually staying in. The last time she was here, she’d been a bit preoccupied. She considers trying the front desk before realizing that she’ll absolutely look like a stalker, and instead decides to guess, stabbing at the ‘up’ button on the elevator and trying to remember how high it had looked out Rio’s window that night.</p><p>She makes a guess at the tenth floor, which looks… exactly the same as probably every other floor here. Agatha’s going to fucking resort to knocking on doors like a Girl Scout, Jesus.</p><p>Or… fuck, she’s got a worse idea. She opens her phone and decides on Alice as her safest contact.</p><p><b>Agatha</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> Do you know Rio’s room number? </em></p><p align="right"><b>Alice</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> what? </em></p><p>Agatha makes a noise of frustration at having to explain herself. God, communication and vulnerability are always so horrifyingly embarrassing.</p><p><b>Agatha</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> Rio Vidal. About 5’6”. Brown hair. Pretty eyes. Last seen with an embarrassingly large collection of hickeys. Sound familiar? </em></p><p align="right"><b>Alice</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> agatha, i don’t think she wants to see you right now </em></p><p><b>Agatha</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> I didn’t ask if she wants to see me. I asked what her room number is. </em></p><p align="right"><b>Alice</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> right… i just feel like it’s not really my place to share that? have you tried texting her? </em></p><p><b>Agatha</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> When would I have gotten her phone number? </em></p><p>She’s saved from this pointless conversation by the sound of a door opening, thankfully. Maybe someone here can at least say if they’ve <em> seen </em>Rio before, or if she’s completely on the wrong floor.</p><p>But she looks up and her questions disappear.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio startles when Agatha says her name, jumping and looking up from where she’s standing at her door. She still looks beautiful, hair tousled like she’s just run her fingers through it. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>Agatha leans against the wall, trying to look effortlessly confident, hopefully landing at least above ‘sagging into the wall with exhaustion.’ “I left my wallet here,” she says, and Rio’s face hardens, her tongue taking its place in her cheeks before she sighs.</p><p>She unlocks her door and leans inside, grabbing something just beyond the door before stepping back out and tossing Agatha’s wallet her way. “I was going to leave it with Alice and Jen. I figured you’d see them at some point.”</p><p>“Right. Maybe.” Agatha does not add that prior to Ed Con, it’s been months since she talked to either of them. She’s taken enough accountability for being a bad friend this weekend. “Listen, sorry if things got weird. You were… Don’t take it personally, okay? I’m just kind of an asshole.”</p><p>“I recognized you and you kicked me out of my own hotel room.” Rio turns away from her door, crossing her arms defensively across her chest. Agatha mirrors the pose until she realizes what she’s doing and forces her arms to drop.</p><p>“I mean, you’re the one who said you like to study responses to grief,” Agatha tries to joke. It comes out strangled, and worse, Rio just frowns with a confused look. “Fuck. Jen didn’t tell you?”</p><p>“Tell me what, Agatha?” Rio presses her lips together.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth goes dry. Years, and she still hasn’t figured out how to say this without losing it. “You… My son… He, uh…”</p><p>Rio’s face drops. “Fuck. That’s awful.”</p><p>Agatha forces herself to shrug. “Right.”</p><p>“Can I ask what happened?”</p><p>“You can,” Agatha says, mostly as a stalling technique. When Rio waits for an answer, she runs her tongue over her teeth and focuses on a random sconce to avoid eye contact. “I don’t really know. He got sick. I went to <em> every </em>doctor.” Her voice breaks. “I tried everything I could think of. I’m banned from three different hospitals, actually.”</p><p>“Can they do that?” Rio’s genuine bafflement makes Agatha bark out a laugh.</p><p>“Fuck, I guess. That seems crazy though, right? Like, what happens if I get in a car accident in Philly? They just let me die I guess?”</p><p>“There are federal laws that prevent that,” Rio says, and Agatha wants to call her a nerd but she doesn’t want to fuck things up.</p><p>“Well. Tell that to CHOP.”</p><p>“Fucked up name for a hospital. Fortunately I don’t think they’d send you to a children’s hospital if you did get in a car accident. Even if you’re very short.”</p><p>“I’m <em> barely </em>shorter than you.” Agatha glares at Rio before she remembers she’s supposed to be treading carefully and, like, apologizing. “Anyways. Sorry if I freaked out on you. I just don’t really… talk about all that. Anymore.”</p><p>“Ever?”</p><p>“If you try to sell me therapy right now, I’ll kill you. And I don’t think my friends can handle me processing another loss.”</p><p>“So I’d be a loss to you,” Rio says lightly, then looks immediately like she regrets saying it. “Sorry. Inappropriate.”</p><p>“I have your sweatshirt,” Agatha says, mostly to stop herself from saying anything else, like <em> I haven’t stopped thinking about flirting with you at the bar </em> or <em> This whole thing brought me closer to my friends than anything has since Nicky died so I’m scared you might be good for me </em> or worst of all, <em> I might need you to forgive me </em>.</p><p>“You can keep it,” Rio says. “I have, like, dozens.”</p><p>“No, seriously,” Agatha says. “I don’t actually want to steal from you.”</p><p>“Well. You forgot your socks, not just your wallet. So call it an even trade.” Rio moves to walk past her, and Agatha is stricken with a sense of desperation.</p><p>“Wait. Uh, Rio.”</p><p>Rio stops. “Yes?”</p><p>“I am. Uh. Sorry.” She fidgets. “Fuck, I hate apologizing. But I do like you. Ugh, I mean I liked hanging out with you.”</p><p>“It was good sex,” Rio finishes for her, but Agatha shakes her head.</p><p>“No. I mean, <em> yes </em> . Obviously. You’re very good at that, and I still don’t know– no, that’s not the point. I liked talking to you. At the bar. And now. And in bed, too, before it went south.” She huffs out a sigh. “I think you’re interesting. Which is annoying. I mean, you heard the others, I hooked up with them and didn’t think any of <em> them </em>were interesting enough to stick around for.” Agatha grimaces, but Rio looks vaguely amused, which is the only sign that she’s not totally blowing this. “I’m not trying to… I just… I don’t want to never see you again, I guess.”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, are you asking me out?” Rio teases, and Agatha doesn’t know what that makes her feel nervous. She’s so off her game.</p><p>“No. I just… it’d be a loss if you died. Cruel and senseless and unfair.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widen just briefly. “Wouldn’t be fair or unfair,” she breathes out. “It just would be.”</p><p>“Agree to disagree?”</p><p>Rio gives her a small smile. “Agatha, I think you are fascinating. And funny, and brilliant. And so hot, and I think I’m obsessed with you, unfortunately, because I haven’t been able to take my mind off of you, which has been <em> so </em>inconvenient. Like, I had goals for this weekend. Do you know how many people I’ve managed to give my business card to? I’m gonna ballpark it at three, tops.”</p><p>Agatha fights a smile.</p><p>“I think you need to talk to your friends first. And once you get that figured out… if you haven’t forgotten about me… ask Alice and Jen for my number. I’ll take you to coffee.” Rio steps forward, closer to Agatha. “I’ve got to go, my boss is expecting a call any minute.” She presses a kiss to Agatha’s cheek and Agatha holds her breath through it. “Enjoy your Ed Con, Agatha. It was really something to meet you.”</p><p>And then she’s gone.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>It takes Agatha two months to get a job, which really is not bad, all things considered.</p><p>She’s teaching mostly intro-level gender and sexuality classes, with a bunch of kids who don’t give a shit, but she actually tries.</p><p>She watches one of her old lectures on YouTube for the first time in years and actually works on rewriting it to reflect updated technology and content moderation online – and when she sends it to her old editor for an extra set of eyes, she gets an enthusiastic response that praises her for writing again.</p><p>She gets invited to Wanda’s gender reveal. Two boys, and Wanda cries, and Agatha even hugs Vision. Rio is there, her hair shorter than it was at the convention, looking much more casual and devastatingly attractive in a yellow muscle tank half-tucked into jeans. Agatha, wearing a purple shirt because fuck gender, stares at her from across the yard until Rio brings her a drink and tells her that if she stares any harder, someone’s going to start a rumor.</p><p>She starts texting Jen again. Jen is slow to respond at first, but she warms up over time. Agatha is <em> not </em>a bitch when Jen starts sending her pictures of the house she and Alice want to buy, and she even takes them out for housewarming drinks when the sale goes through. She hopes, quietly, that they’ll tell Rio about it and she’ll come, but either they don’t or she doesn’t, because either way, it’s just them, Lilia, and an increasingly pregnant Wanda.</p><p>Rio does come to Wanda’s baby shower. Agatha buys Wanda an all-inclusive trip to a spa for a year from now and a baby-wearer for Vision. This makes Rio laugh, which makes Agatha smile. Baby steps.</p><p>The twins are born. Agatha and Rio both go to Wanda’s family Christmas party during the break. Rio wears a green sweater and Agatha gets drunk on champagne and spends the night thinking about taking it off of her but doesn’t make a move. Rio leans too close to Agatha on the couch when Wanda makes them all take a group picture, and Agatha breathes in tea tree.</p><p>Another semester comes and goes. Professor Harkness gets 5/5 across categories on ratemyprofessors (along with a flaming hot chili pepper, which does slightly contradict the reports of her effectiveness as an educator of gender studies), and her popularity is reflected in her student reviews, too. She signs another contract with the university. Sends her editor a more fleshed out draft of her book. Her editor tells her to get her agent to pitch it, and she has to dig up another old contact, but she reaches out.</p><p>She starts going to therapy, too, because fuck it. Maybe Rio was right. She talks about Nicky and cries and it doesn’t feel nearly as heavy as it used to.</p><p>In late August, she decides to have everyone over for drinks and a barbecue for the last Friday before the new school year starts. It takes three days of indecision before she sends Jen a text.</p><p><b>Agatha</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> Can I ask you a question without you asking any follow up questions? </em></p><p align="right"><b>Jen</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> Almost definitely not. Why? </em></p><p><b>Agatha</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> Wow. All this work I’ve put into self-improvement, and I can’t even get a little bit of trust from my oldest friend. </em></p><p align="right"><b>Jen</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> I’m not your oldest friend </em></p><p align="right"><b>Jen</b> <b><br/>

</b> <em> Hi </em></p><p>She does not hide from her phone or a potential response. She <em> does </em>put her phone down in a very calm and normal way and spend the next four hours cleaning her house. This is normal, she rationalizes. People are coming over in a matter of days. Cleaning up is just responsible.</p><p>But Rio hasn’t responded when she’s done, nor does she respond the next morning. Agatha tries again.</p><p><b>Agatha</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> Hello? </em></p><p>It’s another day before she tries again.</p><p><b>Agatha</b> <b><br/>

</b> <em> :) </em></p><p>Texting Rio opens a can of worms that Agatha hadn’t prepared for.</p><p>Rio has a horrible sleep schedule, so Agatha wakes up to dozens of texts with random thoughts from Rio, little stories that occur to her to share, random shit she finds online. Rio will send her pictures of dogs she sees on her morning runs, something that would irritate Agatha if it were anyone else, but which is almost endearing from Rio. In exchange, Agatha sends her updates on how lesson planning is going, complains about the repair guy she had to call in to patch her roof who keeps walking in on her in her robe, and makes fun of therapy as a field when her latest appointment digs too deeply into her shit childhood. </p><p>Rio’s absence does also leave Agatha planning a barbecue that she really does not care about anymore, but she gets her friends nice and drunk, makes Alice barbecue, and talks shit about her class schedule with them.</p><p>“I can’t even reuse any of last year’s lesson plans,” she grouses.</p><p>“Isn’t this what you wanted?” Alice asks. “You don’t like doing the entry level classes.”</p><p>“I know what she wants,” Jen teases, and Alice gives her a look.</p><p>“Babe, be nice,” she warns, but Jen just gives a mischievous grin into her drink.</p><p>“I’m so left out,” Wanda complains. “What did I miss?”</p><p>“Oh, nothing,” Jen says. “Agatha and Rio have been <em> texting </em>.”</p><p>“Shut up, Jen,” Agatha retorts. “You don’t know anything. I asked for Rio’s number to invite her to this barbecue. That’s it.”</p><p>“That’s it?” Jen challenges. “That’s not what I heard.”</p><p>“What did you hear?” Wanda asks, eyes wide.</p><p>“She didn’t hear anything,” Agatha stresses. “Because I haven’t said anything. Because there’s nothing to say.”</p><p>“There’s something to say,” Jen says, leaning back in her chair. “You’re not the only one who tells me things.”</p><p>Agatha’s face burns. “Rio’s talking to you about me?”</p><p>“Obviously,” Alice says, giving Agatha a look. “She hasn’t stopped talking about you for m-” Jen nudges her and cuts her off. “Right. Anyways!”</p><p>“No, what were you going to say?” Agatha demands. “What is she saying about me?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Jen says. “Just that we’re all <em> so </em>excited for you to get drinks when she’s back from Oxford.”</p><p>“I’m going to make her sign an NDA,” Agatha swears. “Or – she’s a therapist, right? This is a violation of HIPAA.”</p><p>“Agatha, as a professor of medicine, I am <em> begging </em> you to learn what HIPAA means. I’m so sick of everyone – wait, fuck you. I’m not getting off topic. You and Rio are going to bang in, like, six days, and I’m actually <em> happy </em>about it, which is crazy.”</p><p>“Six days?” Agatha asks. “Is that when she’s getting back?”</p><p>“I’m surprised you’re not tracking her flight on your phone,” Jen says, and Agatha rolls her eyes.</p><p>“This is the least efficient way I’ve ever seen you call Agatha a dyke,” Alice comments.</p><p>“You people are annoying, and I’m going to kick you out of my home,” Agatha declares. “I regret ever rekindling our friendship. I’m only keeping Lilia around because I’m still hoping she’ll let me hit.”</p><p>“Oh, honey, I think your new girlfriend might take issue with that,” Lilia says, and Agatha is actually never going to tell them anything ever again.</p><p>She <em> does </em>tell Rio, though, once everyone’s gone home. It’s a few minutes before 5am for her, but Agatha shoots off a quick text and Rio responds right away.</p><p><b>Agatha</b> <b><br/>

</b> <em> Friday works </em></p><p align="right"><b>Rio</b> <b><br/>
</b> <em> great! it’s a date </em></p><p>The text doesn’t leave Agatha’s mind all week.</p><p>She hasn’t been this nervous to hook up with someone since she was seventeen and doing it for the first time in a car parked in the driveway of her then-girlfriend’s parents’ house. Are they even hooking up? Is she reading into it? They hadn’t specified that it was <em> romantic. </em>For all Agatha knew, Rio was going to show up and give her some sort of therapy pop quiz to test if she’d really been working on her mental health in the year since the Ed Con fiasco.</p><p>She throws herself into her classes instead, spending the weekend reviewing and re-editing her syllabi and lesson plans, drafting assignments, and even turning her attention back to her side project – the not-quite-manuscript she’s been drafting in her free time.</p><p>Monday brings the start of classes.</p><p>Fewer early level classes this year means more students who actually attend office hours, especially the first week. Some of them stand out, asking interesting questions about the course material. Most of them are just showing up to office hours to lay down the groundwork early in case they need to ask for a grade bump later in the semester.</p><p>It’s an exhausting week, even if her classes are mostly just about going over the syllabi. Her responses to Rio’s texts are shorter than she wants them to be, and she hopes Rio thinks it’s a symptom of their time difference and not a lack of interest. Worst of all, a department meeting gets thrown on her calendar for late Friday, and she has to shoot Rio a text asking if they can push their date to the weekend, since she definitely won’t be up to going out after that.</p><p>She spends Thursday night trying on half her wardrobe to pick out an outfit to wear, taking two hours to go through her closet before deciding on a dark green blazer that she hangs in her bathroom so it’ll steam when she takes a shower. When she can’t sleep, she moves to her computer to work on her book, hoping it’ll take her mind off Rio and tire her out.</p><p>It’s late by the time she looks up at the clock, and she’s about to close her laptop and go to sleep when there’s a knock at the door.</p><p>Who the hell is there at this hour? It’s almost midnight. Agatha pushes her hair off her face and makes her way down to answer the front door.</p><p>Rio’s standing there, a carry-on bag slung over one shoulder, wearing a long-sleeved baseball tee and a pair of cargo joggers that hang too-low on her hips. She gives a half-smile when Agatha answers the door. Even with exhaustion lining the planes of her face, she’s gorgeous. “Sorry,” she says breathlessly, “I hope I’m not intruding. I just didn’t want to wait another day to see you.”</p><p>Agatha drags her eyes up and down Rio’s body, trying to process that she’s actually here. “What?”</p><p>“I came right from the airport. I’m jet-lagged as fuck, so please feel free to send me home if I’m bad company. I was just hoping I could get that drink… now?”</p><p>Agatha wants to kiss her. Agatha wants to yell at her for not giving any warning before showing up at her door. Agatha… lets her into the house.</p><p>“How was your flight?” she asks on autopilot, because that’s what you do when your former-hook-up maybe-friend definitely-crush has just gotten off of a plane.</p><p>“Long,” Rio says, dropping her bag next to the door. “Your house is nice.”</p><p>“Thanks. That’s Ted Talk money,” Agatha says. “You’re really here?”</p><p>“I’m really here,” Rio confirms. “I thought Ted Talks don’t pay?”</p><p>“People start offering you way more money to speak at their university once you’ve given one. You didn’t want to wait?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio laughs. “Forgive me for not wanting to waste another second not looking at you.”</p><p>Agatha laughs then, really laughs. “They teach you how to sweet talk in England?”</p><p>“Can’t help myself around you,” Rio says. “You know that.” She lets out a big yawn. “Sorry.”</p><p>“Oh, sweetheart. You really are jet lagged.”</p><p>“‘m not <em> too </em>jet lagged,” Rio protests, but she’s foiled by another yawn. “Fuck, maybe I am. I just want to talk.”</p><p>“We can talk,” Agatha says, “but if you fall asleep on my couch, I’m not carrying you to bed.”</p><p>“Good. I’d want to be awake for that.”</p><p>Agatha gets her a glass of water and settles next to her on the couch. “I thought this would be awkward,” she admits. “Seeing you like this and talking again.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio agrees. “I… I mean I think it helps that it’s not like it’s been a year of no contact. I’ve seen you at Wanda’s stuff. And you’re clearly doing amazing.”</p><p>“<em> Moi </em>?” Agatha asks, faux-humble, and Rio gives her a dumb grin.</p><p>“I feel like I’ve been waiting for this since the moment we left that stupid hotel.”</p><p>“That hotel wasn’t stupid,” Agatha says. “That hotel was maybe the nicest place I’ve ever been.”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. “You should’ve seen where they put me up in Oxford.”</p><p>“Should I quit my job and sell out?”</p><p>“Working for a mental health company is hardly selling out. And no – don’t forget I know what those students are like. It’s a mess out there. The youth need you.” Rio seems to tense up after her words.</p><p>Agatha does too, for a minute. Then she breathes out. “I’m making the students handwrite everything this year. If I have to see one more essay with a ChatGPT prompt left in, I’ll make the national news.”</p><p>“No one has ever suffered the way you have,” Rio teases gently, and Agatha makes an overdramatic woe-is-me gesture that should be embarrassing but makes Rio laugh.</p><p>“Tell me about your trip,” Agatha asks, and Rio launches into a rambling story about how one of the members of Oxford’s executive leadership team doesn’t believe in mental health and kept suggesting they just give students a discount code for Better Help instead of hiring real counselors.</p><p>“At least I’m not the only one at risk of being replaced by computers,” Agatha jokes, and Rio groans.</p><p>“Ugh, at least we’ll be old and unemployed <em> together </em>.”</p><p>“Future planning, huh, Vidal?”</p><p>Rio flushes prettily. “I can’t be held accountable for anything I say right now. I’m half asleep. My defenses are down.” Agatha quirks an eyebrow and Rio groans. “Stop that. You got me. I’ll tell you everything.” Rio runs her tongue across the inside of her cheek.</p><p>Agatha snorts. “You need to sleep.” She shifts. “Do you want to crash here tonight?”</p><p>“I can’t,” Rio says. “I should get home.” She pauses. “I have a hot date this weekend so I <em> really </em>need my beauty rest.”</p><p>“A hot date? Don’t make me jealous.”</p><p>Rio hums. “I think I’d like to see that actually.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice is throaty when she answers, “Believe me, you wouldn’t.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes darken. “You can’t talk like that when I’m trying to be respectful and not drag you to the bedroom immediately.” The energy is undercut by another yawn. Agatha snorts.</p><p>“I’ll see you on Saturday.”</p><p>“Can’t wait,” Rio mumbles around another yawn. She lets Agatha walk her to the door before looking at Agatha with sleepy eyes. “Can I…”</p><p>“I’m going to kiss you now,” Agatha finishes for her, and Rio gives an eager nod that Agatha would make fun of if Rio weren’t half asleep. Agatha steps forward but it’s Rio who closes the gap anyways, pressing their lips together.</p><p>Rio tastes like airplane breath. Agatha has the fleeting thought that she’d be happy to breathe in airplane breath everyday if it means she gets to keep kissing Rio like this.</p><p>Agatha brushes her tongue over Rio’s lower lip and Rio hums against her lips and pulls back. “If I don’t leave now, I’m not going to be able to,” she murmurs.</p><p>“Is it selfish if I say I don’t want you to?”</p><p>Rio goes back in for another kiss. “Saturday,” she promises.</p><p>“Saturday,” Agatha exhales.</p><p>Rio texts as soon as she’s home, a selfie of herself in bed squinting against the flash and giving the camera a peace sign. Agatha snorts.</p><p><b>Agatha</b> <b><br/>

But the ravenous look Rio gives her when she sees her is worth it. Agatha adjusts her glasses. Whatever. She wanted to look good.</p><p>“Professor Harkness,” Rio greets, her voice lilting as she teases Agatha. “It’s an honor to take you out for drinks.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha says.</p><p>“Make me,” Rio responds. “You look like I should be asking you what I can do to raise my grade.”</p><p>“Don’t be gross.” Agatha considers for a minute. “Or, do. See where it takes you.”</p><p>Rio groans. “You can’t say things like that and not expect me to want to take you to any bedroom immediately.”</p><p>“And if I say that’s exactly what I’m hoping for?”</p><p>Rio leans in close enough that Agatha can smell tea tree shampoo. Rio smells exactly like she had that day a year ago. It feels like coming home. “I’d say you owe me a drink first.”</p>
