<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Rio gets the call on a Tuesday at 9 at night. She’s lying in bed upside down, half her back on a heating pad, limbs sprawled. She’s sore (she’s always sore) and grumpy and bored. Rio is the kind of person who almost aggressively ignores her phone. Truthfully she has very little time for it between day-long rehearsals and performances, but it’s also born of a little bit of spite for technology and a deep seated need to make people chase her, just a little.</p><p>Which is why she’d normally just knock the buzzing phone on the floor and ignore it until her alarm went off in the morning. If it weren’t Lilia calling.</p><p>She owes Lilia. Everyone owes Lilia.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>But that doesn’t mean she has to be nice about it.</p><p>“Good evening to you too, darling.” Her godmother’s voice is pleasantly casual. “I have a favor to ask.”</p><p>“I don’t have time for favors, Lilia, as you well know.”</p><p>“You’ll do this one.”</p><p>And Rio knows she can’t argue.</p><p>–</p><p>Which is how Rio finds herself on a movie set, somehow excused from afternoon rehearsal (Lilia, more favors, honestly she’s a little scared of her godmother’s power). She’s clutching a lukewarm coffee in one hand. She’s dressed in rehearsal clothes, one leg warmer pooling at her ankle and the other pulled up to her thigh. Her warm up jacket is slipping off one shoulder to reveal the edgiest, blackest leotard the company lets her get away with. It’s not like she has many other clothes - and technically, she is here in her role as a dancer. Or dance instructor. Sort of.</p><p>When she turns in search of direction, there’s a nervous-looking young man hovering at her elbow. Rio arches a brow. Her stare is utterly deadpan. She loves nervous people, they’re hilarious.</p><p>“Uh - hi.” He says, clutching a clipboard to his chest. “Rio Vidal?”</p><p>She sighs, letting a pause settle between them before nodding.</p><p>“Oh, ok, great.” Relief spreads over his expression. As if there would be a different dancer just wandering onto an extremely closed movie set on a random afternoon. “Um, so, I’m Billy - I’m a PA.”</p><p>“Okay.” She replies, slowly. Rio has never minded awkward silences, and she doesn’t speak unless she wants to. Billy clearly feels differently.</p><p>“I’m Agatha - Miss Harkness’s - personal PA,” He explains. “And I am here - uh, to gather you?”</p><p>“Gather me?” Rio’s eyebrow raises a little more, a smirk playing on her lips. “Did Agatha request some kind of special harvest?”</p><p>“Uh, no, I mean - she’s - ready for you.”</p><p>“...I’ll bet.” Rio grins. She may have done a bit of googling on Agatha after Lilia had secured her services as a dance coach for the successful actress. Rio doesn’t have a lot of time for movies, but even she’d heard the name Agatha Harkness before. She’d heard people gush about her awards, her life-changing performances, her selfless adoption of a young orphan. The press constantly talks about her intimidating presence, the power that made her a titan of the industry at 45 years old. What she hadn’t known was that Agatha was apparently famously gay as hell.</p><p>Which meant Rio’s friends had really dropped the ball, considering Agatha was just Rio’s type.</p><p>And she was really hoping she might be Agatha’s.</p><p>Despite Agatha’s out-and-proud presence online and in interviews, there wasn’t much to be found about the older woman’s romantic history. Her “Personal Life” wikipedia section remained frustratingly blank on that subject, and Rio couldn’t find any indication on her current relationship status. Well, some celebrities were notoriously private.</p><p>Even on their personal instagrams, apparently.</p><p>Personal instagrams Rio probably shouldn’t have access to, but then, Lilia probably shouldn’t have asked her goddaughter for help setting up all her accounts.</p><p>As it was, Rio was helpfully logged in to Lilia’s account and had a full view of the private instagram page Agatha had filled with nothing but pictures of her son and their pet bunny. Not even one slightly salacious mirror selfie. It was disappointing, honestly. Rio had seen spicier content in the magazines Agatha graced the covers of, but none of those told her what she really wanted to know.</p><p>What probably thousands of people wanted to know, actually. Was Agatha Harkness single, and did she like younger women?</p><p>Rio adjusted her jacket, pulling it down her shoulders further, making sure every black mesh cut out on her leotard could be seen. She was ready to…investigate.</p><p>“So, um, this way please?” Billy gestured to Rio, glancing back at her as he started to walk off. She’d been drifting a little, perhaps. But she’s looking forward to today, so she makes no complaint as she saunters after the little production assistant. (well, ok, he’s taller than her - but he’s clearly just a kid)</p><p>They take a circuitous path backstage, and everything looks exactly the same - Rio will not be able to find her way back here again, so she’s kind of hoping Billy is her personal PA for the duration of this experience too.</p><p>Billy leads her to a nondescript room, with nothing a small placard on the door that says “rehearsal 1B” to indicate its use. It looks like it has windows, but there are heavy curtains over them. Anticipation runs through Rio. The familiarity of a rehearsal space is nothing to her, but she’s very ready to meet the woman behind that door.</p><p>Only when Billy pulls out a key and lets her in, she finds it completely empty. There’s a single barre at the back, standard floor-to-ceiling mirrors at one end, and a little rolling cart in the corner set up with a bluetooth speaker. And nothing else. Certainly no famous milf in all her glory.</p><p>Rio levels a glare at Billy - a probably undeserved glare, but she was pretty sure she’d been promised Agatha.</p><p>Billy just looks a little perplexed. “Um. She’s - probably running late.” He says, a shrug of his shoulder like he’s not in charge of Agatha’s schedule. He starts fiddling with his little headset.</p><p>“Seems to me like you ought to know where she is.” Rio says, casually striding into the room and dumping her bag on the floor like she already owns the space. “I’m not an expert but I think that might be your job?”</p><p>“Well, Agatha told me to bring you here, and -”</p><p>“So you’re her puppy? Playing fetch?”</p><p>“I’m her assistant. Kind of.” Billy lets the insult wash over him as if he’s used to it, and starts speaking quietly into his headset. Rio turns away from him, bored. She’s about to reach for her phone and ask Lilia to get to the bottom of this when the door opens again.</p><p>Agatha enters without looking at either of them. She’s wearing a long purple silk robe - Rio has no idea what’s underneath, but she’d just love to find out - and her hair is up in a messy bun. She’s got her long fingers loosely wrapped around an iced latte, the touch lazy and dominant at once. She strides right past Billy, right past Rio - so close she can feel a breeze lift at the wisps of hair near her cheeks - and deposits her coffee next to the bluetooth speaker.</p><p>“You can go now, Teen.” Agatha says without turning around, pulling a phone out from who knows where and beginning to fiddle with something on it, absolutely unconcerned with Rio’s presence. She bites down on her lower lip as she types, red lipstick remaining undisturbed and crisp.</p><p>Rio’s maybe a little bit in love.</p><p>It’s probably not healthy that she likes being ignored. But god, Agatha’s sexy. The power and confidence she radiates gets right under Rio’s skin.</p><p>“Uh, right.” Billy throws an almost apologetic look at Rio and darts out of the room, door clicking firmly shut behind him. Rio’s not sorry at all. She’s right where she wants to be.</p><p>Agatha finally puts down her phone after a hearty silence, but instead of turning to face Rio, she picks up her coffee cup again. Rio grins. She’s not sure what game Agatha is playing, exactly, but she’s excited for it.</p><p>Cheerfully, she kicks her bag aside and drops her jacket on top of it. In lieu of further instruction, she begins going through a warm-up routine. She’s here to dance, isn’t she?</p><p>Rio lets herself get lost in her stretches, a mindless task that her body knows well. She only pauses when she can feel Agatha’s eyes on her, like a sunbeam warming her skin. With a grin, she looks up from her straddle stretch and meets blue eyes.</p><p>“Hi, milady.” She says, teasingly. Agatha answers with a raise of her brow, slowly setting her cup down and taking a step towards Rio. A chill runs down Rio’s spine.</p><p>“It’s Agatha.” Her tone leaves no room for argument, but there’s a light in her eyes that Rio wants to believe is from amusement. Rio moves a little deeper into the stretch. She knows Agatha is watching. She likes it.</p><p>“Whatever you say.” Rio responds in a low, low voice. “You can call me Rio, if it pleases you.”</p><p>“And if it doesn’t?” Agatha issues the challenge. Rio really hopes it’s flirting, but she doesn’t know Agatha’s style yet. She’ll have to push it a little more.</p><p>“You’re in control, Agatha. You tell me.” Rio finally pulls herself out of the stretch, looking up at Agatha. She likes her view.</p><p>“Lilia told me all about you.” Agatha says, her eyes clearly studying Rio, making a private assessment of the younger woman. “I’m not sure if she told the whole truth. But regardless, here’s how this will go. You’re here to coach me on how to look like a former dancer. I expect results quickly. We don’t have time to waste, and I don’t need to be an expert. And I don’t need a young upstart showing off.”</p><p>“Who’s showing off?” Rio flashes a smirk, rearranges herself into a front split, casually. “I’ll get you where you need to be, baby, don’t worry.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Mm.” Rio slowly pulls herself up from the floor, rising to her feet to find she has an inch or two on Agatha. Well, everyone always seems taller on tv, she supposes. “Agatha. How would you like to start?”</p><p>Agatha scoffs, but doesn’t back away, even though they’re probably too close for a first-time meeting. “I’m pretty sure you’re the expert here. All I need is to know how to look like I’ve danced before.” From what Lilia’s told her, Agatha is playing a retired dancer coaching some underprivileged ingenue into greatness. A feel-good film. A simple role for Agatha.</p><p>“Sure.” Rio replies easily. “Maybe we start with the basics, then.”</p><p>Agatha just looks at her expectantly. Rio sort of, maybe, wants to push her buttons. She figures Agatha looks pretty hot all riled up.</p><p>“Not sure that getup is going to work, though.” She gestures to Agatha’s no doubt expensive robe. “What have you got going on underneath?”</p><p>“Excuse me?” Agatha’s voice has an edge to it, but Rio can see the smile tug at the corner of her mouth. God, she’s praying Rio’s her type, even a little bit. She wants to know what that mouth feels like under her teeth. It’s deeply unprofessional of her.</p><p>“Dance clothes.” Rio says, as if that’s what she’s meant all along. “Or a workout outfit? Anything like that would work. From what Lilia says, you like to come…prepared.”</p><p>Agatha sighs, reaching for the tie of her robe and unknotting it, clearly taking her time. Rio watches her hands, admiring the curve of her fingers, the dexterity with which she disrobes. Purple silk pools to the floor, revealing a tight black leotard with no nods to modesty aside from a sheer purple wrap skirt. Rio approves.</p><p>She’d approve even more if Agatha had been naked, but that’s a step for later.</p><p>“So, any dance experience at all?” Rio asks casually, as if she hadn’t read Agatha’s “Education” blurb on her wikipedia page extensively. She glances back at Agatha as she walks across the room to retrieve the barre, as if it’s easy for her eyes to come and go. As if they’re not drawn to Agatha at every moment.</p><p>“Only when I was a girl. My mother was obsessed with debutante traditions.” Agatha’s voice is hard. It’s actually fairly common knowledge that Agatha and Evanora Harkness no longer have much of a relationship, despite working in prominent positions in the same industry. There’s clearly resentment there. “But I’m assuming outdated heteronormative pair dancing doesn’t have much to do with ballet.”</p><p>Rio shrugs a shoulder, positions the barre in the center of the room. “I wish I could tell you ballet was based in gay abandon, but not quite. You don’t need to worry about partner dancing, though, so I suppose it’ll all be new to you.”</p><p>“I’m a quick study.” Agatha strides up to the barre like she belongs there, directly opposite from Rio. Her eyes drop down Rio’s body, and Rio likes the smile on the actress’s lips. “So, Rio, what’s next?”</p><p>Rio grins, drapes her body over the bar, getting in Agatha’s space just a little. “You let me take care of you, sweetheart.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Rio laughs.</p><p> </p><p>–</p><p>They spend hours going over basics. It turns out Agatha is a determined student, her movement precise, her attitude demanding. She expects perfection of herself - and Rio, too. It’s a little serious, but Rio does manage to slip in some flirting here or there. Agatha answers only with a little twitch of the lips. It’s not quite enough for Rio, but she’ll take it…for now.</p><p>Rio loses track of time, and finds herself surprised when there’s a knock on the door. Agatha is interesting; focused as she is, the older woman is full of little tales about her life in the industry. Tales of Lilia, too, things even Rio hasn’t heard before. Commentary on art and modern media, little snippets about her son and his burgeoning love for gardening, and Rio eats up every word.</p><p>Which is why her first instinct is to tear the head off of whoever’s interrupted them. Luckily for the person in question, it’s one of Rio’s favorite people.</p><p>“Alice.” She beams as the petite woman enters the room, a softer answering smile on her face.</p><p>“So you two know each other? Rio Vidal, with so many mutual friends, where have you been all my life?” Agatha’s grin is smooth. She steps back from the barre easily, moving towards where she’d left her robe as if she’s not even waiting for the answer.</p><p>“Waiting in the wings, my love.” Rio teases, before moving towards the door to embrace Alice. Alice looks at her with some skepticism, her eyes flickering towards Agatha in an unspoken question. Rio just laughs. Alice knows her type, and Alice knows she moves fast. Why should she be surprised? Because Agatha’s famous, and famously cold?</p><p>No one can resist Rio.</p><p>“Alice and I go way back.” Rio winks, and Alice rolls her eyes.</p><p>“She means we know each other through Lilia. Like everyone.” Alice turns to Agatha. “Ready to go? You’ve got hair and makeup waiting.”</p><p>“And Billy is where, exactly, that he had to send my bodyguard in his stead?” Agatha shrugs on her robe, much to Rio’s disappointment. She joins Alice, sparing a glance for Rio. “I have an event tonight, so it seems we’re wrapped for today, Miss Vidal.”</p><p>“The heart breaks.” Rio says dramatically, with a smile on her lips. “I’m probably due at evening rehearsal myself, Miss Harkness.”</p><p>Rio sees Alice look between them, hears her sigh. It makes her want to giggle.</p><p>“See you tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio lets Agatha go with a little wave, watching her as she precedes Alice out the door. Alice gives her a look before she leaves, a look Rio just smirks to in reply.</p><p>She ignores the text she receives 10 minutes later, too.</p><p>
  <b>Alice: </b>don’t mess with agatha<br />
<b>Alice:</b> seriously, rio, she’ll break your heart<br />
<b>Alice:</b> rio??<br />
<b>Alice:</b> fuck
</p><p>
  <b>–</b>
</p><p>
  <b><b>Alice Wu-Gulliver </b>: Lilia, this is all your fault. Isn’t Rio your goddaugther??<br />
<b>Lilia Calderu</b>: Alice, dear, this is going to be fine.<br />

  <p>Agatha studies herself carefully in the mirror, warmed over by well-designed glamor lighting that only enhances the expert job Jennifer has done on her makeup. She reaches up to adjust one of the curls framing her face, moving it just enough that her teardrop pearl earrings are visible.</p><p>It’s a pretty picture. Poised, elegant, all dark jewel tones and sharp cheekbones. But for once, she’s not focused on perfecting a public image. She’s not thinking about Nicky staying overnight with Wanda and Billy and Tommy, something that usually provokes her overprotective nature despite her (hard-earned) trust in the Maximoff family.</p><p>No, she’s thinking about <i>her</i>.</p><p>Doubtlessly it’s what Rio wanted. Agatha could see it in her eyes from the moment they met. It’s easy for Agatha to tell when someone wants her, and Rio wasn't even subtle about it. Foolish and brash, maybe, but crystal-clear in intention.</p><p>She frowns a little. It’s not that she hasn’t had beautiful women throw themselves at her before, but usually it’s all fun and games. Agatha doesn’t do romantic relationships. She has her career, she has Nicky, she has old friends who tolerate her ceaseless perfectionism and dramatic demands. She doesn’t need, or want, a love life.</p><p>Blowing off steam now and again, though, that’s a different story.</p><p>But she’s unsure about Rio. Sure, the younger woman clearly wants to fuck her, but there’s something a little too tempting about it. Rio could be dangerous. Agatha’s got a creeping suspicion that they’re similar - that Rio could end up drawing her in and spitting her out before Agatha has a chance to do the same thing herself.</p><p>That Rio could hurt her.</p><p>She scoffs at her own reflection. It’s ridiculous, of course. She’s nearly fifty and no woman has yet managed to break her heart. No one can wrap Agatha Harkness around their pretty little finger. Agatha just - doesn’t care that much. She doesn’t.</p><p>Her hand reaches for her phone. She obviously just needs to get Rio out of her system. It’s been a long time, that’s all. Too long.</p><p><b>Agatha</b>: Lilia, get Rio an invitation for tonight.<br />
<b>Agatha:</b> Honestly you probably ought to get her a dress too. Does she know how many holes her tights have in them?<br />
<b>Agatha: </b>Make Billy do it.</p><p> </p><p><b>Agatha to Billy:</b>Make it green.</p><p><b>Lilia to Alice: </b> Everything is going exactly to plan.</p><p>–</p><p>Rio can’t say she follows how doing a simple favor for her godmother ended up with her in a (rented) designer gown, on her way to a red-carpet event, her understudy currently warming up to take Rio’s place in the company’s evening performance.</p><p>Lilia is probably a witch, Rio reasons.</p><p>The dress makes her ass look incredible, and the town car that has been sent for her is helpfully equipped with a cute little bottle of champagne. Even better, Alice is the one driving. Rio’s beaming when she realizes it, Alice rolling down the partition with an expression that is not nearly as cheerful.</p><p>“You’ve got no idea what you’ve gotten yourself into.” She says, pulling the car smoothly out of Rio’s driveway. “I mean it, Rio, this time - seriously. You’ve met your match.”</p><p>“We’ll see about that.” Rio trills, busy unwrapping the little metal covering on the miniature champagne bottle. She laughs as she pops out the tiny cork, and takes a large sip. “This dress is nice. Wish I could keep it.”</p><p>Alice sighs heavily. “I’m just saying prepare yourself.” She falls quiet for the rest of the drive, and Rio doesn’t make an attempt at starting conversation. As much as she wants to pick her brain for info on Agatha - and seriously, Alice has been her friend for years, and she’d never mentioned how fucking hot her boss was? - Rio’s mind is whirling over what to expect for tonight. She can’t say she’d  thought Agatha was going to be so bold as to invite her to a movie premiere only hours after meeting her.</p><p>When the car stops again, Rio’s surprised to find they’re idling on the curb in a quiet neighborhood, rather than surrounded by event photographers and bustling crowds. She looks up the drive to see a door crack open, and then it makes sense: she’s not meeting Agatha Harkness at the event. She’s her <i>date</i>.</p><p>Rio beams.</p><p>Alice jumps out of the car, opening the backdoor as Agatha makes her way down the driveway. Rio crosses her legs deliberately, letting the silk fall open, plenty of skin visible through the long slit in the fabric. Her eyes light up as she takes in Agatha’s own dress. It’s modest in comparison to Rio’s, but vibrant and flattering. She’s like a queen.</p><p>Agatha meets Rio’s eyes as she slides into the seat next to her.</p><p>“Thanks for the invite.” Rio says, and holds out the half-finished champagne. Agatha lets out a soft laugh and accepts it, raising it to her lips while making direct eye contact.</p><p>“I figured you could use a night out after all that hard work this afternoon.”</p><p>“And you could use the company?” Rio prompts, reaches out a hand and settles it on Agatha’s thigh. She can see Alice practically groan as she closes the door on them.</p><p>Agatha makes no move to dislodge Rio’s hand. She tilts her head to the side, just gazing at Rio as Alice starts the car.</p><p>“The company’s not half bad.” Agatha says finally, a grin playing on her red lips.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Billy </b>: Alice I’m scared, Agatha was smiling, like, a lot this afternoon and she made me buy a dress for that frankly scary dancer lady?? I don’t understand<br />
<b>Alice </b>: I know, billy, I know.</p><p> </p><p><b>Billy </b>: ALICE, TWITTER’S LOSING IT</p><p> </p><p><b>Billy </b>: alice tell rio to please please stop touching agatha’s ass with photographers present oh MY GOD<br />
<b>Alice</b>: you’ve met rio<br />
<b>Billy </b>  : …yeaH?<br />
<b>Alice </b> : you think I can tell her what to do?<br />
<b> Billy</b>: point taken<br />
<b>Billy </b> : (link sent: Is Agatha Harkness finally taken? Everything we know about the stunning brunette on the actress’s arm)<br />
<b>Billy </b> : god works fast but buzzfeed works faster<br />
<b>Alice </b>: oh this is bad</p><p> </p><p><b> Jennifer </b>: WAS NO ONE GONNA TELL ME AGATHA’S FUCKING LA’S PREMIERE PRIMA?<br />
<b> Billy </b>: la’s what<br />
<b>Jennifer </b>: uncultured swine<br />
<b>Billy </b>: i mean. As far i know they haven’t had sex yet<br />
<b>Alice</b>: christ<br />
<b>Alice </b>: hope the PR department’s having a good night<br />
<b>Lilia </b>: oh, they’re not<br />
<b>Alice </b>: lilia why did you DO THIS<br />
<b>Lilia </b>: all in good time, dear</p><p>–</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s having a great night. In fact, she’s starting to realize that she’s been living a stagnant existence for weeks up until today. She’s been bored. Her routine is (by necessity) full of structure that chafes at the little chaos demon that truly lives in Rio’s heart. She wakes up, she attends rehearsal, she eats, she performs, she sleeps. She dances. And she loves it, she really does.</p><p>But it’s become expected. It’s all so…normal. It’s boring as fuck.</p><p>And Agatha is anything but boring. She leads Rio onto the red carpet as if the younger woman belongs there, as if this is something Agatha does all the time (she doesn’t, as far as google can tell Rio), as if they’re…dating. Maybe they are. Maybe this is how Agatha asks people out.</p><p>Flashbulbs go off the second the press spot Agatha; the chatter from the photographers and reporters is so loud, overlapping enough that Rio can barely make out any individual words. She can read the surprise in several expressions, though, the excitement born from the hunger for a story. Who is she? She’ll never tell.</p><p>With a grin, she wraps an arm around Agatha’s waist, utterly shameless. She ignores the questions yelled at her, and Agatha does too.</p><p>Rio likes the idea of letting them all wonder.</p><p>The carpet is a whirlwind and then they’re inside, settling into plush seats under dim lighting. There’s plenty of chatter around them, but no one interrupts as Rio turns her body to face Agatha’s fully. She lets her hand settle on Agatha’s knee.</p><p>“Enjoying yourself?” Agatha asks casually. Her gaze is steady on Rio’s, not even dropping to her chest a little bit. Rio leans forwards deliberately.</p><p>“You know I am. But you surprised me.” Rio replies, cheshire cat smile lighting up her face. “I didn’t expect - this. In front of everyone.”</p><p>“Oh, you wanted a secret rendezvous?” Agatha leans in a little bit, dropping her voice. “I know what you wanted the second I walked through that door. I bet you were imagining me taking you up against that mirror in the rehearsal room with your leg over your head, huh?” Rio’s mouth goes a bit dry. She’s hanging onto Agatha’s words shamelessly. “Maybe someday, hon. But a woman needs a little foreplay.”</p><p>“So showing me off is your foreplay?” Rio’s voice is a little husky. Agatha’s gaze is so, so innocent. She really is a good actress. “Getting people to talk? I know you don’t…date. Like this.”</p><p>Agatha laughs, head tilting back and exposing the gorgeous line of her throat. “Ah. You did your research.” She shrugs a shoulder. “You’re not the first I’ve brought on the carpet, dear.”</p><p>“But -”</p><p>“I have a good PR team. But it has been awhile.” Agatha’s smile is deadly. Rio feels her hand slip over Rio’s on her knee, fingers intertwining. “A long while.”</p><p>“Well, I’m honored to be here.” Rio’s words are sincere, a true excitement fluttering in her chest. Her initial intentions with Agatha may have been - less than pure, but she actually finds the woman charming. Interesting. Maybe someone she’d like to get to know.</p><p>It’s kind of new for her.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Agatha</b>: Billy, order roses. I’ll forward you the address.<br />
<b>Billy </b>: roses?<br />
<b>Agatha </b>: I’m texting so I know I didn’t stutter. 12 roses. Dark red.<br />
<b>Billy </b>: right. Sure. yeah of course right away<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: How do you manage to ramble in a text message?</p><p>–</p><p><b>Billy </b>: we’re all screwed i think?<br />
<b>Alice </b>: yeah billy, i know</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Agatha’s grinning over her tablet during breakfast, scrolling smoothly past all the links speculating on her and Rio’s red carpet appearance last night. It’s only been 12 hours and there’s already a handful of articles - and dozens more tweets - dedicated to uncovering Rio Vidal’s identity and the nature of her relationship to Agatha. The same ten photos cycle through the articles, Rio and Agatha pressed side-by-side on the carpet, looking immaculate together in complementary colors. Agatha’s favorite is the one where Rio’s hand has clearly drifted a little further south then is strictly appropriate.</p><p>Nicky sits across from her at the dining table, happily munching on fruit loops. “Mama,” he begins slowly. Agatha’s eyebrow perks up, wary. “Mama, who is Rio?”</p><p>“Now where did you hear that name?” Nicky’s only six, he’s not allowed any social media of his own, but he’s family friends with the Maximoff twins - two seventeen year old boys who certainly have enough tech savvy and portable devices between the two of them to have had an influence on her son. She sighs, fairly certain of what’s gone on here. Maybe she should have never hired Teen. But beyond being a favor to Wanda, Billy has some real talent. And an excellent eye for women’s fashion, as it turns out.</p><p>“Billy was all busy last night looking at his phone, and Tommy said Billy wouldn’t play with us because he was busy doing his job - but he works for you so I said, that’s silly, because mama is at a movie and she doesn’t need Billy. But then Billy said you did need him, because you and Rio were gonna be a ‘big deal’ and he needed to know what was going on.” Nicky seems to be determined to get as many words out as quickly as possible without taking a single breath. “So. Who’s Rio? Is she a big deal?”</p><p>“Hm.” Agatha considers her words carefully. She’s a public figure, but she’s never wanted that to affect her son any more than she could help. “You could say that. She’s a very important ballet dancer, and I’m working with her for my new movie.”</p><p>“Ohh. Cool, I guess.” Nicky nods with understanding, returning to his fruit loops as if no further explanation is necessary. Agatha is relieved. She’s not quite sure where things are going with Rio, but she knows Nicholas doesn’t need to be involved. He’s never met any of her…paramours, and there’s no need for any exceptions to that rule. Agatha doesn’t need anyone permanent in her family but her son.</p><p>Still, she finds herself looking forward to today’s on-set practice in a way she hasn’t in some time. Agatha is incredibly grateful for her job - she finds it fulfilling, of course, and creative, and it definitely doesn’t pay half-bad. But this movie she’s doing now? It’s a paycheck, more or less. Rio is the thing that makes it exciting.</p><p>There’s a soft tap on the door before it opens, revealing Wanda striding in without waiting for an answer. She doesn’t need to. She’s Agatha’s best friend, and Nicholas’s godmother. She’s had keys for the house since before Agatha even adopted Nicky - and Agatha doesn’t even <i>knock</i> when she goes over to Wanda’s.</p><p>There’s a mischievous light in Wanda’s eyes, and Agatha’s already rolling her own eyes before Wanda can speak.</p><p>“I was just telling Nicky about how I’m working with the ballet dancer Rio Vidal for this movie, Wanda.” She says pointedly, nodding to Nicky. Wanda sighs as if disappointed to be cut short on her gossip. Agatha’s going to have to prepare herself for a text-based barrage later. She’s surprised Wanda has held off this long.</p><p>“Of course.” Wanda says smooth enough, flashing a grin at Nicky. “Are you ready for the drive to school, little one?”</p><p>“I gotta grab my backpack!” Nicholas bounds out of his seat and scurries off towards his room, full of the energy only children currently processing a bowl full of simple carbs and sugar have. Wanda immediately rounds on Agatha.</p><p>“She’s not just a ballet dancer.”</p><p>“Well, people are rarely just their career, Wanda darling. As you and I both know.” Agatha puts down her tablet, meeting Wanda’s inquisitive gaze with a bland sort of expression. She refuses to let on just how much she wants to talk about Rio. She’s teased Wanda enough for how much she talks about Vision, after all.</p><p>It’s a hard life being a single gal who’s best friends with Hollywood’s golden couple, truth be told. They’re so in love it’s actually disgusting, and she can’t count the number of Vision’s friends who’ve tried to hit on her. She’s not sure what she has to do to convince Hollywood's elite lineup of male actors in their 40s and 50s that she’s extremely gay, and no, not even a little bit interested thanks.</p><p>She was the goddamn host of LA’s last pride parade last year, for crying out loud.</p><p>She wore a <i>rainbow pantsuit</i> on her first ever late night interview.</p><p>Agatha hopes getting felt up by a ballerina on the red carpet might help, but she’s fairly sure history will call it “gal pals” in due time.</p><p>“Agatha, come on. You haven’t dated in ages.”</p><p>“Who says I’m dating now?”</p><p>“Agatha. I saw the pictures, everyone saw the pictures, and you brought her on the carpet. That’s like, second base for you. Like, emotionally, past meeting the parents' level.”</p><p>“Mm, no bases crossed, although I suppose it depends on if you count the way she poses for pictures. Quite feisty, that one.” Agatha grins, and stands up from her seat. “And there’s no chance in hell Rio is ever meeting Evanora - that’s for her own sake.”</p><p>“You’re seriously not going to tell me anything?” Wanda prods, smile faltering just a little.</p><p>“Wanda. There’s nothing to tell. I was having some fun.” Agatha spots her car pull up in the driveway, Alice reliably at the wheel. Maybe she needs to ask that one about her friendship with Rio Vidal. “And I’m probably going to go and have some more. Don’t worry about it. And don’t mention it to Nicky.”</p><p>“Agatha. I think you actually like this one.”</p><p>“And how would you know that? It’s not like you can read my mind, hon.” Agatha sighs. “I’ve got to go. Text me after you drop off Nicky? Thank you again for driving him. I hate leaving him with drivers I don’t know well, and Alice is needed on set today.”</p><p>Wanda softens, reaches out to hug Agatha briefly. Agatha isn’t one for demonstrative displays of affection, and Wanda knows that. “Of course, Ags. I love Nicky like my own.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Please don’t make Billy cry today.”</p><p>“Who, <i>me</i>? Never.” Agatha runs into Nicky on the stairs, giving him a kiss on both cheeks before she’s out the door, a definite bounce in her step.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Alice</b>: i hate you<br /><b>Rio </b>: not a chance, baby. You love me.<br /><b>Alice</b>: agatha straight up interrogated me about you the entire drive to set. I hate you. I never want to hear your name again<br /><b>Rio</b>: ooh! What did you say? Please tell me you told her i’m the world’s best kisser<br /><b>Rio</b>: alternatively, that I am absolutely covered in extra nipples. maybe she’ll want to investigate<br /><b>Alice</b>: i’m blocking ur number<br /><b>Rio</b>: tell her i have secret tattoos!!! Tell her she gets a gold star if she finds one today!<br /><b>Alice</b>: i. Hate. you.<br /><b>Rio</b>: this is the best day ever.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Wanda</b>: Agatha, I spoke to Lilia. I really think this Rio is someone special.<br /><b>Wanda</b>: I mean, obviously, she’s a superstar dancer but I mean special to you.<br /><b>Wanda</b>: or she could be. She could be good for you.<br /><b>Wanda</b>: Agatha, please be nice to her.<br /><b>Agatha</b>: Wanda, you don’t even know her.<br /><b>Wanda</b>: I never bet against Lilia.<br /><b>Agatha</b>: I promise to be a good girl, Wanda.<br /><b>Wanda</b>: I mean give her a chance - a real chance.<br /><b>Wanda</b>: For me?<br /><b>Agatha</b>: Nice try.</p><p> </p><p>Thankfully, Billy is once again there to lead Rio to the rehearsal room buried in the depths of the studio’s maze of sets and various special rooms containing god knows what.<br />The room isn’t empty this time, however. Blessedly, Agatha is already there, glowing even though Rio knows exactly how late a night she had. Turns out movie premieres aren’t exactly a brief affair. (also, the movie was terrible, but it really didn’t matter seeing as Rio’s focus was seeing how high she could slide her hand on Agatha’s leg before she got playfully batted away)</p><p>“Honey, I’m home.” Rio jokes, cat-who-caught-the-canary grin on her lips. She practically pushes Billy out of the doorway and shuts the door. “Bye, Teen!”</p><p>“Someone’s eager to get to work.” Agatha comments dryly. She’s dressed simply today, black leggings and a purple sports bra, but she still looks devastating. Rio’s in an absolute jumble of mismatched dance gear.  With a rose tucked behind her ear, naturally.</p><p>“If I get to work <i>on</i> - oh, sorry, with - you, why wouldn’t I be?”</p><p>“Point taken.” Agatha grins, steps closer, chin tilted towards the mirrors. “Are you still thinking about what I said last night?”</p><p>“Is that offer on the table today?”</p><p>“I don’t know, do you think you’ve earned it?”</p><p>A spark of lighting shoots straight down Rio’s spine. She thinks she knows the game they’re playing. She’s about ready to get on her knees, but she’s never made it that easy for anyone before.</p><p>“Maybe we should warm up first.” Agatha says, casual as if their flirting had just been professional conversation. “Help me stretch?”</p><p>“Oh, gladly, sweetheart.”</p><p>“It’s still Agatha.”</p><p>“I don’t know, I think you like it, mi amor.” Rio’s teeth flash, predatory and playful at once. “Come on, Agatha, let’s get on the floor.”</p><p>Agatha practically cackles. “You move fast, <i>sweetheart</i>.” But she complies, following Rio down to the floor and letting the younger woman arrange her limbs in a series of increasingly gratuitous stretches. Neither of them is under any illusion that this is anything but extended foreplay. Rio’s hands press into Agatha’s lower back as she guides her to fold over her legs, gently kneading, tips of her nails pressed in just a little. The groan Agatha lets out isn’t due to the tightness in her hamstrings at all.</p><p>Rio slides her hands up Agatha’s back, moving up her body with all the grace and sedate pace of a snake. Fingertips curl around Agatha’s shoulders. Rio lets her chest press into the older woman’s back, savoring the feeling of closeness, the risk of what they’re doing at work of all places.</p><p>“Agatha,” she whispers close to Agatha’s ear, feels gratified by the shiver that runs down the actress’s spine. “Is this okay?”</p><p>“Rio, come on -” There’s tension born of impatience in Agatha’s voice, and Rio smirks.</p><p>“Okay, baby, be patient. I’ll take good care of you.”</p><p>Rio leans down, her hand brushing long strands of dark hair out of the way so she can - finally - press her lips to Agatha’s neck. God, she’s been waiting to taste her. She feels almost high on the way Agatha sighs and tilts her head, giving over more skin for Rio to worship.</p><p>She slides a hand down, gripping at Agatha’s waist. She wants to ravish her, pull her up and flip her around, get her lips where she really wants them. Rio’s never been this excited for a simple kiss. Although she suspects things are about to get far from simple.</p><p>“Let me see you, baby,” she prompts, and it’s a little messy - a tangle of limbs as she guides Agatha to face her. Agatha ends up kneeling in between Rio’s legs with Rio’s hands all that’s holding her up, but it doesn’t matter. The anticipation is more important than the elegance of it all. She feels Agatha’s hands slide into her hair and grip hard, those long fingers going to work in just the way Rio wanted, nails scratching at her scalp in such a delicious sensation.</p><p>Agatha leans in, Rio pauses, savoring it. She wants to make Agatha need it, wants to make them both crazy with it. A grin plays on her lips as she pulls back just a little.</p><p>“Agatha…” She teases, looking down at Agatha’s half-closed eyes. She’s so ready for this.</p><p>“Shut up.” Agatha hisses softly, but she’s smiling too. She leans in again, and Rio moves to meet her.</p><p>Which is when the rehearsal room door opens.</p><p>Agatha groans as Rio falls back, settling onto her hands and leveling a glare at the door. Their interruption comes in the form of Billy Maximoff, naturally, gaping at them like a deer in the headlights.</p><p>“Uh -”</p><p>“For god sake, Teen, you’re going to catch flies with your mouth like that.” Seeming absolutely unbothered, Agatha untangles herself from Rio as smoothly as she can, rising to her feet and brushing imaginary wrinkles from her leggings. “What is it?”</p><p>“You … have an appointment with costuming?”</p><p>“Is that a question?”</p><p>“It’s in 10 minutes.”</p><p>“Well, best not leave Jenny Kale waiting, huh?” Agatha sighs, glancing down to Rio, who’s happily watching her from the ground. “Why don’t you show Rio to my trailer while I’m getting fitted, Billy.”</p><p>Billy’s eyes are wide. “Um, but don’t you - I mean - want to get back to your rehearsal?”</p><p>Agatha snorts. “Teen, don’t be dense. It’s not a good look.” She breezes past Billy in the doorway, looking back over her shoulder at Rio only briefly. “I’ll see you in twenty minutes.”</p><p>Rio beams.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Billy</b>: I AM SCARRED FOR LIFE<br /><b>Alice</b>: slow down<br /><b>Alice</b>: what happened??<br /><b>Billy</b>: rio and agatha!!! WERE NOT REHEARSING<br /><b>Jennifer</b>: oooh tell us more<br /><b>Alice</b>: or don’t<br /><b>Jennifer</b>: don’t be a spoilsport<br /><b>Jennifer</b>: is this why agatha looked like she was gonna set the costuming department on fire when she walked in? You interrupted her fun??<br /><b>Billy</b>: SCARRED . for . life.<br /><b>Jennifer</b>: oh please, it can’t have been that bad<br /><b>Jennifer</b>: anyway i wouldnt worry<br /><b>Jennifer</b>: probably gonna be a pretty short life if agatha’s mad at you<br /><b>Billy</b>: oh god did she say she was mad at me??<br /><b>Jennifer</b>: i don’t know billy why don’t you tell us exactly what you interrupted<br /><b>Alice</b>: OR AGAIN, don’t<br /><b>Lilia</b>: I’m fairly certain you’re all meant to be working right now.<br /><b>Jennifer</b>: why don’t you tell that to Agatha?<br /><b>Lilia</b>: She’s on break.<br /><b>Jennifer</b>: yeah, I’ll bet.<br /><b>Jennifer</b>: hey Lilia, want to tell us more about Rio? Is she spicy enough to handle our Agatha?<br /><b>Alice</b>: i’m leaving this chat<br /><b>Billy</b>: i’m leaving this planet, probably</p><p>–</p><p><b>Billy</b>: mom please don’t let agatha hurt me<br /><b>Wanda</b>: what???</p><p>–</p><p><b>Wanda</b>: not sure what’s going on but just a reminder i know where you live and billy is my precious baby<br /><b>Agatha</b>: of course, toots.</p>

  <p>Agatha’s trailer is nice. That’s not a surprise. Rio is sure Agatha is a woman who is used to luxury, hard-earned and well-deserved.</p><p>She grins at Billy as he drops her off, an almost feral expression meant just to unsettle the boy. It’s a delight how nervous he is. She waves him off happily as he begins to explain the trailer’s amenities - snacks, drinks, a tv with full streaming access. Deeply unimportant compared to Rio’s inspection of just how plush the couch is.</p><p>“You can go now, Billy.” Rio interrupts. “Bye bye.”</p><p>His shoulders drop. “Please hang a sock on the door or something. Ok. Bye.” He rushes out, and Rio watches from the small window as he frantically pulls out his phone and starts typing. She laughs. Everyone’s gonna know about this by lunchtime. She looks forward to Alice’s admonition.</p><p>But for now…</p><p>Rio looks around the trailer casually, and ends up drawn towards a flash of purple hanging on the back of the bathroom door. Agatha’s robe, the no doubt expensive creation she’d been wearing when they first met. Her hand reaches out to brush the silk material. It’s cool under her skin. Her face lights up with a, frankly, brilliant idea.<br />
–</p><p><b>Alice</b>: goddamnit rio<br />
<b>Alice</b>: you're traumatizing teen<br />
<b>Rio</b>: *devil emoji*<br />
<b>Alice</b>: i stg<br />
<b>Alice</b>: i hope u know what ur getting into<br />
<b>Rio</b>: oh, i definitely do<br />
<b>Rio</b>: agatha harkness’s pants<br />
<b>Rio</b>: im getting into her pants<br />
<b>Alice</b>: I’m gonna throw my phone into a fire</p><p>–</p><p>Agatha can be a patient woman, she really can. She took her time with her career - not rushing, not pushing, waiting until she was ready and the world was ready for her. And then she took them all by storm. She’s good at executing a plan, at strategizing, and taking things step by step. She’s been described as calculating, cunning, even manipulative.</p><p>She feels a distinct lack of patience now, as Jennifer hovers around her and occasionally pricks her with a pin that feels distinctly on purpose. Her hand twitches, fingers curled with tension.</p><p>“Are you done yet?” Agatha asks, barely concealed fury in her tone. She’s relatively certain Jen is dragging this out on purpose.</p><p>“Why, you have somewhere to be?” Jen smirks, and Agatha feels another sharp poke on her thigh. She growls, pulling her body away.</p><p>“Kale, knock it off.” Agatha snaps. She wants to tear this stupid costume off right now, knowing what’s waiting for her in her trailer. “It fits fine.”</p><p>“I think it’s my job to be the judge of that, Harkness.” Jen looks like she’s one step away from sticking her tongue out at Agatha. “Unrelated, how’s Rio? Looked pretty cozy on your arm last night.”</p><p>“That’s absolutely none of your business.”</p><p>“You’re never any fun.”</p><p>“You wouldn’t know fun if it smacked you in your over-moisturized face, Jen.” Agatha says, a sickly-sweet smile on her lips. “Now get this thing off of me or I’ll spill an entire coffee on it.”</p><p>Jen rolls her eyes and slides a final pin into place, her movements unhurried. For all Agatha’s talk, she knows the other woman cares about the job and wouldn’t ruin another person’s hard work like that. Besides, her irritation is hilarious.</p><p>“Okay, Agatha, you’re all set. Don’t go doing anything I wouldn’t do.”</p><p>“Oh, goodie, the world is my oyster as long as I avoid processed foods.” Agatha rolls her eyes, unceremoniously stripping off her costume and changing back into her workout gear. She’s out of the door less than a minute later. Jennifer dives for her phone.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Jennifer</b>: oh it’s definitely happening<br />
<b>Jennifer</b>: i’ve never seen agatha move faster<br />
<b>Alice</b>: lilia, are you SURE about this<br />
<b>Lilia</b>: Why do you all insist on questioning me still?</p><p>–</p><p>Agatha steals a production golf cart to make it back to her trailer in under five minutes. She leaves it parked carelessly outside, a problem for another person (Billy, probably. She should give him a raise).</p><p>She takes just a moment before she opens the door to brush a hand through her hair and readjust her clothes, making sure she looks as good as possible.</p><p>The trailer is silent when she walks in, and a frown furrows her brow. If Rio didn’t stick around...but no, she can feel that the younger woman wants this just as much as Agatha does. She has to be here.</p><p>“Sweetheart, is that you?”</p><p>Agatha feels something like relief when Rio’s words drift over to her from the back of the trailer, where a little alcove and semi-sheer curtain hides a small bed. Her lips curve upwards. Of course.</p><p>“Don’t tell me you started without me, Rio. That wouldn’t be very sporting of you.”</p><p>Rio’s answering laugh is beautiful. Agatha can see a shape moving behind the curtain as she walks forward.</p><p>“Come find out for yourself, baby.”</p><p>She doesn’t need to be asked twice. Agatha reaches out and pushes the curtains aside without hesitation. She’s greeted by a very pretty, tempting little picture. Rio Vidal, in Agatha’s robe, sprawled out on the tiny bed with a dark grace Agatha has come to realize is Rio’s natural state.</p><p>The light in her eyes is devilish. Her hair is all over Agatha’s pillow. It’s as if she’s marking the space, filling some crack in Agatha’s life, and Agatha feels a bit insane for thinking that she looks like she belongs there. Like maybe she’s always belonged there.</p><p>Rio has barely bothered to secure the robe, and it’s clear that her dancewear has been stashed somewhere other than on her body. It makes Agatha’s mouth water.</p><p>“Naughty girl.”</p><p>“Oh, definitely.” Rio sits up in the bed, letting the robe fall off one shoulder. She’s devastatingly gorgeous. It’s been months since Agatha felt temptation like this. Maybe years if she’s honest with herself.</p><p>When Rio reaches for her hands, Agatha gives them over easily. She allows Rio to pull her down onto the bed, on top of her. Her hand reaches up to caress Rio’s cheek, then down the line of her throat, holding her gently down with a press of fingertips against the collarbone.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio murmurs. Her touch against Agatha’s waist is soft. Agatha tosses her head, throwing her hair back from her face in a way she knows is pure seduction. Her legs are around Rio’s waist. This is power.</p><p>“What, no cute nickname?” She teases.</p><p>“Agatha, please.” Rio leans up, but Agatha presses her hand down again, keeping their lips apart with a mischievous grin.</p><p>“Are you begging already? How sweet.” She leans down at last, but keeps her lips just at the corner of Rio’s mouth, the lightest of touches. “You made me wait earlier. Are you sure you’re ready for me?”</p><p>“Yes.” Rio’s voice is all breath. Her body arches up as if seeking more contact from Agatha. It feels wonderful. Agatha wants to sink into it. She wants to take everything Rio will give her, ravish her and stay here all afternoon exploring the different ways in which she can make Rio beg.</p><p>“Okay, hon. Okay.” Agatha softens against Rio, finally leaning in to meet her lips properly. It’s divine. Rio is at once fierce and yielding, surging into her but giving where Agatha takes. Her hands claw up Agatha’s back as if she’s desperate for her. Agatha wants to bite at her lip, so she does, pulling it in between her teeth. Rio’s gasp is everything.</p><p>“God, I hope you locked the door this time.” Rio groans, laughter and desire both in her voice.</p><p>“No one will interrupt us, I promise.” Agatha reaches down blindly for the tie of the robe, yanking it open. “On pain of death.”</p><p>“Can’t say I wouldn’t love watching you tear someone’s head off.” Rio quips, adjusting her body to help Agatha disrobe her, eager to be bared to the older woman. Her hand finds itself toying with the clasp of Agatha’s sports bra. “But I’d rather see this come off.”</p><p>“I know what you want.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Billy</b>: i swear her trailer is moving right now<br />
<b>Jen</b>: don’t come a knocking if the trailer is knocking, ig<br />
<b>Alice</b>: this is not funny. I am not having fun<br />
<b>Jen</b>: speak for urself alice<br />
<b>Jen</b>: i think the director’s gonna have a hernia, actually<br />
<b>Jen</b>: agatha was supposed to be on set fifteen minutes ago<br />
<b>Billy</b>: i’m not going in there<br />
<b>Billy</b>: even my mom won’t be able to protect me if i do<br />
<b>Alice</b>: agatha is going to get her and rio fired isn’t she?<br />
<b>Lilia</b>: No.<br />
<b>Jen</b>: and just like that they're suddenly “filming a different scene today”<br />
<b>Jen</b>: are you a witch, lilia?<br />
<b>Lilia</b>: that’s a very reductive term, Jennifer.<br />
<b> Jen </b>: reductive me the costumes I was meant to have ready two days from now<br />
<b>Alice</b>: what?<br />
<b>Billy</b>: what?<br />
<b>Lilia</b>: Don’t forget dinner at my house tonight, everyone. 🙂<br />
<b>Alice</b>: oh god</p><p>-</p><p>“I’m pretty sure that’s a bite mark on my ear.” Rio remarks, examining herself in the tiny bathroom mirror in Agatha’s trailer. She’s thrilled with herself. Her body hasn’t felt this good in ages, despite how wrecked she looks. The trailer bathroom is a small space, but it doesn’t feel claustrophobic when Agatha crowds in behind her, arms around her waist.</p><p>“And there are two dozen bruises coming up on my neck alone.” Agatha laughs softly. “Jen is gonna go through at least a bottle of foundation on these.”</p><p>“A pretty good day’s work, then.” Rio leans back into Agatha’s embrace. “Looking forward to dinner?”</p><p>Agatha pauses, and Rio can feel her body tense up. “You’re coming to Lilia’s dinner?”</p><p>“Well, yeah, I’m her goddaughter.” Rio says, a question in the furrow of her brow. “That’s how I got this, uh, job.”</p><p>“Right. I knew that, I just - I hadn’t thought about the dinner.” Agatha pulls away, not meeting Rio’s gaze in the mirror.</p><p>“Hey, wait - what happened?” Rio turns to face Agatha, frowning. “You went somewhere just now.”</p><p>Agatha sighs, and Rio watches the tension she’d so painstakingly bled from Agatha’s body creep right back in. “My son is coming to dinner tonight.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio blinks. “Is that all?”</p><p>“What do you mean, is that all? Nicky is six, I don’t know what to tell him about - this -”</p><p>“So don’t say anything.”</p><p>Agatha arches an eyebrow. “And you’d be…okay with that? Pretending like nothing is going on.”</p><p>“Sure, whatever.” Rio shrugs a shoulder, gently brushing past Agatha to grab her clothes from the couch. “Agatha, it’s not that big a deal. I don’t expect to be formally introduced to your family just because we had sex.”</p><p>“Right…” Agatha’s clearly used to a more clingy type of woman, but Rio’s not like that. She can be possessive, but she’s not insecure. She knows what she brings to the table, and beyond that she knows that whatever she’s got going on with Agatha is brand new and just - fun. It’s just for fun.</p><p>“Hey, don’t worry about it, okay?” Rio shrugs into her leotard before leaning over to brush a kiss to Agatha’s lips in reassurance. “I’ll be on my best behavior.”</p><p>“Is that even possible with you?”</p><p>“Baby, I can be a perfect angel. Just you wait.” Rio winks, and Agatha rolls her eyes in response. Rio has to admit Agatha might know her, just a little bit.</p><p>“No flirting in front of Nicky. No touching.” Agatha says sternly. “I keep this part of my life private for a reason. He’s too young to understand it, and I don’t want him getting…attached.”</p><p>A clear sign as any Agatha’s not planning on keeping Rio around once the thrill expires. It shouldn’t sting. It doesn’t sting. Rio knew just what she was getting into, and she wanted it that way. She still does.</p><p>It’s just sex.</p><p>Really good sex with a really gorgeous, smart, powerful, interesting woman.</p><p>That’s all.</p><p>“It’s seriously not a problem, Agatha.” Rio says, finishing getting dressed. “But hey, can I ride with you and Alice? Because I totally took the town car the studio sent me today.”</p><p>Agatha grins. “I’d be delighted to torture Alice some more, hon.”</p><p>–<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: Rio will be there tonight. DO NOT make a big deal out of it.<br />
<b>Wanda</b>: oh my god, I get to meet her?? Billy is TERRIFIED of her, you know.<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: good, he should be<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: Again, this is not a big deal. She’s just there as Lilia’s goddaughter.<br />

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>As a rule, Agatha Harkness does not get nervous. And she’s not nervous right now. Not even a little bit. She’s extremely…fine.</p><p>In all fairness, Rio is the first woman Nicky’s met who Agatha has been…involved with, casual or not. Agatha really doesn’t date much, and even her little dalliances slowed significantly once she adopted Nicholas. Babies take a lot of time, even with a great support system and the ability to afford a good nanny. Besides, Agatha had barely wanted to be away from him at first – she couldn’t have anticipated the anxiety that comes along with being responsible for a life. She didn't understand the fear that lives in your heart when you love something so small and vulnerable that much.</p><p>Agatha glances across the backseat of the town car at Rio, who’s busy scrolling on her phone. She looks utterly relaxed. There is indeed a bright red mark on her ear that <i>maybe</i> Agatha had something to do with. Rio seems to feel her watching, looks up and flashes a grin.</p><p>“You good?” She asks, tone light as if she knows Agatha doesn’t like to be pressed on her emotions. It’s a little off-putting, how easily Rio seems to read her. No one else has had such quick access to Agatha’s mind.</p><p>“I’m fine.” She answers. Agatha can’t help herself from reaching out for Rio. It calms her, holding Rio’s hand. God, she must be thirteen years old all over again. “It’s just -” She takes a deep breath. “Look, my friends can be a lot.”</p><p>“Agatha, I already know Alice and Lilia pretty well, you know.”</p><p>“And they’re the chill ones.” Agatha sighs. “Look, I haven’t been subtle with – this. And don’t get me wrong, I didn’t want to be, but with Nicky…”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it. I’m great with kids, and I won’t get all flirty at dinner, I promise.” Rio reassures her, squeezing her hand. “As far as Nicky knows, I’m just some lady you work with because of Lilia.”</p><p>“Right.” Agatha nods, draws her hand away as the car comes to a stop outside of Lilia’s home. It’s a one-story house, warm and inviting and a little bit whimsical even from the outside. The car door opens shortly thereafter, Alice leaning down to level them both with an exasperated expression.</p><p>“For the record,” she says slowly. “I think you’re both ridiculous.”</p><p>“Thank you for the very helpful input, Alice.” Agatha says, already brushing her words off as she slides out of the car. “I had no idea I signed up for a bodyguard <i>and</i> a therapist.”</p><p>“Technically I’m clocked out right now.”</p><p>“Oh no, however will I cope?” Agatha waves a hand, already walking away from them towards the house. Rio laughs, shaking her head as she gets out of the car.</p><p>“You’re sure you’re okay with this?” Alice asks.</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I be? She’s not my girlfriend.” Rio rolls her eyes. “Alice, stop worrying. I’m good. We’re both good.”</p><p>“Says the girl with the indentation of teeth on her ear lobe.”</p><p>“Oh, right. I misspoke. I’m <i>very</i> good.”</p><p>Alice is still shaking her head as she follows Rio up the path.</p><p>The house is bustling with noise when they both enter, music playing from somewhere in the living room and the clatter of cooking in the kitchen. There’s the giggle of a child somewhere, Billy’s laughter in answer. Jen is hovering around a dining table, busily re-arranging the place settings until they’re perfect while Agatha offers critiques over her shoulder, clearly just to rile her up. She winks over at Rio when she sees her looking.</p><p>Rio takes a deep breath, inhaling the savory, rich scent of Lilia’s cooking. She feels at home.</p><p>“Mama!” Rio nearly trips over a small boy who rushes in front of her, launching himself at Agatha in a clearly well-practiced maneuver. Agatha scoops him up easily, delight warming her expression, love radiating from her every pore. Nicholas, then.</p><p>“Sorry, Agatha, he moves fast.” Billy comes trotting into the room with his twin brother at his heels, a little out of breath. Agatha just laughs.</p><p>“That’s alright, Nicky’s just excited to see his mama, isn’t he?” Agatha looks at her son so softly, it tugs a little bit at Rio’s cold, black heart. The feeling is almost uncomfortable. She shifts her weight awkwardly, trying to avoid Alice’s knowing glance.</p><p>“Hey, Rio.” Billy says, a warm smile on his face. Playful, she snaps her teeth at him, causing him to jump back a foot. It’s true entertainment.</p><p>“Hey, Teen.” She claps a hand down on his shoulder as she passes. “Teen’s brother.”</p><p>“...it’s Tommy.”</p><p>“We just call him Teen 2.” Agatha pipes up, and when she meets Rio’s eyes, some of that sweet warmth from her connection with her son is still there. Rio feels something almost like butterflies in her stomach. She’s got to shake this off.</p><p>“No, we don’t. We call him by his name, Agatha.” A redhead - gorgeous, almost unrealistically so - emerges from the doorway to the kitchen, her tone fond but stern. Rio recognizes her from about a dozen well-known movie posters. “Hi, I’m Wanda.” Wanda’s smile is poised and friendly, but Rio can see the assessing look in her eyes clear as day. “Agatha’s best friend.” There it is. Defensiveness. Rio just smiles in response; Agatha should have people looking out for her. Rio thinks the older woman is a lot more vulnerable than she lets on, sure, but it’s not like <i>Rio</i> could ever break her heart. She’s a plaything to Agatha. Which is all she wants to be, anyway.</p><p>Rio reaches out and shakes the hand Wanda offers to her, Rio’s own smile just as demure on the surface but mischief clear in her eyes. She can see Agatha roll her eyes dramatically beyond Wanda’s shoulder.</p><p>“I’m Rio. Lilia’s goddaughter, Agatha’s dance instructor.” Rio laughs. They haven’t done a lot of <i>instructing</i> past that first day. “Nice to meet you.”</p><p>Agatha clears her throat pointedly, “Well. Now that introductions are made -”</p><p>“But mama, you didn’t introduce me!” Nicky protests as Agatha lets him down onto the floor, hand tugging at her pants. He turns towards Rio, not a hint of the usual shyness of childhood in him. “I’m Nicholas Scratch, Agatha’s son. And you’re the lady from the red carpet whose hand was on my mama’s -”</p><p>“Nicky.” Agatha cuts him off tersely, but Rio can see a slight flush on her cheeks. “Be polite. And you know full well your last name is Harkness.”</p><p>“I am.” He protests, striding over to Rio with all the confidence of his own mother, holding out his hand. “I’m called Scratch on account of I’m a witch, actually.” Nicky says a bit conspiratorially, and Rio grins.</p><p>“Nice to meet you, little witch.” She replies, shaking Nicky’s hand. He’s a charming child. Rio knows just where he gets it from. “I’m Rio.”</p><p>“That means river in Spanish!” He says excitedly, glancing back to Agatha as if to check for her approval.</p><p>“Nicky has a talent for languages.” His mother says, stepping forward to be at his side. “He’s very excited about his Spanish lessons at the moment.”</p><p>Rio’s fluent in Spanish, and almost offers to help tutor him - until she remembers that’s probably overstepping. She’s not even really Agatha’s friend, let alone a person Agatha would want spending copious amounts of time around her son.</p><p>“That’s great, little witch.” She says instead, and avoids meeting Agatha’s eyes as she moves towards the kitchen. Suddenly, all she wants is the comfort of Lilia and her cooking. Rio’s often been her sous-chef through the years, although she has no natural talent with food other than growing it. She hasn’t had enough time to spend with Lilia since being promoted within the ballet company, and she misses it.</p><p>“Oh, hello, dear.” Lilia greets her warmly, bent over a simmering pot on the stove. “Will you grab me the salt?”</p><p>Rio complies happily. The kitchen feels quieter, and some of the tension leaves Rio’s body as she busies herself helping Lilia cook. Lilia doesn’t ask her questions - honestly, Rio’s used to her godmother knowing everything without asking, but it’s refreshing to not be at the receiving end of warnings or curiosity about Agatha for a moment.</p><p>Rio’s not in over her head, and she wishes people would stop assuming she is. Agatha may be powerful and intimidating and absolutely noncommittal, but that’s how Rio likes her women. It’s not a problem. It would only be a problem if Rio had feelings for Agatha, which she does not. Obviously.</p><p>“So. Why’d you ask me to help out with this movie, Lilia?” Rio asks finally. Her godmother tends to have ulterior motives, like she’s pulling strings behind the scenes in some grand plan only she can see. Even when things don’t make sense to the people around her, they always seem to have a way of working out. Rio trusts her absolutely. And she’s appropriately wary of her, too.</p><p>“You’re the best dancer I know, of course.”</p><p>“Agatha didn’t need a superstar dancer. Some studio instructor somewhere could have run her through her ballet positions in ten minutes.”</p><p>“Agatha won’t work with just anyone.”</p><p>“But you knew she’d work with me?”</p><p>Lilia turns to her, a soft smile on her lips. “Rio darling, don’t worry so much. Everything will work out just fine.”</p><p>Rio sighs. “There’s nothing to work out, Lilia. Don’t tell me you’ve bought into this too. I mean, I appreciate that you’re not spouting warnings like Alice or concealed threats like Wanda but - there’s seriously nothing going on.”</p><p>“Hmm.” Lilia reaches over and turns out the stove. “Whatever you say, dear.”</p><p>“I’m serious, Lilia.”</p><p>“Rarely.”</p><p>“Lilia -”</p><p>“But you will be, about this. Just you wait.” Lilia squeezes Rio’s arm as she passes, exiting the kitchen before Rio can argue any further.</p><p>–</p><p>They’re settled at the dinner table before long, Lilia arranging them all with such an expert precision that Rio doesn’t realize what she’s doing until Rio and Agatha are squeezed in side-by-side at the smallest part of the table. Their shoulders brush every time they move.</p><p>It’s torture, a little bit. Despite their fun afternoon, Rio hasn’t quite gotten enough of Agatha Harkness, especially with her so close. She can feel her warmth, can pick up the heady jasmine scent of her, can even feel the softness of her hair as it brushes Rio’s shoulder in an intimate, somehow familiar way. Rio’s holding herself back from reaching out a hand and grabbing Agatha’s thigh under the table.</p><p>At least, she <i>means</i> to hold herself back.</p><p>Agatha’s spine goes ramrod straight as Rio’s fingers curl around her thigh, and Rio can hear her sharp inhale like a gust of wind blowing by her ear.</p><p>Wanda, sitting across the table, furrows a brow. Rio meets her gaze and smiles innocently. She feels Agatha’s hand slide on top of hers, stilling any further movement from Rio.</p><p>“You promised.” Agatha says under her breath, a composed smile pasted on her lips.  Rio leans over, under the guise of reaching across Agatha for the container of parmesan, dropping her voice to a whisper.</p><p>“It’s your fault for being so irresistible, baby.”</p><p>Agatha sighs, but she relaxes her hand on Rio’s. “Behave.”</p><p>“And if I don’t?”</p><p>Agatha’s grin is sharp, and there’s a definite darkness in her eyes. “Then you won’t get a reward.”</p><p>“Who’s getting a reward now?” Jennifer pipes up from the other side of Agatha, a shit-eating grin on her face as if she knows exactly what’s going on, which she probably does.</p><p>“Is reward dessert, mama? Because I think I deserve a reward then.” Nicky pipes up. Rio slides her hand off Agatha’s leg, reminded of the reason why she’s supposed to be on her best behavior. That, and she really would like to find out what Agatha’s idea of a reward would be.</p><p>“Of course you do, Nicky.” Agatha’s smile is so warm. It accents her beauty in a new way, and Rio could look at it for hours, like a painting.</p><p>“I made some lovely little individual mousse cups.” Lilia pipes up. “Agatha, Rio, do you mind grabbing them from the garage fridge?”</p><p>“Of course, Lilia.” Rio catches Alice’s eye as she rises from the table, and her friend raises an eyebrow at her. Rio flashes her a grin. “Come on, Aggie.”</p><p>“It is most definitely <i>Agatha</i>.”</p><p>Agatha trails Rio through the house and out a side door, and it’s barely closed behind them when she feels hands at her waist. Quick and powerful, Agatha presses her up against the closed door, stepping smoothly into Rio’s space.</p><p>“So this is you on your best behavior, Rio?”</p><p>Rio smiles, slow and sweet as honey, sliding her leg forward between Agatha’s. “I’m trying to be a good girl, Agatha, promise.”</p><p>“Is that just because you want a reward?” Agatha’s hand picks up a strand of Rio’s dark hair. She twirls it between her fingers as she meets Rio’s eyes. Her blue eyes are dark as a stormy sea.</p><p>“It’s because I want to please you.” Rio runs a hand down Agatha’s hip and leans in, brushing their lips together. Agatha remains still, but lets her eyes flutter closed.</p><p>“I know you do.” Agatha’s hand in Rio’s hair curls around the back of her head, hauling her in for a more bruising kiss. Rio falls into it, drinking Agatha’s lips in like a cold glass on white on a hot summer day.</p><p>Rio’s just about to slip her hand under Agatha’s blouse when the older woman abruptly pulls back.</p><p>“I don’t think you’ve earned that prize just yet, dear.”</p><p>Rio groans as Agatha turns away, making her way towards the fridge. She watches the swing of Agatha’s hips, and has to bite down on her lower lip to stop herself from throwing caution to the wind and trying to get one more moment with Agatha, here in Lilia’s dusty garage with all their friends - and family - waiting for them. “You’re killing me.”</p><p>Agatha just cackles.</p><p>-</p><p><b>Billy</b>: don’t tell agatha but nicky definitely asked about her hickeys tonight<br /><b>Billy</b>: like mom said nicky isn’t supposed to know but um<br /><b>Billy</b>: does agatha know that<br /><b>Jen</b>: rio was wearing agatha’s lipstick when they came back from ‘fetching dessert’ for 15 minutes<br /><b>Jen</b>: not. subtle.<br /><b>Alice</b>: please tell me you didn’t tell nicky what they were<br /><b>Billy</b>: of course not!! I told him they were bruises from her dance class<br /><b>Jen</b>: well, in a way…<br /><b>Alice</b>: ew<br /><b>Jen</b>: come on alice, it’s kinda hot<br /><b>Billy</b>: S T O P<br /><b>Billy</b>: agatha’s like family<br /><b>Jen</b>: family that can’t remember your name half the time???<br /><b>Billy</b>: teen is a nickname!!<br /><b>Jen</b>: what did she call you when you were five, Boy?<br /><b>Billy</b>: …no<br /><b>Jen</b>: y’all are under some kind of stockholm syndrome with agatha i stg<br /><b>Billy</b>: whatever, you love her too<br /><b>Jen</b>: i tolerate her begrudgingly<br /><b>Jen</b>: she does give good pep talks<br /><b>Jen</b>: and somehow produced an angel of a son<br /><b>Jen</b>: but mostly, right now, she’s entertainment<br /><b>Alice</b>: hey, rio is my friend<br /><b>Jen</b>: tell her to get a therapist<br /><b>Billy</b>: hey!!<br /><b>Lilia</b>: Now Jen, that’s no way to become a bridesmaid.<br /><b>Jen</b>: for WHO?<br /><b>Jen</b>: …Lilia, for who??</p><p>–</p><p>It turns out Nicholas loves Rio. During dessert, he begs her to teach him her favorite words in Spanish. By the time they’ve all settled into Lilia’s living room for after-dinner coffee (hot chocolate in the boys’ case), Nicholas is sitting at Rio’s feet and enthusiastically discussing the little garden he’s begun growing in their backyard. It turns out Rio is not only a talented ballerina, she’s got a green thumb for the ages and an almost encyclopedic knowledge of plants.</p><p>Agatha sits in the armchair by the fireplace, posture stiff as she watches her son with Rio across the room, alarm bells ringing in her head. It doesn’t matter if Nicky knows what Rio is to her, if he’s attached either way. Rio isn’t a permanent fixture in their lives. Agatha would do anything to keep her son from getting hurt. Even at the cost of her own happiness.</p><p>Lilia’s sitting in the chair next to her, and Agatha almost jumps when the older woman reaches out to touch her arm. She may have been a little - hyper focused.</p><p>“They’re sweet together.” Lilia remarks, watching as Nicky grins up at Rio. She’s explaining to him the perfect way to grow tomatoes, one of Nicky’s favorite foods.</p><p>“That’s what I’m worried about.” Agatha says tersely. She breaks her gaze away, and meets Lilia’s calm expression.</p><p>“You shouldn’t be.” Lilia says evenly. “Agatha, this is a good thing.”</p><p>“Your meddling is deeply unwarranted, Lilia.” Agatha’s jaw tightens. This reeks of a set-up, and she’s certainly been clear with her friends about her dating intentions. Which is, she has none. If Lilia was expecting Agatha to get serious with her goddaughter, she should know better. She should never have introduced them at all. “I think it’s time for Nicky and me to head home. It’s late.”</p><p>Lilia sighs softly, but doesn’t protest as Agatha stands up and crosses the room. “Say goodnight, Nicky.” The actress says, pointedly not meeting Rio’s questioning gaze. “It’s almost your bedtime.”</p><p>Nicky looks disappointed, but doesn’t argue. “Goodnight, miss Rio.” He says cheerfully, before standing up and taking his mother’s hand. “Gracias for the help with Spanish, and plants!”</p><p>“Of course, little witch.” Agatha catches Rio’s gentle smile from the corner of her eye, and has to steel herself against it. This is no time to be going soft.</p><p>Nicholas and Agatha say the rest of their goodbyes quickly, and Agatha is tense and restless the whole time. A part of her keeps being drawn back to Rio. She wants to say a proper goodbye to her - her…well, nothing. Rio doesn’t belong to her, not in any way. Still, there’s a thread of possessiveness she feels, a drive to claim her lips in a kiss here and now.</p><p>She takes a deep breath.</p><p>As Nicholas is giving Billy a goodbye hug - the teen fondly ruffling his hair - Agatha feels Rio’s hand gently on her wrist.</p><p>“Everything okay?” The younger woman’s voice is quiet, not pressing.</p><p>“Yeah. Just tired.” She says, short. “I’ll see you soon.”</p><p>“I…have to get back to work with the company. I don’t know when I’ll be able to come back to set again, do you want my number?”</p><p>Agatha should say no. She should be done with this now, before it goes too far.</p><p>She doesn’t say no.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Rio</b>: send nudes<br /><b>Agatha</b>: I should have known you’d be like this.<br /><b>Rio</b>: please agatha my family is starving, my crops are dying<br /><b>Agatha</b>: You’re cute.<br /><b>Rio</b>: so can I see your boobs?<br /><b>Rio</b>: with just one photo you could save a starving orphan<br /><b>Rio</b>: you could achieve world peace<br /><b>Agatha</b>: go to sleep, Rio.<br /><b>Rio</b>: as long as you dream of me, baby.<br /><b>Agatha</b>: Goodnight.</p>

  <p>Rio sends Agatha a good morning text - sans asking for spicy pictures, although she considers sending one herself - but there’s no response. She shrugs it off. Agatha’s a busy woman, and also not her girlfriend. Rio’s a little disturbed that she’s been so…clingy. It’s not like her.</p><p>She has to admit to herself that she maybe likes Agatha. A little bit.</p><p>Rio slips into her favorite coffee shop with her body on autopilot, brain whirring. She knows her order by heart and still stumbles over her words. Rio considers banging her head on the little corner table she and Alice always claim as their own.</p><p>She probably would if Alice wasn’t currently looking at her with that way-too-knowing gaze.</p><p>“I -”</p><p>“Do not say I told you so.” Rio warns, tearing into her blueberry muffin with all the finesse of a five year old. “It’s not a problem.”</p><p>“Rio, you have feelings for her. Anyone with eyeballs could tell that.” Alice’s tone is gentle enough, but brokers no argument. “I’m worried about you.”</p><p>“Alice, I know you’re protective, but you don’t need to worry.” Rio tries to assure her, but the words come out a bit half-hearted. Rio’s not a great liar, even to herself. “It’s … gonna be fine.”</p><p>“Agatha’s the worst commitment-phobe I’ve ever met, Rio.”</p><p>“It’s not like I’m known for my long-term relationships, Alice. I have no room to judge.”</p><p>“I don’t mean it as a judgment, Rio, and honestly - of course I know your history. On the surface, you and Agatha work, but…” Alice pauses, lips pressed together. “I knew you’d like her. She’s right for you in a lot of ways. And I’m not saying she doesn’t like you, but ever since she adopted Nicky she’s been more reclusive than ever. She doesn’t let anyone in.”</p><p>“Yeah, I get it.” Rio sighs. “Look, it’s gonna be fine. Agatha’s probably already done with me. Nothing drawn out, just a fling, and I’ll move on.”</p><p>Alice levels her with a look that is full of the patience that only years of friendship can inspire. She waits.</p><p>“Fine! I’m maybe a little bit obsessed with her.” Rio admits, throwing her hands up. “She’s smart and funny, and hot, and a good mother and maybe a little bit savage and I like her. But I knew what this was going into it.”</p><p>“That doesn’t mean you’re not going to get hurt.”</p><p>“You know, I could just stay away from her from now on.”</p><p>“But you won’t.”</p><p>“I definitely won’t.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Alice</b>: Lilia. I swear. You’d better know what you’re doing this time.<br /><b>Alice</b>: I know how much you care about Rio.<br /><b>Alice</b>: Are you sure it’s going to be okay?<br /><b>Lilia</b>: Trust me, Alice.<br /><b>Alice</b>: I’m trying to, but do you really think Agatha’s going to change?<br /><b>Lilia</b>: She already is.<br /><b>Lilia</b>: Just give her a little more time.</p><p>–</p><p>Agatha has picked up her phone and put it down without doing anything seven separate times in the last hour. Her “good morning sweetheart” text from Rio lies unanswered, but she can’t stop looking at it. She knows Rio’s flirtatious nicknames aren’t…serious, but this text feels different. Wishing her goodnight and good morning? It feels pretty committed to Agatha. Feels like she might be in over her head.</p><p>She can’t help but worry that answering it might be saying yes to an unspoken question, a question Agatha’s not ready to answer.</p><p>A question that terrifies her, because no small part of her wants to say yes, for the first time she can remember.</p><p>Rio Vidal is her kryptonite.</p><p>“Harkness, you really should just text her.”</p><p>It’s Jennifer Kale, of all people, peering over Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“No one asked for your opinion, Kale.” Agatha turns her phone firmly face down on her lap.</p><p>“I can’t help it that you need intervention, and the universe decided it’s me here to save your ass.” Jen shrugs a shoulder. “Besides, you’re in <i>my</i> makeup chair, using up <i>my</i> product on all these hickeys. Are you and Rio teenagers or something?”</p><p>“It’s deeply not my problem that you haven’t gotten laid lately and therefore you are weirdly obsessed with my kissing habits.” Agatha sighs. “And I don’t need intervention.”</p><p>“You need to text Rio back.” Jennifer tilts Agatha’s head slightly, applying more foundation. “It’s what you want to do, anyway.”</p><p>“And how would you know?”</p><p>Jennifer sighs, looking Agatha dead in the eyes.</p><p>“I’m only going to say this once. Agatha. We have known each other for years. I pretend to hate you, you pretend to hate me, but we’re family. I know you well, and I actually do want you to be happy. And Rio? She makes you happy.”</p><p>Agatha’s silent as Jennifer returns to her makeup, processing those words.</p><p>“...Thank you.” She says, finally, so quietly it’s barely audible. Jennifer just smiles in response.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Jennifer</b>: agathario shippers ur welcome<br /><b>Alice</b>: aga what now?<br /><b>Billy</b>: WHAT DID U DO<br /><b>Billy</b>: agatha’s being weirdddddd<br /><b>Jennifer</b>: Is she on her phone?<br /><b>Billy</b>: like, every time we take a break<br /><b>Billy</b>: and she’s SMILING<br /><b>Billy</b>: not even in a scary way<br /><b>Jennifer</b>: my work here is done<br /><b>Alice</b>: what the heck is agathario<br /><b>Billy</b>: it’s like bennifer<br /><b>Alice</b>: WHAT IS BENNIFER<br /><b>Billy</b>: alice do u have the internet<br /><b>Billy</b>: #agathario<br /><b>Alice</b>: i really don’t know if i want to google that<br /><b>Billy</b>: you really should. there’s tiktok edits!!!<br /><b>Alice</b>: you speak in gibberish, teen<br /><b>Sharon</b>: who’s rio<br /><b>Billy</b>: mrs davis???? How did you get in this chat??</p><p>–</p><p><b>Agatha</b>: Good afternoon. I’m sorry it took me so long to reply.<br /><b>Rio</b>: That’s okay…it’s just a text.<br /><b>Agatha</b>: I appreciated it.<br /><b>Agatha</b>: I like hearing from you.<br /><b>Agatha</b>: I like you.<br /><b>Rio</b>: Can I call you?<br /><b>Agatha</b>: I’m on set.<br /><b>Rio</b>: Shit.<br /><b>Rio</b>: I mean, I like you too. I should say that up front.<br /><b>Rio</b>: I just wanted to hear your voice.<br /><b>Rio</b>: Is that crazy? I feel crazy.<br /><b>Agatha</b>: Me too.<br /><b>Rio:</b> We barely know each other.<br /><b>Rio</b>: I don’t usually do this.<br /><b>Rio</b>: And I know you don’t either.<br /><b>Agatha</b>: No, I don’t.<br /><b>Agatha</b>: We should talk, in person.<br /><b>Agatha</b>: Hopefully soon?<br /><b>Rio</b>: Come over to mine tonight?<br /><b>Agatha</b>: Happily. And Rio?<br /><b>Rio</b>: Yeah?<br /><b>Agatha</b>: Feel free to send nudes in the meantime 🙂<br /><b>Rio</b>: I really, really like you.</p><p>–</p><p>Agatha drives herself to Rio’s house. This is just between her and the other woman, and for once, she’s not interested in creating drama and spectacle or having people talk about her. There’s a weight on her chest that’s not entirely unpleasant. She can feel a change in the air, like the way one can scent rain on the breeze before it pours.</p><p>She’s scared.</p><p>Agatha maneuvers the car smoothly into Rio’s driveway and parks. She doesn’t move for a moment. This is like walking a precipice and deciding whether or not she’ll jump. And she only has one chance at making the right decision.</p><p>She reaches for the locket laying on her chest, hands curling over the relief of the triple goddess. It’s her comfort, like a safety blanket she can carry with her at all times. It’s her reminder of Nicholas, and her reminder of family  - family when it’s good. When there’s love there.</p><p>She will never admit it, but Jennifer was right. Rio makes her happy in a way only a very select few people do. And Nicky likes her, too.</p><p>This may be Agatha’s best chance at something she’s denied herself for years. At this elusive, ephemeral thing she’s been claiming she doesn’t even want. Love. Romance. A companion.</p><p>She opens the car door. Steps out. Her movements are slow, but she’s made up her mind. Agatha Harkness has never liked to need anyone. And maybe she’d be okay, if she let go of Rio or pushed her away. Maybe. But it’s not what she wants.</p><p>And she’s selfish, isn’t she? That’s what everyone tells her.</p><p>So why is it so hard for her to just admit she wants Rio?</p><p>Agatha spots a familiar shape moving beyond the curtains in the front window and she inhales sharply. Desire pulses through her, heart picking up an erratic beat.</p><p>The door is cracked open, and Rio steps out onto her front step. Her smile is almost shy. It sits strangely on her face, as if her features are not used to forming such a bashful shape, but she’s so beautiful it hurts.</p><p>They’re not in a movie. Agatha is not about to run across the lawn like one of the heroines she plays, sweeping Rio up in her arms and kissing her as if it’s the last thing she’ll ever do. But she kind of wants to.</p><p>She forces herself to move at a normal pace up the driveway.</p><p>“Hey.” Rio’s voice is soft, a little tentative, but a smile plays at her lips. “Come in.” Rio holds out a hand, Agatha takes it, and then she’s swept into the house.</p><p>The house isn’t overly decorated; it looks more like a waystop than a home aside from the copious plants everywhere. What is apparent is that Rio prefers dark colors, minimal furnishings, and she was not lying about her green thumb.</p><p>“Cute plants.” Agatha remarks, but she’s distracted by the way Rio’s thumb is moving over the back of her hand.</p><p>“I’ll take you on a tour sometime. For now…can we talk?”</p><p>“Any chance you happen to have wine?”</p><p>Rio laughs softly, tugs Agatha towards the kitchen. “Yeah, sweetheart. Sure.”</p><p>The quiet as Rio pulls out wine glasses and a bottle of cabernet isn’t uncomfortable, exactly, but the steady thrum of anticipation beneath the surface does itch at Agatha.</p><p>Rio pours them both a healthy amount of wine, before hauling herself up on the kitchen counter to sit in front of Agatha. She holds the glass lightly in one hand, the other hand reaching out to take Agatha’s again.</p><p>“Sorry if it’s cheaper than you’re used to.” She remarks, threading their fingers together. That, more than the taste of the - admittedly low-quality - wine, is what calms Agatha’s pulse.</p><p>“It’s fine.” Agatha steps closer, firmly into Rio’s space, and sets the glass down beside her. “Rio…”</p><p>“If you’re going to crush my heart, just do it quickly.” Rio blurts out, eyes dropping to her lap. Agatha frowns. “I’d understand. I would. But don’t…draw this out.”</p><p>“I told you I like you.” Agatha says, brow furrowed. How could Rio think she was here to hurt her?</p><p>“That doesn’t mean you can commit to this.” Rio sighs. “I’m not even sure if it’s fair of me to ask you to. But…I am. I’d like to give this a real chance. So if you don’t, tell me now.”</p><p>“Rio Vidal, don’t be a fool.” Agatha raises her free hand to cradle Rio’s cheek. She tilts her head up so she can meet her eyes, soft and sweet. “You’ve had me from the moment you met me.”</p><p>Rio surprises a laugh out of Agatha by swearing vehemently (yet somehow cheerfully) in a language the older woman has to assume is Spanish. She’s still laughing when she feels Rio’s lips on her own, swallowing that sound of joy, the only effective method ever made to silence Agatha Harkness.</p><p>-</p><p><b>Billy</b>: hey has anyone been able to get ahold of agatha<br /><b>Billy</b>: it’s just been like, hours since i did and mom says she’s not answering her calls<br /><b>Billy</b>: nicky’s staying with us overnight but he wants agatha to read him a bedtime story<br /><b>Alice</b>: no, I’m off work today<br /><b>Alice</b>: jen?<br /><b>Jen</b>: oh come on, we know where she is<br /><b>Billy</b>: WE do not, that’s why i asked<br /><b>Jen</b>: i told you i took care of things<br /><b>Jen</b>: i bet you i made Lilia proud<br /><b>Billy</b>: can u not be cryptic<br /><b>Jen</b>: she’s with Rio!!!

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>The bed is so warm and cozy in the morning that Agatha resists opening her eyes for several long moments. She breathes in deeply, nose in Rio’s hair, inhaling the scent of petrichor and lily of the valley. Rio’s so soft in her arms, sleep-warm and languid. Agatha feels pleasantly sore but so relaxed. She’s not sure if she’s slept that deeply in years.</p><p>Agatha strokes her hand over Rio’s hip, feeling the dip in the bone with careful fingertips, exploring just to touch. Her lips find Rio’s shoulder, and she begins pressing gentle, lazy kisses against her skin until she feels the other woman begin to stir under her.</p><p>“Sleepy.” Rio murmurs, rolling over in Agatha’s arms to face her. “Sooo sleepy.”</p><p>Agatha laughs gently, pressing a quick kiss to Rio’s nose. “We can stay in bed a little longer.”</p><p>“Mm, how about all day?”</p><p>“I need to pick up Nicky from Wanda’s later.”</p><p>“Fiiine, but I’m only letting you go for the little witch.”</p><p>“You can come with me, if you want.” Agatha can’t help but smile when Rio’s eyes - half-lidded from sleep - light up. She accepts the kiss Rio presses to her lips, sinking into it for just a moment before Rio pulls back.</p><p>“Are you sure?” The younger woman asks, tentative but hopeful.</p><p>“Yeah. I’d kind of like to introduce him to my girlfriend.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio smirks, snuggling in a bit closer. Agatha feels her hand reach up Agatha’s back, playing with her hair. “Your girlfriend? Who’s that? Cuz I don’t remember you asking anyone…”</p><p>“If you need me to beg…”</p><p>“No, baby. Just ask.” Rio twirls long strands of Agatha’s hair around her finger, looking up at her with an expression so tender it makes Agatha’s heart beat just a little bit harder. “All you have to do with me is ask, and I’ll give you anything.”</p><p>“Rio Vidal, will you be my girlfriend?”</p><p>“I don’t know, can we make it wikipedia official?”</p><p>“<i>Rio</i>.”</p><p>“Agatha. Of course. That’s all I want. You’ve got me wrapped around your very talented fingers like no one ever has.” Rio inches her face even closer, brushing their lips together. “Should I make a speech? <i>You have bewitched me, body and soul </i>-”</p><p>Agatha cuts her off with a laugh. Rio grins mischievously, but before she can speak again, Agatha kisses her. The next several minutes are occupied with a slow, lazy sort of kiss, and Agatha takes that time to gently explore Rio’s body without any rush or intent.</p><p>Until her phone starts ringing.</p><p>Rio’s awake enough now to swear when Agatha pulls away and grabs the phone off of the nightstand. She’d left the ringer on last night after missing Wanda’s calls, feeling guilty for not responding to Nicky’s request sooner.</p><p>“Wanda, is everything okay?” She answers the call, sitting up in the bed, careless of the duvet falling down into her lap. It’s nothing Rio hasn’t seen - and marked - before.</p><p>“Yes, Agatha, everything’s fine.” Wanda’s voice is cheerful, and a little too knowing. “Only Nicky wanted to know if you would make it by lunchtime. He wants to make you your favorite, and I told him I’d take him to the store and help him cook if that was okay with you.”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders relax, and she watches out of the corner of her eye as a blessedly naked Rio slips from the bed. “Of course, Wanda. As long as you make enough for me to bring a guest.”</p><p>“A guest?”</p><p>Rio makes her way around the bed, gathering up Agatha’s silk robe as she goes. She leans over Agatha to speak into the phone, “She means a <i>girlfriend</i>!”</p><p>Wanda’s answering laugh is delighted. Agatha only raises an amused brow at Rio.</p><p>“I suppose that robe is yours now?”</p><p>“You like me in it.” Rio winks. “I’m going to go make us coffee.”</p><p>She swans out of the room, Agatha watching her every step of the way.</p><p>“So that worked out, then.” Wanda’s voice pulls her back to her conversation.</p><p>“I suppose it did.” Agatha muses, unable to keep the smile from her face and her voice. “...and yes, you can tell Billy.”</p><p>“He’s going to be so excited.” Wanda says. “And I think Nicky will be, too.”</p><p>“I don’t want to let Nicky down. I might...I might ruin this,” Agatha sighs softly. She’s feeling good, of course, but there’s a part of her that’s still so afraid. “I haven’t had anything like this in so long. What if I drive her away?”</p><p>“Agatha, she’s obsessed with you.”</p><p>“She’s interested now. But you know me, Wanda, I wear on people. I’m selfish. I mess things up.”</p><p>“Hey. Nicky’s kinda one of the greatest kids on the planet, and you’re solely responsible for that one. I think you’re doing okay.” Wanda’s voice is gentle. “And you have so many people who love you. Come on, who’s Agatha Harkness to doubt herself?”</p><p>“I know.” Agatha pulls the blankets up around her shoulders, shielding herself from the chill of the room. “I know, it’s just - this matters.”</p><p>“And that’s what makes it worthwhile. But I know you. You’re pretty good at getting the things you want. I bet you’ll have a ring on that girl’s finger before next year.”</p><p>“Wanda. Don’t get ahead of yourself.”</p><p>“I mean, three or four days in and she almost made you a u-haul lesbian.”</p><p>“I’m going to hang up on you.”</p><p>“Oh, how the tables have turned.”</p><p>“I’ll see you and Nicky at noon.”</p><p>“With your girlfriend.”</p><p>“Yes. With my girlfriend.”</p><p>-</p><p><b>Billy</b>: i know something u don’t know<br /><b>Jen</b>: billy did u miss the memo we ALL know they hooked up<br /><b>Billy</b>: yeah but did you know rio is officially agatha’s GIRLFRIEND<br /><b>Billy</b>: they’re having lunch with nicky in an hour and she’s gonna tell him<br /><b>Alice</b>: oh my god<br /><b>Alice</b>: …that’s actually really cute<br /><b>Jen</b>: holy shit, rio locked down AGATHA for real?<br /><b>Jen</b>: she must be magic<br /><b>Lilia</b>: I believe the kids like to say “I told you so”<br /><b>Billy</b>: lilia did u<br /><b>Billy</b>: did u leak this to the press<br /><b>Billy</b>: “trusted sources” say agatha harkness is off the market<br /><b>Billy</b>: WHO’S TRUSTED SOURCES, LILIA<br /><b>Lilia</b>: i believe the kids also say “no take backsies”<br /><b>Alice</b>: wtf<br /><b>Jen</b>: you’re a legend</p><p>–</p><p>“So how long do I have before I get paparazzi at work?” Rio asks as Agatha fits a ballcap onto her head, pulling it low on Rio’s brow. Oversized sunglasses go on next, transforming Rio into a more generic, anonymous version of herself.</p><p>“In my estimation? They’ll be there by tomorrow.” Agatha frowns a little, adjusting Rio’s flannel shirt for her, pulling it tighter over her shoulders. “I’m sorry about all this.”</p><p>“Don’t be. It’s not like I lived life outside the public eye.” Rio shrugs a shoulder and reaches for Agatha’s hand, stopping her anxious movements. “I mean, obviously the ballet world is smaller than Hollywood, but I don’t care. Seriously. I want you. A couple photographers aren’t going to scare me off.”</p><p>“They’re insufferable sometimes.” Agatha presses her forehead to Rio’s. “I never wanted to drag anyone into that. The fact that Nicky’s had to deal with it even a little is horrible. I’m private in nature. I knew with the career I chose they'd want in on my personal life, but I guess I never knew how much."</p><p>“You’re a charming woman, Agatha Harkness, of course they want to know you.” Rio gives her a quick peck on the lips. “Seriously. Don’t worry. It could be kinda fun. Ooh, I could find creative ways to antagonize them and ruin their photos!”</p><p>“You little devil.” Agatha’s tone of voice is fond beyond measure.</p><p>“You know it’s definitely one of our friends who tipped them off about us, right?”</p><p>“Oh, I know exactly who it was.” Agatha rolls her eyes. All told, the paparazzi shouldn’t know yet that Rio and Agatha are anything serious, and they definitely shouldn’t be parked outside Agatha’s favorite bakery right now lying in wait for them. The paparazzi have certainly caught her there before since she’s a regular, but this is too much of a coincidence. Luckily Agatha always keeps sunglasses and hats in her bag just in case. “And while I get the push, I think I would have preferred making us public in a less…tabloid centric way.”</p><p>“Well, we could just own it?” Rio says, fiddling with the sunglasses. “I mean. We don’t need to give them answers or anything, but why hide behind these?”</p><p>“I suppose I was hoping for … a more elegant outing?”</p><p>“Something posed?” Rio presses, arching an eyebrow. “Agatha, I know your brand. But this is a new venture for the both of us, and things are gonna change for you. I’m not going to go talking to the press at any given chance, but I’m also not going to be your dirty secret.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t ask that of you.”</p><p>“I know, I just want to be clear.” Rio steps closer. “And I’ll respect your wishes. But I’m down to rip the bandaid off right here and now if you are.”</p><p>Agatha pauses, clearly thoughtful, her mind considering a thousand scenarios at once as it is wont to do. Rio can see the moment a decision is made, and she reaches up to take Agatha’s sunglasses off.</p><p>“There you are, beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha groans. “I still have bedhead.”</p><p>“Even better.” Rio tosses her own borrowed sunglasses into her bag along with Agatha’s. “Don’t think of this as something they’re taking from us. Think of it as something we’re celebrating in front of the world. You know what seeing a couple like us would have meant to me as a kid. We could be that for someone out there.”</p><p>“Why Rio Vidal, you are ever so much sweeter than you let on.” Agatha tips the baseball cap off Rio’s head and runs a hand through her dark hair, shaking it out. She leans down, capturing Rio’s lips with her own.</p><p>“Sure, sure. Come on, Agatha Harkness, a brave new world awaits.” Rio grabs her girlfriend’s hand, leading them out onto the street, smiling at her just as a wave of flashbulbs go off.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Jen</b>: actually you know what, they’re gross<br /><b>Jen</b>: this isn’t fun anymore when they’re being all…cute<br /><b>Billy</b>: jen<br /><b>Billy</b>: don’t lie<br /><b>Jen</b>: …<br /><b>Billy</b>: it’s so sweet and u know it<br /><b>Jen</b>: super gross<br /><b>Alice</b>: actually, i’m on board now<br /><b>Alice</b>: i’ve never seen either of them that…smiley<br /><b>Billy</b>: i know!!

  <i>One year later</i>
</p><p>“Rio, are you sure you want to grow all of the flowers yourself?”</p><p>“I don’t trust anyone else with this. At least for our bouquets, Agatha. Oh, and Nicky’s basket.”</p><p>“Well, I know he won’t accept anyone else’s flowers, you’ve turned him just as picky as you are about plants.”</p><p>“He has taste, Agatha. I can’t help it that when I moved in, you had a dead spider plant you’d been ignoring for 3 months and it <i>traumatized</i> the poor boy.”</p><p>“Rio, we’ve been over this.”</p><p>“I almost broke up with you then and there.”</p><p>“Please, we both know you were addicted to me by then. A little plant murder would never have stopped you. In fact, I think you liked my dangerous side.”</p><p>“Then, now, and from the moment we met, baby.”</p><p>Agatha laughs, settling back onto the lawn chair she’s taken to setting up outside in their (rapidly expanding) garden. She doesn’t do a stitch of the lawn work, but she certainly likes to watch her fiance tend to the various flowers, fruits and vegetables Rio grows. Nicky often helps, and even has his own patch of vegetables that neither Rio nor Agatha is allowed to meddle with. After all, seven and a half is <i>such</i> a big age, and he doesn’t need their help. Mostly.</p><p>“The flowers are going to be perfect, I promise.” Rio reassures her, bent over a patch of azaleas with dirt streaks up to her elbows. Agatha tilts her head, casually admiring the view.</p><p>“I have no doubt about that my dear, I just don’t want you to stress yourself out over this wedding.”</p><p>“Because you’re so very relaxed? How many times have you called the wedding planner this week?”</p><p>“She picked up an <i>eggplant</i> table runner instead of lavender last week. Clearly she needs closer supervision.” Agatha sighs, waving a hand in the air dismissively. “Anyway, I’ve only called her four times.”</p><p>“And how many times did you make Billy call her?”</p><p>“...that is irrelevant.”</p><p>Rio cackles, finally straightening up from the flower bed and brushing the dirt from her pants. With a grin a mile wide, she makes her way over to Agatha and settles quite happily in the older woman’s lap. As she leans forward, the chain around her neck swings, causing the moss agate and obsidian ring kept safely on it to bump Agatha’s chest.</p><p>Agatha’s own ring sits prominently on her finger, purple stone glinting in the sunlight, safe from any threat of physical labor and soil.</p><p>“You’re so devastating like this, my love.” She says, reaching a hand up into the wild mess that is Rio’s mane of hair. She plucks out a leaf, twirling it between her fingers.</p><p>“Mm, I knew you liked me untamed and filthy.”</p><p>“It’s one of my favorite yous.”</p><p>Rio leans down to kiss her, the kiss unhurried and familiar, at once routine and novel as if it were their first and not their thousandth. Each time their lips meet Agatha’s heart pounds a little harder, and she feels a little lighter. She’s grateful every time.</p><p>“Mama! Rio! ” The back door flies open, and Rio’s laughing as Nicky comes at them full speed, dive bombing their chair and somehow making it into a cuddle pile. The lawn chair creaks under their combined weight, but Agatha doesn’t care. She just wraps her arms around them both.</p><p>“How was school today, little witch?” Rio asks, ruffling Nicky’s hair before sliding off Agatha’s lap to stand. He pouts a little, but Agatha has to admit that they may have either broken the chair or thrown out her back if they’d stayed piled up too much longer.</p><p>“Brilliant, I got to pick out the book at story time today.” Nicky beams. “And we’re doing a show and tell tomorrow! Can I bring in your dagger?”</p><p>Agatha sputters out a laugh. “Rio’s <i>ornamental dagger</i> that we specifically keep in a locked case so little seven year old hands don’t go playing with it?”</p><p>“Well, I am seven and a half now.”</p><p>“Still not old enough to touch daggers, I’m afraid.” Agatha touches her finger to Nicholas’s nose. “We’ll find something else for you to bring to school, my dove. Maybe one of your favorite toys from Aunt Lilia?”</p><p>Nicky sighs, but snuggles up to Agatha. “Okay. But I wanted to tell them about Rio.”</p><p>“You wanted to tell them about me, little witch?” Rio tilts her head, surprise evident on her features.</p><p>“Yeah, ‘cuz they know all about mama, but in a couple months you’re gonna be my mom too.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skips a beat. She’s afraid her eyes might be watering a little - Rio’s certainly are. They’ve never pressured Nicky to consider Rio anything but Agatha’s partner, even after Rio moved in and Agatha proposed to her. Rio’s been a big presence in her son’s life, absolutely, and there’s no doubt Nicky loves her and enjoys her company. But neither Agatha nor Rio had wanted to make the choice for him to consider Rio a parent.</p><p>It seems Nicky has opened his heart to it all on his own.</p><p>Agatha’s not sure she’s ever been this happy.</p><p>“I can’t call you mama, though, because that will get confusing,” Nicky goes on, oblivious to the adults having their big feelings around him. “Maybe I could call you mother, or madre, like in Spanish…”</p><p>“That would be great, little witch.” Rio sounds a little choked up. When she meets Agatha’s eyes, she smiles, and Agatha’s soul settles. It’s like a final puzzle piece being dropped right into place.</p><p>Her family.</p><p>“Come on, Nicky. We have to get you and your madre both bathed before our guests come over.” Agatha takes her son’s hand, moving towards the house. “Especially Rio, look at the mess she’s made of herself.”</p><p>“Oh yeah?” Rio grins, full of mischief. “I think you need a shower too.”</p><p>Agatha arches a brow. “Don’t you dare.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes light up, and she flashes a grin at Nicky before she’s on Agatha, happily smearing dirt across the older woman’s face. Nicky laughs happily, which is one of the only reasons Agatha lets it happen.</p><p>That, and she’s ridiculously in love.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s heard it’s normal to be nervous before your wedding, but she’s not. Despite never imagining herself as the marriage type, she’s certain that what she’s doing is exactly what’s right for her, and she’s as relaxed as can be.</p><p>She’s lounging in her little getting ready suite, dressed in Agatha’s purple robe with her feet kicked up on the table. Alice, her maid of honor, is sitting in the makeup chair getting her makeup done.</p><p>Her phone pings - it’s Agatha, a close up selfie full of long lashes and clear blue eyes. Rio grins and sends back as unhinged a selfie as she can manage.</p><p><b>Agatha</b>: Will I ever get to wear my robe again?<br />
<b>Rio</b>: no it’s mine now<br />
<b>Rio</b>: just like you xoxoxoxo<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: getting a bit ahead of yourself, aren’t you?<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: we haven’t said our vows yet<br />
<b>Rio</b>: GASP is my future wife already threatening to leave me? my heart<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: Never, baby.<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: It would break nicky’s heart<br />
<b>Rio</b>: staying together for the children, i see<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: Children? Plural?<br />
<b>Rio</b>: …probably not the time for this conversation<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: maybe not. But we’ll talk.<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: I love you, Rio.<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: I can’t wait to marry you.<br />
<b>Rio</b>: we could move the ceremony up a couple hours<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: Don’t be absurd.<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: You know how much we spent on this .<br />
<b>Rio</b>: that, and nicky is very excited to scatter those flowers down the aisle<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: He’s adorable.<br />
<b>Rio</b>: little troublemaker.<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: Our little troublemaker.<br />
<b>Rio</b>: yeah &lt;3<br />
<b>Rio</b>: I love you too.<br />
<b>Rio</b>: see you sooooon.<br />
<b>Agatha</b>: What, not even a peak under the robe?<br />
<b>Rio</b>: hahahahaha<br />
<b>Rio</b>: give me two minutes</p><p>-</p><p>Wanda and Jennifer look lovely in their purple bridesmaid dresses, though Agatha admits it's still a little strange to see Jennifer standing up beside her at her wedding. She’d half thought Jen would laugh her off when she asked her to be a bridesmaid.</p><p>Alice is dressed in green waiting on Rio’s side, Billy beside her in an adorable suit. Despite being terrified of Rio for half their relationship, the two have grown weirdly close.</p><p>Lilia stands at the head of the room, looking as self-satisfied as possible as she prepares to officiate the wedding she’d accurately predicted over a year ago. Nicky’s already made his way up the aisle through all of the guests, happily scattering the flowers Rio grew lovingly. He stands, bouncing on tiptoes, at Jen’s side.</p><p>Agatha only has eyes for the doorway.</p><p>Rio and Agatha have shared everything in the year they’ve lived together, no secrets except this: Rio Vidal’s wedding dress. Rio’s seen Agatha’s, hanging in their office as Jennifer made alterations to it, but Rio’s been oddly traditional about keeping hers a closely guarded secret.</p><p>Billy’s been teasing Agatha about it for months.</p><p>Agatha clutches her bouquet a little tighter as Rio’s entrance music begins to play, finding herself a little breathless.</p><p>Rio rounds the corner, and Agatha’s heart picks up a now-familiar, cheerful beat. Her soon-to-be wife is as stunning as ever. The dress she chose is fitted close to her body with a characteristically daring plunging neckline. Rio topped the look off with a dramatic sheer black veil, crafting an aura all her own while still looking every inch the bride.</p><p>Agatha’s bride.</p><p>It feels like an eternity waiting for Rio to reach her at the altar, and when she does Agatha reels her in and plants a kiss on her lips, heedless of the traditional “kiss your bride” moment. She refuses to wait when Rio looks like that. The younger woman is laughing as they part, her hand caressing Agatha’s cheek fondly.</p><p>“My impatient baby.”</p><p>“You’re to blame, my love.”</p><p>“Naturally.”</p><p>Lilia clears her throat primly, and both the women finally turn to look at her, ready for the ceremony. They’ve been ready for a long time, though to some their relationship may seem accelerated. The press and tabloids have speculated about them since the day they went public, trying to poke holes in their bond and spread gossip, but Agatha and Rio are private and their relationship has remained strong. They fit together perfectly, and neither of them have seen any reason to hesitate when it’s so clear what they both want.</p><p>They’re family, and it’s time to make it official.</p><p>Lilia opens her little binder, getting ready to start the ceremony. Agatha meets Rio’s eyes and grins wholeheartedly, as Lilia speaks:</p><p>“Just to begin, I have to say this: I. Told. You. So.”</p><p> </p><p>
