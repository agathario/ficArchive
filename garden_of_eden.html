<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha had no idea what to get Jen for her birthday. Cosmetics were out of the question—her friend had her own brand, and giving her a lipstick or a highlighter felt like bringing sand to the beach. Clothes were another dead end. Jen had an annoyingly specific sense of style—part vintage, part avant-garde, part "I found this in a secret store hidden behind a coffee shop"—and Agatha had long accepted she’d never crack that particular code. She’d run through every other idea she could think of: jewelry (too personal), books (too impersonal), wine (too predictable), until everything felt like something Jen would either hate or, worse, pretend to like.</p><p> </p><p>So, naturally, Agatha found herself scrambling for a last-minute miracle on the actual day of the party.</p><p> </p><p>She’d already burned through a list of nearby boutiques and “hidden gem” gift shops she had looked it up online, each more disappointing than the last. Two hours later, she was ready to throw in the towel and accept her fate as The Friend Who Brought a Bad Gift. She’d started mentally drafting the self-deprecating apology she’d deliver when she handed it over.</p><p> </p><p>But then she saw it.</p><p> </p><p>A storefront she must have passed a dozen times before without really noticing. The sign above the door read "O Jardim" in delicate, looping script, framed by strands of trailing ivy and tiny white blossoms. The name tugged at something in her memory, vaguely familiar, but she couldn’t quite place it.</p><p> </p><p>She stood on the sidewalk for a moment, staring at the shop like it might offer her a way out of the disaster this day had become.</p><p> </p><p>Jen likes plants, she reasoned. Or at least she doesn’t kill them immediately, which is more than I can say for herself. And honestly, She got nothing else.</p><p> </p><p>With a sigh that turned into a determined breath, Agatha pushes the door open and steps inside.</p><p> </p><p>A bell chimes over her head. The air was cool and smelled like soil and lavender, with faint undertones of what Agatha thought might be eucalyptus. Inside, the chaos of the city dropped away. </p><p> </p><p>The shop was a jungle in miniature—lush greenery spilling off shelves, terracotta pots in every size, soft music playing somewhere in the back. A sleepy gray cat blinked at her from a patch of sunlight near the window, then promptly went back to napping.</p><p> </p><p>“I will be right there,” a voice comes muffled from somewhere in the back.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a few hesitant steps in, immediately overwhelmed by the sheer greenness of it all. Plants with impossible names—calatheas, monsteras, hoyas—lined the walls. Some had patterned leaves that looked painted by hand, others bloomed with tiny, vivid flowers like fireworks captured mid-burst.</p><p> </p><p>A young woman in overalls and a pin that read “O Jardim” stepped out from behind a curtain of hanging pothos, brushing her hands on her apron, fingers smudged with soil. </p><p> </p><p>“Looking for anything in particular?” she asks, the kind of easy, friendly tone that made it clear she wasn’t in a rush.</p><p> </p><p>When she looks up, Agatha’s whole body stills.</p><p> </p><p>Those eyes—soft, brown, too familiar. Agatha had stared at them before, though only ever through her phone. She knew that face. Not well, not really, but enough to recognize it immediately. </p><p> </p><p>She’d first seen Rio in Alice’s stories, sometimes tagged in old group photos or blurry birthday posts. They’d never met, not properly, but Agatha had been curious enough to tap through Rio’s profile more times than she’d admit.</p><p> </p><p>Not that there was much to stalk. Rio kept a low profile. Her feed was mostly mood: the corner of a book, a cup of coffee, the grey cat that Agatha now knows it must be hers. Just enough to be intriguing. Just enough to keep Agatha coming back. Still, she hadn’t made the connection when she saw the shop.</p><p> </p><p>The name “O Jardim” had felt familiar, but it hadn’t clicked. Probably because the store didn’t even have a social media presence. Alice had mentioned it offhand once, said Rio was too stubborn to make an account for it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had googled it out of curiosity back then, found one lonely Yelp review and no photos. She hadn’t even known where it was.</p><p>And yet—here it was. And here was Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” Rio says, her mouth parting slightly, her voice surprised but not unfriendly. “Agatha, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods like her heart wasn’t doing something deeply embarrassing. “Yeah. You’re Alice’s friend, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. Rio.” She offers her hand instinctively, then glances down and winces. “Oops—dirt. Sorry. I was replanting something dramatic.”</p><p> </p><p>“That… makes sense,” Agatha says, trying to play it cool, like this wasn’t completely surreal.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilts her head, smiling a little. “It’s funny, we’ve never actually met, right? But I feel like I’ve seen you around.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha almost laughs. Yeah, from your best friend’s story highlights and that one tagged brunch pic you looked like you didn’t want to be in. “Same,” she says instead. “I guess we’ve been on parallel party circuits.”</p><p> </p><p>“Guess so,” Rio replies, eyes warm with that soft, curious kind of friendliness that made Agatha’s stomach do something inconvenient.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a breath, reminding herself why she was here. “I need a gift. Last-minute. Very picky birthday girl. I’ve rejected several overpriced boutiques and at least one aggressively scented candle stall, so far”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah,” Rio says with mock gravity, “the classic birthday emergency.”</p><p> </p><p>“The worst kind.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” she says, gesturing deeper into the shop, “let’s see if we can save the day.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha follows her through the greenery, the air filled with the scent of soil and something sweet and green. As Rio ducks beneath a hanging fern and motions toward a shelf of planters, Agatha couldn’t help but think this was already the most successful part of her day, and maybe not just because of the plants.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lets Agatha wander, staying just close enough to answer questions when they come up. Not that Agatha had that many questions, she just liked how Rio’s voice dipped when she explained things. And sure, she might be dragging this out longer than necessary, but Rio didn’t seem to mind. In fact, Agatha caught her smiling more than once for no reason at all.</p><p> </p><p>She rounds a corner and pauses in front of a shelf with tiny, fierce-looking plants nestled in moss. A sign next to them catches her eye, and she bursts out laughing.</p><p> </p><p>“Please don’t tease the flytraps!” it read. “How would you like it if someone stuck their finger down YOUR throat?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio appears at her side a moment later, following her gaze. “Yeah,” she says, sheepish. “That was Alice’s idea.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leans in, grinning. “I don’t know,” she says casually. “I think I’d actually love that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chokes. “W-what?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns to her, fully enjoying the way Rio’s ears flushed pink. “Just saying,” she adds, with a shrug that was anything but innocent.</p><p> </p><p>Then she squints at the bottom of the sign, reading aloud the tiny footnote: “Besides... they lose energy when made to close without food.”</p><p> </p><p>“Damn,” she says. “These little things can’t take anything, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinks like she’d just been hit with a sunlamp. “Well—they, um—it’s a survival mechanism,” she mumbles. “Energy conservation. Not like… I mean, not everyone… not everything is into that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you?” She asks, purposely batting her lashes.</p><p> </p><p>“Am I what?” Rio asks confused.</p><p> </p><p>“Into that”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chokes again, hiding it as a cough that turns into a real cough. Agatha is almost worried that she went too far, but then she seems to recover, because she says. “I mean, I'm definitely not opposed to that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles, slow and self-satisfied. “good to know” and as a final blow, she winks at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>A new confidence had settled into her, like someone had flipped a switch. Every time she made a suggestive remark, she watched Rio’s pupils dilate like clockwork. It was honestly kind of addictive.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, she picks out a lovely pink maranta in a hand-painted pot that looks just eccentric enough to suit Jen. As Rio rings her up, Agatha leans against the counter, pretending to look at the shop’s decor.</p><p> </p><p>When the receipt prints and Rio passes it over, Agatha picks a pen on the counter and writes her number at the back of it before sliding it back to Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“In case you ever want to test that theory,” she says, voice smooth like honey and twice as sticky. “Or just, you know… talk plants.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stares at the paper for half a second too long before grabbing one of her cards, and writing what Agatha assumes is her personal number down in careful, neat script. </p><p> </p><p>“Thanks for the help,” Agatha adds, lifting the bag and holding Rio’s gaze. “Seriously. I’ll let you know how the birthday goes.”</p><p> </p><p>“I—I hope she likes it,” Rio manages, smiling, dazed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns on her heel and leaves the shop, the bell jingling behind her.</p><p> </p><p>Outside, she grins to herself. Mission accomplished. </p><p> </p><p>And maybe not the one she’d come in for.</p><p> </p><p align="center">🍃🪴🍃</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha walked out of Jardim earlier that afternoon, Rio hadn't expected to see her again anytime soon. She certainly hadn’t expected to run into her again later that same day. But fate, it seemed, had other plans—and a wicked sense of humor.</p><p> </p><p>Alice had called her around six, dramatically distressed over what to wear to her crush’s party and eventually convincing Rio to go with her. Which, as it turned out, was not just any party.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s her birthday,” Rio groans, sprawled across her bed, holding her phone to her ear. “You said party, not birthday. Now I’m going to show up uninvited and giftless. Great.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s fine!” Alice says, voice slightly muffled, probably holding the phone with her shoulder while applying way too much eyeliner. “She told me I could bring whoever I wanted.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs. “Yeah, but she probably didn’t mean it like that.”</p><p> </p><p>“She did,” Alice insists, completely unfazed. “Come on, I’ll buy you a drink.”</p><p> </p><p>That wasn’t much of an incentive. Rio didn’t even like crowded bars, but Alice had perfected the art of coaxing her into situations she didn't particularly want to be in. So, Rio caved. She pulled on a decent outfit, fluffed her curls, and threw on her usual coat of barely-there makeup.</p><p> </p><p>Feeling like she’d regret it the minute they got there.</p><p> </p><p>The bar was packed, wall-to-wall with bodies and overlapping conversations. Music pulsed through the floor. Rio sticks close behind Alice as they wave through the crowd, slipping past swaying bodies and overly enthusiastic dancers, until they reach a corner table where a group had gathered around a woman with a tiny paper crown on.</p><p> </p><p>“Happy birthday, Jen” Alice says, practically bouncing with excitement. “Jen, this is my best friend, Rio,”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook the birthday girl’s hand with a quick, polite smile.</p><p> </p><p>“It's so nice to finally meet you, Ali talks about you all the time,”</p><p> </p><p>“All lies I assume, unless it's good, then it's true,” she jokes, making the other woman laugh. “Happy birthday, by the way,”</p><p> </p><p>She was already prepared to fade into the background of the celebration. But then, like something out of a movie, her gaze shifts slightly, and lands directly on her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Perched beside Jen, looking almost unfairly beautiful, her long brunette hair tucked behind one ear, her blue eyes catching the low bar light like gemstones.</p><p> </p><p>Rio freezes, momentarily forgetting how to form words. The surprise must’ve show on her face because Agatha’s lips curls into an amused smile.</p><p> </p><p>“You should’ve told me you were coming,” she teases, taking a slow sip from her glass.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinks, pulling herself together. “I didn’t know I was until about an hour ago,” she says, trying to sound casual but failing. “And I definitely didn’t know it was your friend’s birthday.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha arches her brow. “Small world.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ridiculously small,” Rio mutters, cheeks warming.</p><p> </p><p>Alice had already been absorbed into another conversation at the other end of the table, exactly as Rio predicted. Which left her, again, alone with Agatha. Or as alone you could be in a crowded bar.</p><p> </p><p>She should have felt awkward. She really should have. But when Agatha scoots slightly, gesturing for Rio to move, she does and Agatha stands next to her, a vision in that impossibly delicate black lace top being held together by a simple bow and wide-legged pants that swish with confidence.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, cutie, I’ll buy you a drink,” she says, already grabbing Rio’s hand and pulling her away from the group without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio lets her. Agatha walks like she owns every room and she enjoys the pull, the ease with which Agatha cuts through the crowd, commanding the kind of attention people don’t even realize they’re giving.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want?” Agatha asks, glancing over her shoulder with a playful smile that makes Rio’s stomach flip.</p><p> </p><p>“Just a beer is fine,” Rio says, voice low.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods and turns, waving at the bartender, who comes over immediately, which feels ridiculous considering he’s been clearly ignoring most of the people at the bar.</p><p> </p><p>When one of the stools next to them frees up, Agatha pushes Rio to sit and slides in between her legs, close enough that Rio’s breath catches. She hands over the beer and takes a sip of her own drink, looking entirely too pleased with herself.</p><p> </p><p>Rio watches her, the way her collarbone catches the light, the contrast of black lace against skin, and she doesn’t even bother pretending she’s not staring.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha catches her, smirking. “Liking what you see?” she teases, one eyebrow arched, confident in the way only someone who knows they’re being admired can be.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t look away. Holding her gaze, defiantly, “You’re not exactly making it easy not to.”</p><p> </p><p>They stay like that for a moment, gazing into each other's eyes, daring the other to look away and Rio was ready to keep this up, until she sees her eyes darting to Agatha’s lips as she licks away a drop of the drink she was sipping.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head, as if the act is going to clear her mind. “Do you think I should apologize?” </p><p> </p><p>“About what?” Agatha asks, genuinely confused.</p><p> </p><p>“To Jen,” Rio explains, but Agatha is still looking at her with her brows raised. “For crashing at her party and not even bringing a gift,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her for a moment before letting out the most delighted laugh Rio had ever heard.</p><p> </p><p>“Please, Jen is probably basking at the idea of all these people here for her.” Agatha starts. “And you saw my crisis, there was no way you could have bought her something she would like,”</p><p> </p><p>It's Rio time to raise her brows, after all she did help Agatha get her gift just a few hours ago. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh you know what I mean,” Agatha says, rolling her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks at her, having fun with the way Agatha seems caught in her trap. </p><p> </p><p>“How about this,” Agatha says with a sultry voice, slender fingers tracing the collar of Rio’s leather jacket, before using it to pull Rio even closer. Her breath warm next to Rio’s ear. “Depending on how this night goes, I can tell her the plant was from both of us,”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s own breath hitches as Agatha pulls back a bit, staring at Rio for a bit longer, breath ghosting her lips, then before she retreats all the way and takes another sip of her drink. Like she hadn't just given Rio an imaginary boner.</p><p> </p><p>“You're awfully flirty, huh?” Rio says, trying to regain some of her dignity.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, you did say you wouldn't be opposed to sticking your fingers down my throat,” Agatha teases and Rio almost chokes on her beer.</p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly, they engage in a normal conversation after that, flirting here and there, but overall just getting to know each other. Rio gets them to their next round and the only thing that breaks their bubble is when they see the commotion on their previous table and they realize they've been gone long enough that they almost missed the cake.</p><p> </p><p>They sneak back, neither of their friends really noticing they were gone or the way they've been awfully close now that they are back. Agatha practically sits on her lap when they slide into the booth again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pretends it’s completely normal for Agatha to be feeding her cake, like it’s a totally regular thing to accept dessert off someone else’s fork while the person stares directly into your soul. She stays cool, even when Agatha uses the pad of her thumb to wipe a smudge of frosting from the corner of her mouth and then — very deliberately — licks it clean.</p><p> </p><p>The tension between them is making Rio go insane. She wishes she could talk to Alice, but her best friend seems to be in a worse case of lesbian panic than her.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm going to the bathroom,” Agatha says with a wink, her voice laced with intention.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha leaves, Rio feels herself releasing a breath she didn't know she was holding, as she watches her disappear through the crowd. And of course that was the moment that Alice finally met her eyes from across the table. The look in her eyes was full of teasing and curiosity. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was about to text Alice to meet her at the bar to debrief what the fuck is happening, when a notification popped up on her phone.</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>Agatha</strong>
</p><p>are you coming, big boy?</p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck</em>.</p><p> </p><p>She barely registers Alice’s knowing smirk across the table before she’s on her feet, slipping past bodies and heading toward the bathroom with tunnel vision. No line. No interruptions. Just a door she pushes open with a heartbeat loud in her ears.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s leaning against the sink, arms crossed, her expression all smug anticipation.</p><p>“Took you long enough,” she says.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t answer. She steps forward and cages Agatha in, one hand braced on either side of the sink. They’re close enough to breathe the same air.</p><p> </p><p>“You like to play dangerous games, huh?” Rio murmurs, but it sounds more like a dare than a warning.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles, lazy and inviting. “I do, you should probably do something about it.”</p><p> </p><p>That’s all it takes. Rio surges forward, her hands pulling Agatha close, catching her lips in a kiss that’s all heat and urgency, years of self-control unraveling in a single, reckless moment. Agatha lets out a tiny gasp before she kisses her back just as fiercely, fingers tangling in Rio’s jacket, pulling her closer, deeper, like they’re both starved and finally allowed to eat.</p><p> </p><p>Their kisses grow hungrier, more desperate — hands roaming with less hesitation, breath catching between gasps and quiet moans. Agatha’s nails dig into Rio’s shoulders as Rio mouths down her neck, the sound of her name falling from Agatha’s lips in a whisper that nearly undoes her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tugs at the hem of Rio’s shirt, slipping her hands underneath, and Rio mirrors the action, fingers toying with the thin strings that hold Agatha’s blouse together. It would be so easy to undo them, so easy to lose themselves right here.</p><p> </p><p>But then a slightly louder sound from outside jolts a bit of clarity into her.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait,” she breathes, forehead resting against Agatha’s. “We’re still in a public bathroom, Agatha”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets out a shaky laugh, brushing her thumb against Rio’s lower lip. “Yeah, not my most glamorous moment.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grins, and then, more seriously, “My place?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilts her head, eyes dark and curious, lips already kiss-bruised. “Yeah,” she says. “Let’s go.”</p><p> </p><p>They part reluctantly. Agatha smooths her hair in the mirror while Rio adjusts her jacket and quietly slips out of the bathroom. Her heart is racing as she weaves through the crowd, adrenaline and disbelief mixing in her veins. </p><p> </p><p>She ducks out the side door, the cool night air hitting her flushed face. She leans against the brick wall, trying to catch her breath, phone clutched tightly in one hand, as she calls for an Uber.</p><p> </p><p><em>What the hell just happened?</em> she thinks, staring up at the sky like it might offer answers.</p><p> </p><p>And then the door opens, and Agatha steps out — calm, collected, and devastatingly beautiful, coat over one arm, bag slung over her shoulder, and that same spark in her eyes that had pulled Rio in from this mess from the very start.</p><p> </p><p>She walks right up to Rio, and for a moment, neither of them say anything. Just a slow, breathless smile. Then Agatha’s slender fingers hook around the carabiner on Rio’s jeans, and pull her closer, giving her a kiss that it's surprisingly tame for the way they were making out before.</p><p> </p><p>The Uber pulls up just as Agatha’s lips leave the corner of Rio’s mouth, and Rio feels herself short-circuit a little.</p><p> </p><p>“Perfect timing,” she says, trying to sound composed — like her heart isn’t sprinting in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just smirks, clearly not buying it. “You planned this suspiciously well,” she teases, sliding into the car with Rio right behind her.</p><p> </p><p>The ride is short, but it feels impossibly long. Agatha doesn’t make it easier, her hand brushes against Rio’s thigh more times than can be considered accidental, and every time Rio glances at her, Agatha is already looking back, eyes dark with something unreadable and teasing.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you okay there?” Agatha asks, leaning closer, voice a little smug.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. Just trying to survive this ride,” Rio replies, jaw tight, trying her best not to combust.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums, clearly enjoying the power she holds in the moment. She doesn’t press, just lets her hand rest lightly on Rio’s knee through the ripped jeans, thumb making Rio’s skin feel like it’s burning as she moves in slow, infuriating circles until they finally pull up in front of Rio’s building.</p><p> </p><p>They step out, and the cool air offers some momentary relief. But as soon as they’re inside and waiting for the elevator, the tension snaps.</p><p> </p><p>As soon as they enter it, Rio pulls Agatha toward her, backing her against the elevator wall the moment the doors close. Her mouth finds Agatha’s in a rough, urgent kiss, the kind that makes Agatha sigh into it, hands gripping Rio’s jacket tightly.</p><p> </p><p>“I couldn’t wait anymore,” Rio breathes against her lips, voice low and hoarse.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank god,” Agatha whispers back, already pulling Rio closer by her carabiner again. “I was starting to think you’d changed your mind”</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffs a laugh, lips pressed to Agatha’s jaw, her neck, sternum wherever she can reach. “Never.”</p><p> </p><p>The elevator dings at her floor, and they don’t even bother pulling apart, just stumble out, still half tangled in each other, as Rio leads them down the hall to her apartment.</p><p> </p><p align="center">🍃🪴🍃</p><p> </p><p>There is not a single second after they step inside Rio's apartment that Rio isn’t on Agatha. Her hands finding purchase on her waist, slipping beneath her jacket, pushing it off her shoulders as her mouth drags heat along the line of Agatha’s neck. The door barely clicks shut before Agatha is pressed up against it, gasping as Rio’s lips find that spot just under her jaw that makes her knees weak.</p><p> </p><p>They don’t speak, they don’t need to. There’s only the sound of rushed breaths, the rustle of clothing, the quiet thud of shoes being kicked off as they fumble their way through the narrow hallway, lips never parting for more than a second. Rio walks her backward, step by step, until they’re half-tripping over the rug, too caught up in the pull of each other to care.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers are tangled in Rio’s hair, her other hand sliding up beneath the back of Rio’s shirt like she’s desperate to memorize the curve of her spine, the warmth of her skin. Every touch is searing, addictive, a silent plea not to stop. And Rio doesn’t, she doesn’t stop kissing her, touching her, gripping at her hips like she might disappear if she lets go.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels delirious from the sheer absurdity of it all, her heart hammering, mind barely able to catch up. When she started her day, she hadn’t expected this. She definitely hadn’t expected to be led to her crush’s bedroom, lips bruised from kissing, blouse half undone, and thighs aching with anticipation. Can it even be called a crush anymore? It had started as a dumb little thing, an infatuation she never thought would mean anything. But now?</p><p> </p><p>Now, Rio’s kissing her like she means it. Like she’s been waiting to do this for weeks. And Agatha? Agatha wants to take and take and take as much as Rio is willing to give.</p><p> </p><p>They crash into the bed, Rio’s hands already undoing the string of Agatha’s blouse, the fabric falls on both sides of Agatha’s torso, leaving her chest bare and Rio looking at her like she’s something sacred. </p><p> </p><p>For the first time that night, Agatha feels shy under Rio’s admiring eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, do you have any idea how hot you are?” Rio asks.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha wants to say something, teasing her to feel less embarrassed, but everything she could think of dies on her throat when Rio lowers herself and sucks at her nipple.</p><p> </p><p>The moan that comes out of her mouth is louder than she was expecting and she feels Rio smirking on her skin. She licks at Agatha’s nipple, before doing the same thing on the other side and trailing her kisses back up, purposely sucking at the junction of Agatha's shoulder and neck, making Agatha squirm.</p><p> </p><p>She kisses Agatha again, her hands roaming as she straddles Agatha. Agatha gets impatient, pulling at her shirt to take it off and Rio complies, pulling back a bit and taking her t-shirt off.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stops for a moment, probably catching Agatha's eyes openly raking over her body — and she doesn’t seem to mind. Agatha is pretty sure her brain is short-circuiting. It’s not just the lean lines of Rio’s abs that are undoing her, though that alone would be criminal. It’s the tattoos. The bold moon inked beneath her sternum, framed by olive branches like she’s carved out of mythology, and the soft, black florals blooming up each of her hips, disappearing beneath the band of her boxers. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingertips twitch with the urge to trace them, to learn every petal and line with her mouth. It’s too much. She wants to commit every inch of Rio to memory.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grins when she notices Agatha staring, cocky and flushed and breathless all at once. “You okay there?” she teases, her voice rough around the edges, still a little shaky with want.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to respond, but nothing coherent comes out. Her fingers twitch against Rio’s hips instead, slipping under the band of her boxers like she can’t decide if she wants to pull her closer or push them off completely. “You—” she starts, then laughs breathlessly, tilting her head back against the pillow. “You should come with a warning.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles lowly, leaning down again, her lips brushing the corner of Agatha’s mouth. “I’ll get it tattooed,” she murmurs, kissing her jaw, her neck, the curve of her shoulder. “Right next to the one you’re about to lose your mind over.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shivers, fingers tightening on Rio’s waist. “You’re really enjoying this, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean,” Rio says, pressing her mouth to the hollow of Agatha’s throat, “from what you've been saying all day, I was expecting I would have to work a little more to get you to shut up,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasps at the words, the honesty in them burning almost more than Rio’s mouth on her skin. Her hands roam, trailing along Rio’s back, her arms, mapping her out like she’s trying to burn every inch into memory. </p><p> </p><p>“Maybe I should make you then,” she breathes, and that earns her a groan from Rio that seems to come from somewhere deep in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>That’s all the warning she gets before Rio is kissing her again, harder, deeper, and it doesn’t feel like a game anymore. It’s messy and hungry and entirely too much, and yet nowhere near enough.</p><p> </p><p>The last bits of fabric covering their body start disappearing without either of them really registering it, lost somewhere in the tangle of limbs and breathless gasps. Rio’s hands are everywhere over Agatha’s body.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t tell who’s making more noise, her or Rio, but it doesn’t matter. There’s a fever to it now, a desperation that makes every kiss rougher, every touch more intense, and when Agatha tilts her hips up, grinding against the firm line of Rio’s thigh, the moan that rips out of her throat is damn near obscene.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio mutters. “You’re driving me insane.”</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers slide lower onto her own body and Agatha's eyes watch transfixed as she gathers her wetness on her fingers and brings them close to Agatha’s face. Her mouth opened instinctively. </p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks at her, tongue sliding to her cheeks playfully as she teases Agatha's lips. Agatha licks her lips, the taste of Rio on her making her moan. She teases the two fingers on her mouth and Agatha is quick to wrap her lips around it immediately, sucking at it, reveling in it.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio pushes the fingers down, Agatha looks at her, her pupils blown as she looks at Agatha with something that looks almost like reverence. Agatha moans around Rio’s fingers as she experimentally fucks her throat with it.</p><p> </p><p>“You really weren't kidding when you said that, huh?” Rio teases. “I bet you would love to gag on my cock, too,” she says almost as an afterthought, but the idea gets Agatha whining, imagining Rio fucking her mouth with her strap.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles, pushing a strand of Agatha's hair away from her face. It's almost soft considering the way she if fucking her fingers down Agatha's throat. </p><p> </p><p>“You want that, baby?” she asks with a sultry voice. “to suck my cock before I fuck you?”</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha is not ashamed to admit how hard she nodded her head, the idea cursing through her body with a warm desire that went straight to her core. When Rio pulls her fingers all the way out, Agatha adds. “Please,”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lets out a dark chuckle, before fucking her fingers in one last time. “Cute,” she says before taking her fingers off completely and kissing Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Somewhere inside Agatha's head, something tells her to be embarrassed, but she couldn't care less about anything other than Rio fumbling around a drawer.</p><p> </p><p>When she turns towards the bed, Agatha can see the ink of her floral tattoo going from her hip all the way to the middle of her thigh and the fucking strap now attached to a harness.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha mouth waters and when she looks up, Rio is smirking at her again. </p><p> </p><p>She gets back to bed, sitting with her back to the headboard, she taps her thighs only one time and Agatha scrambles to position herself on all fours in between her legs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her with pleading eyes and Rio nods. “Go ahead, baby, take what you want.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels the strap on her hand, pumping it a few times before taking the tip in her mouth, hollowing out her cheeks and sucking lightly. Rio takes her hair in her hand and pushes her hips further into Agatha’s mouth, until the majority of it is gone between her lips.</p><p> </p><p>The pad of the strap must bump against her clit and she groans, chasing the sensation by pushing more of the strap down Agatha's throat. Agatha gags, tears welling in her eyes as it hits deeper.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s thrusts get messy every time the pad hits her when she moves her hips. "You’re doing so good, angel. so good." her hips buckle deep again.</p><p> </p><p>Somehow, Rio snakes her hand over Agatha, fingers easily gliding through her wet folds and making her moan around the strap.</p><p> </p><p>“Sucking my cock left you this wet, baby?” She teases, fingers softly circling around Agatha's clit.</p><p> </p><p>All Agatha can do is whine as Rio touches her without loosing the momento fucking her throat. When she slides one finger into Agatha, she pulls her up by the hair, bringing her to a hungry kiss as she fucks another finger into her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels herself pushing her hips forwards which only make the pad of Rio’s palm put pressure on her clit and make her moan into the kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles, slowly pulling out her fingers. Agatha lets out a displeased whine, but lets herself be manhandled so her back is on the mattress again.</p><p> </p><p>“Don't be impatient, baby.” Rio says, dragging her lips down the curve of Agatha’s stomach. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can only arch into the touch, fingers threading into Rio’s hair, tugging just enough to make her groan again. She feels drunk on her, dizzy with heat and skin and want.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally slides lower, her hands bracing Agatha’s thighs apart, it takes everything in Agatha not to fall apart right then and there, because the look in Rio’s eyes is molten, reverent, like she wants to worship her.</p><p> </p><p>And then she does.</p><p> </p><p>The feeling of Rio’s lips on her clit is pure ecstasy. Agatha’s eyes flutter shut at the sensation of Rio starting to suck lightly. Moaning, she grabs a fistful of Rio’s hair and grinds up into her face, seeking more. </p><p> </p><p>Rio hums in satisfaction, happy to fulfil her request. She nips gently and begins to tease Agatha’s entrance with her tongue, dipping it in ever so slightly. When she uses her thumb against her clit, Agatha is pretty sure she could cum at the very moment.</p><p> </p><p>She seems to get it too, because she withdraws her head from Agatha's legs, just gently circling her bound of nerves as she looks at Agatha with pure lust on her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Please,” Agatha says, even though she is not really sure what she’s pleading anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s arms snake under her legs, pulling Agatha's hips up and into her. It’s then that Agatha feels the strap poke into her entrance, making her whimper.</p><p> </p><p>“Is this what you want, angel?” She asks, slowly moving the tip of the strap through Agatha's wet folds, making it glisten with Agatha’s juice.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, please, fuck me—” Agatha babbles as Rio smirks at her.</p><p> </p><p>And with that, she slides into her, facing very little resistance with how wet Agatha already was. As she bottoms out, her hips pressing into hers, Agatha can’t help the whimper that escapes her lips.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hears Rio chuckle when she leans into her, capturing her lips in a searing kiss while still continuing her thrusts. </p><p> </p><p>“You look so pretty like this for me,” Rio praises, thrusts never slowing. “I could stay like this the whole night,” she adds a particular hard thrust, making Agatha whine. </p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls the upper part of her body up again, thumb softly caressing Agatha's bitten lips. Agatha gets it right away, promptly open her mouth as Rio fucks her finger into it again.</p><p> </p><p>She gags on it immediately, tears falling down her face as she lets the overwhelming sensation of it all consume her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha comes with a cry and Rio takes her fingers off her mouth in order to kiss her as she tucks Agatha through her high. </p><p> </p><p>She winces a bit when Rio pulls out, her body aching in ways that feel both too much and not enough. But the moment Rio sheds the harness and tosses it carelessly somewhere on the bed before pulling her close, Agatha melts into the embrace.</p><p> </p><p>She tucks herself against Rio’s chest, cheek resting where she can hear her heartbeat still racing beneath damp skin. It’s grounding, Rio’s arms around her, the way she holds her like she means it.</p><p> </p><p>“You okay?” Rio murmurs, lips brushing Agatha’s temple.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, her smile slow and lazy even though her throat feels wrecked. “Yeah,” she says, the word rasping a little.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t miss the flash of concern in Rio’s eyes, or the way her hand starts tracing soft, soothing patterns along her back, fingers ghosting over tender spots with a kind of reverence that makes Agatha’s chest hurt.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m just… a little sore,” she admits, voice quieter now. “But it’s good. I’m good.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lets out a low, almost relieved laugh, burying her face in Agatha’s hair for a second. “I’ll get you some water. Or food. Both?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tightens her grip around her waist. “Don’t go yet.”</p><p> </p><p>The silence that follows is warm, filled with nothing but the sound of their breathing and the afterglow settling over them like a blanket. Agatha lets herself sink into it, into Rio. It’s not just the sex that’s left her undone, it’s everything. The absurdity of it all and the way Rio is holding her like she wants her to stay.</p><p> </p><p>She closes her eyes, letting her fingers lay across Rio’s stomach, feeling the slow rise and fall with every breath.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio whispers eventually, a kiss pressed behind her ear. “I’ll stay.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">🍃🪴🍃</p><p> </p><p>Rio isn't sure when they fell asleep, somewhere between the lazy kisses and sleepy makeouts, she guesses, but she wakes up too early, sunlight spilling through the window in soft, golden streaks. She blinks against it, squinting slightly, annoyed at herself for forgetting to close the curtains.</p><p>The irritation vanishes the moment she realizes Agatha is still in her arms.</p><p> </p><p>Curled against her, breathing slow and even, face relaxed, and Rio lets herself enjoy it, the quiet weight of Agatha’s body against hers, the warmth of it. She hadn’t expected this. Any of this.</p><p> </p><p>She’s still stunned by how quickly everything had shifted, she was never the one to do one-night-stands, and definitely not with acquaintances.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stirs, a sharp inhale cutting through the stillness. She startles awake, eyes wide, as if just realizing where she is. “Shit,” she mumbles, already beginning to sit up. “I—uh, I didn't mean to fall asleep, I’ll get out of your hair soon.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio just smiles, catching her wrist before she can go far and tugging her gently back down, their bodies pressed together again. “You could,” she says, eyes crinkling. “But I’m actually kinda glad you're still here.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her lip, still clearly embarrassed, but she doesn’t pull away.</p><p> </p><p>“And,” Rio adds, pressing a kiss to her temple, “I’d really love it if you stayed for breakfast too.”</p><p> </p><p>That gets a small, reluctant laugh out of her. “You make a habit of feeding your one-night-stands in the morning?”</p><p> </p><p>“Only the ones who moan my name like that,” Rio teases.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans, covering her face, but nods. </p><p>“Okay. But I’m showering first. I feel like I’ve been steamrolled… in a good way.”</p><p> </p><p>While Agatha disappears into the bathroom, Rio grabs a quick shower in the guest bathroom and heads to the kitchen to start breakfast. By the time Agatha returns, she’s in Rio’s sweatpants, cuffed at the ankle, and a worn “O Jardim” tee Rio had left for her.</p><p> </p><p>She looks good. Too good. The kind of good that makes Rio’s chest hurt in a sweet, dangerous way.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leans against the doorway, watching her with a smirk. “You really do know your way around a skillet.”</p><p> </p><p>“Please, this is beginner flirting fuel. Wait ‘til I make you pancakes shaped like animals.”</p><p> </p><p>“Careful there,” she says, settling at the counter. “I might fall in love just for that.”</p><p> </p><p>Breakfast is warm and easy. There’s a lot of banter, Agatha calling Rio out for how cocky she really is, Rio trying to call her out for all the teasing the day before. There’s foot nudging under the table, knuckles brushing by accident that aren’t really accidents, and moments where they catch each other staring a little too long.</p><p> </p><p>Halfway through her coffee, Agatha’s the one who breaks the silence. She doesn’t look up when she says it.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, I have to admit something,” she says with a serious tone and Rio looks at her slightly preoccupied.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her lips, smiling a bit before sighing. “I’ve had a little crush on you for a while,” she admits. “I just didn’t think… any of this would actually happen.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sets her mug down, grinning. “Really? But we never even talked before.” Rio says confused.</p><p> </p><p>“I may have stalked your social media a bit,” Agatha admits, embarrassed. “But I swear I didn't know the store was yours before I came in yesterday.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, you could have just said something, instead of embarrassing me in front of my plants” Rio says, nudging her foot again, reveling in the way Agatha chuckles at that last part. “now that we’ve got that out of our way…how about a real date?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glances up at her, eyes soft, lips curving. “A date?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs, though her smile is anything but casual. “I wouldn’t mind doing this again, you know? The whole morning-after-with-you-wearing-my-clothes thing. But maybe next time, we go out first. Somewhere that doesn’t involve making out in a bar bathroom,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinks. Then she smiles, really smiles. “Yeah. Okay. I’d like that.”</p><p> </p><p>And Rio feels it again, that quiet, steady thud in her chest. Hope. The beginning of something.</p><p> </p><p align="center">🍃🪴🍃</p>
