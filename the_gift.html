<p>Agatha noticed it in phases.</p>
<p>It started with the way Rio wore their clothes. The shift wasn't drastic, just subtle refinements...structured
        jackets, darker colors, clean lines that framed their body like intention made flesh. Their button-downs fit
        closer across the chest now, sleeves rolled up to reveal strong, tan forearms. They wore rings on their fingers
        - thicker, heavier bands - and let their watches peek out from their cuffs.</p>
<p>Agatha had always found Rio attractive. But this? This went beyond the physical. This <em>new</em> confidence,
        this quiet weight they carried with them into every room...it was like gravity. She couldn't <em>not</em> look.
        And Rio either didn't notice or was pretending they didn't.</p>
<p>Then came the muscle.</p>
<p>The change wasn't just in clothes. Rio had started strength training, too. At first, it was just a few gym
        sessions a week. But now it was a full routine and it <em>showed</em>. Agatha found herself openly staring when
        Rio would lift something with one arm, their bicep straining beneath the fabric, veins rising like a map of
        every good decision she'd ever made. Their body had always been beautiful, but now it looked <em>capable</em>.
        Like they could pick Agatha up and carry her to the bed and...</p>
<p>"Jesus," she muttered aloud once, nearly walking into the doorframe while Rio was changing.</p>
<p>And then came the hair.</p>
<p>It had always been long and a little wild. Low-maintenance and messy in a way that made Agatha want to pull it.
        But one afternoon, Rio walked through her door with freshly shorn strands that brushed just above their
        shoulders. Still soft. Still <em>them</em>. But cleaner. Confident.</p>
<p>Agatha was speechless for a beat, eyes raking over them.</p>
<p>Rio smiled shyly. "Too much?"</p>
<p>Agatha shook her head, breathless. "No. You look...<em>handsome</em>."</p>
<p>That one word changed the air between them.</p>
<p>Rio's reaction was subtle...just a lift of the chin, a widening of the eyes, the way their chest seemed to fill
        out like they were suddenly <em>taller</em>. But Agatha saw it. Saw them absorb the word like sunlight.</p>
<p>And she kept seeing it...how they glowed when she used language like that. Not pretty. Not cute. But strong.
        Handsome. Stunning. Sharp.</p>
<p>It made her think.</p>
<p>⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺‧₊☽◯☾₊‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆</p>
<p>It was a lazy Sunday when she asked.</p>
<p>They were sitting on the couch...Rio in a tight tank, one arm slung over the backrest, reading something on their
        phone. Agatha was half-curled against them, half-watching an old episode of Crossing Jordan, tracing the line of
        their bicep with her fingertips and feeling the new muscle there.</p>
<p>"You know," she murmured, voice barely above a whisper, "you've changed recently."</p>
<p>Rio looked down at her, brow slightly furrowed. "Yeah?"</p>
<p>She nodded, not looking away. "Not in a bad way. You just...feel different. You move different. Like you're more
        comfortable in your skin."</p>
<p>Rio was quiet for a moment. Agatha sat up a little, shifting to face them more fully.</p>
<p>"I've noticed how you light up when I use words like 'handsome' or 'strong' or 'sharp'. How you hold yourself
        afterward."</p>
<p>Rio blinked. "I do?"</p>
<p>Agatha smiled gently. "You do. And I <em>love</em> it."</p>
<p>She reached up and ran her fingers through the shorter ends of their hair. "I love watching you evolve. Watching
        you build a self you feel good in."</p>
<p>The silence that followed wasn't heavy. Just thoughtful. Agatha hesitated, toying gently with a piece of hair
        between her fingers as she searched for the right words.</p>
<p>"Is there anything I can do to support you better?" she asked softly.</p>
<p>Rio's eyes searched hers...no panic, just openness. Curiosity. Soft vulnerability.</p>
<p>"Like what?"</p>
<p>"I dunno. Pronouns, maybe...? Like they/them? Or anything else. I just want to make sure I'm loving you the way
        <em>you</em> want to be loved."</p>
<p>Rio's breath caught. Then they smiled wide and quiet, a little stunned. "I think...I'd like to try that."</p>
<p>Agatha beamed, leaning in to press a kiss to their jaw.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>And she let the moment pass like it was nothing. But that night, when she slipped into bed beside them and
        murmured, "Come here, handsome," they did. Without hesitation. Without pause. And when she kissed them, she did
        it with purpose...with her whole self.</p>
<p>Because she wanted to give them <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺‧₊☽◯☾₊‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆</p>
<p>She ordered the strap the next day.</p>
<p>It wasn't an impulsive purchase. They'd talked about it before, mostly in passing. <em>We should try it
            sometime.</em> <em>Would be hot.</em> But between work and life and laziness, it had never made its way from
        conversation into reality.</p>
<p>Now it would.</p>
<p>Not just because it was something new. But because it was something <em>for Rio</em>. For this version of
        them...the one who stood taller, laughed louder, fucked harder, smiled wider every time she called them
        <em>handsome</em>.</p>
<p>Their birthday was coming up.</p>
<p>And Agatha had plans.</p>
<p>⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺‧₊☽◯☾₊‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆</p>
<p>Dinner had been perfect. Candlelight, wine, dessert fed to each other first with spoons and then with fingers.
        They stumbled into the apartment flushed and giggling, Rio's tie already loosened...Agatha's lipstick slightly
        smudged from kisses in the car.</p>
<p>Agatha kicked the door closed behind her and reached for Rio's hand.</p>
<p>"Come here."</p>
<p>Rio followed easily, the kind of smile on their face that always made Agatha feel like she was the only person on
        the planet.</p>
<p>They stood at the foot of the bed, Rio's dark slacks hugging their hips just right, shirt slightly rumpled.
        Agatha pressed a kiss to their jaw, then stepped over to the dresser to retrieve a neatly wrapped black box.</p>
<p>"I have one more present," she said.</p>
<p>Rio's brows lifted with amused intrigue. "Oh?"</p>
<p>Agatha handed it over. Rio unwrapped it with a grin and froze. Inside, nestled in deep plum tissue paper, was a
        harness and a silicone cock. Sleek. Matte. Dark green.</p>
<p>Agatha's voice dropped. "Do you like it?"</p>
<p>Rio was silent for a second too long, just staring. Then, they looked up...pupils blown, breath already shallow.
        "Agatha...I love it."</p>
<p>Agatha bit her lip, eyes gleaming. "Good. Because I really want you to fuck me with it."</p>
<p>Rio's exhale was more like a gasp. "Jesus Christ."</p>
<p>She stepped forward, unfastening the box's straps. "Let me help you put it on."</p>
<p>⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺‧₊☽◯☾₊‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆</p>
<p>Agatha undressed them slowly. Her fingers worked open each button with care, sliding their shirt down their arms.
        She kissed along Rio's shoulders and chest, then dropped to her knees to unfasten their belt.</p>
<p>The slacks hit the floor. They stepped out, now in just black briefs, and Agatha gave a quiet, reverent hum.</p>
<p>"You're so fucking handsome," she said, sliding her hands up their thighs.</p>
<p>Rio's throat worked around a swallow. "You're going to kill me."</p>
<p>She laughed, low and dirty, and held up the harness. "Not before I wreck you first."</p>
<p>With soft instructions and practiced fingers, she showed them how to step in, where to tighten, how to adjust for
        comfort. When she pulled the straps snug around their hips, she took her time palming the base with one hand
        while she kissed along their stomach.</p>
<p>And then she looked up.</p>
<p>"Ready?"</p>
<p>Rio nodded, breathless.</p>
<p>Agatha's hands slid down their thighs. "Good."</p>
<p>⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺‧₊☽◯☾₊‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆</p>
<p>Agatha looked up at Rio, lashes fluttering innocently but then, without breaking eye contact, she leaned forward
        and took the tip of the strap into her mouth...slow...purposeful. She raised it, grinding the textured backplate
        against Rio, and licked a stripe from the base to the tip again. She flicked her tongue against it like she was
        savoring it. </p>
<p>Rio groaned, low in their throat. </p>
<p>Agatha moaned around it, vibrations traveling through the silicone. She bobbed her head, faster now, sloppier,
        her spit beginning to drip down the shaft. It was a slow, steady rhythm. Wet. Deliberate. When she hollowed her
        cheeks and increased her pace, she swore she felt Rio's knees buckle.</p>
<p>"Fuck," Rio rasped, one hand dropping instinctively into Agatha's hair, not to guide or hold her down...just to
        feel her. Feel the motion...the heat.</p>
<p>The sight was obscene. Agatha's lipstick smeared further, her eyes watery and wild. </p>
<p>"Agatha..."</p>
<p>Rio couldn't look away but couldn't move. They stayed there, steadying themselves. Didn't move. Didn't thrust.
        Didn't want to hurt her.</p>
<p>But Agatha...Agatha had other plans.</p>
<p>She let the shaft slide from her mouth with a wet pop, looked up through her lashes, and said, "You don't have to
        be gentle with me."</p>
<p>Rio blinked, and their jaw dropped in both surprise and desire. </p>
<p>She smirked. "In fact..."</p>
<p>Then she sank back down on the strap, slower this time...deeper. Her lips brushed the base, and her throat
        fluttered visibly around the silicone. A quiet choke. Her eyes watered, just a little. And then she moaned
        around it like it was the hottest thing she'd ever done.</p>
<p>Which it probably fucking was.</p>
<p>Rio's entire body lit up like a fucking supernova.</p>
<p>"Agatha...shit..."</p>
<p>Agatha moaned again, that guttural sound vibrating right through the strap. She pulled back only to do it again,
        faster this time, gagging herself with purpose and grinding the base harder against Rio's clit. her nails were
        digging into Rio's thighs, her own thighs clenched, her body rolling with each downward slide like she wanted to
        feel used. Like she wanted to be claimed.</p>
<p>The sensation...pressure, vibration, dominance...hit like a truck.</p>
<p>"Oh my...shit...A-Agatha...I can't...fuck, I'm gonna..."</p>
<p>Rio's fingers tangled in her hair now, just holding on for dear life. Their legs shook, their breath broke, and
        all they could do was try not to collapse as Agatha took them over the edge with nothing but her mouth, her
        throat, and that wicked, filthy look in her eyes.</p>
<p>They came like an avalanche, body seizing up, thighs trembling. Their hips jumped forward, sparking another gag
        as they grinded helplessly against the backplate with a deep, wrecked groan that echoed off the walls. Not a
        little moan. Not a sigh. A sound that tore through them from the inside out.</p>
<p>It was one of the hardest orgasms they'd ever had in their life.</p>
<p>And agatha stayed right there - devoted, relentless - until every last tremor passed.</p>
<p>Only then did she pull away, spit stringing from her lips, cheeks flushed, mascara running down her cheeks, and
        smug as hell. Agatha stood slowly, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand, eyes glowing.</p>
<p>"Happy birthday."</p>
<p>⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺‧₊☽◯☾₊‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆</p>
<p>They were still panting when Agatha leaned in, kissed their jaw, and whispered, "You still with me?"</p>
<p>Rio nodded slowly, brain rebooting. Their whole body felt electric. <em>Buzzing</em>. They could feel themself
        still pulsing against the backplate, wet and slick, but their focus shifted now...fully, hungrily...to the woman
        standing in front of them.</p>
<p>The woman standing there, wiping her lips like she owned Rio's soul. Which...yep, she absolutely did. But she
        didn't have to look so fucking smug about it. </p>
<p>Rio's eyes darkened. Something inside them <em>clicked</em> like the last puzzle piece of this part of them, this
        version of them, finally <em>locked into place</em>.</p>
<p>They grabbed her by the hips.</p>
<p>Agatha let out a surprised little gasp as Rio spun them, guiding her backward onto the bed with an urgency that
        stole both their breaths.</p>
<p>"Oh," she breathed, smiling wide. "Well <em>hellooooo</em> handsome."</p>
<p>Rio didn't answer with words. They kissed her hard, stripping her dress up and off. She wore nothing underneath.
    </p>
<p>Of course she didn't. She <em>knew</em> what she was doing.</p>
<p>Agatha landed with a bounce, chuckling, flushed and ready. </p>
<p>Rio kissed her once...deep, tongue sliding past lips, and pushed her down onto the bed. They climbed over her
        slowly, letting the tip of the strap drag over her thigh. But instead of lining up and driving in immediately,
        Rio leaned down, kissed her...soft at first, then deeper, until Agatha was humming into her mouth, arms wrapping
        around their shoulders and hips lifting, searching, begging to be filled.</p>
<p>Rio smirked into the kiss. "Someone's eager. Not quite yet."</p>
<p>Agatha blinked, eyes already heavy with lust. "What do you mean, 'not yet'? Please, my love!"</p>
<p>"No," Rio murmured, brushing her lips down over Agatha's sternum, her stomach, her hips. "You're <em>eager</em>.
        But I want you <em>desperate</em>."</p>
<p>Agatha whimpered.</p>
<p>Rio slid down between her legs, hands on her thighs, spreading her open with the kind of care that felt like
        reverence.</p>
<p>"You looked so good with your mouth on me," she said, pressing a kiss just above Agatha's clit. "Now it's my
        turn."</p>
<p>Rio licked a slow stripe with the flat of their tongue, letting it flick at the end before pulling back just to
        watch Agatha's whole body twitch. One hand gripped Agatha's thigh; the other dipped lower, sliding two fingers
        through the slick mess between her legs.</p>
<p>"So wet already," Rio murmured, teasing her entrance but not pushing in. "Did it turn you on this much?"</p>
<p>Agatha moaned, hips rocking up.</p>
<p>Rio just smiled against her. "Ah ah ah...use your words"</p>
<p>Agatha huffed. "Rio..."</p>
<p>Another kiss, lower. Another pass of their tongue. This time, they circled the clit slowly, then sucked, just
        once..just hard enough to pull a sound from Agatha's throat she hadn't meant to make.</p>
<p>"Please," Agatha whispered.</p>
<p>"Please what?"</p>
<p>"I need you inside."</p>
<p>Rio slid two fingers inside her, slow and steady.</p>
<p>Agatha gasped.</p>
<p>Rio's tongue went back to work while their fingers moved inside Agatha...curling, pressing, stroking just right.
        Finding that perfect rhythm...slow enough to tease, deep enough to make Agatha <em>feel it</em>, with every wet
        sound exaggerated by how <em>completely undone</em> she already was.</p>
<p>Agatha was writhing now, head turned to the side, one fist clutching the pillow, the other buried in Rio's hair.
    </p>
<p>Her hips rolled shamelessly, chasing more. "God, please...<em>please</em>, Rio...<em>please give me your
            cock</em>."</p>
<p>Rio froze. </p>
<p>Like a wire had been pulled tight inside their chest and snapped.</p>
<p>Agatha was flushed, panting, glistening between her legs and she was looking at them like that while asking...no
        <em>begging</em>...for their cock. Not <em>the</em> cock. <em>Their</em> cock.</p>
<p>Something primal and aching broke loose in Rio's chest.</p>
<p>They blinked, breath caught in their throat, and let out a sound somewhere between a groan and a gasp. Their
        whole body went hot, heart pounding like a war drum.</p>
<p>"You can't just say shit like that," they whispered hoarsely.</p>
<p>Agatha smirked...barely holding on. "I just did."</p>
<p>Rio swore under their breath. "Say it again."</p>
<p>She tilted her head, eyes gleaming. "Give me your cock, pretty boy."</p>
<p>Rio's hands trembled as they reached for her thighs, dragging them up around their waist.</p>
<p>"Fuck...Agatha"</p>
<p>They lined up, guided the head of the strap to her entrance, and didn't tease. Didn't draw it out. They slid
        inside in one smooth, needy thrust that knocked the air out of both of them.</p>
<p>Agatha cried out, clutching at their back. And Rio? Rio had never felt more real in their entire life.</p>
<p>Rio hooked her thighs over their hips, angling deeper. Their rhythm was powerful, relentless, slamming into her
        over and over.</p>
<p>"Oh my fucking god <em>Rio</em> "</p>
<p>Rio groaned, forehead pressed to hers, their hips rolling like they couldn't stop even if they wanted to. "You
        feel so fucking good. Look at you. Taking my cock like you were <em>made for it</em>."</p>
<p>Agatha clawed at their back, legs wrapping tighter around them, her body arching with every thrust. Her orgasm
        hit fast and hot, shuddering through her like lightning. She sobbed into Rio's neck, still being pounded through
        the aftershocks.</p>
<p>But Rio wasn't done.</p>
<p>They flipped her over and pushed her knees apart. Rio grasped the base of the strap and ran the tip through her
        folds. Agatha whimpered and tried to press back into it, feeling empty.</p>
<p>They lined up and thrust inside with a deep, smooth stroke that made Agatha all but scream. Her head fell forward
        as Rio set a pace that was deliberate but intense, every trust rolanding just right. </p>
<p>"You wanted this, didn't you? Wanted me to fuck you like this?" Rio's voice was rough now, all control gone.</p>
<p>"Yes...yes, <em>please</em>..."</p>
<p>"You're gonna come all over my cock, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"God yes. I'm so close..."</p>
<p>Rio slowed for half a second...just to make her wait...and whispered darkly, "Not yet."</p>
<p>Agatha whimpered, dropping to her forearms, barely holding herself upright.</p>
<p>"You're going to take what I give you," Rio said, voice low and commanding. "Like a good girl."</p>
<p>And then they doubled down...slamming their hips forward with renewed, feral speed, the base of the strap
        grinding mercilessly against their clit. It was almost too much. Almost.</p>
<p>Their hand slid up Agatha's back and wrapped firmly around her throat...not tight, just enough to pull her
        upright. To make her feel it. The new angle made Agatha's entire body shudder, the head of Rio's cock slamming
        against her g-spot relentlessly.</p>
<p>Her voice cracked into whines, panting with every thrust.</p>
<p>"Please please please..."</p>
<p>"Tell me baby. Tell me what you need" Rio growled, fucking her harder.</p>
<p>Agatha choked on a sob, her whole body convulsing.</p>
<p>"P-please...fuck...come inside me...please...so full...I need it...need you..."</p>
<p>That broke Rio. Their hips stuttered for a moment, right on the edge, breath coming in frantic gasps as Agatha
        thrashed beneath them.</p>
<p>And then, voice wrecked and raw, they said, "Come for me."</p>
<p>Agatha shattered.</p>
<p>She screamed, legs trembling violently, eyes rolling back as her body locked up around the strap. Her orgasm hit
        hard and didn't stop, tearing through her like fire. Rio kept going, riding every wave of it, their own climax
        ready to explode like a thunderclap. The strap shoved the textured plate deep into their clit...once, twice
        more...finally sending Rio over the edge with a ragged gasp, hips jerking, fingers digging into Agatha's skin.
    </p>
<p>Everything blurred.</p>
<p>They collapsed to the bed in a heap of limbs.</p>
<p>The room spun.</p>
<p>Time stopped.</p>
<p>⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺⋆˖⁺‧₊☽◯☾₊‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆‧⁺˖⋆</p>
<p>The strap, still snug between them, shifted slightly as they lay tangled together.</p>
<p>Agatha snorted, then burst into a quiet giggle. "Okay, I love you, but your cock is trying to start round two."
    </p>
<p>Rio blinked, barely coherent. "What?"</p>
<p>She tilted her hips, wiggling a bit. Rio groaned. "Shit...sorry. Forgot I was still wearing it."</p>
<p>"Don't apologize." Agatha grinned as she reached down to unfasten the harness. "Just means you really committed."
    </p>
<p>Rio let her do it, watching dazed as Agatha carefully unbuckled the straps and slid the harness off. She set it
        aside with a soft thunk and curled back into Rio's chest, kissing their collarbone.</p>
<p>They stayed like that for a while. Warm. Quiet. The kind of silence that isn't empty, but full with everything
        they hadn't said yet.</p>
<p>And then Rio whispered, "That was more than I expected."</p>
<p>Agatha looked up, curious and still breathless. "Yeah?"</p>
<p>Rio nodded slowly. "Not just the sex. Though, Jesus Christ..."</p>
<p>Agatha laughed, smug and wrecked.</p>
<p>Rio smiled back. Then, softer, "It wasn't about the strap. Or getting off. It was...the way you looked at me. The
        way you touched me. You weren't playing along or pretending or trying to make a point. You just saw me. And you
        wanted me like that."</p>
<p>Agatha's smile faded into something deeper. "Of course I wanted you."</p>
<p>Rio nodded, their voice starting to shake a little. "Yeah. But it hit me all at once. That you weren't just
        saying it or tolerating it. You looked at me like...like I belonged like this. Like I made sense."</p>
<p>Agatha blinked, throat tightening.</p>
<p>"I've been trying to feel that way for a long time," Rio murmured. "But I don't think I really believed it until
        tonight."</p>
<p>Agatha pressed her forehead to theirs, kissed them gently. "You are so easy to love, you know that?"</p>
<p>Rio laughed, quiet and uneven.</p>
<p>Agatha smiled. "I don't care how you dress, or what you call yourself, or which end of the strap you're wearing.
        You're mine. And I see all of you."</p>
<p>Rio swallowed hard and pulled her in tight, burying their face in Agatha's neck.</p>
<p>"Thank you," they whispered.</p>
<p>Agatha held them there, fingers stroking the back of their head. "You never have to thank me for loving you" she
        said softly. "Now stop crying on me and go to sleep."</p>
<p>Rio chuckled, breath hitching.</p>
<p>And that's how they fell asleep...tangled together, bodies sated, hearts full. </p>
<p>"Best birthday ever."</p>
