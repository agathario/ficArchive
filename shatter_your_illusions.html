<div class="userstuff">
<p>It’s been a long time since Agatha was properly fucked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The past few years have been full of unfulfilling hookups and the occasional relationship that petered out after a few weeks. All things considered, her sex life had been pretty bleak since her last real relationship turned sour.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Which is how Agatha found herself creating a new AOL account. And joining a local bdsm chat room. And writing very explicit directions in her away message.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>AIM AWAY MESSAGE: Dyke seeking <u><b>EXPERIENCED</b></u> shibari play partner. If you’re strapping and know how to tie, introduce yourself for a compatibility quiz.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>One thing Agatha was not going to do is waste time reaching out to a bunch of randos in a chat room. She needed to streamline the process. Let people weed themselves out if they weren’t a match. Let the cream rise to the top as they say.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She had spent the last few months committed to the very arduous process of trying to find a play partner in the wild. But finding someone with the interest <em>and experience </em>in exploring ropes play was proving impossible. Mostly because every woman she talked to seemed more interested in exploring the possibly of a relationship instead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha would rarely admit to being jealous of men, but lesbians could really learn a thing or two about the culture of accessible casual sex that gay men have cultivated.</p><p>Cue the wonders of the world wide web. Gone are the days of missed connection ads in the newspaper. Now if you want to find someone, you can cast a line in your local kink chat room and wait for the little fishes to bite.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sure you might need to dodge a serial killer or two, but what’s the point of life if you’re not living on the edge a little.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The compatibility quiz was maybe a step too far. But she really wanted to skip the awkward niceties and know if someone was even remotely on the same page as her before she invested any time in talking. When she ran the idea past her best friend, Jen called it certifiably narcissistic, but intriguingly efficient. Perfect. That’s exactly what Agatha was going for.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The first few people to reach out immediately took themselves out of the running. Outside the city? No. Self described bubblegum fem? What the fuck does that even mean? First time, but willing to learn? Absolutely not. What part of *experienced* in all caps, bolded, and underlined implied they would be compatible? Hard pass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>After several weeks and zero viable candidates, Agatha considered giving up. The only person who even vaguely fit the perimeters of Agatha’s very specific needs had ruined it all with saying they’d “be game to play” <em>after</em> casually dating for a while. What. The. Fuck. People. That is not what’s happening here. In fact, it’s the opposite of what’s happening here.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Instead of rage deleting her account like she originally planned, she decided to update her away message as a last ditch attempt to clarify for the universe exactly what she was manifesting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Ropes only, no strings.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>There. That’s more clear. She wants someone to tie her up, not take her on a date and book a u-haul. God damn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>And maybe the universe was finally listening, because within minutes she received a new message.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><b>RiverBankShot:<br/>
</b>Hi I’m Rio. Do I get to ask you a question first or is this quiz like a bridge troll that’s gatekeeping a conversation?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>PurpleLilith:<br/>
</b>Excuse you, my quiz is great. Why are you even messaging if you’re judging (¬_¬)</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:<br/>
</b>The quiz comes off high maintenance. Honestly, it scared me off until I saw you’re looking for casual play, no strings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span>Fine. You get one question. Don’t waste it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:<br/>
</b>Oh shit… I was just going to ask A/S/L but that feels… inadequate. So… what’s your screen name mean?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span></b>Guess.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:<br/>
</b>I assume it means you’re a sexually deviant primordial spirit that loves to cause havoc. And that your favorite color is purple.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span></b>Accurate. <br/>
See you didn’t need to ask a question, you guessed it right.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span>What does yours mean?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:<br/>
</b>Umm it’s kind of a basketball pun. Like a river bank. But then a bank shot. Like when you hit the backboard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span></b>Okay dyke.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span>Do you want the quiz or not?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:<br/>

<p><b>RiverBankShot:<br/>
</b>Switch? You give off strong top energy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:<br/>
</b>Fair. That’s part of what I’m interesting in exploring.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:<br/>
</b>Good to know. And for the record, I find an explicit aftercare rider to be appealing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:<br/>
</b>Hmm see, that’s giving really subby top energy. Are you sure you can be trusted with this responsibility?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:<br/>
</b>Preferring explicit communication isn’t subby. It just means I like a women who knows what she wants. And is vocal about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:<br/>
</b>Well. I want to meet. Are you free Saturday?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:<br/>
</b>Yes. How about The Road on 18th?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:<br/>
</b>Great. See you at 8pm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Agatha is pretty smitten with herself to be honest. It look a few misses, but she might have found a match. She was riding that high until she heard the AIM notification go off again an hour or so later.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Ugh, this girl better not be a stage five clinger.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:<br/>
</b>Quick question. Is this just a visual exploration for you? Or is there a chance it’s also visceral? Like, physically.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:<br/>
</b>Ummmm I feel like the answer to this question is that shibari is, inherently, both??</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:</b><br/>
Okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span>But what I’m really asking is…<br/>
What are the chances we fuck?<br/>
Or like, is this exclusively just for the experience of being on the receiving side of rope art. <br/>
I want to align on expectations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:</b><br/>
Well, the chances WERE high but that probability is going down every time you ask a question.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:</b><br/>
Fuck do my questions from earlier count?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span>WAIT<br/>
Don’t answer that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span>Pretend I didn’t ask that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span>Okay not to further dig myself into a hole…<br/>
But one more question.<br/>
Is that aftercare rider like a list you could share? Just want to be prepared.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:<br/>
</b>That’s actually a great question, I won’t dock you points for that one.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Not to immediately contradict myself. But since I’ve never done this before, I don’t exactly know what I’d want for aftercare.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:<br/>
</b>What do you do for other people? Maybe we can start there?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:<br/>
</b>» color check<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span>» untie ropes<br/>
» preliminary check for bruises<br/>
» wash any accessories<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span>» warm up a washcloth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span>» full body check again with said washcloth<br/>
» apply bruise balm<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span>» check in again before leaving room<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span>» procure snack (sweet or salty, depends on preference) and water<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span>» pack bag and leave<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:</b><br/>
You don’t stay?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:<br/>
</b>Usually not, no. Is that going to be a problem for you?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:</b><br/>
I might need like a few minutes to decompress, at least.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span>And honestly, if I do my job right, you will also need time to land back in your body. Feel fully present. Not sure I’d feel comfortable with you leaving immediately. But I can compromise and not expect you to stay overnight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:<br/>
</b>Fair. You can set a 30 minute timer and we can reassess then.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:</b><br/>
Roger that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:</b><br/>
Any other questions?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:</b><br/>
Well… is there anything you think you’d want different than your usual ritual?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:<br/>
</b>Umm. Maybe tea instead of water?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span>And maybe music afterward? Like during snack time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>If Agatha had to stay for a full half an hour, she could run down the clock by making Rio boil some tea water. And she’ll let a stranger tie her up, but there is zero chance she’ll be doing a debrief. So music is a must. No awkward silences to fill.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p><b>RiverBankShot:</b><br/>
Okay. Those can both be arranged.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/>
</span>The clock starts when I get back with the tea though.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Well, fuck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p><b>PurpleLilith:</b><br/>
Fine.</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>~ ~ ~<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>On Saturday night, Agatha walked from her apartment to The Road, a dive bar in the heart of the city’s gayborhood. She was wearing her favorite peachy-pink blazer, light wash jeans and chunky loafers. Eye makeup kind of dark and smudgey. Long hair wild and parted on the side. It was a look that felt both like armor and a target. Something that made her feel confident and protected from the outside world, but also screamed gay.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It had been a few days since she last talked to Rio, who luckily refrained from hitting up Agatha with any additional questions. And something about the anonymity of the whole thing made her excited. She walked in the bar, nerves buzzing and riding a high that nothing could ruin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Nothing except maybe her ex. Who was, of fucking course, one of the seven people currently in this tiny dive bar. The universe was not making this easy for Agatha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Her ex is quite literally the last person she would want to see in this moment. They haven’t spoken in years and she does not need that to change now. Her ex could be… difficult. Classic case of young love that outgrew each other. She would never admit it, but in hindsight Agatha can acknowledge her own slightly unpredictable attachment style was definitely a factor.</p><p>Agatha purposely found a seat on the other side of the bar, hoping to not catch her ex’s attention. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What the fuck, Agatha? You’re not supposed to be here. I called dibs on this bar in the breakup.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Fuck, Victoria noticed her. Agatha rolled her eyes before dignifying this outburst with a response.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You can’t just call bids on an establishment and honestly expect me to never step foot in it again, Vic. There are only so many gay bars in this city.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“And this one is mine. You can literally go to any other one, I just wanted this one place to myself.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Against her better judgement, Agatha stood up and walked over to where Victoria was sitting at the bar. She didn’t want to have this fight. But it seemed inevitable, so she’d at least try to avoid them making a scene. They could handle this like adults. Hopefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Look, Victoria. It’s been three years. There’s gotta be a statute of limitations on dibs. This is ridiculous.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No. You have to leave. You can’t stay. Just leave, Agatha. Why do you always have to be so difficult?”</p><p>“I can’t leave. Not tonight. After tonight, I’ll let you have your little bar. But I’m meeting someone and I don’t want to stand them up. So you’re going to have to be a big girl and coexist under the same roof. Okay?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Not okay. Why are you meeting them here?!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Because they suggested it,” Agatha snapped. “And it would have been absolutely unhinged for me to say the words no sorry I can’t, my ex has custody of that bar so I’m not allowed.” The whiney pitch of Agatha’s voice made her want to cringe. This was not the headspace she wanted to be in tonight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Seems perfectly reasonable to me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“And this is why we broke up, Victoria. Because your standard of what is reasonable is so drastically disconnected from reality that it makes it impossible to coexist peacefully.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Don’t call me that.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The sudden tone shift startled Agatha. Victoria sounded genuinely hurt. Which like fair, okay maybe Agatha took it a little too far. But that was always their dynamic. Antagonist and bratty until the argument bubbled over into the territory of sexual tension and one of them finally snapped. It wasn’t a sustainable relationship dynamic. But it was fun. Until it wasn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Don’t call you impossible? I’ve honestly called you worse,” Agatha said dismissively.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No. Don’t call me Victoria.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What? That’s your fucking name, Vic. Am I not allowed to say your name either? God you are such a colossal pain in my ass.“<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Just stop, okay? That’s not… I don’t… no one calls me that anymore. So I’m asking you, please don’t say it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“And what pray-tell am I supposed to call you then?” Agatha said dramatically, closing her eyes and refusing to look at her ex.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Rio. I go by Rio now.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha snapped her head to look at Victori — Rio. Fuck fuck fuck. No. Absolutely not. There is no way. Does the universe hate her? This cannot be happening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Wait, how is this happening? Did Agatha really never say her name? Did Vic… Rio. Did Rio agree to meet a stranger without even asking their name?! This is a perfect example of how her ex’s sense of what is normal just doesn’t align with Agatha. This whole encounter, disaster really, boils down to her ex’s bad judgement. Ugh no.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s not entirely true. Agatha is the one who initiated this rather reckless endeavor. And blindly blaming her ex anytime something went wrong is a pattern that Agatha can <em>maybe</em> recognize is a little unfair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha didn’t know how long she’d been staring at Rio. But she realized she had to think quick. Right now, she had the upper hand. She had to decide whether she was going to play her cards or keep them close to her chest. Think, think, think.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She landed on stalling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Okay, Riooo,” Agatha said in a sing-song tone. Rio flinched and Agatha immediately wished she could take that back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She reached out and put her hand on Rio’s forearm. Deep breath. Take two.</p><p>“Okay, Rio,” she tried again, voice no longer condescending. “Say more. About that. Please.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It wasn’t great. Certainly not the most elegant reaction. But it bought her time to decide how to play this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I mean… Victoria never really fit me. It was too… feminine? Refined? It just wasn’t me,” Rio said. She clenched her jaw like she was bracing for impact, expecting Agatha to rub salt in what’s clearly still a healing wound.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>For once, Agatha chose softness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yea, I know,” she started. “That’s why I always called you Vic. It fit you better.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>But it was met with silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Why didn’t you just stick with Vic? Also gender ambiguous…” Agatha continued.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No one else called me that,” Rio said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yea well, no one was calling you Rio either. So if you’re picking a new name, it’s gunna take some effort to get people to adopt it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No, I mean, you were the only person who called me that. And I’ve spent the last three years trying to figure out who I am. Not just who I was trying to be when I was with you. I couldn’t let your nickname become my identity. That… just… it would have been too hard.” Rio took a deep breath, shoulders sinking a little lower and chin raising a little higher. An attempt to take up space and not just melt away.</p><p>And that’s when Agatha finally noticed, Rio was carrying herself differently. And it wasn’t just her butchy sleeveless vest and how it exposed a double half sleeve tattoo. Or the chopped hair. Or the… seven piercings in her ear. Or the gay-as-fuck perfectly worn in boots.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>No it was something else. Like Rio’s aura was glowing a different color. <em>Okayyyyy</em>, Agatha thought to herself, <em>stop psychoanalyzing your ex’s aura color. That’s literally too gay.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>When they first met, Victoria was awkward in an endearing theatre nerd kind of way. To the world, she was quiet. Disinterested. Detached. Only Agatha saw the moments where Victoria was vulnerable enough to let her actual personality come out. That was part of the ongoing strain on their relationship though. Seeing how different Victoria was in public versus private moments really unsettled Agatha. Tripped some sort of long-ago wired belief that a disconnect like that, the duality of a public and private persona, was somehow unsafe. In this moment though, Agatha felt like she was looking at a version of her ex where those two sides of her were more integrated. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>And where Victoria had always been a little fragile — mercurial, slightly unstable — Rio now sat in front of Agatha very solidly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even clearly rattled by this conversation, there was a quiet sturdiness that grounded Rio. Agatha found it soothing. Like they could coexist in friction without it sparking Agatha’s nervous system into chaos.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was in that moment that she realized her hand was still on Rio’s arm. She squeezed it and took a deep breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Thank you for sharing that,” Agatha said quietly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yea whatever,” Rio said and then turned on her bar stool to fully face Agatha and lock eyes. “Now please kindly fuck off, because I am also meeting someone and I would very much like it if you disappeared now.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The reality of the situation hit Agatha again. Right. Right. Right. <em>Fuck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>“It’s me. Fuck, I literally forgot for a moment. You are waiting for me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No I’m not,” Rio said reflexively while physically shaking her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha’s eyes scrunched closed and her jaw tensed. She stretched out her fingers to try to dispel some of her nervous energy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yes. Yes you are, River Bank Shot.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha nervously touched her fingers to her own lips. She really had no idea how Rio was going to react to this information.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Noooooooo. Fuck me.” Rio sat there in shock, eyes wide and slightly unfocused. Like she also had to mentally run through the list of fallen dominoes that led them to this moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I mean… if the offer is still on the table,” Agatha said with a smirk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio looked at her. Head cocked to the side like a puppy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You don’t mean that. Do you?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was Agatha’s turn to glitch for a moment. Did she mean it? She didn’t <em>not</em> mean it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“We don’t have to decide this very moment,” is what Agatha eventually settled on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“We can set a 30 minute timer and reassess,” she continued when she saw Rio’s face soften at her initial reply.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio laughed and poked her tongue into the side of her cheek. That’s cute. New. <em>Rio didn’t use to do that</em>, Agatha thought to herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Carol!” Rio said suddenly, jilting Agatha out of her thoughts. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yea, Ri?” the bartender replied from a few feet away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Do you have a timer? Like in the kitchen? That I can borrow for a few?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Sure thing, boss.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha watched as this interaction unfolded, a little bit in awe of the person sitting next to her and the way she navigates through the world now. It was such a simple thing, yet so different than how Victoria would have reacted to Agatha’s joke.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The next twenty seven and a half minutes went by surprisingly quickly. It was easy to fall back into a rhythm with Rio, almost as if the past three years hadn’t happened. But also… they were definitely different people than before. Almost strangers. The dichotomy made Agatha feel a little floaty, like she wasn’t fully existing in the present moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hey wait,” Agatha said when she realized something. “You said you were 35! That’s a blatant lie.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The accusation was real, but her tone was playful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I don’t know man, age is kinda meaningless. Sometime around 27, I started considering myself 30. And that lasted until a few months ago when I turned 33. And now my brain rounds up to 35 and I’ll probably be 35 until I’m like 37, maybe 38. And then I’ll be 40.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“That… weirdly makes sense for you,” Agatha laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>At that moment, the timer went off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The two of them locked eyes silently. And then, without breaking eye contact, Rio reached over to the timer and reset it wordlessly. Agatha smiled. And if she noticed that Rio had turned the dial past 30 minutes this time, she didn’t say anything.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“So… why shibari?” Rio asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Ummm because if I just said ropes, I would have ended up with someone restraining my wrists to a bed post and thinking that’s enough. And I was looking for someone who can spin a web of rope around me like a spider. Wait, you can do that right?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yes. But that didn’t really answer my question.”</p><p>“I guess… I wanted to know what it feels like. I do enjoy being the one doing the tying. The repetition of the knots, it almost feels ritualistic. But doing it also makes me jealous? Like I crave the feeling of the rope on my skin. It’s almost like I miss the feeling of being secure even though I’ve never felt it before… I want to know what it feels like to surrender. So I tried to find someone who would do that for me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“And you thought a stranger you found in a chat room was the best person to experience that with?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hmm the person the universe sent me didn’t exactly turn out to be a stranger.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio looked at her almost a beat too long before answering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I couldn’t have been the first person to reach out to you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha laughed at that. And then proceeded to tell Rio about the handful of failed candidates before her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Bubblegum fem?” Rio laughed. “I am pretty sure that’s a strain of weed I smoked in Amsterdam once.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Either way, that was a deal breaker for me.”</p><p>“Well obviously. Couldn’t have two bubblegum femmes,” Rio said while gesturing at Agatha’s blazer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Oh fuck you,” Agatha laughed while shaking her head and playing with the buttons on the sleeve of her blazer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yea… fuck me,” Rio replied.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha looked up at Rio through her lashes, almost not believing what she heard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yea?” she asked with raised brows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio just slowly nodded yes in response.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was Agatha’s turn to pick up the timer,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>turning it off this time. She then pulled $20 out of her back pocket to cover their drinks and a sizable tip.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Let’s go.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>It turns out Rio now lives in one of the loft apartments literally across the street from the bar. Fine, maybe it’s semi-reasonable for Rio to have demanded custody of that bar in the breakup. But you won’t catch Agatha vocalizing that thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She’s quickly distracted anyway, eyes drifting to Rio’s hand where she’s unclipping her keys from her belt loop. And that’s when Agatha notices something interesting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The moment Rio opens the door, Agatha pushes her inside and pins her against the closest wall. She presses her lower body against Rio and smirked. Rio was strapped and packing. <em>Hot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>“I thought so,” Agatha whispered in Rio’s ear. “Is this a special occasion kinda thing or a regular occurrence for you these days?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’ll have to stick around a while and find out,” Rio replied, her voice a little raspy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha leaned in like she was going to kiss Rio, but at the last moment she diverted and let her teeth drag against the left side of Rio’s jaw. A little love bite.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She walked away and then fluffed her hair as she turned back to look at Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Time to get to work, pretty boy.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha smiled when she heard the noise that escaped Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The moment Agatha stepped into Rio’s bedroom, the floaty feeling came back. She’d never been in <em>this</em> room before, but it felt familiar. Rio’s acoustic guitar leaning up against the wall. A leather accent chair that Agatha was <em>intimately</em> familiar with. A framed photo she knows Rio took herself. No less than seven houseplants.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s finger tips graze her arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You okay?” Rio asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>For as much bravado as Agatha felt a moment ago, she could only muster a small nod.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Sit down,” Rio said, nodding to the chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha sat, feeling surprisingly grateful for the explicit instructions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Any hard limits?” Rio asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hmmm usually my ground rules for ropes play are no pet names, no other kink exploration without explicit verbal consent, and basic color system. I think those all still apply here.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You think?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Maybe… not the first one.”</p><p>Rio smiled at that, her cheeks getting a little flushed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Any positions or specific restraints off limits?” Rio clarified.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I don’t think so.”</p><p>“Since it’s your first time, I’m going to check in a lot. Like almost to the point where it’s annoying. So if we’re ever venturing into territory that you’re not sure you like, we can course-correct. Okay?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha nodded. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Anything else?” Agatha asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes slightly and inhaled sharply before responding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I have a question. Because you didn’t list it as a limit, but I’m not sure how you feel about it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Okay?” Agatha said, unsure of what exactly Rio was referring to.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Am I allowed to kiss you?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The question caught Agatha off guard. Because she honestly hadn’t thought about it. But she could see why her antics in the hallway made Rio ask.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yes,” she answered. She felt a ghost of a tingle run down her spine, it was the most grounded she'd been in her body since walking into the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Okay. Good.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio walked over to Agatha and reached both her hands out, Agatha instinctively reaching back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Stand up… kick your shoes off,” Rio said while squeezing Agatha’s hands to help her balance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>This is new. To Agatha. Rio had never done this particular move with her in the past. But it felt habitual, like it wasn’t the first time Rio had done it. Which Agatha tried not to think about.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio let go of Agatha’s hands and then placed one of hers on Agatha’s chest where the lapels of her blazer overlapped.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Can I take this off?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s fingers undo the one button holding the jacket closed. Rio took it off, eyes drifting slowly down and then back up Agatha’s exposed body.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You really didn’t wear anything under it? Just completely bare. Not even a bra. To meet a stranger?” Rio said with a deadpan tone, just a hint of degrading sarcasm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Good, Rio was also thinking about the concept of Agatha with someone else. They’re even now.</p><p>“Are you surprised, babe?” Agatha replied shamelessly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio did that crooked smile thing again with her tongue and all Agatha could think about is how she wants to do at least one thing everyday that will elicit that reaction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><em>Every day?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p><em>What the fuck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>Agatha tried not to dwell on <em>that</em> particular thought any longer. There were more pressing matters at hand. Like how Rio was currently unbuckling Agatha’s belt and slowly pulling it free before dramatically letting it drop to the floor. <em>Damn. Okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>“Where was this version of you three years ago?” Agatha asked, sounding more affected than she expected to be at this stage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“She didn’t exist yet.”</p><p>The words hit Agatha hard. The implication being this version of Rio couldn’t have existed back then. <em>Only</em> existed because of the years they spent apart. Another thought Agatha wished didn’t intrude into her headspace. Because that was… a lot. Too much. For this moment. Maybe any moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio slowly dropped to her knees and looked up at Agatha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hands on my shoulders,” Rio commanded softly. Agatha complied with no hesitation. It was easier than she expected to fall into a more submissive role. Maybe Rio wasn’t the only one who evolved since their last time together.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She felt Rio slip fingers between denim and skin, then pull on the fabric with her other hand. The five buttons holding the high waisted jeans together released one-by-one in succession under the tension.</p><p>Agatha’s thoughts finally started to quiet as she felt Rio take her jeans off. Rio’s finger tips then started tracing the spot where lace met the silky smoothness of Agatha’s left hip.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“On or off?” Rio asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Off.”</p><p>The tactile feel of the lace boyshorts being dragged down her thighs made Agatha shiver. Rio reached for one of her hands to steady her again and the lace quickly ending up in the growing pile of clothes on the chair behind Agatha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio, still on her knees, leaned forward and hesitated just for a moment to inhale slowly before leaving a kiss on the now exposed hair of Agatha’s bush.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><em>Freak. Somethings do not change, apparently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>“Color?” Rio asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Green.”</p><p>Rio stood up and retrieved a coil of rope that had been laid out in preparation. She expertly found the middle of the line and quickly looped the long rope several times making a loose little knot in the shape of a tear drop. She then silently pressed the knot into Agatha’s chest and Agatha reflexively placed a hand on it to hold it steady. Rio looped the two lengths of rope on either side of the knot up around Agatha’s shoulders. Down around her ribs and woven through the knot. And then back up and around again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Color?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Still green.”</p><p>Rio took the leftover rope on the right side and started daisychaining knots down Agatha’s arm. She then repeated the process on the left.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Still okay?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t feel bad, per se. She just didn’t really feel at all though maybe... Even when watching Rio’s fingers wrap the rope around her, it was like she could feel the ropes but not herself against them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yes.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’m going to check to make sure things aren’t too tight before we go any farther.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She closed her eyes as she felt Rio place one and then two fingers under various places where the rope was spun around her skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Okay… maybe a little easier to coexist with the ropes now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p><p>Rio picked up a second length and once again found the center. She wrapped it around Agatha’s hips and threaded either end through little cuff link loops on the ropes around her wrists before twisting it into another harness around her hips. Asymmetrically maybe? It felt heavier on her left side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Looking down, Agatha saw the teardrop knot kind of pulse, quivering in time with her heart beat. Shouldn’t it be moving more?</p><p>Oh right, Agatha should be breathing. She gulped in some air, not sure how long she’d been holding her breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The knot didn’t move though, it stayed secure and offered a little resistance, pressure against Agatha’s expanding rib cage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha took another breath, deeper this time, watching her breasts swell around the knot. Expand. Contract. The knot stayed stable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Can you hold this for me?” Rio asked while placing the rest of the rope in Agatha’s hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Is it okay if I pick you up and bring you to the bed now?” she continued.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha’s legs weren’t restrained at all, there was no real need for Rio to carry her. But she wanted to feel that… Rio’s arms around her in some way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yes.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The world shifted a little when Rio silently picked her up, bridal style.</p><p>Agatha felt herself settle onto the mattress, followed by the feeling of Rio climbing into bed next to her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’re being uncharacteristically quiet, Agatha.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio wasn’t wrong. Usually Rio couldn’t get Agatha to stop talking unless she found a way to occupy her mouth. But right now, Agatha felt herself sinking into the hazy bliss of subspace. It felt nice. Almost like the floaty feeling she gets sometimes. But different. Better. Safer. Secure, instead of untethered. She liked it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Color?” Rio asked when Agatha didn’t answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>In that moment, Agatha <em>was</em> almost annoyed by the frequency of Rio’s check ins. But maybe Rio was the thing tethering her. Letting her mind float while her body sunk. Or was it the opposite? Her body was floating and her mind sunk? Agatha didn’t have the right words to describe the feeling. She was kind of existing in a space where words didn’t really seem right at all. Like trying to contain this feeling inside the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>structure of a word felt impossible.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Agathaaa,” Rio said softly, trying to coax Agatha back from the haze. Agatha looked toward the sound of Rio’s voice and found her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“There you are,” Rio said once they made eye contact.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Color?” she asked once again.</p><p>Agatha blinked slowly and told herself to say the word green.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yellow.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha wondered why she said yellow. But then she realized it wasn’t her voice that said it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio moved closer to Agatha and reached her hand to touch the side of Agatha’s face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’m calling yellow,” Rio said softly.</p><p>Agatha felt the words before her brain consciously heard them. She tensed up. Suddenly feeling more in her body, but maybe not in a good way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“It’s okay that you’re quiet. But it’s not okay if you can’t communicate,” Rio continued. “Do words feel hard right now?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha felt her head nod yes. She took a shallow breath and her whole body shivered, suddenly covered with goosebumps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio moved closer and laid flat on top of Agatha, letting her feel the full weight of her body. Agatha had woken up so many mornings before to the feeling of Rio being her own human-shaped blanket, the familiarity of it felt comforting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio placed both hands on Agatha’s cheeks, thumbs brushing away tears that Agatha hadn’t realized were falling until that moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Here’s what’s going to happen. We’re going to stay like this for a moment. And you’re going to breathe with me. Five counts in, five counts out. And then I’m going to adjust your ties. I’m not undoing all the knots down your arms. But I am going to release the rope around your hips so that your arms aren’t restrained anymore. But for now, just breathe.”</p><p>Agatha could feel the tips of Rio’s fingers lightly tapping her cheekbones, counting. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. In time with the rhythm of her heart beat. She wasn’t sure which slowed down first. Rio’s fingers or her own pulse. Maybe it was mirror neurons slowing them down together.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio reached back to pull out a grey bandana from her back left pocket and used it to fix Agatha’s smudged mascara.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>After a moment, Rio shifted her attention down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Can you put your feet flat on the bed for me? Good. Can you press your hips up a little? Good.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure exactly how, but she felt Rio move so that Agatha could relax again without being fully on the mattress. Like she was anchored and suspended all at once, letting Rio easily reverse the rope that had been wrapped around her hips.</p><p>She could feel Rio unthread the ends out of the loops around her wrists, her arms no longer secured to her sides. Rio placed the rope on the bed next to them and took Agatha’s hands in her own, squeezing them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Okay, Agatha. New color system. This hand,” Rio said while holding Agatha’s left hand tighter. “This hand is green or yes.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“And this one is yellow or no,” Rio continued while squeezing Agatha’s right hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“We’re going to practice. I’m going to ask you questions and you’re going to show me instead of tell me, okay?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha gripped Rio with her left hand and Rio smiled before bringing the hand to her lips and kissing Agatha’s fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Good. Are you feeling okay?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha squeezed with her left hand again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Do you want to keep going?”</p><p>Agatha squeezed with her left three times quickly. She didn’t want to stop.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Okay. We can... I’ll make sure I’m always within reach. When I ask you for a color, left for green and right for yellow. If it’s ever red, don’t stop squeezing with your right hand. Show me you understand.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio said once she felt Agatha’s left hand. “And it’s not just when I ask. If you ever feel yellow, tap or squeeze or get my attention with your right hand. Likewise,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>anytime I’m doing something you like, let me know,” she said while she squeezed Agatha’s green hand again for emphasis.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The softness of the interaction, how Rio took care of her, washed over Agatha. Mirroring Rio’s gesture from a moment ago, Agatha’s left hand brought Rio’s fingers to her lips and kissed her knuckles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha kind of floated in and out and around the fuzzy warm feeling while Rio tied knots around her legs. Similar to the linking knots on her arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’m going to ask that you to flip over and bend your knees and then I’m going to flip you back. It won’t be restrained though, in case you ever need to move or stretch your legs. I don’t want you to have to ask.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha agreed with a soft grip of her hand on Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was nice feeling Rio’s hands on her, guiding her body so Agatha didn’t need to. She felt herself melt a little more once Rio flipped her back and placed her fingers under various knots to test the resistance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“How do you feel?” Rio asked once she finished rechecking the ropes on Agatha’s left leg.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Good,” Agatha answered verbally. “Green.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio curled up next to Agatha with her head using Agatha’s left hip as a pillow. Like a puppy settling in for a nap with her human.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But also a ghost of the restraint she had released from Agatha’s hips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha catches herself wishing she could freeze time and stay in this moment as long as possible. She lets her fingers thread through Rio’s hair to hold her close.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I have a thought… a request,” Rio said while one of her fingers lightly traced lines between some of the knots she’s tied.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“But one, it would require me to break my promise of being within reach. Just for a minute though. And two… as per ground rule number two, I would need your verbal consent.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Well that got Agatha’s attention. She took a deep breath and then exhaled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What are you thinking, babe?” she asked quietly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“How do you feel about me taking a few photos?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened at the thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“It’ll give you time to just exist for a moment… enjoy the feeling,” Rio continued.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha swallowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You think photography counts as kink exploration?” Agatha asked genuinely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I think it falls into the category of exhibitionism, yes. And then, once I’m developing the film in a darkroom, I think it would also count as voyeurism.”</p><p>Fuck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha could literally feel herself dripping.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Also regardless of your ground rules this is something I would want to ask explicit permission.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The way Rio worded that made Agatha curious.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“This… isn’t something you’ve done before?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio shook her head no.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha brushed Rio’s side swept bangs out of her face with her left hand and smiled coyly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Okay. Go get your camera.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio only left the room for a minute or so, but the moment to herself gave Agatha the time to think of a request of her own.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I have an amendment to our agreement,” she told Rio as she came back in the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yes?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You owe me one kiss for each photo you take.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha had been thinking about it since Rio brought it up earlier. And she had also been thinking about the distinct <em>lack</em> of kisses since then.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Okay… if that’s what you want,” Rio agreed. She reached out and held Agatha’s chin with two fingers, leaning in for a kiss. But then she pressed Agatha’s face to the side and her lips landed on Agatha’s temple instead. A cruel reminder of what Agatha had pulled with her earlier.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha’s face was turned away from Rio, so she didn’t see her pick up the camera and frame the shot. But she did hear the click of the shutter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha then felt the bed dip a little as Rio leaned in again. This time her lips landed on Agatha’s exposed neck. Agatha felt her tongue. Then her teeth. Rio took her time on a bite that was sure to leave a mark.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha expected to hear the camera click again, but instead she felt one of Rio’s fingers trace over the spot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“We’re going to let that turn purple,” Rio said quietly.</p><p>She then traced a finger next to one of Agatha’s nipples. They were hard. Dark pink. Begging to be touched.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Click.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s lips on an exposed rib this time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha started to feel fuzzy again. Her limbs felt heavy and light simultaneously. Time seemed to slow down. She moved her right hand up to grasp at the ropes tied around to chest so that she didn’t risk touching Rio with that hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Click.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Another kiss, this time on her torso below her ribs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio then reached and grabbed the teardrop knot between Agatha’s exposed breasts. She pulled, elevating Agatha’s upper body a few inches off the bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Look at me, baby,” Rio commanded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha bit her lower lip at the sound of the pet name and turned her head to lock eyes with Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Click.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio let go and Agatha fell back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Click.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha grabbed Rio with her left hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“That was two,” Agatha whispered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio wrapped her fingers around Agatha’s wrist and pulled Agatha’s hand close enough so that she could kiss her palm. One. Two.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Better,” Agatha said and closed her eyes again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She felt Rio shift and heard the camera from higher up, a different angle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha felt a kiss land on her hip and then felt Rio link two fingers under the middle knot on her left thigh. Rio pulled slowly, spreading Agatha’s legs and leaving her exposed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha heard the shutter click again, followed by the feeling of Rio’s lips between the ropes on her left thigh.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me. This is torture.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Are you not enjoying this?” Rio asked earnestly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You know this isn’t what I meant when I said kiss,” the frustrated tone in Agatha’s voice very apparent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio laughed before she answered with “I’m admiring my work.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You just took a photo of the one spot on my body where there are no ropes.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Oh so you’re saying you got this wet all by yourself?” Rio teased.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha clenched around nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Another click of the shutter, another soft kiss on Agatha’s hip bone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“This is malicious compliance,” Agatha said while laughing. “I didn’t consent to this one. This is a new kink. A blatant disregard of ground rule number two.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio immediately stopped and sat up to look at Agatha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yellow?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha thought about it for a moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Okay. Then I have seven more photos left on this roll.”</p><p>“Seven?!?”</p><p>“Seven.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and gripped the ropes at the top of her thighs. She arched her back and let out an exasperated “Fucckkkk.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Click. Kiss.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Rio, please.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Say it again.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Please, I am begging you.”</p><p>“No… the other part.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha opened her eyes and looked at Rio. Wait… had she really not said her name out loud this whole time? She said it in her head one thousand times since she first said it out loud at the bar. She really never vocalized it since then?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha’s heart shattered a little at the realization.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>But she knew immediately how to rectify this…</p><p>“Please, Rio. I need you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio set the camera down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Rio, I’ve missed you so much.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha watched Rio move and straddle her hips. Hovering above her, not fully touching. Yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No one has ever made me feel like this, Rio.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>With that, Rio grabbed the teardrop knot on Agatha’s chest again, bringing them closer to each other. Almost face to face, but far enough away to maintain eye contact.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Rio, please,” Agatha said one more time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>And then Rio pulled Agatha closer, their lips finally crashing against each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Every nerve in Agatha’s body lit up, like physically reconnecting with Rio this way completed some electrical circuit that had been broken for so long. If Agatha could remember words right now, she’d be thinking about electrical resonance. And mechanical resonance. And acoustic resonance. But all she could think about in that moment was Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She felt Rio bite at her lower lip and then she felt Rio’s tongue against her own. The feeling was overwhelming. Familiar, but new. Safe, but absolutely euphoric.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio pushed Agatha back to lay flat on the bed again, never breaking the kiss. Her hands landed on Agatha’s breasts abruptly, no longer the gentle lingering touch from before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio then moved to reattach her lips to the blossoming bruise on Agatha’s neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Fuck. Rio. This feels so good.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio sinks her teeth into the mark at the same time she roughly twists both of Agatha’s nipples.</p><p>“Rio...” Agatha tried to warn her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio doesn’t stop and Agatha’s not sure if she’ll survive this, feeling her pulse throbbing in her neck under Rio’s mouth. Agatha threads both hands into Rio’s hair and pulls her back into a kiss. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha feels fuzzy and sharp all at the same time. Fuck this isn’t supposed to happen this quickly. But she lets herself surrendered into the feeling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Fuck. Rio. F-fucckkk,” Agatha whispers as her orgasm sends electricity circling through her nerves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio looks at Agatha and bites her own lower lip, little tremors running through her in waves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Rio. Did you just climax to hearing your own name?”</p><p>“No. I climaxed to hearing your voice. Staying my name. While you climaxed. Which is very different.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha let out a giggle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“C’mere babe.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio leaned in to kiss Agatha again, finally settling her hips and body fully against her, triggering another round of little aftershocks in both of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Fuck me again,” Agatha whispered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Technically… I have yet to fuck you a first time. If we’re keeping count.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Rio Vidal, I better feel your mouth on my fucking cunt in the next seven seconds…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio didn’t need to be told twice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha felt Rio move down. Pull on the ropes to drag Agatha’s legs further apart. Settle in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha inhaled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The moment Agatha felt Rio’s tongue, she knew she wasn’t going to last long again. It felt so warm. Surprisingly strong as it parted Agatha’s folds. Slowly traveling from her entrance up… almost to her clit, then pull away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha tried to exhale, but it came out more like a whimper.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio slipped her arms under Agatha’s thighs, shifting Agatha’s hips upward. Agatha then felt Rio’s arms anchor around her hips, clasping onto the ropes at the top of her thighs and pulling Agatha in closer. Her own Rio-shaped hip harness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>That’s when Agatha felt Rio’s tongue dip inside her… while her hands started rocking Agatha’s hips back and forth, effectively making Agatha fuck herself on Rio’s tongue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Oh. My. God. Fuckkkkkk.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha did <em>not</em> last long.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Again, Rio.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>If Agatha could think coherent thoughts right now, she’d realize she’s already come twice without Rio even touching her clit. But Agatha couldn’t think coherent thoughts right now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.” Agatha whispered under her breath, tempo matching how Rio<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>pulled her hips closer. Over and over. The repetition of the movement had Agatha feeling like she was in a trance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Fuck how was Rio so deep? Why does this feel so good? Can this last forever?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha didn’t realize she said those things out loud. But when Rio moaned in response, Agatha felt it everywhere. Nerves sparking with energy. Her body had never felt like this before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio pulled Agatha closer one more time and then held her still. Agatha reached her left hand down to hold Rio’s head in place while she arched her hips up, as much as she could against the confines of the ropes around her legs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha felt herself fall over the edge again, hips moving on their own accord against Rio’s face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>That’s three.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She didn’t even hear herself scream. But she felt the vibration in her throat when she made the sound.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>This time is took her a moment to fully come back to her body. The feeling of Rio lightly kissing the inside of her thigh bringing her back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Again.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She felt Rio smile against her leg before finally finally finally connecting with Agatha’s clit. Lips. Tongue. Teeth. Rio took over and Agatha relaxed into the feeling, letting herself melt into the bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Don’t stop,” Agatha let out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She inhaled and held her breath, just focusing on the things she could feel. The ropes against her skin. Rio’s hair tangled in her fingers. That’s when she consciously realized she could hear how wet Rio had made her. Fuck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Please don’t stop,” she whispered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Instead of feeling the usual building tension that pulled everything tight, Agatha surrendered to the release. Letting the energy radiate out instead of implode in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck… Rio… F-UH-CK.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha always kind of assumed female ejaculation was a myth… Rio just proved her wrong.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“That was so fucking hot,” Rio said, a little out of breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha looked down and grabbed Rio by the fabric of her vest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Why aren’t you naked?” Agatha replied, breath equally as ragged.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha was grateful Rio had decided to leave Agatha’s arms unrestricted. It let her hands reach for the buttons on Rio’s vest.</p><p>“Fucking hypocrite,” Agatha laughed when she realized Rio was also completely bare underneath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Are you complaining though?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha reached up to let her fingers touch an inked vine that wrapped around Rio’s rib cage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No… no, I’m not,” Agatha replied softly, all vitriol lost in her voice. She was so enthralled with uncovering this hidden element of her tattoo… she thought it was just a half sleeve of vining leaves on each arm. But more leaves were secretly hidden under the armor of Rio’s vest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Take it off, please,” Agatha pleaded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio sat back, letting the vest fall off her shoulders and then tossed it onto the pile on the chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“These too, please,” Agatha tapped on Rio’s dark wash jeans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio stood. Undid her belt. Released the top button. Slide the zipper down. And exposed herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha’s breath became even more ragged.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’re so fucking hot, babe,” Agatha managed. Unintentionally echoing Rio’s words. Apparently they were the only words rattling around in her head at the moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio raised one foot to the bed frame, unlacing and removing her boot. Then switched legs and did the same to the other. She let her slouchy jeans slide down her legs and she turned momentarily to toss them toward the pile as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>That’s when Agatha audibly gasped, seeing the inked leaves covering the expanse of Rio’s entire upper back from shoulders to torso.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Vines permanently marked into Rio’s skin, unrooted but stemming from her shoulder blades… simultaneously falling down her back and twisting up and around her arms… encasing her rib cage… a chest harness she gets to secretly wear under the armor of her clothes. Every day. And Agatha has the privilege it see it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Rio, I need you inside me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha watched as Rio wrapped her long fingers around the base of the dildo secured in the o ring of her strap.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Please.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio took a step forward and Agatha instinctively spread her legs wider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She felt her pulse start racing again as Rio joined her on the bed and positioned herself in the space Agatha made.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>With her hand still holding onto her own length, Rio moved it a little. Letting the tip tap softly against Agatha’s clit repeatedly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Don’t tease me, I need you.”</p><p>And then Rio adjusted her grip a little lower and forced the tip to slide up and down Agatha’s wet folds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha looked down mesmerized. The silicone glistening with the evidence of her desire. She bit her lower lip to try to contain a moan… unsuccessfully. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’re so cute when you’re desperate,” Rio spoke softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha felt Rio press against her entrance gently and hold herself in place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“And so wet. You don’t even need any lube… do you need my fingers first or are you ready to take me raw?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha whimpered and reached out to pull Rio closer by one of the buckles holding the strap in place around her hip. With her left hand, of course.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’ll take that as a yes, you’re ready for me,” Rio said before pushing herself in a little deeper.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Deeper, but… not enough.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The pitch of Agatha’s moan was something neither of them had heard before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Does it feel good babe? I want to make sure you feel good before I give you everything.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha wasn’t used to Rio being so vocal in bed. But she now understands the appeal of a woman being vocal about what she wants.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Please, I need more… it feels so good,” Agatha whimpered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio pushed in closer, slowly letting herself get swallowed by Agatha’s weeping cunt.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha feels acutely aware of how the leather and metal press into her skin since there’s no rope restraining her hips. She could also feel herself pulsing around Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Tell me how it feels now.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Deep… thick… hard…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“And how do you feel?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Full. I feel so full. I need more… please.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands had attached themselves to Rio’s inked ribs. It gave Rio space to put her forearms on the bed next to Agatha’s head, holding up her weight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio started to roll her hips, slowly moving inside Agatha. The sound of the small movements echoing in the quiet room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Can you come like this?” Rio asked softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yea just don’t stop.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Can I kiss you again?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha answered by pulling Rio closer and reaching up a little to find her lips. She closed her eyes and fell deeper into the haze that surrounded her. She moaned into the kiss when she felt Rio’s tongue. And she felt her body tremor a little at the sensation of Rio’s hard nipples brushing back and forth against her own. It made her aware of all the knots running down her arms and securing her legs, little pressure points keeping her contained.</p><p>Rio kept her pace, slowly fucking Agatha. The consistent pace both soothing and frustrating at the same time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha needed air. She pulled away a little to gasp, filling her lungs with oxygen and letting it seep into her bloodstream.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’m so close, Rio,” Agatha whispered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>When she felt Rio press a soft kiss to the bruise on her neck, everything fell apart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The way she moaned Rio’s name while her orgasm crashed over her clearly affected Rio, who finally let her body fully sink closer into Agatha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha shuttered under the grounding force of Rio. She wrapped her arms around Rio’s torso, pressing her palms flat against her back. Able to feel the energy pulsing between them tingle against her hands. While also feeling herself pulsing around Rio. Resonant.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Please don’t stop, Rio. I know you’re close. Don’t stop, baby.”</p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s hips pick up pace, pressing deeper and harder now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“It feels so good. You feel so good, Rio….<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>I need you. I need this so bad.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Fuck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Please, yes that’s it…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>I want to feel you come while you’re inside me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>I want to feel full…</p><p>Please, Rio, make me feel full.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha will never forget the sound of how Rio moaned her name when she released. Or the feeling of their heart rates syncing up in the moments after.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Can you go again, pretty boy?” Agatha asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio’s brow tensed and she bite her lower lip, nodding her head and then settling her forehead against Agatha’s shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure what she liked better, the sharp feeling of the rope against her skin or the soft feeling of Rio when she settled the weight of her head somewhere on Agatha’s body. Anywhere. But feeling both felt right.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Harder, Rio I can take it… I need to feel you deeper.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha was surprised to feel Rio’s fingers slip under the ropes just above the knot on her chest. She pressed her palms flat on Agatha, using her as leverage to thrust her own hips more forcefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Fuck, baby your cock feels so good inside me. You’re so deep… I feel you everywhere. I love that I make you so hard. I love that you make me feel so good. No one else knows how to fuck me the way I need it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’m close… fuck…” Rio says, her voice low and strained. Her eyes closed and her lips pressed tight together after letting the admission slip out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Rio, look at me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio opened her eyes and found Agatha’s gaze.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“There you are… I see you, babe,” Agatha whispered. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio whimpered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“So cute when you’re about to come inside me, handsome.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>That might have broke Rio in that moment. The way her body froze and then fell apart, shuttering in waves, was beautiful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was also fucking hot and caused Agatha to fall right back over the edge again with her.</p><p>Rio let her body collapse, falling into Agatha’s embrace. Agatha knew Rio needed a moment to recover. So she let her finger tips gently trace the groove of Rio’s spine under the vines.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It gave Agatha the time to land back her her body as well. Notice her own breath. Enjoy the ache. Commit the feeling of Rio’s ropes against her skin to memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha wasn’t certain, but she also thought she felt tears on her shoulder where Rio had rested her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Color?” Agatha asked quietly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Green,” Rio said softly with an exhale.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha just held Rio close for a while. Feeling grounded. Secure. Comfortably full.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Eventually she felt Rio stir.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Okay I need to get you out of these ropes. You’ve been tied up way longer than I usually let people be on their first time.”</p><p>The abruptness of the statement and all its the implications hit Agatha in her gut.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Oh… okay, yea.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha suddenly felt overheated. A little queasy. Acutely aware of how loudly her heart was beating.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio must have been attuned to the shift in Agatha’s tone and course-corrected.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha could feel Rio’s chest expand against her own when Rio took a deep breathe. Did Rio always do this with people? The quiet intimacy of just co-existing. It made her stomach feel sour.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio placed a gentle kiss on Agatha’s temple and brushed a piece of her wild hair off her face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I just want to keep you safe, baby. I didn’t mean anything by it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“It… it’s okay… I think,” Agatha stuttered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No it’s not.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s chest press against her again. She also felt numb inside all the ties wrapped around her body. Existing at all feeling hard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What do you need from me right now? How can I make you feel better?” Rio said, a warm confidence back in her voice when she whispered it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha thought about it for a moment, checking in with herself to figure out the answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I liked that tapping thing you did earlier…that helped.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio traced her fingers along Agatha’s cheekbones and then started tapping lightly. When Agatha’s breath slowed down and her heart rate stabilized a little, Rio slide her hands down and repeated the same thing on Agatha’s collarbones. Lightly tracing the bones several times and then resuming the taps right next to where the ropes crossed over the bones.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha’s thoughts and body drifted back into the warm safe feeling that was starting to feeling familiar.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Thank you,” she whispered. “It’s helping.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio then kissed Agatha’s sternum, just below where her collarbones met and just above the teardrop knot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha shivered and clenched around Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Are you ready? For me to pull out?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“If you must,” Agatha said quietly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio adjusted and reached down to gently guide herself out. And then unbuckled the side of her strap on to take it off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha wrapped her arms around her own chest, linking her fingers under the ropes with one hand and tracing the pattern of the teardrop knot with the other.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio started untying the knots in reverse order, starting with her legs and then her arms. Agatha still clinging to the knot on her chest with alternating hands as Rio tended to one arm and then the other.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You like this?” Rio asked while touching the chest harness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha nodded her head quietly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I have some macrame rope. It’s cotton. Thinner cord. So it’s softer and smaller. Any time you want, I can tie one up quick. We can try different designs. Decorative. Like something you could wear under your clothes. Not for play, just for…”</p><p>Security? Agatha’s brain offered when Rio trailed off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’d like that,” are the words she said out loud though.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio started doing her preliminary check for any bruises or rope burn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“How do you feel?” she asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Good. Green.” Agatha answered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio kissed her cheek and collected her accessories to go clean them. She returned with a warm wet washcloth and bruise balm. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Was it like you imagined?” Rio asked curiously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Better.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio didn’t push any further, happy with the extent of the debrief for now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>After she finished checking over Agatha’s body again with the washcloth, she opened the little container of balm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>When Agatha inhaled she could smell the scent of arnica and shea butter. It felt comforting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio dipped her finger in and smeared a little bit on the mark on Agatha’s neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha didn’t realize she was frowning until Rio told her she’s make another mark once this one started to fade.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Still feeling okay?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hmm yes,” Agatha hummed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Are you good for me to go make you tea?” Rio asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Water is okay. But I do need a snack.”</p><p>“Salty or sweet?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Sweet please. Just something small.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio then collected the rope and put it away. She walked past the stereo on her dresser and pressed play, starting up a cassette that was already in place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Of course the first song was Rhiannnon. Agatha closed her eyes and listened.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><blockquote><p>“Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night</p><p>And wouldn't you love to love her?</p><p>Takes to the sky like a bird in flight</p><p>And who will be her lover?</p><p>All your life you've never seen</p><p>A woman taken by the wind</p><p>Would you stay if she promised you heaven?</p><p>Will you ever win?</p><p>She is like a cat in the dark</p><p>And then she is the darkness…”</p></blockquote><p>When Rio returned, she had a little dollop of something creamy on her middle finger.</p><p>“Open up, babe,” she commanded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped without a thought. She felt Rio’s finger on her tongue and then scrap against her lower teeth. Rio then tapped Agatha’s lips with that finger.</p><p>“Close… let it melt… swallow.”</p><p>Agatha felt fuzzy again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“That was cruel.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I thought you liked sunflower honey?”</p><p>“I do. I just don’t like that the first time I felt your fingers inside me in three years was a tease.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio laughed and fell in bed, pulling Agatha into a cuddle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Would you ever consider being art?” Agatha asked while tracing the ink of a vine on Rio’s left shoulder, down to the leaf that landed just above her heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“And risk damaging my tattoos?”</p><p>“I can avoid them. You’d look so pretty with my ropes crisscrossing your skin,” Agatha replied.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“If you wanna tie me up… you can,” Rio said a little flustered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yes. But not tonight, we need to sleep soon.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha pouted and Rio laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>When she heard the song change, Agatha froze. She took a deep breath and let the lyrics wash over her.</p><p>This time when the tears started to well in her eyes, she felt them spill over and run down her face. They mirrored the ones on Rio’s cheeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><blockquote><p>“Time casts a spell on you</p><p>but you won't forget me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>I know I could have loved you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>but you would not let me.”</p></blockquote><p>“I can’t believe you put this song on your mixed tape for a play date with a stranger,” Agatha commented.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“The theme is obviously Stevie Nicks songs, babe.”</p><p>“Okay but… Silver Springs?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yea. Well. Maybe I’m a masochist.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha reached up to touch Rio’s face and bring her gaze down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha sang the words to Rio quietly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I'll follow you down 'til the sound of my voice will haunt you… give me just a chance. You will never get away from the sound of the woman that loves you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio swallowed and pressed a kiss to Agatha’s temple.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Is it crazy to say I love you right now?” Agatha asked. “After only a few hours.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I never stopped loving you,” Rio replied confidently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The world might as well have stopped spinning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha blinked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Even after three years?”</p><p>“Agatha, I would love you for three hundred. Even if I never saw you again.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha’s lower lip quivered. Her jaw tightened. She shoulders shook. The sound of the sob she let out was haunting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio wrapped her arms around her, pressing Agatha to her chest. Hands solidly on Agatha’s back so she felt secure, letting her cry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Eventually Agatha’s breath slowed and she was able to exist in the room again and not just in her feelings. Until she heard the first few chords of Gold Dust Woman.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>When Agatha told Rio that this was her favorite song, she hadn’t consciously realized it was because the lyrics reminded her of Rio. Or maybe… they hadn’t yet?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><blockquote><p>“Well, did she make you cry</p><p>Make you break down</p><p>Shatter your illusions of love?</p><p>And is it over now, do you know how?</p><p>To pick up the pieces and go home…”</p></blockquote><p>Agatha started crying again. It felt cathartic. Like a heaviness that had lived in her chest for three years was finally melting away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha said quietly when she could catch her breath.</p><p>“Don’t ever apologize for feeling your feelings. I like seeing you be vulnerable. It’s… different. Than before.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha was overwhelmed with the desire to kiss Rio. She let herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio kissed her back and it started to get heated before Rio pulled back and smiled softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Agatha, we need to sleep.”</p><p>“But I haven’t touched you yet.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Tomorrow. We need sleep.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Rio, you know I love morning sex but you sleep in sooooo late. Don’t make me wait.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Wake me up then.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“But you sleep like the dead.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Try harder.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha didn’t reply immediately.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Or are you not up for the challenge?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Agatha looked at Rio with a sparkle in her eyes.</p><p>If anyone could pull Rio from the dead of sleep and back into her corporal form, it’s Agatha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
