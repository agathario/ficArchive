<p>Rio had never been lucky. If she bought a lottery ticket, the universe would hand-deliver the winning numbers to someone else. If she ordered food, they’d forget the sauce. She always picked the slowest checkout line, and if there was one chair with gum on it, her butt would find it.</p><p>If a celebrity was going to accidentally add the wrong person on Snapchat, it should have been someone cooler, someone who didn’t still trip over their own shoelaces. But one fateful Tuesday evening, luck finally threw her a bone in the form of an accidental Snapchat add.</p><p>Here she was, staring at her phone screen in absolute disbelief.</p><p>Agatha Harkness has added you as a friend.</p><p>Agatha. Harkness.</p><p>Oscar-winner. Red carpet queen. The internet’s favorite “MOTHER” ever since she’d played that now-iconic villain role in Coven of Chaos. The woman who had millions of fans dissecting every smirk, every arched brow, every moment of effortless, knee-weakening charisma.</p><p>And she had accidentally added Rio on Snapchat.</p><p>"Yeah, right," Rio snorted. Probably a fan account. Or worse, a scam trying to trick her and steal her personal data. Still, curiosity got the best of her, and she clicked accept, looking at the stories of the account,</p><p>A mirror selfie of Agatha, but—wait. She was wearing glasses? Thick-rimmed, librarian-chic glasses.</p><p>Rio nearly dropped her phone. Agatha Harkness, the all-powerful, all-mysterious, perfectly put-together actress, wore glasses? This was not a publicly available photo. In public, she was all smoky eyes and confident smirks, but here she was, dressed in an oversized sweater, looking like she was about to grade papers.</p><p>It had to be a mistake. A glitch in the celebrity social media matrix.Agatha had obviously meant to add someone else—her friends or a family member? A fellow A-lister who also had cheekbones so sharp they could cut glass?</p><p>But before Rio could even process what was happening, a new Snap notification popped up to say she’d added to her story.</p><p>The first image was... onions.</p><p>A cutting board covered in onions, to be exact, with a caption that read: Crying over these like they’re a failed audition.</p><p>Rio frowned. This was not the type of content she expected from Hollywood’s reigning queen of elegance and mystery.</p><p>Then another post.</p><p>It was Agatha. Wearing glasses again.</p><p>Slightly askew, adorably dorky glasses. Not the kind Rio would expect to see on a woman whose mere existence had set the internet ablaze more than once. Her usually perfect hair was pulled into a haphazard bun, and she wore an oversized sweatshirt with just noticeable coffee stains on the collar.</p><p>Rio nearly choked on her own spit.</p><p>This wasn’t the Agatha Harkness who made dramatic entrances at film premieres, draped in couture and bathed in golden light. This was Agatha Harkness: Relatable Mess.</p><p>Another post. This time, a video.</p><p>Agatha leaned against a kitchen counter, lazily twirling a wooden spoon between her fingers. “Alright, idiots,” she said, in a voice that was somehow both exhausted and charming, “tonight’s culinary disaster is lasagna. Which I just realized I forgot to preheat the oven for. So this is going great.”</p><p>The camera tilted downward, revealing a baking dish that had been carefully prepped… and was now sitting, very uselessly, on the countertop.</p><p>Agatha sighed dramatically, adjusting her glasses with the back of her wrist. “Why am I like this?”</p><p>Rio clapped a hand over her mouth to muffle the very undignified noise that almost escaped. Removed it and then clapped a hand over her mouth again to stop herself from squealing. This was not the Agatha Harkness the world knew and loved. And it was, hands down, the best thing Rio had ever witnessed.</p><p>She knew she should remove herself from this account. She knew Agatha probably meant to add someone else.</p><p>But then—one more post appeared.</p><p>A mirror selfie. Agatha, still in her glasses, balancing a glass of wine in one hand and flashing a tired but triumphant grin. ‘Forgot to preheat the oven. But found a frozen backup lasagna in the freezer. Manifesting works’.</p><p>Rio exhaled, pressing her phone to her chest.</p><p>She was never removing herself from this account.</p><p>Rio set her phone down. Then immediately picked it back up.</p><p>Then set it down again, like that would somehow stop her from being a creep.</p><p>Her brain was screaming at her: This was an accident. Agatha Harkness did not mean to add you. You are not supposed to be here.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>She opened Snapchat again. The account had no fancy verification badge, no obvious connection to Agatha’s official socials. Just the username ‘itsactuallyagatha’, which felt suspiciously casual for a woman who had walked the Met Gala carpet in a sculpted couture gown that made her look like a living Renaissance painting.</p><p>Rio chewed her lip.</p><p>She switched apps and searched Agatha Harkness Instagram.</p><p>The first result? Her verified public account, boasting an obscene number of followers.  180 million followers.</p><p>Every post was a work of art. Professionally lit photoshoots. Elegant behind-the-scenes shots. Red carpet close-ups where she looked like she’d been carved from the dreams of mortals. Even the candid pictures had an effortless aesthetic, like she had simply woken up bathed in golden sunlight and draped in a silk robe.</p><p>And yet, nowhere on this perfectly curated Instagram was there a single mention of glasses, messy buns, or lasagna-based existential crises.</p><p>Rio scrolled through the comments on Agatha’s latest post, a picture from some Vogue spread where she was wearing a suit that should be illegal.</p><p>- Mother<br/>
- Step on me<br/>
- She literally invented cheekbones<br/>
- I bet she smells like expensive wine and ambition</p><p>Okay, none of these people would believe that just five minutes ago, Agatha Harkness had been filming herself in a kitchen, dramatically lamenting the lack of oven preheating.</p><p>Rio switched back to Snapchat, her heart thumping. This wasn’t just an alternate account. This was a secret account. A close friends account.</p><p>Agatha Harkness—the Agatha Harkness—had accidentally let Rio into a digital inner circle that the rest of the world would kill to see.</p><p>She swallowed hard.</p><p>She should do the right thing. She really really should remove herself before Agatha realized her mistake.</p><p>But then, another snap appeared.</p><p>A blurry, close-up shot of Agatha’s own face, taken at an aggressively unflattering angle, captioned: This is what failure looks like.</p><p>Rio lost the battle. She had to stay.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The following few days were silent with no new snap updates from Agatha.</p><p>Rio told herself this was for the best. Agatha had probably realised her mistake and blocked her, or more likely, she’d simply gotten busy with something far more glamorous than Snapchat. Maybe she was filming a movie, attending an exclusive party, or, Rio swallowed, quietly removing Rio from the account.</p><p>That would be fair. That would be expected. That would also be devastating. By day three, Rio had almost convinced herself to let it go. Almost.</p><p>Then, late in the afternoon, her phone exploded with notifications.</p><p>Snap chat notification. Snapchat notification. Snapchat notification.</p><p>She grabbed her phone and nearly dropped it in her hurry to open the app. The first image was pure chaos.</p><p>Agatha, mid-sprint, her usually sleek, untouchable composure utterly destroyed by the fact that she was currently covered in mud. Her face was streaked with it. Her expensive-looking hoodie, once white, now a tragic brown, looked like she’d lost a fight with nature itself.</p><p>The caption? I’m living in HELL</p><p>Rio, already choking on laughter, tapped to the next post.</p><p>A video. Agatha, panting, breathless, holding up her phone with one hand while the other pointed wildly toward a distant, blurry shape in the background.</p><p>“Do you see that?” she gasped. “That little blurry menace? That’s MY dog. That’s MY DOG who has been ignoring me for the last fifteen minutes.”</p><p>Rio squinted. In the distance, a large breed dog, a greyhound, maybe?—was joyfully prancing across a massive field, completely unbothered by Agatha’s suffering.</p><p>“Look at her,” Agatha wheezed, flipping the camera back to her own mud-streaked face. “She’s ruined me. My dignity is GONE.”</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A blurry picture of the dog mid-leap, paws coated in mud, soaring toward Agatha.</p><p>Caption: I’m under ATTACK</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>Agatha, now on the ground, face-down in the mud, one hand stretched toward her phone like a fallen soldier.</p><p>Caption: Tell my story and my family I love them</p><p>Rio was shaking with laughter. She had tears in her eyes.</p><p>This was not the Agatha Harkness the world knew. This was not the confident, dangerously cool Hollywood goddess who had the world wrapped around her finger. This was a human disaster getting tackled by a seventy five-pound dog.</p><p>And Rio never wanted to leave this secret world.</p><p>Over the next few hours, Agatha continued to document her downfall in real time.</p><p>The snaps came in a relentless, hilarious flurry.</p><p>A video: Agatha, now sitting in the mud, legs stretched out in the puddles, completely resigned to her fate. Her dog, whose name Rio learned, was Remi, sat proudly beside her, tongue hanging out, completely unbothered by the destruction she’d caused.</p><p>“She has no remorse," Agatha announced, staring into the camera like she was filming a war documentary. “None. I could perish in this field, and she’d just roll on my remains."</p><p>Remi immediately flopped onto her back, wiggling around in the mud like she was making a snow angel, wagging tail sending flurries of mud into the air.</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A zoomed-in photo of Remi, looking almost clean, somehow having shaken off all the mud in a feat of physics-defying trickery except for her feet and the bottom of her legs.</p><p>Caption: HOW</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A selfie of Agatha back in her car, still filthy, her hair a birds nest of a crime scene, looking personally victimised by existence itself.</p><p>Caption: Guess who just tracked mud into a luxury vehicle? That’s right. It’s me</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>The aftermath. Agatha’s pristine, high-end G Class SUV, absolutely wrecked. Mud splatters everywhere. Paw prints on the dashboard and all of the seating. Remi sitting smugly in the passenger seat on top of a designer cashmere scarf that Agatha had clearly sacrificed in a moment of desperation if containing the mud.</p><p>Caption: This was a $500 scarf. I’ve accepted my fate</p><p>Rio was howling.</p><p>The fact that the internet had no idea this was happening made it infinitely funnier. If people saw Agatha at an awards show tonight, looking immaculate in a custom gown, they would never know that just hours before, she had been defeated by her own dog and some wet dirt.</p><p>Hours later, unexpectedly, the Snaps shifted.</p><p>It started with a blurry  photo of Agatha’s bare feet kicked up on what looked like a couch, a half-eaten takeout container of pasta in the foreground.</p><p>No caption. Just casual. Unpolished. Unbelievably normal.</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A dimly lit kitchen counter. An open bottle of wine, a glass half-full. A script, pages slightly crumpled, a highlighter and pen resting on top.</p><p>Caption: Learning lines. Send thoughts and prayers</p><p>Rio blinked. She had never, in all her time lurking on Agatha’s public socials, seen any behind-the-scenes glimpses like this. Every post on her Instagram was calculated, photoshoots, promotions, carefully worded captions. But this? This was real.</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A cozy, messy  room. Blankets thrown over the couch. Books everywhere, on the coffee table, stacked on the floor, one half-open like she’d been reading and forgotten about it. A fluffy rabbit curled up against the armrest, staring at the camera like it had just been woken up. Rio’s brain short-circuited.</p><p>Agatha Harkness had a rabbit? No one knew Agatha Harkness had a rabbit.</p><p>Caption: Before you say it—yes, I’m have both a greyhound dog and a rabbit. I contain multitudes. And no, Remi doesn’t want to kill him</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A close-up of a handwritten letter, elegant cursive filling the page. The signature at the bottom? Agatha’s.</p><p>Caption: Writing thank-you notes like it’s 1823. My mama raised me right.</p><p>Rio exhaled. It wasn’t just funny anymore. It wasn’t just entertaining. She was seeing parts of Agatha’s life that no one else in the general public did.</p><p>Not the actress. Not the persona. Just…Agatha. And that? That was dangerously fascinating.</p>

<p>Rio had never been the type to obsess over celebrities. Sure, she had favorite actors and actresses, and yes, she had definitely rewatched multiple scenes from Coven of Chaos more times than she’d admit, but she’d never been the kind of person to actively check a famous person’s social media every day.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>It had been a few days since Agatha’s last post, and Rio was embarrassingly aware of how often she was checking Snapchat for an update. She wasn’t proud of it, but she’d developed a routine, open the app first thing in the morning, casually scroll through, pretend she wasn’t looking for anything specific, then close it, rinse and repeat in the evening, and tell herself she was being normal. She was failing miserably at being normal.</p><p>Then, that Sunday evening, her phone exploded with notifications.</p><p>Snapchat notifications. Agatha Harkness has posted a story.</p><p>Rio clicked faster than she’d like to admit.</p><p>The first Snap was simple: a black-and-white photo of a woman, clearly taken years ago. She had an oval face, kind, gentle eyes, and a soft smile.</p><p>Caption: Happy Mother’s Day, Mama!</p><p>Rio frowned. She had never heard Agatha’s mother mentioned before. No interviews, no red carpet questions, nothing.</p><p>The next Snap was a grainy, candid photo—Agatha, much younger, maybe in her late teens, sitting on a kitchen counter while the same woman stirred something on the stove.</p><p>Caption: She let me sit on the counter until I was like, 22. Then she told me to act my age</p><p>Rio smiled, but there was a tug of something deeper in her chest.</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A video. Agatha, lying on a couch, hair a mess, no makeup, wrapped in a hoodie that looked too big. Her voice was softer than usual when she spoke.</p><p>“I don’t talk about my mom in public. Not because I don’t want to, but because—" She paused, rubbing a hand over her face as she yawned wide. "I don’t want her to have to deal with all the attention.”</p><p>The camera tilted toward the ceiling.</p><p>"Lilia is… a force of nature. The kind of person who refuses to give you a clear explanation to anything. I asked so many questions as a kid, and she’d just laugh and say, ‘Figure it out, Agatha.’"</p><p>Another pause.</p><p>“My mom adopting me was probably the best thing that ever happened to me.”</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A blurry childhood photo, Agatha, maybe eight, sitting on a porch step, grinning wide, missing a front tooth. Her mom, Lilia, sat beside her, arm slung around her casually, like they had always been mother and daughter.</p><p>Caption:She has never treated me like I was anything but hers.</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A new photo. Lilia, now, standing in a sunlit kitchen, stirring something on the stove. She was mid-laugh, eyes crinkled, curly grey brown hair in a bun on top of her head, the same warmth from the old pictures still there.</p><p>Caption: Still won’t tell me her sauce recipe</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>An old note, yellowed with age, Lilia’s handwriting scrawled across the paper.<br/>
‘You don’t have to look like me to be mine. You always were and are.’</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A final photo. Agatha and Lilia together, taken that day, sitting on a porch, coffee mugs in hand. Agatha was leaning against her, eyes half-closed, comfortable. Lilia’s arm was around her, like it had always been.</p><p>Caption: Happy Mother’s Day to the best</p><p>Rio swallowed again, this was too personal, it wasn’t in the public domain that Agatha was adopted.</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A glass of wine. A large TV screen in the background.</p><p>Caption: Anyway, that’s enough feelings for today. Time to drink and rewatch trash TV</p><p>The next Snap was a screenshot of a truly awful reality dating show, with Agatha’s caption screaming: WHY WOULD YOU PROPOSE AFTER THREE WEEKS??</p><p>Rio huffed out a laugh, even as her chest felt unreasonably tight. Because damn. She hadn’t expected to learn such personal things about Agatha today. And somehow, she felt like she knew her better than ever.</p><p>The next morning, Rio woke up to a further notifications.</p><p>Agatha Harkness has posted a story - the alert she’d set up for Agathas posts doing its job.</p><p>Her heart did that stupid little jolt of excitement before she could stop it. She swiped open Snapchat, fully expecting a hungover rant about the reality show from last night.</p><p>Instead she’d posted a video. But this time, it wasn’t filmed by Agatha. It was shaky, blurry and accompanied by the very familiar, very grumpy voice of none other than Bucky Barnes.</p><p>Rio almost dropped her phone. Bucky. Barnes. As in Hollywood’s golden boy. The critically acclaimed, painfully good looking, painfully talented leading man who had been in at least three Oscar-winning films.</p><p>And apparently, Agatha had dragged him on a hike before sunrise.</p><p>"It is half past four. IN THE MORNING." Buckys voice was thick with exhaustion and betrayal as the camera shook violently, trying to focus on Agatha ahead of him on the trail. “I want it on record that I did NOT agree to this."</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>Agatha, far too awake, standing at the edge of a trail with a thermos of coffee in one hand and a deeply smug expression on her face.</p><p>Caption (clearly written by Bucky): This woman is a MONSTER (and yes shes distracting me with her phone like I’m her toddler)</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A selfie, Bucky in the foreground, wrapped in a hoodie, looking like he wanted to die, while Agatha stood behind him, grinning like an absolute menace, holding up a granola bar like it was a trophy.</p><p>Caption: It’ll be fun, Bucky! The sunrise will be worth it, Bucky! I am LITERALLY suffering</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A video, Bucky flipping the camera to show the sunrise, which, okay, was actually gorgeous, the sky painted in shades of pink and gold over the hills.</p><p>Then the camera swung back around to Agatha, who was sipping her coffee like she had just conquered the world.</p><p>“I told you it’d be worth it," she said, obnoxiously pleased with herself.</p><p>“I hope a bear eats you," Bucky muttered.</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>An aggressively zoomed-in shot of Buckys absolutely dead inside expression.</p><p>Caption (Which Rio thought was Agatha writing it this time): Nature is healing</p><p>Another post. Another video, Bucky panting, practically keeled over, hands on his knees.</p><p>“We are” he wheezed, “two miles from the car. Two miles. And I have no energy left to live."</p><p>From behind the camera, Agatha could be heard cackling. “You’re a literal action star. You do fight scenes and chase sequences for a living."</p><p>“WITH STUNT DOUBLES, YOU MENACE."</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A final photo, Agatha and Bucky, both sitting on a rock, looking exhausted but weirdly peaceful, sipping coffee and staring at the sky.</p><p>Caption: He’ll never admit it, but he liked it</p><p>Buckys comment, added in tiny text at the bottom where he’d taken her phone back before posting: LIES AND SLANDER</p><p>Rio grinned so hard her face hurt. So.</p><p>Agatha Harkness and Bucky weren’t just co-stars in multiple movies, they were actual friends. Possibly best friends. Or a couple as a lot of people wished them to be? And the internet had no idea.</p>

<p>Another few days passed with no further stories posted by Agatha.</p><p>Rio told herself she wasn’t waiting for anything. She had a life. She had responsibilities. She was a normal person who did normal things, not someone who was unreasonably invested in the secret Snapchat life of an A-list actress. And then the notifications hit. She was totally invested.</p><p>Agatha Harkness has posted a story.</p><p>Her heart leapt as she tapped into Agatha’s snap story.</p><p>A dimly lit bar. Half-empty glasses of whiskey scattered across the table. A terrible cocktail napkin doodle of what looked like Agatha and Bucky, except stick figures with aggressively dramatic cheekbones.</p><p>Caption: Welcome to chaotic gay drinks night</p><p>Another Snap</p><p>A video. Agatha and Bucky sitting in a booth, laugh-crying, both clearly tipsy.</p><p>*"I’m just saying—" Agatha wheezed, wiping a tear from her eye, “we could have solved so many problems years ago if people had just realised we were both gay."</p><p>“RIGHT?!" Bucky shouted, dramatically throwing his hands in the air. “Do you understand how many tabloids tried to make us a thing?"</p><p>“That one article, what was it called?”Agatha snapped her fingers, thinking.</p><p>“Are They or Aren’t They: Hollywood’s Most Will-They-Won’t-They?’" Bucky said dramatically, flipping an invisible scarf over his shoulder.</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A screenshot of an old tabloid article featuring a staged red carpet photo of Agatha and Bucky, standing way too close, both smirking like they had a secret.</p><p>Caption: Cutest couple lol</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A video, Agatha dramatically reading from her phone.</p><p>“Sources say Bucky Barnes and Agatha Harkness have undeniable chemistry”</p><p>“I mean, yeah," Bucky interrupted, shrugging. “Gay people have chemistry."</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A selfie, Agatha and Bucky, leaning against each other, looking smug as hell.</p><p>Caption: Plot twist: we’re in love with each other</p><p>Rio put her phone down. Then picked it back up immediately because what the hell.</p><p>Agatha Harkness and Bucky Barnes, two of the most relentlessly shipped people in Hollywood, two people the internet had spent YEARS analysing, making fan edits of, writing articles about— Were both gay.</p><p>And no one knew. Except, apparently, her. Rio was reeling. She sat there, staring at her phone, processing.</p><p>Because listen, she had always found Agatha attractive. It wasn’t exactly a secret, not even to herself. You didn’t have to be in love with someone to recognize that they were alarmingly gorgeous. But this? This changed everything.</p><p>Because before, Agatha Harkness had been unattainable. A distant, untouchable Hollywood goddess. Beautiful, yes. Charming, obviously. But straight, or at the very least, unavailable in a way that made Rio’s occasional daydreams about her purely theoretical.</p><p>But now?</p><p>Now she had confirmed, on Snapchat, with her own mouth, that she was into women.</p><p>And Rio? Rio was a woman. Oh no. She flopped back onto her bed, groaning into a pillow.</p><p>Her phone buzzed with another notification. Agatha had posted again.</p><p>Rio scrambled to open it. It was a video, still filmed at the bar. This time, Agatha and Bucky were half-drunk, aggressively debating something.</p><p>“Okay, but hear me out,” Bucky was saying, swirling his whiskey, “you could totally pull off dating a woman publicly. People would lose their minds."</p><p>“Oh, please," Agatha scoffed, taking a sip of her drink. “Like that wouldn’t be an absolute disaster."</p><p>“How would it be a disaster?"</p><p>“Because, dear Bucky," Agatha said, leaning in dramatically, "the second I go public with a woman, suddenly I’m the Internet’s 'Lesbian Mommy' and people start writing think pieces about how I personally invented being gay."</p><p>“Agatha," Bucky said solemnly, “I have bad news for you."</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A screenshot of a tweet from some random user: Agatha Harkness could breathe near a woman, and I’d thank her for her service. Step on me, Mother</p><p>Caption: SEE? PROOF</p><p>Rio wheezed. Because okay, yes, she had seen the Internet lose its collective mind over Agatha before. And maybe she had even contributed to the chaos once or twice (or a hundred times).</p><p>But now? Now she was here. In the secret inner circle. Watching Agatha talk about dating like it was a real possibility. Which meant Rio was going to die. Because she had gone from casually thinking Agatha Harkness was hot to knowing too much.</p><p>And worse? Now she fancied her even more.</p><p>The days that followed were hell for Rio’s sanity.</p><p>Because now, every time Agatha posted, Rio wasn’t just casually entertained, she was actively suffering. It was one thing to find a celebrity attractive when they were a distant, untouchable concept, but now?</p><p>Now, she was getting regular, unfiltered access to Agatha Harkness in her natural habitat. And it was ruining her life.</p><p>Another Snap. A video, Agatha sitting on the floor of her closet, dramatically sighing, surrounded by piles of clothes.</p><p>“I don’t want to get dressed. I want to wear pajamas to this meeting."</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A mirror selfie, Agatha in an oversized hoodie and leggings, hair in a messy bun, no makeup, looking unfairly gorgeous for someone who had just been whining about fashion emergencies.</p><p>Caption: I am a fraud. This is literally just expensive loungewear.</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A photo of her fridge, completely barren except for a bottle of champagne, some oat milk, and several different types of fancy cheese.</p><p>Caption: This is why I keep eating dinner at Buckys</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A video, Agatha sitting at her kitchen counter, eating takeout straight from the container, glasses perched on the end of her nose as she scrolled through her phone.</p><p>“Someone just called me 'mysterious' in an article," she mumbled, mouth full of noodles. “Honey, I just spent twenty minutes Googling 'why does my dog eat grass' like a confused suburban mom."</p><p>Rio was obsessed with this woman.</p><p>Another Snap. A bath snap.</p><p>Rio wasn’t ready.</p><p>It wasn’t explicit, but it was dangerous in a way that felt personal.</p><p>A steamy, dimly lit bathroom. A full wine glass balanced on the edge of a massive clawfoot tub. Agatha’s bare knee, just barely visible through the water.</p><p>Caption: This is what I deserve after today</p><p>Rio blacked out for a second.</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A follow-up video, Agatha, reclining in the tub, glasses on, wine in hand, looking like a literal goddess. Her voice was lazily amused as she spoke.</p><p>“Listen, if men get to post thirst traps by just sitting in cars and looking vaguely serious, I get to post this when it’s just you guys who see it.”</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>A close-up of Remi, standing at the bathroom door, staring directly at the camera with the expression of a creature who has been Betrayed.</p><p>Caption: She thinks bath time is a personal attack</p><p>Rio threw her phone onto the bed and screamed into her pillow.</p><p>This was too much.</p><p>Because Agatha Harkness wasn’t just hot. She wasn’t just hilarious. She was also unfairly, devastatingly, unbearably charming in a way that was so much worse than Rio had ever prepared for.</p><p>And worst of all?</p><p>She couldn’t stop watching. She couldn’t stop yearning.</p>

<p>Rio was spiralling. On a daily basis.</p><p>At this point, checking Agatha’s Snapchat had become part of her daily routine. Wake up. Check the time. Check Agatha’s Snapchat. Regret everything. Repeat.</p><p>So when an interview clip featuring Agatha popped up on her Twitter feed, she clicked on it instantly.</p><p>It was a new late-night appearance and Agatha was perched effortlessly on the talk show couch, all sharp cheekbones and easy charm, dressed in a purple suit that should have been illegal.</p><p>“You’re pretty private," the host was saying. “But you do have social media, with a lot of followers, what’s your relationship with it?"</p><p>“Oh, I post sometimes,"Agatha said smoothly, flashing that lazy, movie-star grin. “I don’t post often though, I like my privacy."</p><p>“So no secret socials that aren’t accessible to the public?”</p><p>“No of course not, I’m an open book.”</p><p>Rio choked on her drink.</p><p>Excuse me???</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>Agatha had posted. With shaking hands, Rio tapped in.</p><p>A video on her story. Agatha, cackling, still in her suit, clearly laugh-crying at the interview clip playing on her laptop.</p><p>“No of course not,"she repeated mockingly, then snorted. "I would literally rather die than let random people see what I actually post."</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>A screenshot of her private Instagram profile. Oh god. She had Agathas private instagram handle!!!</p><p>@Agatharemiandscratch</p><p>Caption: “This is the only account that matters. All my actual closest friends and family are on snap and here, no one else. If you see my public page, congrats! You know nothing about me."</p><p>Rio dropped her phone. She wasn’t supposed to be here. She wasn’t just following Agatha’s private Snapchat—she had been accidentally added to her inner circle. A group that, apparently, consisted of her closest friends and personal contacts.</p><p>Rio was a nobody. And Agatha Harkness—award-winning actress, international superstar, painfully gorgeous human being, had no idea she existed.</p><p>And yet, here she was. Seeing things no fan was ever meant to see. This was so much worse than she thought. And she had no idea what to do about it.</p><p>Rio stared at her phone, heart pounding. She should not be doing this. Really. But at this point, she had already stumbled too far into Agatha Harkness’s secret life and there was no way she was just going to—what? Walk away? Pretend she didn’t know? Be normal about it?</p><p>No.</p><p>Because if there was one thing Rio had learned about herself, it was that she was she was not normal. She was pathologically incapable of letting things go once she was invested.</p><p>So, with a deep, slightly unhinged breath, she opened her instagram and tapped ‘Follow’ on @Agatharemiandscratch</p><p>Another Snap notification.</p><p>Her phone buzzed instantly. She clicked without thinking.</p><p>Agatha Harkness has posted a story to her instagram. Her real instagram that, oh god, only had 78 followers, her account public account had 180 million.</p><p>It was a black and white photo of her in the suit still, Remi sprawled across her lap.</p><p>Then, the next post to her instagram story:</p><p>@Theegreenwitch finally got their ass on Insta. Took you long enough</p><p>Rio stopped breathing.</p><p>Agatha—Agatha Harkness - thought she was someone she actually knew.</p><p>And she had just acknowledged her. Publicly. Well, publicly to her actual friends and family.</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>A post. A photo of Agatha’s laptop screen, open to her private Instagram, showing Rio’s username at the top of the new follower list.</p><p>Caption: Imagine it taking you years to make an instagram account</p><p>Rio was going to pass out.</p><p>This was officially out of control.</p><p>Because now? Now Agatha thought she was a friend. And Rio had absolutely no idea who she was supposed to be.</p><p>Rio was not okay.</p><p>Like, on a fundamental level, her entire body had short-circuited.</p><p>Because this? This was different.</p><p>It wasn’t a story or a random update to all of Agatha’s close friends.</p><p>This was a direct Snapchat.</p><p>To her. Agatha Harkness had messaged her. Personally.</p><p>She stared at the screen for a solid thirty seconds, her brain just looping the words over and over.</p><p>Agatha Harkness sent you a Snap.</p><p>And when she finally, finally tapped it open. It was a video. Rio hit play.</p><p>Agatha was lying on her couch, glasses on, wrapped in a blanket the size of a small country, lazily sipping a glass of wine.</p><p>“Alright, explain yourself," she said, raising an eyebrow. “What finally made you get an Instagram? I need to know. I demand an answer."</p><p>Then, and this was the part that almost killed her, Agatha leaned in closer, looking directly into the camera and said, in a mock-serious tone, “Is this a cry for help? Blink twice if you're in danger."</p><p>Rio dropped her phone onto her face. Because what the hell was she supposed to do now?!</p><p>This wasn't just casually lurking anymore. This was Agatha expecting a response.</p><p>And Rio, tragically, did not have the option to spontaneously combust.</p><p>Rio stared at her phone like it was a live grenade. Because Agatha Harkness was waiting for a response.</p><p>To a question that wasn’t even meant for her.</p><p>To someone, some actual friend—who Agatha thought she was talking to.</p><p>And Rio?</p><p>Rio was not that person.</p><p>Her first instinct was to just not reply. To throw her phone across the room and never log into Snapchat again.</p><p>But then—</p><p>Another direct Snap.</p><p>Another notification.</p><p>Agatha Harkness has sent you a Chat.</p><p>A. CHAT.</p><p>Rio practically ascended to another plane of existence. She did not open it immediately. She had to mentally prepare herself. And by "mentally prepare," she meant scream silently into her hands for a full minute.</p><p>Then, finally, she clicked on it.</p><p>Agatha: HELLO. EXPLAIN YOURSELF.</p><p>Agatha: Are you ignoring me??</p><p>Agatha: How dare you.</p><p>Rio wheeze-laughed so hard she almost died. Oh god. Oh god. She had to say something.</p><p>Her thumbs hovered over the keyboard, heart slamming against her ribs.</p><p>What the hell was she supposed to say?! She couldn’t just be like, ‘Hey, funny story, I’m not actually your friend, I’m just some random gay woman who has been secretly obsessed with your secret Snapchat for weeks!’</p><p>No. No, that would be a disaster.</p><p>She needed something vague. Something neutral. Something that wouldn’t make Agatha suspicious.</p><p>So, with every single one of her nerves on fire, she typed:</p><p>Rio: idk, felt like it was time lol</p><p>And sent it.</p><p>And then immediately regretted it because who even says that?! What kind of boring, vague, loser response was that?!</p><p>Another Snap.</p><p>Agatha sent a video response immediately.</p><p>Rio did not survive it.</p><p>Because it was Agatha’s face, up close, eyes narrowed in playful suspicion.</p><p>“Mm-hmm," she hummed, dramatically squinting. "Sure. I’ll allow it—for now."</p><p>Then, just as Rio was about to recover, Agatha smirked and said—</p><p>“I’ll be keeping an eye on you."</p><p>And then winked. WINKED.</p><p>Rio was dead.</p><p>Because now?</p><p>Now Agatha Harkness was watching her. Was this catfishing? Was she catfishing one of the most famous women in the world. Rio was never going to emotionally recover from this.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>For the next twenty-four hours, Rio lived in a state of absolute, gut-churning panic.</p><p>Because now, somehow, impossibly, she had a direct line to Agatha Harkness.</p><p>And worse? Agatha expected her to be a normal person. A real person.  A friend or family member.</p><p>Which Rio, tragically, was not.</p><p>She spent the entire day overthinking everything, should she reply more? Less? Should she comment on Agatha’s snaps like a normal friend would? Should she just never open the app again and move to another country?</p><p>She needed a distraction from the tangled mess she now found herself in.</p><p>She went out with Alice.</p><p>Which, under normal circumstances, would have been a good thing. Alice was her best friend, the one person in her life who could drag her out of her own head and force her to have fun.</p><p>But in this specific case, on this particular night?</p><p>It was a catastrophic mistake.</p><p>Because Rio, in a moment of tragic, unforgivable stupidity, in her drunken haze, posted Snapchat stories of her night out. Snap stories which included her actual face. Because she was dumb and drunk and for a moment forgot that Agatha Harkness could see her posts.</p><p>Snap.</p><p>A video of her and Alice at a bar, Rio laughing into her drink while Alice ranted about something wildly unimportant.</p><p>Snap.</p><p>A photo of their drinks, captioned: Alice is on her fourth conspiracy theory of the night. Send help.</p><p>Snap.</p><p>A mirror selfie in the bathroom, her actual, real-life face staring back at the camera, completely ruining her secret double life. Crop top, toned stomach and blazer all on show.</p><p>Snapchat notifications.</p><p>Agatha Harkness has sent you a Chat.</p><p>Rio blacked out for a second, the realisation hitting her as she pulled her story upwards to see who had viewed her stories. Agatha had seen. Had seen all of them.</p><p>She clicked on it with the shaky hands of a person about to meet their doom.**</p><p>Agatha: ????</p><p>Agatha: Who the hell are you.</p><p>Agatha: HELLO?</p><p>Rio stared. Then stared harder. Because this was it.</p><p>This was the end.</p><p>Agatha knew. She knew.</p><p>And Rio?</p><p>Rio was completely, 100%, irreversibly screwed.</p><p>Rio was going to throw up. (She did throw up).</p><p>Or pass out. Or die in some other, equally dramatic way because Agatha Harkness had just discovered the truth because Rio had been stupid enough to post stories tonight.</p><p>And now? Now she was waiting for an answer.</p><p>She had two choices.</p><p>1. Tell the truth and admit that she was a complete stranger who had accidentally stumbled into Agatha’s most private social media account and then—like a complete dumbass just stayed.</p><p>2. Run. Run far away and never use snapchat ever again.</p><p>And Option 2 was looking really tempting right now.</p><p>Her phone buzzed again.</p><p>Agatha: Are you ignoring me?</p><p>Agatha: I literally just saw you post. You’re holding your phone.</p><p>Rio panicked and did the worst possible thing. She opened the chat.</p><p>Which meant Agatha could see that she had read the messages.</p><p>Which meant she had no escape.</p><p>So, practically vibrating with anxiety, she finally typed back:</p><p>Rio: okay so. this is awkward.</p><p>Rio:… funny story.</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>Agatha sent a video.</p><p>Rio opened it like she was defusing a bomb.</p><p>Agatha was sitting at her kitchen counter, wine glass in hand, adorable glasses perched on her nose, squinting at the camera like she was studying a new species.</p><p>“Go on,"she said, sipping dramatically.</p><p>Rio wanted the ground to swallow her up.</p><p>Rio: so. uhh. funny thing is. i was never supposed to be here.</p><p>Rio: i think u added me by accident</p><p>Rio: and then i just. stayed. bc i was scared u’d notice if i left.</p><p>Rio: so. hi.</p><p>She sent the messages and immediately regretted all of her life choices.</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>Another video from Agatha.</p><p>This time, Agatha didn’t say anything at first.</p><p>She just raised an eyebrow, lips pressed together in amused disbelief and stared directly into the camera for an aggressively long time. Then, she finally parted her lips and spoke.</p><p>“So let me get this straight," she said. "You realized you weren’t supposed to be here, panicked, and then just… stayed? Like a feral cat who accidentally wandered into someone’s house and refused to leave?"</p><p>Rio gave a short manic burst of laughter at the comparison.</p><p>Rio: basically yes</p><p>Rio: except the cat also found u really attractive and made terrible decisions because of it</p><p>And then, because she was already doomed anyway (and was drunk), she hit send.</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>Agatha sent a chat back immediately.</p><p>Agatha: Oh.</p><p>Agatha: Well.</p><p>Agatha: I see.</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>A photo, of Agatha’s face. Looking directly into the camera. Smirking.</p><p>Caption: So you think I’m attractive?</p><p>Rio screamed into her hands.</p><p>WHAT HAD SHE DONE.</p><p>Rio was too drunk for this. Or not drunk enough.</p><p>Like, on a molecular level, she did not have the sobriety required to handle flirting with Agatha Harkness in real-time.</p><p>Because that was what was happening now. Somehow, against all logic and reason, she was currently in a back-and-forth, increasingly chaotic flirtation with one of the most famous actresses in the world.</p><p>And it had all started because she accidentally admitted she found Agatha hot.</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>Another video.</p><p>Agatha, sipping her wine, eyebrow raised.</p><p>“So," she said, swirling her glass dramatically, “how long have you been secretly thirsting after me, exactly?"</p><p>Rio, having returned to the table, snorted so hard Alice turned to stare at her.</p><p>"Why are you making weird noises?" Alice asked, narrowing her eyes suspiciously. "Who are you texting?"</p><p>Rio did not answer. Because she was too busy panicking over how to respond.</p><p>And because she was exactly three drinks past responsible decision-making, she did the dumbest possible thing.</p><p>She filmed a video back.</p><p>Snap.</p><p>“Honestly?" Rio said, leaning into frame, grinning like an idiot. "Ever since I saw you in glasses cooking pasta. It awakened something in me."</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>Agatha’s reply was almost instant.</p><p>A photo, biting her lip like she was pretending to think really hard about something.</p><p>Caption: So what I’m hearing is… I should wear my glasses more?</p><p>Rio blacked out for the millionth time.</p><p>Rio: that would be dangerous for my health actually</p><p>Rio: but also yes</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>Agatha sent another video.</p><p>And Rio, hopeless, doomed, fully invested in this mess, opened it immediately.</p><p>Agatha was reclining on her couch now, smirking at the camera, glasses perched at the end of her nose.</p><p>“Wow," she said, voice going deliberately sultry. “Didn’t realize I had this much power over you. Interesting."</p><p>Snap.</p><p>Rio filmed back immediately.</p><p>“Okay, you need to stop," she said, pointing dramatically at the camera. “Because if you keep talking like that, I’m going to lose my mind and say something embarrassing."</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>Agatha: Now I’m curious. What’s the embarrassing thing?</p><p>Rio: not falling for that trap</p><p>Agatha: Oh come on. Just a little embarrassment. For me.</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>A photo of Agatha pouting dramatically at the camera.</p><p>Caption: Pretty please?</p><p>Rio almost screamed in public. And because she was a disaster of a human being, she typed a response.</p><p>Rio: u know ur dangerously hot right? like. u have to be aware of this</p><p>Agatha: Oh, I’m aware. But it’s fun hearing you say it</p><p>Agatha: Drunk you is cute</p><p>Rio ignored Alices questions as she stared at her phone in awe.</p><p>Rio nearly ascended into the heavens. Because this? This was dangerous.</p><p>And she wasn’t entirely sure she wanted it to stop.</p>

<p>The next morning (afternoon if you were being specific), Rio woke up with a raging hangover, a vague sense of impending doom and full of regret.</p><p>She had done many questionable things in her life, but flirting with Agatha freaking Harkness over Snapchat while drunk off her ass?</p><p>That was unhinged.</p><p>Oh god, last night, she flirted with Agatha Harkness.</p><p>AGATHA. HARKNESS.</p><p>Like it was a casual, everyday thing. Like she wasn’t just some random gay woman who had accidentally infiltrated her private Snapchat and then proceeded to flirt recklessly with a literal movie star.</p><p>And now?</p><p>Now she had to live with it.</p><p>With the knowledge that a famous, devastatingly attractive woman knew she found her hot.</p><p>Because, for some ungodly reason, Rio had zero self-preservation skills.</p><p>Her phone buzzed.</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>Agatha Harkness has posted a story.</p><p>Rio clicked so fast she almost dropped her phone.</p><p>The first image. A black screen with white text.</p><p>Caption: Some of you should drink more often. Highly entertaining. 10/10</p><p>Rio froze. Because that was about her. That was 100% about her.</p><p>And the worst part?</p><p>She could hear Agatha’s smug voice in her head as she wrote it. She closed her eyes and exhaled.</p><p>Get a grip, Rio. She clicked into the next post on Agathas story.</p><p>A video, Agatha standing in her kitchen, hair half up, half falling out of the messy bun it had once been, wearing an oversized sweatshirt that was definitely stolen from someone else.</p><p>"I am making coffee,"she announced dramatically, slamming the coffee grounds onto the counter. "This is a high-stakes mission. If I do not get caffeine into my system in the next five minutes, I’ll commit crimes."</p><p>She clicked through to the next post.</p><p>A photo of her laptop screen, a Zoom meeting in progress, Agatha had put crying emojis over each persons face.</p><p>Caption: If I look interested enough, maybe they won’t ask me to contribute</p><p>The next snap.</p><p>A blurry video of Remi jumping onto Agatha’s desk mid-zoom meeting, knocking over an entire cup of coffee.</p><p>“Oh my god—REMI, YOU LITTLE, aaargghgg!”</p><p>The next snap in the story.</p><p>A mirror selfie, Agatha, half-dressed, a jacket hanging off one shoulder, hair still kind of a mess, face set in mock-serious contemplation.</p><p>Caption: If I leave my house, does that mean I have to interact with people? And if so, is it too late to cancel all my plans?</p><p>Rio continued clicking, it was only 14:30 and Agatha had already had a full day by the looks of her story.</p><p>A video of Agatha in her car, sunglasses on, deadpan expression.</p><p>“I just made eye contact with a man at a red light, and he nodded at me. Like we had a moment. Sir, I am gay. Please calm down."</p><p>Rio was fully invested at this point (well not really at this point, she’d been invested since day one of being added).</p><p>Because no one else that was just normal got to see this.</p><p>The world only knew Movie Star Agatha—composed, confident, untouchable. But this? This was Agatha in her natural state—half-feral, dramatic, and barely functioning.</p><p>Rio was obsessed and maybe a little bit in love.</p><p>Rio had, however,  fully convinced herself that Agatha was done with her.</p><p>She had flirted too hard, exposed herself as a dumbass and a creeper, and surely, surely, Agatha had better things to do than entertain some random woman who had accidentally infiltrated her private Snapchat.</p><p>So she braced herself for silence.</p><p>For the inevitable moment where Agatha would get bored, realise Rio should not have access to Agatha unfiltered and quietly remove her.</p><p>And yet as she was wallowing in embarrassment and self pity. A snap chat notification came through.</p><p>Agatha Harkness has sent you a Chat.</p><p>Rio choked on air.</p><p>She opened it so fast she nearly dropped her phone.</p><p>Agatha: Recovering from last night? Or do you always go radio silent after bombarding someone with flirtatious videos and chats.</p><p>Rio wheeze-laughed immediately.</p><p>This woman was dangerous, in the most delightful way.</p><p>Rio: okay first of all. rude.</p><p>Rio: second of all. i thought u were done entertaining my nonsense so i was mentally preparing to be ghosted</p><p>Snap. A direct snap.</p><p>Agatha sent a video.</p><p>And Rio, hopeless, doomed, fully aware she was in too deep, opened it.</p><p>Agatha was lounging in her car, head tilted back, sun glasses slipping down her nose, an infuriating smirk on her lips.</p><p>“Ghost you?" she drawled, raising an eyebrow. “Why would I do that? I’m having fun."</p><p>Rio blackout malfunctioned for a full five seconds.</p><p>Rio: define fun</p><p>Agatha: Messing with you. Watching you panic. Very entertaining.</p><p>Agatha: You have an expressive face, even over chat</p><p>Rio died because what the hell was she supposed to do with this information?</p><p>Agatha wasn’t ignoring her. She was actively engaging. Flirting. Teasing. Like she enjoyed this just as much as Rio did.</p><p>Rio was not prepared for Agatha’s next message.</p><p>Agatha: So, where exactly do you exist in the world, mystery woman?</p><p>Rio blinked. She hadn’t really thought about it before, but—yeah. Agatha had no idea who she was or where she lived. She was just some random gay disaster that conveniently lived not too far from gated community of the elite.</p><p>For a moment, Rio debated lying.</p><p>Saying she lived five states away to remove the possibility of anything remotely real happening. She laughed at the thought, who did she think she was - of course nothing real would happen.</p><p>But instead, she typed:</p><p>Rio: about 45 mins outside the city.</p><p>Agatha: Oh? So if I needed a getaway driver, you’d be within range?</p><p>Rio: absolutely. no questions asked. where are we going, what are we stealing, i’m in</p><p>Snap.</p><p>Agatha sent her a video, of her, grinning at the camera, now back home and reclining on the couch.</p><p>“Good to know I have a criminal on standby,"she said, smirking. "Now tell me—what do you do when you're not plotting hypothetical heists?"</p><p>Rio hesitated for half a second before typing the truth:</p><p>Rio: florist</p><p>There was a long pause.</p><p>Snap.</p><p>A photo of Agatha’s face.</p><p>Caption: You’re telling me I’ve been flirting with a woman who literally spends all day around flowers??</p><p>Rio grinned.</p><p>Rio: yes. why is this shocking.</p><p>Agatha: It’s not. It’s just seems so on brand for you.</p><p>Rio: on brand how??</p><p>Agatha: Oh, you know. Soft, romantic, makes bad decisions when drunk. It tracks.</p><p>Rio screamed into her hands. Because Agatha was still flirting.</p><p>And now, Agatha knew she wasn’t far away.</p><p>This was dangerous.</p><p>And Rio didn’t want it to stop. Rio had had all control of her life.</p><p>Over the next few days, checking Agatha’s Snapchat story and keeping up with her occasional direct snaps and chats was a full-time job.</p><p>And today?</p><p>Today’s story updates were pure chaos.</p><p>Snap.</p><p>A video of Agatha on the floor, hair an absolute mess, dramatically suffering as a tiny fluffy rabbit perched on her chest.</p><p>“Señor Scratchy has decided I live here now," she said, poking the rabbit’s little face. "Send help. Or snacks. Preferably both."</p><p>Snap.</p><p>A photo of Remi, standing over Agatha with a deeply unimpressed expression, paws either side of her hips.</p><p>Caption: She’s judging me, but this is HER rabbit. Take responsibility for your tiny son, coward</p><p>Snap.</p><p>A blurry video of Agatha chasing Remi through her house, laughing breathlessly.</p><p>“SHE STOLE A PIECE OF TOAST—COME BACK HERE, YOU THIEVING LITTLE GREMLIN”</p><p>Snap.</p><p>A photo of another person, lounging on Agatha’s couch, Bucky Barnes, sunglasses on indoors, looking like he belonged on a magazine cover.</p><p>Caption: Unfortunately, this menace has returned</p><p>Snap.</p><p>A video of Bucky, now filming Agatha, shaking his head dramatically.</p><p>“The world somehow thinks you’re cool," he said.</p><p>Agatha, sitting cross-legged on the floor, full gremlin mode, chewing aggressively on a Twizzler. “That sounds like a them problem."</p><p>Snap.</p><p>A photo of Bucky again, along with a new notification direct to Rio.</p><p>Bucky Barnes has added you as a friend.</p><p>Rio froze. Because what the hell? Bucky Barnes was requesting her on Snapchat How did he even know she existed?!</p><p>Rio: agatha what did u do</p><p>Agatha: Nothing. But Bucky saw our messages</p><p>Rio: WHY WOULD U LET HIM DO THAT!</p><p>Agatha: Because he’s my best friend and it was funny. And now he’s invested.</p><p>Rio groaned so loudly Alice , who had come for dinner, turned to stare at her.</p><p>“What now?" Alice asked.</p><p>“I think I’ve been adopted by Agatha Harkness and Bucky Barnes against my will," Rio muttered.</p><p>Alice blinked. “What?”</p><p>"…Nothing, just ignore me?", her eyes dove back to her phone.</p><p>Agatha was still flirting. And now? Bucky was here too.</p><p>Which meant things were about to get even more surreal.</p><p>Rio was still reeling from the fact that Bucky Barnes had added her on Snapchat when her phone buzzed again.</p><p>Bucky Barnes has sent you a Chat.</p><p>Rio stared at it in horror.</p><p>Because what the hell was she supposed to say to this man?!</p><p>Heart pounding, she opened it.</p><p>Bucky: Yo. Just a heads-up. If you leak any of Agatha’s private shit, I will personally hunt you down.</p><p>Rio choked on air. Because what the fuck. She was being threatened by one of the Hollywood elite.</p><p>Rio: ok first of all terrifying introduction ty for that</p><p>Rio: second of all why would i leak anything. do i look like a fool</p><p>Bucky: Idk, I don’t know you. You could be a fool</p><p>Rio: rude</p><p>Snap.</p><p>Bucky sent a video, him, leaning back against Agatha’s couch, looking way too smug.</p><p>“I mean, let’s be real," he said, smirking at the camera in an eerily similar way to Agatha. "You’re obviously obsessed with her to have gone along with her thinking you were Pamela for as long as you have”.</p><p>Rio screamed internally. OMG. Thats who Agatha had meant to add, Pamela Isley ‘the green witch’ of Hollywood. A woman who had earned the nickname due to her protects and work around environmental matters. Director of the upcoming movie Agatha had been cast in.</p><p>But also, how dare he. How dare he just clock her like that within seconds of knowing of her existence.</p><p>Rio: LISTEN. i am simply here. observing. minding my business. nothing more.</p><p>Snap. Bucky had posted to his story.</p><p>A photo of Agatha, sitting on the floor with her arms wrapped around Remi, looking vaguely suspicious.</p><p>Caption: the face when I’m interrogating your new girlfriend</p><p>Rio lost her entire mind.</p><p>Rio: AGATHA WTF</p><p>Bucky: LMAO, you know I can see your name flashing on her phone right?</p><p>Bucky: Oh yeah, she’s got it bad for you.</p><p>A snapchat from Agatha.</p><p>Agatha: Ignore him, I do most of the time</p><p>Rio, completely oblivious to Alice watching her lose her mind, squealing like a child at a fair.</p><p>Because not only was Agatha still flirting, but now Bucky was involved. And judging by how entertained they both seemed, this was only going to get worse.</p>

<p>Over the next week, Rio noticed a shift in Agatha’s posts.</p><p>It wasn’t a dramatic change, Agatha still posted the occasional chaotic pet snap (Remi stealing an entire sandwich, Señor Scratchy hopping into an open grocery bag like it was his new home), and she still sent the occasional teasing message whenever Rio said something particularly flustered in their chats. But the tone of her story was different.</p><p>The silly, everyday disasters were still there, but they were fewer, interspersed with a different kind of content - work-related snaps, long hours on set, photos of scripts covered in notes, vague captions like ‘sleep is for the weak’ or ‘been in this trailer so long I think I live here now.’</p><p>Agatha was stressed, it was weird how in such a short amount of time she could tell that from her posts.</p><p>But the worst part?</p><p>Rio could tell that she was trying to hide it.</p><p>She still made jokes in the captions, still kept up the façade of being cool and unbothered, but there were cracks in the performance.</p><p>The selfies she posted between takes weren’t smug or playful anymore—they were exhausted. Her messy buns got messier, her glasses appeared more frequently and in some of the videos, her voice was a little more hoarse, a little more tired, like she was running on caffeine and sheer force of will.</p><p>Their messages became less frequent too.</p><p>Rio didn’t take it personally, she wasn’t entitled to Agatha’s attention, but it was a tiny bit upsetting to not have as much contact. She’d gotten used to waking up to something from her, whether it was a teasing comment, a blurry snap of Remi being an absolute menace, or some absurdly flirty message that made Rio want to launch herself into the sun.</p><p>Now, there were days where they barely talked at all.</p><p>When Agatha did reply, it was usually late, and her messages were shorter, less mischievous, more exhausted. A tiny bit dismissive.</p><p>Agatha: Sorry, long day. Work is kicking my ass.</p><p>Rio: ur telling me u can’t just roll onto set, say something cool, and leave? what do u mean acting is hard</p><p>Agatha: I know. I should just exist and get paid for it. Tragic oversight.</p><p>Sometimes, her replies were even shorter than that.</p><p>Agatha: I’m Dead</p><p>Agatha: If I have to hear one more “note” about my delivery, I will commit crimes</p><p>Rio didn’t push. She knew enough from their contact and her public persona that Agatha wasn’t the type to admit when she was struggling and she wasn’t about to be the weirdo who pried too much.</p><p>So instead, she kept things light, desperate to stay within Agathas orbit. Even if she was a temporary distraction for the mega star.</p><p>Whenever Agatha did message, Rio responded with something dumb, something teasing, something that required zero effort to answer.</p><p>Rio: i think u should just start improvising. go completely off script. say whatever feels right in the moment. maybe throw in a musical number</p><p>Agatha: I think that’s how I get fired</p><p>Rio: counterpoint: ur a superstar. what are they gonna do. tell u no?? unacceptable. stage a coup</p><p>She wasn’t sure if it helped, exactly.</p><p>But Agatha still responded, even if it was just a half-hearted comeback or an exhausted laugh.</p><p>And somehow, the tone of their conversations changed again, despite Agatha’s hectic schedule, the replies weren’t just short and stressed anymore—they were a bit more personal, a bit more playful again.</p><p>It started with little things: a joke about Rio’s cat obsession, a sarcastic comment about Rio’s constant “I’m not a morning person” messages. But slowly, Agatha began slipping in personal questions and comments, ones that felt a little less like ‘I might just be screwing with you’ and more like genuine friendship.</p><p>It was subtle at first. A ‘what are you doing tonight?’ just to fill in the awkward space, or a ‘I can’t stop thinking about that dumb joke you made the other day.’ Sometimes, Rio found herself laughing for no reason, reading Agatha’s messages, wishing for the chance to speak to her face-to-face.</p><p>It was like an unspoken rhythm between them, this snapchat conversation that had shifted, had become comfortable. They were friends. Agatha might’ve been a superstar but their chats didn’t feel like that. They were two people who could talk about anything without pretenses, who didn’t care about the gap between celebrity and regular person.</p><p>One afternoon, Rio had a message from Agatha.</p><p>Agatha: Hey. So this might be a weird question, but do you like coffee?</p><p>Rio blinked at the screen, wondering if she was seeing things. Coffee? Where was she going with this? Was it a set up for a joke?</p><p>Rio: I mean, yes? Who doesn’t like coffee?</p><p>Agatha: I was thinking… I’ve been feeling kinda frazzled lately. I could use some caffeine and a break from filming. Would you want to meet up? Maybe grab coffee somewhere?</p><p>Rio’s heart skipped a beat. Wait, what?</p><p>Her stomach churned. Was this real? Was Agatha—Agatha Harkness—actually asking her to hang out for coffee?</p><p>Rio: Wait, hold up. Are you seriously asking me to get coffee with you? Or is this some kind of cruel joke to mess with me?</p><p>She immediately regretted sending the message. It sounded too pathetic, too dumb. But to her surprise, Agatha replied almost immediately.</p><p>Agatha: No joke. I think you’re fun to talk to. I’m actually curious to meet the person who sends me the most ridiculous messages while I’m stuck in my trailer</p><p>Rio felt a wave of nervous excitement flood her chest. Agatha had actually said it—she thought Rio, weird Rio, was fun. And she wanted to meet her? That felt… surreal.</p><p>Rio: Okay, I’m in. But this might be weird for you. I’m just a regular person, you know.</p><p>Agatha: I’m a regular person too you know. I just need a coffee and a distraction for a bit. I promise I won’t bite.</p><p>Rio: Okay, okay, so coffee. But no pressure, if you change your mind</p><p>Agatha: No pressure on you either but I wont. Just you, me, and some good coffee</p><p>And suddenly, Rio was buzzing with anticipation.</p><p>She hadn’t expected any of this, hadn’t imagined that the casual flirtation would lead to something more real. She knew Agatha was probably just looking for a moment of escape from her crazy, high-pressure life, but still, the fact that Agatha was interested in her—like willing to be seen in public interested—made Rio’s heart race in a way she hadn’t expected.</p><p>Coffee with Agatha.</p><p>She had no idea what would come of it, but there was something magnetic about the way Agatha made even the simplest things feel like a big deal.</p><p>Rio could hardly believe her luck. She was going to meet Agatha in real life!</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Over the next few days, Rio found herself checking Agatha’s stories more than usual (which meant that rather than rewatching a few times, she was rewatching them over and over, not that she was obsessed or anything. Except she totally was).</p><p>She couldn’t help it, she was down bad for the woman without ever having met her in person. But she would. For a date. A coffee date.</p><p>The day they were meeting Agatha posted a story of herself in front of a window, a sunlit glow casting across her face. She looked relaxed, almost carefree, and Rio couldn’t help but notice the smile tugging at the corner of her lips.</p><p>Caption: Today is going to be a good day. I’m manifesting it</p><p>It was a subtle post, but Rio had a feeling it was a reference to their coffee date later. She was already feeling a little nervous—would it be awkward? Would Agatha even show up? Was this just another one of those casual things that Rio had somehow made into something that it wasn’t?</p><p>Rio felt that familiar tension gnawing at her. Was Agatha just being friendly, did she flirt with everyone? Or was there something more?</p><p>As the hours passed, Agatha’s snap stories kept coming, each one innocent but carrying a subtle sense of anticipation. She posted a photo of a book, casually flipped over on the coffee table.</p><p>Caption: Going to finish a few chapters and start getting ready</p><p>The final post to her story, the one that hit Rio the hardest, was posted just an hour before they were supposed to meet. It was of Agatha, in a soft green sweater, standing in front of a large mirror with a playful little half-smile and her hair down. She looked effortlessly pretty, the kind of beauty that was effortless.</p><p>The caption, though, was what made Rio’s heart skip:</p><p>Caption: Ready. Here’s to coffee dates and good company</p><p>The words, so casual, hit Rio with the weight of reality. This definitely wasn’t just a meet-up—this was a date. Obviously she had delusions throughout the week that it was definitely a date and Agatha had been hinting at it all week, but now it felt real. Rio could barely keep her hands from shaking as she stared at the screen, trying to steady her breathing.</p><p>She had never felt more unprepared in her life. How did one show up for a date with Agatha Harkness of all people?</p><p>Rio spent the next few minutes pacing around her apartment, her thoughts racing a hundred miles per hour. She knew she had to calm down but it was hard when the thought of seeing Agatha in person made her feel like her heart was going to jump out of her chest.</p><p>Then, her phone buzzed with a notification.</p><p>Snapchat notification. Chat.</p><p>Agatha: I’m on my way. See you soon!</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but smile, the nervousness melting into excitement. She had no idea how this would go, whether it would be awkward, or if they’d just slip into a comfortable rhythm that they had over chat and snap. All she knew was that Agatha wanted to meet. She was just as interested as Rio was. Maybe. Hopefully. Or she was setting her up for the biggest prank that would totally destroy her.</p><p>And that was enough to send a warm rush through Rio’s entire body before she felt like she’d been doused in cold water. Oh god, what was she doing! What is this was a joke.</p><p>Rio had tried to plan the perfect outfit, but now she wasn’t sure if anything she wore would be good enough. She opted for something simple, similar to Agathas outfit on her story, a soft cream sweater, jeans, and boots.</p><p>When she arrived at the café, she saw Agatha sitting just inside, looking out the window, a coffee cup in hand and another on the table waiting. She looked completely effortless, her hair falling in natural curls around her shoulders, and there was that same soft smile on her face as she spotted Rio walking through the door.</p><p>“Hey, you made it!”, Agatha’s voice was warm, and Rio couldn’t help but feel a little lighter as she walked over to the table.</p><p>Agatha slid her chair out for her and motioned for Rio to sit down, her eyes never leaving Rio’s as she did. There was something in that look, a little spark, a glint of genuine excitement that made Rio’s heart race all over again.</p><p>“I’m glad you came,"Agatha said softly, settling in with her coffee.</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, trying to have the tension in her shoulders finally release. This wasn’t some casual thing anymore. It wasn’t about overthinking it.</p><p>She kept repeating like a mantra: We’re just two people, meeting up for coffee. And maybe, just maybe, it would turn into something more.</p><p>As Rio scooted into her seat, the weight of the moment hit her. Her heart was racing, and every breath felt like it echoed in her chest. She tried to remind herself that this was just coffee. It wasn’t a red carpet event, and Agatha wasn’t some unapproachable superstar—she was just a person.</p><p>But still, Rio couldn’t help the feeling of being just a little starstruck. This was Agatha Harkness, the actress she’d been watching on screen for years. And harassing over snapchat for weeks on end. And now, they were sitting across from each other, sipping coffee like it was the most normal thing in the world.</p><p>“Took you long enough! I was starting to think I’d have to drink this coffee alone,” she said with a playful wink, lifting her cup. Her voice was warm, full of genuine affection but there was a hint of flirtation in it, too.</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flushed as she sat down, trying not to let her nerves show.</p><p>“Sorry, I got a little lost on the way here,” Rio muttered, her hands nervously adjusting her jacket as she avoided Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t miss a beat. She leaned forward a little, her eyes glimmering with that characteristic spark that Rio couldn’t seem to stop getting lost in.</p><p>“You don’t have to apologize. I just like making you squirm a little. It’s cute,” Agatha teased, her smile widening as she took a sip of her coffee.</p><p>Rio felt her pulse quicken at the flirty tone, her cheeks burning, blushing bright red. She tried to play it cool but couldn’t stop the small, nervous laugh that escaped her.</p><p>“You really like to mess with me, huh?” Rio joked, trying to mask her nervousness with humor.</p><p>“Oh, I’m just getting started,” Agatha said with a wink, clearly enjoying Rio’s reaction.</p><p>Then she pulled out her phone, holding it up to snap a quick picture of their coffee cups on the table. Rio wasn’t sure if Agatha was trying to be subtle or just showing off that they were together. Either way, she couldn’t help but feel a little overwhelmed that she was part of Agathas snapchat story.</p><p>Agatha captioned the story with a playful note:</p><p>Caption: Caffeine fix with a cute girl</p><p>Rio’s heart skipped a beat as she looked at the story. She stared at the post for a second, trying to hide the mix of emotions swirling inside her. Did she just call me cute? Was she serious? Or was Agatha just being charming like she always was?</p><p>When she looked back up at Agatha, she noticed the actress was watching her closely, a mischievous grin still on her face.</p><p>“Don’t get shy now,” Agatha teased. “It’s just coffee. Not like I’m gonna bite.”</p><p>Caffeine Fix with a Cute Girl. Thats all Rio had in her head.</p><p>Rio was going to die. Right here. Right now.</p><p>Not because of a freak accident or some dramatic Final Destination-style event, but because Agatha Harkness—actual, real-life, EGOT winner Agatha Harkness, had just called her cute and meant it?</p><p>And then posted it. On Snapchat.  Fair enough it didn’t have her face but you could see her torso and arms.</p><p>Rio stared at the caption, her brain buffering so hard she thought she might actually pass out. Did she misread it? Maybe she was hallucinating. Maybe the nerves had finally fried her last functioning brain cell, and she was imagining all of this—</p><p>“Are you going to drink your drink,” Agatha teased, setting her phone down. “I got you a cappuccino- thats the coffee you drink right?”</p><p>Rio jolted so hard she almost knocked her cup over. “I—yeah! Coffee! I drink…coffee.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, amused but also looking at Rio like she wasn’t entirely sure she was okay.</p><p>Desperate to distract herself, Rio grabbed her cup and took a sip.</p><p>And immediately regretted every decision she had ever made.</p><p>The coffee was near scorching  hot.</p><p>She gasped in shock, but instead of swallowing like a normal person, she somehow managed to choke on it. The burning liquid slid the wrong way, and in her panic, she sputtered—</p><p>—and drooled.</p><p>Hot coffee.</p><p>Down her chin.</p><p>Right in front of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>For a moment, there was complete silence.</p><p>Then Agatha blinked. “...Did you just drool?”</p><p>Rio slapped a hand over her mouth, eyes wide in horror. Oh god. Oh god. This wasn’t happening.</p><p>“I—uh—I—” She couldn’t even speak. She just frantically grabbed a napkin and started dabbing at her chin, hoping, praying, that Agatha would just pretend it didn’t happen.</p><p>Agatha did not pretend.</p><p>Instead, she just watched, her head tilting slightly, her expression shifting from amusement to genuine concern. “Are… are you okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded way too fast. “Mmhmm! Totally! This is fine! Everything’s fine! Coffee’s just—” she let out a nervous, strangled laugh, “—hot! Who knew, right?”</p><p>Agatha squinted at her like she was assessing whether Rio was having a medical emergency. “...You sure?”</p><p>“Yes! I do this all the time.”</p><p>“…You drool coffee down your chin all the time?”</p><p>Rio’s soul left her body. “I meant…no! I meant…I just—” She buried her face in her hands. “Oh my god.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, clearly trying so hard not to laugh but failing miserably. “Hey, it’s okay. At least it wasn’t, like, all down your nice cream sweater or something.”</p><p>That was supposed to be comforting, but it just made Rio groan louder. “You’re never gonna let me live this down, are you?”</p><p>“Oh, absolutely not.” Agatha leaned forward, resting her chin on her hand. “But, on the bright side, this is already the most entertaining coffee date I’ve ever been on.”</p><p>Date.</p><p>She said that word again. Date.</p><p>Rio short-circuited all over again, her brain refusing to function. “I—I—uh—”</p><p>Agatha just smiled, sipping her coffee like Rio wasn’t actively self-destructing across the table.</p><p>“So,” she said casually, “tell me more about you. I know you’re a florist, but what else is there? Any fun stories? Besides the whole coffee drooling thing, of course.”</p><p>Rio groaned. “Please let me recover first.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Take your time. I’m enjoying the show.”</p><p>Rio, still feeling the nervous energy buzzing between them, squirmed in her seat. Finally, she asked the question that had been weighing on her mind since Agatha had first suggested meeting up.</p><p>“So, are you not worried about being seen?” Rio asked cautiously. “Like, with the paparazzi and stuff. Are they gonna show up here and make things awkward?”</p><p>Agatha paused for a moment, her smile softening. She put her cup down, her fingers tracing the rim absentmindedly.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said slowly, looking around the café. “This place is sort of my secret spot. It’s quiet, cozy, and I come here a lot. The regulars know me, but they don’t bother me.”</p><p>She glanced at Rio, the same relaxed, confident look on her face. “Most people don’t even care enough to take a second glance. They just want their coffee, and I want mine. Simple as that.”</p><p>Rio found herself relieved by Agatha’s words. It made sense—Agatha had probably carved out a little corner of her life where she could still feel somewhat like a normal person, not always under the spotlight.</p><p>But then, a playful grin spread across Agatha’s face again.</p><p>“Besides,” she added, her voice dropping just a little to a more teasing tone, “If anyone is going to be papped, it might as well be with someone as cute as you. I’m sure it would be a good shot.”</p><p>Rio’s face went hotter, but she couldn’t help the small laugh that escaped her lips. She wasn’t used to being on the receiving end of such confidence and it left her feeling a mix of flattered and completely overwhelmed.</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her seat, taking another sip of her coffee and giving Rio an expectant look.</p><p>“So,” she said casually, her eyes twinkling with curiosity, “You must have some interesting stories, right?”</p><p>Rio swallowed, trying to steady her breath. Now that they were finally sitting across from each other, the pressure seemed to suffocate her.</p><p>The coffee date stretched on, and despite Rio's nerves and embarrassing mishaps, the chemistry between the two of them was undeniable. They talked about everything from their favorite books to embarrassing childhood stories, and the conversation flowed so easily that time seemed to slip away without either of them noticing.</p><p>By the time they finished their coffee, the café was starting to empty out, and the afternoon sunlight had softened, casting a warm glow on everything. Rio sat back in her chair, feeling both content and a little sad that it was ending.</p><p>Agatha noticed the slight hesitation in Rio’s posture and smiled softly. “I don’t want this to end,” she said, her voice a little quieter now. “But I guess we should get going before they start kicking us out of here.”</p><p>Rio chuckled nervously, trying to shake off the slight heaviness in her chest. “Yeah, I suppose we should.”</p><p>As they stood up from the table, Agatha reached for her coat, her fingers brushing against Rio’s as she grabbed it. The contact sent a small electric jolt through Rio’s body, and she had to hold her breath for a second to calm her racing heart.</p><p>Agatha looked up at her, a sly grin curling on her lips. Without saying another word, she leaned in and pressed a gentle kiss on Rio’s cheek.</p><p>It was soft, lingering for only a moment, but it left Rio’s heart hammering in her chest. Her face flushed instantly, and she found herself frozen in place for a second. She didn’t know if it was the kiss or the way Agatha was looking at her, but the world felt like it had shifted slightly on its axis.</p><p>“I’ll see you soon, yeah?” Agatha asked, her voice light, as though nothing had happened. But Rio could see the sparkle in her eyes. Agatha knew exactly what that kiss meant.</p><p>Rio, still slightly dazed, nodded. “Yeah, definitely. I... I’ll be looking forward to it.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile widened, and she gave Rio a quick wink before turning to leave. Rio stood there for a moment, watching her walk out of the café, feeling like her legs might give way under her.</p><p>After a few moments, Rio finally snapped out of her daze and made her way home, feeling like she was floating.</p><p>Once she was settled in her pajamas she pulled up snapchat. Instantly clicking again to Agathas story. There were new snaps posted.</p><p>The first snap was of Agatha lounging on her couch at home, wearing an oversized hoodie and sipping from a new cup of coffee.</p><p>Caption: Home, coffee, and a little reflection. Sometimes, a good conversation makes everything better. ❤️</p><p>Rio’s heart skipped as she stared at the story. It wasn’t much, just a simple post, but there was something in the way Agatha had captioned it—like she was reflecting on their time together. Rio couldn't help but feel like she was part of that reflection.</p><p>A few moments later, another snap came through. This time, Agatha was standing in her kitchen, dancing around with a random song playing in the background. She looked completely carefree, laughing as she spun around as Remi bounced around her. It was chaotic, lighthearted, and completely Agatha. The caption this time was just one word:</p><p>Caption: Mood</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh to herself. It was exactly the kind of spontaneous, goofy thing she now knew Agatha to do when she was alone at home.</p><p>A final snap popped up. This one was a little more intimate. Agatha had set her phone on a countertop and captured a soft, candid shot of herself sitting on the floor of her living room with her rabbit. There were candles lit in the background, the soft glow making Agatha’s features look even more radiant.</p><p>Caption: Grateful for today</p><p>Rio stared at the snap, feeling an overwhelming mix of emotions. The words seemed like they were meant just for her, even if they weren’t. She couldn’t shake the feeling that Agatha’s feelings were real, that everything they’d shared earlier wasn’t just playful flirtation—it was genuine.</p><p>Still, Rio didn’t want to get ahead of herself. Agatha was a superstar, after all, and Rio was just someone she’d met for coffee. She didn’t want to build up any expectations, but it was hard when Agatha’s posts were so captivating and seemed to hint at something more.</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure how to process it all, but one thing was for sure: she was hooked. Every post, every chat, every small interaction with Agatha was starting to feel like it meant everything.</p><p>She couldn’t wait to see what happened next.</p>

<p>The next few days passed in a blur of excitement for Rio.</p><p>After that coffee date, she and Agatha’s Snapchats had gone from casual to frequent and sometimes downright ridiculous. What started as the occasional “look at this cute cat I saw” snap had spiraled into a full-on exchange of chaotic energy.</p><p>Agatha sent Rio the dumbest, most unhinged snaps imaginable—her aggressively trying to flip a pancake and failing spectacularly, her standing in front of a mirror trying on a hat that was three sizes too big, or a zoomed-in video of her blankly staring at the camera as dramatic opera music played in the background.</p><p>Rio, in turn, sent her own brand of nonsense—flowers from the shop that she had given terrible names ( Caption: this is Gregory, the saddest tulip), a sneaky video of Alice falling off a step ladder (she was fine, but it was hilarious), and even an accidental snap where she meant to show Agatha a cute flower arrangement but ended up sending a picture of her thumb.</p><p>Somehow, this exchange of nonsense felt... weirdly intimate. Every snap felt like another little peek into Agatha’s real personality, not the glossy A-list version. And every time Rio’s phone buzzed, she felt that little thrill of anticipation, hoping it was Agatha.</p><p>One evening, like clockwork, Rio settled onto her couch, fully prepared to waste an irresponsible amount of time rewatching Agatha’s story posts.</p><p>The first snap? Agatha, grinning at a dimly lit bar, her arm around Bucky, the human golden retriever (with teeth) of a best friend.</p><p>Caption: Getting our karaoke on! 🎤 Don’t judge, we’re professionals. #ItsAllAboutTheVibe</p><p>Rio snorted. Professionals? If Agatha’s singing voice was anything like her pancake-flipping skills, this was about to be interesting.</p><p>The next snap was a chaotic video—Bucky, dramatically belting out a verse of some cheesy pop song, while Agatha tried to harmonize but kept dissolving into laughter. Her voice was shockingly good—like, ‘she could out-sing some Billboard charting artists’ good. But the moment Bucky hit a bad note, she lost it, her laugh ringing through the speakers.</p><p>Then, the next snap nearly made Rio drop her phone in surprise.</p><p>It was a much-drunker Agatha, cheeks flushed, hair slightly messy, the selfie angle all kinds of terrible.</p><p>Caption: Who needs talent when you’ve got confidence?!</p><p>Rio couldn’t stop herself from laughing. It was weirdly comforting, seeing Agatha not as the impossibly perfect actress the world knew, but as a goofy, drunk woman in her thirties who took unflattering drunk selfies like the rest of humanity.</p><p>And then—</p><p>A notification.</p><p>It wasn’t a story. It was a direct snap.</p><p>Rio tapped it open, and immediately, her heart did a gymnastics routine.</p><p>The video started with Agatha sitting in a corner booth, her chin resting in her hand, a dopey, mischievous grin plastered on her face. She blinked at the camera, clearly drunk but still composed enough to be dangerous.</p><p>“Riooooo,” she sing-songed, her voice a little too loud for the intimate setting. And of course, she still sounded like an angel even while drunk. Unfair.</p><p>Agatha paused dramatically, narrowing her eyes. “I’m having so much fun, but you know what would make it better?”</p><p>She gasped, as if struck by a sudden, genius realization. “You.”</p><p>Rio had approximately three brain cells left.</p><p>Agatha leaned closer to the camera, her grin widening. “Next time, we’re doing karaoke together. And I will be judging you.”She pointed a finger at the camera, swaying slightly as she did so.</p><p>Then she giggled, dropping her head onto the booth cushion. “Just so you know, you’re kinda... special.” She paused again, as if debating what she’d just said, then nodded to herself, very satisfied. “Yep. Special. In a good way. Okay, byeeee.”</p><p>She blew an exaggerated kiss to the camera before the snap ended.</p><p>Rio sat there, staring at her phone like it had just delivered life-altering news.</p><p>Did Agatha Harkness just call her special?</p><p>She replayed the snap. Twice. Okay, five times. Agatha was definitely drunk, but that message? It felt real. The fact that she had sent her that snap, in the middle of a night out with her best friend, meant something, right?</p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, trying to ignore the fact that her face was approximately the temperature of the sun.</p><p>She quickly recorded a response, determined to keep it cool even though her insides felt like a shaken soda can.</p><p>The video was short, just her shaking her head dramatically. “You’re so right—I’m absolutely judging you, Agatha Harkness! Karaoke queen or not.” She smirked. “But next time, I’ll be there. Just don’t get mad when I pick the worst duet song imaginable.”</p><p>She hovered over the send button, hesitating for a split second before pressing it.</p><p>Now, all she had to do was wait.</p><p>Which was, of course, impossible.</p><p>She turned on a movie to distract herself. A movie that may or may not have starred Agatha, but that was beside the point.</p><p>Then, her phone buzzed again.</p><p>New Snap from Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Rio sat up so fast she nearly knocked over her drink.</p><p>She opened it.</p><p>It was another video, Agatha in the back of a car, probably on her way home, looking still very tipsy but with the most ridiculously smug smile.</p><p>“You’re right, I’m a mess,” she admitted, dramatically flipping her hair. “But I don’t even care. Because guess what? You’re fun, Rio.”</p><p>She leaned a little too close to the camera, whispering conspiratorially, “Let’s meet up again. And this time, you have to do karaoke with me.”</p><p>Then, just as Rio was about to combust—</p><p>Agatha winked.</p><p>And added, “We’ll have our own little duet... in more ways than one.”</p><p>The snap ended.</p><p>Rio sat in stunned silence, her entire system malfunctioning.</p><p>She was so screwed. She was obsessed with this woman.</p><p>The next morning, Rio woke up to see a flurry of snap stories from Agatha, and she couldn't help but grin. It was clear from the first snap that Agatha was feeling the effects of her night out. The first photo showed Agatha curled up in bed, her hair a tangled mess, with a slightly pained expression on her face. Remi was nestled beside her, looking far more well-rested than she was.</p><p>Caption: Having a rough morning… But Remis still winning, she has lost of the bed</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh at the sight. Agatha was still as gorgeous as ever, even when half-dead from a night of karaoke and drinks. The way Remi was sprawled across her, like she was the one taking care of her, just added to the humor of the whole scene.</p><p>A few snaps later, Agatha posted a video of her a chaise across her bedroom, where Bucky was sprawled out, snoring loudly, wearing sunglasses despite it being morning. Agatha’s voice could be heard in the background, though her words were slightly muffled, and the caption read:</p><p>“Bucky’s still passed out like he doesn’t have a care in the world. At least he’s doing it in style”.</p><p>Then came the next snap, a video of Agatha holding her phone out in front of her as she slowly sat up in bed, rubbing her eyes. “I don’t know who allowed me to do karaoke in the first place,” she muttered, looking utterly exhausted. But then she flashed a mischievous grin at the camera and added, “Actually, I think I might’ve been born for the stage. But maybe next time I’ll avoid embarrassing myself.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, feeling like a small part of the chaotic energy Agatha had shared the previous night had seeped into her life. Agatha, though clearly hungover, was still radiating charm. It was the kind of relaxed, candid side that Rio loved seeing, one that felt human. Normal.</p><p>Then, a few snaps later, Agatha posted a photo of her breakfast—a giant bowl of cereal with a dramatic amount of sugar on top.</p><p>Caption: Cereal therapy. The only thing that will save me today. And yes, Remis eating my toast. No, I don’t care that she’s spoilt</p><p>Rio couldn’t resist sending a quick reply, teasing her:  I thought you were the one with the confidence to sing karaoke but can’t even keep your toast to yourself? 🙄</p><p>Agatha’s snap came through almost immediately in reply, a blurry selfie of her with Remi perched on her shoulder, looking like a bodyguard.</p><p>Caption: I regret nothing. Except maybe letting Bucky make me sing ‘Dancing Queen’.</p><p>Rio’s laughter bubbled up as she read her message, feeling the lighthearted connection they had.</p><p>The next few snaps on Agatha’s story showed a more domestic side of Agatha, still lounging in bed, with a few clips of Bucky finally waking up on the chaise, groaning and rubbing his eyes. There was something endearing about their shared hangover recovery, with Agatha posting little moments of frustration mixed with humor. It felt so normal so unlike the life that anyone would expect them both to lead.</p><p>Then, one last snap —a simple photo of Agatha, still looking disheveled but with a content smile on her face, holding up a cup of coffee.</p><p>Caption: This is the cure. I think I owe l an apology for my embarrassing karaoke skills. But you know what? It was totally worth it</p><p>Rio smiled at the screen, feeling a sense of closeness with Agatha that she hadn’t expected. The casual nature of their messages made it seem like they were old friends, not someone famous and someone who had just met her.</p><p>As she stared at the screen, Rio couldn’t help but feel excited about what would come next. Agatha was down to earth, funny, and even a little bit clumsy when she wasn’t being perfect. It felt like a connection worth pursuing.</p>

<p>Rio’s phone buzzed with a new Snapchat notification from Agatha. She opened it immediately, excitement surging through her, tangled up with nervous energy.</p><p>It was a picture of Agatha, effortlessly stunning in a smart-casual outfit, standing in front of an upscale restaurant. The warm glow of the lights behind her cast a golden sheen over her face, making her look even more glamorous, like she belonged in that world—because she did. Agatha Harkness wasn’t just anyone. She was the kind of person who frequented places like this, who moved through life with the kind of confidence that made people stop and stare.</p><p>Caption: How do you feel about trying this place out for dinner tomorrow? I’ve just had a business lunch here, and it’s gorgeous. I can get us a reservation. ❤️</p><p>Rio’s heart stuttered in her chest. A date? A real date?</p><p>She had been trying so hard not to overthink things, to play it cool, to not let herself get too carried away by the playful messages and lingering glances. But this—this was different. This wasn’t just coffee or a casual hang out. This was an actual date in a high-end restaurant, a place that practically screamed romance and exclusivity.</p><p>Her fingers trembled slightly as she typed back.</p><p>Rio: I’d love that! I’d love to join you!</p><p>She hit send before she could overanalyze every word, before she could spiral into wondering if she should’ve played it cooler or if she sounded too eager. Her stomach felt like it was doing backflips.</p><p>And then, another realization crashed over her.</p><p>She had to tell Alice.</p><p>Alice had been her best friend since childhood, the one person Rio had always been able to confide in. If there was anyone who would understand the sheer insanity of what was happening right now, it was Alice.</p><p>She quickly started typing.</p><p>Rio: I need to tell you something, and I can't keep it in anymore. I’m kind of freaking out, but I need to be honest.</p><p>Alice’s reply came almost instantly.</p><p>Alice: Okay, spill! You’re scaring me a little with this dramatic intro!</p><p>Rio inhaled sharply, her fingers hesitating over the screen. How was she even supposed to phrase this in a way that made sense?</p><p>Screw it.</p><p>Rio: I think I’m going on a date with Agatha Harkness. For real.</p><p>She barely had time to process what she’d just sent before Alice’s response exploded onto the screen.</p><p>Alice: WHAT. WHAT. WHAT??????? ARE YOU KIDDING ME. IS THIS A JOKE. RIO, WHAT ARE YOU EVEN SAYING RIGHT NOW.</p><p>Rio bit her lip, half laughing, half panicking.</p><p>Rio: I swear, Alice. We’ve been talking on snapchat for a while now. It started out kind of casual, you know? I met her for coffee last week. But then today, she asked me out. To this super fancy restaurant. And I think she’s serious about it. I don’t know if I’m freaking out more about the fact that it’s Agatha Harkness or because she actually seems to like me</p><p>Another long pause. It was almost agonizing.</p><p>Alice: RIO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING. RIO. WHAT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE “SEEMS TO LIKE YOU” OF COURSE SHE LIKES YOU. SHE JUST ASKED YOU ON A FANCY DATE????? HOW IS THIS HAPPENING. HOW IS THIS REAL. HOW IS THIS YOUR LIFE.</p><p>Alice: DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW INSANE THIS IS. I NEED YOU TO EXPLAIN EVERY DETAIL TO ME RIGHT NOW. WHEN DID THIS START. WHEN DID SHE START SNAPPING YOU. WHEN DID SHE DECIDE YOU WERE WORTHY OF HER GLAMOROUS ATTENTION. I NEED A TIMELINE. IM LOSING MY MIND.</p><p>Rio let out a strangled laugh, running a hand through her hair. Yeah, that made two of them.</p><p>Rio: I KNOW. I KNOW. It doesn’t feel real. I feel like I’m in some kind of alternate reality where things like this actually happen. Like, am I secretly the main character in some ridiculous rom-com and nobody told me?</p><p>Alice: Apparently, yes. I need to know EVERYTHING. What are you going to wear? Are you going to tell me every detail after? Is she as hot in real life as she is on screen?</p><p>Rio groaned, flopping back against her bed, phone clutched to her chest. What was she going to wear? What was she even supposed to wear to a date with Agatha Harkness in a restaurant like that? Was she supposed to go full glam? Was a dress too much? Would dressing casually make it seem like she wasn’t taking it seriously enough? And what if she said something stupid? What if she got all nervous and awkward and ruined everything?</p><p>She exhaled sharply, forcing herself to stop spiraling. Agatha had asked her out for a reason, right? She wasn’t doing this as a joke. She wasn’t just being nice.</p><p>She liked Rio.</p><p>That fact alone made her brain short-circuit.</p><p>Her phone buzzed again.</p><p>Alice: Listen. You’ve got this. I know you’re freaking out, but you’re amazing, Rio. Don’t overthink it. Just be yourself, and you two will have an incredible time. And please, for the love of everything, ring me the SECOND you get home. I need every single detail.</p><p>Rio let out a slow breath, feeling a little steadier. Alice was right. She needed to stop freaking out. She needed to just breathe.</p><p>This was real. This was happening.</p><p>And tomorrow night, she had a date with Agatha Harkness.</p><p>The next morning, Rio woke up feeling jittery. Tonight. It was happening tonight.</p><p>She had barely gotten used to the idea of Agatha flirting with her, and now she was supposed to sit across from her at a fancy restaurant, making eye contact, eating expensive food, and acting like a normal human being?</p><p>Her phone buzzed. A Snapchat notification from Agatha.</p><p>She opened it to see a picture of a market stall overflowing with fresh flowers. Agatha stood in front of them, one perfectly manicured hand reaching toward a bouquet of deep red roses.</p><p>Caption: Flowers are very on theme for me at the minute.*</p><p>Rio’s heart nearly exploded. That was a reference to her.</p><p>Okay, keep it cool, she told herself, even though she was literally hugging her phone.</p><p>She snapped a quick response, showing a close-up of the tulips in the background, adding:</p><p>Rio: The tulips look good! Looking forward to tonight, see you soon Agatha</p><p>After sending it, she collapsed onto her bed and groaned into a pillow. She sounded so boring. How was she supposed to flirt when Agatha was so effortlessly cool?</p><p>The rest of the day was a blur of nerves. Every outfit she tried on either felt too much or not enough. She changed at least five times, overthinking everything from her earrings to whether she should attempt eyeliner (she shouldn’t but she did).</p><p>Eventually, she settled on her favorite little black dress, a cute jacket, and some heels that were just high enough to feel fancy without the risk of breaking her ankle.</p><p>As she was checking herself in the mirror, her phone buzzed again.</p><p>Another Snapchat story post from Agatha.</p><p>She opened it.</p><p>And promptly squeaked.</p><p>Agatha stood in front of a full-length mirror, her reflection a vision of elegance. A tailored deep forest green suit hugged her frame perfectly, a crisp white blouse tucked inside. She wore high heels and her hair fell in soft waves over her shoulders. Her makeup was flawless, enhancing her already sharp features.</p><p>Caption: All set for tonight.</p><p>Rio immediately felt three inches tall.</p><p>She could not compete with that level of sophistication. She looked like she was dressed for a cute dinner date. Agatha looked like she was about to Ocean 8 a whole fortune and break hearts doing it.</p><p>Panicking slightly, she snapped a mirror selfie back—her dress, her jacket, her considerably less dangerous heels.</p><p>Caption: You look gorgeous, Agatha. I’m trying my best to keep up. See you soon</p><p>And then, in a moment of courage (or stupidity), she added a wink emoji.</p><p>Immediately, she regretted it. Who even was she? Why was she winking?!</p><p>No time to dwell. She grabbed her keys and left before she could talk herself out of the whole thing.</p><p>By the time Rio pulled up to the restaurant, her nerves were a full-blown symphony.</p><p>And then she saw her.</p><p>Agatha stood near the entrance, hands tucked into her pockets, looking like she had just stepped out of one of her movies. The glow of the restaurant’s lights gave her an almost ethereal look, and the way she was smiling—warm, genuine, like she was actually excited to see Rio—made Rio’s brain short-circuit.</p><p>This was real. This was happening.</p><p>She got out of the car, determined to be cool about it, but as she stepped forward, her heel got caught on the curb.</p><p>There was no stopping it.</p><p>One second, she was walking toward Agatha with what she hoped was an air of confidence. The next, she was flailing, making a noise that sounded very undignified as she nearly face-planted into the pavement.</p><p>Instead, she stumbled forward, straight into Agatha’s arms.</p><p>For a long second, there was silence.</p><p>Rio was mortified. She was literally being held upright by Agatha, who smelled unfairly good, like expensive perfume and a hint of something deeper, warmer, something entirely intoxicating.</p><p>Agatha chuckled, her grip steadying Rio as she helped her back to her feet. “Well, that’s one way to fall for me.”</p><p>Rio let out a strangled sound. “I…that’s illegal. You can’t just say things like that.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, looking entirely too amused. “Noted.”</p><p>Somehow, Rio survived long enough to make it inside.</p><p>The restaurant was intimate and exclusive, the kind of place where everything looked polished and expensive.</p><p>The restaurant was so fancy that Rio immediately felt out of place. The napkins looked more expensive than her rent.</p><p>But she was determined to be classy.</p><p>Sophisticated. The kind of person who belonged in a place like this.</p><p>That lasted about five minutes.</p><p>The moment the waiter set down a ridiculously expensive bottle of wine, Rio reached for her glass at the exact wrong time, knocking the bottle slightly off balance.</p><p>It wobbled.</p><p>Her soul left her body.</p><p>Agatha’s reflexes were apparently supernatural, because she reached out and steadied it before disaster struck. Then she turned to Rio, smirking.</p><p>“Planning to cause some chaos?”</p><p>Rio, utterly mortified, immediately blurted out, “I was testing your reaction time.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, amused. “And?”</p><p>“Ten out of ten. You passed.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, shaking her head. “Good to know.”</p><p>Rio spent the next five minutes gripping her wine glass like a lifeline, determined not to touch anything else.</p><p>Rio had one goal: Be normal.</p><p>Then the bread basket arrived.</p><p>Agatha, with her usual elegance, tore off a small piece and ate it like a regular human being.</p><p>Rio, in her infinite wisdom, decided to tear off a piece of bread with one hand.</p><p>Unfortunately, her brain forgot how physics worked.</p><p>The bread did not tear cleanly. Instead, she somehow managed to catapult a chunk of it directly into Agatha’s lap.</p><p>For a horrifying second, time slowed down.<br/>Rio’s eyes widened. Agatha looked down at the piece of bread now sitting politely on her thigh.</p><p>Then she looked back up, expression unreadable.</p><p>Rio, in full panic mode, saluted.</p><p>Why? Who knows.</p><p>Agatha blinked. Then, slowly—so slowly—she started laughing.</p><p>“Are you… saluting me?”</p><p>Rio groaned, covering her face. “No. I mean yes. But only because my body malfunctioned.”</p><p>Agatha plucked the bread from her lap, popped it into her mouth like it was no big deal, and grinned. “If you wanted me to try that piece so badly, you could’ve just said so.”</p><p>Rio groaned louder. “I’m leaving my own body. Goodbye.”</p><p>Agatha laughed again, shaking her head. “Please don’t. I’m actually enjoying myself.”</p><p>Rio peeked at her through her fingers. “You are?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Oh, definitely.”</p><p>The conversation was surprisingly easy. Agatha asked more about Rio’s job as a florist, listening intently as Rio described the oddest customer requests she’d ever gotten (including the time someone wanted an apology bouquet for a cat).</p><p>“Did the cat forgive them?” Agatha asked, eyes twinkling.</p><p>“I hope so,” Rio sighed. “That bouquet was expensive.”</p><p>Agatha talked about her latest film project, about the chaos of working on set, about the time an animatronic nearly took her out mid-scene.</p><p>“Not the glamorous Hollywood lifestyle I imagined,” Rio teased.</p><p>“Oh, it’s a mess,” Agatha admitted. “But a fun one.”</p><p>At one point Agatha managed to get a bit of sauce on her thumb, which she licked off in a subconscious move, one that Rio took note of.</p><p>Rio, was in the process of choking on her own spit.</p><p>She quickly smacked her chest, coughing violently, praying to every higher power that Agatha hadn’t noticed.</p><p>Spoiler: Agatha noticed.</p><p>She raised an amused eyebrow as Rio finally made her way over, still slightly wheezing.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Agatha asked, the corner of her mouth twitching.</p><p>“Oh yeah, totally,” Rio said quickly. “Just… breathing. Weirdly. You know how it is.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “I do?”</p><p>Rio had no idea what she was saying anymore.</p><p>They laughed, they ate, they shared more about their lives, their likes and dislikes. And as the night wore on, Rio forgot to be nervous.</p><p>By the time they stepped outside, the air had cooled, but Rio felt warm.</p><p>Agatha turned to her, eyes soft. “I had an amazing time tonight.”</p><p>“Me too,” Rio admitted. “I wasn’t sure what to expect, but… this was perfect, despite me embarrassing myself.”</p><p>There was a pause. A shift in the air. Agatha stepped closer, her hand brushing lightly against Rio’s arm.</p><p>Rio swallowed. Was this happening?</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, her voice teasing but quiet. “Would it be too forward if I kissed you?”</p><p>Rio almost said something dumb, like ‘Depends on the angle’ but thankfully, her brain short-circuited before she could.</p><p>Agatha leaned in, about to close the distance.</p><p>Rio’s brain shut down.</p><p>She realized, all at once, that Agatha was about to kiss her.</p><p>And in that moment, Rio panicked.</p><p>Not by pulling away. Not by saying something dumb.</p><p>No.</p><p>By shifting her weight at the exact wrong second, causing her to accidentally bump into Agatha’s shoulder instead of meeting her lips.</p><p>For a full, horrifying second, they just… stood there.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “…Did you just dodge me, did you not want me to kiss you?”</p><p>Rio immediately wanted to die. “NO! I mean yes of course I did! I didn’t mean to! My foot moved and then I—”</p><p>Agatha, looking far too amused, shook her head. “Unbelievable. I try to be romantic, and you juke me.”</p><p>“I DIDN’T JUU—”</p><p>Agatha, still smirking, gently cupped Rio’s face with both hands, effectively stopping her from any more unintentional evasive maneuvers.</p><p>“Let’s try that again,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>The kiss was soft at first, like she was savoring the moment, but when Rio responded—when she melted into it, hands finding their way to Agatha’s waist—it deepened, slow and real.</p><p>When they pulled apart, Agatha smirked. “I could get used to that.”</p><p>Rio, still breathless, let out a nervous laugh. “Trust me, I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Good. Because this is just the beginning.”</p><p>And as Rio watched her drive away, she realized she really, really hoped that was true..</p><p>As Agatha got into her car, she posted a final Snapchat story from the front seat, showing the view of the city lights outside the window.</p><p>Caption: Had an amazing night with someone special. Can’t wait to see what’s next. ❤️</p><p>Rio, her heart still racing from the night, smiled as she swiped through the story. Someone special. She felt the same way.</p>

<p>The next few days felt like a whirlwind for Rio. Every time her phone buzzed, her heart would leap in her chest, hoping it was another snap from Agatha. It had become an obsession, and she knew it. Actively acknowledged that it had been an obsession for some time now.</p><p>She couldn’t help herself.</p><p>Every time she opened Agatha's stories, she was looking for something, a new post, a new message, a clue that Agatha was just as interested as she was.</p><p>It was almost like she couldn’t believe it was happening. That someone like Agatha Harkness, who had such an enviable life, would be interested in her. It felt like a dream, and Rio was determined to enjoy every moment, even if it meant losing herself in Agatha’s world of snaps.</p><p>One evening, while scrolling through Agatha's Snapchat, Rio saw a post that made her heart race. It was a picture of Agatha standing in front of her current movie set trailer (which luckily for her was being shot locally), her hair pulled back in a loose ponytail, wearing a casual outfit that somehow looked effortlessly stylish.</p><p>Caption: Big news! Landed a new role in an exciting project I’ve been dying to share with you all. Can’t wait to dive in when filming here wraps up!</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. She couldn’t believe it. Agatha had just landed another major role. She had worked hard, and it was clear that her career was soaring. Rio’s admiration for Agatha deepened, but there was something else too, pride. She felt proud of Agatha.</p><p>Before Rio could stop herself, she quickly sent a snap chat back:</p><p>Rio: Congrats on the new role! That’s amazing, Agatha. You’re going to crush it, as always. 😘</p><p>A few moments later, Agatha replied with a snap of herself smiling widely, showing a bit of excitement.</p><p>Caption: Thank you! I’m so excited, and you’re too sweet. I’m definitely going to need someone to celebrate with! Maybe I can talk you into another date? 😉</p><p>Rio froze, her heart skipping a beat. Did Agatha just ask her out again? Was this really happening? It took Rio a second to process the message before she quickly typed out a response.</p><p>Rio: I’d love that. I’m definitely up for another date. Just tell me when and where! 😏</p><p>She hit send, then quickly held her breath, waiting for Agatha’s reply. The uncertainty of it all made her stomach flip. But when Agatha’s message came through, her heart melted.</p><p>Agatha: It’s a date then. How does Saturday sound? I’ll make it worth your while, promise. 😘</p><p>Rio smiled, her fingers tapping out a quick response without thinking.</p><p>Rio: Saturday sounds perfect. I’m looking forward to it already. 😁</p><p>As soon as she sent it, she felt a wave of relief and excitement flood through her. It was official. They were going on another date.</p><p>But even as the excitement settled in, Rio couldn’t stop watching Agatha’s Snapchat stories. It was almost like she was waiting for another piece of the puzzle to fall into place. And Agatha didn’t disappoint. She posted a mix of work-related content and more personal moments. One story showed Agatha laughing with the cast and crew on set, giving Rio a glimpse of her behind-the-scenes life.</p><p>The next post, Agatha shared a snap of her with Remi, curled up beside her in her living room.</p><p>Caption: Relaxing after a long day of filming. Remis good company, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t wishing someone else was here to keep me company</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but feel the tension in Agatha’s words. She knew the reference was to her. It had to be. Right?</p><p>And that made Rio feel both flattered and a little giddy. Agatha was clearly still thinking about her, and she was making it clear that she wanted to spend more time with her.</p><p>Rio leaned back against her bed, a smile creeping onto her face as she watched the snap. She couldn’t help but daydream about what Saturday would be like. Would Agatha kiss her again? Would they do something completely different? Maybe dinner and then a walk, just the two of them, still away from the public eye, away from everything else. Just them.</p><p>As the hours passed, Rio’s mind continued to wander, lost in thoughts of Agatha and the next time they would meet.</p><p>Saturday couldn’t come soon enough.</p><p>The week leading up to the next date felt like it lasted forever for Rio. Every day, she’d eagerly check Agatha’s Snapchat stories, hoping for a new update. Agatha’s posts became a delightful mix of sweet moments, chaotic snippets of her life, and the occasional glimpse of Bucky, who seemed to be constantly by her side.</p><p>One morning, Agatha posted a snap of her making coffee in the kitchen, her hair still messy from waking up. She had a huge mug in her hand, steam rising from it.</p><p>Caption: My morning routine: coffee, Remi and Scratchy cuddles, and pretending I have it all together</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but smile at the sight. Agatha was so down-to-earth in those moments, a further glimpse into her everyday life, and it made Rio feel even closer to her.</p><p>Later that afternoon, Agatha posted another snap, this time with Bucky who was standing next to her while they were both in the middle of a grocery store trip. Agatha was laughing, her arms full of groceries, while Bucky had a shopping cart piled high with random items—some of which didn’t seem like they belonged in the same cart at all. Agatha’s caption was classic Agatha.</p><p>Caption: Bucky’s idea of grocery shopping: Anything goes. Pray for me, please</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh at the image. It was just so real, two friends acting like complete goofs. And Bucky, always the troublemaker, seemed like someone who brought even more chaos into Agatha’s already hectic life. Rio found it oddly endearing, and she couldn’t wait to hear more about their ridiculous adventures.</p><p>That evening, Agatha posted a snap of Remi lying across her lap while she tried to get some work done at home. The snap was a cute, cozy moment, showing how Agatha balanced the demands of her career with the simple joys of life.</p><p>Caption: Remi: 1, Me: 0. Trying to work, but my daughter is demanding attention. Anyone else’s dog think they own the place?</p><p>Rio loved how Agatha was so open and unguarded in sharing these small glimpses of her life, and she couldn’t wait to actually be a part of it all. Hopefully, maybe.</p><p>The next day, Agatha posted a much more chaotic story, showing herself at a photo shoot. It was clear from the snaps that things weren’t going according to plan. Agatha was running around, in heels and a stunning dress, while the crew scrambled to adjust lighting.</p><p>Caption: The glamorous life of a movie star: Hair, makeup, and running around in heels like a chicken with its head cut off. 💁‍♀️</p><p>In another story, she showed a video of the behind-the-scenes mayhem as she accidentally knocked over a cup of coffee on set. Bucky could be heard laughing in the background as Agatha scrambled to clean it up, all while keeping her composure like a pro.</p><p>Rio couldn’t stop laughing as she watched the story. She felt like she was right there, part of the chaotic energy of Agatha’s life. Agatha in reality was so far removed from the idea of a perfect celebrity and Rio found that incredibly refreshing.</p><p>But then, something shifted. Later that week, Bucky was the one who posted something that made Rio’s stomach flutter at the sweetness of it. It was a video of Agatha and Bucky, they were lounging on a couch, Remi curled up between them. Agatha was holding a book, reading aloud to Bucky, her voice animated and warm. He’d covered the post with the caption:</p><p>Caption: Finally some downtime with Agatha and Remi. My most favourite person in the world 💕</p><p>Rio felt her heart swell. There was something about that moment—about seeing Agatha in this quiet, unguarded space—that made Rio realize just how deeply she was falling for her. She was a woman who loved deeply, cherished her friends, and valued her downtime, just like Rio did.</p><p>Then, just as Rio was lost in her thoughts, Agatha herself posted something. It was a selfie, taken at an odd angle, showing her laughing uncontrollably at something off-screen. Her eyes were bright, her cheeks rosy, and she had the kind of smile that could light up the whole room. She’d not bothered to put any caption.</p><p>There was something so authentic in that post, something real that Rio was drawn to. She wanted to see her this unguarded in person, wanted to be the one to make her face light up in laughter like that.</p><p>As the week drew to a close, Rio couldn’t stop checking Agatha’s stories. She felt more and more connected to her, and more and more eager to see her again. And as Agatha's snap story that evening popped up, showing a simple selfie in bed.</p><p>Caption: Ready for the weekend. I have a date tomorrow night which I cannot wait for!</p><p>Rio’s heart skipped. She couldn’t wait either.</p>

<p>Saturday had finally arrived, and Rio could barely contain her excitement. She had spent the entire week anticipating this moment, replaying every conversation in her head, wondering what Agatha had planned and how the evening would unfold. Would the night be as magical as their last date? Would she manage to keep her cool this time? The questions buzzed in her mind, an endless loop of nervous energy that no amount of distraction could quiet.</p><p>By mid-afternoon, she was a bundle of nerves. She spent extra time picking the perfect dress, a little black number that hugged her curves just right. She turned from side to side in the mirror, tugging at the hem, adjusting the neckline. Too much? Too little?</p><p>With a sigh, she grabbed her phone and typed out a message to Alice.</p><p>Rio: I think I’m spiraling.</p><p>Alice: Again?</p><p>Rio: YES. What if I embarrass myself again? What if she realizes I’m a disaster and regrets asking me out a second time?</p><p>Alice: Lol Rio this is the third time, coffee counts.… and hear me out… what if you relax and have a great time?</p><p>Rio: Unlikely to relax</p><p>Alice sent back a GIF of a cat dramatically collapsing onto a couch. Rio rolled her eyes but smiled. She needed to pull herself together.</p><p>Just as she was about to apply her lipstick, her phone buzzed.</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>She clicked it and was met with Bucky’s story rather than Agathas as she was expecting.</p><p>The first post was a short video. The angle was slightly tilted, capturing Agatha standing in front of a mirror. She wore a stunning purple dress, though the way she was fiddling with the sleeves suggested she wasn’t happy with it.</p><p>Bucky’s voice came from behind the camera, teasing but affectionate. “Never seen her this nervous before. This is her second outfit change.”</p><p>Rio’s heart skipped. Agatha was nervous?The idea sent a flutter of warmth through her chest.</p><p>The next snap nearly stole her breath away. Agatha had changed into a sleek black jumpsuit with a plunging neckline that left little to the imagination. She looked like she had stepped out of a fashion magazine, her glossy black heels completing the look. Bucky was clearly gushing over her.</p><p>Caption: Looking a million dollars! My girl’s dressing to impress tonight. One word - STUNNING</p><p>Rio stared at the screen, heat rising to her cheeks. She dressed up… for me?</p><p>Her nerves skyrocketed. She quickly snapped a picture of herself in the mirror, tilting her head slightly, making sure the lighting caught her at the right angle. She wasn’t sure if she looked as flawless as Agatha, but she felt good. Confident, even.Well, as confident as someone about to go on a date with Agatha freaking Harkness could be.</p><p>She hesitated for a second before posting it to her story.</p><p>Caption: Ready for my date. Hope I don’t embarrass myself again! Wish me luck!😬💚</p><p>Immediately, she tucked her phone into her purse before she could overthink it. She had a date to get to.</p><p>Unknown to Rio, across town, Agatha stood in front of the restaurant bathroom mirror, gripping the edges of the sink as she stared at her reflection. Her heart was racing.</p><p>Bucky had been relentless the entire evening.</p><p>“I can’t believe you’re this worked up,” he had teased while lounging on her couch, watching her swap out outfit after outfit. “This isn’t even your first date with her.”</p><p>“That’s exactly why it matters,” Agatha had muttered, smoothing down the fabric of the jumpsuit.</p><p>Bucky had just smirked, arms crossed. “You like her.”</p><p>Agatha had shot him a glare, but it lacked heat. “Shut up.”</p><p>Now, standing under the dim lighting of the restaurant’s bathroom, she felt her stomach twist in knots. What if I come on too strong? What if she thinks this is too much?</p><p>With a deep breath, she pulled out her phone and took a quick snap of herself in the mirror. Her smile was genuine, but she could see the nervous energy in her eyes.</p><p>Caption: Is it weird that I’m nervous for my date? Meeting up with someone special</p><p>She sent it to her story before she could second-guess herself.</p><p>Rio had just stepped out of the cab when her phone buzzed again. She checked her screen and saw Agatha’s new snap.</p><p>The sight of Agatha in the restaurant bathroom, looking effortlessly stunning yet clearly nervous made Rio’s heart pound.</p><p>She read the caption twice. She’s nervous, too.</p><p>A rush of confidence surged through her. Maybe she wasn’t the only one overthinking everything.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she smoothed down her dress and walked toward the restaurant entrance. Whatever happened tonight, she was ready.</p><p>When she stepped into the restaurant, her stomach was a tangled mess of nerves, but the second she spotted Agatha, everything else faded into the background.</p><p>Agatha was already waiting by their table, a tailored black jacket now draped over her sleek jumpsuit, making her look even more impossibly put-together. She stood when she saw Rio approaching, her lips curling into that warm, slightly mischievous smile Rio had already found herself looking forward to.</p><p>“You made it,” Agatha said, her voice laced with something soft—relief, maybe.</p><p>Rio, who had spent the entire cab ride hyping herself up, promptly forgot how words worked. “Yeah! Of course. I mean—why wouldn’t I? Not like I was gonna—uh—ditch you or anything.”</p><p>Agatha raised an amused brow, eyes twinkling as she pulled out Rio’s chair for her. “Well, that’s good to know. Would’ve been quite the ego hit if you’d stood me up.”</p><p>Rio groaned as she sat down, covering her face for a moment. Off to a great start.</p><p>“Can we pretend I didn’t just say that?”</p><p>Agatha let out a soft chuckle, sliding into her own chair across from her. “Not a chance.”</p><p>And just like that, the awkwardness melted into something easy, something light.</p><p>Dinner was Italian this time, and every part of it felt effortless. They shared plates of pasta, bickered about whether pineapple belonged on pizza (“Absolutely not,” Agatha had scoffed, to which Rio had dramatically clutched her chest in betrayal), and swapped ridiculous childhood stories.</p><p>At one point, as Agatha sipped her wine, Rio launched into an animated retelling of the time she had attempted to impress a girl in high school by pretending to be a skater.</p><p>“So there I was,” Rio said, gesturing wildly with her fork, “brand new skateboard, absolutely no ability to do anything cool. But did that stop me from attempting a sick trick in front of the girl I had a crush on?”</p><p>Agatha, already grinning, leaned in slightly. “Oh, please tell me you landed it.”</p><p>“I wish.” Rio let out a dramatic sigh. “Instead, I hit a rock, fell flat on my face, and my board rolled into the street, where it was immediately run over by a school bus.”</p><p>Agatha threw her head back with a laugh, the sound warm and unrestrained. “Oh, no. That’s tragic.”</p><p>“The worst part?” Rio shook her head. “The girl didn’t even like it. She just—sighed. Like she was embarrassed for me.”</p><p>Agatha winced sympathetically but was still clearly holding back laughter. “That’s brutal.”</p><p>“It was.” Rio pointed her fork at her. “You better not judge me.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, eyes twinkling. “Oh, I’m absolutely judging you.”</p><p>Rio groaned, slumping in her chair. “That’s fair.”</p><p>And that was the rhythm of the night—Rio being her usual slightly awkward self, and Agatha taking it all in stride, clearly entertained, clearly charmed.</p><p>There was a moment during dessert when Rio found herself staring, completely and utterly distracted as Agatha wiped a bit of cream from the corner of her mouth with her thumb. Just like last time.</p><p>She did it so absentmindedly, completely unaware of how breathtaking she looked in that second. The way the candlelight caught in her hair, the soft curve of her lips, the ease with which she carried herself—it was enough to make Rio’s heart trip over itself.</p><p>Agatha caught her staring.</p><p>“What?” she asked, tilting her head slightly.</p><p>Rio panicked. “Nothing! I mean—just—you had something on your face.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched, clearly amused. “I got it, though.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said weakly. “Yeah, you did.”</p><p>She was so down bad.</p><p>By the time dinner was over, Rio half-expected Agatha to say goodbye, maybe give her another kiss and part ways. But instead, Agatha glanced outside, where the city lights painted the streets in a warm, golden glow, and smiled.</p><p>“Want to walk for a bit?” she asked, slipping her jacket back on. “It’s a nice night.”</p><p>Rio, despite knowing that prolonging this evening meant prolonging her suffering, found herself nodding. “Yeah. That sounds… nice.”</p><p>And it was.</p><p>They strolled side by side through the quiet streets, the conversation still flowing effortlessly between them. At one point, their hands brushed, and Rio nearly short-circuited, but Agatha didn’t seem to notice—or maybe she did, she let her hand linger but moments later, when Rio didn’t take it, she casually slid her hand into the pocket of her jacket, as if stopping herself from doing something impulsive.</p><p>By the time they reached the parking lot, Rio was both exhilarated and exhausted from the constant internal battle of you idiot you should have taken her hand, you’ve messed it up, don’t make this weird, don’t make this weird, don’t…</p><p>Agatha turned to her with that soft, knowing smile. “Can I drive you home?”</p><p>Rio blinked, caught off guard. “You don’t have to do that—”</p><p>“I want to.” Agatha tilted her head, as if reading the hesitation on Rio’s face. “Unless you don’t want me to?”</p><p>Rio hesitated for only a second before exhaling. “Okay. Yeah. I’d like that.”</p><p>There was no rush to say goodbye. No eagerness to be apart. Just Agatha, looking at her like she was something precious.</p><p>And Rio, despite herself, let herself fall just a little bit more.</p><p>As soon as Rio climbed into Agatha’s G-Wagon, her heart started hammering against her ribs. It was ridiculous—she’d just spent an entire evening with Agatha, laughing, talking, completely in sync. But now, alone in the enclosed space of her car, the air felt… heavier.</p><p>She fumbled with her seatbelt, nearly missing the buckle before clicking it into place. Be cool, Rio. It’s just a car ride. People get driven home all the time. It’s fine. Normal.</p><p>Agatha started the engine after taking her address. The car smelled like her—a mix of something woody and subtly sweet, a scent Rio could drown in.</p><p>She sneaked a glance at Agatha, watching how effortlessly she moved. One hand on the wheel, the other adjusting the settings with an ease that made Rio’s brain short-circuit. Even driving, Agatha carried herself with that same quiet confidence, like she was in control of not just the car but the moment itself.</p><p>Rio, meanwhile, was not in control.</p><p>The distance between them felt almost nonexistent in the intimate space of the car. She could hear Agatha’s soft breathing, see the way her fingers flexed slightly against the wheel. It made Rio’s pulse quicken, an undeniable pull deep in her chest.</p><p>And then, before she could talk herself out of it, Rio reached over and slid her hand into Agatha’s.</p><p>It was instinctive, a quiet need for closeness that she should have taken during their walk. As soon as her fingers made contact, Rio felt a rush of warmth flood her system—oh, wow, okay, this was happening.</p><p>Agatha glanced over, eyes widening slightly, surprised but not pulling away. Instead, she simply squeezed Rio’s hand, intertwining their fingers. Her grip was firm, grounding, like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>For a moment, neither of them spoke. The silence wasn’t awkward, though it was charged, filled with something unspoken, something real.</p><p>Rio’s brain, of course, did not shut up.</p><p>Oh my god, she’s holding my hand. And she’s not letting go. Holy shit, her hand is really soft. Do I have sweaty hands? Please don’t be sweaty. Oh god, what if they’re sweaty?</p><p>Her panic was momentarily derailed by how nice it felt—Agatha’s fingers wrapped around hers, thumb tracing idle patterns over the back of her hand, a small, unconscious gesture that made Rio’s chest squeeze.</p><p>She barely thought before pulling out her phone and snapping a picture. The soft lighting of the dashboard cast a golden glow over their entwined fingers, the moment so simple yet somehow monumental.</p><p>Caption: Feels right. Can’t explain it any other way. ❤️</p><p>Rio hesitated, then turned the phone to show Agatha, suddenly worried it was too much.</p><p>Agatha looked at the picture, then at Rio. A small smile played at the corner of her lips, something warm and amused.</p><p>“I think I’d have to agree.”</p><p>And that was it. Rio was done for. Absolutely, completely done for. Ruined forever. No one else would ever be able to compare.</p><p>They were still holding hands when Agatha pulled up in front of Rio’s apartment. The engine hummed softly as the car idled, but neither of them made a move to get out.</p><p>Rio turned to Agatha, heart pounding.</p><p>“I had a really great time tonight,” Agatha said, her voice quieter now, more intimate. Like she didn’t want the night to end.</p><p>Rio swallowed, suddenly feeling like she was standing at the edge of something big. “Me too,” she whispered.</p><p>The air between them shifted.</p><p>Agatha was watching her, her gaze flicking down to Rio’s lips and back up again. There was a pull a gravitational force drawing them together.</p><p>And Rio—well, Rio wasn’t going to hesitate. Not this time.</p><p>She shifted closer, her body angling toward Agatha’s, her heart hammering in her chest.</p><p>And then she froze. Because suddenly, her brain caught up to her actions, and all at once, her thoughts thundered in her mind.</p><p>What if I’m reading this wrong? What if she doesn’t want to kiss me? Oh god, what if I miss? What if I accidentally headbutt her? Or worse, what if my lips are dry?!</p><p>She panicked.</p><p>Like, full-body seized-up gay panic.</p><p>So instead of gracefully closing the distance, Rio’s body jerked forward in the most awkward, unnatural movement known to mankind. Her hand, still resting on Agatha’s lap, slipped, and she ended up face-planting into Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>A soft thud.</p><p>A beat of silence.</p><p>Rio, still face-down against Agatha, screamed internally.</p><p>“Oh my god,” she groaned against the fabric of Agatha’s jacket. “Kill me. Just end it. I can’t live like this.”</p><p>She felt Agatha’s body shake.</p><p>Then laughter.</p><p>Warm, amused, affectionate laughter.</p><p>Agatha didn’t push her away. Didn’t make it weird. She just… laughed, a deep, rich sound that sent a whole new wave of heat through Rio’s body.</p><p>Rio slowly peeled herself off Agatha’s shoulder, mortified. “I—I was trying to—I thought I—” She exhaled sharply. “Never mind. I ruined it.”</p><p>Agatha was still grinning, eyes twinkling as she reached up and tucked a stray piece of hair behind Rio’s ear.</p><p>“I have dejavu right now but you didn’t ruin anything.” Her voice was impossibly soft. “You’re adorably awkward.”</p><p>Rio covered her face. “That is not what I was going for.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, and then—before Rio could combust entirely—she reached out, tilting Rio’s chin up ever so slightly.</p><p>“Hey,” she murmured. “Relax.”</p><p>And then she leaned in.</p><p>This time, there was no hesitation, no panic. Just warmth, softness, intent.</p><p>The kiss was slow, unhurried, filled with something deliberate. Agatha’s lips moved against Rio’s in a way that made her melt, her whole body suddenly feeling too light, too heavy, all at once.</p><p>Rio sighed into it, fingers instinctively tangling in Agatha’s jacket, her entire brain short-circuiting.</p><p>And then, just as Rio deepened the kiss, moving to push her tongue into Agathas mouth—Agatha stopped.</p><p>She pulled back, breathing a little unsteady, eyes searching Rio’s with something unreadable.</p><p>“Rio,” she whispered, her voice a little shaky. “We need to slow down.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach plummeted. Ruined it. Oh my god, I actually DID ruin it.</p><p>“I—I’m sorry,” she blurted, hands flying up as she backpedaled at record speed. “I didn’t mean to—if I misread—oh god, I made it weird, didn’t I? I made it so—”</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha’s voice was patient, amused, and Rio realized she was still smiling. Not rejecting, not upset, just… steady.</p><p>Agatha reached for her hand again, squeezing gently. “I want this, you,” she said, her tone quiet but certain. “But I don’t want to rush. This is too important to screw up.”</p><p>Rio exhaled, chest loosening. “…You mean I didn’t screw it up?”</p><p>Agatha laughed, pressing a lingering kiss to Rio’s forehead.</p><p>“No, sweetheart,” she murmured. “Not even close.”</p><p>And that, that was the moment Rio knew she was in serious trouble.</p><p>“I don’t want you to go yet.”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly, her fingers brushing Rio’s cheek in a tender touch. “I don’t want to go either.”Her voice was full of sincerity. “But let’s take this slow. We’ve got plenty of time.”</p><p>Rio nodded, a small smile tugging at her lips. She felt a little flutter of excitement, a sense of anticipation for what was to come. Agatha wanted her, but she also wanted to get things right. And Rio felt the same way.</p><p>This wasn’t just about a hot kiss or a fleeting attraction—it was about something deeper. Something that was worth taking their time over.</p><p>Agatha leaned in one last time, placing a final soft kiss on Rio’s lips. “Goodnight, Rio. I’ll see you soon,” she whispered, her voice a promise that lingered in the air between them.</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha started the car and drove away, her heart still racing. As she walked into her apartment, she couldn’t help but smile.</p><p>She was definitely, madly, obsessively in love with Agatha Harkness.</p>

<p>The next morning, Rio woke up feeling lighter, her mind still replaying every moment of the night before. The kiss. The way Agatha had looked at her. The way she had pulled back—not because she didn’t want her, but because she did. Because she wanted to do this the right way.</p><p>Rio barely had time to process it all before her phone buzzed.</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>She grabbed her phone off the nightstand, her heart doing a little flip when she saw Agatha’s name.</p><p>Agatha Harkness sent you a Snap.</p><p>Opening it, Rio found a grainy, low-lit photo of Agatha still in bed, her face half-buried in the pillow, her hair a mess. She was clearly not a morning person and the caption confirmed it:</p><p>Caption: Don’t look at me. Dont talk to me, I need Espresso first.</p><p>Rio let out a soft laugh, rolling onto her back as she typed out a response:</p><p>Rio: Noted. How about I just admire you from afar, then?</p><p>She hesitated for a second before snapping a mirror selfie from her bed, still tangled in the sheets, her messy hair giving off the same half-asleep energy Agatha had in her pic. It wasn’t overly flirty, but it wasn’t not flirty either.</p><p>Agatha opened it almost immediately, then sent back a short video, her, dramatically sipping her espresso with narrowed eyes before sighing in relief.</p><p>“Okay. You have my attention, you may now speak."</p><p>Rio laughed again, already feeling like her day was off to a ridiculously good start.</p><p>The rest of the morning was a steady back-and-forth of snaps - Agatha documenting her chaotic attempt at making breakfast (while Remi begged and stole from the side), Rio sending a picture of her flower shop.</p><p>Caption: Back to my humble life of selling pretty things</p><p>Agatha responded with a zoomed-in photo of a half-dead plant in her kitchen.</p><p>Caption: Please save him</p><p>Rio sent back a chat message as a response:</p><p>Rio: Even celebrities can’t keep houseplants alive???</p><p>Agatha: I can keep a career alive and my pets. That’s enough</p><p>By midday, Agatha had started posting more to her Snapchat story and Rio, as she had fully accepted by now, watched and replayed them like a woman obsessed.</p><p>One snap showed Bucky laid out on Agatha’s couch, mouth open, blanket half on the floor.</p><p>Caption: Please admire from a distance</p><p>Another was a chaotic clip of Remi barking at her own reflection, Agatha’s voice deadpan in the background:</p><p>“Madam. It’s you. The call is coming from inside the house."</p><p>Then, of course, there was one of Señor Scratchy, sitting judgmentally on her kitchen counter while Agatha looked to be meal prepping.</p><p>Caption: Even the rabbit judges me. Bettayal</p><p>But in between all the funny, chaotic posts, there were the more personal ones, the glimpses of Agatha’s real life that made Rio’s heart squeeze in ways she now anticipated when viewing anything that showed Agathas softer side.</p><p>One snap was a photo of a script with a heart emoji covering the name, a coffee cup sitting beside it with her handwritten notes scribbled in the margins.</p><p>Caption: Top secret new script! Work mode activated.</p><p>Another was a mirror selfie, taken from what looked like a personal dressing room. Agatha’s hair was back, her makeup minimal, her eyes a little tired but still shining.</p><p>Caption: Long day ahead. Wish me luck</p><p>Rio did wish her luck. And when Agatha sent her private snap later—a picture of her back home, still in the same clothes, sprawled out on the couch looking exhausted, Rio felt a strange kind of protectiveness, she wanted to be there with her.</p><p>Caption: Survived</p><p>Rio sent back a picture of the prettiest bouquet she’d created that day:</p><p>Caption: If you were here, I’d give you this. Consider this a virtual ‘You Did Amazing’ award. 💐</p><p>Agatha’s reply was immediate. A simple selfie, soft smile, messy hair, a warmth in her eyes that sent Rio’s heart flipping over itself.</p><p>Caption: You’re trouble, Rio</p><p>Rio grinned at her screen, her heart hammering against her ribs.</p><p>She definitely had it bad. She wanted this woman. So much.</p><p>The next afternoon, Rio was knee-deep in flower arrangements when her phone buzzed again. Another Snapchat direct from Agatha.</p><p>She wiped her hands on her apron before grabbing her phone, already grinning as she opened the snap.</p><p>It was a picture of Agatha sitting outside in a garden, sunglasses perched on top of her head, Remis head resting on her lap as she scratched behind her ears.</p><p>Caption: Okay, hear me out—nature date. Hiking, fresh air, questionable choices. You in?</p><p>Rio felt a thrill rush through her. They’d done coffee. They’d done the two fancy dinners. But this? This was different. More casual, more personal.</p><p>Agatha sent another snap before Rio could respond, this time of Remi’s face as she stared out into the tree-line, ears perked up.</p><p>Caption: Also, my daughter would like to attend. She insists</p><p>Rio laughed, shaking her head before snapping a picture of a cluster of wildflowers near the shop’s entrance.</p><p>Caption: I mean… a date with you and Remi? How could I possibly say no? When are we doing this?</p><p>Agatha sent a video this time, her holding, Remi, speaking in an overly serious tone.</p><p>“Tomorrow. Noon. Bring appropriate shoes. And snacks. This is survival, Rio. We must be prepared."</p><p>Rio sent back a dramatic salute emoji before typing,</p><p>Rio: Got it. Also, where are we hiking? Because if I risk getting lost in the woods with you, at least let me prepare myself</p><p>Agatha replied almost instantly.</p><p>Agatha: Oh, don’t worry. If we get lost, I’ll carry you out over my shoulder like a heroic lesbian in a period drama</p><p>Rio snorted, biting her lip.</p><p>Rio: I will hold you to that</p><p>Then another message came through.</p><p>Agatha: Also… maybe after, you could come back to mine? No pressure, just… hang out. Get some food. Meet Señor Scratchy in person, if you're lucky</p><p>Rio’s heart skipped.</p><p>This was something new. Agatha was inviting her into her space. Into her home.</p><p>She took a moment before responding, wanting to play it cool even though her brain was just screaming: SHE WANTS ME TO COME OVER. TO HER ACTUAL HOUSE.</p><p>Rio: I’d love that.</p><p>Agatha sent back a simple heart emoji. And just like that, Rio’s entire day was made.</p><p>That evening, as Rio curled up on her couch, still buzzing from their conversation, she instinctively opened Snapchat, already knowing whose story she was about to re-watch like it was a tv show.</p><p>Agatha had posted again.</p><p>The first snap was a selfie. Agatha standing in her kitchen with her hair in a messy bun, wearing an oversized sweatshirt that had clearly been through multiple washes and probably belonged to Bucky at some point, glasses perched on her face.</p><p>Caption: Cleaning mode activated. Don’t be fooled, I watch a lot of cleaning tiktoks</p><p>Rio grinned, watching the next snap—a video this time. The camera panned across Agatha’s living room, where Remi was lounging on the couch, looking completely unbothered, while Agatha’s voice narrated dramatically:</p><p>“One of us is preparing our house for a visitor who they want to impress. The other is a freeloader who does not contribute to this household in any way.”</p><p>The next video showed Agatha attempting to vacuum but Remi kept chasing the machine like it was her mortal enemy, barking at it like it had personally wronged her.</p><p>“I am fighting for my life here. Remi please, mama needs this house clean.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know what Agatha meant, her house looked spotless anyway.</p><p>Then came a picture of her kitchen counter where some actual ingredients were laid out.</p><p>Caption: I’m about to cook. Groundbreaking I know</p><p>Rio laughed, shaking her head as the snaps continued. Agatha documented her struggle in real time, a snap of her staring in horror at a piece of raw chicken, another one of her Googling how long to marinade and then finally a victorious photo of a dish wrapped in clingfilm.</p><p>Caption: This better taste amazing</p><p>Then came another short video of Agatha, stirring something in a pot, a smug little smile on her face.</p><p>“Look at me. Domestic. A homemaker. A provider."</p><p>The camera zoomed in on Señor Scratchy, who was sitting on a cushion on the counter giving her the most judgmental rabbit stare ever.</p><p>“Okay, fine, I used too much salt, but we’re learning."</p><p>Rio’s chest felt warm watching all of it. She didn’t know why this made her heart race more than the expensive restaurant dates or the way Agatha flirted with her over snaps. But there was something so endearing about seeing Agatha like this, messy, normal, preparing for their date in her own chaotic way.</p><p>And the best part.</p><p>Rio would be with her in that space tomorrow.</p>

<p>The next day, Rio drove out to the hiking spot Agatha had sent her the co-ordinates for, the excitement thrumming in her veins making her feel ridiculous. It was just a nature date, just a casual hike, but knowing Agatha, nothing about today would be normal.</p><p>Her phone buzzed.</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>Agatha Harkness sent you a Snap.</p><p>She opened it while sitting in her car, grinning at the sight. It was a video of Agatha standing next to Remi, both of them looking way too serious. Agatha wore sunglasses and an all-black athletic outfit.</p><p>“We are ready. We are prepared. We are about to conquer nature."</p><p>The camera panned to Remi, who was literally vibrating with excitement, tail wagging so hard her whole body shook.</p><p>“Well, one of us is prepared. The other is an unpredictable agent of chaos, just to warn you."</p><p>Rio laughed and sent back a selfie, showing herself in her own hiking gear, leggings, a tank top, and a flannel tied around her waist.</p><p>Caption: Reporting for duty. Please don’t let your daughter kill me!</p><p>Meeting up in person still made Rio’s stomach flip but the moment Agatha saw her, she grinned like a kid who just spotted a best friend on the playground.</p><p>"Look at you!" Agatha said, giving Rio an appreciative once-over before pulling her into a quick hug, placing a kiss against her cheek. "You really committed to the hiking aesthetic. I’m proud."</p><p>"Figured I should dress for survival," Rio teased.</p><p>Agatha smirked. "You assume I’d let anything happen to you. Foolish. I will fight a bear if I need to."</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. "Bold of you to assume you’d win against the bear."</p><p>Agatha just grinned. "I have a plan. It involves distraction, Remi, and a well-placed protein bar.”</p><p>Their banter continued as they set off on the trail, the peaceful atmosphere of nature clashing spectacularly with Remi, who was having the time of her life. She zoomed ahead, chased butterflies, and nearly tripped Agatha twice.</p><p>Naturally, Agatha shared some of the chaos to her snapchat.</p><p>A video of Remi darting through a field like a madman:</p><p>“Nature’s most majestic creature. No thoughts, just vibes."</p><p>A photo of Rio, back to the camera, standing on a rock, arms crossed like she was contemplating life:</p><p>Caption: She regrets agreeing to this</p><p>A clip of Agatha dramatically wiping sweat off her brow, “We are two hours in. Supplies are running low. Morale is questionable. No, I will not check the map.”</p><p>Rio snorted and took her own snap, Agatha pointing at something in the distance, side profile only so you couldn’t see her face, while Remi tugged at her leash in the opposite direction.</p><p>Caption: A fearless leader. And a woman trying to not get us lost</p><p>The moment disaster struck, Rio wasn’t even looking.</p><p>One second, everything was fine, Agatha was ahead of her, making some ridiculous joke about being an explorer in uncharted lands and then — SPLASH.</p><p>Rio’s head snapped up just in time to see Agatha face-down in a shallow stream, water splashing up around her while Remi pranced around the edges, barking excitedly like she had just conquered a great foe.</p><p>Rio’s laugh exploded out of her before she could help it. "Oh my god, are you okay?"</p><p>Agatha pushed herself up, completely soaked, blinking in disbelief before looking up at Rio like a betrayed heroine.</p><p>“I have been attacked."</p><p>"You tripped!"</p><p>"I WAS BETRAYED!"</p><p>Rio gasped for air between laughs, pulling out her phone as Agatha dramatically flopped back into the water like a fish, hair floating around her.</p><p>Snapchat was already open.</p><p>She recorded a video of Agatha floating in two inches of water, arms spread out like she was about to ascend to the heavens.</p><p>“RIP to my date. Taken too soon by the cruel forces of nature and her own dog.”</p><p>Agatha opened one eye, lifting her face slightly above the water, concealed by the veil of her hair. "Tell them I went down fighting."</p><p>Rio cackled, snapping another picture—Agatha sitting up now, back to her, hair dripping, looking like a drowned cat.</p><p>Caption: Survivor of The Great Stream Betrayal. 2025</p><p>Agatha sighed. "Remi, you absolute fool of a dog, why would you do this to me?"</p><p>Remi just wagged her tail, clearly thrilled by the chaos.</p><p>They ended up sitting on a dry rock while Agatha attempted to wring out her clothes, muttering dramatically the whole time.</p><p>"So," Rio teased, smirking. "Still think you could take a bear?"</p><p>Agatha paused, looked down at herself, soaked and defeated and exhaled.</p><p>"I may have overestimated my abilities."</p><p>By the time they made it back to Agatha’s car, the Snapchat chaos had reached peak levels.</p><p>Bucky had  replied to one of Agatha’s posts.</p><p>Bucky 🏴‍☠️: LMAO I CANNOT BREATHE.<br/>Bucky 🏴‍☠️: Remi saw an opportunity and took it. QUEEN</p><p>Agatha had simply responded with a photo of herself, *drenched and unimpressed.</p><p>Caption. You’re dead to me</p><p>Rio, of course, posted her own contribution, a picture of Remi looking way too pleased with herself.</p><p>Caption: Today’s MVP: The agent of chaos herself</p><p>And then, in a more private moment, Agatha nudged Rio’s arm, smirking.</p><p>"Well, you survived a chaotic nature date. I think that means you’ve officially earned dinner at my place."</p><p>Rio smiled, feeling that familiar warmth rush through her.</p><p>"Only if I get to officially meet Señor Scratchy."</p><p>Agatha laughed. "Deal."</p><p>And as they climbed into their cars, dripping, exhausted, but laughing, Rio realized that this might have been the most fun she’d had in a long, long time.</p><p>Following behind Agatha’s G-Wagon, Rio couldn’t help but feel a mix of nerves and excitement curling in her stomach. This was  new territory, going to Agatha’s home, stepping into her personal space. Their dates had been nice, chaotic, and playful, but this? This was intimate in a way that made her heart hammer in her chest.</p><p>As they approached a gated community, Rio's eyebrows lifted. The entrance was guarded, the kind of place where you couldn’t just stroll in uninvited. The security booth had two guards, one of whom waved as Agatha rolled her window down.</p><p>"Evening, Miss Harkness," the guard greeted. "Bringing home a stray?"</p><p>Agatha snorted, glancing at Rio through her side mirror, a smirk playing on her lips. "This one’s special, Martin. Be nice."</p><p>The security gate opened, and Rio followed Agatha’s G-Wagon down a winding private road, passing massive, stunning houses, each with perfectly manicured lawns and long driveways. Everything about the place screamed wealth and privacy which made sense, Agatha was one of the biggest actresses in the world.</p><p>But it still hit different seeing it in person.</p><p>Agatha pulled into her driveway, and Rio had to physically stop her jaw from dropping. The house was gorgeous,  modern but cozy, warm lighting spilling through the tall windows, a mix of dark wood and sleek black accents that somehow still felt lived-in.</p><p>She barely had time to take it all in before Agatha hopped out of her car and walked over to Rio’s, tapping on her window.</p><p>"You coming in, or are you just gonna sit there and admire my impeccable taste from a distance?"</p><p>Rio snorted, rolling her eyes as she got out of the car. "Your ego is out of control."</p><p>Agatha smirked. "And yet, here you are."</p><p>With that, she grabbed Rio’s hand, interlacing their fingers as though she’d done it a thousand times and led her inside.</p><p>Inside, the house was even more stunning —a perfect blend of luxury and personality. Plush furniture, soft lighting, a few scattered script pages on the coffee table and in the corner of the living room?</p><p>A giant dog bed, clearly owned by Remi.</p><p>Speaking of— Remi galloped in like a small horse, tail wagging, sniffing at Rio before flopping dramatically at her feet.</p><p>"Remi approves of you being here," Agatha said, watching as the dog nudged at Rio’s leg. "That’s a good sign."</p><p>Rio laughed, scratching behind Remis ears. "I feel honored."</p><p>Agatha guided her through the open-plan kitchen, where sleek black cabinets met a marble island big enough to host a cooking show, then past the living room, where floor-to-ceiling windows overlooked a backyard straight out of a magazine.</p><p>"Wait, is that a pool?" Rio asked, stepping closer to the glass doors.</p><p>Agatha grinned. "It is. Heated, too." She leaned against the counter, arms crossed. "I’ll take full credit for designing the backyard, but mostly I just wanted a place to drink wine in the hot tub."</p><p>Rio chuckled, still absorbing everything. "This place is… incredible. But it’s so you."</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. "Messy but charming?"</p><p>"Exactly."</p><p>They wandered through the hallway, where Agatha pointed out different rooms—her home office, a cozy guest room, another door she jokingly called 'The Forbidden Closet of Doom', until they reached the staircase and went up to her bedroom.</p><p>Agatha stopped at the doorway, tilting her head. "Want to see the inner sanctum, or should I keep some mystery alive?"</p><p>Rio smirked. "I feel like that ship sailed the moment I watched you fall into a stream."</p><p>Agatha laughed, pushing the door open.</p><p>The bedroom was exactly what Rio expected from the glimpses in her posts and somehow not at all, a massive bed with plush blankets, soft golden light filtering through the windows, books stacked on the bedside table, and a play enclosure in the corner.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened as a familiar little creature twitched its nose at her.</p><p>"Señor Scratchy," she whispered. "It’s an honor."</p><p>Agatha grinned, walking over to scratch the rabbit’s ears. "He’s very selective about who he likes. Let’s see if you pass the test."</p><p>Rio crouched, holding out her hand, and to her delight, Señor Scratchy hopped over and gave her a sniff before nudging her fingers.</p><p>Agatha gasped dramatically. "Betrayal. He never likes new people this fast."</p><p>Rio grinned. "Guess I’m just special."</p><p>After the tour, they ended up back in the kitchen**, where Agatha pulled out a bottle of wine and the chicken she’d been marinading the day before.</p><p>"Drink?" she asked, already grabbing two glasses.</p><p>"Sure," Rio said, leaning against the counter, watching as Agatha poured.</p><p>There was something different about this moment. The air between them felt charged, heavier than before. Maybe it was the warm lighting or the quiet intimacy of being alone in Agatha’s house, or maybe it was just that Rio had been thinking about kissing her since their last date. Had had to physically stop herself while they were out hiking from grabbing her.</p><p>Agatha handed her a glass, then paused, looking at Rio in a way that made her heart stutter.</p><p>"You’re staring," Rio murmured, delighting in the blush that rose on her cheeks at the comment.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, lips twitching into a smirk but her voice was softer when she said, “Yeah. I am."</p><p>Before Rio could overthink it, Agatha set down her wine and took a step closer, fingers brushing against Rio’s wrist.</p><p>"Is this okay?" Agatha asked, voice low.</p><p>Rio barely managed to breathe out, “Yeah."</p><p>That was all it took—Agatha crowded her against the kitchen island, closing the distance, her lips pressing against Rio’s in a way that was soft but confident, teasing but deep enough to make Rio’s knees feel weak.</p><p>Rio let her hands slide up Agatha’s arms, gripping her shoulders as she kissed back, letting herself sink into the feeling of Agatha’s warmth, her scent, the way she kissed like she had all the time in the world.</p><p>Then, Agatha’s hands found Rio’s waist, pulling her flush against her, deepening the kiss just enough that Rio felt the edges of her self-control start to fray.</p><p>The counter dug into Rio’s back, and she didn’t care, all she cared about was the way Agatha’s fingers tightened against her, the way she nipped at Rio’s lower lip before pulling back just enough to whisper against her mouth.</p><p>"God, I’ve been dreaming about this."</p><p>Rio let out a breathless laugh, hands still tangled in Agatha’s shirt. "Took you long enough, I’ve been waiting for you to do that all day."</p><p>Agatha chuckled, resting her forehead against Rio’s for a second before sighing. "You’re gonna be trouble, aren’t you?"</p><p>Rio smirked. "Hmmm."</p><p>Agatha just grinned, kissed her again, and muttered, “Good.”.</p>

<p>The next morning, Rio woke up feeling warm, happy, overwhelmed in the best possible way and maybe a little smug. Last night had been a lot, in the most amazing way. The kisses, the way Agatha had looked at her, the way they had curled up on the couch afterward, just talking, sipping wine, and stealing lazy contact in between conversation.</p><p>Now, she was lounging by Agatha’s pool, legs stretched out on a cushioned sunbed, the heat of the morning sun soaking into her skin wearing nothing but one of Agathas T-Shirts. Agatha was beside her, equally relaxed, one hand entwined with Rio’s fingers. Glasses on (and didn’t that do something to Rios heart rate) reading her script.</p><p>It was quiet. Peaceful. And Rio didn’t want to be anywhere else.</p><p>She glanced at their hands, Agatha’s fingers curled so naturally between hers, and without thinking too hard about it, she lifted her phone and snapped a picture, just their hands, fingers intertwined, resting against Rio’s bare thigh. Pool in the background.</p><p>Caption: ☀️🌊💛</p><p>It wasn’t a big declaration. Just a little something for her story. A test, maybe. A way to see if Agatha would object (even though she hadn’t objected to a very similar photo on their last date).</p><p>She posted it to her Snapchat story, then locked her phone and let her head tip back against the sunbed.</p><p>A moment later, Agatha shifted, glancing over at Rio’s phone with a lazy smirk.</p><p>"Did you just sort of soft-launch me?"</p><p>Rio snorted, biting her lip. "Maybe."</p><p>Agatha hummed, seemingly unbothered, stretching her legs out further. "Ballsy of you."</p><p>"Would you rather I delete it?"</p><p>Agatha smirked, eyes closing again. "Nah."</p><p>The peace and serenity were f a poolside lounge didn’t last long.</p><p>Because ten minutes later, Rio’s phone buzzed and when she checked, she saw that she had one new message.</p><p>From Bucky.</p><p>Bucky: 👀👀👀</p><p>Bucky: EXPLAIN. RIGHT NOW.</p><p>Agathas phone also started buzzing.</p><p>Bucky: AGATHA. WAKE UP. I KNOW YOU’RE NEXT TO HER</p><p>Rio snorted nudging Agatha’s arm with her elbow. "Bucky’s having a meltdown."</p><p>Agatha groaned, rolling over and reaching for her phone. Within seconds, her own Snapchat was opened and a video sent in response to her best friends drama filled messages. A sleepy, half-hearted glare aimed at the camera as she mumbled:</p><p>“Barnes, eat my ass.”</p><p>Rio was dying, but Bucky wasn’t done.</p><p>Bucky: I KNEW IT.</p><p>Bucky: I SAW THE SIGNS. I SAW THE LOOKS.</p><p>Bucky: WAIT. ARE YOU DATING OR JUST FLIRTING? I NEED DETAILS. RIGHT NOW.</p><p>Agatha, still sun dazed, rolled onto her side and pressed her face into Rio’s stomach with a groan.</p><p>"Block him for me," she muttered.</p><p>Rio laughed, taking the opportunity to run her fingers through Agatha’s messy curls. "Not a chance. This is way too fun."</p><p>Over the next few hours,Rio and Agatha continued the game, posting cryptic snaps to their stories that gave absolutely nothing away but just enough to keep people guessing.</p><p>Agatha posted a photo of her coffee mug next to Rios mug.</p><p>Caption: Sunday mornings are better like this."*</p><p>Rio retaliated with a boomerang of Remi flopping onto her lap, adding:</p><p>“She’s a terrible guard dog, by the way."</p><p>Meanwhile, Bucky’s Snapchat story had become a conspiracy board, filled with screenshots of their snaps, captions like:</p><p>Y’all. I am INVESTED.</p><p>Agatha said she’d never soft launch a relationship, but here we are</p><p>Do I approve? Do I panic? Do I plan the wedding?!</p><p>Agatha finally broke and messaged him directly.</p><p>Agatha: If you don’t stop, I’m uninviting you from movie night and taking my house key off of you</p><p>Bucky: YOU CAN’T SCARE ME. I HAVE SCREENSHOTS.</p><p>Agatha: I’m muting you now.</p><p>Bucky: COWARD.</p><p>Rio was doubled over laughing at this point, but what made her heart stutter was the fact that Agatha didn’t seem to care about the speculation from her best friends drama.</p><p>She was having fun with it.</p><p>This felt real.</p><p>Later that evening, after a long, lazy day swimming, lounging, and expertly dodging Bucky’s continued onslaught of nosy messages,Rio and Agatha found themselves curled up on Agatha’s couch.</p><p>The TV was on, but neither of them were really watching. Agatha was absentmindedly twisting a strand of Rio’s hair around her fingers and Rio was trying very, very hard not to read too much into still being in Agathas house over 24 hours later.</p><p>Because this felt like more than just casual flirting. It felt natural. Easy. Like they had known each other for years instead of just weeks (in person - they had technically known each other and being conversing for three months).</p><p>And yet, they hadn’t actually talked about what this was.</p><p>That little voice in Rio’s head, the one that liked to whisper warnings, that reminded her how many times she had gotten too invested in something that wasn’t real, that she was a weirdo who clung too tightly too quickly, was starting to get louder.</p><p>So she took a breath, swallowed her nerves and asked, “What are we doing?”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers stilled in her hair. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, but she forced herself to keep going. “I mean is this just fun? A fling? Or do you actually want something more?”</p><p>She hadn’t meant for it to sound so serious ( again, too deep, too soon) but there it was—out in the open, buzzing in the air between them.</p><p>Agatha was quiet for a second, her eyes searching Rio’s face like she was weighing her words carefully.</p><p>Then, finally, she sighed and sat up a little, shifting so they were face to face, ocean blue eyes seeming to stare deep into Rios soul. “I wouldn’t have invited you here, into my home,  if I just wanted a fling.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched. “You wouldn’t?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, a smile tugging at her lips. “No, Rio. I actually like you. Like, really like you.”</p><p>The weight that Rio hadn’t even realized she’d been carrying lifted instantly, leaving her feeling giddy and weightless.</p><p>Still, she had to tease, just a little. “So, what you’re saying is… you’re obsessed with me?”</p><p>Agatha huffed a laugh, rolling her eyes. “I take it back. I hate you.”</p><p>Rio grinned but before she could respond, Agatha was already leaning in, brushing her lips against hers, soft and slow, like a silent promise.</p><p>After their conversation, Rio felt the rush of emotions settle inside her chest. Agatha didn’t just want this to be casual. She wanted something more. That knowledge made her heart skip a beat, and she found herself grinning like a fool.</p><p>But she also knew that subtlety was key. She wasn’t going to make any big declarations yet. So, she snapped a picture of her feet stretched out on the couch, no faces, just a little glimpse of her afternoon. Agatha’s presence in the background inly evidenced by half her arm showing thrown around Rios waist.</p><p>She posted it to her own Snapchat story.</p><p>Caption: Sunday vibes ☕💛</p><p>The picture was vague, just enough to make people wonder, was she still hanging out with someone? Whose was the gorgeous house she was in? It was the perfect balance of mystery and hint that someone had decided to take a chance on her, was with her.</p><p>A few minutes later, Rio checked her phone again, and she saw that Agatha had posted to her story, just for her and a handful of close friends. It wasn’t public, not like Rio’s story.</p><p>Agatha’s post was just a picture of Remi, sprawled lazily across Rio’s lap, her eyes half-shut in the glow of the soft afternoon light.</p><p>Caption: When the dog picks the guest over me… I’ve been betrayed</p><p>It made Rio smile, a little flutter in her chest as she typed back a quick response to Agatha’s story, even though she was laid out on her couch and Agatha was only a few rooms away.</p><p>Rio: She’s a traitor</p><p>A few minutes later, Agatha replied with a smirking selfie, sending it straight to Rio’s chat. Her face was soft,  looking effortlessly gorgeous.</p><p>Agatha: Don’t make me fight you for her</p><p>Rio laughed softly, feeling warmth spread through her chest at how easy this all felt.</p><p>But it wasn’t long before Bucky started sending questioning messages again. This time direct to Rio instead of to his best friend.</p><p>Bucky: So... y’all are having fun, huh?</p><p>Bucky: You two soft launching or what? Need a hint for the paparazzi?"</p><p>Rio smirked at the screen. Bucky’s was never subtle, but it was kind of funny that he was spying from the sidelines, that was usually Rio.</p><p>Rio: We’re just vibing. Nothing to see here. Go back to planning your next karaoke night</p><p>Bucky: I know what I saw. I’m an expert, ok? You can’t hide this from me</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, tossing her phone on the couch. She could hear Bucky’s over-the-top antics already, as if he was already planning to tell the world every single detail ( of course he wouldn’t) , even though neither of them had made anything official yet.</p><p>But what surprised her was that Agatha didn’t mind.</p><p>She wasn’t worried about Buckys questions. She didn’t seem to care about being seen by her friends and family. It wasn’t about image, it was about what they shared between them.</p><p>Even now, as Rio checked her phone again, replaying Agatha’s snap stories, which were just sweet little glimpses of their time together, a quiet moment with Remi curled up by her side and the soft click of their wine glasses clinking together. Nothing flashy. Nothing public. Just theirs.</p><p>She glanced down at her phone, and as Agatha’s latest snap story popped up—Remi wagging her tail on Rio’s lap, her face absent from the frame but her laugh clearly audible—Rio felt a wave of contentment wash over her.</p><p>As Rio drove home that night, Agatha reluctantly informing her she had a talk show appearance that night, the warmth from the weekend still lingered. The hours (and night and then another day)  spent with Agatha felt like they’d flown by, like a dream she didn’t want to wake up from. She smiled to herself as she glanced at the picture of her and Agatha’s intertwined hands still sitting in her gallery.</p><p>The memory of Agatha’s soft laugh, her teasing glances, and that heated kiss goodbye was enough to make Rio feel giddy all over again.</p><p>But, as the miles stretched on, Rio found her mind slipping into quiet reflection. Was this too much too soon? Was she rushing into something, or was it as real as it felt? She hadn’t expected this weekend to turn into anything other than a fun few days, but now… now, she was not so sure.</p><p>A few hours home, her phone buzzed in her lap, breaking her out of her thoughts. It was a snap from Agatha.</p><p>She opened it with a grin.</p><p>Agatha had sent her a video behind-the-scenes vibes before the talk show. It was a quick video, showing Agatha standing backstage at a busy set. She was in full glam, hair done in perfect waves, wearing a sleek black dress that shimmered under the studio lights. In the background, the faint sound of people hustling about, preparing for the show, was audible.</p><p>But what caught Rio’s attention was the brief moment when Agatha glanced at the camera, her smile a little softer, like she was thinking of someone in particular. Rio’s heart skipped.</p><p>She responded with a snap of her own, her face grinning brightly.</p><p>Caption: Looking amazing as always. Knock 'em dead, superstar. 💫”</p><p>She hit send and tried to push the growing excitement aside,</p><p>Later that night, Rio tuned into the talk show. She didn’t want to seem like she was stalking Agatha, or was already the overly obsessed girlfriend ( especially when they’d not actually defined their relationship) but how could she not watch when she had only been with her a fee hours ago.</p><p>Agatha was stunning on stage, her charisma was undeniable as she answered questions about her new projects, her acting career, and everything else she had going on. But, as the interview progressed, the host, clearly wanting to dig a little deeper, asked about Agatha’s personal life.</p><p>"So, Agatha, you’ve always been very private when it comes to your relationships," the host said, their voice teasing. "Is there anyone special in your life right now?"</p><p>For a split second, Agatha hesitated, and Rio couldn’t help but notice the way she adjusted in her seat, a little smile playing at her lips.</p><p>“I’ve learned over the years to keep some things for myself,” Agatha replied with a soft laugh. “But I’ll admit, there’s someone who’s been keeping me company lately."</p><p>The way Agatha said it, so casual yet so undeniably intimate, sent a wave of warmth through Rio. She couldn’t help but grin to herself. It was the first time Agatha had said something so openly in front of a crowd.</p><p>The host didn’t press further, seemingly satisfied with the response, but Agatha was still smiling when they switched topics. Rio couldn’t help but replay the moment in her mind. Someone keeping her company - was that her?</p><p>The thought made her heart race just a little faster.</p><p>As the show wrapped up and the credits rolled, Rio checked her phone once again.</p><p>Agatha had posted something else, another snap from behind the scenes after the show ended. It was a quick, candid shot of Agatha sitting in her dressing room, wiping off her makeup. Her hair was now a little messy from the show, her face relaxed and more natural than the glammed-up version from the talk show. She looked so… genuine.</p><p>Caption: And that’s a wrap. It was fun, but I’m so ready to crawl into bed with Remi</p><p>Rio smiled, feeling a warm connection even in these quiet moments. She’d been in that bed last night, had thoroughly enjoyed herself in that same bed.</p><p>She swiped to reply.</p><p>Rio: You looked incredible. Remis a lucky girl</p><p>Seconds later, Agatha’s reply came through.</p><p>Agatha: Thank you - I was a lucky girl last night so cant complain</p><p>Rio chuckled to herself, loving the playful, easy vibe they had.</p><p>She could not wait to be back in Agathas bed.</p>

<p>The next few days felt like an emotional rollercoaster for Rio—each moment filled with a mixture of nervous anticipation and a lingering sense of excitement. She found herself checking her phone constantly, her eyes scanning for any new messages or snaps from Agatha. Sometimes it was a glimpse of her current set, a peek into the world Agatha inhabited—one that was so different from Rio’s own. Other times, it was something more personal, just Agatha at home in her element, sexy glasses and Remi included, that made Rio’s heart flutter. Each snap was like a thread slowly weaving them closer, connecting them in ways that made her feel both comforted and on edge at the same time.</p><p>But there was one thing that kept playing on repeat in Rio’s mind: When will they go out again?</p><p>She wasn’t the type to sit back and wait around for things to happen. Usually, when she liked someone, she went for it, took the lead. But with Agatha, there was this subtle tension. Things were building between them, and Rio couldn’t help how much she wanted this thing between them to grow and deepen. And yet, despite that, there was a nagging uncertainty in the pit of her stomach. Was it too soon to ask to see her again? Would she put Agatha off? Would Agatha realise that Rio was not worthy of being with her?</p><p>The thought of waiting for Agatha to make the next move though felt unbearable. She had to take control, had to make it happen. She couldn’t risk losing this connection. She wasn’t going to sit idly by, second-guessing herself any longer.</p><p>That evening, after a long day spent tending to flowers and customers at the shop, Rio slumped onto her couch, exhaustion washing over her. But as soon as she picked up her phone, the thought of Agatha sparked a fresh wave of energy.</p><p>She scrolled through their past conversations—texts filled with shared jokes, hints of deeper connections, and moments of unspoken understanding. Her thumb hovered over the screen, her heart racing with the thought of what was to come.</p><p>Just send it, she told herself, taking a deep breath. The butterflies were back, swirling in her stomach, making her fingers tremble slightly. She wasn’t usually the kind to second-guess herself, but this felt different. She could almost hear the voice of doubt whispering in her ear, What if she had her weekend of fun and now doesn’t care? What if she’s not interested in seeing me again?</p><p>But Rio shook it off. She had to push past the anxiety.</p><p>Her fingers flew over the keys as she typed:</p><p>Rio: So, I was thinking... how about a date tomorrow night? I take you out somewhere this time?</p><p>She stared at the message for a moment, unsure if it sounded too eager or too casual. She bit her lip, waiting for the voice of reason to chime in. When it didn’t, she pressed send before she could talk herself out of it.</p><p>The minutes stretched, each one longer than the last, as she stared at the screen, waiting for the familiar three little dots to appear, signaling Agatha’s response. Rio’s heart thudded in her chest. What if she says no?</p><p>Finally, her phone buzzed.</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>Agatha: That sounds amazing. What do you have in mind?</p><p>Rio’s heart skipped a beat. It was like an immediate relief, a weight lifting off her shoulders. She wasn’t sure exactly what she wanted, but she had to make it special. This wasn’t just about doing something. It was about her being the one to make the effort this time.</p><p>Think, think, think she urged herself. Her eyes darted around the room, as if the right idea would just appear. Then it hit her.</p><p>Rio: I was thinking maybe a place that’s a bit less upscale, more cozy? I’ve heard of a great Thai restaurant. How does that sound?</p><p>She stared at the screen after hitting send, replaying her words in her mind. Was it too casual? Would she want something more fancy, like the restaurants she’d taken Rio? The self-doubt crept in, but she shook it off.</p><p>A few seconds later, Agatha’s reply lit up the screen.</p><p>Agatha: Thai sounds perfect. I’ll leave the rest to you. I trust your judgment</p><p>Rio exhaled in relief. That was easy. Maybe too easy. She allowed herself a small smile, feeling a bit more at ease. This felt right, like she could do this, like they were on the same wavelength. The pressure wasn’t overwhelming; it was just two people taking things one step at a time.</p><p>Rio: Alright, it’s a date. I’ll text you the details soon. Can’t wait to see you again</p><p>Agatha: Same here ❤️</p><p>As Rio read Agatha’s reply, a warmth spread through her chest. Same here. Those words made everything feel like it was moving in the right direction. Rio replayed the conversation in her mind, her thoughts spinning with excitement. This wasn’t just another date. This was her date.</p><p>She was in control, taking the lead, and Agatha was letting her. It felt empowering. But the butterflies wouldn’t stop. She couldn’t help but wonder, What if I mess it up?</p><p>The next morning, Rio did some research on the restaurant, making sure it had the right atmosphere. She wanted somewhere intimate, where they could talk without feeling rushed or distracted by the noise of a crowded room. It needed to be perfect—a place where they could just relax and enjoy each other’s company. It wasn’t about impressing her; it was about making it feel natural.</p><p>Once everything was in place, she sent a chat to Agatha to confirm the time.</p><p>Rio: 7 PM good for you? I’ll pick you up. Can’t wait to see you</p><p>Agatha: Perfect. Send me your Reg and I’ll get you added to the gates. I’ll be ready. See you then, beautiful</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched as she read the message. Beautiful. The word hung in the air, sending a flush of warmth through her body. Beautiful. Agatha Harkness thought she was beautiful.</p><p>Her heart raced a little faster. Was it too soon to let herself be so affected by just a few words? The excitement bubbled up again, and she started overthinking everything, wondering if she was reading too much into it.</p><p>She spent the next few hours getting ready, trying to look as effortlessly beautiful as her date surely would. She slipped into a green dress—one that hugged her body just right—and spent extra time on her makeup, making sure it was subtle yet polished. Not too much. Not too little. Just enough. She wasn’t sure if she was trying to impress Agatha or herself, but either way, she wanted to feel confident when she saw her.</p><p>When she arrived at Agatha’s house, her nerves were on edge again. The door swung open, and there stood Agatha, looking effortlessly stunning in a sleek rust coloured dress with her hair pulled into a messy bun. Her eyes lit up as she smiled, the warmth of her gaze making Rio’s heart skip a beat.</p><p>“Wow, you look amazing,” Rio said, unable to keep the admiration from her voice. She could feel her cheeks flush as she took in the sight of Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into a playful grin. “You’re not so bad yourself.” She stepped forward, closing the distance between them, and before Rio could process it, Agatha kissed her lightly on the lips. The soft pressure sent a thrill through her, and she pulled away, breathless.</p><p>“Shall we go?” Agatha asked, her hand brushing against Rio’s.</p><p>Rio smiled, wide and genuine, as she opened the passenger door for Agatha. Her nerves were still there, swirling in her stomach, but they felt different now. They weren’t about fear; they were about excitement. The anticipation of what was to come. She ran around to the driver’s side, still trying to contain her excitement as they drove off, both of them carrying the unspoken promise of something special ahead.</p><p>The evening had been everything Rio had hoped for. The cozy, dimly lit Thai restaurant had been the perfect setting—soft, intimate, and filled with the rich scents of lemongrass and garlic. They shared plates of green curry and other dishes, their conversation flowing easily between laughter and thoughtful silences. Rio had never felt more at ease. Her heart had raced with excitement each time Agatha smiled at her, each time their fingers brushed, the connection between them undeniable.</p><p>At the end of the meal, they stepped outside, hands naturally intertwining, walking together under the soft glow of the streetlights. Rio’s heart was light, full of the quiet joy of being with someone who felt right in all the ways she hadn’t expected. Everything felt perfect. But as they approached the car, that perfect moment was shattered.</p><p>A burst of camera flashes, followed by the harsh clicking of lenses, stopped Rio in her tracks. She froze, her stomach dropping as she realized what was happening. Paparazzi. She hadn’t considered the fact that less upscale meant more accessible, more chance of them being spotted.</p><p>The air around them seemed to grow thick, as if the world had suddenly spun out of control. Rio’s face flushed a deep crimson as the camera flashes assaulted her from all directions. Her heart pounded in her chest, and she instinctively pulled away from Agatha, her mind scrambling, missing the slight hurt that passed over Agathas face.</p><p>What do I do?</p><p>The questions came too quickly, too loudly. “Who’s she?” “Is this a girlfriend?” “How serious is this?”</p><p>Her hands trembled as she tried to make sense of the chaos. The public eye. She hadn’t thought about it. She hadn’t prepared herself for this. Agatha was a star, but Rio was just a regular person, someone who had never been in the spotlight like this.  They’d avoided this on all of their previous dates.</p><p>The constant flashes, the way the questions felt invasive, it was overwhelming.</p><p>Agatha, however, appeared unfazed. She stood next to Rio, calm as ever, her posture relaxed despite the sudden storm of attention. She squeezed Rio’s hand gently, looking over at her with a soft, reassuring smile.</p><p>“Hey, don’t worry. Just keep waking,” Agatha said, her voice steady, like this was something she did every day. Her words, calm and patient, should have reassured Rio, but instead, they made her feel even more lost. She hadn’t thought of how accustomed Agatha was to this. To all of this.</p><p>Rio’s gaze flickered between Agatha and the paparazzi. She felt like she was suffocating, caught between the bright lights and the weight of expectation.</p><p>This isn’t what I signed up for, she thought, her chest tightening with panic. This is her world, not mine. Oh god why did I think this was a good idea?</p><p>The flashes continued, blinding, unrelenting. The constant barrage of questions felt like they were pushing her further away from Agatha, and the longer she stood there, the more disconnected she felt. She wanted to escape. She wanted to disappear. Her mind raced with worry.</p><p>How can we be normal if this is what happens every time we go out?*</p><p>Agatha turned slightly, addressing the photographers with a practiced, almost rehearsed smile, brushing off their questions like she was used to this kind of attention. Rio watched her, heart sinking as Agatha effortlessly handled the chaos, her calm demeanor only highlighting just how much Rio was struggling.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Agatha’s voice broke through Rio’s spiraling thoughts, gentle and concerned.</p><p>Rio blinked rapidly, trying to pull herself together, but the flood of emotions hit her all at once. She wanted to say she was fine, to tell Agatha that it didn’t bother her, that she could handle it. But the truth was, she didn’t know if she could. The intensity of it all was overwhelming, and she could feel the pressure building inside her.</p><p>“I… I don’t know,” Rio admitted, her voice small, shaky. “I didn’t think it would be like this. I didn’t know how much this... all this attention would affect me.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression softened, and for the first time, Rio noticed a crack in her calm exterior. Agatha shifted closer, squeezing her hand with a hint of nervousness. She’s worried, Rio realized, a pang of guilt twisting in her stomach. She hadn’t thought about how this might affect Agatha.</p><p>It wasn’t just Rio who was caught in the storm; Agatha had to deal with it every day.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, her gaze flicking back to the photographers for a moment before focusing back on Rio. “I get it. I’m sorry you didn’t know how bad it could get. I didn’t think it would be like this for you, but it’s… part of the job. It comes with being in the public eye. I’ve been doing this for so long, and I’ve never really thought about how it might affect someone else... someone I care about,” she admitted, her voice softer now. “But if you’re with me, you’ll have to deal with this. It’s always going to be a part of my life.”</p><p>Rio’s heart skipped at the quiet vulnerability in Agatha’s voice. She could see it now—the strain that Agatha was hiding behind that practiced smile, the way her hand tightened around Rio’s, holding onto her as though she was frightened it would be the last time, the way her eyes searched Rio’s face for any sign of hesitation.</p><p>She swallowed hard, trying to find the right words, but her mind was a jumble of conflicting emotions. I want to be with her. I’m down bad for her already. I like her so much. But this... this world is so overwhelming. I’m not sure I can handle it.</p><p>“I... I didn’t realize how hard it would be,” Rio said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. She felt so out of place in that moment, her uncertainty hanging heavy between them, her anxiety taking over. “I didn’t think it would feel so... suffocating. I don’t know if I can handle being in the spotlight like this. I don’t know if I can be a part of this.”</p><p>Agatha’s face tightened as she attempted to hide her hurt, the smile slipping from her lips as her eyes darkened slightly. Rio could see the worry creeping in, the fear that this was too much for Rio, that all of this attention would drive them apart. Agatha’s shoulders slumped just a little, as if the weight of Rio’s uncertainty had taken something from her.</p><p>“I never wanted to put this on you,” Agatha said quietly, her voice almost brittle. “I never wanted you to feel like you have to deal with this just because you’re with me. But if you’re going to be with me, this is part of it. As much as I wish it was different. And I understand if it’s too much. I won’t push you if you’re not ready for it.”</p><p>Rio’s heart tightened. The last thing she wanted was to hurt Agatha, to make her think she couldn’t handle it. I want to be with her, Rio thought. But can I really keep up with this? Can I handle this kind of pressure, the constant scrutiny?</p><p>She took a deep breath, trying to steady her nerves, her fingers still tangled with Agatha’s. “I don’t want to walk away, Agatha. I really don’t. I just need time to figure out how to... how to deal with this. I want to be with you, but I’m not sure I can be okay with the cameras, the flashing lights. I’m not sure I’m strong enough for this.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened, and she gave a tight, almost nervous smile. “You don’t have to be strong, Rio. You don’t have to be okay with it right away. I’m just asking if you’re willing to try, to stick it out with me even if it’s hard sometimes.”</p><p>Rio looked at her, searching her face. There was so much vulnerability in Agatha’s eyes—so much uncertainty, just like Rio’s. For the first time, Rio saw Agatha’s fear of losing her, and it made her heart ache. Agatha’s scared, because she cares, Rio realized. She’s worried that I won’t be able to handle her world.</p><p>Finally, after a long pause, Rio nodded. “I’m willing to try,” she said softly, her voice steady despite the swirling emotions. “I’ll try. But I need you to understand that this won’t be easy for me. It’s a lot.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled in relief, the tension leaving her shoulders as she smiled at Rio, a mix of hope and gratitude in her eyes. “I understand. We’ll take it slow. I promise, I will do everything I can to protect you from it all as much as I can.”</p><p>Rio smiled back, her mind worried but her heart full. As they drove away, she knew that no matter how difficult the road ahead might be, being with Agatha felt worth it.</p><p>“I’m up for it.” Rio said, her voice steady now, a small but confident smile spreading across her face. “Let’s see where this goes.”</p><p>Agatha reached over and took Rio’s hand once more, giving it a gentle squeeze. The car pulled away from the flashing lights, and for the first time that night, Rio felt a sense of calm settle in her chest. Whatever was to come, she was ready to face it—with Agatha by her side.</p><p>The car glided through the streets, the sound of the engine almost drowned out by the hum of Rio’s thoughts. She still couldn’t quite believe everything that had happened—how quickly things had escalated from shy glances to being with Agatha in the same car, holding hands, the paparazzi still flashing in the distance as they drove away. It was all so surreal, but the feelings she had for Agatha were anything but.</p><p>As the car slowed to a stop at a red light, Agatha turned to Rio, her eyes soft and intent. There was a pause, a moment of stillness where the world seemed to fall away, leaving just the two of them. Agatha's hand moved to Rio's cheek, her thumb brushing gently over her skin.</p><p>“I really like you, Rio,” Agatha whispered, her voice low and full of emotion. It wasn’t just a casual statement. It felt heavy, like she meant every word. There was an honesty in her gaze that Rio could feel down to her bones.</p><p>Before Rio could respond, Agatha leaned in, her lips capturing Rio’s in a kiss that was soft at first, tentative. But the moment their lips met, it deepened—gentle, yet undeniable. Rio’s heart skipped, her breath catching as the kiss grew more passionate, more urgent, the world outside fading away. The press of Agatha’s lips against hers sent a surge of warmth through her body, and she responded in kind, leaning closer, her hand finding its way to Agatha’s neck, fingers threading through her soft hair.</p><p>As they pulled apart, both of them breathing a little heavier, the flash of cameras lit up the car once more. The paparazzi had caught the kiss—a perfect shot of Agatha looking at Rio with the softest, most affectionate expression. It was as if the whole world could see the connection between them. A snapshot of love, or something close to it.</p><p>Agatha winced at the sound of the cameras clicking outside the window but didn’t let it faze her. She kept her gaze fixed on Rio, her expression both playful and sincere.</p><p>“Well, that will definitely make the press .” Agatha said with an apologetic grin, her hand still resting on Rio’s cheek. “You know, people will at least know we’re more than friends now.”</p><p>Rio’s heart fluttered at the mention of the word friends, she had no idea what they were yet, but she was ready to find out. But she also couldn’t shake the nervous excitement that crept up on her.</p><p>“I don’t mind if they think that,” Rio replied, her voice a little shaky from the kiss and the emotions swirling inside her.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened, and she took a deep breath. “Good, because I really don’t want us to be just friends or just dating, Rio.”</p><p>Rio blinked, unsure if she heard correctly. “Not friends or dating?” she repeated, her voice uncertain.</p><p>Agatha smiled, her thumb gently tracing the curve of Rio’s jaw. “Hmmmm. I want to be with you, Rio. I want you to come back to mine again with me tonight. And... I want to know if you’ll be my girlfriend.”</p><p>The words hung in the air, and Rio felt as if the ground had shifted beneath her feet. She had been so wrapped up in the whirlwind of their time together that she hadn’t even fully processed the idea that Agatha might feel this way about her. But hearing it out loud, seeing the sincerity in Agatha’s eyes, made it feel incredibly real.</p><p>Rio’s mind raced for a moment. Her heart was hammering in her chest as she looked at Agatha, taking in her soft smile and the vulnerability behind her words. There was no doubt that Agatha felt something real for her—something deeper than the rush of a few dates or a fleeting attraction. She could see it in her eyes, hear it in her voice.</p><p>“Agatha...” Rio whispered, her voice cracking slightly. “Yes. 100% yes. I want to be your girlfriend.”</p><p>The smile that spread across Agatha’s face was nothing short of joyous. It was a genuine smile, the kind that reached her eyes and made everything around them feel brighter. She leaned in again, kissing Rio more tenderly this time, her lips lingering as she whispered against them, “You just made me so happy.”</p><p>The car was filled with an intimacy that Rio had never experienced before—just the two of them, surrounded by the city lights, but in their own little world. Agatha pulled back, her eyes sparkling.</p><p>“I’m glad you said yes, Rio. Tonight’s just the beginning for us.” She rested her forehead against Rio’s for a moment, her hand still gently holding Rio’s, as if grounding them both in this moment of newfound connection.</p><p>The paparazzi had gotten their shot, but Agatha didn’t care. This wasn’t about them. This was about what they had, about the way Agatha’s words made Rio feel like she was exactly where she was supposed to be.</p><p>“So, you’re staying with me tonight, right” Agatha asked softly, her voice teasing but sincere.</p><p>Rio smiled, her heart full. “I’m staying.”</p><p>And with that, Rio drove them home, the night ahead filled with possibilities, new beginnings, new love, and the shared feeling that this was something they both wanted to explore, no matter what the paparazzi, or anyone else, might think.</p>

<p>The next morning, Rio woke up to the faint scent of coffee and the distant hum of a blender. Sunlight filtered through the luxurious curtains of Agatha’s bedroom, casting a warm glow over the plush bedding. For a moment, she just lay there, staring at the ceiling, processing everything.</p><p>She was in Agathas house. In her bed again. After officially becoming her girlfriend.</p><p>A sleepy, satisfied smile stretched across Rio’s lips as last night replayed in her head. Agatha had been so sweet, so affectionate, they had stayed up late talking, curled up together on the couch, sharing soft kisses and whispered confessions. Agatha had insisted on making them both tea, and they had ended up watching bad reality TV until they had celebrated their new relationship in bed together.</p><p>And now, she was here, waking up in Agatha’s bed, in her home, knowing that last night wasn’t just a dream.</p><p>The sound of a Snapchat notification pulled Rio from her thoughts. Groggy but curious, she reached for her phone on the bedside table and opened the app.</p><p>Bucky had posted to his story.</p><p>She tapped on it, and immediately, a video popped up.</p><p>Bucky was in Agatha’s kitchen, sitting on the counter, grinning like an absolute menace. Agatha stood behind him, her hair still messy from sleep, wearing Rio’s hoodie that she’d had in her night bag, which somehow looked ridiculously good on her.</p><p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” Bucky said dramatically, zooming in on Agatha, who was busy pouring coffee into a mug. “I have an important announcement. Our beloved, once emotionally unavailable ice queen—”</p><p>“Bucky.” Agatha’s voice came out warningly, but the smile on her face betrayed her amusement.</p><p>“—has finally been tamed,” Bucky continued, dodging a dish towel Agatha threw at him. “She is now a taken woman.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t deny it. Instead, she took a sip of her coffee and muttered, “I hate you.”</p><p>Bucky grinned at the camera. “Anyway, congrats to Rio for pulling this off. Never thought I’d see the day.”</p><p>Rio groaned, her cheeks heating up. Oh my god. He was here. Downstairs.</p><p>Before she could even process the secondhand embarrassment, another notification popped up, this time from Agatha’s private Snapchat story.</p><p>She hesitated for only a second before tapping on it.</p><p>The first snap was a picture of her coffee mug, sitting beside another one.</p><p>Caption: Morning coffee for two. ☕️💜</p><p>The second snap was a boomerang, Agatha sitting on the couch, Remi midway climbing onto her lap while the fluffy dog wiggled excitedly.</p><p>Caption: She loves me now but will ditch me the minute Rio wakes up</p><p>The next snap was a Video, Agatha, still in Rio’s hoodie, giving the camera a sleepy but genuine smile.</p><p>“Yeah, okay. Bucky’s an ass, but he’s not wrong. I really like her."</p><p>The snap ended, and Rio just stared at her phone, feeling her heart do a ridiculous little flip.</p><p>She really liked her.</p><p>Rio didn’t even hesitate—she took a quick selfie, still wrapped in Agatha’s blankets, her hair slightly messy from sleep.</p><p>Caption: I like you too. 💜</p><p>Then, without overthinking it, she sent it directly to Agatha.</p><p>A moment later, she heard soft footsteps approaching the bedroom, and when she looked up, Agatha was standing in the doorway, holding two mugs of coffee—one for each of them.</p><p>“Good morning, sweetheart,” Agatha murmured, her lips curving into a soft smile as she walked over and sat on the edge of the bed, handing Rio her mug.</p><p>Rio took it, feeling a warmth spread through her chest that had nothing to do with the coffee.</p><p>“Morning,” she replied, biting her lip to stop herself from smiling too hard. “Is Bucky still here?”</p><p>“No, I sent him home,” Agatha leaned in, pressing a slow, lingering kiss to Rio’s lips before whispering against them:</p><p>“Get used to waking up here because I’m not letting you go.”</p><p>And just like that, Rio knew she was in way too deep.</p><p>By the time Rio got home later that afternoon, she could tell something was off.</p><p>Her phone had been vibrating nonstop, Snapchat notifications, Instagram requests, texts from numbers she didn’t recognise.</p><p>She had brushed it off at first, assuming it was just a little extra attention because of the paparazzi photos from last night.</p><p>But then she opened Instagram.</p><p>Her follower count had tripled.</p><p>Her DMs were a mess—messages from old school friends, exes, distant relatives she hadn’t spoken to in years. The kind of people who had never really cared before but were suddenly very interested in her life now.</p><p>One particular message made her stomach drop.</p><p>Lisa (Ex-Girlfriend, 2019):<br/>Damn, Rio, you really went for someone famous, huh? Didn’t take you for a clout chaser lol. Hope you’re good though! It would be good to meet up soon!</p><p>Sophie (Ex-Girlfriend, 2021):<br/>Hey. Didn’t expect to see your face on a gossip site, lol. Crazy. We should catch up, I miss you</p><p>Megan (Old High School Friend):<br/>OMG RIOOO WTF. YOU’RE DATING AGATHA HARKNESS? TEXT ME BACK NOW. I NEED DETAILS</p><p>Rio groaned and locked her phone, tossing it onto her bed like it had personally offended her.</p><p>She had expected some attention—but this? This felt invasive.</p><p>She flopped onto her bed, rubbing her face. She didn’t ask for this. She just liked Agatha. She wasn’t trying to be some celebrity girlfriend or make headlines.</p><p>Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was a Snapchat from Agatha.</p><p>Agatha: I’m guessing by the radio silence that you’ve checked your phone. You okay?</p><p>Rio exhaled, sitting up and grabbing her phone again. She hesitated for a second before responding.</p><p>Rio: I’m fine. Just a little… overwhelmed</p><p>Agatha read it almost immediately.</p><p>Agatha: Yeah, I figured. It’s gonna be weird for a bit. But just so you know—you don’t owe anyone a response</p><p>Rio smiled a little. She knew that. But hearing it from Agatha made it easier to believe.</p><p>A second later, another message popped up.</p><p>Agatha: Come back to mine. I’ll cook for you.</p><p>Rio: That’s a dangerous offer. You did mention you set off your smoke alarm making toast once</p><p>Agatha: Okay, Bucky set off the smoke alarm, not me. And I actually CAN cook. You’ll see</p><p>Rio hesitated for only a moment before typing back:</p><p>Rio: I’m on my way</p><p>Whatever was waiting for her on social media could wait. Right now she just wanted to see Agatha.</p><p>Rio threw on a comfy sweater and jeans, grabbed her keys, and was out the door within minutes. The second she slid into her car, she felt relief, leaving behind the buzzing phone which was thrown in her bag, the flood of DMs, the overwhelming weight of sudden public attention.</p><p>The drive to Agatha’s was familiar after only driving back a few hours ago. She knew the turns, the landmarks, the moment when her GPS would tell her to take the private road leading into Agatha’s gated community. The security recognised her, waving her through without a second thought.</p><p>By the time she pulled into the driveway, some of the tension in her shoulders had eased.</p><p>She barely had time to ring the doorbell before the door swung open, revealing Agatha in sweatpants and a fitted long-sleeve top, barefoot, a lazy smile on her lips.</p><p>“You made it, sweetheart,” Agatha said, her voice warm and teasing as she pulled Rio inside. The moment the door shut behind them, Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s waist, holding her close.</p><p>Rio exhaled, melting into the hug.</p><p>“I needed to see you,” she admitted, voice muffled against Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>Agatha pressed a kiss to her temple, her hold tightening just a fraction. “Yeah, I figured.”</p><p>She pulled back, studying Rio’s face. “It’s a lot, huh?”</p><p>Rio let out a breathy laugh.“Understatement of the year.”</p><p>Agatha reached up, tucking a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. “You’re handling it better than I did my first time seeing my name in the tabloids.”</p><p>Rio lifted an eyebrow. “What did you do?”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Cried in my trailer for an hour, got drunk with Bucky, and threatened to delete all my socials.”</p><p>That pulled a genuine laugh from Rio, and Agatha’s eyes softened at the sound.</p><p>“Come on,” Agatha said, taking Rio’s hand and leading her toward the kitchen. “I promised you food, didn’t I?”</p><p>When Rio stepped into the kitchen, she immediately noticed three things:</p><p>1. There was flour on the counter<br/>2. A bottle of wine was already open<br/>3. The smoke alarm was… conspicuously missing from the ceiling</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes. “Agatha. Where’s your smoke detector?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even blink. “Temporarily removed for my own sanity.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because,” Agatha said, stepping around the counter and dramatically gesturing to a pan on the stove, “it was being a little bitch about me making homemade pasta.”</p><p>Rio stared at her. “The smoke detector objected to pasta?”</p><p>Agatha pointed accusingly at the stove. “Okay, it wasn’t just the pasta. There was also an incident with the garlic bread.”</p><p>Rio folded her arms. “What kind of incident?”</p><p>“…It may have been slightly on fire.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “You set bread on fire?”</p><p>“I fixed it!” Agatha insisted. “And we have a perfectly good pasta dish now. So I think I deserve some credit.”</p><p>Rio bit back a smile. “I’ll be the judge of that.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, reaching for the wine bottle and pouring them both a glass. “Fair enough. But if you hate it, you’re still stuck with me for the night, so you better pretend to love it.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m staying the night again?” Rio teased, taking her wine glass.</p><p>Agatha leaned in, her voice low and amused.</p><p>“Sweetheart, if you think I’m letting you go back home, stressed , after driving here and back once already, you’re out of your mind.”</p><p>Rio’s heart stuttered in her chest, but she just took a slow sip of her wine and smirked.</p><p>“Alright,” she said. “Let’s eat.”</p><p>Dinner was chaotic, mostly because Agatha kept making Rio laugh, spilling more about her past disastrous cooking attempts and how Bucky had once banned her from using the oven for a month.</p><p>The pasta? Surprisingly decent.</p><p>After dinner, they curled up on Agatha’s ridiculously comfy couch, Remi stretched out over both their laps, watching some old movie Agatha had put on for ‘aesthetic purposes’ but was clearly half-watching at best.</p><p>At some point, Rio’s phone buzzed again.</p><p>She glanced at it, saw more notifications from Instagram, Snapchat, and old contacts trying to reach out, and sighed.</p><p>Agatha, who had been playing with Rio’s fingers absentmindedly, noticed. “Want me to toss your phone in the pool?”</p><p>Rio laughed, but something about the offer was tempting.</p><p>Instead, she turned her phone off completely and placed it on the coffee table. “There. No more distractions.”</p><p>Agatha grinned, pulling Rio closer. “Good. Because I was about to demand your full attention.”</p><p>“Oh yeah?” Rio murmured, smirking as she turned to face her.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, her eyes dark and playful. “Mhm. I think my girlfriend deserves a proper distraction after the day she’s had.”</p><p>And then she leaned in, capturing Rio’s lips in a slow, deep kiss, wiping away every single thought except for this.</p>

<p>Rio had never been so aware of her phone before. It sat face-up on her kitchen counter, buzzing relentlessly like a bomb about to detonate. She hadn’t even looked at her notifications yet. She couldn’t.</p><p>Her stomach was in knots.</p><p>Instead, she paced the kitchen, clutching a mug of tea she had no intention of drinking, replaying the last few days over and over in her mind.</p><p>Her time at Agathas house, hiding from the world.</p><p>The paparazzi.</p><p>The pictures of them kissing in the car.</p><p>It was all out there now.</p><p>And judging by the sheer volume of her notifications, everyone had seen it.</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, forced herself to grab her phone, and opened Instagram first.</p><p>Her follower count had exploded, not just by a few hundred, but by thousands. How had they all even found her!</p><p>Then she checked her DMs.</p><p>It was worse than she’d imagined.</p><p>Her inbox was a war zone.</p><p>Some messages were sweet, fans of Agathas gushing over how cute she and Agatha looked together.</p><p>Some were jealous, mostly from people who had convinced themselves that they were supposed to be dating Agatha instead.</p><p>And then there were the worst ones. More  exes had reached out.</p><p>Serena (a one night mistake from four years ago): Wow. Didn’t expect to see you in the tabloids, lol. So… guess you’re too famous to catch up now?</p><p>Lena (a toxic disaster of a relationship): Oh, so you’re dating Agatha Harkness now? Wow, Rio. You always did like attention.</p><p>Elle (nice, but extremely clingy colleage fling): Hey! Crazy seeing you on my feed. I was actually thinking about you the other day… maybe we should talk?</p><p>Rio groaned, chucking her phone onto the couch like it had personally offended her.</p><p>This was a lot. She was just a florist.She wasn’t built for this. Before she could spiral any further, her phone buzzed again. This time, it was a Snapchat notification.</p><p>Not from the public chaos—this was from Agatha’s Snapchat.</p><p>She was met with a photo of Agatha, sprawled on her couch, wearing an oversized hoodie and eating cereal straight from the box. The caption?</p><p>Rio, are you alive? Did you die from notification overload? Blink twice if you need me to sue someone.</p><p>Rio snorted, some of the tension finally breaking.</p><p>Then another direct snap came through. A video this time.</p><p>Agatha, still in her hoodie, looking far too pleased with herself.</p><p>“Bucky and I are currently taking bets on how long it’ll take before you lose your mind and break your phone. I said by noon. Bucky said by now. If I win, he has to cook dinner for a week. If he wins, I have to let him DJ my next house party. Please, Rio. For the love of God, don’t make me suffer through his tragic taste in music.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, laughing despite herself. But before she could reply, another snap from Agatha came through.</p><p>This time, it was just a screenshot of her Instagram comments.</p><p>Specifically, the comment from another ex.</p><p>And then came Agatha’s next snap—a close-up of her unimpressed face, captioned:</p><p>Caption: EXCUSE ME???????</p><p>Rio choked on air.</p><p>Then the next one, Agatha, dramatically laying across her kitchen counter, looking like she was in emotional distress.</p><p>Caption: Your exes suddenly coming out of the woodwork like cockroaches. 🚨🚨🚨</p><p>Then, finally, one last snap.</p><p>A video of Bucky reading the comments out loud while Agatha looked fuming, absolutely howling with laughter.</p><p>“Ohhhh, this is RICH. ‘Didn’t expect to see you in the tabloids, we should catch up!”</p><p>Rio groaned, covering her face with her hands. Why was this her life now?</p><p>Finally, she grabbed her phone, typing out a quick response.</p><p>Rio: PLEASE stop reading my comments I’m already dying.</p><p>Agatha responded immediately with another snap, a picture of Remi sleeping on her lap.</p><p>Caption: Don’t worry, Rio. Your mine now, even if your exes are thirsting after you  ❤️</p><p>Rio froze. Her heart did a weird thing in her chest.</p><p>Then, before she could overthink it, she sent back a selfie, her face buried in a pillow, only her eyes peeking out.</p><p>Rio: How are you handling this so well?? I feel like I’m having an identity crisis.</p><p>It took Agatha a minute to respond, but when she did, it was another video.</p><p>She was sitting cross-legged on her couch, looking soft, relaxed, and… kind.</p><p>“I’ve been dealing with this for years, sweetheart. I promise, it gets easier.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip, staring at the screen. Then Agatha added, “But if it ever gets too much, you tell me, okay? You come first. Not the tabloids. Not the fans. Just you. I can have my manager put some blockers out”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, warmth blooming in her chest.</p><p>How was Agatha Harkness real and how did she get so lucky?</p><p>She hesitated, then typed:</p><p>Rio: What if I’m just being dramatic?</p><p>Agatha responded almost instantly.</p><p>Agatha: You’re not. This is a LOT. And I know you didn’t sign up for it. But I’m here. We’ll figure it out together, okay?</p><p>Rio exhaled, some of the panic finally easing.</p><p>Maybe… just maybe… she could handle this.</p><p>That evening, Rio was still reeling from all of the attention when her phone lit up.</p><p>Snapchat notification.</p><p>This time, it was a photo of Agatha’s feet up on her coffee table, a glass of wine in her hand, and Remi sprawled over her lap like a spoiled prince.</p><p>Caption: You should come over. Let’s hide from the world together.</p><p>Rio’s stomach flipped. Come over? To her house? Again?</p><p>She had only been home for two days and the idea of being around Agatha again, alone, in her gorgeous house, was both exciting and terrifying. Terrifying because she could easily get used to it.</p><p>And then another Snap arrived.</p><p>A video this time. Agatha, tilting the camera up from her wine glass, giving Rio a knowing smirk.</p><p>“Bucky’s here too. He says you’re not real until he sees you in person. So. You gonna prove your existence, sweetheart?”</p><p>Rio groaned, burying her face in her hands.</p><p>But then she peeked out, bit her lip, and responded with a Snap of her car keys in hand.</p><p>Caption: On my way. Tell Bucky to prepare himself</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, Rio was pulling up outside Agatha’s house.</p><p>She barely had time to take a deep breath before the front door swung open and Bucky Barnes himself was standing there, arms crossed, giving her a once-over.</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Uh. Hi?”</p><p>Bucky squinted. “You’re real.”</p><p>“…I am.”</p><p>Bucky turned his head, yelling back into the house. “SHE’S REAL, AGATHA. YOU’VE NOT BEEN CATFISHED BY AI AFTER ALL.”</p><p>Rio choked on air as Agatha’s laughter rang out from inside.</p><p>“Oh my God,” Rio muttered, covering her face. “I should have stayed home.”</p><p>“Nah, you’re already here,” Bucky said, grinning as he stepped aside. “C’mon, let’s see if you can survive us both in person.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure she would.</p><p>But she stepped inside anyway.</p><p>Agatha was curled up on the couch in sweatpants and a loose sweater, hair a little messy, makeup smudged just enough to make her look ridiculously good without trying and her glasses. She was wearing her glasses.</p><p>Rio swallowed hard.</p><p>“How’s my favorite florist?” Agatha asked, smirking.</p><p>Rio raised a brow. “I’m your only florist.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Agatha said, patting the spot beside her. “Now get over here before Bucky starts grilling you about your childhood trauma.”</p><p>Bucky winked from the kitchen. “Oh, don’t worry. I’ll get to that later.”</p><p>Rio laughed, shaking her head as she sat down beside Agatha who immediately kissed her in greeting. Remi immediately throwing her two front legs across her lap, curling up like she owned her.</p><p>Agatha watched with a small, amused smile. “Yeah. You’re officially part of the household now.”</p><p>Rio leaned into the couch, relaxing. Maybe this… wasn’t so scary after all.</p><p>Rio had barely sat down before a glass of wine was being placed in her hand.</p><p>Agatha smirked, curling up against the arm of the couch, her legs casually draped over Rio’s lap next to Remis like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Bucky, meanwhile, flopped onto the opposite end of the couch with a beer in hand and a dangerous glint in his eye.</p><p>“So,” he started, stretching his arm across the back of the couch and zeroing in on Rio like a shark sensing fresh blood. “I gotta say, you’re handling all this surprisingly well.”</p><p>Rio let out a breathless laugh, giving him a look. “Handling what?”</p><p>“You know,” Bucky gestured vaguely. “Dating a world-famous actress. Being thrown into the public eye overnight. Having deranged exes crawling out of the woodwork like a zombie movie.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, tossing a throw pillow at him. “Can you not?”</p><p>“What?” Bucky caught it effortlessly. “I’m just saying. Most people would be losing their minds right now.”</p><p>“Oh, don’t worry,” Rio said dryly, taking a very necessary sip of wine. “I had a full-blown panic attack this morning. It was great.”</p><p>Agatha nudged her knee gently. “I told you I’d handle it, sweetheart if needed.”</p><p>Bucky snorted. “And you did. By roasting her exes.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “Honestly? That helped.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “See? My methods are flawless.”</p><p>Bucky rolled his eyes. “Sure, sure. Anyway.” He leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. “I need to do a very important check before I can fully accept you into this little dysfunctional family.”</p><p>Rio raised a brow. “Oh?”</p><p>Agatha groaned, covering her face. “Don’t.”</p><p>Bucky ignored her. “Rio. Favorite horror movie. Go.”</p><p>Rio perked up instantly. “That’s easy. *The Thing 1982, obviously.”</p><p>Bucky lit up. “Solid choice. Good taste.”</p><p>“I know.” Rio smirked. “Your turn.”</p><p>“Alien.” Bucky took a sip of his beer. “Moss Weaver? A goddess.”</p><p>“Fair,” Rio admitted. Then, because she couldn’t resist, she turned to Agatha. “And yours?”</p><p>Agatha side-eyed both of them, clearly unamused. “Casper.”</p><p>Rio and Bucky both stared at her.</p><p>“…Casper?” Rio repeated.</p><p>Bucky was already cackling.</p><p>“Oh, shut up,” Agatha huffed, snatching Rio’s wine and taking a sip like she deserved it. “It’s a classic.”</p><p>Rio was grinning too hard. “Agatha. That is not a horror movie.”</p><p>“It has ghosts.”</p><p>“It’s a kids' movie,” Bucky laughed. “Were you traumatized by a cartoon, Aggie?”</p><p>“I was five!”</p><p>Rio leaned into Agatha’s side, mock-consoling her. “It’s okay. The ghosts can’t hurt you anymore.”</p><p>Bucky wiped a fake tear away. “Our big, bad, Hollywood icon… defeated by Casper.”</p><p>Agatha let out a dramatic sigh, shaking her head. “I hate both of you.”</p><p>Over the next hour, the three of them somehow ended up trading embarrassing stories, half-empty wine glasses and beer bottles scattered around the coffee table.</p><p>Bucky went first—recounting the time he accidentally slid into the DMs of his childhood crush, only to realize he had no idea who he was and thought he was a scam bot.</p><p>Rio nearly cried laughing.</p><p>Then Agatha, reluctantly, told the story of how she once tripped on her own gown at a red carpet event and dragged an entire set piece down with her.</p><p>Rio, who had actually seen the video of that moment resurface online a few months ago, was in tears.</p><p>Finally, they turned to Rio.</p><p>“Alright, florist girl,” Bucky grinned, stretching. “Your turn. What’s the most embarrassing thing you’ve ever done?”</p><p>Rio groaned, face heating up. “God, there’s too many.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Oh, come on. Spill.”</p><p>Rio buried her face in her hands. “Okay. Fine. One time, I, uh… accidentally texted my boss ‘I love you’ instead of ‘thank you’.”</p><p>“Nooo,” Agatha wheezed, clutching her stomach. “Oh my God, did they say anything?”</p><p>Rio groaned. “Immediately replied with ‘appreciate it, but I’m married.’”</p><p>Bucky nearly fell off the couch.</p><p>Agatha, tears in her eyes, clutched Rio’s arm. “You—are my favorite person. Seriously.”</p><p>Rio grinned, warmth blooming in her chest. She had been so nervous about this. About meeting Bucky. About stepping even further into Agatha’s world.</p><p>But now?</p><p>Sitting here, laughing until her sides ached, Agatha’s hand resting casually on her thigh, Bucky cracking jokes at their expense—</p><p>It felt natural.</p><p>Like she was meant to be here.</p><p>As the night wound down, Agatha stretched dramatically, then pulled out her phone.</p><p>“I should warn you,” she mused, “Bucky documents everything*”</p><p>“You’re one to talk,” Bucky shot back, already typing.</p><p>Snapchat notification. BuckyBarnes added to his story.</p><p>Rio opened it instantly.</p><p>The first post? A selfie of him looking exhausted, with Rio and Agatha laughing in the background.</p><p>Caption: Trapped in third wheel hell. Pray for me.</p><p>The second? A blurry photo of Agatha, mid-sentence, gesturing wildly.</p><p>Caption: She’s talking about Shakespeare, I am perishing.</p><p>The third? A video of Remi now curled up between Rio and Agatha.</p><p>Caption: The dog has chosen its new mom It’s over for all of you</p><p>Rio snorted, nudging Agatha. “You let him do this?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “He’s annoying, but he’s my annoying.”</p><p>Bucky grinned. “And now, by extension, your problem too.”</p><p>Rio sighed, but there was no real complaint behind it.</p><p>Honestly? She didn’t mind. At all.</p>

<p>It had been a relatively peaceful few weeks since Rio’s name first hit the tabloids.</p><p>Thanks to Agatha’s legal team of doom, the reporters and paparazzi who had been swarming her little flower shop in the beginning had been swiftly dealt with. No more camera flashes through the window, no more invasive questions when she tried to make deliveries, no more strangers lurking outside like they were waiting for her to slip up and say something scandalous.</p><p>Now, the only thing she had to worry about was not accidentally cutting herself while trimming rose stems.</p><p>Which was good, because lately, her mind was occupied with only one thing—Agatha.</p><p>She caught herself smiling at nothing at least five times a day. Sometimes more. It was ridiculous, really.</p><p>It wasn’t just the fact that she was dating the Agatha Harkness —a world-famous actress, Hollywood’s golden girl, a literal dream to millions. Yeah, that part was surreal. And, okay, maybe a little bit of an ego boost.</p><p>But more than that, it was her.</p><p>It was the way Agatha still sent her snaps of Remi, her spoiled greyhound, dramatically demanding treats. The way she’d send texts like, ‘Saw this flower today, thought of you’, followed by some blurry photo of a random bloom she’d spotted on set.</p><p>It was the way Agatha made Rio feel seen.</p><p>Wanted. Cherished.</p><p>She was falling. No—she had already fallen. And that was terrifying. Sure she had loved Agatha as an idea, as a fantasy, but now she LOVED her.</p><p>Before she could spiral too hard about it, the front bell chimed, signaling a customer.</p><p>She turned, a polite smile already forming—only to freeze when she saw who was standing in the doorway.</p><p>Her stomach dropped.</p><p>“Oh, hell no.”</p><p>Natasha.</p><p>Her ex.</p><p>Natasha had always been the worst kind of ex—the kind who still acted like she had a claim on Rio, despite being the one who had cheated on her.</p><p>And now, after years of radio silence, she had the audacity to just show up?</p><p>Now?</p><p>When Rio’s name had just hit the press and Natasha was a wannabe instafluer?</p><p>Yeah. Not subtle.</p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, crossing her arms. “What are you doing here, Natasha?”</p><p>Natasha grinned, all fake charm and calculated ease, like she was already enjoying whatever twisted game she was playing. “What? Can’t a girl visit an old friend?”</p><p>Rio didn’t blink. “We’re not friends.”</p><p>Nat clicked her tongue, stepping further inside. “Damn. Fame’s changed you already, huh?”</p><p>Oh, she wanted to deck her.</p><p>Instead, she took a deep breath and glared. “I don’t have time for this.”</p><p>Nat, unfazed, shrugged dramatically. “Look, I just wanted to talk. Maybe grab coffee, catch up—”</p><p>And then, before Rio could react, she leaned in like she was about to kiss her.</p><p>Like she thought she could just waltz back in, pull some dramatic stunt, and get her face in the tabloids.</p><p>Rio’s entire body reacted on instinct.</p><p>She stepped back fast, grabbing the nearest thing within reach—a spray bottle she used to mist delicate flowers—</p><p>And sprayed her right in the face.</p><p>“WHAT THE—” Nat stumbled back, spluttering.</p><p>Rio didn’t lower the bottle. “Are you kidding me?” she snapped. “You thought you could just show up here and kiss me?”</p><p>Nat wiped her face, looking absolutely offended. “Jesus, Rio, you used to enjoy it.”</p><p>“Oh, screw you.”</p><p>Nat held up her hands. “Alright, alright, no need to—”</p><p>“Get. Out.”</p><p>There must have been something in her voice, something cold, something final, because Nat’s smirk dropped.</p><p>Rio had always been the nice one. Always let things slide. Always gave people too much leeway.</p><p>Not today.</p><p>Not when she had something worth protecting.</p><p>Natasha exhaled sharply, shaking her head. “Fine. Whatever. I’ll see you around, superstar.”</p><p>And with that, she turned on her heel and walked out, probably off to brag about this little interaction to her followers.</p><p>Rio exhaled, her grip loosening on the spray bottle. Her hands were still shaking, not from fear, just pure, pissed-off adrenaline.</p><p>And then, her phone buzzed.</p><p>A Snapchat notification.</p><p>Rio’s frustration ebbed as she pulled it out of her pocket, already smiling when she saw the name on the screen.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>It was a photo. Agatha was sitting in a makeup chair, her hair halfway done, holding up her script with a dramatic, suffering expression while a stylist worked around her.</p><p>Caption: Another 14-hour day, send help (or snacks or your body)</p><p>Rio huffed out a laugh, shaking her head.</p><p>Without thinking, she snapped a photo of her own face, rolling her eyes dramatically.</p><p>Caption: Imagine being this dramatic about your literal dream job.</p><p>Agatha’s reply was instant.</p><p>Agatha: Imagine having zero sympathy for your incredibly sexy girlfriend.</p><p>Rio bit her lip, warmth pooling in her chest.</p><p>She tapped out a quick response.</p><p>Rio: Imagine knowing you’re sexy and using it against me.</p><p>Agatha: Sweetheart, I don’t have to use anything against you. You’re already weak for me.</p><p>Rio groaned, pressing a hand to her face.<br/>
Rio: Shut up.</p><p>Agatha: Make me.</p><p>God, she was insufferable. And sexy. And turning Rio on with just her teasing.</p><p>Rio: Okay. I’m never kissing you again. There. You’re made</p><p>Agatha: Oh no. How will I survive. I am so devastated. So very heartbroken</p><p>Rio snorted. You’re the worst.</p><p>Agatha: *And yet, you love it</p><p>Her heart stopped. She stared at the words, pulse hammering in her throat. She did love it. She loved her.</p><p>Agatha sent another message before she could panic.</p><p>Agatha: Just saying. You’re kinda obvious</p><p>Rio exhaled, staring at the screen.</p><p>And then, before she could second-guess herself, she typed back.</p><p>Rio: Yeah. I do love it</p><p>Agatha’s response came almost immediately.</p><p>Agatha: Good. Because I love it too</p><p>Rio’s chest ached. In the best possible way.<br/>
She bit her lip, smiling down at her phone.</p><p>Yeah. Natasha was a distant memory.</p><p>Rio stared at her phone, Agatha’s words glowing on the screen like a tiny sun.</p><p>Good. Because I love it too.</p><p>Her breath caught in her throat. That was so close to the words she actually wanted to say and hear.</p><p>She knew Agatha was playful, always toeing the line between teasing and serious, but this—this didn’t feel like a joke.</p><p>She reread the message about five times, heart hammering against her ribs like it wanted out.</p><p>Agatha loved it too. Loved her maybe?</p><p>She was in love with Agatha. She’d known it for a while now, had felt it in the way her chest ached when they were apart, in the way she craved the sound of her voice, the warmth of her laugh.</p><p>In the way she needed Agatha, not in a desperate, unhealthy obsessive way, but in a way that felt like natural. Like something essential.</p><p>But she hadn’t said it yet. Hadn’t let the words slip free. Not out of fear that it wasn’t true—God, she knew it was true. No, it was something else, something harder to explain.</p><p>She’d never been anyone’s first choice before. Never been loved in the way Agatha made her feel loved.</p><p>Natasha had never looked at her like she was it. Had never made her feel safe enough to say those words without worrying they’d be thrown back in her face later, twisted into something ugly.</p><p>But Agatha— Agatha was different.</p><p>She told Rio she was beautiful when she was covered in dirt from working in her shop all day, sent her sleepy voice notes when she was sleeping at her own home as soon as she woke up just to say good morning. She made Rio feel like she was the most important person in her orbit, like she wasn’t just another passing thing, but something she wanted to hold onto.</p><p>And God, Rio wanted to say it.</p><p>Wanted to tell her yes, I’m in love with you, wanted to hear Agatha say it to her, just to be sure she hadn’t imagined the connection they had.</p><p>But now, sitting in the quiet of her flower shop, hands still unsteady from the confrontation with Nat, she hesitated.</p><p>Because if she said it, it was real.</p><p>And real things could break.</p><p>Her phone buzzed again.</p><p>Agatha: Rio? Did I just freak you out? You can pretend I didn’t say that if you want</p><p>Rio’s heart squeezed.</p><p>She could picture Agatha now—biting her lip, second-guessing herself, probably wondering if she’d triggered Rios ability to spiral.</p><p>She hated that she’d made her wait even this long. So before she could talk herself out of it, she started typing.</p><p>Rio: You didn’t freak me out</p><p>Agatha’s reply was immediate.</p><p>Agatha: Good, I mean it you know</p><p>A pause.</p><p>Rio: Prove it to me - your place tonight?</p><p>Agatha: Your cooking then 😘</p><p>Rio exhaled, a smile tugging at her lips. Yeah. That wasn’t too heavy, but soon, soon she would tell her.</p>

<p>Rio sent a snapchat of her face, pouting and eyes fluttering.</p><p>Caption: Pretty please can you meet Agatha?</p><p>Rio fidgeted with her phone, watching the little typing bubble appear and disappear as Alice debated her answer.</p><p>Finally, a message popped up.</p><p>Alice: Okay. But if she’s weird or scary in real life, I’m running.</p><p>Rio: You’re weird and scary in real life.</p><p>Alice: Yeah, but I’m FUN weird and scary.</p><p>Rio: Fair point</p><p>Alice was trying to sound casual, but Rio knew her best friend. She was freaking out.</p><p>Which was hilarious because Alice had never been intimidated by anyone in her entire life.</p><p>She’d once flipped off a fellow police officer who cut her in line for coffee. She had personally told off multiple people for being rude to a baristas. She was fearless.</p><p>But now?</p><p>She was nervous about meeting Agatha.</p><p>Which was even funnier because, unbeknownst to Alice, Agatha was nervous too.</p><p>Agatha: Are you sure she wont hate me?</p><p>Rio snorted, texting back.</p><p>Rio: Why would she hate you?</p><p>Agatha: Because I’m famous and dating you, and she’s your ride-or-die best friend. Best friends always hate the new person at first.</p><p>Rio: Bucky doesn’t hate me. She doesn’t hate you.</p><p>Agatha: Yes but he’s wired wrong. Yet - she doesnt hate me yet</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes.</p><p>Rio: I’m more worried about YOU hating HER, honestly. She has no filter</p><p>Agatha’s response was instant</p><p>Agatha: Oh, I know. I’m going through her Twitter right now</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>Rio: YOUR WHAT?</p><p>Agatha: I have to make sure I’m not walking into a trap. Your best friend is feral.</p><p>Rio: YOUR SCROLLING ALICE’S TWITTER??</p><p>Agatha: It’s an experience.</p><p>Rio died inside. Alice’s Twitter was an unhinged wasteland.</p><p>No filter. No shame. Just pure chaos.</p><p>Rio: I’m afraid to ask what you’ve seen.</p><p>Agatha: She threatened to fight God over a canceled TV show.</p><p>Rio: That’s pretty normal</p><p>Agatha: She also said last year, and I quote, “If I ever meet Agatha Harkness in person, I’m either punching her in the face, making out with her or asking her for money.”</p><p>Rio choked on air.</p><p>Rio: OH MY GOD.</p><p>Agatha: So yeah, I think I have even more of a right to be nervous.</p><p>Rio facepalmed. This was going to be a disaster.</p><p>They picked a neutral location, a cozy little brunch spot where neither of them could cause too much damage.</p><p>Alice and Rio arrived first.</p><p>Agatha arrived a few minutes later, wearing sunglasses indoors like a criminal trying to avoid detection. Or a megastar not wanting to draw attention to herself.</p><p>Rio sighed when Agatha sat down in the booth they’d chosen. “You’re not in the mafia. Take those off.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated before dramatically removing them.</p><p>Alice, meanwhile, was just staring at her. Like she was studying an exotic animal in the wild.</p><p>“…You’re real,” Alice finally said.</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Last time I checked.”</p><p>Alice narrowed her eyes. “You’re shorter than I thought you’d be.”</p><p>Agatha looked genuinely offended. “I’m five-five.”</p><p>“You give taller energy,” Alice shrugged. “It’s the personality.”</p><p>Agatha turned to Rio. “Is this her version of a compliment?”</p><p>Rio sipped her coffee. “Honestly? Yeah.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Great.”</p><p>Alice leaned in, squinting at Agatha like she was searching for a sign of weaknesses.</p><p>“So, tell me,” she said, steepling her fingers, “what are your intentions with my best friend?”</p><p>Rio groaned. “Alice, oh my god.”</p><p>But Agatha? Agatha just grinned.</p><p>“My intentions?” she repeated, tilting her head. “Long walks on the beach. Late-night conversations. Stealing her hoodies. Maybe someday we’ll get another dog.”</p><p>Alice’s eyes narrowed further. “Uh-huh.”</p><p>Agatha leaned forward, a spark of mischief in her eye. “Your turn. What are YOUR intentions with my girlfriend?”</p><p>Alice blinked, stunned at her cool facade being so easily disarmed. “What?”</p><p>“You’re very intense,” Agatha said seriously. “Should I be worried you’re planning a hostile takeover? Trying to win her for yourself?”</p><p>Alice snorted. “Ew, no. She steals the blankets.”</p><p>Agatha gasped. “She does! I tell her that all the time!”</p><p>Rio, who had been minding her business. suddenly found herself under attack.</p><p>“Okay, hold on—”</p><p>“Yeah” Alice confirmed, grinning. “Total menace. A sleep fiend.”</p><p>Agatha turned to Rio, betrayed. “I told you. You let me freeze in my own bed.”</p><p>“Oh my god, I—”</p><p>“She also talks in her sleep doesn’t she,” Alice added gleefully. “Once I heard her arguing with someone about sandwiches at three a.m.”</p><p>Agatha lit up. “What was her argument?”</p><p>Alice sipped her coffee. “She was pro-mayo.”</p><p>Agatha clutched her chest. “I knew I picked the right girl.”</p><p>Rio buried her face in her hands. “You two are the worst.”</p><p>By the time brunch ended, Agatha and Alice were practically best friends. Which, for Rio, was equal parts heartwarming and terrifying.</p><p>Alice made a dramatic show of pulling Rio aside before they left.</p><p>“I approve,” she declared. “But if she breaks your heart, I’m legally required to throw hands.”</p><p>Rio sighed. “I wouldn’t expect anything less.”</p><p>“And also,” Alice added, grinning wickedly, “she just told me how you call her ‘baby’ when your tired.”</p><p>Rio blanched. Agatha, from across the room, just winked.</p><p>They spent the rest of the evening curled up in bed, Rio half in Agatha’s lap, content with how the meeting between her best friend and who she was slowly beginning to think was the love of her life, went so well. She was mesmerised watching Agatha read her scripts with her glasses perched on the edge of her nose.</p><p>At some point, Agatha dozed off, her head resting against Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>It was peaceful. Perfect.  Both tangled together sound asleep.</p><p>Until midnight hit.</p><p>And suddenly— BLARING MUSIC</p><p>Stevie Nicks, specifically.</p><p>The opening notes of Edge of Seventeen shattered the silence like a bomb going off.</p><p>Agatha, who had been fast asleep mere seconds ago, groaned loudly, dragging a pillow over her face.</p><p>“Oh no,” she mumbled into it.</p><p>Rio jolted up, alarmed. “What the hell?”</p><p>There was movement downstairs. A clatter. A shake of a cocktail shaker.</p><p>The unmistakable sound of a blender.</p><p>And Agatha, with the deep, tired sigh of someone who had seen this exact scenario too many times before, just muttered—“Mother.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “What?”</p><p>But before Agatha could answer, a woman’s voice rang out from downstairs—loud, delighted, and just a little bit tipsy.</p><p>“MIDNIGHT MARGARITAS, BABY!”</p><p>Agatha groaned. “I hate my life.”</p><p>Rio stared at her. “You’re telling me that at midnight, on a random weekday, your mother just... shows up and starts making margaritas like she’s in Practical Magic?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even bother lifting her head. “Yes.”</p><p>“And you just... let it happen?”</p><p>Agatha sighed dramatically, finally peeling herself up from the bed.</p><p>“There’s no stopping Lilia,” she said grimly. “You can only hope to contain her.”</p><p>Rio, who had never met Agatha’s mother before, had only seen the snapchats on mothers day, was now deeply intrigued.</p><p>And slightly terrified.</p><p>They made their way downstairs, the sound of Stevie Nicks still shaking the walls.</p><p>And there, standing in the kitchen like some kind of tequila-wielding sorceress, was Lilia Calderou.</p><p>Agatha’s mother.</p><p>Wearing an expensive silk kimono, perfectly winged eyeliner despite the hour, and mixing margaritas like it was her full-time job.</p><p>She spotted them and grinned.</p><p>“Ah! The lovebirds have arrived!”</p><p>Agatha dragged a hand down her face.“Mother. It’s the middle of the night.”</p><p>“And?” Lilia said, completely unbothered, pouring margaritas into salt-rimmed glasses. “You think Stevie Nicks only works in daylight? Midnight margaritas, darling—it’s tradition.”</p><p>Rio - who had no idea what was happening but was loving every second of it - finally spoke up.</p><p>“You’re actually just like the movie.”</p><p>Lilia beamed. “Oh, sweetheart, I am the movie.”</p><p>Agatha, exhausted beyond belief, just grabbed a margarita and downed half of it in one go.</p><p>Lilia gasped. “Where are your manners?! Introduce me to the poor girl you’ve been hoarding away these past few months!”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Mother, this is Rio. Rio, my mother—Lilia, agent of chaos and destroyer of peace.”</p><p>Lilia laughed delightedly, stepping forward and grasping Rio’s hands.</p><p>“Oh, honey, you’re even prettier in person,” she said, squeezing her hands warmly. “I was worried my daughter was going to end up a spinster, but you’re absolutely stunning.”</p><p>Rio, who had never been called stunning by an older, elegant,  tequila-wielding woman before, just... blushed.</p><p>Agatha groaned. “Mother, please.”</p><p>“What? I’m just saying, if I were twenty years younger, I’d be very jealous.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head back, exasperated. Pulling out her phone and capturing a video of the blender and line of drinks.</p><p>Caption: When your mom literally thinks your life is a movie</p><p>Rio, flustered but amused, just laughed. “It’s nice to meet you.”</p><p>“Oh, sweetheart, the pleasure is mine,” Lilia said dramatically, handing Rio a margarita. “Tell me, has my daughter been treating you right? Because I’ll have you know, she’s never been this in l…”</p><p>“MOTHER,” Agatha interrupted, grabbing Rio’s hand and pulling her toward the living room. “We’re going back to bed, you can sleep in the guest room.”</p><p>Lilia just cackled, sipping her margarita.</p><p>“Love you too, baby!” she called after them.</p><p>Agatha collapsed onto the bed face-first.</p><p>Rio sat on the edge, still processing.</p><p>“…So that’s your mom.”</p><p>Agatha’s muffled voice came from the pillow. “The woman, the myth and the legend”</p><p>Rio bit back a grin. “I think I love her.”</p><p>Agatha lifted her head just enough to glare.</p><p>“Don’t encourage her.”</p><p>Rio just laughed, flopping down next to her.</p><p>Midnight margaritas, huh?</p><p>Dating Agatha Harkness was never going to be boring.</p>

<p>Rio still wasn’t over the whole midnight margarita ambush.</p><p>Agatha’s mother was a lot. In the best, most ridiculous way possible. She had sent Rio a Snapchat request the next morning, which Rio had tentatively accepted, only to immediately receive a picture of a perfectly made mimosa.</p><p>Caption: Breakfast is waiting. I see why my daughter likes you</p><p>Rio had screeched when she opened it, while Agatha, still half-asleep, had just groaned and buried her face in a pillow.</p><p>“She’s testing you.”</p><p>“Testing me for what?”</p><p>“To see if you can survive her.”</p><p>Honestly, Rio wasn’t sure she could.</p><p>Agatha had been ridiculously busy the next few days, which meant Rio only got to experience her life through Snapchat stories and chaotic texts.</p><p>There were pictures of script pages, half-covered in her scrawled notes, captioned: If I have to cry in ONE more scene, I’m billing my therapist.</p><p>One of Bucky filming her from a horrific angle as she sat slumped in a makeup chair, looking utterly exhausted, captioned: Glamorous life of a movie star.</p><p>A video where she whisper-screamed at a malfunctioning coffee machine on set: “If you don’t work, I don’t work.”</p><p>And, of course, the occasional cute one, Agatha and Remi on a walk, the dog’s ears flopping in the wind, captioned: My child, my everything</p><p>Rio obsessively watched them all, feeling a little ridiculous for missing Agatha so much when she’d just seen her.</p><p>She was getting so soft.</p><p>Then, one night, Rio was flipping through Agatha’s latest Snap stories when she got a message.</p><p>Agatha: Hey, sweetheart, can I call?</p><p>Rio, already grinning like an idiot, sent back a selfie from bed with an exaggerated thumbs-up.</p><p>A second later, her phone rang.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, voice already warm just from hearing Agatha’s voice.</p><p>“Hey yourself,” Agatha purred. “So, listen—I have a movie premiere coming up. For that thing I shot last year. And I was wondering…”</p><p>“…Yeah?”</p><p>“…If you’d come with me.”</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>“Like… as in… a red carpet?”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Yes, Rio, as in a red carpet.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, mind blanking entirely. “Oh. Oh no.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “What do you mean, oh no?”</p><p>“I mean, oh no, I’ll be looked at.”</p><p>Agatha laughed again, but softer this time. “Sweetheart, people already know we’re together. This is just… making it more official. I want you there.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip. “But I—I don’t know how to do any of that. What if I trip? What if I get blinded by the camera flashes and accidentally walk into traffic?”</p><p>Agatha sighed dramatically. “Then I’ll personally pull you back to safety, like the heroic girlfriend I am.”</p><p>Rio groaned, burying her face in her pillow.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha said, softer now. “I promise I won’t let anything bad happen to you. If it gets too much, we leave. No pressure, okay?”</p><p>Rio sighed. “Okay. But if I say something weird in an interview, you have to pretend I’m a very sophisticated European model who doesn’t speak English.”</p><p>Agatha cackled. “Deal.”</p><p>The night before the premier, Agatha posted a short video to her private Snap:</p><p>A gorgeous dress laid out on her bed, all deep purple silk and elegance.</p><p>Caption: Big night tomorrow. Got the prettiest date, too. Nervous? Me? Never</p><p>Rio, watching this from her couch, felt her stomach flip.</p><p>Because holy shit. This was happening.</p><p>And it was happening tomorrow.</p><p>The morning of the premiere, Rio woke up in a state of sheer panic.</p><p>Because what the hell was she doing? She was a florist. She arranged pretty little bouquets for a living. Meanwhile, Agatha Harkness was an internationally famous actress.</p><p>And somehow, against all logic, Rio was about to walk a red carpet with her.</p><p>She arrived at Agatha’s house early in the afternoon, heart pounding.</p><p>Agatha, still in silk pajama pants and a half-unbuttoned dress shirt, greeted her at the door with a coffee in hand.</p><p>“Hello.” Agatha smirked, leaning in to kiss her.</p><p>“Hello, sweetheart.” Rio groaned as she stepped inside. “I think I’m having a heart attack.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, tugging her inside. “You’re being dramatic.”</p><p>“No, I mean it. My palms are sweating. What if I trip?”</p><p>“Then I’ll catch you.”</p><p>“What if I say something weird?”</p><p>Agatha sipped her coffee. “That’s inevitable.”</p><p>Rio gasped. “Rude.”</p><p>Agatha just grinned and led her upstairs, where a team of stylists was already setting up in front of a vanity mirror.</p><p>“Oh, no,” Rio said. “Oh no, I’m not famous enough for this.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You’re famous adjacent, by association. Sit.”</p><p>Rio, weak to Agatha in bossy mode, obeyed.</p><p>She watched Agatha disappear into another room to get changed while a stylist took over her face.</p><p>“You’re gonna be fine,” the stylist assured her.</p><p>“I think I might pass away,” Rio muttered.</p><p>The stylist laughed.</p><p>When they finally arrived at the event, Rio’s stomach was in knots.</p><p>The flashing lights, the screaming fans—it was so much worse than she imagined.</p><p>Agatha, looking impossibly gorgeous in her deep purple silk dress, just squeezed her hand. “Stay with me, sweetheart. I got you.”</p><p>Which was sweet. But also, Agatha was famous, so all eyes were on her.</p><p>It was fine at first. They posed for some pictures, Agatha’s arm wrapped securely around her waist.</p><p>Then, interviews started happening.</p><p>And that was when Rio completely lost her ability to function as a human.</p><p>A reporter turned to her. “So, Rio, how are you handling your first big event?”</p><p>Rio blinked. Brain empty. Zero thoughts. She opened her mouth. “Uh. Sweating.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, trying to cover her laugh.</p><p>The reporter smiled. “Sweating?”</p><p>“Yeah, um.” Rio gestured vaguely. “It’s hot out here.”</p><p>It was not hot out here. It was a pleasant 68 degrees.</p><p>The reporter, bless them, rolled with it. “And what’s it like dating Agatha?”</p><p>Rio, still panicking: “Well. She’s very…um… she’s okay.”</p><p>Agatha lost it.</p><p>Cameras flashed. Reporters laughed.</p><p>Rio immediately wanted to dig a hole and live in it.</p>

<p>From the moment Rio stepped onto the red carpet, she knew she had made a terrible, terrible mistake.</p><p>The cameras were blinding. The screams from fans were deafening. The sheer pressure of standing next to Agatha freaking Harkness at a major Hollywood event was enough to make her feel like she was going to melt into a puddle of awkwardness right then and there.</p><p>Agatha, of course, looked like she was born for this. Meanwhile, Rio was simply trying not to throw up on her shoes.</p><p>"Just breathe, sweetheart," Agatha murmured, her hand resting lightly on Rio's lower back.</p><p>"Breathing is hard," Rio whispered back through gritted teeth.</p><p>Agatha just chuckled and squeezed her waist. "You're adorable when you panic."</p><p>Rio shot her a betrayed look. This was not a time to be adorable. This was a time to focus on not publicly humiliating herself.</p><p>Unfortunately, that goal would not be met.</p><p>After already telling one reported Agatha was ‘okay’, they moved further down the carpet, a reporter from ET Tonight stopped them with a bright, beaming smile.</p><p>"Agatha! Looking absolutely stunning as always. And this must be Rio, the woman who's stolen your heart!"</p><p>Rio, very much not prepared to be acknowledged in such a way, blinked like a deer caught in headlights.</p><p>"Yep, this is my girlfriend," Agatha said smoothly, sliding an arm around Rio’s waist. She was so at ease, so effortlessly charming that Rio wanted to cry from how unfair it was.</p><p>The reporter turned to Rio, microphone out. "How does it feel to be here tonight, walking the red carpet with one of Hollywood’s biggest stars?"</p><p>Rio's brain short-circuited.</p><p>The correct response would have been something like ‘It's an honor,’ or ‘I'm so excited to be here.’</p><p>Instead, her mouth betrayed her. Again, with the same line.</p><p>"I'm sweating a lot."</p><p>Agatha immediately burst into laughter.</p><p>The reporter, to their credit, took it in stride. "Understandable! Big night, lots of cameras."</p><p>Rio, still spiralling, “Yeah. And also, it's…um…I already said this over there, its hot?"</p><p>Agatha, grinning ear to ear, leaned into the mic and deadpanned, " She’s nervous."</p><p>The reporter laughed. “Well, its a big night, nerves will do that to you!"</p><p>Rio, now desperate to recover, blurted out, "She’s just very… tall tonight"</p><p>A beat of silence.</p><p>Then Agatha completely lost it. She threw her head back, laughing so hard that she had to briefly let go of Rio to clutch her stomach.</p><p>The reporter was now laughing too. "Tall?"</p><p>Rio, already accepting death, nodded solemnly. "Very tall. Heels."</p><p>By the time they reached the main event inside the theater, Rio’s disastrous interview was already trending on social media.</p><p>#Tallgate was officially a thing.</p><p>Twitter was having a field day.</p><p>AgathaHarknessStan: Rio calling Agatha tall as if we didn’t already see the pics of her being taller than Agatha normally???? Girl you could’ve said ANYTHING.</p><p>@LesbianDisaster69: Protect Rio at all costs. She’s one of us.</p><p>@MovieNerd101: Rio: “She’s okay and tall." Agatha: immediately falls more in love with her</p><p>@GayForHarkness: Agathas real laugh at her girlfriend’s awkwardness???? SHE IS SO GONE FOR HER.</p><p>@RedCarpetFails: SWEATING. This is the most relatable red carpet moment in HISTORY.</p><p>Even Agathas celebrity friends were joining in.</p><p>@BuckyBarnes (yes, Agatha's best friend Bucky): Welcome to the elite club of people who publicly embarrass themselves for fun.</p><p>@THEGREENWITCH: I just spit out my drink watching Rio’s interview. Protect her. She’s precious.</p><p>Meanwhile, Agatha herself decided to lean into it.</p><p>She posted a Snapchat story to her friends and family of her looking smug.</p><p>CAPTION: Very tall</p><p>The next snap was a blurry video of Rio hiding her face in her hands with Agatha's laughter in the background.</p><p>Caption: Isn’t she amazing</p><p>Unfortunately, Rio’s suffering wasn’t over.</p><p>As they were about to enter the venue, one last reporter flagged them down.</p><p>"Agatha! Rio! You two look absolutely gorgeous tonight."</p><p>Rio, having learned nothing, panicked again. "Oh, well, um, Agatha looks gorgeous. I’m just existing."</p><p>Agatha, clearly head over heels even if Rio didn’t see it yet, looked at Rio with so much fondness it was sickening. In a way the world took notice off.</p><p>"She looks breathtaking,*" Agatha corrected smoothly, her hand slipping down to hold Rio’s.</p><p>The reporter grinned. “So, Rio, what’s it like dating a world-famous actress?"</p><p>Rio, again, had so many options for how to answer that.</p><p>Instead, she panicked.</p><p>"She eats all my fries."</p><p>A beat of silence.</p><p>Then Agatha, wheezing, turned to the reporter and confirmed, “I do. I absolutely do.”</p><p>The reporter laughed. “So, Agatha, how do you feel about Rio’s red carpet debut tonight?"</p><p>Agatha turned to Rio and gave her the softest look imaginable.</p><p>"I think she’s perfect."</p><p>And that was when Rio’s brain fully shut down.</p><p>Later that night, in the car on the way home, Rio sat with her face buried in her hands.</p><p>"I can never go outside again."</p><p>Agatha, still grinning, already holding tight to one of Rios hands, reached over to squeeze Rio’s thigh with the other. "Sweetheart, you crushed it."</p><p>Rio lifted her head just enough to glare at her. "I called you tall. On national television."</p><p>Agatha giggled. “And I am tall in my heels"</p><p>"You’re average height. I’m taller than you!"</p><p>Agatha just smirked. "Only by an inch."</p><p>Rio groaned dramatically and flopped back against the seat. "Why are you like this?"</p><p>Agatha leaned over at a red light and kissed Rio’s temple. "Because I adore you."</p><p>Rio peeked at her through her fingers. "…Even though I’m a nervous wreck?"</p><p>Agatha smiled. "Especially because of that."</p><p>And just like that, Rio’s humiliation was slightly more bearable.</p><p>At least until she opened Twitter again and saw #TallGate still trending.</p><p>Yeah. She was never living this down.</p>

<p>For most people, wedding season was a joyful time. Love was in the air, romance blossomed, and happy couples danced under twinkling fairy lights.</p><p>For Rio, wedding season was hell.</p><p>As a florist, she was slammed with back-to-back wedding orders, last-minute panicked brides, grooms forgetting their bouquets, and one particularly aggressive mother-in-law who threatened to throw an entire centerpiece at her.</p><p>She barely had time to sleep, let alone think.</p><p>Which was unfortunately how she ended up completely neglecting her relationship with Agatha.</p><p>Not intentionally, of course. Rio loved Agatha. Was so madly in love she thought of little else usually, especially the thought of finally admitting to her that she loved her. She was obsessed with her.</p><p>But Rio had this horrible little trait where, when overwhelmed, instead of talking about it, she just… shut down.</p><p>So, instead of texting Agatha first or calling just to say hi, she only replied when Agatha reached out first.</p><p>She figured it was fine. She wasn’t ignoring Agatha—she was just busy!</p><p>It was not fine.</p><p>Because Agatha was spiraling.</p><p>It was a Friday afternoon when Rio finally had a moment to herself. The shop was quieter than usual, the flowers had been delivered, and the last-minute orders were all handled. For the first time in weeks, she could breathe.</p><p>She collapsed onto the couch in the backroom, phone in hand.</p><p>It started with Bucky sending Rio an extremely pointed Snapchat.</p><p>Bucky: Yo. Fix this.</p><p>Rio: …Fix what?</p><p>Bucky: Agatha is spiraling so hard she just suggested I take her phone away so she doesn’t text you again.</p><p>Rio: …Oh.</p><p>Bucky: She thinks you’re losing interest.</p><p>Rio: WHAT??? NO</p><p>Bucky: Then TELL HER THAT.</p><p>Bucky: Babe. She is convinced you’re gonna break up with her.</p><p>Rio: OH MY GOD</p><p>Bucky: You absolute fool.</p><p>Rio blinked in shock, her stomach sinking.</p><p>She had been so focused on her work, so stressed by the pressure of wedding season, that she hadn't even noticed how much she’d been withdrawing.</p><p>Agatha had been calling and texting as much as she usually did but with Rios one word responses that had become less and less as well. When Rio did reply, it was almost robotic, minimal. Not the affectionate, light-hearted banter that had once come so easily. Agatha deserved more than that.</p><p>Rio: Oh my god. No, no, no.</p><p>She quickly began typing again.</p><p>Rio: Tell her I adore her. I just got so caught up in work I didn’t realize I was doing it. Tell her I’m not going anywhere</p><p>Bucky: Dude, just fix it yourself. I’m not playing therapist here</p><p>Rio: I’m such an idiot</p><p>Bucky: Yeah, but at least you’re self-aware. Now go talk to your girl before she burns her phone overthinking this whole thing</p><p>Rio stared at the screen, feeling like she was suffocating.</p><p>Bucky: Also, you better apologize for being a massive idiot when you finally get to see her</p><p>That did it.</p><p>Rio: Okay, okay. Thanks. I’m calling her now</p><p>She hesitated for a long moment, a lump in her throat. She could feel her heart hammering in her chest as she unlocked her phone and found Agatha’s contact. She clicked on it, stared at the screen, then clicked again.</p><p>It was no use—she needed to do this. For Agatha. For herself.</p><p>She took a deep breath and dialed.</p><p>Agatha picked up on the second ring. Her voice, usually so warm and smooth, was thinner, softer. It cracked when she said her name.</p><p>“Rio? Are you okay?” Agatha asked, a trace of worry threading her voice.</p><p>“I—yeah. I mean, no. Not really,” Rio replied quickly, her voice shaking as she settled herself against the couch. “I’m so sorry, Agatha. I’ve been completely awful.”</p><p>There was a pause on the other end. The soft shuffle of a chair could be heard as Agatha shifted, but she didn’t speak.</p><p>“I’ve been so wrapped up in wedding season and the shop,” Rio continued, her words stumbling over each other. “But that’s not an excuse. I should’ve been there for you. I should’ve talked to you more. I—God, I just went quiet, and you didn’t deserve that.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was quiet when she spoke again. “I thought you were pulling away. I thought maybe you didn’t want to be with me anymore.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, feeling the ache of guilt bloom in her chest. "Agatha...no. That’s the last thing I want. I was just overwhelmed, and I shut down. But that's not your fault."</p><p>“I’m not mad at you,” Agatha said softly, but there was still a sadness to her tone that Rio hated. “I just—I thought you didn’t want this anymore, and I don’t know if I can cope with that.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip, trying to figure out the right words. “I want this. I want you, Agatha.” She paused. “I never should’ve let work make me forget that. I was being an idiot.”</p><p>There was a long silence. Agatha let out a soft breath, as if she was collecting herself. “I don’t want to be the one who’s constantly chasing you,” she said, her voice tinged with vulnerability. “I don’t want to feel like I’m the only one trying.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened. “You’re not the only one, Agatha. You’re not. I’m sorry, okay? I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“I just need you to show me, Rio,” Agatha whispered, her voice barely audible. “I need to feel like I’m a priority too.”</p><p>A tear slipped down Rio’s cheek as she nodded, even though Agatha couldn’t see her. “You are a priority, Agatha. I swear to you.”</p><p>“Then show me,” Agatha said, her voice gaining strength. “Show me that you’re all in.”</p><p>“I will,” Rio promised. “I’ll do whatever it takes.”</p><p>“I need to believe you,” Agatha replied, her voice still soft, but now tinged with hope.</p><p>“I’ll prove it to you. I’ll fix this. I promise.”</p><p>Another long pause followed, but it wasn’t uncomfortable anymore. This time, it was filled with understanding, with the acknowledgment of their shared feelings.</p><p>“I’m not mad at you,” Agatha finally said. “Just...next time, don’t disappear on me, okay?”</p><p>“I won’t,” Rio replied. “I won’t.”</p><p>“I’m holding you to that.”</p><p>“Agatha, I swear.”</p><p>A few minutes later, Rio sent Agatha a snap. It was a simple photo of her sitting in the back room of the shop, a sad but earnest smile on her face. She’d meant what she said.</p><p>Caption: I’m going to fix this, I swear. I adore you. Please don’t ever think I’m pulling away</p><p>Agatha replied instantly with a snap of her own—a picture of her smiling, looking a little more relaxed than she had in days.</p><p>Caption: I believe you</p><p>It was the first step.</p><p>And as Rio wiped away the last of her tears, she knew she’d do anything to make sure it stayed that way. For Agatha.</p><p>It was nearly midnight when Rio finally sat down at home, phone in hand, staring at the chat from Agatha.</p><p>Agatha: Can we talk tomorrow? Just us?</p><p>Her heart sank. Rio had been so sure they were on the same page, so confident that she was making things right after her recent silence. But now, with this simple message, it felt like the floor had fallen out from beneath her.</p><p>Rio couldn’t help it. She began to spiral.</p><p>Talk? She hadn’t meant to mess things up, but what if she had? What if Agatha was done? Maybe she had grown tired of Rio’s awkwardness, her insecurities. She’d had enough of this back-and-forth with Rio being distant, especially when Agatha was so used to being in the spotlight and surrounded by people who understood her.</p><p>Maybe Rio wasn’t enough.</p><p>Her phone buzzed in her hand, and she jumped, pulling her eyes away from the screen for a moment. It was a Snapchat from Alice.</p><p>Alice: You okay? I’ve not heard from you for a while</p><p>Rio stared at the message for a second. Alice always had that sixth sense when it came to knowing when something was up. And, of course, this time wasn’t any different. With a sigh, Rio snapped back quickly.</p><p>Rio: I don’t know, Al. Agatha just sent me a message asking if we can talk tomorrow. But I think she’s just tired of me. Like, maybe I’m just too much for her, you know? She’s probably realized she deserves better.</p><p>She hesitated for a moment before sending another message.</p><p>Rio: I can’t shake the feeling that she’s just over me, I’ve been accidentally ignoring her the last few weeks</p><p>Her phone buzzed almost immediately. Alice’s response was just as fast.</p><p>Alice: Wait, wait, wait...did you even see Agatha’s interview last week?</p><p>Rio frowned, tapping out a quick response.</p><p>Rio: What interview? I didn’t know she had one.</p><p>Alice: Omg, Rio. Are you serious? I thought you kept up with her stuff. In the interview, they asked her about you. And she literally lit up. She gushed about how much she cares about you, like, so much. She talked about how she loves your little quirks, how you make her feel grounded, like a normal person. She even mentioned how much she enjoys being with you, how you’re different than anyone else she’s been with.</p><p>Rio blinked, feeling a rush of warmth flood her chest, but at the same time, a wave of guilt rushed in. How had she missed that?</p><p>She’d barely been keeping up with Agatha’s stories lately, lost in the haze of her own work stress and spiraling thoughts, never mind what she was doing with work. But hearing Alice’s words, seeing them written out like that, made Rio feel worse.</p><p>How had she not even known about it?</p><p>Rio: What? She really said that?</p><p>Alice: Yeah, she literally couldn’t stop smiling when they brought you up. You should go watch it. I’ll send you the link.</p><p>Rio was stunned. She felt the weight of her own insecurity slip just a little bit, but it didn’t take away the knot in her stomach.</p><p>Agatha was clearly still invested in their relationship—maybe more than Rio had given her credit for—but now Rio felt like she had missed the chance to be involved in something that had obviously meant so much to Agatha.</p><p>A few minutes passed before Alice sent over a link to the interview. Rio opened it, fingers trembling, and the first thing she saw was Agatha sitting in front of a camera, looking effortlessly beautiful in a soft beige dress, her eyes twinkling with amusement as the interviewer asked about her relationship.</p><p>“So, Agatha, the public has been buzzing about your love life recently. We’ve seen glimpses of someone special on your social media and as your date for the red carpet. Care to tell us about that?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, her lips curving with a soft fondness. She leaned forward, her tone warm and inviting.</p><p>“Oh, you mean Rio? Yeah, I’m very happy. Rio’s amazing—she’s honestly the best thing that’s ever happened to me. She’s real, you know? I love how she’s grounded. She doesn’t let the fame thing overwhelm her, and she makes me feel...normal.”</p><p>Rio paused the video, her hand trembling as she replayed those words in her mind. I make her feel normal?</p><p>The interviewer continued, clearly intrigued by Agatha’s openness.</p><p>“So, what is it about her that makes her stand out from the rest?”</p><p>Agatha’s smile softened even more, and she took a deep breath before responding.</p><p>“She’s just...different, you know? She’s not intimidated by me. She doesn’t put me on a pedestal, and she’s incredibly patient. She’s quirky, too. Her little weird habits just...they make me smile. Honestly, I don’t know how to explain it, but there’s something special about her. I can’t see myself with anyone else.”</p><p>Rio hit pause again, staring at the screen, her heart pounding in her chest. She can’t see herself with anyone else? Shes said all of this about me while I’ve ignored her?</p><p>Alice’s snap came through just as Rio was digesting everything.</p><p>Alice: See? You’re her person, Rio. She’s obviously mad about you.</p><p>Rio’s stomach still twisted with uncertainty, but Alice’s words gave her a sliver of hope. She had always known Agatha cared about her, but to hear it so clearly from Agatha herself… it was different.</p><p>Despite the little voice in her head that still wondered if she was somehow unworthy, Rio knew that Agatha had always been the kind of person who was truthful to a fault. If Agatha had said all of that in an interview, there was no way she didn’t feel the same way Rio did.</p><p>Still, Rio couldn’t shake the nagging worry.</p><p>Rio: Okay, I’m going to watch the rest of it. But... I’m still nervous about what Agatha meant by talk</p><p>Alice: Trust me, just watch it. You’ll see. And don’t freak out. You two are meant to be together</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, tapping the play button on the interview once more. She had to stop spiraling. Agatha clearly cared, and Rio needed to show her she did too.</p><p>As the interview continued, Rio couldn’t help but feel a little lighter, but she still wasn’t completely convinced. There was still a part of her that feared the conversation Agatha wanted to have.</p><p>But for now, all she could do was watch and take things one step at a time.</p>

<p>Rio’s nerves hadn’t lessened overnight. She had spent the entire day at her shop, busying herself with arrangements, but her mind kept drifting back to Agatha’s message. What did she want to talk about?</p><p>The anticipation of their conversation hung heavy in the air, making her hands tremble as she arranged petals and foliage in the most perfect way she could manage. Each time her phone buzzed, her heart would race, convinced it was Agatha asking for their talk.</p><p>But it wasn’t.</p><p>It was Alice sending her memes, or the occasional delivery notification from her online orders. The silence from Agatha made her heart feel heavy. It was becoming too much to bear, and she was starting to wonder if Agatha had changed her mind about her despite how she spoke in the interview.</p><p>When the doorbell to the shop jingled, Rio’s head snapped up. She didn’t expect to see Agatha, not in person at least. But there she was, standing in the doorway with a cautious smile. Agatha’s expression softened the moment their eyes met, and Rio’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>“Hey, sweetheart,” Agatha said, stepping inside with a gentle sway of her hips. In her arms was an enormous bouquet, not of flowers, but something entirely different—an arrangement of chocolates, caramels, and various sweet treats, all carefully wrapped and tied together with satin ribbons.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio’s voice cracked, as if it hadn’t fully realized she was breathing again.</p><p>Agatha didn’t seem to notice her slight nervousness. She smiled warmly and stepped closer, holding out the gift.</p><p>“These are for you,” Agatha said softly. “I know you’ve been having a stressful time with work.” Her voice was calm, almost hypnotic. There was no tension between them, just warmth, understanding, and a gentleness Rio couldn’t quite explain.</p><p>Rio took the bouquet of treats from Agatha’s hands, her eyes flitting over the assortment. There were chocolate truffles, little caramel squares, and some gourmet cookies. It was thoughtful. It was so her.</p><p>“I—thank you,” Rio whispered, her voice unsteady. She looked at Agatha, feeling suddenly vulnerable.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, her eyes soft and understanding as she took in Rio’s expression. She gently cupped Rio’s cheek, guiding her gaze back to her. “You don’t have to thank me for this, Rio,” Agatha murmured, her thumb tracing gentle circles on Rio’s skin. “Your my girlfriend, I want to support you in anyway I can, especially when I can see how hard things have been for you lately. Ive really missed you.”</p><p>Rio felt the warmth spread through her chest, but it didn’t stop the tears that threatened to well up in her eyes. She wasn’t sure why she was on the verge of tears, but everything felt so overwhelming in the most tender way. She gadnt realised how much she’d been absent until hearing Agatha say she’s missed her.</p><p>Agatha’s kindness, the thoughtfulness behind this small gesture, it all settled in a place deep inside Rio that she hadn’t realized was aching.</p><p>Before she could stop herself, a tear slipped down her cheek. Agatha noticed instantly, her gaze softening even further, a quiet understanding passing between them.</p><p>“Hey, hey,” Agatha whispered, her voice full of affection as she reached out to wipe the tear away. “Don’t cry, honey. It’s okay.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, struggling to compose herself. “I’m sorry... I don’t know why I’m crying. It’s just... I’ve been a shit girlfriend, I’ve been such a mess. I didn’t mean to shut myself off from you, I didn’t mean to make you think I was pulling away, Agatha. I’m just—”</p><p>Agatha cut her off gently, her fingers still on Rio’s cheek as she leaned in, forehead brushing softly against Rio’s. “You don’t need to apologize. You’re not a mess, Rio. You’re just human and I know you’ve had a lot on your plate. But I want you to know—” Her voice was almost a whisper, the sincerity in her words clear as she spoke, “—I care about you. So much.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched, her eyes searching Agatha’s face for any signs of insincerity, but all she saw was compassion, tenderness and although they’d not said the words to each other, love. The knot in her chest slowly started to loosen, the weight she’d been carrying lightening just a little. She swallowed hard, feeling an overwhelming sense of relief.</p><p>Agatha smiled softly, brushing a stray lock of hair behind Rio’s ear. “I get it, Rio. But I want you to know that I’m here for you. You don’t have to shut me out, even if things get overwhelming. We’ll figure it out together.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes for a moment, a single tear slipping down her cheek at the realization of how much Agatha truly meant to her. She leaned into the touch, sighing softly as the tension in her body finally started to melt away.</p><p>“You really mean that?” Rio asked in a voice barely above a whisper, her hands trembling as she set the bouquet of sweets on the counter.</p><p>“Of course I do,” Agatha replied, her voice warm and unwavering. “I want to be there for you, no matter what.” She paused for a moment, looking at Rio with a gentle smile. “In fact, I’ve got something else for you too...”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed. “What?” she asked, trying to hold back the emotion that was still swirling inside her.</p><p>Agatha grinned and reached into her bag, pulling out a small envelope. She handed it to Rio, her eyes twinkling.</p><p>“Open it,” Agatha urged.</p><p>Curious, Rio opened the envelope and pulled out a gift card for a luxurious spa, a full massage session, facial, and everything. It was exactly the kind of thing Rio would never have bought for herself. But Agatha had done it for her, understanding that she’d been working too hard, neglecting herself.</p><p>“I figured you could use a little relaxation,” Agatha said with a teasing smile, her eyes glinting. “Just you, make a day of it, just take some pictures for me.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh at that. Her heart felt lighter than it had in days. The anxiety that had been plaguing her seemed to disappear just by being with Agatha—just by seeing how much Agatha cared.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio said again, this time her voice steadier, full of gratitude. “You really know how to make me feel better.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, pulling Rio closer until she could press a soft, reassuring kiss to her forehead. “You don’t need to thank me, Rio. Just promise me one thing...”</p><p>“Anything,” Rio whispered.</p><p>“Promise me you won’t push me away when things get tough again. We’re a team, remember?” Agatha said softly, her voice full of warmth.</p><p>Rio nodded, feeling more certain than ever. “I promise,” she said, her heart finally at peace.</p><p>As they stood there in the warmth of Agatha’s presence, with the bouquet of treats between them and the soft promise lingering in the air, Rio realized just how lucky she was. Lucky to have found someone who saw her for who she was—flaws, quirks, and all. And most importantly, she felt lucky to have found someone who was willing to stick by her side through it all.</p><p>The next morning, Rio felt a strange mix of excitement and nervousness as she headed to the spa. Agatha had insisted she go on her own, encouraging Rio to truly relax and focus on herself. Rio had been hesitant at first, unsure about being by herself, especially after everything that had happened with Agatha. But after hearing the sincere tone in Agatha’s voice, Rio decided to take the plunge and indulge in some much-needed self-care.</p><p>The spa was tucked away in a tranquil corner of the city, surrounded by lush greenery and an aura of peace that seemed to wash over her the moment she stepped through the door. As she was greeted by a receptionist, Rio could already feel her muscles relaxing, the weight of the past few weeks slipping off her shoulders.</p><p>When she was led to the changing room, she noticed that the spa was buzzing with energy. There were a few whispers here and there, and she caught one staff member looking at her curiously. Rio didn’t think much of it at first, but, the spa’s employees seemed to recognize her. She found herself becoming the subject of soft, polite murmurs as she was ushered into the serene space.</p><p>“Are you... Rio?” one of the attendants asked hesitantly.</p><p>Rio smiled, slightly confused. “Yes?” she answered, wondering how the staff knew her name.</p><p>“We’ve seen you in the news a lot lately, and... well, we had to ask.” The attendant blushed. “You know, with you being Agatha’s... well, her girlfriend.”</p><p>Rio froze. The word felt so surreal to her, like something out of a dream. The idea of being Agatha’s girlfriend still hadn’t fully sunk in. She had been too focused on the whirlwind of everything happening around her to think about the label, but now, hearing it from a stranger’s lips made her feel like she was living in a world she couldn’t quite wrap her head around.</p><p>“Uh… yeah, that’s me,” Rio replied, laughing nervously. “I’m just, you know, normal.”</p><p>Another attendant, a woman with a bright smile, chimed in, “Oh, we know! But we’ve been following you both on social media, and we think it’s so sweet. Agatha is such a beautiful person, and it’s lovely to see her so happy. We’re so excited for you two!”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flushed, and she shifted awkwardly on her feet. She hadn’t quite realized how much Agatha’s public life—and, by extension, her own—was becoming a topic of interest to others. It felt strange to be the subject of questions, to feel like her relationship with Agatha was no longer a private thing.</p><p>But at the same time, the kindness in their voices made her feel accepted. Still, she couldn’t quite shake the surreal sensation that she was somehow more visible than she’d ever wanted to be.</p><p>After her treatments, which included a calming facial, a massage, and a soak in the hot tub, Rio felt utterly relaxed. The spa had done wonders, and for the first time in weeks, she felt like she could breathe again.</p><p>When she left the spa and headed to Agatha’s, Rio was floating, almost weightless. She wasn’t sure if it was the massage or the idea of finally spending time with Agatha, but she felt lighter than she had in ages. As she arrived at Agatha’s house, the familiar warmth greeted her.</p><p>The pool outside glistened in the fading sunlight. Rio kicked off her shoes and wandered into the backyard, where Agatha was waiting for her.</p><p>Agatha had already changed into a simple yet elegant robe, her hair still damp from a shower. She was sitting on one of the lounge chairs, her eyes hidden behind a pair of sunglasses, but Rio could tell she was smiling just by the way her lips twitched.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha said as Rio walked closer. “How was the spa? Did you get to really relax?”</p><p>Rio grinned, her eyes sparkling. “It was amazing. I think I needed that more than I realized. Thank you.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile softened. “I’m glad you did. You deserve it.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, feeling the stillness of the moment between them. Agatha was such a calming presence, and it made Rio feel completely at ease. She walked over to the edge of the pool and dipped a toe into the water, testing its coolness.</p><p>“You’re going to love the water,” Agatha teased. “It’s perfect.”</p><p>Rio laughed, her nerves slowly melting away in Agatha’s presence. “I’m sure it is.”</p><p>She hesitated for a moment before stepping fully into the pool. The cool water surrounded her, and she let out a content sigh as she swam toward the center. She turned back to Agatha, who was watching her intently, clearly amused.</p><p>Without saying anything more, Agatha stood up from the lounge chair and slid into the water, her feet gliding gracefully through the pool. She moved toward Rio with effortless elegance, the water rippling around her.</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but stare. Agatha, even in something as simple as a robe, was effortlessly beautiful.</p><p>Agatha stopped in front of her, her eyes full of warmth. “Come here,” she said softly, reaching out for Rio’s hand.</p><p>Rio took it without thinking, and Agatha pulled her close. She guided Rio to float on her back in the water, the sounds of the world muffled by the serenity of the pool.</p><p>Agatha settled herself beside Rio, her back against the edge of the pool as they both floated together. Rio could feel Agatha’s gentle presence beside her, the soft splash of water surrounding them. She wasn’t sure what it was about the moment—whether it was the calm of the water or the closeness between them—but Rio felt incredibly safe and at peace.</p><p>They stayed like that for what felt like hours, floating in the pool together, the sky shifting from shades of pink and purple to the deep indigo of night. The stars above twinkled softly, and Rio couldn’t help but think how lucky she was. She was here, with Agatha.</p><p>“Do you ever think about the future?” Rio asked quietly, breaking the silence.</p><p>Agatha turned her head to look at her, her expression thoughtful. “I think about it all the time.” She paused before adding with a small smile, “But with you, it feels different. I’m not worried about it. I’m just... happy to be here, with you.”</p><p>Rio smiled back, feeling her heart swell at Agatha’s words. “Yeah... me too.”</p><p>And for the first time in a long while, Rio let herself truly believe it. Everything that had happened—her spiraling doubts, the anxiety about their relationship—suddenly didn’t seem as important. It was just them, in the pool, floating together in perfect peace.</p><p>“Hey, I’m really glad we’re together,” Rio whispered, feeling a warmth in her chest she couldn’t explain.</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Me too, Rio. Me too.”</p><p>And for that moment, nothing else in the world mattered.</p>

<p>The news came one evening as Agatha sat on the couch, flipping through a script for her upcoming film. Rio had just finished a long day at the flower shop and had made her way over to Agatha’s house, as was becoming their usual routine. Agatha smiled when she saw Rio walk through the door, exhaustion fading from her face at the sight of her.</p><p>"Hey, my love," Agatha said softly, patting the space next to her on the couch. "I’ve got some news."</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows furrowed at the pet name, as she dropped her bag by the door and joined her on the couch. "What’s up? You look like you’ve got a heavy heart," she said, settling next to Agatha and giving her hand a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>Agatha sighed, looking down at the script in her hands. "I just got a call from the studio," she said, her voice slightly trembling. "They’re sending me across a few different countries to film the next part of my project. It’s going to take a couple of months."</p><p>Rio blinked in surprise. "Wait, what? You’re going away for a couple of months?" she asked, her voice tinged with a mix of disbelief and sadness. "That’s... that's a lot."</p><p>Agatha nodded, rubbing her hands together nervously. "Yeah, it’s been in the works for a while. But I didn’t want to tell you until everything was confirmed. I’ll be filming in Spain, Italy, and then a few weeks in Japan. It’s a huge opportunity, but..." She trailed off, looking at Rio with a sad smile. "I don’t know how I’m going to do this without you."</p><p>Rio’s heart sank. She had known Agatha’s career meant long hours, but a few months away felt like a lifetime. Her stomach twisted in anxiety as she reached out to cup Agatha’s face, gently guiding her to look up. "I’ll miss you too," she said softly, trying to keep the tears at bay. "But you’re going to kill it. You’ve always been so amazing at what you do."</p><p>Agatha smiled through her sadness, brushing her fingers against Rio’s cheek. "I know. But it’s not just about the filming. I’m going to miss you" she said, her voice breaking slightly. "I’ll miss waking up next to you. I’ll miss seeing you every day, talking about the most random stuff. And I’ll miss the way you laugh when I do something ridiculous."</p><p>Rio’s heart squeezed as she realized just how much Agatha was going to miss her, too. She could see the vulnerability in Agatha’s eyes, the same vulnerability that Agatha had rarely shown to anyone, even in the quiet moments when they were alone.</p><p>"I’m going to miss you so much, Agatha," Rio whispered, brushing a few stray strands of hair behind Agatha’s ear. "But we’ll make it work. We’ll figure it out."</p><p>Agatha shook her head slightly. "I just... I wish I didn’t have to leave. I don’t want to go, but I have to."</p><p>There was a long pause as both women sat in the stillness of the room, the weight of the situation settling in. Rio felt her chest tighten, the thought of being apart from Agatha for months weighing on her. "What about Remi and Señor Scratchy?" she asked, trying to keep the mood light. "Are they coming with you?"</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled into a small smile. "Of course. They’re my emotional support team," she said, voice a little lighter. "I can’t leave them behind. Remi will be a menace if she’s not with me."</p><p>Rio chuckled softly, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. "They’re lucky," she said quietly. "I wish I could come with you."</p><p>Agatha turned to her, her expression soft and understanding. "I know. I wish you could be there, too. But I promise, when I get back... we’ll make up for lost time, okay?"</p><p>Rio nodded, but her heart ached at the thought of how many moments they were going to miss together. "Okay," she whispered, her voice small.</p><p>Agatha leaned in and kissed her forehead, lingering for a moment before pulling back. "I’m going to miss you so much, Rio. More than I can even say."</p><p>Rio’s eyes welled up with tears, but she held them back, not wanting to make the moment any harder than it already was. "I’m going to miss you too. I just wish this was easier."</p><p>The next few days were filled with a mix of bittersweet moments. They spent every minute they could together, making plans for video calls and long-distance communication. Agatha promised to send Rio little things to remind her of her girlfriend —photos, voice notes, and whatever else she could think of.</p><p>The night before Agatha was supposed to leave, they sat on the couch together, curled up in blankets. Remi and Señor Scratchy were both lounging around them, adding a sense of comfort to the space. Rio didn’t want to talk about it, but Agatha kept bringing it up, her anxiety creeping in.</p><p>"I’m so sorry about all of this," Agatha said, her voice thick with emotion. "I know this is going to be hard, and I hate putting this on you."</p><p>Rio shook her head, holding Agatha’s hand tightly. "It’s not on me. It’s not your fault you’re amazing at your job," she said with a small smile. "I’ll be fine. I promise. I just wish we didn’t have to be apart."</p><p>Agatha leaned into her, resting her head on Rio’s shoulder. "I know. But I’m going to make it up to you. When I get back, I want to take you somewhere special, just the two of us. We’ll make memories that’ll last a lifetime."</p><p>Rio smiled, her heart swelling with affection. "I’ll be counting down the days," she said softly, kissing Agatha’s temple.</p><p>The next morning, as Agatha packed her bags to leave, she kissed Rio goodbye, taking a moment to hold her close before slipping away. "I’ll be back before you know it," she said, her voice soft, almost like a promise. "I love you."</p><p>She said it first. Agatha actually said it.</p><p>"I love you too," Rio whispered, watching as Agatha drove away, her heart torn between longing and the excitement that Agatha would return to her soon.</p><p>For now, all Rio could do was hold on to the memories of their time together, knowing that their love would only grow stronger, even from miles away.</p><p>As the days passed, Rio found herself slipping back into a rhythm without Agatha physically by her side. The mornings were quieter, and she couldn’t help but feel the empty space beside her in bed. It was only the second day after Agatha had left for Italy, but it already felt like too long.</p><p>However, Agatha’s constant presence on her Snapchat made it a little easier to breathe. It was the only way Rio could stay close to her during this time. Agatha had promised to stay in touch every night, and true to her word, she did. Rio found herself eagerly awaiting each Snap from Agatha, as if each one was a lifeline to bridge the distance between them.</p><p>Agatha’s stories were filled with stunning views of Italy, from the charming cobblestone streets of Rome to the winding vineyards in the countryside. The landscape was breathtaking, but Rio’s focus was always on Agatha—how the actress looked while navigating these new experiences, how effortlessly beautiful she seemed in every snap, and how she made even the simplest moments feel like magic. One night, Agatha posted a picture of herself sipping a glass of red wine on a terrace overlooking a sunset-drenched landscape.</p><p>Caption: Wish you were here. The view’s incredible, but I’d rather be with you.</p><p>Rio’s heart skipped at the words, and she immediately replied with a message: I wish I could be there with you too. I miss you already</p><p>Each time Agatha posted, Rio would immediately watch the story, her fingers hovering over the screen as if she could touch Agatha through the phone. Sometimes, Agatha would give her a behind-the-scenes peek at the film set. One day, she shared a quick video of herself and the cast goofing around between takes, her laughter infectious. The lighting was perfect, and Rio couldn’t help but smile at how genuinely happy Agatha seemed.</p><p>Yet, as much as she loved seeing Agatha so engaged with her work, Rio felt a pang of jealousy. Agatha was surrounded by people—people who got to experience her laughter and company in person. Meanwhile, Rio could only watch from afar, living for the moments when Agatha would call her at the end of the day.</p><p>And every night, like clockwork, Agatha would call.</p><p>The phone would ring, and Rio’s heart would skip a beat each time. She would answer with a breathless, “Hey, you,” before Agatha’s warm, familiar voice filled her ear.</p><p>“How was your day?” Agatha would ask, her tone soft and affectionate, as if they were right next to each other.</p><p>“It was good, but it’s been a little quiet without you,” Rio would reply, the ache of missing Agatha apparent in her voice.</p><p>Agatha would laugh lightly, the sound comforting in Rio’s ears. “I miss you too. But I’ve got some funny behind-the-scenes stories for you.”</p><p>Sometimes it would be a video of Agatha and the crew taking a break. The sun would be setting behind her, casting a golden glow on her features. She’d turn the camera toward herself, her face illuminated, and say, “This is what happens when you work with a bunch of goofballs.” She would then turn the camera to a group of crew members laughing, or a quick shot of a cat on set that had become the unofficial mascot. Agatha’s stories never failed to make Rio smile, and she’d reply with enthusiastic messages, teasing Agatha about her "adorable" crew or how much she wished she could join them.</p><p>One night, though, Agatha’s snap was different. Instead of her usual cheerful demeanor, Agatha posted a story of herself sitting alone in a hotel room, the lights dimmed, a glass of wine in her hand, and her expression contemplative. The caption simply read: I hate not being able to share this with you. I miss you more than I expected</p><p>Rio’s heart sank at the sight of her, but it also filled her with warmth. I miss you too. It’s been tough, but I know we’re getting through it.</p><p>Rio typed in response, her fingers trembling slightly as she sent the message.</p><p>Minutes later, Agatha replied, her voice cracking slightly through the voice note. "I know. I just... I hate that I’m here, doing all this cool stuff, but I don’t have you to share it with. I keep thinking about what you’d say or how you’d react to everything. I want to be able to show you these things in person, not just over a screen."</p><p>Rio felt her throat tighten as she listened to Agatha’s message. She wanted so badly to be there with her, to hold her and reassure her. “When you come back,” Rio replied, her words slow and thoughtful. “We’ll make up for all of this time. I’m so proud of you, though, Agatha. You’re doing amazing things.”</p><p>A few seconds passed before Agatha responded again, this time more upbeat. “I can’t wait. And you’re right, I know it’s just a couple of months. But it feels like forever when I’m thinking about you.”</p><p>After the call ended, Rio sat in silence for a few minutes, lost in thought. As much as she missed Agatha, hearing her voice, even through the phone, was a balm to her soul. She knew that no matter how hard this distance was, Agatha’s commitment to their relationship was clear.</p><p>But the loneliness was real. Rio found herself turning to Agatha’s Snap stories in the quiet moments, watching Agatha’s life unfold in a way she could only observe. She would scroll through the posts, often replaying them, each one a reminder of the beautiful woman who had changed her life.</p><p>One morning, Agatha posted a story of herself enjoying a simple breakfast outside a café, the Italian sun shining down on her. Mornings in Italy but miss my person she wrote, a hint of sadness in the message. Rio, feeling the weight of the distance between them, replied immediately: I wish I could get there. But we’ll make new memories when you’re back. I promise.</p><p>She sat there for a while, her phone in her hands, just thinking about Agatha. Despite the miles between them, Rio couldn’t shake the feeling that their bond was growing stronger, even through the screen. Agatha had a way of making Rio feel special, even from afar.</p><p>At night, when Rio got into bed, she would send Agatha goodnight snaps. They’d sometimes be goofy, sometimes sweet—like one where Rio was holding up a ridiculous stuffed bear and saying, “I got you a souvenir from the flower shop!” Agatha would reply with a snap of her own, showing a stuffed dog that she had picked up for Remi, adding, “Got Remi one too! But don’t get jealous.”</p><p>It wasn’t perfect. It wasn’t what they both wanted, but it was enough. It had to be enough for now. And somehow, Rio felt like Agatha’s promise—that they would make it through this time apart—was something she could hold onto.</p><p>As the days wore on, Rio found herself anxiously awaiting the nightly phone calls, the moments of connection that kept her grounded. And slowly, she came to realize that distance, no matter how far, couldn’t break the bond they were building.</p>

<p>It had been a month since Agatha had left for filming, and Rio had gotten used to the quiet mornings without her. Agatha’s Snap stories, full of the stunning Italian coastline and behind-the-scenes moments from her set, had become Rio’s daily dose of joy. She loved seeing Remi frolicking in the sand, and Agatha, who had gotten a beautiful sun-kissed tan, looked more relaxed than Rio had ever seen her.</p><p>On one particular morning, Agatha posted a video of herself lounging on the beach, Remi happily rolling around in the sand beside her. She was wearing a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses perched on her nose, and a warm smile on her face.</p><p>“You’re really missing out, Rio. I think you’d like this beach, but I guess I’ll save it for when you’re here. Remi's having the best time though.”* Her voice was lighthearted and carefree. Rio smiled, watching the video multiple times and sending a quick reply.</p><p>Rio: I can’t wait to come visit you. The beach looks amazing. I wish I was there with you both.</p><p>Rio was still feeling the ache of missing her but was doing her best to stay occupied with work and her daily routine. The shop had kept her busy, and she loved the calming scent of flowers that surrounded her during the day. But as much as she enjoyed her work, her thoughts were still consumed by Agatha and the distance between them.</p><p>However, the quiet routine Rio had settled into was abruptly interrupted when she caught sight of the tabloids at the coffee shop on her way to work one morning. Her stomach dropped when she saw the headline: Is Agatha’s New Relationship on the Rocks? Sources Suggest Rio and Agatha Have Split!</p><p>There was a picture of Rio, taken when she was on her way to work—her face scrunched in concentration, brows furrowed, and her posture slightly hunched as she walked, looking tired and preoccupied. The image made her look like she was going through something, and the tabloid had twisted it into a narrative that didn’t match reality. Beneath the photo was the article, full of speculation and rumors about their relationship. The tabloid questioned whether Rio’s ‘moodiness’ was a sign that things were falling apart with Agatha, feeding the public’s hunger for drama.</p><p>Rio froze, holding the paper in her hands, her heart sinking into her stomach. She couldn’t understand how something so mundane could be twisted into a headline like that. She quickly discarded the paper in a nearby trash bin, feeling her chest tighten with anxiety. She hadn’t said anything to Agatha about the rumors, but now she was sure they’d reach her sooner or later. The last thing she wanted was for Agatha to see that nonsense about them. It made her feel exposed, vulnerable, and helpless.</p><p>She couldn’t keep it to herself. So, she grabbed her phone, opening Snapchat and sending Agatha a quick message.</p><p>Rio: Hey, I don’t know if you’ve seen it, but there’s a rumor in the tabloids saying we’ve split... thanks for telling me lol. Just ignore it if you see it.</p><p>Her thumb hovered over the send button, her fingers trembling slightly as she tapped it and sent the message.</p><p>Within minutes, Agatha’s reply came through.</p><p>Agatha: I haven’t seen it yet, but I don’t care what they say. I know what we have. It’s just noise. Don’t let it get to you, okay? I miss you like crazy</p><p>Rio’s heart swelled at Agatha’s words, the reassurance washing over her.</p><p>Rio: I miss you too... a lot. I just feel kind of weird about it all, you know? They’ve got my picture and made it look like I’m miserable</p><p>Rio sent a photo back of herself standing in her shop, holding a bouquet of flowers and smiling.</p><p>Caption: This is me today, okay? Not miserable</p><p>Agatha responded almost immediately.</p><p>Agatha: I know you’re not miserable. I see you every day in my heart. Don’t let some weird tabloid mess with your head. It’s just the press trying to create drama where there isn’t any</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, feeling the weight lift slightly off her shoulders. She typed back.</p><p>Rio: You’re right. I know you’d never do that to me. I just don’t want the world getting involved in our relationship. It feels... invasive</p><p>Agatha’s reply was simple but heartfelt.</p><p>Agatha: I understand. It’s hard, I know. But we’re stronger than that. We’re good, Rio. I promise. I love you</p><p>There was a voice note attached to the message, and when Rio played it, she heard Agatha’s voice, low and soothing. “Don’t let them take away our peace. You’re mine, and I’m yours. That’s all that matters, love you sweetheart.”</p><p>Rio felt a wave of warmth spread through her at her words. It made the tabloids feel small and insignificant, like they didn’t even deserve a second thought. But still, the emotional toll was there. Rio had been living a quieter life before Agatha, and now, suddenly, she was thrust into the public eye.</p><p>And though she loved Agatha, the attention that came with their relationship was overwhelming.</p><p>Later that evening, Agatha sent a snap of herself on set in a beautiful Italian villa, with Remi in the background, playing in the garden. *“You’d love this place. Remi's already found the best napping spots. How’s your day been?”</p><p>Rio responded, feeling more connected to Agatha than ever.</p><p>Rio: Busy, but I’ve been thinking about you a lot today. Miss you more than I can say.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat as she saw Agatha’s reply.</p><p>Agatha: I miss you too. Can’t wait for this shoot to be over so I can be with you again. It’s not the same without you here</p><p>Rio’s phone buzzed with another message. It was a message from Alice.</p><p>Alice: Girl, don’t stress over that tabloid nonsense. You and Agatha are solid. She’s got your bac</p><p>Rio chuckled at the message, feeling a little better. She snapped a picture of herself holding up her phone with a peace sign and sent it to Agatha.</p><p>Caption: Getting through the chaos with you in my corner</p><p>Agatha’s reply was quick.</p><p>Agatha: Always, sweetheart. You and me against the world.</p><p>Despite the tabloids, despite the chaos, Rio felt grounded in Agatha’s words. She realized then that it didn’t matter what anyone else thought. Their relationship was real, and no amount of rumors or paparazzi could change that. It was just her and Agatha, and nothing else mattered.</p><p>A few days after the tabloid rumors about Rio and Agatha started circulating, the media frenzy seemed to intensify. It wasn’t just the paparazzi anymore; talk shows, gossip blogs, and even interviews with Agatha's co-stars began to touch on the subject of her relationship. But this time, it wasn’t Agatha speaking out about the rumors—it was Bucky.</p><p>Bucky had his own talk show appearance coming up, and Rio was sitting in her apartment when she saw a snippet from the show flash across her feed. The headline read: Bucky Defends Agatha’s Relationship with Rio: ‘She’s Head Over Heels!’</p><p>Rio felt a knot form in her stomach. She clicked on the clip and started watching.</p><p>On screen, Bucky was seated comfortably in the talk show’s plush chair, laughing and chatting with the host, a friendly older woman who had a reputation for being blunt.</p><p>Host: “So, Bucky, let’s talk about your friends. We’ve seen Agatha looking absolutely head over heels for her girlfriend, Rio. But recently, there have been rumors swirling about them—rumors that suggest they might have split. You’ve known Agatha for years now, so what’s really going on?”</p><p>Bucky’s face dropped into something more serious, a shift that had the audience quieting down.</p><p>Bucky: “Rumors are exactly that—rumors. I mean, come on. You know how tabloids work, right? They create drama where there isn’t any. Of course Rio looked miserable in that picture. You’d be miserable too if your girlfriend, who you’re head over heels for, was filming abroad for months on end. I’m also miserable. Our favorite girl is in Italy right now, and we miss her like crazy. But, I’ll tell you this—Agatha is crazy about Rio. They’re not breaking up. If anything, they’re stronger than ever.”</p><p>The host raised an eyebrow, clearly amused by Bucky’s sincerity.</p><p>Host: “But you’re saying it’s just the distance making things look worse than they are?”</p><p>Bucky nodded vigorously, leaning forward in his chair.</p><p>Bucky: “Exactly. I’ve known Agatha for years, and let me tell you, she’s never been like this with anyone. I’ve seen her with other people, and it was never this serious. She talks about Rio all the time, she adores her. And Rio? She’s just as into Agatha as Agatha is into her. Sure, the distance is tough, but it’s temporary. Trust me, when Agatha comes back, you’ll see it in person—the connection they have is undeniable. They’re solid.”</p><p>Rio’s heart fluttered as she listened to Bucky’s words. It was so reassuring to hear him speak so highly of her and Agatha. She didn’t realize until then how much she needed someone to have her back in this mess. It wasn’t just Agatha’s voice she wanted to hear; Bucky, who knew Agatha so well, was validating their relationship in a way that made her feel less alone.</p><p>She quickly grabbed her phone, snapping Bucky a message on Snapchat.</p><p>Rio: You have no idea how much that means to me. Seriously, thank you. It’s been tough, but hearing you say that really helped</p><p>Bucky’s response came almost immediately, his familiar sense of humor coming through despite the serious topic.</p><p>Bucky: Of course, I’ve got your back. Agatha’s head over heels for you, and anyone who thinks otherwise is a damn fool. Besides, if anyone’s miserable around here, it’s me. I’m stuck with no Agatha to pester. So, yeah, I’m definitely feeling the absence too. 😅</p><p>Rio laughed softly, feeling a warmth in her chest. She quickly typed back.</p><p>Rio: It’s been a long month. Agatha’s not here, and it feels like everything’s just off. I miss her so much</p><p>Bucky: I know, it’s hard. But you’re doing great, Rio. Agatha’s not going anywhere, and neither am I. And hey, once she’s back, we’ll throw a welcome home party and I’ll make sure you both are properly celebrated, alright?</p><p>Rio smiled, feeling more grounded in her own heartache.</p><p>Rio: Thanks, Bucky. You’re really making this whole thing easier. I needed to hear that today.</p><p>Bucky: Anytime. And listen, if the tabloids keep messing with you, just let me know. I’ll take care of them, too. No one messes with Agatha and Rio on my watch. Got it?</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh at how fierce Bucky was. She felt so much more at ease knowing she had him on her side.</p><p>Rio: You’re a good friend, Bucky. Really appreciate you. We need to all hang out when she’s back—Remi too.</p><p>Bucky: Remi’s got her own fan club now, so don’t be surprised when she demands a treat every five minutes. But I’m all in on the hangout, as long as I get to see you two making out like a couple of lovebirds in front of me. Kidding. Or am I? 😜</p><p>Rio giggled, feeling a little lighter after the conversation.</p><p>Rio: Yeah, no kissing in front of you, thanks! 😂 I’ll pass on that.</p><p>Bucky: Alright, alright. But when she gets back, we’re having a proper catch-up, okay? You, me, Agatha, Remi and Senor Scratchy. I’ll bring the margaritas</p><p>Rio: Deal. And again, thank you for everything. You really helped today.</p><p>Bucky: Always. Can’t wait to see you soon</p><p>As Rio put down her phone, she felt an overwhelming sense of relief. Hearing Bucky speak so confidently about her and Agatha was exactly what she needed. It made her believe in their relationship again, reminded her that no matter how difficult the situation seemed, Agatha cared for her deeply, and so did the people closest to them.</p><p>She sent Agatha a quick message after chatting with Bucky.</p><p>Rio: I heard what Bucky said on his talk show. I love that you have such amazing friends in your life. I miss you so much. Can’t wait to see you again soon.</p><p>Agatha’s reply came almost instantly.</p><p>Agatha: I miss you more than words can say, Rio. We’ll be together soon. Don’t let the tabloids get to you. Just hold on for a little while longer. I promise, it’ll be worth it.</p><p>Rio smiled at her phone, feeling a renewed sense of connection despite the distance. The wait wasn’t easy, but it was more than manageable knowing that Agatha and Bucky were in her corner.</p>

<p>A few days after their heart-to-heart conversations, Rio was back to her routine. Work was busy with wedding season still in full swing, but the longing for Agatha never really faded. Each day, she would check her Snapchat for updates from Agatha, smiling at her posts, watching her adventures in Spain unfold. The distance was hard, but Agatha had been reassuring her in every way possible—nightly calls, sweet messages, and even the occasional unexpected snap of her laughing with Remi or soaking up the sun.</p><p>One evening, Rio was wrapping up her day at the shop, arranging flowers for an event, when her phone buzzed with a notification. She picked it up, expecting it to be a message from Alice or a reminder about a wedding. But when she opened the notification, her heart skipped a beat.</p><p>It was a Snapchat from Agatha.</p><p>Agatha: I miss you so much. I’ve been thinking about you constantly. So, I’ve made a decision…</p><p>Rio’s heart raced as she opened the snap. It was a picture of Agatha sitting in a chic, sunlit café, a playful smile on her lips. In her hand was an envelope with her name written on it.</p><p>Caption: I know how much we’ve both been missing each other. So I did something a little crazy… I’ve got a surprise for you. Check your email in 10 minutes</p><p>Rio blinked, completely caught off guard. She stared at the snap for a few moments, replaying it over and over in her mind. Her emotions were a mixture of excitement and confusion. What was Agatha up to? What surprise? She’d never expected Agatha to do something like this. Her heart pounded as she quickly switched to her email app, awaiting the mysterious message.</p><p>Ten minutes later, she received an email notification from Agatha, subject line: A Surprise for You.</p><p>Rio’s fingers trembled as she opened it.</p><p>Inside the email was a PDF attachment, and the moment she opened it, her breath caught in her throat. It was a plane ticket—an all-expenses-paid round trip to Spain for the next week.</p><p>The email itself read:</p><p>Rio, I can’t stand being away from you any longer. I’ve taken the liberty of booking you a ticket to come out here for a week. You deserve a break, and I want us to have the time we’ve been missing. I’ll be here waiting. I know it’s short notice, but I hope you can take a little time off and come. I want to show you Spain, show you a piece of my life here. I can’t wait to have you with me. Love, Agatha.</p><p>Rio felt a rush of emotion hit her all at once. She stared at the screen in disbelief. Agatha was flying her out to Spain. The thought of being with Agatha, exploring Spain, and just being in her arms again made her giddy with excitement. But then doubt crept in. Could she really leave her shop for a week? Would it be too much?</p><p>Before Rio could overthink it, her phone buzzed again—another Snapchat from Agatha.</p><p>Agatha: Don’t think about it too much. You’ve been working so hard. You deserve this, and I want you here. You’re the most important thing right now. Just say yes, please.</p><p>Rio’s heart melted as she read Agatha’s words. She felt her anxieties melt away. Agatha was so sure, so kind, and so determined to make this happen. Rio could feel her affection in every message, every gesture, and it was impossible to resist.</p><p>Rio quickly replied on Snapchat, her fingers flying across the screen.</p><p>Rio: You’re insane! But… I can’t say no. I’ll be there. I can’t wait to see you. You’ve seriously outdone yourself, Agatha. I’m so lucky to have you.</p><p>Agatha’s response was immediate.</p><p>Agatha: I’m the lucky one. I’ll be waiting at the airport when you land. See you soon, my love.</p><p>Rio felt a surge of joy and excitement that she couldn’t contain. She called Alice immediately, her voice trembling with happiness.</p><p>“Alice! You won’t believe this,” Rio exclaimed. “Agatha just booked me a ticket to Spain! I’m going to see her in two days! I can’t believe it.”</p><p>Alice’s voice was full of laughter. “I told you she was crazy about you! That’s so sweet of her. Honestly, you two are giving me all the feels. I hope you’re ready for some serious romantic adventures in Spain!”</p><p>Rio couldn’t stop smiling, feeling giddy. “I know, right? I just… I can’t believe she did this. I feel like I’m dreaming. But I’m also nervous, I haven’t traveled like this in ages.”</p><p>Alice chuckled. “You’ll be fine. Just enjoy every second of it. She’s your person, Rio. Go and have fun with her.”</p><p>After hanging up with Alice, Rio spent the next hour packing. She’d never traveled so spontaneously before, and her mind raced with a hundred thoughts. What should she wear? How was she supposed to act in front of Agatha’s world in Spain? She took a deep breath and reminded herself that Agatha wanted this. She wanted to be with her. Everything would be fine.</p><p>The day of her flight, Rio made her way to the airport. Her stomach fluttered with excitement and nerves. She had a good feeling about this trip. It felt like the start of something special, and maybe even the next chapter in their relationship.</p><p>As her flight landed in Spain, Rio’s heart raced. She followed the signs for arrivals, scanning the crowd. And then, she saw Agatha.</p><p>She looked stunning—radiant, relaxed, and so effortlessly beautiful. She was waiting at the exit with a sign that read “Mi amor."</p><p>Rio felt tears prick at her eyes as she walked toward her, and Agatha’s face lit up as she caught sight of her.</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha exclaimed, rushing forward and pulling her into a tight embrace.</p><p>Rio hugged her back, the world around them fading away. She was finally with Agatha again, and it felt like everything was exactly where it was supposed to be.</p><p>“I can’t believe I’m here,” Rio murmured against Agatha’s shoulder. “You’re real. This is real.”</p><p>Agatha pulled back slightly, cupping Rio’s face with her hands. “You’re here, and that’s all that matters. Welcome to Spain, my love. Let’s make the most of this week.”</p><p>Rio smiled, tears threatening to spill over, but she was too happy to care. She was here, and Agatha was everything she could have dreamed of.</p><p>The week ahead promised to be full of adventure, passion, and the kind of connection they had both been longing for. As they walked out into the warm Spanish night, Rio couldn’t help but feel like her life was beginning to fall into place, and it was all because Agatha had decided to bring her along for the ride.</p><p>As Rio and Agatha spent the week in Spain, their Snapchat stories became a window into their shared adventure. Agatha had prepared an itinerary of romantic and fun excursions, and Rio couldn’t have been more excited. The days were filled with exploring the picturesque streets of Barcelona, sunbathing by the Mediterranean, and indulging in delicious tapas. Agatha’s Snapchat was constantly updating, each post more beautiful than the last, capturing the stunning landscapes, their laughter, and the undeniable chemistry between them.</p><p>Snap : Hola from Barcelona!</p><p>A video of Agatha and Rio walking hand-in-hand down La Rambla, the lively street lined with shops and performers. Agatha’s smile was radiant, her sunglasses perched atop her head. Rio, a few steps behind her, was beaming, her face flushed from the warmth of the sun. Agatha playfully panned the camera over the crowds of tourists and street performers, the iconic architecture of Gaudí’s buildings just visible in the distance.</p><p>Snap : I brought my girl to Park Güell</p><p>A picture of them sitting on the colorful mosaic bench, overlooking the city. Rio had her arms wrapped around Agatha’s waist, their faces close together, enjoying the warmth of the sun and each other’s company.</p><p>Caption: She’s breathtaking—inside and out. 💛</p><p>Snap: Fell in love with Barcelona.</p><p>A video from the top of Montjuïc, showing the stunning panoramic views of the city and the Mediterranean Sea. The two were laughing, with Agatha’s arm around Rio’s shoulders. Rio, a little nervous but giddy, gave the camera a quick wave.</p><p>The next day, the pair headed out to explore more cultural spots.</p><p>Snap: Got lost in the history of the Gothic Quarter!</p><p>A picture of Rio and Agatha standing in front of the Barcelona Cathedral, the intricate gothic architecture towering behind them. Rio snapped a shot of Agatha smiling brightly as she spun in the street, laughing at how confused they both had been about directions. Rio’s hair was slightly tousled, her cheeks pink from the summer heat.</p><p>Snap: And now we’re eating all the tapas, because why not?</p><p>A video of Rio trying to navigate a plate of patatas bravas, giggling as she failed to get a perfect bite without spilling the sauce everywhere. Agatha laughed alongside her, snapping a quick shot of Rio’s messy face.</p><p>Rio wiped her chin and mock-gasped. “I don’t think I’m cut out for tapas…” Agatha’s voice rang out in the background, “You’re cute, don’t worry about it.”</p><p>Snap: Winding down at the beach 🏖️</p><p>A serene photo of them on a private beach, the turquoise waves gently rolling in. Agatha was lying on her back with her sunglasses on, while Rio rested on her stomach, her head nestled into Agatha’s chest. The sun was setting behind them, casting a golden glow over everything. Rio posted it on her own Snapchat too.</p><p>Caption: Here. With her. ❤️</p><p>Rio’s Snapchat Story was also filled with her time in Spain.</p><p>A photo of Rio smiling shyly in front of the famous La Sagrada Familia. Agatha had managed to capture Rio with the grand church in the background, and the sunlight made Rio’s hair almost glow. The way Agatha had taken the shot made Rio feel like she was a part of something magical.</p><p>Rio tagged Agathas public instagram in the post, captioning it: *“I’m so in awe of everything here. And her. 💖</p><p>Snap: Woke up to this view this morning 😍</p><p>A video showing the view from the hotel balcony—endless blue sky, sun shimmering over the rooftops of Barcelona. Agatha’s laugh could be heard as she called out to Rio, who had clearly just woken up, her messy hair and sleepy eyes a stark contrast to the picture-perfect surroundings. Rio snapped Agatha as she leaned out over the balcony, her hair blowing in the wind.</p><p>Snap: I can’t get enough of these churros.</p><p>A video showing Rio taking a bite of the churros, dipping it into chocolate sauce while Agatha encouraged her to “live her best life.” The video ended with Rio laughing, her face covered in chocolate and Agatha playfully wiping her face with a napkin. Rio could hear her voice, “Why does it always end up like this with you?”</p><p>As the week went on, the pair took a trip to the southern coast of Spain to explore Seville and Marbella. Their Snapchat stories chronicled their visits to ancient ruins, Roman baths, and cozy local markets. Each snap radiated their joy, their undeniable connection growing stronger by the day.</p><p>But, just as they were finally settling into their vacation bliss, the paparazzi caught wind of their whirlwind holiday.</p><p>One afternoon, while Agatha and Rio were walking hand in hand through a bustling market in Seville, they were surrounded by flashing cameras. The papparazzi had somehow found them in the crowd, and before either of them could react, the photos were taken.</p><p>She was quick to post a photo of her and Rio laughing amidst the chaos of the paparazzi to her own snapchat.</p><p>Caption: Guess they finally found us... 😅</p><p>Rio, still trying to process the sudden invasion of their privacy, snapped a selfie of her wide-eyed face to her own snapchat.</p><p>Caption: Not how I imagined this day going... but, here we are</p><p>The next morning, after the flash of cameras died down, Agatha and Rio decided to take a moment for themselves. They went for a walk in the countryside just outside Marbella, where the view of rolling hills and vineyards was peaceful and serene. Rio couldn’t help but feel both excited and overwhelmed by the situation. She was just a small-town florist, trying to navigate the whirlwind of Agatha’s world.</p><p>But Agatha, sensing Rio’s nerves, took her hand and whispered, “Don’t worry about them. This is our time, not theirs.”</p><p>They posted more photos, this time on a quiet vineyard tour. Agatha posted a photo of her and Rio with glasses of wine, their faces radiating happiness. The caption was simple: Here’s to us. 🍷❤️</p><p>Despite the paparazzi chaos, the pair found solace in each other’s company. Agatha, protective and loving, made sure Rio felt at ease, reminding her that their connection was more important than the cameras flashing around them. And for Rio, it was clear: this was a moment in time that she would cherish forever. Even though the world was watching, Agatha made sure she felt like the only person in it.</p>

<p>Rio sat at her kitchen table, the early morning light spilling over her counter as she absentmindedly stirred her coffee. It had been ten long weeks since Agatha had left to start filming. Three weeks since she visited, so three weeks of solitary mornings, awkward nights alone, and an aching emptiness that she couldn’t shake. The reality of Agatha’s absence had hit harder than Rio expected. She’d known the job would take Agatha away for long stretches, but now that the days without her were piling up, it was much harder to deal with than she had thought. Especially after spending a week connecting emotionally and physically in Spain.</p><p>She picked up her phone, scrolling through Agatha's Snapchat stories for the hundredth time that day.</p><p>It was a strange kind of comfort to see Agatha’s smiling face, to feel connected to her even from miles away. Today, Agatha was wrapping up filming in Spain before heading off to Japan. Rio smiled as she watched Agatha in her stories, a few behind-the-scenes glimpses of a quiet moment where she was sitting with the crew, sipping coffee and looking effortlessly stunning.</p><p>Rio’s phone vibrated in her hand, and she glanced down to see a new snap chat from Agatha. She eagerly opened it, feeling a flutter of excitement in her chest.</p><p>Agatha: Last day in Spain! Gonna miss this place... but I can’t wait to get to Japan. It’s all going so fast, and I feel like I haven’t seen you in forever even though its only been three weeks. Miss you, sweetheart ❤️</p><p>Rio’s heart did a little flip at the words. She quickly typed back a response, not wanting to keep Agatha waiting.</p><p>Rio: I miss you so much, I don’t even know how to deal with it. Everything here feels so empty without you. Hope you enjoy Japan, but please, come back soon</p><p>She hit send and immediately felt a wave of longing. Ten weeks had felt like a lifetime, and even though they kept in touch through their personal snaps, facetime and calls, it wasn’t the same as having Agatha there with her.</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but feel a little disconnected sometimes, watching Agatha’s glamorous life through her stories, feeling like an outsider in this whirlwind world. Agatha’s snap had been lighthearted, but Rio could sense the underlying exhaustion in her words. Agatha was working non-stop, traveling across the globe, always under pressure, but she made the effort to check in every night, even when the time difference between them was a challenge.</p><p>As she scrolled through her Snapchat feed, Rio saw more behind-the-scenes snaps of Agatha in Spain. There was one of her walking with her arm around the director, another of her on set, laughing with the crew. Agatha looked so radiant, her usual confidence shining through despite the exhaustion in her eyes. But Rio knew the reality—Agatha missed her too, even if she didn’t say it every time.</p><p>Agatha: I think it's going to be my last stop for a while before I head back to the states. Counting the days until I see you again</p><p>Rio’s heart swelled. The thought of Agatha returning to the States was a beacon of light in the fog of missing her. The idea of having her close again, the anticipation of feeling her arms around her, made Rio's chest ache with longing. It felt like Agatha had been a thousand miles away for far too long, and even though they stayed in contact, it just wasn’t the same.</p><p>She quickly typed out a message to Agatha, wanting her to know how much she meant to her.</p><p>Rio: You’re everything to me, you know that? I can’t wait for you to come home. It’s so hard without you here. But I’m proud of everything you’re doing. Can’t wait to hear all about Japan when you get there ❤️</p><p>Before hitting send, she added a little emoji of a heart, something small to show Agatha how deeply she felt.</p><p>Rio paused for a moment, staring at her phone. She missed Agatha’s voice, the little inside jokes they shared, the way Agatha always made her feel seen. It wasn’t just the physical presence that was missing—it was the way Agatha made her life feel whole.</p><p>The thought of spending more time apart was overwhelming, but Rio was determined to be strong, to support Agatha in her career. That’s what love was, after all—sacrifice, patience, and belief in each other’s dreams.</p><p>As she sent the message, she felt the familiar twinge of excitement when Agatha replied almost immediately.</p><p>Agatha: Japan’s going to be crazy, but I’ll be thinking of you the whole time. I’ll text you tonight when I land. Promise. Miss you more than you know</p><p>Rio could practically hear Agatha’s voice in her head, and the tenderness in her words made her stomach flip. It was crazy how much she could miss someone, even when they were so far away. They’d only been together a few months, but Rio felt like she’d known Agatha forever.</p><p>A wave of nostalgia and longing washed over her, and she leaned back in her chair, closing her eyes for a moment, imagining what it would be like when they could finally be together again, without the interruptions of travel and work. The thought was enough to give her the strength to keep going through her day, even if it felt like a huge chunk of her heart was on the other side of the world.</p><p>Later that day, as Rio was cleaning up her shop, she found herself scrolling through more of Agatha’s stories. She watched as Agatha walked along the cobblestone streets of Seville, a beautiful red dress fluttering in the breeze. Then there was a snap of her on set with the director, a warm smile playing on her lips. She looked like she was thriving. But Rio could tell there was a certain weariness in her eyes, a weariness that came from being apart from someone she loved.</p><p>Rio sighed softly, her fingers lingering on the screen as she stared at Agatha. She missed her so much.</p><p>The phone buzzed in her hand again, and Rio saw Agatha’s name pop up on her screen.</p><p>Agatha: Just landed in Japan. I’m going to miss Spain, but I’m so ready for this next chapter. You’re on my mind the whole time, Rio. Let’s do something special when I get back. I’ll make sure we have all the time we need</p><p>Rio felt a warmth spread through her chest. Her heart swelled as she read the message. It was clear Agatha was as eager to be with her as she was to see her again. And with that, Rio made a silent promise to herself that she’d wait—wait for Agatha, for their future together, no matter how long the distance stretched between them. She was ready for the next chapter, and she would be there, waiting for Agatha’s return, every step of the way.</p><p>Rio had spent the next month counting the days, each one feeling like it dragged on a little longer than the last. The moment Agatha landed back in the States was a huge relief for her.</p><p>It had been over a month since they were in the same time zone, let alone in the same room. Rio could hardly believe it. She’d been waiting for this moment, but now that it was here, her emotions were overwhelming.</p><p>She was standing in Agathas living room, fiddling with the hem of her sweater, pacing back and forth with excitement. She’d missed Agatha so much, it felt like the very air around her was electric with anticipation.</p><p>But it wasn’t just Agatha she’d missed. The days without Remi and Señor Scratchy had felt long, too. It had been quiet without the sound of Remi’s excited barking or the comfort of Scratchy’s quiet presence. She’d grown used to them in a way that surprised her.</p><p>A car door slammed shut. Rio’s heart skipped a beat, her nerves turning into pure excitement. She opened the door and there stood Agatha, with her signature smile, looking effortlessly beautiful.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha said, a playful twinkle in her eye. “I’ve been dying to see you.”</p><p>Rio felt her heart race, her stomach flipping in a way that made her feel like she was fifteen again, having her first crush. She didn’t even think twice. She stepped forward, her arms opening wide, and Agatha didn’t hesitate. Before Rio could even say a word, Agatha was there, her arms wrapping around her waist, pulling her in so tightly that Rio could feel her warmth all over.</p><p>“Oh my god, I missed you so much,” Agatha said, her voice muffled against Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>Rio couldn’t help herself. She jumped, wrapping her legs around Agatha’s waist and holding onto her like she never wanted to let go. Agatha let out a small laugh, adjusting to hold Rio even closer. It felt so natural, like they had never been apart. Rio felt like she could stay like this forever, basking in the feeling of having Agatha in her arms again.</p><p>“I missed you too,” Rio said, her voice thick with emotion. “More than you’ll ever know.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, her hands gently stroking Rio’s back. “I swear, I was counting down the days until I could see you again. You’re everything to me, I love you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to look at Agatha’s face, her eyes scanning her features, noting how Agatha’s face had softened, how her hair was slightly longer, and the little laugh lines around her eyes that appeared when she smiled. It was like she had never left. She was the same Agatha—the same woman Rio had fallen for.</p><p>And yet, there was something even more special about seeing her right here, right now.</p><p>“I love you too. I’ve missed everything about you,” Rio said softly, before leaning in and kissing Agatha gently.</p><p>The kiss was slow at first, just a soft brushing of lips, but it quickly deepened as Agatha’s hands cupped Rio’s face. The familiar taste of Agatha, the feeling of her lips, it was all too much for Rio. She wanted to stay lost in this moment, but the reality of the time apart still hung in the air, making her want to savor every second.</p><p>Agatha pulled back first, breathless. “I have a surprise for you.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, curious. “A surprise?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, her eyes gleaming. “You’ll see.”</p><p>Agatha gently set Rio down and then grabbed her hand, leading her into the living room before going back outside. She returned withRemi, jumping up and down excitedly, tail wagging, and Señor Scratchy, perched on the arm of the couch with that familiar, lazy look. Both were so excited to see her, as if they, too, knew they were finally home.</p><p>Rio's heart melted. “Remi! Señor Scratchy!” she exclaimed, crouching down to give them both love.</p><p>Remi practically leaped into her arms, and Rio couldn’t help but laugh at the excitement. “I missed you two too,” she whispered, scratching behind Remi’s ears and giving Scratchy a soft pet on his head.</p><p>Agatha stood back, watching the scene unfold, a soft smile on her face. “We’ve missed you so much.”</p><p>“I love you,” Rio said, looking up at Agatha with an expression that was full of awe and warmth.</p><p>Agatha walked up to her, gently cupping her face in her hands. “I love you too, Rio. More than anything.”</p><p>The moment felt so right. The long distance, the days spent apart—it was all worth it for this. The way Rio felt in Agatha’s arms, the way everything seemed to fall back into place with the simple act of holding hands, being together, it was like no time had passed at all.</p><p>Remi barked excitedly, breaking the spell of the moment, and Rio couldn’t help but laugh. She gave the dog another quick kiss on the head, then stood and turned to Agatha. “You’re finally here,” she said softly.</p><p>“I’m here,” Agatha replied with a grin, leaning in to kiss Rio once more. This time, the kiss was full of the heat that had built over the past weeks—the kind of kiss that made the world fall away. For those few seconds, it was just the two of them, no distance, no time zones, just the pure connection they shared.</p><p>“I’m so happy you’re back,” Rio whispered when they broke apart. “I’ve missed you so much.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, her eyes softening with affection. “I’m not going anywhere anytime soon, I promise.”</p><p>Rio leaned her forehead against Agatha’s, her heart full of love and relief. “Good,” she whispered. “I don’t think I could stand being apart from you any longer.”</p><p>“I’ll never make you go through that again,” Agatha said with a playful grin, her fingers brushing through Rio’s hair.</p><p>The world outside might be busy and loud, but in that moment, as they stood together in the comfort of their shared space, Rio felt like she had everything she could ever need.</p>

<p>The next morning, after an intimate breakfast in bed with cups of fresh coffee, Agatha told Rio that she had arranged a lunch with her mother, Lilia, who was eager to see her. Rio, still somewhat nervous from the whirlwind of emotions the past few weeks had caused, smiled but couldn’t shake the butterflies in her stomach.</p><p>They arrived at Lilia’s house, a cozy, whimsical home with sprawling gardens, lots of mismatched furniture, and trinkets that told stories. As soon as they stepped inside, Rio was met with the scent of lavender and citrus, and before she could even catch her breath, Lilia appeared in the doorway.</p><p>The second she saw Rio, she embraced her like an old friend, as though the two had known each other for years rather than the singular impromptu meeting over midnight margaritas.</p><p>“Oh darling, it’s so wonderful to see you again!” Lilia exclaimed, pulling back and holding Rio at arm’s length, her eyes scanning her face as if she were searching for something. “Agatha doesn’t stop talking about you, you’re perfect for her.”</p><p>Rio smiled, feeling a little awkward but grateful for Lilia’s openheartedness. Agatha stood by with a playful smirk on her face, clearly amused by the exchange.</p><p>“I’m happy to see you again too, Lilia,” Rio replied, feeling herself relax under Lilia's warm gaze. “I’ve heard so much about you.”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes twinkled. “I’m sure you have, darling. Now, let’s sit down and I’ll tell you all about how I met Agatha when she was just a little thing. You’ll love these stories.”</p><p>The three of them sat down at the dining table, and Lilia immediately launched into her storytelling.</p><p>“Agatha was always a stubborn one,” Lilia began, her voice full of affection as she looked at her daughter. “When she was five, she walked right up to me in the park, grabbed my hand, and declared, ‘You’re going to be my mom.’ I hadn’t even met her before!” Lilia chuckled, her eyes softening as she glanced over at Agatha, who was trying to hide her embarrassment.</p><p>“I didn’t believe in waiting for things to come to me, Mom,” Agatha said, rolling her eyes but clearly amused. “I figured, why not take matters into my own hands?”</p><p>Lilia continued, “I remember thinking, ‘What am I supposed to do with a child?’ But she was so full of life, so sure of herself, that I couldn’t say no. I ended up taking her out for ice cream, and from that day on, we were inseparable.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but smile, completely enchanted by the story. She could see so much of the confident, driven woman that Agatha had become in that little five-year-old, and the bond between them was undeniable.</p><p>“So, you decided to adopt her on the spot?” Rio asked, amazed.</p><p>Lilia nodded. “It was the craziest decision I ever made, and one of the best. She was always meant to be my daughter. I’ve never been able to imagine life without her. And look at her now,” Lilia said with pride, glancing toward Agatha, “still as determined as ever.”</p><p>Agatha groaned in mock annoyance. “I think I might’ve inherited that from you, Mom.”</p><p>Lilia winked. “Well, I do have my own brand of stubbornness. But you, Agatha, you’ve always known exactly what you wanted. Even when you were a little girl.”</p><p>As Lilia continued sharing anecdotes from Agatha’s childhood, Rio felt her heart swell. The more she learned about Agatha’s past, the more she understood the woman she loved. She could see why Agatha was so driven, so independent, and so full of love despite the obstacles she had faced. It was clear that Lilia had played a huge part in shaping Agatha into the person she was.</p><p>At one point, Lilia leaned in toward Rio and lowered her voice. “Agatha doesn’t always show it, but she really cares about you. She’s been a little, how do I say this, emotionally reserved to other people, since I’ve known her, but the way she talks about you? Darling, it’s as though she’s found someone who understands her completely.”</p><p>Rio felt her cheeks flush at the compliment. She looked over at Agatha, who had her head down, a slight blush on her cheeks as she quietly stirred her drink.</p><p>“I feel the same way,” Rio confessed. “I’ve never met anyone like Agatha. She’s just…” Rio trailed off, searching for the right words.</p><p>“Extraordinary?” Lilia finished for her, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Rio smiled, nodding. “Yes. Exactly.”</p><p>Lilia gave a satisfied nod and patted Rio’s hand gently. “Well, I’m glad you two found each other. It’s about time someone could keep up with my daughter’s energy.”</p><p>The rest of the afternoon passed with lighthearted conversation and laughter. Agatha and Rio shared glances that spoke volumes—though they hadn’t said it yet, they both knew they were building something special. As the sun began to set and they prepared to leave, Lilia gave them both a long, tight hug.</p><p>“I’m so glad you came by, Rio. Don’t be a stranger. And take care of my girl, alright?”</p><p>Rio nodded, her heart full. “I will, I promise.”</p><p>As they left Lilia’s house, Agatha took Rio’s hand, her grip tight and comforting. “I’m so glad you’re here with me, Rio,” she said softly.</p><p>“Me too,” Rio replied, leaning in to kiss Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>The open love between them was new, still growing, but Rio knew in that moment that whatever they had would be something lasting. Something worth fighting for.</p><p>The press tour for Agatha's film was in full swing, and the media was buzzing with excitement over her return to the big screen. Everywhere she went, cameras flashed, fans cheered, and reporters eagerly waited to ask her questions about her latest role. But it wasn’t just her acting career that had captured the world’s attention—Agatha’s relationship with Rio was now front and center in the tabloids and social media.</p><p>The couple had been quiet about their relationship, only sharing glimpses of their life together through their private social media accounts to friends and family. The public images were all taken by tabloids.</p><p>Still, fans and journalists alike had taken notice of the way they looked at each other, the obvious affection in their movements, and the playful comments exchanged between them.</p><p>As Agatha sat in a plush studio, preparing for the latest round of interviews, she could feel the nerves crawling up her spine. It had been a whirlwind few weeks, juggling her career, the press tour, and trying to stay connected with Rio, who had been busier with her shop and personal life. The last few weeks had been hard, the distance between them growing as Agatha was swept into the chaos of the tour. But tonight, she was going to be asked about Rio again, there was no question about that. And she was ready for it. Or so she thought.</p><p>The interviewer, a friendly woman in her early thirties, adjusted her microphone and smiled brightly as she introduced the segment. "Agatha, it's wonderful to have you here today. Your new film is already getting rave reviews, and the world is so excited to see you back on screen. But, of course, we can’t ignore the growing interest in your personal life. You've been quite open about your relationship with Rio, and we love seeing how happy you two are together. So, let me ask you this: have you ever thought about the future with Rio? Do you ever see yourself getting married and starting a family one day?"</p><p>The room went silent for a split second, and Agatha’s heart skipped. She wasn’t expecting the question to come up so directly. It was as if the interviewer had read her mind and skipped over the typical questions about her role in the film. The weight of the question hit her like a ton of bricks.</p><p>Agatha’s mind raced. She had never publicly discussed marriage or children, and certainly not in relation to Rio. Sure, she and Rio had spoken about their future, but nothing had been decided. Agatha had always been careful to keep things private, knowing how the public could dissect and twist their every word. But now, with the cameras rolling and the interviewer looking at her expectantly, Agatha could feel the pressure building.</p><p>She cleared her throat, trying to regain her composure. "Well, uh... I mean, Rio and I, we—" She stopped herself, her words trailing off as she realized just how flustered she sounded. It was unusual for Agatha to be caught off guard like this. She was used to being in control of interviews, but this felt personal, and a little too real.</p><p>The interviewer noticed the shift in Agatha’s demeanor and smiled knowingly. "It’s a big question, I know. But people are curious. You’ve been together for over six months now and it’s clear how much you care for each other. So, what does the future look like for you two?"</p><p>Agatha paused, taking a deep breath, her fingers gripping the edge of the armrest of the chair. She didn’t want to misstep or say anything that might sound like a promise she wasn’t ready to make. But she also didn’t want to dismiss Rio, to brush aside the possibility of a future together.</p><p>"I... I think I can say that I’ve never been as happy as I am with Rio," she said, her voice slightly shaking as she spoke. "We’ve had a lot of time to talk about our future, but it’s... it’s something we’re still figuring out together." She gave a nervous laugh, trying to ease the tension in the room. "We’re both kind of... taking it one step at a time."</p><p>The interviewer nodded, still smiling, but Agatha could see the subtle shift in her expression. The room was heavy with expectation. Agatha wanted to say more, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that she had just made things more complicated than they needed to be.</p><p>"Taking it one step at a time," the interviewer repeated, her tone now more inquisitive than sympathetic. "So, no wedding bells or baby plans on the horizon just yet?"</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened, and for a moment, she panicked. "No! No wedding bells, no... no plans for that," she stammered, fumbling for the right words. "I... I love Rio, and we’re happy right now, but we’re not rushing into anything. We’re just enjoying being together, you know?"</p><p>The interviewer gave her a nod of understanding, though Agatha could sense the slight awkwardness hanging in the air. She could feel her cheeks flush, the embarrassment of her uncharacteristic slip-up weighing on her. She wasn’t used to stumbling over her words, especially when it came to her personal life. Agatha was usually so careful, so calculated in everything she did.</p><p>The interviewer smiled, clearly sensing Agatha’s discomfort. "That’s completely understandable, Agatha. It’s so important to let things unfold naturally. But I have to say, you two make such a great couple, and it’s obvious you bring out the best in each other."</p><p>Agatha nodded, relieved that the conversation had taken a less awkward turn. "Thank you," she said, her voice steadier now. "Rio and I... we’re just really happy, and that’s all that matters."</p><p>As the interview continued, Agatha’s thoughts raced. She had tried to be careful, to keep things low-key, but the pressure was starting to get to her. She didn’t want to rush anything with Rio, but she also didn’t want to hide the fact that she was in love with her. Her feelings for Rio were strong, undeniable, but the idea of a future with her—of public expectations and the reality of a relationship being dissected by the world—it was all so overwhelming.</p><p>After the interview ended, Agatha retreated to her dressing room, still feeling flustered. She pulled out her phone, immediately scrolling through her messages until she found Rio’s name. Her fingers hovered over the screen for a moment, and she sighed.</p><p>She couldn’t keep running from the truth. Rio deserved to know what she was thinking, what she was feeling.</p><p>Agatha opened a new message to Rio and typed, her heart racing as she did.</p><p>Agatha: Hey my love, I hope the interview went well. Just wanted to tell you something... I know we’ve talked about taking things slow, but I have to admit, I’m thinking more and more about the future. I love you, and I don’t know what that looks like yet, but I want to explore it with you. Just wanted to be honest with you</p><p>She hit send before she could second-guess herself.</p><p>A few minutes later, Agatha’s phone buzzed. It was a message from Rio.</p><p>Rio: I love you too, Agatha. And whatever the future holds, I’m happy we’re in this together. Take your time, we’ve got all the time in the world</p><p>Agatha smiled, relief washing over her. Rio understood her, more than anyone else ever had.</p><p>Agatha knew they were far from having all the answers, but for the first time, she wasn’t scared of the unknown. She was ready to face whatever came next, as long as Rio was by her side.</p>

<p>The next few months passed in a blur of love, excitement, and a feeling of anticipation that hung in the air like the sweetest of promises. Rio had officially moved in a few weeks after Agathas return from Japan and life had settled into a routine.</p><p>After many deep conversations about the future, they decided to start trying for a baby—something they had both longed for, though neither expected the process to be as emotional and overwhelming as it was. After all, it was one thing to talk about building a family, but it was another to take the first steps toward it.</p><p>They’d spent late nights together, talking about how they imagined their future would unfold. The conversations always turned to their dreams of children, what kind of parents they would be, the values they wanted to instill, and how they would handle the chaos that inevitably came with adding a little one to their family. But beneath all of that, there was an underlying excitement, a feeling of knowing that they were taking a giant leap toward something extraordinary.</p><p>As for Agatha, she was the one who would be carrying their child. It wasn’t a decision they’d made lightly—there had been countless conversations, moments of uncertainty, and late-night talks about what family meant to them. In the end, this path felt right.</p><p>They had chosen to pursue IVF, using DNA derived from Rio’s bone marrow to fertilize Agatha’s eggs. It meant that the baby would truly be theirs—both of them—and that made the journey even more profound.</p><p>Rio felt a deep sense of awe and gratitude. Agatha was offering her body, her strength, to bring their child into the world. And Rio would be right there with her through it all. They weren’t rushing. There was no pressure. They began the process, clinical, but no less sacred. Each appointment, each injection, each hopeful scan became part of something bigger than themselves.</p><p>One night, after a long week of work for both of them, Agatha sat in their living room, gazing out at the sunset. The warmth of Rio’s hand in hers was grounding, comforting. She was aware of every little detail of the moment, the way Rio’s fingers intertwined with hers, how her breath felt slow and steady.</p><p>“You okay?” Rio asked softly, noticing the thoughtful look on Agatha’s face.</p><p>Agatha smiled, leaning back into the couch, her head resting on Rio’s shoulder. “I’m just thinking about everything. About the future. I’m excited, but I also can’t believe we’re really doing this. We’re trying for a baby.” She chuckled lightly, trying to brush off some of the nerves that were bubbling up.</p><p>Rio smiled and squeezed Agatha’s hand. “I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life, Agatha. I’m ready for this. I’m ready for us. And I think we’ll make amazing parents.”</p><p>Agatha could feel the warmth in Rio’s words, the truth behind them. She had no doubt they would make great parents, but that didn’t mean the road ahead was going to be easy. It was full of unknowns, and they both knew that. Yet, Agatha couldn’t deny that the thought of creating a life with Rio—the person who made her feel more alive than she ever had before—was the most exciting thing she could imagine.</p><p>“We’re going to be okay, right?” Agatha asked, her voice quiet, almost hesitant.</p><p>“Of course,” Rio answered immediately, wrapping her arms around Agatha’s shoulders, pulling her in closer. “We’ve already built something so strong together. We’ll be okay, Agatha. You and me, we’ve got this.”</p><p>A sense of calm washed over Agatha, and she closed her eyes, leaning into the warmth of Rio’s embrace. As much as she had doubts, Rio always had a way of making everything feel possible.</p><p>The weeks that followed were full of subtle changes. Agatha started to pay more attention to her body, and Rio was always there to support her—whether it was running errands or simply being by her side when the anxiety about the unknown crept in.</p><p>One afternoon, after Agatha had just finished a work call, she collapsed on the couch, her hand resting gently over her stomach. She was on day 30 of her cycle, and while she had tried to stay calm, the anticipation was beginning to eat away at her. Rio was at the counter, preparing a snack, when Agatha finally spoke.</p><p>“You know, if this doesn’t work right away, I won’t be mad. But I really want it to happen. I’m so ready, Rio,” she admitted, her voice soft but filled with sincerity.</p><p>Rio turned to her, walking over and kneeling down in front of her. “I know you are. And so am I. But remember, we’re in this together. No matter how long it takes. It’s about us, not just about the baby. We’ll get there.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart swelled with affection for Rio. She was so grounded, so calm, and it was just one of the many things Agatha loved about her. They shared a soft kiss, just a gentle press of lips that spoke volumes in its simplicity.</p><p>A few weeks later, Agatha was sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee in her hand when Rio walked in, her face glowing with excitement. “Agatha... I think you should take a test today,” Rio said with a wink, handing her a small box from the pharmacy.</p><p>Agatha looked at her with raised eyebrows, a smile tugging at her lips. “Are you trying to get my hopes up?”</p><p>“I’m just saying... it might be time,” Rio said playfully. “I love you no matter what. But I think this is it.”</p><p>With a deep breath, Agatha stood up, accepting the box from Rio. “I’ll be right back,” she said softly, her pulse quickening.</p><p>As Agatha stepped into the bathroom, her mind raced. She tried to remain calm, but this moment felt so significant, so life-changing. She sat there in silence, waiting, her hands trembling slightly as she read the test result. The world seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the moment when she could walk out of the bathroom and show Rio the news.</p><p>When Agatha stepped back into the living room, Rio was pacing. She looked up, her eyes wide with anticipation.</p><p>“I can’t believe this,” Agatha whispered, her voice thick with emotion as she held out the test.</p><p>Rio looked down at it, her eyes filling with tears when she saw the result.</p><p>“Agatha...” Rio whispered, taking a step forward, her voice shaky. “Is this real?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, nodding, her hand placed gently over her heart. “It’s real, Rio. We’re going to be parents.”</p><p>Tears filled Rio’s eyes as she wrapped her arms around Agatha, pulling her into a tight embrace. “I’m so happy. I love you, Agatha. I love you so much.”</p><p>“I love you too,” Agatha whispered. And in that moment, surrounded by love and anticipation, they knew their world was about to change in the most beautiful way possible.</p><p>The decision to keep the pregnancy a secret from the public was not an easy one for Agatha and Rio, but it felt like the right choice. Their lives were always in the spotlight, but this was something that was just for them—something deeply personal that they wanted to protect for as long as possible.</p><p>Agatha’s work was demanding, with her film commitments still taking priority, but she made a point to be home with Rio in the evenings. They shared quiet dinners with Remi and Senor Scratchy and built a cocoon of privacy comfort in their home.</p><p>It was a Sunday morning when Agatha finally decided to tell Bucky and her mother.</p><p>She had been keeping it a secret for weeks, and while she was excited to share the news, she was also nervous about how they would react.</p><p>Lilia was over for Sunday brunch, and Bucky was there too, lounging on the couch with a beer in his hand, looking like he had just rolled out of bed. Rio was busy in the kitchen, arranging a plate of pancakes, but she kept glancing over at Agatha, who was visibly nervous.</p><p>“So,” Agatha began, sitting at the kitchen table, her hands fidgeting slightly. “I have something I need to tell you both. It’s... important.”</p><p>Lilia looked up from her coffee mug, her eyebrows raised in interest. “What is it, sweetheart? You look like you’re about to confess you’ve decided to run away and join the circus.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, shaking her head. “Mom!. Actually... I’m pregnant,” she said, her voice suddenly full of emotion.</p><p>Bucky, who had been scrolling through his phone, looked up with wide eyes. His jaw dropped, and he immediately shot up from the couch, crossing the room in two large strides. “Wait. What?” he asked, eyes flicking between Agatha and Rio, who had just stepped into the room.</p><p>“Wait, what?” Rio echoed, her face flushed in surprise. She hadn’t expected Agatha to say it quite like that—out of the blue and with such a casual nonchalance. But seeing the stunned expressions on everyone’s faces, she realized that Agatha had been holding this in for quite some time.</p><p>“You’re pregnant?” Bucky asked, his voice filled with disbelief, before it was quickly replaced with a grin. “Holy shit, Agatha, I didn’t see that one coming.”</p><p>Lilia blinked a few times, taking a moment to process what Agatha had said. Then, she put down her coffee mug and stood up, her face lighting up with joy. “Oh, my baby,” she said, rushing over to Agatha and pulling her into a tight hug. “I’m so happy for you. So happy! This is wonderful news!”</p><p>Agatha’s nervousness melted away as she wrapped her arms around her mother. She had known that Lilia would be thrilled, but hearing her mother’s joy made it feel even more real.</p><p>Bucky’s face softened as he walked over to Agatha, placing a hand on her shoulder. “You’ve got this, you know that, right? You’re going to be an amazing mom. And Rio... well, you’ve already got her.”</p><p>Rio, who had been standing quietly by the counter, smiling at the scene before her, felt her heart swell at Bucky’s words. She wasn’t sure when, exactly, she had shifted from being terrified about being a mother to actually looking forward to it. But in that moment, surrounded by people she loved, she realized that she had everything she needed.</p><p>Lilia beamed at Rio, reaching out to give her a hug as well. “I’m so glad she has you, Rio. And I’m even more thrilled that you two are starting a family together. Agatha’s been through so much in her life, and you... you’re exactly what she needed.”</p><p>Rio hugged her back, feeling the weight of Lilia’s words settle deep inside her. It was a beautiful moment, one that made her feel like this truly was the next step in their journey together.</p><p>“We haven’t told anyone else yet,” Agatha said quietly, her eyes flicking toward Rio. She wasn’t sure why she felt the need to add that detail, but it felt important. “We wanted to keep it private for a while. Just... for us, you know?”</p><p>Bucky nodded thoughtfully. “That makes sense. This is a huge change for both of you. Take your time. Don’t let the press or anyone else rush you into anything.”</p><p>Lilia wrapped her arm around Agatha’s shoulders. “And if they try, I’ll knock some heads together,” she added with a mischievous smile.</p><p>Agatha laughed, feeling a huge weight lift from her chest. For the first time in weeks, she was able to breathe easy, knowing that the people she cared about were just as excited for her as she was for herself.</p><p>Later that evening, Agatha and Rio sat together on the couch, the soft light of the fireplace flickering in the background. They were still processing everything—the excitement, the nerves, the emotions that came with knowing that in just over six months, their lives would change in the most beautiful way.</p><p>Rio leaned her head on Agatha’s shoulder, her hand resting over Agatha’s still-flat stomach. “I’m so glad we’ve got each other. I can’t imagine doing this with anyone else,” she whispered, her voice filled with sincerity.</p><p>Agatha turned her head, kissing the top of Rio’s head. “I feel the same way. We’re in this together, always.”</p><p>“Do you think we’re ready?” Rio asked, her voice soft and uncertain, but filled with hope.</p><p>“I think we’re more than ready,” Agatha replied, squeezing her hand gently. “We’ve got this. Together, we’ve got everything we need.”</p><p>Rio called Alice on a quiet Thursday afternoon to say she had some big news to share, Alice could immediately sense something was different.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Alice asked, her voice crackling with curiosity. “You sound all serious. It’s not the flowers getting weird again, is it?”</p><p>Rio laughed nervously, pacing around the living room. “No, no... nothing like that. It’s just... I’ve got something important to tell you.”</p><p>The nerves in Rio’s voice made Alice feel a small pang of concern. She knew Rio well enough to know when she was holding back something big. “Okay, spill. You’ve got me worried now.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath before she finally spoke, her words tumbling out in a rush. “Agatha’s pregnant. We’re having a baby. Well, she’s pregnant, but... you know what I mean. We’re going to have a baby.”</p><p>For a moment, there was only silence on the other end of the line. Rio’s heart raced as she waited for Alice’s response. Was she shocked? Happy? Confused? Rio had no idea what to expect, but she hoped that, as always, Alice would be happy for her.</p><p>Then Alice burst into laughter.</p><p>“Wait, WHAT?” Alice practically yelled, making Rio wince a little. “You’re—she’s—Agatha’s pregnant? Holy shit, Rio, this is huge! I... I can’t believe it!” Her voice was filled with both disbelief and joy. “Wait, are you serious? Is this for real?”</p><p>“Yes!” Rio replied, laughing nervously. “It’s real. We’re just... keeping it quiet for now. Just, like, for us.”</p><p>Alice was still giggling in the background, clearly processing the news, but she quickly switched gears. “Oh my God. Wait, are you okay? Like... I know you’ve been super quiet lately. I thought something was up with you two. Are you sure you’re ready for this? I mean, it’s huge, Rio.”</p><p>Rio paused, her heart rate increasing as she reflected on the whirlwind of emotions that had been running through her since Agatha told her. “I’m not sure I’m ready, but I think I am,” she admitted, her voice softening. “I’ve never felt more sure of something in my life. And it’s with her. Agatha’s... she’s everything to me.”</p><p>There was a long pause on the line before Alice responded, and when she did, her tone was filled with warmth. “Well, if you’re sure, then I’m sure. I’m so happy for you, Rio. I can’t believe it’s happening, but I’m so excited for you both.”</p><p>“Thank you, Alice,” Rio whispered, the weight of the secret they’d been holding suddenly feeling so much lighter. “You have no idea how much I needed to hear that.”</p><p>Alice, still processing, started asking all the questions. “Wait, so, when did she find out? How far along is she? Is it a boy or a girl? Oh my God, this is so... so much.”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly, the anxiety in her voice easing with Alice’s support. “She’s twelve weeks along, and we’re not telling anyone yet. We wanted to keep it private for a while. As for the rest of it, I don’t even know yet. I just—” Rio stopped herself, realizing she was rambling. “I just wanted you to know. I needed you to know.”</p><p>“Of course you did,” Alice replied, her voice suddenly serious. “I’m always here for you, Rio. Always.”</p><p>The two of them spent the next half hour talking about the whirlwind of emotions Rio had been feeling, how excited she was but also how nervous. Alice asked about Agatha, how she was doing, and whether she was ready for the massive change. Rio assured her that Agatha was already over the moon, but still, the pressure of keeping this a secret was weighing on both of them.</p><p>“Wait, so you’re really keeping it a secret from everyone? Like, no one knows?” Alice asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Rio nodded, even though Alice couldn’t see her. “Her Mom and Bucky know but…Yeah. We want to enjoy this moment ourselves first. But it’s hard. It feels like it’s too big to hide forever.”</p><p>“I get that,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “But when you’re ready, you’ll share it. And I’ll be right here, cheering you on.”</p><p>With that, Rio felt a sense of relief she hadn’t realized she needed. Alice wasn’t just accepting the news—she was fully supportive of it, just as she had always been. And that felt like a weight off her shoulders.</p><p>A week later, Rio found herself with Alice in a coffee shop, the two of them catching up over cups of coffee. Alice was all smiles as she listened to Rio talk about her life with Agatha, how they’d been spending more time together, and how, despite the chaos and excitement, everything felt right.</p><p>“So, tell me everything,” Alice said, leaning forward with a grin. “Do I need to start planning your baby shower?”</p><p>Rio laughed, shaking her head. “It’s way too early for that. We’re just taking it one step at a time. But, I don’t know... It’s kind of surreal. I never thought I’d be here, like, planning a future with Agatha.”</p><p>“Well, it’s real,” Alice said, her tone serious now. “And you’re going to make an amazing mom. I know you will.”</p><p>Rio smiled, feeling a warm rush of gratitude. “Thank you. I really needed to hear that.”</p><p>Alice reached over and squeezed her hand. “Anytime, bestie. Anytime.”</p>

<p>Agatha’s morning sickness had been getting worse over the past few days, despite her being in the second trimester. It had started out as a light queasiness that disappeared by midmorning, something she could push through with dry toast and peppermint tea. But now, the nausea clung to her like a second skin. She’d wake up with a dull, throbbing headache and that unmistakable tightness in her stomach. The kind of sick that made her flinch at the smell of her favorite lotion, that turned the thought of breakfast into a cruel joke.</p><p>Rio was always the first to notice.</p><p>“You barely slept,” she murmured one morning, brushing a damp curl from Agatha’s face as she lay curled on the couch, a blanket tucked up to her chin.</p><p>Agatha didn’t argue. Her eyes fluttered open slowly, the light through the curtains making her wince. “I’m fine,” she mumbled, even though she looked anything but with her pale complexion.</p><p>Rio crouched beside her, resting a hand on her arm. “You don’t have to pretend with me.”</p><p>“I’m not,” Agatha replied, but the words sounded thin.</p><p>Rio kissed her forehead and stayed close, her fingers gently combing through Agatha’s hair. She never pushed, never lectured. Just stayed. And Agatha adored her for that.</p><p>Later that afternoon, Agatha posted a short, silent video to her Snapchat story—just a quick clip of Rio pouring her tea in the kitchen, sleeves pushed up, hair tied in a messy bun.</p><p> </p><p>Caption: My girl. I’m obsessed with her ❤️</p><p>She didn’t show the nausea, or the way her hands trembled sometimes, or how she’d had to sit on the bathroom floor for twenty minutes that morning. That part wasn’t for anyone else. No one but their closest family knew.</p><p>Still, she documented the good—the little joys. Like Rio snuggled under a blanket with three different types of snacks. Or the playlist she made for lazy Sundays that included everything from acoustic love songs to old R&amp;B jams.</p><p>“Do you know how hot you are when you’re snacking and being cute and not even trying?” Agatha teased one night, panning the camera slowly across Rio’s concentrated face as she tried to open a stubborn jar of Nutella. No makeup, just sweatpants and sincerity.</p><p>Rio looked up, smirking. “You’re just saying that because I bring you toast at 3 a.m.”</p><p>“Okay, maybe that too.”</p><p>But behind all the private jokes and late-night videos, things weren’t always easy. Some evenings, the sickness was unbearable.</p><p>One night, after Agatha had barely touched her dinner and spent the better part of an hour lying on the bathroom floor, Rio made her a mug of ginger tea with honey and sat beside her on the couch.</p><p>“You don’t have to be strong all the time,” she whispered, tucking a fresh blanket around her.</p><p>Agatha leaned into her touch. “I just… I don’t want you to worry.”</p><p>Rio looked at her, brows drawn together. “Too late for that. I’m already completely gone for you.”</p><p>Agatha gave a soft, tired smile. “I know. And I love you for it.”</p><p>Rio slid her hand over Agatha’s stomach, fingers feather-light over the faintest curve that only she seemed to notice. “We’re doing this together, remember? You’re not alone.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said again, her voice quieter this time, like the reassurance was sinking in deeper. “I’m just tired and feel like shit.”</p><p>Rio leaned down and pressed a kiss just beneath her ribs. “I know Mi Amor. But we’ve got this.”</p><p>That night, they curled into bed like puzzle pieces—Agatha’s back pressed to Rio’s front, Rio’s hand resting over her stomach. She whispered softly like she did every night, a ritual now, a quiet promise only the three of them heard.</p><p>“You’re strong, baby. So strong. And I love you so much. Both of you.”</p><p>Agatha, eyes half-closed, let out a soft hum of contentment. “You’re such a sap,” she whispered.</p><p>Rio grinned against her shoulder. “Only for you.”</p><p>The next day, Agatha posted another story—just Rio’s hand clasped around hers on a blanket-covered knee, the morning sun lighting up their living room.</p><p>Caption: Peace looks like this</p><p>Then, a few minutes later, a clip of Remi chasing a Senor Scratchy through the hallway, Rio’s laugh echoing in the background.</p><p>Caption: Chaos also looks like this</p><p>No mention of the nausea, or the nights spent half-sleeping in the bathroom, or the faint, constant headache. Just love. Just Rio, Remi and Scratchy. Just the quiet life they were building piece by piece.</p><p>Sometimes, when the world outside felt too loud—paparazzi lurking in cars down the street, whispers online that speculated about everything from her wardrobe to her weight—Agatha would slip her phone into her pocket and curl up next to Rio on the couch.</p><p>Rio would wrap her up in a blanket, press a kiss to the crown of her head, and murmur, “Let them talk. This—” she’d gesture to the room, the tea, Remi snoring in the corner, “—this is real.”</p><p>And it was. It was theirs.</p><p>Their life, their love, their little world full of messy rooms and inside jokes and soft, reverent touches. A world where Rio whispered to Agatha’s stomach like it was a only them, where love spilled over in little ways—through forehead kisses, mismatched mugs of tea, the way Rio’s fingers always found Agatha’s without having to look.</p><p>Every night, as the world hummed outside their windows and the day settled into silence, Rio would hold her close and whisper:</p><p>“I love you. I’m so proud of you. And I can’t wait to meet the piece of us we’re growing.”</p><p>And Agatha, resting her head against Rio’s chest, would close her eyes and smile—tired, yes, but never alone.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>At five months pregnant, Agatha’s belly had begun to show in a way that was no longer easy to hide, but she still found ways to keep it under wraps. Her wardrobe had evolved; she was expertly selecting outfits that draped over her stomach in flattering ways, opting for loose, flowy tops, oversized blazers, and dark, high-waisted pants. Despite her growing bump, she was determined to keep the pregnancy a secret from the public for as long as possible. She hadn’t shared the news with only a select few close friends and family members actually being aware.</p><p>Agatha had hired a new PR manager, Jen Kale, to help manage the situation and ensure that the media didn't catch wind of the pregnancy. Jen was an expert in keeping things under wraps and managing high-profile celebrities, and Agatha felt confident that she would be able to protect their secret. Jen worked tirelessly behind the scenes, keeping Agatha's public appearances under tight control and ensuring that her social media presence was strategically curated. It wasn’t long before Agatha’s entire public image was being carefully controlled to avoid any leaks.</p><p>Jen was a no-nonsense woman in her mid-thirties, tall, with a shaved head and sharp features. She always appeared calm, collected, and prepared for anything. Agatha trusted her completely, and their working relationship was off to a good start.</p><p>“Keep a low profile,” Jen would advise, reminding Agatha to stay out of the public eye as much as possible. “We’ll manage the press with calculated posts, but you need to lay low on any big public events for now.”</p><p>Agatha took Jen’s advice to heart, limiting her outings to only the most necessary events—private dinners with industry colleagues, a few charity galas where her appearance was a must—but all of it was calculated. Rio was fully on board of keeping the pregnancy under wraps. She didn’t want the media breathing down their necks any more than they already had.</p><p>It wasn’t just about the public eye anymore; it was about what felt right for them. They both felt a deep need for privacy during this special time, a time to focus solely on each other, on their relationship, and on the new life they were creating together. They didn’t need the noise of the world interrupting that.</p><p>Despite the secrecy, it wasn’t easy. Agatha would sometimes get so tired of hiding the pregnancy and wished she could shout from the rooftops about how excited she was. She wanted to walk down the street with Rio and let people see how much she was growing and changing. But she knew that would have to wait.</p><p>Agatha would often spend time alone with Rio at home, where she could freely touch her belly and speak openly about the pregnancy. They’d laugh together about the baby’s unpredictable growth spurts or the foods Agatha suddenly craved—she had become obsessed with pickles and cheese, which Rio thought was the strangest combination but still lovingly brought them to her when Agatha asked.</p><p>It was on one of these quiet evenings, when they were alone at home, that Agatha finally decided to tell Rio what she had been holding in for weeks. She had been struggling with the secrecy, and it weighed heavily on her heart.</p><p>“I feel like I’m lying to the world, you know?” Agatha said, looking over at Rio as they sat on the couch, the evening light casting a warm glow in the living room. “I love our life together, and I love this baby so much… But it’s like I have to keep this part of me hidden, and it’s not easy.”</p><p>Rio looked over at Agatha, her expression filled with understanding. “I know, my love. But I think we’re doing the right thing, for us. We don’t need the world’s approval. It’s just about us, right now.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, letting out a sigh of relief. “Yeah… you’re right. I just wish I could shout it from the rooftops and let everyone know how happy I am. I love you, Rio, and I love this little one.”</p><p>Rio smiled softly, leaning over to rest her head on Agatha’s shoulder. “One day, we’ll tell them. But for now, I think we’re doing what’s best for us. We’ve got our little bubble of love, and nothing else matters.”</p><p>Agatha kissed the top of her head, her hand gently resting on her belly. “I just can’t wait for our family to grow,” she said softly, the love in her voice unmistakable.</p><p>Rio wrapped her arm around Agatha’s waist, hugging her close. “Me neither.”</p><p>Despite the secrecy, their bond had never been stronger. Every day, they grew closer to each other and to the baby, and though the world would have to wait to find out about their little miracle, Agatha and Rio knew they had something truly special.</p><p>A week later, as Agatha was getting ready for a private dinner event with Jen and a few key industry contacts, Rio was by her side, helping her pick out the perfect outfit. Agatha stood in front of the mirror, adjusting the hem of her navy-blue, tailored dress, which cleverly concealed the curve of her belly. Her bump was getting harder to hide, but Agatha was determined to make it work.</p><p>“How do I look?” she asked, turning to Rio with a playful smile.</p><p>“You look gorgeous as always,” Rio replied, her eyes sparkling with affection as she looked at Agatha, “But I can tell you’re tired. Don’t push yourself too hard.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly, nodding. “I know, I know. But I’ve got to keep up appearances.”</p><p>“I get it,” Rio said, her tone warm and understanding. She reached out, gently resting her hand on Agatha’s stomach, feeling the slightest flutter of the baby’s movements. “But don’t forget to take care of yourself. You’re the most important thing to me. You’re both my world.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened, and she placed her hand over Rio’s. “I’m lucky to have you,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion.</p><p>Rio smiled up at her. “We’re both lucky.”</p><p>The secret was still being kept, they would continue to hold it close—just the two of them, and the little life growing between them.</p><p>The weeks passed by quickly, Agatha and Rio settled into a new rhythm of life, more in love than ever. Rio’s work with her florist business had calmed down for the time being, giving her more time to spend with Agatha. Despite the inevitable pressures of being in the public eye, they found moments of peace and happiness together in the quiet of Agatha’s home.</p><p>One evening, after a long, tiring day, Agatha and Rio were curled up on the couch together, watching a movie. Agatha’s head rested on Rio’s chest, as usual, her hand gently placed on her growing belly. Remi and scratchy snuggled together in front of them. The soft rhythm of Agatha’s breath and the quiet sound of the movie playing in the background made the world outside feel so distant.</p><p>Rio looked down at Agatha, her mind racing with thoughts she had been carrying for a while now. The thought of spending her life with Agatha felt like the most natural thing in the world. Everything had changed between them, and every day she spent with Agatha only solidified that she never wanted this to end.</p><p>Agatha, sensing the quiet tension in the air, lifted her head slightly and looked up at Rio, her eyes searching her face. “What’s on your mind, my love?” Agatha asked, her voice gentle.</p><p>Rio paused for a moment, heart racing. “I’ve been thinking a lot,” she began, her voice softer than usual. “About us… about the future.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows furrowed slightly, concern creeping into her expression. “What about the future?”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, trying to calm the nervous energy bubbling inside her. “I don’t want to wait anymore. I don’t want to wait for the right moment or for the world to catch up with us. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Agatha. I want us to be a family. You, me, our baby…”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat as she listened intently, not sure where this was going but already feeling her heart swelling with affection.</p><p>“I don’t think I could love you any more than I do right now, Rio,” Agatha said quietly, her voice thick with emotion. “But what… what are you trying to say?”</p><p>Rio swallowed, gathering her courage. “I want you to marry me, Agatha. I want you to be my wife.”</p><p>The words hung in the air between them, the weight of them settling in a soft silence. Agatha blinked, her eyes wide with surprise, and for a moment, Rio thought she might have misheard or misinterpreted the situation. But then Agatha’s lips parted into a smile so wide that it reached her eyes, and Rio’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>“Marry you?” Agatha whispered, her voice cracking slightly with emotion. She sat up, her hand gently resting on Rio’s knee. “You really want that? You want to marry me?”</p><p>Rio nodded, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s. “More than anything. I don’t want to waste any more time. I want us to be tied together in every possible way we can be. I want to stand by you in everything we do.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened, tears threatening to spill as she reached for Rio’s hand, gently holding it in hers. “Rio,” she whispered, her voice full of wonder. “You’re everything to me. You’re everything I’ve ever wanted. I’ve been dreaming about this, about you, about us… and I can’t believe you’re asking me.”</p><p>Rio smiled, her heart pounding with a mix of relief and joy. “So, you’ll marry me?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper, hoping she hadn’t misread the situation.</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly, tears glistening in her eyes as she leaned forward, pressing her forehead against Rio’s. “Yes,” she breathed, a smile tugging at the corner of her lips. “Yes, I’ll marry you, Rio. A million times yes.”</p><p>Rio’s heart swelled as she leaned in, kissing Agatha softly at first, but it quickly deepened into a passionate kiss. The world around them faded away, and all that mattered in that moment was the connection between them, the love they shared, and the future they were about to build together.</p><p>When they pulled apart, Agatha gazed at Rio with a soft, adoring smile. “I love you, Rio,” she whispered, brushing a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear.</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened with affection as she cupped Agatha’s face in her hands. “I’ve known since that first date that I was meant to be with you, Agatha. I just want to make this real.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, her heart full. “It’s real. We’re real, Rio. We’re a family.”</p><p>The two women wrapped their arms around each other, the world outside their home seeming so far away as they held each other close. The love between them was undeniable, and in that quiet, intimate moment, they knew they were exactly where they were meant to be.</p><p>Rio’s heart was full as she whispered, “I love you.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, her voice soft and full of promise. “I love you more than you’ll ever know.”</p>

<p>The night had been peaceful. Rio and Agatha had spent it curled up in bed, talking about everything and nothing, enjoying their final few weeks of peace before their baby arrived. They laughed, joked, and whispered about all the little things they were excited about—Agatha’s unexpected cravings for pickles and peanut butter, the baby’s nursery they’d set up together, and how they’d each imagined the day their son would be born.</p><p>It was late, nearing 1 AM when Rio, her head nestled against Agatha’s chest, heard a sudden, distinct sound—a popping noise, followed by a trickle of water.</p><p>Agatha flinched slightly, her eyes going wide. She sat up slowly, looking down at the bed. “Uh, Rio… my water just broke.”</p><p>Rio's breath caught in her throat. For a moment, she couldn't process what Agatha had just said. She blinked several times, her mind struggling to catch up with the sudden rush of reality. She looked down at Agatha’s now-wet pyjama bottoms, the unmistakable signs of her water breaking.</p><p>“Oh my God,” Rio gasped, her voice panicked. Her heart began to race, and a cold sweat broke out on her brow. “Agatha, are you okay? Are you—are you sure?”</p><p>Agatha took a steadying breath, trying to calm the sudden chaos that had rushed into her. “I’m okay. I think it’s time… but we need to get to the hospital.”</p><p>At the mention of the hospital, Rio’s panic skyrocketed. She jumped out of bed, pacing nervously. “Okay. Okay, let’s go. We can’t just—what about the paparazzi? What if they follow us? We need to keep this quiet.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened with reassurance. “We’re going to be fine, I promise. I’ve got everything ready. We just need to stay calm.”</p><p>But Rio wasn’t calming down. Her thoughts were spiraling, the panic building in her chest. What if the paparazzi got wind of it? What if they were caught on camera when Agatha was in labor? They’d managed to hide that Agatha was expecting, they had worked so hard to keep this part of their lives private.</p><p>Agatha grabbed Rio by the shoulders, stopping her frantic pacing. “Hey, hey,” she said gently. “It’s going to be okay. Let’s call Jen.”</p><p>Jen was a godsend. She’d helped them navigate the labyrinth of media attention, keeping their personal lives as private as possible. But now, with labor imminent and everything moving so quickly, Agatha knew Jen would need to step in.</p><p>Rio nodded, still breathing quickly, and immediately pulled out her phone. “I’ll call her,” Rio said, her voice shaky as she quickly dialed Jen’s number. The phone rang twice before Jen picked up, her groggy voice instantly sharp with attention.</p><p>“Jen, it’s Rio,” Rio said quickly, barely able to get the words out. “Agatha’s water broke. We need to go to the hospital, but we can’t let the press get wind of it. They’ll follow us if they know. We need you to help us.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence before Jen spoke. “I’m on it, Rio. Don’t worry. I’ll arrange everything. I’ll make sure the hospital is kept private, and I’ll make sure no one is alerted. You and Agatha just get to the car, and I’ll handle it from here.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio breathed, her voice full of relief. She hung up, her eyes meeting Agatha’s. “Jen’s got it. She’s gonna make sure we’re not followed.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a small, reassuring smile, though she was starting to feel the first waves of labor contractions. She could tell Rio was overwhelmed, and it broke her heart a little to see her so panicked.</p><p>“We have to get moving,” Agatha said, taking a deep breath. “It’s time.”</p><p>Rio helped Agatha get dressed quickly, her hands trembling as she zipped up Agatha’s jacket. She was still panicking, her mind racing with thoughts of how this would unfold in the middle of the night. But she tried to focus, taking steady breaths to calm herself.</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Rio muttered to herself, running a hand through her messy hair. “You’ve got this. We’ve got this.”</p><p>Agatha, now fully dressed, placed a gentle hand on Rio’s arm. “You’re doing great, my love. You’re going to be a great mom. Let’s just get through this together.”</p><p>They made their way to the garage, where Agatha’s G-Wagon was parked. Rio held the door open for Agatha, her hands shaking as she helped Agatha into the passenger seat. Her thoughts were racing as she jumped into the driver’s seat. She checked her rearview mirror nervously, hoping no one would notice them. Agatha had made sure her PR team had a plan, but still—this felt too real, too quick.</p><p>“Jen said she’s got eyes on the hospital,” Rio murmured, her voice strained. “No one will follow us, but I can’t help but feel like I’m in some kind of movie right now. This feels… surreal.”</p><p>Agatha reached over, touching Rio’s hand gently. “I know. But we’re going to do this, together.”</p><p>They drove in silence for a few moments, the weight of the situation sinking in. Rio was still nervous, but Agatha’s calm presence helped ground her. She reached over and squeezed Agatha’s hand, trying to focus on the road ahead.</p><p>When they arrived at the hospital, everything was already set up. Jen had worked quickly, making sure that no photographers were in sight and that Agatha’s entrance was as discreet as possible. Rio helped Agatha out of the car, and the two of them walked in, Agatha’s arm wrapped tightly around Rio for support.</p><p>Jen was waiting in the hospital lobby, and she gave them a small nod as they entered, signaling that everything had been handled.</p><p>“You’re good,” Jen said quietly. “No one is here. You’re safe.”</p><p>As they made their way to the private maternity suite, Rio finally let out a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding. She was exhausted—physically, mentally, emotionally. But now that they were inside and secure, all that mattered was that Agatha was okay. And soon, their son would be too.</p><p>Agatha gave her a soft smile, her voice calm but laced with a hint of exhaustion. “I’m ready, Rio. Let’s do this.”</p><p>Rio kissed her forehead, her heart swelling with a mixture of love, awe, and nervous excitement. “We’re in this together, Agatha. I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>And as they prepared to bring their child into the world, the world outside felt miles away.</p><p>The hours seemed to drag on, and Rio felt the weight of the situation pressing down on her chest with each passing minute. She could barely process what was happening. Agatha was in so much pain, the contractions coming one after another, and the sound of her labored breaths filled the room. The sterile smell of the hospital seemed to disappear as the two of them entered their own world—one of pain, fear, and the unknown.</p><p>Agatha gripped Rio’s hand tightly, her knuckles white from the force. Her forehead was slick with sweat, and her face was pale. The nurses and doctors moved quickly and efficiently, but to Rio, it felt like everything was happening in slow motion. Every sound, every movement, was amplified in her ears as she watched Agatha fight to keep her composure.</p><p>Lilia was there by her other side, wiping the sweat from Agatha’s forehead with a cool cloth. She spoke to Agatha in soft, calming words, doing everything she could to provide comfort in the chaos of the moment.</p><p>"You're doing so well, sweetheart. Just breathe," Lilia murmured, her voice steady even though Rio could see the worry in her eyes. She looked up at Rio for a moment, and there was a silent exchange between them. Lilia's gaze said everything: Stay strong for her.</p><p>Rio nodded, swallowing hard. Her hands were shaking, but she held on to Agatha’s tightly, trying to stay calm for both of them. Agatha’s eyes flickered to her in between contractions, the vulnerability in them almost too much to bear.</p><p>“I can’t… I don’t know if I can do this, Rio,” Agatha gasped between breaths, her voice strained. The fear in her eyes mirrored Rio’s own.</p><p>“Shh, you’re doing amazing,” Rio whispered, leaning down to press a kiss to Agatha’s forehead, her fingers threading through Agatha’s damp hair. “I’m right here. We’re going to do this. We’ve got this.”</p><p>But as the labor dragged on, Agatha’s condition began to worsen. Her breathing became more erratic, and she started to lose color. Rio’s stomach churned with dread. She could feel her heart racing in her chest, and her thoughts started to spiral into a dark place. Something was wrong.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio asked, her voice trembling with concern. “Agatha, are you okay?”</p><p>But Agatha didn’t respond. Her grip on Rio’s hand weakened, and for a terrifying moment, Rio thought she’d lost her. Her heart lurched in her chest, and panic surged through her veins.</p><p>“Agatha! Look at me!” Rio pleaded, her voice rising with fear. She tried to gently shake Agatha, but the woman’s body had gone limp, her face pale and covered in a sheen of sweat.</p><p>“Doctor!” Rio shouted. She was hyperventilating now, her breathing shallow, struggling to keep it together for Agatha. She looked to the nurse, whose face had gone grim as she quickly moved to Agatha’s side.</p><p>The room exploded into action. Rio felt like she was drowning in the chaos, unable to do anything except watch. Nurses were moving around the bed, checking Agatha’s vitals, and doctors were barking orders, but everything seemed muffled, distant. The walls felt like they were closing in on her.</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio cried, her voice breaking. “Please, don’t leave me. I need you.” Tears blurred her vision, and her body felt like it was shaking uncontrollably. She couldn't lose her. Not like this. Not when they’d come so far.</p><p>Lilia stepped forward, her hand resting on Rio’s shoulder. Her face was taut with concern, but there was something else—something fierce in her eyes. “She’s strong, Rio. Agatha is strong. Just breathe, darling. We’ll get her through this.”</p><p>Rio nodded, doing her best to steady herself. She couldn’t lose it now. She had to be there for Agatha.</p><p>The doctors worked quickly, and after a few agonizing minutes, they stabilized Agatha. She was pale, her eyes closed, but she was alive. The fear slowly ebbed away from Rio as she saw the faint rise and fall of Agatha’s chest. Her pulse was steady once again.</p><p>One of the nurses looked at Rio, her face sympathetic but serious. “She’s lost quite a bit of blood,” the nurse said softly. “We need to monitor her closely, but right now, we need to focus on getting the baby out safely.”</p><p>Rio nodded mutely, tears still falling, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s face. She couldn’t believe how close she had come to losing her. Her hands shook as she held Agatha’s again, her voice barely a whisper as she leaned down to speak into Agatha’s ear.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio said, her heart aching. “I’m right here. You don’t have to do this alone. Please, Agatha, I need you to be strong. For us.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered open briefly, her lips parting as if to say something. A weak, strained smile appeared on her face. “I love you too… so much…” she whispered, the words barely escaping her lips before her eyes closed again.</p><p>Lilia, who had been silently observing the scene with a mix of concern and determination, wiped away her own tears before speaking gently to Rio. “She’s a fighter. Our girl is going to be just fine.”</p><p>Rio looked up at Lilia, swallowing hard. “I can’t… I don’t know what I’d do without her. I can’t lose her.”</p><p>“You won’t,” Lilia said firmly, her voice soft but filled with strength. “You have each other, and that’s all that matters. She’ll be okay.”</p><p>The minutes dragged on, but gradually, the tension in the room began to dissipate. The nurses and doctors were still working tirelessly, but there was a sense of hope. Agatha was going to make it through this.</p><p>Finally, Agatha’s voice cut through the noise of the hospital room. “Rio…” Her voice was weak, but it was there.</p><p>“I’m here, baby,” Rio whispered, her voice breaking. “I’m here, Agatha. I’ll never leave you.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers slowly curled around Rio’s hand again, her touch shaky but reassuring. “We’re going to be okay,” Agatha whispered. “We’re going to be parents… together.”</p><p>And in that moment, Rio knew that no matter how hard this journey was, she would never face it alone. With Agatha by her side, she could get through anything.</p>

<p>The labor stretched on, longer than either of them had expected, but Rio could feel the faint sense of relief creeping in. Agatha’s breathing had finally stabilized, and she was able to focus once more on the final stages of giving birth. It wasn’t over, but the worst of it was behind them. Agatha squeezed Rio’s hand tighter as the pain intensified once again, and Rio leaned closer, her lips close to Agatha’s ear.</p><p>“You’re so strong, Agatha. You’re doing amazing,” Rio whispered, her voice trembling with a mix of admiration and love. “I’m so proud of you.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered open, and she managed a small, weak smile through the exhaustion. Her skin was still pale, but there was a glimmer of determination in her eyes. She was exhausted, but she wasn’t giving up.</p><p>The room was filled with the sounds of the doctors and nurses as they worked to bring their son into the world. Rio stood by Agatha’s side, her heart racing, never leaving her. She rubbed Agatha’s hand, whispering encouraging words, even as her own body trembled with nervous energy.</p><p>“Just a little more, Agatha. You’re doing so well,” one of the doctors encouraged, glancing up at her with a calm, reassuring smile.</p><p>And then, after what felt like an eternity, Agatha gave one final, forceful push. The room was filled with a collective exhale of relief as the baby was finally born. Rio’s breath caught in her throat as she watched the nurses gently take the tiny, wriggling bundle into their hands, and in that moment, she could hardly believe it.</p><p>Their son.</p><p>He let out a loud, indignant cry as the nurses cleaned him off, and Rio’s chest tightened with emotion at the sound. She was overwhelmed—by the sheer beauty of the moment, by how much her heart had expanded in a single instant. She was a mother now, in the most profound way, and their family was finally complete.</p><p>Agatha, though still weak from the labor, managed to turn her head toward Rio, her voice strained but full of love and awe. “Rio… he’s here. Our son.”</p><p>Rio blinked away tears as she looked at Agatha, her heart swelling with pride and love for the woman beside her. “We did it. We really did it,” she whispered, her voice catching in her throat.</p><p>The baby was quickly wrapped in a soft, light blanket, and one of the nurses gently brought him over to Agatha’s chest, where she could finally hold him. Agatha’s hands trembled as she cradled their son for the first time, her eyes brimming with tears as she gazed down at him.</p><p>“I can’t believe it,” Agatha said softly, her voice trembling. “He’s perfect.”</p><p>Rio watched her, completely captivated by the scene before her. Agatha, who had been so strong and determined throughout the labor, was now completely undone in the best possible way. Her tears fell freely, mixing with her smile as she looked at their baby.</p><p>“He is perfect,” Rio agreed, her voice barely more than a whisper as she gazed at their son for the first time. “I love you so much, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes found Rio’s, and there was something so raw and pure in her gaze, something that spoke volumes about everything they’d been through to get here. Agatha pulled Rio closer, one arm still wrapped around their son, as if holding on to both of them at once. “I love you, too. I can’t wait for you to hold him.”</p><p>The doctor spoke again, and it took Rio a moment to realize that it was time for the next step.</p><p>“Okay, Rio,” the doctor said gently, “If you’re ready, it’s time to cut the cord.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught in her throat, but there was no hesitation in her movements. She nodded, swallowing hard as she stepped forward. Agatha’s hand was still gripping hers, tight and reassuring.</p><p>With a sharp, but gentle snip, Rio cut the cord, her heart swelling with emotion as she realized just how monumental this moment was. Their son, now a part of their family forever. Rio had never felt such a sense of connection, of purpose.</p><p>The doctor handed their son back to the nurses, who began to weigh him and measure him, making sure he was healthy. Rio, though still overwhelmed by the events of the past few hours, couldn’t take her eyes off him. He was tiny—so small, yet so perfect.</p><p>As the nurses finished with the baby, they handed him back to Agatha, and she carefully placed him into Rio’s arms. It felt surreal to finally hold their child. Rio looked down at the little bundle in her arms, the tiny hands and feet, the soft, delicate face. She leaned down to kiss his forehead gently, her heart expanding with love for the little person she and Agatha had created together.</p><p>“Hi, little one,” Rio whispered, her voice full of awe and emotion. “I’m your mami, and I love you so much.”</p><p>Agatha reached over, resting her hand gently on Rio’s shoulder. “We did it,” she whispered, her voice full of wonder and tenderness. “We’re parents now.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her voice thick with emotion. “We’re a family.” She looked up at Agatha, tears still in her eyes. “You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, Agatha. I’ll never take that for granted.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, her eyes shining with tears as well. “And you, Rio. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, too.”</p><p>In that moment, surrounded by their son, their hearts full of love and hope for the future, they both knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, they would face them together. They had created something beautiful—something that was theirs—and they would cherish it with everything they had.</p><p>The following days after the birth were a blur of joy and emotion. The world had shifted in the most profound way, and Agatha and Rio couldn’t wait to share the news with their closest family and friends. They decided to announce their son's birth through a series of Snapchat stories.</p><p>She snapped a picture of their son’s tiny hand wrapped around her finger, a delicate contrast against her own long, manicured fingers. The image was simple, but it said everything.</p><p>"Meet our son," Agatha wrote over the picture, her words a soft declaration of the love they’d created. "We’re so in love."</p><p>Rio, standing beside Agatha, couldn’t stop staring at their son. She kissed his forehead gently before pulling out her own phone, capturing a moment of Agatha holding him and looking down at him with all the tenderness in the world.</p><p>"Can’t believe I’m a mom," Rio added, her voice trembling with happiness. "This little guy is already everything to me."</p><p>She tagged Agatha’s private friends list and included close family members, making sure that the people who mattered most could see the birth announcement. The story was a quiet, intimate affair, but it spoke volumes. They weren’t interested in the flash of public attention—they just wanted to share their joy with the people they loved.</p><p>Later that day, Lilia came over to the house, her arms open wide as she approached Rio and Agatha in the living room. She had a radiant smile on her face, already looking like she’d come prepared to spoil her new grandson.</p><p>“He’s perfect. Absolutely perfect.”</p><p>Agatha, holding their baby in her arms, smiled as Lilia gently took the little one from her. "You’re already spoiling him, aren’t you, Mom?"</p><p>Lilia gave a playful shrug. "Spoiling? Oh, darling, I’m just giving him the love he deserves!" She kissed the baby’s head, her eyes filled with a tender warmth. "I’m going to spoil him with love, and if I happen to sneak him a cookie or two before he’s old enough to know better, well… that’s between me and him."</p><p>Agatha chuckled, her heart swelling with affection as she watched her mother fawn over their son. "I can already tell he’s going to have you wrapped around his little finger."</p><p>Lilia shot Agatha a wink. "Of course, dear. But he’s going to be so loved, and that’s what matters."</p><p>The day continued with laughter and warmth, and soon, Bucky and Alice arrived, both eager to meet the newest member of their family. The moment Alice stepped inside, she went straight to Rio, pulling her into a tight hug. “I’m so happy for you,” Alice whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “You’re going to be the most amazing mom. I know it.”</p><p>Bucky, ever the jokester, wiped away a fake tear and gave Rio a quick but heartfelt hug. “You’re doing a great job, Rio. Agatha may have been carrying the little guy, but you’ve been by her side the whole time. You’re a team. I can already tell you’re gonna be the coolest mom.”</p><p>Rio laughed, wiping away her own tears as she held the baby in her arms. “You both are too sweet,” she said, her voice thick with emotion. “I’m just… in awe of everything. He’s perfect.”</p><p>Bucky nodded, his eyes softening. “He really is. And you two,” he gestured between Agatha and Rio, “You’re perfect together. Look at you. You’re parents now.”</p><p>Agatha beamed, looking over at Rio with so much love that it was almost palpable. “I couldn’t have asked for a better partner in this. I love you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio leaned in, brushing her lips against Agatha’s in a soft kiss. “I love you too. So much.”</p><p>The room was quiet for a moment as everyone admired the baby. Then, Alice broke the silence with a soft, emotional chuckle. “I’m not crying, you are,” she said, wiping at her eyes. “He’s just so beautiful. It’s all so perfect.”</p><p>Lilia, sitting on the couch with the baby cradled in her arms, agreed with a contented sigh. “I’m so glad we’re here to witness this. Our family is growing, and it’s so full of love.”</p><p>As the afternoon went on, the group spent time together, laughing, sharing stories, and marveling at how much the world had changed in such a short period of time. It was clear that this little boy had already brought an abundance of love and happiness into their lives, and the future looked bright.</p><p>Later that night, after everyone had gone home, Rio sat on the couch beside Agatha, their baby sleeping peacefully in the bassinet beside them. Rio rested her head on Agatha’s shoulder, feeling the warmth of their family bond, and the overwhelming sense of love that had settled in their home.</p><p>“This is everything,” Rio whispered, her voice barely audible. “I never imagined life could be this full.”</p><p>Agatha wrapped her arm around Rio, pulling her closer. “Me neither. But I wouldn’t want to experience it with anyone else.”</p><p>They both gazed at their son, the love and admiration in their eyes so palpable it seemed to fill the entire room.</p><p>“This is just the beginning,” Agatha said softly, her voice full of certainty. “Our little family is just getting started, and I know it’s going to be amazing.”</p><p>Rio smiled, the weight of the moment sinking in. She felt so incredibly lucky, so deeply loved, and her heart swelled as she whispered, “I can’t wait for the rest of our lives.”</p>

<p>The press had been buzzing with speculation, their headlines increasingly louder and more desperate. ‘Agatha and Rio: Are They Still Together?’ one tabloid headline screamed. ‘Fans Wonder Why Agatha Hasn't Been Seen in Public Recently – Has She and Rio Split?’ another asked.</p><p>It was all nonsense, of course. But the press couldn’t seem to get enough of it. They took Agatha’s recent disappearance from the public eye as a signal that something was wrong between her and Rio. They noticed the absence of their usual public outings, the lack of pictures captured over the lat few months.</p><p>Some suggested Agatha was hiding away because of a breakup. Others, more dramatically, claimed that she was depressed or maybe even retreating into seclusion because of an undisclosed personal crisis. It was all a little ridiculous—and completely off the mark.</p><p>But Agatha and Rio? They were completely in love, stronger than ever, and just enjoying their life together behind closed doors. The reality of their situation was simple: Agatha had given birth to their baby, and they were keeping it private for now. No one—except for their closest friends and family—knew that they had a newborn at home.</p><p>One lazy afternoon, Rio sat with Agatha in their living room, both of them scrolling through the latest tabloid rumors with a mixture of amusement and disbelief. Agatha was resting her head on Rio’s shoulder, her hand gently resting on Rios arm.</p><p>"Omg, Rio," Agatha chuckled, swiping through a particularly dramatic headline. "Look at this one. 'Has Agatha been hiding because she’s heartbroken?' I don’t think I’ve ever felt more in love in my life."</p><p>Rio laughed too, squeezing Agatha’s hand. "I know, right? Who writes this stuff?"</p><p>Agatha smiled, pressing a kiss to Rio's cheek. "Well, we are good at keeping secrets. It’s just, this is a secret I’m happy to keep."</p><p>"You know," Rio said, glancing down at the article again, "there’s nothing like a good breakup rumor to make us look even more in love. Not that they know, of course."</p><p>"Exactly. They think we're falling apart, but we’re just over here, in total bliss with a newborn," Agatha laughed, sitting up a bit. "I can’t even tell you how happy I am right now. We’ve got our baby, we’re together, and we’re just… doing our thing."</p><p>Rio smiled softly, nodding. "Yeah. It’s been a rollercoaster, but I wouldn’t change a thing. Besides, I kind of love the idea of the press thinking we’re falling apart when we’re actually over here having the best time. The whole world’s completely missing the mark."</p><p>Agatha laughed, leaning back into the couch. "I think they’re just upset they don’t get to be a part of this. But I’m happy it’s just ours. Our little secret."</p><p>She reached out, wrapping her arms around Rio’s waist, pulling her closer. "Besides, who cares what they say when I’ve got you, my love?"</p><p>Rio’s heart fluttered as she returned Agatha’s embrace. "I’ve got you too. And I think it’s amazing that we get to have this time for ourselves. No one knows what we’re doing, what we’re building together. It’s just us."</p><p>"Exactly," Agatha said, pressing her lips to Rio’s forehead. "I’m not hiding from anyone. I just want to enjoy this, you know? Nicky, you, everything. All of it."</p><p>Rio nodded. She felt the weight of those words, the love Agatha spoke with. "Yeah," she whispered. "We’re a family now. And we’re stronger than any rumor they can throw at us."</p><p>They both laughed again, this time the sound easy and free, as they leaned back together on the couch. The noise from the press faded into the background. They didn’t need to worry about what was being said or speculated. What mattered was what they had—what they were building.</p><p>And what they had was more than enough.</p><p>They shared a quiet, knowing look, both of them feeling the quiet magic of being together, just the two of them , their pets and their son. The world could speculate all it wanted, but they knew the truth. They were a family, happy, in love, and absolutely nothing was going to change that.</p><p>Later that evening, after they had put Nicky to sleep in his crib, Rio and Agatha decided to do something for themselves. Agatha poured them both a glass of wine, and they settled onto the couch once more, casually scrolling through their social media to check in with friends.</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but smile when she saw Alice’s Snapchat pop up. It was just Alice being her usual goofy self, pulling faces to the camera.</p><p>Caption: I’m so happy for you both. You guys are everything</p><p>Rio sent a quick reply, letting Alice know how much they appreciated her support, while Agatha, meanwhile, sent a quick message to Bucky, who was in the middle of a live interview.</p><p>Bucky’s response made both of them burst into laughter: You two are unbreakable. I see all these rumors and all I can think is, Yeah, right, they’re so happy.</p><p>The love and support from their inner circle were all that mattered. And Rio couldn’t help but feel grateful for how far they had come.</p><p>As they snuggled together on the couch, Agatha’s hand gently resting on Rio’s, the room was filled with a comfortable silence. Rio leaned over and kissed her softly, a silent promise to stay strong, to be there for each other through everything. They were untouchable, unbothered by the chaos outside their little bubble.</p><p>And as they pulled the blanket over themselves, settling in for the night, Rio whispered quietly into Agatha’s ear.</p><p>"Let them speculate. We’ve got everything we need right here."</p><p>Agatha smiled, her eyes glinting in the soft light. "I love you."</p><p>“I love you more”.</p><p>And with that, they drifted off to sleep, knowing they had all they needed.</p><p>A month had passed since Nicky’s birth, and Rio still couldn’t get over how quickly Agatha had bounced back. Agatha’s body, once round with pregnancy, was now back to its natural shape, and she looked as radiant as ever. Rio couldn’t help but marvel at how strong and beautiful Agatha was. It seemed like she was glowing even more now that she had their son in her life.</p><p>Agatha was sitting on the couch, cradling Nicky in her arms as she breastfed him. The scene was intimate, peaceful, and filled with so much love that it made Rio’s heart swell. The way Agatha looked at their son, the tenderness with which she held him—Rio knew, without a doubt, that they were both absolutely meant to be parents.</p><p>Rio was sitting beside them, her hand gently resting on Agatha's leg as she watched the two of them, her emotions swirling. She was in awe of how natural Agatha was as a mother, how perfectly she fit into this role, even though it hadn’t been long. She couldn’t wait for the world to see just how beautiful their family was, but a part of her hesitated. The weight of the public’s scrutiny always loomed over them.</p><p>Agatha looked up at Rio and smiled softly, her eyes soft and full of affection. "What’s on your mind?" she asked, her voice a quiet hum of warmth.</p><p>Rio hesitated for a moment, her fingers tracing small patterns on Agatha’s knee. "I’ve been thinking," she began slowly, "about when we’ll tell everyone about Nicky. I mean, the press and fans are getting worse with speculations, and I can’t keep the joy of him to myself much longer. He’s just… so perfect, Agatha."</p><p>Agatha’s gaze softened even more, and she gently moved Nicky to her other arm, giving him a gentle kiss on the top of his head. "I know," she said, her voice full of thoughtfulness. "I’ve been thinking about that too. It feels strange, you know? Hiding this part of our lives when it’s the most beautiful thing that’s ever happened to me." She looked over at Rio, her expression serious but warm. "But we’ve kept it private for a reason. The world doesn't need to know everything, not yet, at least. We’ve had our own time, just the three of us, and I’m not ready to let go of that just yet."</p><p>Rio nodded, understanding where Agatha was coming from. The weight of their public lives was a heavy burden to carry, and Agatha had become fiercely protective of their little family. "I get that," Rio said softly. "But I also think Nicky deserves to be celebrated. We shouldn’t have to hide him forever. He’s part of our world now. He’s a part of us."</p><p>Agatha’s eyes twinkled, and she reached out to take Rio’s hand, squeezing it gently. "I’m not saying I want to hide him forever. But I want to do it on our terms, in our time. Maybe we’ll just... ease into it. Let the world get to know him slowly, when we feel ready."</p><p>Rio smiled, nodding in agreement. "Yeah, that sounds right. We can still share pieces of our joy without feeling overwhelmed by everything else."</p><p>Nicky gave a small, sleepy sound as he nursed, and Agatha laughed softly, brushing a lock of hair from his tiny face. "He’s so precious," she whispered, her voice filled with wonder. "I just want to protect him, keep him safe and happy."</p><p>Rio leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to Agatha’s temple. "We’ll protect him together. And when the time comes, we’ll share him with the world, but on our terms. He’s our son, and no one can take that away from us."</p><p>Agatha smiled up at her, her expression full of love and gratitude. "I love you so much, Rio. I’m so lucky to have you in my life, and Nicky’s life."</p><p>Rio’s heart swelled, and she leaned in to kiss Agatha’s lips, soft and tender. "I love you too, Agatha. And I love Nicky more than I ever thought possible. Our little family... it's everything to me."</p><p>They stayed like that for a while, just the three of them, basking in the quiet happiness that only a family could bring. Rio kept glancing at Nicky, watching as Agatha carefully tended to him, and she couldn’t help but smile. Their son was the greatest gift they had ever received, and she was beyond excited for the future they would build together.</p><p>After a few moments, Agatha broke the silence again, her voice thoughtful. "We can announce his birth soon. Maybe when we’ve settled a little more. But I’m happy to just enjoy these moments with you. That’s the most important thing to me."</p><p>Rio smiled, a sense of peace settling over her. "I’m happy with that too. We’ll do it when it feels right. Just us, at first."</p><p>Agatha nodded, her gaze soft and loving as she cradled Nicky close. "Exactly. Just us."</p><p>As they sat there, the world outside seemed to fade away, and it was just them—their love, their son, their quiet little family. And for now, that was all they needed.</p><p>After weeks of keeping their joy to themselves, Agatha and Rio sat down one evening, both of them feeling the excitement and the weight of what they were about to do. The time had come to share their beautiful son, Nicky, with the world.</p><p>It wasn’t something they took lightly. The press had already been speculating about their relationship, about Agatha's time away from public life, and about their quiet, private family life. But now, they had a moment that was theirs—a moment they wanted to share in their own way, on their own terms.</p><p>"I think we should do it on Instagram," Agatha said, looking at Rio, her voice filled with a mixture of excitement and calm determination. "It’s the best way to share him with the world, and to do it the way we want. Simple, private, but still... beautiful."</p><p>Rio nodded, her heart racing with a mix of nerves and excitement. "Yeah, I agree. No need to make it over the top, just something that feels... real. Something that represents who we are right now—just the three of us, figuring it all out together."</p><p>They decided to keep things simple, using one of the most intimate and precious moments they had experienced with Nicky. The photograph was black and white—timeless, tender, and honest. It showed the tiny hands of their newborn son, clutching their fingers, both of them holding onto him, their faces nowhere to be seen. It was a picture of their hands, intertwined with his.</p><p>The caption was brief, yet powerful. Agatha typed it out slowly, letting the words sink in:</p><p>Welcome to the world, Nicky Harkness Vidal. We’re so in love and settling into life as a family. Thank you for giving us this beautiful gift</p><p>With a final deep breath, Agatha hit the Post button on her public instagram.</p><p>The post was up, and almost instantly, their 180 million followers on Instagram began reacting. The comments section exploded with joy and well-wishes, while hashtags like #NickyHarknessVidal and #Agathario trended on Twitter within minutes. People couldn’t get enough of the intimate, beautiful photo, and the caption left them in awe.</p><p>From the moment the post was shared, the comments flooded in. There were fans from all over the world, offering their congratulations, some of them writing in multiple languages, others sharing their excitement about the couple becoming parents.</p><p>@OfficialHarkyfan: Oh my god, I’m crying 😭😭 Nicky is the most beautiful gift. You both are incredible. Congratulations 💖</p><p>@MamaBear23: SO happy for you both!! You’re going to be amazing parents. Sending all the love to your little family! 🍼💙</p><p>@StarsAndStripes: Such a beautiful moment shared! I respect your privacy, but thank you for letting us see this piece of your life. Welcome to the world, Nicky!! 🌟💫</p><p>It wasn’t just the fans who were commenting. Major news outlets and entertainment journalists began posting about it almost immediately. The narrative that had been building—questions about Agatha’s private life, about her time away from the public eye—was suddenly flipped into something heartwarming, joyful, and relatable.</p><p>@PopCultureDaily: BREAKING: Agatha Harkness and Rio introduce their son, Nicky, to the world in a touching Instagram post. Congratulations to the happy couple! 💖 #NickyHarknessVidal #FamilyGoals</p><p>The tabloids, who had previously speculated on everything from Agatha's mental health to a breakup with Rio, now had an entirely new narrative to run with. The focus shifted. People started to forget about the rumors of a split, and instead, they were enveloped in the joy and love that Agatha and Rio were sharing with their son.</p><p>Of course, the press wasn’t entirely without criticism. A few articles popped up questioning how the couple managed to keep their pregnancy and then birth of the baby out of the public eye for so long, but the overall response was overwhelmingly positive. Fans and followers celebrated Agatha’s transparency in the most meaningful way she knew how—through the simplicity of their family photo.</p><p>Later that night, Agatha and Rio sat together in the living room, Nicky nestled in his bassinet, sleeping soundly. They had read through the comments and the posts, grinning at the outpouring of love they were receiving. Agatha was leaned back, her legs stretched out on the couch, Rio curled up beside her. It was a quiet, peaceful moment, just the two of them processing everything.</p><p>"I can’t believe we did it," Rio said softly, still smiling at the phone screen, scrolling through the endless congratulations. "I’m so happy... I’m just so happy."</p><p>Agatha’s hand found Rio’s, and she squeezed it gently, her eyes full of love. "I know. Me too. It feels right, sharing this with everyone. But also... I still want to keep him protected, just between us sometimes. I don’t think I’ll ever get used to the spotlight being on him. He’s our little miracle."</p><p>Rio nodded. "I feel the same. He’s our world. I just want to protect him, give him everything."</p><p>Agatha smiled and kissed the top of Rio’s head. "We will. And we’ll take it one day at a time. I love that we’re doing this together, on our terms."</p><p>Rio smiled back up at her, her heart full. "Yeah, me too. We’re a family."</p><p>Meanwhile, Bucky and Alice were already reacting to the post. Alice sent Rio a text that was filled with emojis and exclamation points.</p><p>Alice: OH MY GOD, YOU DID IT!! 😭😭😭 He’s PERFECT! I can’t believe the world knows you two are parents now. He’s already got the whole world in his hands. I’m so happy for you both!!! 💙💙💙</p><p>Bucky, on the other hand, had taken a more relaxed approach. He sent Rio a Snap video of him lying on his couch, looking ridiculously comfortable in his pajamas.</p><p>Bucky’s Snap: Yo, you did it. You both did it. Nicky’s a lucky kid. He’s got two amazing parents. Let’s get a drink soon, yeah? I’m pumped for you two."</p><p>Agatha was in stitches watching the Snap, knowing that Bucky was going to continue to spoil Nicky.</p><p>As the comments continued to flood in, Rio and Agatha sat there in quiet contentment, knowing they had made the right decision. Their world had just become a little bit bigger, a little bit brighter, and now it was time for them to enjoy every second of it.</p>

<p>A few days after sharing their son Nicky's first glimpse with the world on Instagram, Agatha was preparing for her first interview since giving birth. It was scheduled with a popular morning talk show, and she was set to talk about her new film, navigating motherhood, and how life had changed after Nicky’s birth.</p><p>Although Agatha had hesitated about stepping back into the public eye so soon, the support from Rio and their shared commitment to protecting Nicky had given her the confidence to do so. They'd made a pact that Nicky's face would remain private for now, and they’d keep their family life as peaceful and out of the spotlight as possible.</p><p>On the morning of the interview, Agatha was in her trailer, a soft light filling the room as her makeup artist applied the finishing touches. She wore a loose, flowing dress that didn’t cling to her postpartum body. The last month had been a whirlwind—juggling the exhaustion of motherhood with the love she had for their son, and her drive to return to work. It was the kind of chaos she was still getting used to, but Agatha wouldn't have changed it for anything.</p><p>Nicky was beside her, swaddled in a blanket, peacefully asleep in a stroller. Rio sat next to Agatha, offering her a soft smile as she carefully cradled their son’s little hand. Rio, ever the attentive partner, checked on Nicky every few minutes, ensuring he was comfortable.</p><p>"Are you ready for this?" Rio asked quietly, her voice laced with a bit of nerves but filled with warmth.</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, running her fingers through her hair. "As ready as I’ll ever be," she said, giving Rio a reassuring smile. "Just... trying to remember that Nicky is my priority. No one’s getting pictures of him, until we’re ready."</p><p>Rio nodded and leaned over to kiss Agatha’s forehead. “I’m here for you. No matter what, we’ve got this.”</p><p>With a final glance at Nicky, who was now awake and blinking up at Agatha with sleepy eyes, she leaned down and whispered, "I love you, my love."</p><p>The interview was held in a relaxed studio lounge, with cozy couches and large windows letting in natural light. Agatha had requested a quiet corner to breastfeed Nicky during breaks in the discussion. She was determined to keep him close, and the team had graciously agreed.</p><p>The host, a seasoned TV personality, greeted Agatha with a warm smile. “Agatha, it’s so wonderful to see you back, and congratulations on your beautiful baby, Nicky. He’s adorable.”</p><p>Agatha beamed. “Thank you so much. These past few weeks have been life-changing. It’s been a little overwhelming, but I wouldn’t trade it for the world.”</p><p>As the interview progressed, Agatha alternated between answering the host’s questions and looking lovingly at Nicky in the breaks, who was nestled in her arms, feeding quietly. She spoke about the joy of motherhood, the challenges, and the surreal experience of being a new parent.</p><p>"How has motherhood been so far?" the host asked. "You’ve been so private about your personal life—how are you adjusting to everything with Nicky?"</p><p>Agatha's face softened as she gazed past the camera at their son. "It’s incredible," she said. "It's a lot, but it's also... so fulfilling. Rio’s been an amazing partner and mother. She’s incredible with Nicky. We’re adjusting together, and it's been a beautiful ride so far."</p><p>Rio, seated with Nicky, smiled, her hand resting protectively on the stroller. "She’s handling everything so gracefully. I’m the one who’s learning every day." She called towards the camera.</p><p>The host laughed and looked at Rio. "I’m sure! So, will we get to see more of Nicky in the future? I know you’ve kept him out of the public eye for now."</p><p>Agatha nodded, her eyes filled with love as she looked at Rio. "Right now, we’re just trying to keep him as private as possible, especially while he's so little. We want him to have a normal, peaceful childhood. Maybe one day, when he’s older, we’ll share more, but for now, he’s ours to protect."</p><p>The host smiled understandingly. "That makes sense. I think all your fans understand that. You’re already giving them a glimpse into your world by sharing with us today."</p><p>As the interview wrapped up, Agatha felt a sense of relief. The weight of the public’s curiosity had felt heavy at times, but she knew she was doing the right thing by keeping Nicky's life as private as possible.</p><p>After the cameras stopped rolling, Agatha let out a deep breath. "I’m glad that’s over," she admitted, leaning back on the chair.</p><p>Rio, ever the support, squeezed her hand. "You did amazing as always."</p><p>Agatha smiled, looking at Nicky, who had fallen asleep in her arms after his feeding session. "He’s just the best."</p><p>As they gathered their things, Agatha looked at Rio, feeling a rush of gratitude. "You’re amazing, Rio. You’ve been incredible through all of this."</p><p>Rio chuckled softly. "I’m just following your lead, sweetheart. But I have to admit, seeing you with Nicky… it’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen."</p><p>Agatha leaned over and kissed her gently. "I’m so glad we’re doing this together. I couldn’t imagine doing it with anyone else."</p><p>Later that evening, after the interview aired, Agatha and Rio shared some quiet time at home. They scrolled through the countless messages of support from fans, friends, and family. It was overwhelming but comforting to know that they had the backing of so many people.</p><p>“I think we did good,” Rio said, leaning back on the couch. “We showed them that we’re happy, that we’re doing this together. That’s all we really need to focus on."</p><p>Agatha nodded, feeling content. "We’re doing it our way. And I wouldn’t want it any other way."</p><p>As they spent the night cuddling together, with Nicky asleep in his crib nearby, Agatha knew that no matter what the world thought, she had everything she needed right there. A beautiful partner in Rio, and the love of their precious son, Nicky. Together, they had a family—one that was stronger than anything the world could throw at them.</p>

<p>It was a sunny morning in early spring when Agatha and Rio’s wedding day finally arrived. The excitement had been building for months, though they had kept things intimate, not wanting any media frenzy or paparazzi lurking at every corner. It would be a quiet, private affair—a celebration of their love, surrounded by the people who truly mattered to them.</p><p>Agatha had insisted on no grand spectacle, just a simple ceremony. Rio, however, had her own ideas of making the day as beautiful as possible, without the public eye taking center stage. They’d chosen a secluded venue near the beach, tucked away in a lush, green corner of the world, where only their son and closest family and friends would be present. The air was crisp, the sound of waves gently crashing on the shore, and the scent of fresh flowers filled the air, each bloom hand selected and prepared by Rio herself.</p><p>The morning was calm, but inside the venue, the excitement was palpable. Rio stood in front of the mirror in her dressing room, adjusting her dress. It was simple yet elegant, with lace detailing, hugging her curves in all the right ways, and a modest train that pooled at her feet. Her hair was styled in loose waves, cascading down her back. She took a deep breath, feeling a mixture of excitement and nervousness. She had always dreamed of this day, but now that it was finally here, the reality of marrying Agatha made her heart flutter.</p><p>She glanced at her phone, seeing a message from Agatha.</p><p>Agatha: Are you ready for this? I can't wait to see you walking down that aisle</p><p>Rio smiled and quickly typed back.</p><p>Rio: I’m ready if you are. I love you so much</p><p>Agatha’s response was swift, as always.</p><p>Agatha: I love you more. I’ll see you in a bit, my beautiful fiancée soon to be wife</p><p>Rio’s heart skipped a beat. The word wife felt strange but so incredibly perfect.</p><p>The ceremony itself was held outside, the soft whirl of wind and sea  providing a peaceful soundtrack to the intimate moment. Agatha stood at the front, looking more stunning than Rio had ever seen her. She wore a soft, ivory suit, the jacket tailored perfectly to her form, and the pants flared just slightly at the ankle. Her white shirt underneath was unbuttoned just enough to reveal the delicate necklace that Rio had given her. She was glowing. Agatha's hair, normally messy in the best way, had been neatly styled into a low bun with loose strands framing her face.</p><p>As Rio walked down the aisle, she was in awe of how beautiful Agatha looked. She couldn’t help but smile as Agatha’s eyes met hers, and for a moment, it felt like everything stopped. The world faded, and it was just the two of them, eyes locked in a gaze that was filled with love, longing, and a promise of forever.</p><p>When Rio finally stood beside Agatha, the look on her face was filled with an emotion that took Agatha’s breath away.</p><p>“You’re so beautiful,” Agatha whispered, her voice filled with awe.</p><p>Rio grinned, holding back tears. “I should be the one saying that to you.”</p><p>The officiant, a close friend of Lilias, started the ceremony as Alice and Bucky stood either side, Nicky held in Lilias arms just slightly behind them.</p><p>Rio felt as though she was in a dream. She couldn’t believe she was standing here, about to marry Agatha. Their journey together had been filled with ups and downs, challenges, laughter, and tears—but now, they were here, ready to start this new chapter as wives, as a family.</p><p>The vows were short but heartfelt. Agatha spoke first, her voice steady but thick with emotion. “I stand here today not because it’s the next step, but because you are the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. I promise to always cherish you, to love you through the good and bad, and to support you in everything you do. You make me better, and I will spend every day showing you how much I love you.”</p><p>Tears glistened in Rio’s eyes as she took Agatha’s hands in hers. “I don’t have the words to fully express how much you mean to me. You’ve made me the happiest I’ve ever been. I love you for exactly who you are—strong, kind, beautiful, and full of passion. I promise to always be by your side, through every challenge and every joy. You are everything to me.”</p><p>The officiant smiled, and with a gentle nod, he said, “By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you wife and wife. You may kiss each other.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, and the kiss was soft at first, tender, like the promise of everything yet to come. But as the kiss deepened, it became something else entirely—passionate, raw, filled with all the emotions they had both been holding inside. It was a kiss that spoke of a lifetime of love, of two people who had found their other half.</p><p>As they pulled apart, Agatha laughed softly, resting her forehead against Rio’s. “I love you so much.”</p><p>“I love you, too,” Rio whispered back, her voice thick with emotion.</p><p>After the ceremony, they celebrated with their family and friends. The reception was held at the same venue, a small, intimate gathering with just a few dozen people. There was no need for extravagant decorations or a massive cake—just a few candles, a beautiful table set for dinner, and soft music filling the air.</p><p>Lilia, was the first to raise a glass in a toast. “To Agatha and Rio,” she began, her voice slightly wobbly. “You two have always had a special connection, and it fills me with joy to see you both come together in this way not just as mothers but as wives. I couldn’t ask for a better partner for my daughter.”</p><p>Tears welled in Agatha’s eyes as she raised her glass, nodding at her mother. She turned to Rio, who smiled brightly, her hand resting on her arm.</p><p>“To love,” Agatha said, her voice steady but thick with emotion. “And to our beautiful family, now and always.”</p><p>The night went on, filled with laughter, dancing, and stories shared between their closest friends and family. Agatha and Rio couldn’t have been happier, surrounded by the people who had supported them through everything.</p><p>As the evening wore on, and the music slowed, Agatha pulled Rio close. “This is it, babe. This is our forever.”</p><p>Rio smiled softly, her eyes glistening with tears. “Yeah, it is.”</p><p>Everything felt perfectly in place. Their love, their family, and their future—all coming together in one beautiful moment.</p>
