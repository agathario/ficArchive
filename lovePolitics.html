  <b>Love &amp; Politics</b>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is this thing over yet?” Rio sighed, flopping down next to Agatha, the skirts of her ridiculously poofy pink ball gown fluttering around her. Rio glared at the tulle and lace surrounding her lower half as if they had personally wronged her, crossing her arms over her chest, which was being pushed up by a bodice that was </span>
  <em>
    <span>way</span>
  </em>
  <span> too tight around her chest. They made her tits look fantastic, though, and Rio didn’t miss the downward flicker of Agatha’s eyes. “I </span>
  <em>
    <span>need</span>
  </em>
  <span> to take this thing off before I suffocate. Are my lips turning blue? I swear they’re turning blue.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your lips are as pink as ever,” Agatha murmured, looking down at her phone. “It’s not even nine yet. We’ve only been here two hours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ugh,” Rio huffed, placing her head down on her arms on the table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha tugged her back up by her braid, careful not to muss her hair too much. “Head off the table, Rio,” she said. “You’re a grown woman, remember?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then why did you dress me like a cupcake?” Rio grumbled. “Get me </span>
  <em>
    <span>out</span>
  </em>
  <span> of this dress, Agatha!” Her hand stroked at Agatha’s thigh as she leaned in. “You know you want to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“One more hour,” Agatha murmured back, her eyes not leaving the phone screen. “We’re almost at our goal for the night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Marisol Vidal was running for re-election. That meant charity galas and fundraising events and stupid, poofy dresses that Rio hated wearing because they reminded her of her Quinces, which she </span>
  <em>
    <span>also</span>
  </em>
  <span> hated. At least she’d gotten to feel up Claudia Gutierrez back then. Now, Agatha wouldn’t even let her touch her, slapping her hand away as it inched too far up her thigh. Rio pouted at her, but Agatha continued to ignore her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re ten thousand away from our goal for the night,” Agatha said. “Go chat up some rich white liberals for their money and then we’ll talk.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ugh,” Rio said, sinking lower in her seat. “What do you think I’ve been </span>
  <em>
    <span>doing</span>
  </em>
  <span> all night? That old man over there’s been following me around, placing his hand </span>
  <em>
    <span>firmly</span>
  </em>
  <span> on my ass all night.” Agatha glanced up to see an old man with stooped shoulders, white hair, thick glasses, and a fuzzy caterpillar mustache smiling at them. He wiggled his fingers at them in a wave. She offered him a polite smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He donated three mil to your mother’s campaign,” she said. “Be nice to him. We like him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I didn’t punch him,” Rio said. “I think that’s about all you can ask of me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I admire your restraint,” she said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should,” Rio husked, leaning closer, “because it’s taking </span>
  <em>
    <span>all</span>
  </em>
  <span> my restraint not to take you by the wrist and </span>
  <em>
    <span>drag</span>
  </em>
  <span> you toward the women’s room right now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No more scandals, please,” Agatha said, her tone bored as she slapped Rio’s hand away again. “Not this close to the election.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re no fun,” Rio huffed, continuing to pout.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure you would have had </span>
  <em>
    <span>plenty</span>
  </em>
  <span> of fun,” Agatha said, “if you hadn’t blown off the escort I secured for you tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who? Alice Wu?” Rio snorted. “She looked boring. Not nearly as fun as the date I ended up with, hmm?” She placed her hand back on Agatha’s lap, but Agatha stood brushing her hand away as Rio’s mother approached, looking stunning in her own midnight blue ball gown. She was like an older, much happier version of Rio, with a few more lines around her eyes and mouth and salt-and-pepper hair tied up in a complicated updo on her head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How’s everything going?” she asked Agatha. “Are you behaving, </span>
  <em>
    <span>cariño</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Sí, mami</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Rio retorted. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Como siempre</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” Marisol let out a scoff of disbelief, even as she cupped her daughter’s face in her hands and pressed a kiss to her forehead, rubbing away the lipstick mark that was left there. Rio smiled softly up at her mother, affection clear in her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You listen to Agatha,” she said. “Do whatever she tells you, and soon, we will get through this together. Just four more years and then no more galas, yes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Rio said, softly, smiling up at her mother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Buena chica</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Marisol said, pinching her daughter’s cheek. She turned to Agatha. “How close are we?” Agatha showed her the phone screen and Marisol let out a low whistle. “We’re almost there. I can finally take off these damn shoes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just a tiny bit further,” Agatha promised. “I think I saw Senator Romanoff toying with her checkbook earlier. You wanna go over and chat her up?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s!” Marisol said, taking Agatha by the hand. Rio started to follow, but Marisol placed her hand on her shoulder, keeping her seated. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Quédate aquí.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a puff of air through her nose, watching as Agatha and her mother approached the senator, immediately falling into polite conversation. Her mother had always been so good at conversation, so charming and personable. Rio had struggled slightly in that department in her youth and had only really gotten marginally better - usually only with women whose beds she was trying to seduce her way into. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that resulted in scandals. And scandals were not good for her mother’s campaign. Especially after she was caught with the daughter of an ambassador from a </span>
  <em>
    <span>very </span>
  </em>
  <span>homophobic country. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So Marisol’s campaign manager, Agatha Harkness, had taken to arranging escorts for her from incredibly high profile and privileged families. Which is where Alice Wu came in. She was the daughter of a world-renowned rock star, but she was also…boring. At least in Rio’s opinion. She was probably nice, but for a rock star’s daughter, she was…meh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you </span>
  <em>
    <span>so</span>
  </em>
  <span> much for your contribution, Senator,” Agatha exclaimed from across the room. She was shaking the redheaded senator’s hand way too enthusiastically. Next to her, Marisol was beaming, a look of relief on her face that Rio recognized.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mami was ready to go to </span>
  <em>
    <span>bed</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio waited until Agatha and her mother said goodbye and started to approach her before she stood up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can we leave now?” she asked too loudly, but she didn’t give a single fuck. She was ready to </span>
  <em>
    <span>go</span>
  </em>
  <span>. She needed to take this dress off. She needed to take </span>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha’s</span>
  </em>
  <span> dress off. It was beautiful and purple and she looked </span>
  <em>
    <span>damn</span>
  </em>
  <span> good in it, but it would look even better on the floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shh!” Marisol said, taking her daughter’s hand and tugging her to her side. “You need to work on your subtly, mi amor,” she said. “I just need to make the rounds one more time. Agatha will take you back to the hotel, okay?” She pressed a kiss to Rio’s cheek. Rio tried not to smile too widely as she caught Agatha’s eye.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sure you don’t want me to walk around with you?” Agatha asked, looking away from Rio. “It really wouldn’t be a problem.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t be ridiculous,” Marisol said, offering Agatha a kind smile as she patted her on the hand. “I’ll be fine. I have Marco and Louis to protect me, and you deserve a rest. Order some room service and get some sleep. Our flight is </span>
  <em>
    <span>very</span>
  </em>
  <span> early in the morning. Also, make sure that </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span> one stays in her </span>
  <em>
    <span>own</span>
  </em>
  <span> bed.” She looked at Rio, who played innocent, batting her eyelashes. Marisol was not buying it, of course. “I will </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> have my daughter </span>
  <em>
    <span>corrupt </span>
  </em>
  <span>another young woman.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They would be </span>
  <em>
    <span>happily</span>
  </em>
  <span> corrupted,” Rio retorted, her gaze finding a young woman across the room. She winked and watched with pleasure as a cheek spread across the woman’s cheeks and collarbones. “Always have been before.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha snapped and Rio’s eyes returned to her, biting back her grin at the disapproving look in her eyes. She was </span>
  <em>
    <span>jealous</span>
  </em>
  <span>. How cute. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No more scandals,” Marisol huffed, reaching out to cup Rio’s chin, turning her to face her mother. Rio pouted at her like a child, nearly stomping her foot. “You are a grown woman,” Marisol said. “Nearly forty years old with a law degree, your own practice, and a successful career. You could find a wife to settle down with, maybe give me a grandchild or two, eh? Why do you </span>
  <em>
    <span>insist</span>
  </em>
  <span> on sleeping with the daughters of my colleagues?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A hot woman is a hot woman, mami,” Rio said, shrugging. “I’m not made of stone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>No más</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Marisol said, warningly. “We have two months left before the election. Do you want that awful man to win? To undo </span>
  <em>
    <span>all</span>
  </em>
  <span> the good I’ve done in the last four years in this country?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s shoulders slumped. “No,” she said. She may have been nearly forty, but she was not immune to her mother’s chastisements. Even being six inches taller than her now, she felt small under her mother’s gaze. “I’ll be good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You better be,” Marisol said, hitting her with that Mom Look once more, before leaning up to brush a kiss against Rio’s forehead again. “My good girl. You go back to the hotel with Agatha, </span>
  <em>
    <span>sí</span>
  </em>
  <span>? Have a drink, take off that </span>
  <em>
    <span>ridiculous</span>
  </em>
  <span> dress they shoved you in, and get some sleep. I am not fighting to get you out of that bed tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll handle all of that,” Agatha promised, placing her hand on Rio’s back, right above the neckline of the dress, her thumb brushing against naked skin. Rio tried to suppress her shiver. “You just do your thing and we’ll see you in the lobby tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My angel,” Marisol said, reaching up to cup Agatha’s cheeks, pulling her down to place a kiss on </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span> forehead, as well. Agatha flushed slightly, smiling affectionately down at the older woman. “You keep this girl in line, won’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will do my best,” Agatha said, placing her hand back on Rio’s back, gently guiding her toward the exit as she waved to Marisol. “We’ll see you in the morning. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Buenas noches</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Buenas noches, amores,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Marisol called after them, watching them with a knowing grin as they turned, heading toward the door. Rio leaned in and whispered something into Agatha’s ear, which sent a visible shiver down the older woman’s spine. Marisol rolled her eyes. They thought they were so sneaky, but she wasn’t born yesterday.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the limousine on the way to the hotel, Rio pressed her entire body to Agatha’s even as the slightly older woman continued to look at her phone, her arms slung around Rio’s shoulders. Rio gazed up at her from her spot at Agatha’s shoulder, pouting slightly at being ignored.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you still looking at?” Rio huffed, glancing at the screen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just setting my alarms for tomorrow,” Agatha informed her. “We’ll need five just to get </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> out of bed in time for the flight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Only if you’re planning on tiring me out tomorrow,” Rio purred, pressing her lips to the column of Agatha’s neck, exposed by the deep vee of her dress. Agatha let out a soft sigh, her head lolling back as she allowed Rio to press soft kisses, her lipstick no doubt leaving red marks in their wake. Agatha’s hair played with the braid that was already fraying in Rio’s head. When she felt Rio’s teeth scrape at her pulse, she tugged her back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No visible marks,” Agatha reminded her. “Your mother thinks that the woman I’ve been seeing is in a whole other state, remember? I’m not trying to explain to her how her own campaign manager couldn’t keep it in her pants for one little out of town conference.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She knows,” Rio husked, pressing her lips more firmly against Agatha’s neck, but she made sure not to leave a hickey.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She </span>
  <em>
    <span>what</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” Agatha pushed her fully away now, eyes wide with panic. “Your mother </span>
  <em>
    <span>knows</span>
  </em>
  <span> about us?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Rio huffed, “obviously. But she doesn’t really care, especially since if I’m sleeping with </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>, I’m not sleeping with anybody else’s daughter.” She leaned in, her lips just brushing Agatha’s cheek before she was pushed away again. Rio let out a whine. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she moaned. “Come on. It’s not that big a deal. My mother </span>
  <em>
    <span>likes</span>
  </em>
  <span> you. She approves. She would have said something if she didn’t. She probably thinks you’re good for me or whatever.” She rolled her eyes, blushing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That woman is like the mother I never had,” Agatha said, her heart beginning to race. “And now she knows that I’m fucking the daughter that she </span>
  <em>
    <span>actually</span>
  </em>
  <span> has. Fuck.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And, as I said, she </span>
  <em>
    <span>approves</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Rio said. “Otherwise, she could have easily had you taken out by a sniper.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why would you </span>
  <em>
    <span>say</span>
  </em>
  <span> that?” Agatha groaned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut me up,” Rio husked, grabbing Agatha’s face and pulling it toward her own. Agatha moaned against her lips despite herself, her hands reaching for Rio’s hips, tangling slightly in the tulle and lace and </span>
  <em>
    <span>why</span>
  </em>
  <span> had Agatha chosen this dress again? She glanced down as she pulled away, eyeing the way that Rio’s modest chest was </span>
  <em>
    <span>amplified </span>
  </em>
  <span>by the tightness of her bodice pushing her tits up.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh. That’s why</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha lowered her head to press her lips to Rio’s collarbone, pressing kisses across the expanse of skin to the valley between Rio’s breasts, where she sucked a tiny red hickey that could be hidden with most other clothing. Rio let out a tiny moan, her hands sinking into Agatha’s hair, holding her in place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take it off,” Rio begged, one of her hands reaching for the ties on the corset that held the top of her dress together. Agatha’s hand slapped hers away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Patience,” she husked, pressed kisses up her chest to her shoulder, turning her head so that her lips were right in Rio’s ear. “Be a good girl,” she husked, “and you’ll get a reward.” Rio let out a shuddering breath, biting her lip as her fingers tightened their hold on Agatha’s hair, moaning pitifully.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took another fifteen minutes for them to pull up to the curb outside the Plaza hotel, their driver, Ty, practically flattened as he attempted to help them out of the back of the limo, Rio bursting from it first with Agatha following casually behind, placing a couple of twenties into Ty’s hand as she gave him an apologetic smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Seven AM tomorrow,” she said to him. He nodded, then shook his head in amusement as he watched Agatha follow the ball of pink that was the President’s daughter. The secret service was already waiting from them at the entrance, flanking them as they walked into the building, Agatha’s hand on Rio’s lower back, guiding her with a firm touch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio was already practically ripping the dress off of herself before Agatha even got the door to their suite unlocked. She had stopped booking separate rooms long ago, using the excuse that she could keep a better eye on Rio if they were at least in the same space. It was an excuse, she knew now, that she didn’t really need. President Vidal already knew about her relationship with her daughter, and Agatha was never going to live that down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was also </span>
  <em>
    <span>never</span>
  </em>
  <span> going to own up to it, even as she shoved Rio into the suite and smiled politely at the secret service agents that would be stationed outside their door all night, likely not deaf to what was about to happen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were decent at being discreet, at least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The second the door was shut behind her, Agatha turned to Rio with a fiery gaze, her blue eyes settling on the flushed face of her…what even were they? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had been a year, almost to the day, since they’d first slept together after some gala that kicked off the new election cycle for Marisol Vidal’s campaign. Agatha had worked on some lower-level campaigns in the time between Marisol’s first run and her second, but the second she got the call from the President, she was on the next flight out, barely getting any sleep in the twenty-four hours between the call and the gala.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was her original excuse for falling prey to Rio Vidal’s charms. She’d been able to resist the woman before that. Rio was only five years her junior, but there was something almost </span>
  <em>
    <span>youthful</span>
  </em>
  <span> about the way she had pursued Agatha the first time they’d met, when Marisol was still just running for the Governor of New Jersey. Agatha had been in her thirties then, an out queer woman, and dating another woman who would eventually dump her because of her work getting in the way of their relationship. Agatha hadn’t even blinked twice at it, a little relieved to not have another distraction away from her career. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio Vidal had been well-known for </span>
  <em>
    <span>years</span>
  </em>
  <span> as a flirt, bedding the daughters of several other Senators, Congressmen, and Governors as her mother ran for each office. It had never been so bad as to cost her mother the elections, however, for which both Agatha and Marisol were grateful. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But then, once Marisol was elected President, she had set her eyes on the daughters of ambassadors and diplomats, getting herself involved in countless sex scandals, which Rio had scoffed at. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not like either of us is </span>
  <em>
    <span>married</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she’d said, the first time Agatha had confronted her over a scandalous headline. “What’s the big deal?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Homosexuality is punishable by </span>
  <em>
    <span>death</span>
  </em>
  <span> in her country!” Agatha had hissed, practically slapping Rio with the paper. “You could have just condemned this poor woman to exile!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nobody’s going to kill the daughter of an ambassador,” Rio had huffed. “Besides, she’s engaged. To a man. And nobody can </span>
  <em>
    <span>prove</span>
  </em>
  <span> that anything sexual happened. As far as anybody knows, we just had an innocent sleepover.” She grinned up at Agatha, pushing her tongue into her cheek. Agatha’s eye had twitched in response.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was the day that she’d begun to set up dates for Rio, escorts to bring her to events and keep her from wandering too close to the young women in the room that could cause headaches for her mother - and Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio always found a way to sneak off and get herself in trouble though.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The night at the gala, Agatha hadn’t had the time to set up an escort for her, so she had just done it herself, showing up at Rio’s hotel room in a three-piece suit and a garment bag with a forest green dress that was modest and classy. Rio’s face had been flushed as she eyed Agatha in her suit, which was lilac in color and fit her </span>
  <em>
    <span>very</span>
  </em>
  <span> well. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who’s my escort tonight?” Rio had asked, taking the garment bag from Agatha as the other woman strutted in, using every bit of her limited energy to not fall directly on the bed and sleep for three days straight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am,” Agatha said, with an air of confidence as she poured herself a cup of freshly-brewed coffee from the machine in Rio’s kitchen. She was thankful for the other woman’s caffeine addiction. “Get changed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes had widened at that, watching as Agatha sipped her coffee. Then a mischievous grin came over her face and she immediately began to undress in front of the other woman. Agatha’s brain had buffered for about ten seconds, trying to reconcile what she was seeing before it registered and she turned away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span> are you doing?” she ground out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Getting changed,” Rio retorted, nonchalantly, “like you said.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t you have a bathroom?” Agatha asked, her face flushing as she continued to look away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t say to use the bathroom to change,” Rio had retorted. “Shit, I can’t get this stupid zipper down. Can you help me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned around, the mug of coffee slipping from her fingers at the sight before her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio Vidal, President’s daughter and America’s Lesbian Playgirl, was fully nude, standing beside the opened garment bag, her fingers playing with the zipper of the dress inside, which indeed did not want to come down. Agatha’s face was flaming, her heart failing, her lungs refusing to do their damn jobs as she stared at the woman she’d known since she was in her mid-twenties, still at law school. She looked as though she hadn’t aged a day, even at nearly forty years old. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha ignored her hammering heart - and the naked body of the woman next to her - as she unzipped the dress and tossed it at Rio, quickly walking away from her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Put that on,” she said. “I’ll be outside.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t turn to look at Rio as she stepped out of the hotel room, standing in the hotel room flanked by two secret service agents. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She stripped in front of you, huh?” one agent, Tripp, asked, grinning down at her. Agatha nodded. “Yeah, she does that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a groan, covering her flaming face with her hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>This woman has no shame</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p><span>Agatha had been unable to think of much else other than Rio’s naked body all that night, but it was hard to do that when the woman in question was on her arm, whispering things in her ear that were </span><em><span>not</span></em> <em><span>meant for polite conversation</span></em><span>. Agatha was usually able to ignore her, but she was so tired, so mentally and physically exhausted from being awake for over twenty-four hours at the time, that, by the end of the night, she didn’t even protest when Rio kissed Agatha at her door as Agatha attempted to drop her off to her room. She </span><em><span>embraced</span></em><span> it, actually, her arms wrapping around Rio as they disappeared into the room, ripping each other’s clothes off in a trail that ended on Rio’s bed.</span></p><p>
  <span>Agatha was definitely </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> too tired to take an active part in what happened next, but that didn’t mean she didn’t regret it the next morning, when she awoke in Rio’s arms, the other woman wrapped around her like a koala bear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> also didn’t mean that she didn’t do it again - twice - before they were meant to meet Marisol for brunch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was surprisingly easy to fall into Rio’s bed after the first time they’d had sex. Agatha could actually understand why so many of the ‘straight’ daughters of other country leaders had fallen for her charms. What she could do with her fingers and lips should have been illegal - and it was, in several countries, Agatha was certain - but it was irresistible. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And having Agatha to take out all her sexual frustrations seemed to </span>
  <em>
    <span>work</span>
  </em>
  <span> on Rio. Instead of going after other young women to seduce into her bed, she merely flirted with them casually before turning her attention back to Agatha, who rewarded her for the lack of scandals with her own fingers and tongue and a whole lot more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It worked for them. Agatha hated to think what would happen </span>
  <em>
    <span>after</span>
  </em>
  <span> the election, whether Marisol won or didn’t, when there wouldn’t be a need for her </span>
  <em>
    <span>services</span>
  </em>
  <span> anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But it was kind of hard to think about that when Rio’s mouth was raining kisses down her body, her hands working the zipper on Agatha’s back, pulling down her ball gown, which was classy and elegant and covered way too much of her body to be needed right at this second.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once Rio successfully got the zipper down, she immediately pulled down the bodice of Agatha’s dress, letting out a hot moan at the skin that was revealed, her nipples pebbling in the cool air of the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No bra?” Rio husked, her breath hot against Agatha’s chest. Agatha shivered, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No need,” she said, gasping as Rio wrapped her mouth around one of her nipples, teasing the other one with sure fingers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s fingers started to fiddle with the ties around Rio’s waist, desperate to loosen them, to pull the tight bodice away from Rio’s chest, to see her own breasts freed from their constraints, but she couldn’t do much with Rio continuing to suck and bite and soothe away the marks she was leaving all over Agatha’s breasts - one of the only places Agatha allowed her to leave hickeys. Rio lifted one of her breasts and placed a kiss right next to the tattoo of a dandelion Agatha had over her ribcage. It was the result of a dare in grad school, the seeds of the fuzzy little flower fluttering away toward her opposite breast as if carried on a gust of wind. Rio had found it their first night together, tracing her finger over the trail of seedlings, pressing her lips against them like she did now. Agatha’s fingers played with her braid, removing the tie that kept it from unraveling. She ran her fingers through the strands as Rio continued to lavish attention to her chest, relishing the way the curls twisted around her hands. Rio let out a groan that vibrated through Agatha’s chest at the feeling of Agatha’s hands playing with her hair undoubtedly sent shivers down her spine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One of the things that Agatha had learned about Rio in the last year since they’d started this </span>
  <em>
    <span>whatever</span>
  </em>
  <span> between them was that she absolutely </span>
  <em>
    <span>loved</span>
  </em>
  <span> having her hair played with. And Agatha, honestly, loved playing with Rio’s hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a win-win situation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take off your dress,” Agatha husked, giving up on the ties of her corset. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Now</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mmm,” Rio purred, backing away from her. “Yes, Mommy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> call me that,” Agatha huffed. “I am only five years older than you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm, five and a half,” Rio retorted, stepping back and making surprisingly quick work of the laces of her bodice, loosening the pastel pink top to her dress. “Would </span>
  <em>
    <span>Daddy</span>
  </em>
  <span> be better?” she asked, letting the loosened top fall down, revealing her chest. Agatha didn’t respond, all of her attention narrowing to the skin she revealed, her teeth sinking into her lower lip as her eyes glazed over with lust. “Come here, Daddy,” Rio purred, curling a finger in her direction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha wasted no time, pushing the lace sleeves of her own dress down before reaching out to cup Rio’s breasts, reveling in the groans that Rio let out at the touch. Rio pressed her chest into Agatha’s hands, taking a couple of steps forward until she could press her lips back to Agatha’s, her hands coming up to cup the other woman’s cheeks, the kiss soft and gentle and deep and…God, Agatha was going to miss this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She tried not to think about just how much she would miss it as she turned them around, shoving Rio down onto the bed that had been, until then, widely ignored. Her skirts fluttered up around her as Rio fell to the bed with a grunt, Agatha falling on top of her with a giggle, one hand catching herself next to Rio’s head while the other stayed pressed to her breast, still stroking her nipple with her thumb. Rio smiled up at her, almost adoringly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are surprisingly adorable,” she said, “for somebody so fucking hot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes, flushing. “Shut up,” she said, pressing her lips to Rio’s, keeping the kiss soft and brief as her hand abandoned Rio’s breast, stroking down her side, tangling slightly in her skirts as she searched for the hem of the dress, though her hand got lost along the way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just take it </span>
  <em>
    <span>off</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Rio huffed, attempting to push the skirt off of her body as she lifted her hips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait a second,” Agatha said, pressing her hips back down to the bed with her wandering hand. She lowered her mouth to press her lips between Rio’s breasts, pressing kisses there before she began to lower herself down Rio’s body, the tulle scratchy against her lips as she moved down the other woman’s body, slipping off the bed to kneel on the ground. She tugged Rio’s legs, pulling her to the very edge of the bed, and pushed up her skirts, her hands stroking up and down Rio’s thighs, getting closer to where they </span>
  <em>
    <span>both</span>
  </em>
  <span> wanted her until she touched…nothing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha popped her head back up above the pile of tulle and lace to see Rio staring down her body at her, teeth sunk into her lip as she gave Agatha a sultry grin. “The entire time?” she huffed. “You were naked under there </span>
  <em>
    <span>the entire time</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were sitting next to me the entire time,” Rio replied, her voice deep and husky: “they would have gotten ruined anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a groan, returning to her place between Rio’s thighs, her head obscured by the piles of pink tulle, but Rio didn’t need to see her. She could </span>
  <em>
    <span>feel</span>
  </em>
  <span> her. Agatha wasted no time in pressing her lips to Rio’s inner thighs, licking and sucking and biting and </span>
  <em>
    <span>definitely</span>
  </em>
  <span> leaving marks there that she would feel for days to come, but Rio couldn’t find it in her to care even a little bit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well, actually, she </span>
  <em>
    <span>did</span>
  </em>
  <span> care. She fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>loved</span>
  </em>
  <span> it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had never loved being marked in the past. She had never really cared for leaving </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span> mark on lovers in the past. But Agatha was…different.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s entire body shuddered when she felt Agatha’s tongue finally land between her legs, right where Rio wanted it. She let out a long moan as she watched her skirts move with Agatha’s head underneath them, felt her fingers and tongue spread her wider beneath the dress. Agatha was </span>
  <em>
    <span>so good</span>
  </em>
  <span> at what she did, in every sense of the word. Rio had had no doubts that she would be just as good in bed. She’d spent </span>
  <em>
    <span>years</span>
  </em>
  <span> trying to get the woman between her legs and now she never really wanted her to leave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a scary thought for Rio, who had never really slept with a singular woman on more than one occasion. She had been more of a serial lover, bedding a woman once - maybe twice, but always in the same twenty-four hour period - and leaving them. No woman had ever really </span>
  <em>
    <span>asked</span>
  </em>
  <span> for a second date, anyway, too intimidated by the power that her mother held and what that might mean for their future as a couple.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not Agatha, though. Despite the </span>
  <em>
    <span>very real</span>
  </em>
  <span> possibility that Agatha could have lost her job from sleeping with Rio, she had kept coming back to Rio’s bed, and Rio welcomed her back with open arms. She’d never been with anybody like Agatha Harkness. She’d never felt for anybody the way she felt for Agatha Harkness. She’d never been brought so quickly to the edge by anybody </span>
  <em>
    <span>quite</span>
  </em>
  <span> like Agatha </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucking</span>
  </em>
  <span> Harkness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hands clenched around her skirts, tugging the fabric up to bunch around her waist so that she could watch Agatha’s brown head of hair, curls falling loosely over her thighs like a curtain, as she lapped at Rio’s folds, one of the other woman’s hands stroking her, thumb on her clit while her index and middle fingers teased at her entrance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha,” Rio gasped, feeling herself flooded with even more warmth as her hips levitated off the bed when Agatha’s tongue hit a particularly sensitive spot. The hand that wasn’t fucking her came to rest on her hips, pushing Rio back down. Rio let out a whimper, wiggling her hips as much as she could with Agatha’s grip on them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio,” Agatha husked, the word vibrating through Rio’s entire body, making everything feel like it was burning up around her. “Be good,” Agatha said. “Be good and you’ll be rewarded.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Rio sighed. “Yes, Daddy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hadn’t meant to say it that time. The joke had long passed, but being told by Agatha Harkness to </span>
  <em>
    <span>be good</span>
  </em>
  <span> set a fire inside her, made her mind swim with lust, removed any and all filters that she may have had, however minimal. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please,” Rio begged. “Please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please what?” Agatha asked, looking up at her over the piled skirts. “Say it. Tell me what you want.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck me,” Rio gasped. “Make me come. Please, Daddy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s my </span>
  <em>
    <span>actual</span>
  </em>
  <span> name?” the woman asked, her thumb rubbing circles just around her clit, but not actually touching it. “Say it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Rio gasped. “Agatha, Agatha, Agatha, </span>
  <em>
    <span>please</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was desperate now. She had been desperate for it the entire night, teased by Agatha’s ball gown, which was slim and way more form-fitting than her own pink Disney princess disaster, but she hadn’t been able to </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> anything about it. She hadn’t even been tempted by the other ladies in the room, some of whom had sent her enticing looks of their own, as if beckoning her forward. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hadn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>wanted</span>
  </em>
  <span> any of them. She only wanted…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha!” Rio cried out when Agatha’s tongue entered her, one hand reaching down to press on Agatha’s head, her hips grinding as much as they could up into her mouth. “Agatha, oh </span>
  <em>
    <span>God</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” Her toes curled and her vision went white as her entire body tensed up and then suddenly relaxed, tears leaking from her eyes. “Oh god, Agatha,” she husked. “Oh god, I love you. I love you. I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was certain that she passed out then because, when she came to, she was fully naked, the lace and tulle cupcake ball gown in a pile on the floor, next to Agatha’s, and she was in the woman’s arms, still shuddering, on top of the bedspread, arms wrapped around her as lips pressed to her shoulders and cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Welcome back,” Agatha husked in her ear, nibbling at her earlobe. “That was a good one, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So good.” Rio wasn’t even going to attempt to deny it, turning her neck so that she could press a kiss to Agatha’s lips, tasting herself on her tongue. Agatha moaned into her mouth, her hand pressed to Rio’s jaw, Rio’s hand holding her wrist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Agatha pulled back, there was a look in her eyes that was so,</span>
  <em>
    <span> so </span>
  </em>
  <span>soft and it made Rio’s heart stutter in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What was that you said,” Agatha asked, “just then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s face went hot. She knew exactly what she had just said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I…I don’t remember,” she lied. “I was just…I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio,” Agatha said, her voice low with warning, “don’t lie to me. That wouldn’t be a very </span>
  <em>
    <span>good</span>
  </em>
  <span> thing to do.” Her thumb swept over the ridge of Rio’s cheekbone, swiping away a tear she hadn’t even realized fell. “Tell me again,” Agatha asked, a look of slight desperation in her eyes. “Please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio swallowed, looking into the clear blue depths of her lover’s eyes. She took a deep breath, one of her hands finding Agatha’s, linking their fingers together between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you,” she said, her voice a little shaky. She’d never said those words to anybody before, not in her nearly forty years of life - not like this, anyway. They left her a little breathless, her lungs struggling to take in air as she waited for Agatha’s response. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha just gazed at her for a long moment, her blue eyes searching Rio’s, and Rio left her gaze open, allowing Agatha to see the truth in her expression. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then a smile cracked over Agatha’s face and she leaned in, pressing her lips to Rio’s in an impossibly soft and emotional kiss, her fingers tightening in Rio’s grasp as leaned in closely. Rio’s entire body felt lighter, like Agatha was the only one holding her down to Earth, but she welcomed it, whole-heartedly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Agatha pulled away, she pressed her forehead to Rio’s. “God help me,” she whispered, in the space between their lips, “but I love you, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a happy sound as she pressed her lips back against Agatha’s, turning her onto her back as she straddled her hips, pressing their bodies as closely together as physically possible. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Make love to me then.”</span>
