<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha stopped mid sentence, looking between Nicky and Rio in confusion. “Nicky, how do you know Rio?”</p><p>Nicky, completely unaware of any extra awkwardness, answered. “She’s my birth-mother.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened as she looked between them again, and Rio knew what she was seeing— the same face shape, the same nose and cheeks and smile, the same eyes. Rio didn’t need a DNA test or paperwork to prove what she could easily see with her own eyes, and she could tell that Agatha didn’t either.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio said finally, though the greeting felt extremely inadequate as soon as it left her lips. But there wasn’t exactly a guidebook to this whole awkward situation.</p><p>What exactly do you say when the adoptive mother of your biological son is also the woman you fucked last Friday?</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio stood at the front of the lecture hall, watching as the gathered students packed up their belongings.</p><p>“Don’t forget your midterm exam is next week,” she reminded them. “We’ll be reviewing your study guide in class on Thursday, so make sure it’s finished, and post the outline for your essay to the online discussion board. Have a great rest of the day.”</p><p>Rio disconnected her laptop from the projector as the students filed out, shoving it and her notebook into her bag before making her way down the hall to her office. It was a small room, like most of the teacher assistants’ offices, just large enough for Rio’s tiny desk and all of her instruments. Her desk, a modern metal monstrosity, was covered with copies of sheet music and worksheets she had yet to grade. The walls were lined with bookshelves packed with textbooks and repertoire collections. Every empty surface held some sort of plant, a collection Rio had started herself but had grown over the last couple of years with gifts from students and professors alike. The majority of the space was taken up by instruments. A large string-bass was tucked away in the corner, and one wall was entirely covered with instruments, all hung neatly in their places. There was a violin and viola, both acoustic and electric guitars, an electric bass, as well as two different sizes of ukulele. Rio’s cello, her main instrument, sat on a music stand close to her desk.</p><p>Rio placed her bag beside her desk, before rolling her chair out of the way so she could reach her mini-fridge. She had spent her lunch hour grading essays, but she had a little time now that she could eat before heading to the practice rooms where she held private lessons. Then, with some luck, she’d have some time to get into the recording studio to work on her own project. She was in the final year of her doctoral project, and she was bound and determined to finish and defend her dissertation by the end of the spring semester.</p><p>A knock on the door pulled Rio’s attention away from her salad.</p><p>“My office hours are on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and if you have any pressing questions you can email me,” Rio called, but there was another knock. Rio sighed and sat her salad on her desk, atop a tenuously-balanced stack of papers, before going to open the door. At first glance, the hallway was completely empty— then Rio looked down.</p><p>“Hello!”</p><p>The boy in the hall was young, far too young to be on a college campus. He was wearing a school uniform— a wrinkled white button up, khaki pants, and a navy blazer that looked a bit too big for him. His brown hair was long, pulled into a messy ponytail at the nape of his neck. A smattering of freckles dotted his nose and his eyes—</p><p>
<em> Oh… </em>
</p><p>“Can I help you?” Rio asked, swallowing down the butterflies that filled her stomach at seeing chocolate brown eyes that made her feel like she was looking in a mirror.</p><p>“Are you Rosario Vidal?” the boy asked.</p><p>“Yes, but I go by Rio,” she replied. “And who are you?”</p><p>The boy’s smile spread even wider. “My name’s Nicholas. I’m your son.”</p><p>Without a moment’s hesitation, the boy— Nicholas— threw his arms around her waist and squeezed her tight. Rio stood frozen, one arm still holding the door open, heart in her throat at the boy’s words.</p><p>
<em> I’m your son. </em>
</p><p>Rio’s hesitation didn’t appear to slow the boy down. He released her just as quickly as he had hugged her, squeezing past her into the office. Her hands shook as she turned around, closing the door behind her. Nicholas was peering with unrestrained curiosity at the instruments on her wall, though he kept his hands clasped cautiously at his sides.</p><p>“These are so cool,” he said, looking at the Gibson Les Paul on the wall.</p><p>Rio, however, was still in shock. “I’m sorry, did you say you’re my <em> son?” </em></p><p>Nicholas turned and leveled her with a bored expression. “You had a baby nine years ago, on June third twenty-fourteen, a baby boy. And you gave him up for adoption the next day, didn’t you?”</p><p>Rio swallowed. “I did.”</p><p>Nicholas smiled again. “That’s me.”</p><p>Rio stepped forward, reaching for his face. Nicholas stood still, letting her cup his cheeks. Rio’s eyes traced over his features, searching for and finding so many of her own looking back at her, until her vision blurred. She released his face, reaching up to wipe her eyes, before looking back at him.</p><p>“Hi,” he said, his voice gentle, like somehow in his nine-year-old wisdom he knew how fragile Rio felt in this moment.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio said, finally allowing a smile to spread across her own face.</p><p>Nicholas grinned and went back to peering at the instruments. “Can you play all of these?”</p><p>“Some better than others,” Rio replied automatically. “How did you find me?”</p><p>“The Google,” he said simply, reaching out to carefully run his fingers along the mother of pearl inlay on her twelve-string. “I found my adoption paperwork in Mama’s office, and it had your name on it, so I googled it.”</p><p>That made sense. Nine years ago, when Rio had made the most difficult decision of her life, she had elected for the adoption to be mostly closed, but she had wanted the adoptive parents to have her name, just in case they needed it for medical purposes, or if her child wanted to reach out to her when they got older. She hadn’t expected it so soon, and definitely not like this, but—</p><p>“Is your mama here with you?” Rio asked, looking toward the closed door.</p><p>Nicholas’s expression instantly morphed from curious to sheepish. His eyes darted toward Rio, then to the door. “No…”</p><p>Rio blinked, confused. “So, your dad—?”</p><p>“I don’t have a dad,” Nicholas said, voice confident once again. “It’s just me and Mama.”</p><p>“But your mama didn’t bring you?” Rio clarified. Nicholas didn’t answer, just continued to avoid eye contact. “Nicholas, how did you get here?”</p><p>“I took the bus,” he replied proudly. He hopped into one of the chairs beside Rio’s desk, his feet dangling above the floor as he kicked his feet. “And you can call me Nicky, that’s what Mama calls me.”</p><p>“Nicky—” Rio began.</p><p>“Do you have any snacks?” he asked, looking at her salad with curiosity before his nose wrinkled in disgust.</p><p>“I probably have some granola bars somewhere,” Rio replied, opening her desk drawer and digging around inside. “But Nicky—”</p><p>“Are you a teacher?” he asked, clearly trying to avoid her question.</p><p>Rio stopped digging for snacks as she realized what he was trying to do. She looked at him across the desk, schooling her features into her best teacher face.</p><p><em> “Nicholas,” </em>she said, her voice brooking no argument, “does your mama know that you’re here?”</p><p>He didn’t have to reply to her question; the way he avoided eye contact was answer enough. It was a tactic Rio had used often enough in her own life, so she recognized the avoidance instantly.</p><p>“She doesn’t know, does she?” Rio pushed, heart hammering in her chest. <em> Oh, god, this kid— </em></p><p>“I just wanted to meet you,” Nicky said, looking at her with big brown eyes and a pouting lip and—</p><p>
<em> Okay, that just wasn’t fair at all. </em>
</p><p><em> “Fu—dge!” </em> Rio exclaimed, censoring herself last minute as she ran her fingers through her head in exasperation. “Okay, we gotta get you home. Do you have a phone?”</p><p>“Yeah, but it died while I was playing Block Blast on the bus,” he explained. “When I got home from school, I went to the bus stop and took the M103 to get here. I had to wait at the bus stop for <em> forever </em>, and the bus ride was super long. I beat like ten levels of Block Blast.”</p><p>He shrugged like it wasn’t a big deal. Rio just stared at him, not sure if she was more appalled or impressed at his sneakiness.</p><p>“Well, we need to contact your mom,” Rio told him. “Do you know her number?”</p><p>Nicky shook his head and Rio sighed. Kids these days could track down random people on the internet and navigate bus routes, but they didn’t memorize phone numbers anymore.</p><p>“Do you at least know your address?” Rio asked.</p><p>He nodded proudly before spouting off an address on Fifth Avenue.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. Of course the baby she gave up for adoption when she lived in a completely different state now lived in the same city as her. And, based on his address, whoever had adopted him was <em> very </em> well off.</p><p>“Okay, well, we need to get you home,” she said. “I’m sure your mama is worried sick about you.”</p><p>Nicky looked at the clock on the wall. “Nah, she’s not home from work for another hour.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, imagine how worried she’ll be when she gets home and you’re not there.”</p><p>Nicky’s eyes widened, as if the reality of what he had done had just now hit him. “Oh…”</p><p>“Yeah, <em> oh </em>,” Rio said, quickly sending a email cancelling her afternoon lessons before grabbing her things. She took one look at the now-wilted salad on her desk and tossed it into the trashcan by her door. “If we get you home quick, maybe she won’t accuse me of kidnapping.”</p><p>“You can’t kidnap me, you’re my mom,” Nicky said, confused.</p><p>Rio’s heart lurched at his words. She looked at him and sighed.</p><p>“I’m not your mom, kiddo,” she said softly. “I’m your birth mother. I gave up any right to you nine years ago.”</p><p>Nicky’s brow wrinkled in confusion. “So… What do I call you?”</p><p>“You can just call me Rio,” she told him as she draped her coat over her arm. “Come on, let’s go. We can pick up something to eat on the way.”</p><p>The little boy’s face lit up. “Like McDonald’s?”</p><p>Rio chuckled, thankful for a child’s short attention span. “McDonald’s it is. <em> Vamanos, </em>let’s go.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>One Happy Meal later and they were on the subway, heading toward the Upper East Side. Rio chose a seat away from the other riders, and Nicky sat close beside her. She kept glancing toward him as she ate her chicken sandwich, watching as Nicky ate his burger with one hand while holding his Mario-themed toy in the other. He seemed tired now that he was getting his belly full and sitting still, but that wasn’t much of a surprise; he had gone on quite an adventure today, even if it was in the same city, and she imagined the adrenaline rush and subsequent fade was probably hitting him hard.</p><p>“You okay over there, kiddo?” she asked.</p><p>“Yeah,” Nicky said, sitting back in the seat. He took another bite of his burger. “Cahn I ashk you shumthin?”</p><p>“If you’ll chew your food first, yeah,” Rio replied with a grin.</p><p>Nicky paused to finish his bite, then looked at her. “Why didn’t you keep me?”</p><p>Rio stared at her lap, contemplating her answer. It wasn’t that she hadn’t expected the question, in his shoes she would’ve wanted the answer, too, and it would’ve been one of the first things she asked. She knew it was coming, had known it was coming for the past nine years. The problem was, she still wasn’t sure how to explain something so complicated in a way that a kid would understand it.</p><p>“There were… a lot of reasons,” she said finally. “I was young, I was dumb, and I wasn’t ready to be a mother. I wanted you to have a better life than I could give you.”</p><p>It was a basic, generic answer and Rio could tell by the look on Nicky’s face that even at nine years old he knew it.</p><p>“Any more questions?” Rio asked, trying to press on to a different subject.</p><p>“Do I have a dad?”</p><p>
<em> Fuuuuuuuuck. </em>
</p><p>Rio grabbed her Dr. Pepper and took a long swig, delaying. Finally she put it back in between her feet.</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>Nicky looked at her in confusion. “I thought—”</p><p>“I made you all by myself, kiddo,” Rio told him. “Next question.”</p><p>Nicky frowned, but he had the good sense not to press. He looked out the window in thought for a moment.</p><p>“Do I have grandparents?” he asked. “Or aunts and uncles?”</p><p>“I was an only child, so no aunts or uncles,” she told him. “And your grandparents, my mom and dad, died in a car accident about two years before you were born.”</p><p>“Oh,” he said, his voice sad. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twisted at the sincerity in his voice. “Yeah, me too. You would’ve liked them. And they would’ve adored you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t tell him the complicated part. How he might not be here if her parents hadn’t died in that accident. How their deaths sent her down a path of self-destructive choices that ultimately ended when she got pregnant and started putting her life together. How if they had been alive and she had gotten pregnant there would’ve been no way in hell she would’ve given him up for adoption because she would’ve actually had a support system to help her. It’s a giant spiral of what-ifs and could’ve beens, and Rio had spent years going down those mental rabbit holes. Therapy had helped, but sometimes she would still get caught up in it. Seeing Nicky here, now, in the flesh, brought it all back up to the surface.</p><p>“Tell me about your family,” Rio said, as they came to their stop. They quickly collected their trash and Rio shepherded him toward the subway doors, keeping a hand firmly on his shoulder so they didn’t get separated in the crowd of people.</p><p>“Like what?” Nicky asked, looking up at her as they got off the subway and headed toward the next train.</p><p>“Well, what about your mama? What’s she like?”</p><p>“She’s awesome,” Nicky replied simply.</p><p>“Oh yeah?” Rio smiled, reassured. “What’s so awesome about her?”</p><p>“She’s super smart,” he told her. “She reads <em> a lot </em> and she helps me with my homework and she always knows all the answers. She can sing really pretty, even though she doesn’t think she sounds good. Some of my friends think she’s mean, but that’s just because she has this serious face when she’s looking at her phone or working. And she’s really funny, but sometimes people don’t get her jokes.”</p><p>“She sounds like super-mom,” Rio said. Her heart was doing this weird twisty-thing in her chest. Nicholas’s words and the fondness in his tone affirmed that he had a good home, a good mother who loved him and he loved in return, but it was still a bittersweet feeling.</p><p>“She has a superpower,” Nicky said, tugging on her sleeve, his voice dropping to just a whisper. “You know what it is?”</p><p>“What?” Rio asked conspiratorially, leaning down to hear him.</p><p>“She can always find stuff I’ve lost,” Nicky said with absolute certainty. “It’s like magic.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “And do you lose things a lot?”</p><p>Nicky frowned. “I don’t mean to. Mama says I need to be more organized, but I forget where I put things. And sometimes I swear I put things where they belong but when I need them, they’re not there.”</p><p>“Same, kid,” Rio grimaced. “Sorry you inherited that from me. Didn’t think things like that were genetic, but what do I know.”</p><p>“What does genetic mean?” Nicky asked as they boarded the next train.</p><p>“It’s something that’s passed down from parent to child,” Rio explained.</p><p>“Oh, so I’m messy like you but I like to read like Mama,” Nicky summarized.</p><p>“Something like that,” Rio said. “And just so you know, I like to read, too.”</p><p>“Cool,” Nicky grinned. “Have you ever read Percy Jackson?”</p><p>“I’ve heard of it, but I’ve never read it,” Rio told him.</p><p>“Lilia gave me a copy of the first book. It’s soooooo good,” Nicky said excitedly. “Do you know the story of Perseus? It’s based on that, kinda, but it’s about a boy named Percy and…”</p><p>Rio listened as he went on and on about the book. She recognized the names of several Greek gods, interspersed with something about a summer camp. His retelling was sporadic, at best, but Rio did her best to follow it as they continued on into uptown, finally coming to the stop near where Nicky lived.</p><p>She swallowed down a lump in her throat as they got off the subway and started walking to their destination. She kept glancing at the boy beside her, memorizing his features. Her mind kept flashing back to when she had done this before, how she had stared at the baby in her arms for hours, trying to picture what he would look like as he grew. Now she knew, or at least had an idea.</p><p>She could do this. She had done it before.</p><p>It felt like her heart had taken up residence in her throat as they came to a statuesque apartment building. A doorman stood by the entrance, and Nicky waved to the man as he approached the doorway. Rio, however, was frozen. Did she follow him? Did she get to see even more of his life? Did she just drop him off and pretend this never happened?</p><p>Nicky turned and looked at her with confusion. “Are you coming?”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Rio replied, and by the time her brain caught up with her actions, they were in the elevator.</p><p>“I don’t think Mama’s home yet,” Nicky said as they made their way from the elevator to the door of the apartment. “Normally I stay with my friends Billy and Tommy after school, but they both had doctor’s appointments today and I convinced Mama that I could stay by myself for a few hours.”</p><p>Rio blinked as he turned on the lights and his words fully processed in her brain. “Nicky, how long have you been planning this little adventure?”</p><p>Nicky shrugged. “Like a week maybe.”</p><p>Once again Rio was equal parts amused and absolutely aghast at the boy’s actions. He was too damn smart for his own good.</p><p>Nicky dropped his bookbag in the foyer, at the bottom of a staircase. The interior of the apartment was a mixture of vintage and modern. Rich exposed wooden beams and built-ins contrasted with earthy green tones. The decor was eclectic, and Rio got the feeling that every painting, knick-knack and vase had been obtained and placed with a purpose.</p><p>“Do you wanna see my room?” Nicky asked.</p><p>“Yeah, sure.” Rio followed him up the stairs, across a narrow hallway, to his bedroom.</p><p>Rio wasn’t exactly familiar with normal kids’ bedrooms, but she was fairly certain Nicky’s was unique, though it fit with the ambiance of the rest of the apartment. The walls were covered in a dark wallpaper with a golden constellation print, and decorated with framed vintage prints. A twin bed sat in the center of the room, a blue and orange quilt thrown haphazardly over an absurd number of pillows. The nightstand on one side of the bed had a lamp and a small collection of cups that looked to be fostering an unintentional science project, while the other held a stack of books that looked one breath away from toppling over. The dresser to Rio’s right held several trophies— basketball, baseball, and one with a music note. Several drawers were half-open, and a pile of dirty clothes sat on the floor directly beside an empty basket. The closet door was wide open, and while the clothes were all hung up neatly and arranged by color, the shoes were in a heap on the floor beside a baseball bat bag and bicycle helmet. In front of the window was a desk, the top strewn with papers, some old worksheets and some drawings that showed real talent for a kid Nicky’s age, at least in Rio’s untrained and slightly biased opinion.</p><p>“I, uh… I haven’t cleaned in a while,” Nicky said, looking sheepish.</p><p>“It’s fine,” Rio assured him, looking at a collection of plaques hung near his desk. One was for singing in a local children’s honor choir, another was for most-improved catcher in baseball, and the last was for most free-throws made in a basketball contest. “You like sports?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Nicky said, his chest puffing up proudly. “I play baseball and basketball. I tried soccer this year because my friends Billy and Tommy play. I want to play football, but Mama says no because of all the head injuries.”</p><p>“Smart Mama,” Rio agreed.</p><p>The sound of the apartment door opening downstairs pulled Rio’s attention away from Nicky’s trophy collection. She looked at the boy, and he looked back at her with wide eyes.</p><p>“Mama’s home,” he said, and Rio could see the full realization of the situation hitting him in real time.</p><p>“Hey, it’s gonna be okay,” she reassured him, although her own anxiety was buzzing in her chest.</p><p>A voice called out from downstairs, “Nicky? You awake up there, buddy?”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught in her throat. <em>She knew that voice.</em></p><p>“Yes, Mama,” Nicky said, grabbing Rio’s hand and pulling her behind him. They twisted down the stairs, through the living and dining rooms, and into a small kitchen at the back of the apartment. Grocery bags were on the counter, and Nicky’s mother was bent over putting food away in the fridge.</p><p>“You didn’t answer your phone when I called to ask what you wanted for dinner, so I got one of those frozen stir-fry things you—” The woman stood up and her bright blue eyes went to Nicky and then immediately to Rio standing behind him. “What the hell are you doing here?”</p><p>Rio couldn’t breathe. This wasn’t happening, <em> couldn’t </em> be happening.</p><p>Before Rio or Nicky could answer, she reached for Nicky, tugging him away from Rio, but he kept his hand wrapped tightly around hers, leading to a rather awkward tug of war.</p><p>“It’s okay, Mama,” Nicky said. “This is Rio.”</p><p>“I know th—” Agatha stopped mid sentence, looking between Nicky and Rio in confusion. “Nicky, how do you know Rio?”</p><p>Nicky, completely unaware of any extra awkwardness, answered. “She’s my birth-mother.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened as she looked between them again, and Rio knew what she was seeing— the same face shape, the same nose and cheeks and smile, the same eyes. Rio didn’t need a DNA test or paperwork to prove what she could easily see with her own eyes, and she could tell that Agatha didn’t either.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio said finally, though the greeting felt extremely inadequate as soon as it left her lips. But there wasn’t exactly a guidebook to this whole awkward situation.</p><p>
<em> What exactly do you say when the adoptive mother of your biological son is also the woman you fucked last Friday? </em>
</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha said, staring at Rio for a long moment. “How?”</p><p>“Well—” Rio began, looking at Nicky.</p><p>Nicky let go of Rio’s hand to reach for Agatha’s. “I went to see her.”</p><p>Agatha finally looked away from Rio to look at Nicky. “What?”</p><p>“I found the file in your office, and I googled her name,” Nicky explained. “Rio’s studying at NYU, so I took the bus there after school today.”</p><p>“You… took the bus?” Agatha repeated. She looked from Nicky to Rio, who just shrugged.</p><p>“Surprised me, too,” Rio told her.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha said again, slumping against the cabinets.</p><p>“Are you mad?” Nicky asked.</p><p>“That’s one of the things I’m feeling, for sure,” Agatha said, voice firm. “And when I get over everything else, you and I are going to have a very long talk about safety and doing all this without talking to me about it. But for right now, I need you to go to my room so Rio and I can talk like grown ups. Can you do that for me?”</p><p>“Yes,” Nicky sighed. He turned toward Rio and threw himself at her, wrapping his arms around her waist. This time Rio didn’t hesitate; she put her arms around his shoulders and hugged him back, letting his warmth soak into her for a long moment before he pulled away.</p><p>“It was nice to meet you, Nicky,” she said finally, reaching up to tousle his hair.</p><p>“You too,” he said, his eyes damp as he looked at her. He shook his head and hurried past her, and Rio watched as he disappeared around the corner.</p><p>Rio’s heart ached as soon as he was out of her sight. She swallowed hard against the tears that threatened to fall, collecting herself for a moment before turning back to Agatha.</p><p>
<em> Agatha. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Nicky’s mother. </em>
</p><p>Rio knew Fate had a sense of humor but holy hell if this didn’t take the fucking cake.</p><p>Agatha watched her with a wary gaze. She looked different than the night they had met— her makeup was sharper, her hair was up in a neat bun, and she wore a black high-necked blouse and gray slacks. Rio wondered for a moment if she was wearing a high collar because the bite marks Rio had left were still visible.</p><p><em>Nope, nope, nope</em>, that was a <em>very</em> dangerous train of thought, and Rio was getting off that ride right now.</p><p>“Small world, huh?” Rio asked, shoving her hands in her pockets.</p><p>Agatha barked out a laugh at that. “That might be the understatement of the century.” She studied Rio for a long moment. “I can’t believe I didn’t see it. You two look so much alike.”</p><p>“Well it’s not like you were looking for similarities at the time,” Rio said quickly. “We were doing, uh… other things…”</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure whose blush was brighter, hers or Agatha’s. <em> Smooth, Vidal, real smooth. </em></p><p>“Yes, well, that clearly can’t happen again,” Agatha said, shaking her head.</p><p>Rio couldn’t help the bitter disappointment that filled her at Agatha’s words, even though she knew it was definitely true. This was already complicated enough, obviously more sex was off the table.</p><p>“Right,” Rio nodded in agreement. “Let’s just… start over. Pretend Friday never happened.”</p><p>As if Rio could forget. But Agatha nodded vigorously in agreement, so that was that.</p><p>“The adoption file said <em> Rosario Vidal? </em>” Agatha asked, succinctly changing subjects.</p><p>“Yeah, that’s my full name,” Rio replied. “Rosario… Rio…”</p><p>“Right,” Agatha nodded.</p><p>A tense silence rose between them again, making Rio squirm.</p><p>“I’m sorry to surprise you like this, I know it has to be a shock,” Rio said finally, speaking quickly. “But when he showed up at my office, I wasn’t about to let him ride the bus back by himself.”</p><p>The tension seemed to seep out of Agatha’s shoulders as she leaned back against the cabinet. “Thank you for that. I’ve tried to teach him independence but sometimes I think I’ve done my job too well. He thinks he can do things by himself without any adult supervision, but he doesn’t always realize how dangerous it could be. We’re lucky you’re not a serial killer.”</p><p>“Not a serial killer, I promise,” Rio told her, raising her hands innocently.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze immediately went to Rio’s hands, eyes wide, and Rio tucked them back into her pockets. Agatha studied her for another long moment, her expression turning serious, before gesturing vaguely. “Is this going to be… an issue?”</p><p>Rio frowned, processing her words. She shook her head. “No, of course not. You’re his mother, I know that.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha said. “And his father?”</p><p>“He doesn’t have one,” Rio replied quickly. When Agatha raised her brow, Rio realized that answer wouldn’t work on an adult like it had on Nicky, and she sighed. “Well, obviously, there was a man who contributed DNA, but… he’s not an issue. I’m not even sure who he is, to be honest.”</p><p>“Understood,” Agatha nodded, frowning.</p><p>“I’m not… I mean…” Rio shifted her weight from one foot to the other. “I don’t do that kind of thing… anymore.”</p><p>“Do what kind of thing?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Hook up with random people that I don’t know,” Rio told her. “Or, um, I didn’t…”</p><p><em> Until you. </em>Rio didn’t know why she even felt the need to explain herself to someone who was little more than a stranger. And besides, Agatha didn’t have any room to judge her. She had been just as active a participant the other night as Rio.</p><p>Rio raised her chin defiantly. She wasn’t particularly proud of the period in her life when Nicky was conceived, but she didn’t want anyone else judging her for something that had happened years ago. And she certainly wasn’t ashamed of what had happened between her and Agatha.</p><p>It just couldn’t ever happen again.</p><p>“I guess I should go,” Rio said finally. “You have dinner to cook, a son to discipline…”</p><p>“Mmm, not looking forward to that,” Agatha sighed. “I’ll walk you out.”</p><p>Agatha stepped by her, and Rio followed her through the dining room to the front door, but she froze in the living room as her attention was drawn to a series of photos on the wall. It was like a timeline of Nicky’s life, each frame offering a glimpse of his childhood thus far. Rio had missed them when she came through the room the first time, but now she couldn’t pull herself away.</p><p>The most recent photo showed Nicky in a soccer uniform, beside two other boys around the same age. Next was a photo of Nicky in a crowd of other kids, singing on stage. There was a picture of Nicky on his first day of kindergarten, wearing a wide smile and holding a Spiderman backpack. There were more photos of birthday parties and Christmases and Halloweens. Sometimes Agatha was in the pictures, sometimes other children— the two boys from the soccer photo were frequently included. In each one Nicky looked happy, he looked healthy…</p><p>
<em> He looked loved. </em>
</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>She heard Agatha’s voice, but her attention was entirely on the first photo of the montage. Rio reached out a shaking hand and ran her fingers against the glass, her breath frozen in her throat.</p><p>The picture showed Nicky exactly as he had been the day she gave him up; she recognized the green onesie as one she had purchased and dressed him in before handing him over to the social worker for the last time. Upon further inspection, Rio even recognized the pale peach and teal walls as a hospital room in the hospital she had given birth in.</p><p>
<em> It was the day he was adopted. </em>
</p><p>The Agatha in the picture was younger. Her thick brown hair fell in waves around her shoulders and she had bangs that were almost in her eyes. It was her eyes, piercing blue even in the sun-faded photo, that made her glow. Those eyes were damp with tears and fully focused on the tiny baby in her arms.</p><p>The image made something in the depths of Rio’s soul settle for the first time in over nine years.</p><p>
<em> She loved him so much. </em>
</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Rio sniffled and reached up to wipe away tears she hadn’t realized falling from her eyes. She turned to where Agatha stood by the door, watching her with concern.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m fine,” Rio replied, wiping her eyes as she stepped past Agatha and into the foyer. As Agatha stepped around her and opened the door, Rio suddenly felt frantic. She reached into her bag and dug around frantically. She managed to find a pen, but she couldn’t find a notepad. Instead she ripped the back page out of a book of sheet music— surely she wouldn’t need that particular page— and wrote her name, phone number, and personal email address. Then she looked up at Agatha.</p><p>“I would’ve gotten you a piece of paper, you know,” Agatha said, pursing her lips, but Rio ignored her.</p><p>“Here,” she said, holding the paper toward the other woman. “That’s my contact information. I’m not… I don’t want to be an <em> issue </em>, I don’t want to disrupt whatever you two have. I just… I want you to have it in case you ever need anything, you know?”</p><p>Agatha looked from Rio to the paper for a long moment before she finally took it. “Okay.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Thank you. That’s… Thank you.”</p><p>Agatha still looked nervous, so Rio took a step back, giving her space.</p><p>“Tell Nicky that I said goodbye?”</p><p>“I will,” Agatha assured her. “Goodbye, Rio.”</p><p>“Goodbye,” Rio said, still a bit breathless as Agatha closed the door. She stared at the wooden door for another long moment before nodding and heading to the elevator.</p><p>She rode home in a blur, somehow navigating the Manhattan streets and subway to arrive safely at her building. As Rio entered her tiny apartment, she kicked off her shoes and discarded her belongings in the living room before going down the hall to her bedroom. She slid open the door to her closet and peered up at the cluttered shelf over her head. Tucked in the corner, beside the Halloween and Christmas decorations, was a box that she hadn’t touched since she moved in five years earlier. Rio carefully extracted it from the corner and carried it to her bed.</p><p>Rio sighed as she sat in the center of her mattress. It was times like this that she really missed drinking.</p><p>She opened the box carefully, holding her breath to avoid the dust cloud that rose from the top. Inside was a manila envelope full of documents that she set aside. Under the envelope was a wide assortment of memorabilia— ticket stubs from sporting events and Broadway shows, wristbands from music festivals, a random assortment of guitar picks, old napkins from what had to be half the bars in south Florida. In one corner, however, was a smaller envelope, packed with photos, and this was what Rio was looking for.</p><p>She flipped through the photos, thankful that these were from a time when people still printed their photos. She ignored the photos of the band, the crowds, her eyes searching for two specific images.</p><p>Her breath caught in her throat when she found it. Rio barely recognized the woman in the photo— ten years younger, with shorter hair and even heavier eyeliner than she wore now. In the picture, she was wearing a blue striped t-shirt and burgundy sweatpants because they were the only thing that had fit her at the time and she had refused to wear maternity clothes.</p><p>She was seven months along in the photo.</p><p>Rio had been fiercely against having her picture taken while she was pregnant. She hadn’t wanted any evidence of the event, any reminders. Alice had sneakily taken this one. Rio didn’t know the photo existed until months after she gave birth, and even then she had tucked it away, unable to bring herself to look at it for a long time. Even now she kept it out of sight, out of mind.</p><p>The girl in the photo wasn’t happy, Rio knew that. She was lost, and Rio thought if she stared at her brown eyes long enough she could see it. But in that moment, that small snapshot, she had been smiling, her hands on her stomach, a look of awe on her face. The baby had kicked, and it just so happened that her bestfriend had caught the exact moment on film.</p><p>Rio swallowed down her emotions as she moved to the next photo, fully aware of what it showed.</p><p>The peach and teal hospital walls. Rio dressed in a Guns n' Roses t-shirt and borrowed scrub pants because her own pants had been drenched in amniotic fluid the day before. The baby in her arms, dressed in the little green onesie that Rio had bought just for that moment.</p><p>The moment she gave him up.</p><p>Alice had taken this photo, too. She had insisted that Rio would want something to remember the day by, even if it was much later. There had been other photos— posed ones, of Rio holding the baby up awkwardly to face the camera— but she had shredded those as soon as she got them. But this one— Rio had kept this one.</p><p>It was a profile shot. Rio had the baby on her lap, cradling his tiny head between her hands, and she was staring down into his eyes intently. Rio remembered that moment as well— she had been trying to memorize his every feature, trying to imagine how he would grow, the person he would become as he grew, the person she never expected to meet.</p><p>She didn’t have to imagine now.</p><p>Rio traced her fingers over the photo for the hundredth time, but this time her mind was imaging the face of a little boy instead of a baby.</p><p>

<p>
<b>Last Friday</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hurry up, we’re gonna be late!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio picked up her cello and followed Alice through the ornate hallway of the venue. If she wasn’t already out of breath, she would’ve reminded her friend that she didn’t even want to be there and she could just go home and leave Alice to play the gig by herself, thank you very much. Instead she followed Alice through the Gilded Age mansion-turned-event center until they came to a large ballroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As far as gigs went, this one was definitely nicer than most— and Rio already knew it paid better— a gala for a fashion magazine. The ballroom was massive, and every surface glittered with excess. Towering marble columns framed the vast space, while an intricate fresco of Apollo in his chariot sprawled across the domed ceiling. Massive crystal chandeliers hung on either end of the room, casting a warm glow around the space. Beneath them, a parquet floor gleamed, the hardwood polished so spotlessly that Rio thought she might see her reflection if she looked hard enough. Small tables were positioned around the edges of the room, each one set with an elaborate floral centerpiece surrounded by crystal place settings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The piano’s in the far corner, come on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room was bustling with venue employees hurrying to put last minute touches in place. Alice, unencumbered by carrying a massive string instrument, maneuvered through the crowd with no problem. Rio, however, was not so lucky. After dodging a cook carrying a hot dish near the buffet table, she narrowly avoided knocking over a man carrying a tray of crystal champagne flutes. As she twisted around, her cello case caught against someone’s legs and Rio bit down a curse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sh— Sorry, I’m so—” Rio’s breath caught in her throat as she turned to see who she had bumped into. The woman was gorgeous, in a billowing purple silk gown with a plunging neckline that dipped almost to the waist, revealing an expanse of pale skin and the curve of soft breasts that Rio couldn’t help but be drawn to. The dress was cinched at the waist with a gold belt, accentuating the woman’s hourglass figure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gulped as she forced her gaze upward, and the woman’s face was just as stunning as the rest of her— sharp features, high cheekbones, plush red lips, and the brightest blue eyes Rio had ever seen. Her brown hair fell in neat, soft curls halfway to her waist, and Rio wanted to bury her hands in it—</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Whoa, hold on a minute.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The woman raised a brow and Rio realized she was still staring, jaw practically on the floor. She stuttered out another apology before hurrying past the beautiful woman toward where Alice was setting up for their performance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Woooooow,” Alice said softly as Rio caught up and started removing her cello from the case.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t even,” Rio warned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was the worst case of gay panic I think I’ve ever seen,” Alice continued, ignoring her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh please, like I haven’t helped you pick your jaw up off the floor over a pretty woman before,” Rio teased. “Remember Kim? Francine? </span>
<em>
<span>Lola?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, yeah, I get it,” Alice huffed. “We’re both disasters.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just as long as we’re on this sinking ship together, baby,” Rio chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The ballroom filled with elegantly-dressed people, milling around in their tuxes and elegant gowns. Waiters in crisp white jackets flitted through the crowd, their trays laden with delicate hors d’oeuvres and flutes of champagne. The air buzzed with low conversations, and here and there an attendee might stop to momentarily observe their performance, but she and Alice were largely ignored, simply enjoyed in the background.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There had been a time in her life when Rio would’ve hated gigs like this. A younger Rio had longed for the limelight, to have every eye in the room on her, and she had soaked it all in. Now, though, she found gigs like this to be her favorite. She didn’t have to put on a show, but rather she could let herself get lost in the music, in the way her muscles moved beneath her blazer, the resistance as she moved the bow across the strings, in the vibrations that only she could feel reverberating through her body. The host had requested </span>
<em>
<span>Bridgerton-esque</span>
</em>
<span>, so she and Alice played everything from Bach to Beyonce.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knew nearly all the pieces by heart, so as she played her eyes often wandered around the ballroom, her attention drawn by a burst of laughter or the glitz of jewelry. More often than not, Rio found her eyes drawn to a distinct flash of purple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman in purple was someone important, Rio deduced. She was clearly making her rounds, speaking to every guest in turn, her bright blue eyes sparkling with each conversation. Her hands were constantly moving, Rio noticed, and were a clear indicator of the quality of her conversations; gesticulating wildly and offering gentle touches when the conversation was stimulating, twisting in her skirt or around the stem of her glass when the conversation was dull or uncomfortable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>An hour or so into the evening, as the cadence to a Vivaldi piece settled in the air, Rio felt eyes on her. She didn’t look up, although every fiber of her being wanted to, instead focusing on the sheet music on her stand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, let’s do the Hozier cover,” Rio said, flipping ahead in her binder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seriously?” Alice huffed, then added under her breath, “God, you’re so gay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ignored her, finding the page in her music— though she didn’t really need it. She risked glancing up, and sure enough her eyes landed on familiar purple silk. The woman was leaning against a nearby column, beside another woman in a pale pink chiffon dress. Rio frowned as the woman in pink leaned in and whispered something that made the brunette laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You ready?” Alice asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One second,” Rio replied, laying her cello down. She quickly shrugged her blazer off and placed it on the back of her chair. Underneath she wore a sheer cream-colored blouse, the sleeves of which Rio neatly rolled up to her elbows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t even know if she’s into women,” Alice whispered as Rio picked up her instrument.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced back up toward the woman in purple and her eyes met bright blue. Rio’s arms flexed as she held her bow, and the woman’s lips parted slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Definitely gay,” Rio murmured, but her words were drowned out by the first few notes on the piano. Apparently Alice was done humoring her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio loved playing this song, partially because of the song itself, but mostly because of how physical the playing was. Alice took the melody for the verses, with Rio playing long sustained bass notes, but once the chorus came in, Rio took over the melody, playing fiercely. Finally came the bridge, which they slowed down and softened, and Rio could lean into the vibrato. When they finally reached the final chorus, Rio switched to playing pizzicato, and as she played she couldn’t help but glance up. Bright blue eyes met hers, and Rio didn’t look away as she continued plucking the strings.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Offer me that deathless death, indeed.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio only looked away as she placed her bow back on the strings, finishing the last chorus with a flourish. As the final note rang out, she grinned at Alice and then looked back toward the marble column.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed down her disappointment, looking around briefly before Alice tapped her on the shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re gonna give some speeches, and we get a break to eat dinner. Come on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They loaded up their plates at the buffet and sat at the table closest to their instruments. Rio looked across the room to where a small podium stood beneath a banner reading </span>
<em>
<span>Tarot </span>
</em>
<span>in bright gold letters as the first speaker took her place to speak, and was surprised to see the woman in the pink chiffon dress from earlier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello, everyone,” she said into a small microphone. “For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Jennifer Kale, </span>
<em>
<span>Tarot’s </span>
</em>
<span>creative director. This year has been an especially exciting time for our creative team, orchestrating a series of projects with a variety of designers…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tuned out the woman’s words as she ate, uninterested in the sales statistics of a fashion magazine. She had heard of </span>
<em>
<span>Tarot</span>
</em>
<span>, in the sense that she had seen copies while she waited in line at the grocery store. It wasn’t </span>
<em>
<span>Vogue, </span>
</em>
<span>but she imagined that for some people it was a big deal. Personally, Rio was far more interested in her dinner. She took a bite of the meat on her plate and let out a soft moan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, this is good, did you get the…” Her voice trailed off as she looked up at Alice. The other woman was staring up at the stage with her mouth slightly agape, her fork frozen halfway to her mouth. Rio followed her gaze and chuckled. “Woooooow…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That pulled Alice out of her daze. “Huh? What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re drooling, and it’s not for the food,” Rio teased, bumping her friend’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Alice said, popping her bite into her mouth finally. “This mushroom risotto is delicious.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh-huh, sure,” Rio said, rolling her eyes before eating a few more bites of food.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The guests clapped, and Rio realized that the first speech was over. She glanced up at the stage, only for her eyes to go wide as the next speaker took the podium.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Alice chuckled beside her. “Pot meet kettle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shush,” Rio huffed, smacking blindly at her friend as her gaze was fixed pointedly on the woman at the podium.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good evening,” the woman in purple greeted. “I’m Agatha Harkness, Editor-in-Chief of </span>
<em>
<span>Tarot</span>
</em>
<span>. As Jen said earlier, I’d like to welcome everyone to our annual Fall Gala…”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha. </span>
</em>
<span>Rio pressed her tongue to the inside of her cheek as the name rattled around in her mind. It was an unusual name for this century, but somehow it fit the striking woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Over the last eight years, </span>
<em>
<span>Tarot</span>
</em>
<span> has focused on amplifying women’s visions and voices in fashion,” Agatha was saying. “Moving forward, we vow to continue this focus, while expanding our selection to include more female-identifying, non-binary, and queer contributors.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still think she isn’t gay?” Rio asked, leaning close to whisper to Alice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not definitive proof,” Alice argued, sipping her champagne.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a sip of her water and wrinkled her nose. “Bleh. I’m going to get a drink.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just get back here in time for our second set,” Alice warned her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio crossed the room to the open bar and ordered a Shirley Temple, sipping it slowly as she took a moment to people-watch. Another woman was making a speech now— older, with curly gray hair, draped in a gold satin gown. Rio’s eyes scanned the room, seeking a flash of brilliant purple so intently that she almost missed it when the woman sidled up beside her, seeming to appear out of thin air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll have what she’s having,” Agatha told the bartender, gesturing toward Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The heat low in her belly was almost enough to distract Rio from what Agatha had said— </span>
<em>
<span>almost.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, no, you don’t want—” Rio began, but Agatha waved her off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bartender handed Agatha her drink and she took a sip, eyes narrowing and her nose wrinkling as she swallowed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s no alcohol in this,” she said, tone accusatory, looking at the bartender.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled. “It’s a Shirley Temple, there’s not supposed to be alcohol.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked from her drink to the glass in Rio’s hands before looking up at her face in confusion. Rio reached into her pocket and retrieved a coin, holding it out for Agatha to inspect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Five years sober,” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha read, eyes widening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s actually seven years now, I just haven’t gotten another coin,” Rio told her, tucking it back into her pocket. “Maybe I’ll get another one when I’m a decade sober. I order mocktails to blend in at things like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. She took another sip of her drink and wrinkled her nose at the sweetness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t mind if I…” she trailed off, gesturing vaguely at the wall of spirits behind the bar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course not,” Rio replied. “Just because I choose not to partake doesn’t mean other people can’t do so responsibly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vodka cranberry, preferably Grey Goose,” Agatha told the bartender, handing back her Shirley Temple. She looked back at Rio. “I don’t think I can get through another hour of this without a little something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think if I had to socialize with all these people, I’d want something, too,” Rio chuckled. She turned to face Agatha and extended her hand. “I’m Rio, by the way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha Harkness,” she replied, placing her hand in Rio’s. Her skin was soft against Rio’s, and she trailed the pad of her thumb against one of Rio’s callouses. “You play beautifully.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Rio muttered, and though she had heard it more times than she could count Rio could feel her ears turn pink at the praise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a grin that Rio could only describe as predatory before releasing her hand to take her drink from the bartender. Rio’s eyes couldn’t help but trace the column of her throat as she took her first sip, the muscles in her throat flexing beneath pale skin, and then of course her gaze drifted lower.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I particularly enjoyed your cover of </span>
<em>
<span>Take Me to Church,” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha continued.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio dragged her eyes back up to Agatha’s face. She could tell from the older woman’s smirk that she knew exactly what Rio had been looking at, and that she didn’t mind in the least. Agatha leaned in close to whisper her next words in Rio’s ear. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Did you play it for me?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her words, the low rasp of her voice, the warmth of her breath on Rio’s ear— For a moment, Rio’s brain short-circuited, all higher thought abandoned. Finally, Rio was able to stutter out a response.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe,” she replied, sipping the last bit of her drink through the straw.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smirk widened before she took a sip of her own drink. “Is that what you do to pick up women? Play a sexy song on the cello, then chat them up at the bar?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised a brow at her. “Is it working?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Maybe,” Agatha repeated over the rim of her glass. “The almost-strip tease was a nice touch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, but before she could say anything else a few piano chords drifted through the air. She looked across the room and saw that Alice was already in place at the keyboard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m afraid that’s my cue,” Rio said, standing and smoothing down her blouse. She couldn’t help but notice the way Agatha followed the motions of her hands with those keen blue eyes. “I get another break in an hour.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, do you?” Agatha replied with feigned disinterest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned before walking away, making sure to add a bit of extra swagger to her steps as she went. She could still feel Agatha’s eyes on her as she sat beside Alice and picked up her cello.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I take it you got your definitive proof?” Alice whispered over the freestyle blues she was playing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Definitely,” Rio replied. “Do you think if we play faster, our next set break will get here quicker?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice chuckled. “That’s not how this works, unfortunately, and you know it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Normally the second half of their set was Rio’s favorite, but tonight it felt like it dragged on forever. They played more pop pieces, but they also threw in some improvisational blues and jazz, partially for their own entertainment. Then they each took a turn playing solos for half an hour, giving the other a break, before playing their final bit together. Rio had drawn the short straw to have her break second, so as Alice slipped away, Rio kept playing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she played, every once in a while Rio would sense that she was being watched. That wasn’t exactly unusual— she was the entertainment, after all— but in this case it was a particular gaze that she sensed on her. The hairs on the back of her neck prickled, and a heat built low in her belly, but when she looked around she couldn’t find Agatha anywhere in the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Alice finally returned from her break, Rio laid down her cello and looked around the room, ignoring Alice’s quiet reminder that she needed to </span>
<em>
<span>be back in thirty minutes or so help me God—</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Five minutes later, Rio was sure that Agatha wasn’t in the ballroom. It was a large space, sure, and there were a lot of people, but Rio was sure she would’ve spotted her. After five minutes of looking, Rio knew she looked desperate, but frankly she didn’t care. The older woman had her spell bound.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped out of the ballroom into the hallway, the only place she hadn’t looked, and there, leaning against the opposite wall, was Agatha, two glasses in her hands, looking at Rio expectantly. Rio gaped at her for a long moment before stepping toward her, trying for nonchalant but likely failing from the way Agatha smirked at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you’d never find me,” Agatha said, holding out one of the glasses toward her. Rio took the drink and then took a small sip, pleased to find that it was yet another Shirley Temple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I was just trying to get some fresh air,” Rio said with a shrug. Agatha’s eyes followed the rise and fall of Rio’s shoulders, and it sent a thrill down her spine. “You just happened to be here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fresh air, huh?” Agatha’s smirk widened as she pushed herself away from the wall. “Follow me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio followed behind Agatha, noting that the back of the dress plunged just as deeply as the front, exposing the lean muscles of her back and the long line of her spine. They made their way further down the hall, and Agatha picked up her skirt to step over a velvet divider that marked the rest of the house as off-limits from guests, Rio scrambling close behind, up a series of stairs, before opening a door and ushering Rio inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where are— </span>
<em>
<span>Oh!” </span>
</em>
<span>Rio exclaimed, looking around with wide eyes. The room was a stunning, conservatory-style space with an elegant glass ceiling supported by elegant wooden beams. There were no lights, but the glass walls and ceiling let in enough natural moonlight to fill the space. The room was filled with greenery, with potted plants of all sizes positioned on every side of the room, and in the center a small fountain bubbled. The air here was far more humid than the rest of the house, and Rio could feel her blouse clinging to her skin already.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They call this the Winter Garden,” Agatha told her. “We didn’t rent it out for the event, but it was by far my favorite room of the house when we did the tour.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can see why,” Rio replied, stepping further into the space. A small sitting area was tucked away to one side of the fountain, with multiple chairs and a Victorian settee, the cushions all covered with a gold and purple velvet brocade. Rio placed her half-empty glass on the small table there, and Agatha moved to do the same, bringing her into Rio’s space.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt the heat of Agatha’s body behind her and turned before the woman could touch her, catching Agatha with her arms outstretched toward her hips. Rio stepped forward, so that Agatha’s hands immediately fell into place at her waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is this what you do to pick up women?” Rio asked, recalling Agatha’s words from earlier. “Flirt with a girl over drinks, then whisk her away to a private room to have your way with her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could see the way Agatha’s cheeks flushed, even in the moonlight, as her eyes flashed dangerously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe,” Agatha replied, also turning Rio’s words around. “Is it working?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed her. She wasn’t sure who closed the space between them, who pulled who close. All she knew was that she had one hand buried in Agatha’s hair, the other on her waist, and Agatha’s lips were on hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knew the moment Agatha’s lips opened against hers and her tongue slid into the other woman’s mouth that she was in trouble. Rio was an addict, and while she carried a coin in her pocket to remind herself of her recovery, she knew that it wasn’t something she could ever truly overcome. Addiction, for her, was almost an intrinsic part of her personality. Recovery had meant finding things more socially acceptable than booze and pills to be addicted to. It was the reason she poured herself into music, the reason she read so much, the reason she spent hours in the gym. Once she got hooked on something, Rio craved more and more, never quite satisfied that she had enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t think she would ever get enough of Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t the lingering taste of vodka on her lips; Rio had never really cared for the </span>
<em>
<span>taste</span>
</em>
<span> of alcohol, she had just wanted it to numb her, and kissing Agatha did the opposite of numbing her. Rio was hyper aware of every sensation, every sound, from the soft swish of Agatha’s silk skirt as Rio’s knee pressed up between her legs, to the deep resounding moan that left her lips in response to the pressure.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Fuck,” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha hissed as Rio trailed kisses down the long line of her neck, sucking and nipping at the skin. When she reached the spot where her neck met her shoulder, Rio sucked deeply, surely leaving a mark that would turn just as purple as the dress Agatha was wearing. Then she pressed lower, kissing and licking the sharp press of the other woman’s sternum before nosing at the billowing fabric that covered Agatha’s breasts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled back in frustration when the fabric didn’t budge. “What the hell?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled low in her throat. “Sorry, darling, I’m taped into this thing. If I had known this was going to happen, I might have risked a wardrobe malfunction, but unfortunately for both of us…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned dejectedly, lowering her face once again to Agatha’s chest. She kissed and sucked at what skin she could get to, until Agatha tugged at her hair and pulled her back up to kiss her lips again. Finally, Rio pulled back, stepping slightly out of the other woman’s grip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you want?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked her up and down before stepping back and sitting on the end of the settee. Then she slowly pulled the skirt of her dress up, exposing inch after inch of pale skin on long legs that spread until Rio could see pale lace panties underneath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want you on your knees,” Agatha said, voice low. “I want your mouth on me, and then I want those fingers inside me. And after that, I want to make you come.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>At that moment, Rio knew: Agatha Harkness might be her most dangerous addiction yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio dropped to her knees with no hesitation. She reached for Agatha’s face, cupping her jaw and stealing one more kiss before lowering herself fully. Agatha leaned back on her arms, watching Rio with those bright eyes and parted lips. Normally, Rio would drag this out, but she was on a time limit here, and from this angle she could tell that Agatha was plenty ready for her. She tugged the sodden lace to the side, out of her way, before surging forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hands wrapped around Agatha’s hips, pulling her closer to the edge of the settee, her fingers digging into the silk of her skirt, as she ran her tongue through her folds. Rio had always loved the taste of a woman, but Agatha…</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t get enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t get enough of the sounds Agatha made, her moans and sighs thick in the humid air but still echoing off the glass walls. Rio explored, searching out the spots that made the woman’s hips buck and thighs shake, and made the prettiest sounds leave her lips. Somehow Agatha seemed to grow even wetter, and Rio endeavored to lick up every bit of nectar she could reach. When she pressed her tongue wide against Agatha’s clit, the woman started bucking, riding her tongue in earnest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right there, yes, oh fuck,” Agatha whimpered. She reached down and grasped at Rio’s hand with her own. “Need… need your fingers… inside… </span>
<em>
<span>inside.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gripped her skirt, holding it out of the way, and Rio moved her hand beneath her chin, sliding her middle finger inside Agatha with no hesitation. The sound that left Agatha’s throat was low and wild, and so loud that Rio was sure they probably heard it in the ballroom, but neither of them could find it in themselves to care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“More,” Agatha gasped. “Fuck, give me more…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A second finger joined the first, and it took every bit of the strength in Rio’s other arm to hold Agatha’s hips down as they bucked against her. Rio fucked into her harder as Agatha grinded against her tongue. Rio’s eyes darted up, and the vision above her was almost enough to make her come in her pants without even being touched: Agatha’s head was thrown back, eyes closed, mouth open and panting. A flush darkened her skin from her cheeks, down her long graceful neck, to her chest. Love bites littered her neck and chest, undeniable evidence of exactly what Rio had done to her, </span>
<em>
<span>was doing to her.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re so fucking beautiful,” Rio rasped against her, curling her fingers hard inside before sucking Agatha’s clit between her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha came with a deep moan, thighs closing around Rio’s head as wetness coated her face. Rio kept her fingers moving, softer now, and she laved her tongue gently against Agatha’s clit, drawing out the other woman’s pleasure until she tugged at Rio’s hair, too sensitive for her to continue. Rio rocked back on her heels and sucked her fingers into her mouth, determined to taste every last drop of the other woman that she could, before looking up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was laid back on the settee, looking absolutely debauched. Rio chuckled quietly to herself before crawling on her knees around the settee to Agatha’s head and pressing a kiss to her parted lips. Agatha opened her eyes and stared at her in wonder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll return the favor as soon as I get the feeling back in my legs,” the brunette assured her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled again. “No time, I’m afraid. I’m already late returning to my break.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood from the floor, her knees popping loudly. She was uncomfortably wet beneath her suit, but one more glance at Agatha made it worth it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, wait,” Agatha protested, propping herself up with one hand and reaching for Rio with the other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s okay, really,” Rio assured her. “But I really do have to go or Alice is going to kill me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could argue further, Rio pressed one more quick kiss to her lips and hurried from the room, aware that if she stayed any longer she wouldn’t be able to bring herself to leave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice scowled at her as she picked up her cello and took her seat. “Your </span>
<em>
<span>break</span>
</em>
<span> ran fifteen minutes over, asshole. We only have thirty minutes left to play.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Feel free to deduct it out of my half of the fee,” Rio huffed, shifting uncomfortably in her seat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They played three more pieces before the CEO of the company stepped back up to the mic and bid everyone a goodnight, and then they played a couple more as everyone left. Rio packed her cello away as Alice closed the lid of the baby grand she had been playing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to make sure they have our payment information,” Alice told her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, I’m going to the bathroom, and then I’ll meet you at the car,” Rio replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She grabbed her cello and hurried to the restroom, a room that was just as fancy as the rest of the house. The room was empty as she took care of her business and tried to clean herself up, but as she washed her hands the door behind her opened and a familiar figure entered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hair was neatly in place, her makeup redone, her dress completely unwrinkled. The only indication that she had been fucked within an inch of her life not an hour earlier was the deep purple hickey at the base of her neck, almost blending in with the silk of her dress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned at the sight, turning around to face the other woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha—” she began, only for the breath to be knocked out of her as Agatha surged toward her, holding Rio’s face between her hands and pulling her into a passionate kiss. Rio moaned as Agatha’s tongue dipped into her mouth and her hips pinned Rio’s against the counter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was breathless when Agatha finally pulled back. She held something up between them, a black business card, before tucking it into Rio’s breast pocket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s for you to call me later,” Agatha told her, tapping her pocket for emphasis. Then she trailed her fingers lower, teasing at Rio’s skin through her blouse, until they met the clasp of her pants.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice is… waiting,” Rio protested half heartedly as Agatha deftly unfastened the button and lowered the zipper of her slacks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have a feeling this won’t take long,” Agatha grinned against her lips. “And I don’t like leaving things uneven.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tensed at Agatha’s words, causing the other woman to pause, her hand resting flat against Rio’s heaving stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is it?” Agatha asked, concern lacing her tone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing,” Rio said quickly, too quickly. Agatha started to pull her hand back, but Rio caught her by the wrist. “I just… Sometimes I get lost in my head, and have a hard time… </span>
<em>
<span>getting there.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her intently for a moment before her lips turned up in a soft smile. She pressed a soft kiss to the corner of Rio’s lips as her hand went back to rest against her abdomen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want me to stop?” she asked with another soft kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knew she should say yes. Alice would be waiting, plotting her murder. But then Agatha kissed her so softly, tenderly again, making it clear that it was okay no matter what Rio’s answer was…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio said, her voice little more than a breath. “Please don’t stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gasped as Agatha’s hand slid inside her pants and beneath the waist of her underwear in one go, the sound swallowed by Agatha’s lips on hers. Agatha’s mouth was just as insistent as her fingers, her tongue parting Rio’s lips as her fingers dipped between her wet folds, her tongue licking hot against Rio’s as she circled Rio’s clit. She swirled her fingers firmly, each circle winding Rio higher and higher, until she pulled her lips free from Agatha’s so she could catch her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh god,” Rio shuddered, thighs trembling as she buried her face in Agatha’s neck. There was no getting lost in her thoughts, no distractions, there was nothing but Agatha, </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>, the feel of her, the scent of her perfume, the sound of her breaths in Rio’s ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want me inside?” Agatha’s voice in her ear sounded just as undone as Rio felt, and it sent her even higher toward her peak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Rio gasped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha’s fingers left her clit Rio whined in protest, but Agatha soothed her with soft sighs and kisses against the side of her head as her fingers delved further. Rio could feel how the woman’s hand strained in the confines of her pants, but Agatha didn’t complain, nor did she let it slow her down. She slipped into Rio with her middle and ring finger, and Rio groaned at the sensation. Agatha’s fingers stretched her just enough, but she was so wet that Agatha was knuckle-deep in one smooth movement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, you feel so good,” Agatha groaned, curling her fingers slightly and making Rio’s knees shake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please,” Rio whined, grinding her hips into Agatha’s hand in desperation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at Rio hungrily as she began slowly thrusting into her, finding the perfect angle so she could curl her fingers against the front of her opening and drag her palm over Rio’s clit with each thrust. Rio braced herself with one hand on the counter behind her and the other wrapped around Agatha’s shoulder, fingers twisting in long brown hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A high whine escaped Rio’s lips as she moved her hips to meet Agatha’s thrusts. Every move, every curl of the other woman’s fingers inside her had Rio reeling higher and higher as the coil in her belly wound tighter and tighter. Her release was close, so </span>
<em>
<span>achingly </span>
</em>
<span>close, if she could just get there. Her hips stuttered against Agatha’s hands, urging her to go faster, to give her more before the moment slipped away from her. Rio’s eyes opened, flicking from the stall behind Agatha to the bathroom door to the ceiling above her. She needed to hurry, Alice was waiting, and if someone needed the bathroom…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stay with me,” Agatha said suddenly, her voice pulling Rio back into the moment. Her right hand came up and gripped the back of Rio’s neck roughly, forcing her to look at Agatha’s face, anchoring her in the moment. “That’s it, good girl.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shuddered. She stared into blue eyes for a long moment as she trembled, right on the edge, before it was all too much. “Agatha—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve got you,” Agatha whispered, dragging her palm hard across Rio’s clit. “Come for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shattered. Her vision went white as her body arched and shook, waves of pleasure crashing through her. Her thighs slammed closed, trapping Agatha’s hand between them, but Agatha just kept moving slowly, coaxing her gently and drawing out every last tremor of ecstasy. When it became too much, Rio released her hold on the counter, her knuckles aching from how tightly she had held on, and she grasped Agatha’s wrist, tugging her away gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio sighed, tilting her head until her forehead rested against the other woman’s. Agatha’s other hand was still on the back of her neck, gently stroking the baby hairs there as Rio continued to come down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re gorgeous when you come,” Agatha whispered into her ear. “Makes me want to fuck you again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The breath Rio hadn’t completely caught stuttered in her throat at the other woman’s words. Agatha pressed a final kiss to the corner of her lips before stepping back slowly, making sure Rio’s legs could support her before fully pulling away. She smoothed down the silk of her dress as Rio fastened her pants, and Rio couldn’t help but notice the wet stains the fingers of her left hand made on the purple silk. Rio’s cheeks flushed pink as Agatha shook her hair back into place before finally meeting her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t forget,” Agatha said, reaching forward and tapping at her card through Rio’s pocket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, unable to find words. With a final toss of her hair, Agatha turned the bolt on the bathroom door and disappeared back into the hall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s legs almost collapsed beneath her as she turned toward the mirror. </span>
<em>
<span>What the fuck was that? </span>
</em>
<span>She looked at her reflection in the mirror, at the way her hair was falling loose from her low bun, at the red flush that still dominated her face and neck, at the wrinkles in her blouse, the way her makeup was smeared all to hell. There was no denying exactly what she had been doing, but there was no time to try and fix herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She grabbed her cello from where she had tucked it in the corner of the bathroom and hurried from the room. Thankfully all of the guests from the gala had already cleared out, leaving only a few staff in the hall and they paid her no mind, too caught up in their own work.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The night air felt even chillier against Rio’s sweat-damp skin. She looked around and found Alice leaning against the wall a few feet away from the entrance, a long-suffering look on her face as Rio approached.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, um…” Rio began.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here’s what’s going to happen,” Alice said, her voice level as she pushed away from the wall. “You’re going to pay for the cab because you owe me that much for waiting. And then when we get back to the apartment, you’re going to tell me all about how you fucked in the bathroom so I can live vicariously through you. Deal?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, moving toward the street so she could hail a cab. “Deal.”</span>

<p>
<span>“If freshmen can’t figure out key signatures, how the hell are they going to graduate with a music degree in four years?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up from the paper she was grading to the other woman sitting across from her. Alice sat cross-legged on the floor of their shared apartment, two laptops in front of her. One screen showed the online testing module they used for exams, while the other showed the official grading portal for posting the students’ grades. She and Alice both assisted with the freshman music theory course, as they had for the last three semesters. They always ended up bringing their grading home, especially during exam season, and would end up sprawled across the floor of their living room while Alice graded the music theory section and Rio graded the essays.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’ll kick in once they get to piano proficiency,” Rio assured her, leaning back against the sofa behind her. She tapped her stylus against the tablet in her hand impatiently. Call her old fashioned, but she hated technology. There was just something about eviscerating a printed essay with a red ink pen that was so much more satisfying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice set aside her laptops and stretched out her legs. “I’m about halfway done. How many essays do you have left?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio checked the counter at the top of her screen. “Twenty-seven.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice stared at her. </span>
<em>
<span>“Twenty-seven? </span>
</em>
<span>Have you been staring at the same essay for the last ten minutes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio said defensively. </span>
<em>
<span>More like thirty. </span>
</em>
<span>“It’s not my fault that high schools don’t teach kids how to write a decent essay anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, high schools haven’t been teaching kids how to write a decent essay since before covid and you know it.” Alice’s brows knit with concern. “What’s going on with you? You haven’t been yourself all week.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s nothing,” Rio replied, scrolling down on her tablet, pretending that her mind was processing the words on the screen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice stared at her for a minute. “This wouldn’t have anything to do with a certain woman in a purple dress that gave you the best orgasm of your life in a public restroom, would it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio almost dropped the tablet she was holding. “What? No, of course not, I— </span>
<em>
<span>pshh</span>
</em>
<span>. No, no, it has nothing to do with—”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha.</span>

</p><p>
<span>She stopped talking, realizing she was digging herself into a deeper hole. Across from her, Alice grinned devilishly, drawing her knees up to her chest and propping her chin in her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Spill, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned and dropped her head back against the cushions as she laid the tablet aside. Telling Alice was inevitable, really, though she had managed to avoid it for days. Alice had been her best friend since they met in undergrad, she had seen Rio through all the ups and downs of her life, including her pregnancy and the adoption. She had been there for Rio through two detoxes, and was still Rio’s biggest supporter in her sobriety. Hell, Alice had only agreed to get her masters and doctorate because Rio had pressured her to go alongside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t that Rio didn’t </span>
<em>
<span>want</span>
</em>
<span> to tell Alice. Goodness knows she needed the other woman’s support and input on this whole situation. It was more the absurdity of the entire thing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So… you remember when I got pregnant and gave the baby up for adoption?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay, maybe not the best way to start the conversation, and by the look on Alice’s face, Rio could tell she felt the same way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do I remember you showing up at my mom’s house half out of your mind in withdrawals and telling me you were pregnant? Do I remember going to your prenatal appointments with you? Holding your hand while you squeezed a whole ass baby out of your vagina?” Alice counted off on her fingers. “Yeah, Rio, it rings a bell. But what the heck does it have to do with the woman you hooked up with?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well the baby kind of showed up at my office last Tuesday,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice stared at her. “The baby… Rio, it’s been </span>
<em>
<span>nine years.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, so he isn’t a baby anymore, he’s a whole ass kid now,” Rio huffed. “His name is Nicholas. He found his adoption file and googled my name, found my name on the college’s webpage and took a bus here without any adult supervision. And then I took him back home and left him with his mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh shit,” Alice said, voice barely more than a whisper. “Are you okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened her mouth to respond with an automatic </span>
<em>
<span>I’m fine, </span>
</em>
<span>but she paused. This was Alice, so she didn’t have to pretend. And she wasn’t fine, not really, but also she didn’t exactly know how she felt about the whole situation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I— I don’t know,” she admitted, hands clenching in her lap. “It… It’s brought up a lot. A lot of memories, a lot of… trauma. But at the same time, I’m so happy to have met him, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice smiled gently. “Yeah, I bet. Tell me about him?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s… amazing,” Rio said with a smile, warmth flooding her chest at the thought of the boy. “He looks so much like me it’s unreal. He has my eyes and my smile and it’s… kind of creepy, honestly, but also really cool. He plays basketball and baseball and soccer and he sings in his school choir and he’s just… he’s so smart, and mischievous, and </span>
<em>
<span>god</span>
</em>
<span>, I—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt tears welling up in her eyes. “I knew I loved him. I loved him when I carried him and when I gave him up. And for all these years I’ve loved this </span>
<em>
<span>idea of him</span>
</em>
<span>, but now I’ve seen him and he’s real, he’s flesh and bone and he’s better than anything I could’ve imagined and I just… I love him so much it hurts, Alice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice immediately set her laptops aside and scooted across the floor to sit beside Rio, who gratefully leaned into her side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you going to contact him again?” Alice asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” Rio replied. “I want to. But it’s a closed adoption.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I still say that was a stupid decision,” Alice muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wiped her tears and chose not to comment. They had had that particular discussion multiple times while Rio was pregnant, and she had made her decision for her own reasons, in spite of her friend’s opinion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I gave his mom my contact information, so if she wants to reach out she can,” Rio told her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t mention that she also has Agatha’s contact information. She had been trying not to think of it. Reaching out felt wrong, after everything that had happened. She had put the ball in Agatha’s court, and if she decided to reach out then Rio would respond. If not… Well, Rio had made her decision nine years ago, and she had lived with it ever since, so surely she could live with it now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m still confused about something,” Alice said, scooting away slightly so she could look at Rio. “I thought whatever crisis you were having was about that woman you hooked up with a couple weeks ago. What was her name again? Agnes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio supplied, biting her lip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, and your reaction earlier seemed to confirm it,” Alice continued. “But then you tell me about your long-lost kid showing up. So I’m just a little confused about how you went from Point A to Point B in this breakdown.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifted her weight anxiously. “Funny story, that. You see, Agatha, well, she’s kinda, um… Nicky’s adoptive mother.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice stared at her in shock, eyes wide, mouth agape. After a minute her jaw started bobbing, mouth opening and closing but no words coming forth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded in understanding. “Yep, that was my reaction, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her words seemed to kickstart Alice’s brain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please tell me you’re joking,” she sputtered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That would be the worst joke in the history of mankind,” Rio remarked. “And yet, fate is playing it on me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you’re telling me that you had sex with your kid’s mom?” Alice exclaimed. “Which, out of context, would be a normal thing, but in </span>
<em>
<span>your case…”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, it’s crazy, I’m aware,” Rio said. “We agreed that it could never happen again, but…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But what?” Alice pushed, narrowing her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Huh?” Rio replied. “Oh, </span>
<em>
<span>but</span>
</em>
<span> nothing. Sleeping with her again would be a </span>
<em>
<span>horrible </span>
</em>
<span>idea.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice studied her for a long moment before her eyes widened in shock. She grabbed a book off the coffee table and smacked Rio in the head with it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Ouch!</span>
</em>
<span> What was that for?” Rio exclaimed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re thinking about it,” Alice accused. “I can’t believe you’re actually thinking about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thinking about what?” Rio demanded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re thinking about having sex with her again!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t say that!” Rio argued.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t have to say it, you were thinking it,” Alice told her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, so you can read my mind now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You say that like it’s hard to do,” Alice deadpanned. Rio crossed her arms in irritation and glared at her, but Alice didn’t back down. “You’re really gonna tell me you </span>
<em>
<span>aren’t</span>
</em>
<span> thinking about it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glared at her for another minute, the lie on the tip of her tongue, but it wouldn’t come. She sighed, uncrossing her arms. “Fine, I was </span>
<em>
<span>thinking</span>
</em>
<span> about it. That’s not a crime.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio!” Alice pulled her arm back to smack Rio again but she managed to wrestle the paperback out of the other woman’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop that!” Rio huffed, trying to smooth out the wrinkles in the book cover.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You </span>
<em>
<span>cannot </span>
</em>
<span>have sex with her again!” Alice insisted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know that!” Rio exclaimed. “I am very aware of how monumentally disastrous it would be to have sex with her again, okay? But am I not allowed to be disappointed? I mean, the woman gave me one of, if not </span>
<em>
<span>the best </span>
</em>
<span>orgasm of my life in a public restroom, Alice. I spent four days fantasizing about what she might be capable of in an </span>
<em>
<span>actual bed </span>
</em>
<span>before I found out she adopted my kid. It’s really fucking complicated, I know that, and I know rationally that we can’t have sex again or pursue a relationship, but damn it if I’m not more than a little disappointed by that fact, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice stared at her with wide eyes. “Wow… those sessions with your therapist are really paying off, huh?”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now it was Rio’s turn to smack Alice with the book.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Ow ow ow”</span>
</em>
<span> Alice exclaimed between giggles, holding her arms up defensively.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck you,” Rio muttered, but there was no malice in the words. She sighed and picked up her tablet in an attempt to go back to grading.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So… question,” Alice said. “Agatha is obviously out of bounds for you but, um… What about her coworker Jen… for me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to murder you with this book, I swear,” Rio growled, brandishing the paperback menacingly.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Nooooooo! Uncle! UNCLE!”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Saturday morning found Rio navigating familiar streets. The city was alive around her, with people out and about enjoying the unusually warm fall day. Rio moved through the chaos with purpose, her sneakers rasping against the pavement, hands stuffed into the pockets of her jeans to hide the slight tremor in her fingers. She knew this part of the city well— Greenwich Village, where the streets twisted in ways Manhattan’s grid did not, where she had spent the last six years slipping in and out of quiet little cafes that smelled of espresso and textbooks— but being on familiar turf did nothing to calm Rio’s racing heart and mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The text from Agatha had come the night before: </span>
<em>
<span>Nicky is asking if he can see you again.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The very idea had thrilled Rio to no end, but she had reined in her excitement. She could still remember how Agatha had looked at her: as if she were a grenade about to explode and completely upend her life. She needed to handle the situation delicately, even if that wasn’t something that came naturally to her.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>I would love to see him again. Just tell me when and where.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had held her breath as she watched the ellipsis pop up on her screen, indicating Agatha was typing a response, only to disappear. The symbol had reappeared a few seconds later, only to disappear yet again. After five separate attempts, Agatha’s response had finally come through.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I think you and I should meet alone first, to share some background and set boundaries. Are you free this weekend?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>A few texts later and they had scheduled this meetup. Apparently Agatha had some work she needed to finish at her office that morning, so Rio had suggested they meet for brunch afterwards. Rio had chosen the cafe, and Agatha had agreed even though it wasn’t exactly close to her office. It was a place more often frequented by college students than professionals, but it had multiple private rooms designed for studying that would offer them a modicum of privacy for their discussion, but that wasn’t the real reason she had chosen this place. She had chosen it because it belonged to </span>
<em>
<span>her, </span>
</em>
<span>not to Agatha. She hoped that the home field advantage would ground her, maybe stop her from getting lost in Agatha’s undeniable gravity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she turned the corner toward the cafe, Rio realized how futile that hope had been.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was early, and waiting outside the cafe for her. She was leaning against the brick wall, a pair of oversized sunglasses on her face, looking down at the phone in her hand. Her long hair fell in messy waves around her shoulders, and as Rio watched she ran her fingers through it to push it to one side and out of her face. She wore a simple white t-shirt tucked into black slacks, and a blazer was draped neatly over her arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Christ on a cracker, this woman had no business being so attractive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blew out a long breath, collecting herself as she continued toward where Agatha was waiting. She could do this, she was a grown woman, she was a professional, she—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up as she approached, the sound of Rio’s shoes on the concrete drawing her attention, and the sun caught her sharp jaw and high cheekbones.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning,” Rio said brightly, trying to ignore the swooping feeling in the pit of her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a quick once-over, obvious even behind her sunglasses, before responding in a slightly-gravelly tone, “Morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifted anxiously from one foot to the other before she gestured toward the door. “Shall we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded and followed Rio into the restaurant, removing her sunglasses as she stepped through the door. Rio made her way to the counter, examining the chalkboard menu on the wall as she went. She was pleased to see that very little had changed since she had last visited. Out of the corner of her eyes she saw Agatha’s eyes go from studying Rio to squinting at the menu as if she couldn’t read it. As they approached the front of the line, Agatha looked at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Any suggestions?” she asked, gesturing toward the large menu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In my experience, everything is good,” Rio told her. “If you want something sweet, their French toast is amazing. Personally, I prefer crepes, and you can choose from a sweet or savory filling. I’m not a huge fan of eggs, but my friend Alice always gets an omelet. Or if you’re really feeling bougie, you can get poached eggs and smoked salmon on avocado toast.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled. “That might be a little too bougie, even for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, stepping toward the front of the line. She ordered her usual favorite— crepes with a lemon curd and blueberry compote filling, and an oat milk latte. Agatha stepped up to the register and placed her own order— a veggie omelet with no onions and extra cheese, and a caramel macchiato. Their coffees came up first, and as Agatha took a sip of her drink she let out a soft moan that made Rio’s stomach flutter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t have you pegged for a sweet coffee girl,” Rio commented. “I expected straight espresso.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “I’d rather drink motor oil.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, leading Agatha away from the counter and through the dining room to a narrow hallway lined with open doors. Each doorway opened to a small private study room, each one furnished slightly differently. Rio chose one of the smaller rooms with a couple of plush chairs around a battered wooden table. She made a small note on the whiteboard by the door so the waitstaff could deliver their meals before plopping down in one of the chairs with a sigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I take it you come here a lot,” Agatha remarked, sitting in the opposite chair with far more grace than Rio had done.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not as much now as I did when I was doing my masters,” Rio replied. “It’s a great place for study groups, but a lot of my doctoral work is done in the studio at this point.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow as she sipped her coffee. “You’re working toward your doctorate?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yep, in Music Performance and Composition,” Rio replied with a smile. “By next May, you’ll be looking at Dr. Rio Vidal, PhD.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Very impressive,” Agatha commended. “And what will you do, once you’re Dr. Vidal?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “I’m keeping my options open. Academia is an option, or playing professionally. There’s a lot of opportunity for that in the city, but there’s also plenty of competition. Personally, I enjoy the composing and producing side of music. My dissertation is all about combining different genres and technology in modern compositions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took another sip of her coffee. “I’m going to pretend that I understood half of what you just said and be extremely impressed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a soft laugh. A waitress chose that moment to bring their plates, and for a few minutes they sat in comfortable silence as they tucked in to their food. As Rio cut her crepe, Agatha looked at her curiously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lemon curd?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, spearing a bite on her fork. “It’s delicious, wanna taste?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was, perhaps, too intimate of an offer, but Rio only realized it after the words left her mouth. She had no qualms about sharing her food, especially when it was something she enjoyed so much. But Agatha’s cheeks turned a faint pink and she coughed, looking down at her own plate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, thank you. I’m just surprised, because you said you didn’t care for eggs,” she said, finally looking back at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked at her in confusion. “I don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her for a moment. “Rio, one of the main ingredients in any type of curd is egg yolks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio exclaimed, sputtering into her coffee. “No! Absolutely not!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s true,” Agatha said with a chuckle, taking a bite of her omelet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her crepe with distrust. She took another measured bite and considered the taste, then shrugged. “Well, I can’t taste it. And it’s mostly a texture thing for me anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dropped her fork. “Oh my god.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio asked, pausing as she chewed her next bite.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re the reason he won’t eat eggs!” Agatha accused, pointing at her. “Nicky </span>
<em>
<span>hates </span>
</em>
<span>eggs, always has, doesn’t matter how they’re cooked. He says he doesn’t like how they feel in his mouth.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh wow, that’s insane,” Rio laughed, warmth filling her chest. A thought crossed her mind. “You know, while I was pregnant, I actually </span>
<em>
<span>craved </span>
</em>
<span>egg salad. For about a month in my first trimester I ate it every single day. It was so bad because I loved the taste but hated the texture. Then one day it made me sick and I haven’t touched it or any other egg product since.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, Nicky hates them with a passion. I don’t even eat them much myself because he complains about the smell when they’re cooking,” Agatha told her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled. “Of all the random things for him to inherit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seems that’s not all he inherited,” Agatha continued.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh?” Rio replied, trying not to sound too desperate for more information. From the look Agatha gave her, she failed miserably at that, but the other woman indulged her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think he inherited your ear for music. So far it’s mostly singing, but he’s very good, and I don’t just say that because I’m biased,” Agatha explained. “I signed him up for piano when he was five, but getting him to practice was an absolute nightmare. I told him we could revisit that when he was older. His music class has done a few experimental runs with instruments this year, but next year he’ll start with more in-depth lessons to be part of the school orchestra.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s amazing,” Rio said. She set her elbow on the table, resting her chin on her hand and leaning toward Agatha intently. Gone was any qualm about being too interested.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s athletic as well,” Agatha continued, “and while I can take some credit for his musical ability, I have absolutely zero coordination or athletic ability. So all of that must be genetic. Who knows, maybe in a few years he’ll save me a few thousand dollars and go to college on an athletic scholarship like you did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio started to laugh, but the sound got caught in her throat. She looked at Agatha with wide, confused eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never told you that I had an athletic scholarship,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Who do you think taught Nicky to use Google? I did my research on you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifted uncomfortably in her seat. “And what exactly did you find?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You were born in Florida but moved to Massachusetts when you were in middle school. Your father was a music teacher, your mother was a nurse. You played basketball and softball in high school and got into Boston University on a combination basketball and music scholarship. You tore your ACL in your junior year, right at the beginning of the season,” Agatha paused, looking at Rio. “Your parents died in a car accident at the end of your junior year at BU. After that I didn’t find much mention of your name in newspapers, but I did find you mentioned on social media as part of an alt rock band that was only active for a year or so.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “That’s… all accurate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought it was interesting that the band stopped posting anything on socials just a few months before Nicky’s birthdate,” Agatha commented.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pushed the food across her plate, her appetite fading. “Yeah, me getting knocked up really put a damper on the whole rockstar thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, but Rio quickly looked away. She put another bite of food in her mouth, but now the sweetness felt like too much. She set her plate aside and picked up her coffee instead. The liquid was only lukewarm at this point, but she drank it anyway, if only to look like she was doing something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t mean to offend you,” Agatha said after a beat. “It’s not irrational of me to want to know about my son’s biological mother, about the woman he wants to bring into our lives.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her choice of words made Rio pause. </span>
<em>
<span>The woman </span>
</em>
<span>he </span>
<em>
<span>wants to bring into </span>
</em>
<span>our </span>
<em>
<span>lives. </span>
</em>
<span>Did Agatha not want her as part of their lives? Was it because they had sex? Or was it because of Rio’s relation to Nicky? Would Agatha have invited a romantic relationship between the two of them if Rio wasn’t Nicky’s birth mother? Would she have welcomed a relationship between Nicky and Rio if they hadn’t had sex before?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Was there any point at all to this mental spiral when the reality was sitting across the table from her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not irrational,” Rio agreed reluctantly. “It’s just… the period of my life when Nicky was conceived isn’t something I look back on fondly. So having someone look into my past isn’t something that I welcome or enjoy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s expression softened. She set her plate aside and folded her hands carefully in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can understand that,” she said, her voice measured. “I can even relate to it, in my own way. I went through a nasty divorce a few years before I adopted Nicky. In the aftermath, I made choices that I’m not particularly proud of, developed a reputation that I’ll probably never completely shake. I’m surprised you’re not more upset that I’m the person who adopted him, based on what a Google search would find on me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s cheeks heated. “I haven’t… I mean, I didn’t realize you were someone noteworthy enough to Google. Hell, I’m surprised you were able to find so much information on me. I’m a nobody.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow. “Everybody is somebody, Rio. And in the world of social media, it’s fairly easy to access. Your information was mainly local newspaper articles about your participation in school sports and orchestra. </span>
<em>
<span>My information, </span>
</em>
<span>however, is tabloid fodder.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Rio said, still embarrassed that she hadn’t even thought to run a simple Google search on Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When you do look me up, because now that we’ve had this conversation I have no doubt that will be the first thing you do once we’re done here,” Agatha continued, “I ask that you don’t judge me for what you find. And in return, I offer you the same courtesy. Whatever you share with me about your past, whatever you’re ashamed of, I won’t hold that against you. I just want to know that I can trust you with my son now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. She recognized Agatha’s admission for what it was— an olive branch. As uncomfortable as it was to talk about her past, Agatha deserved to know to make a decision about whether or not to allow her in Nicky’s life. It was better for Agatha to find out all the negatives now than to find out later and feel that Rio had hidden it from her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio said, drawing in a deep breath. “After my parents died, I spiraled. I started drinking… </span>
<em>
<span>heavily. </span>
</em>
<span>I also started to abuse the pain pills I was prescribed after I tore my ACL. My grades tanked and I decided to drop out before I failed out. I moved back to Florida and lived with my dad’s brother for a little while. Then I joined a band, playing guitar, and started using other shit… heroin, cocaine, molly. I thought it was just part of the life, but really it was just me trying to numb myself to everything— the loss, the grief, the feeling of failure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And then one day I got sick, and I thought it was just a hangover. But then I was sick the next day, and the next day, and the day after that. So I did the math on when my period was and I peed on a stick. I found out I was pregnant while the band’s lead singer was snorting coke off the sink three feet away from me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face was a stony mask. Rio couldn’t tell if she was sympathetic or angry or disappointed in her story. But she kept going.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I went to the clinic the next day and I was one week past the legal limit for an abortion,” she continued. “But I did some research and found out that in Massachusetts, the limit is much later. So I scrounged together enough money for a plane ticket and flew back to Boston. I scheduled an appointment and called my friend Alice and asked if I could stay with her— she had just graduated and was living with her mom. When I got to Alice’s house, I met her mom— you might’ve heard of her, Lorna Wu.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The name broke Agatha’s expressionless facade. “Your friend’s mother is </span>
<em>
<span>the Lorna Wu? </span>
</em>
<span>As in </span>
<em>
<span>Lorna Wu and the Coral Shore?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Yep, that’s her,” Rio nodded. “And let’s just say Lorna has some experience with wannabe rockstars with addiction problems. I don’t know what it was about her and Alice, but… for the first time in two years, I felt safe enough to ask for help, and they were kind enough to say yes. I never went to the clinic in Boston, obviously. I detoxed in Lorna’s spare bedroom, and I was sober for the rest of my pregnancy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at her hands. Rio could tell she wanted to say something, but was holding back. Before she could, Rio had a question of her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is Nicky—?” she began, but she couldn’t find the words. Agatha looked up at her again, and Rio squirmed nervously. “I’ve always wondered… always worried… Is he </span>
<em>
<span>normal? </span>
</em>
<span>Like…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did your drinking and drug use affect him? Is that what you’re asking?” Agatha clarified, her tone low.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath caught in her throat, and she nodded, unable to summon words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. “I knew you used while you were pregnant, Rio, it was in Nicky’s file when I adopted him. He has ADHD, and his pediatrician says similar symptoms can be caused by fetal alcohol exposure, but that it can also be genetic or any number of other factors.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I, um, also have ADHD,” Rio told her. “I didn’t get diagnosed until after Nicky was born.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” Agatha nodded. “I don’t know if we’ll ever know if his ADHD was worsened by your drinking, but just know it’s managed. His school is one of the best in the country at helping neurodivergent children. He’s kept active and engaged, he gets biweekly sessions with a therapist who helps him with coping strategies and symptom management. We’ve even managed to avoid stimulant medications so far.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt tears welling up in her eyes, and she wiped at them harshly. “Oh my god. He’s… he’s so freaking lucky to have a mom like you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled softly. “I’m the lucky one. I’d do anything for my boy, don’t you ever doubt it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sniffled, trying to control her tears, then smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you ever consider keeping him?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her smile faded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I… Maybe for a minute,” she admitted. “But I knew I couldn’t. For </span>
<em>
<span>so </span>
</em>
<span>many reasons. Financially, emotionally… I wasn’t prepared to be a mother. And I knew there were people out there who were ready, </span>
<em>
<span>more than ready</span>
</em>
<span> to be parents so I just… I made my choice. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but I’ve never doubted that it was the right one. For both of us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded in understanding, but her lips pursed in contemplation. “You said… the night we met…” Her cheeks flushed pink, but she continued. “You said you’ve been sober for seven years, but Nicky is nine…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And the math isn’t mathing in your head,” Rio finished her sentence with a nod of her own. “I fell off the bandwagon about three months after Nicky was born. I never went back to the hard stuff, but the drinking… It started socially, but then I started drinking more and more to numb myself. It took me almost two years to admit that I had a problem again. And once again, I have Alice and Lorna to thank for getting me help. I started going to AA meetings, started seeing a therapist. Alice inspired me to start playing again, convinced me to finish my degree. Then I decided I wanted to further my education, and she agreed to get her masters at the same time. And I pretty much bullied her into getting her doctorate with me as well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She sounds like a wonderful friend,” Agatha commented with a soft smile. “You’re lucky to have such a strong support system now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re right, I really am,” Rio agreed. She considered, for a moment, mentioning that Alice wanted to date Agatha’s coworker, but decided that that was probably a piece of information better left for a later conversation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha drummed her fingers on the table for a moment before speaking again. “So… are there any family medical conditions I should know about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brows knit in confusion at the sudden change in subject. “No, not that I know of. My mom had an uncle who had lung cancer I think, but he was also a chainsmoker, so… nothing hereditary.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “And do you have any health problems? Any issues from your drug use? Any diseases?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was many things, but she wasn’t stupid. Agatha’s line of questioning had turned very sharply to the topic of medical history, and Rio could only deduce one reason for this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, what’s going on?” she asked, voice thick with concern.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just need to know—“ Agatha began.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is Nicky sick?” Rio demanded, heart hammering in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The answer had to be </span>
<em>
<span>no. </span>
</em>
<span>Rio thought back to her interactions with the boy, however brief. He looked to be in excellent health, all bright eyed and energetic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But from the look on Agatha’s face, Rio already knew the answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky has a congenital kidney malformation,” Agatha told her. “It was diagnosed a few weeks after he was born, and before you ask, it wasn’t caused by anything you did. The doctors told me it was just a fluke, one of those things that pops up every once in a while for no reason at all. He had surgery as an infant, and one kidney was beyond saving but they were able to repair the other one. But a few months ago I noticed he was getting tired easily, and his hands and feet were swelling. The doctors tested him and the scar tissue is causing that one remaining kidney to fail.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room suddenly felt too small for Rio, like the walls had somehow gotten closer. Her breath caught in her throat and her heart pounded in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her baby was sick.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No, he wasn’t hers, she had given him up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But he was, </span>
<em>
<span>he was hers, </span>
</em>
<span>in some way. He was a piece of her, even if she had given him up. And now she had him back, had a chance to know him, a chance she’d never thought she would have.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I can’t lose him. I just got him. Please…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up into piercing blue eyes, eyes that reflected her own emotions. Agatha… God, Rio couldn’t imagine how she was feeling. If Rio was feeling this after only knowing Nicky so briefly, Agatha must be in hell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached out and covered Agatha’s hands with her own. The other woman looked startled for a moment; she clearly hadn’t expected Rio to touch her. But then she turned her hands over to hold Rio’s, squeezing slightly, and Rio squeezed back.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You’re not alone in your love for him. And you’re not alone in this.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“He needs a kidney transplant,” Agatha told her. “I’m not a match, and his nephrologist says the best chance for a match is a blood relative. That’s why I pulled the adoption file out of the safe and had it on my desk in my office where Nicky found it. I was going to contact you, but he beat me to it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A— a transplant?” Rio stuttered. That sounded like a lot for a kid to go through. But Agatha said Nicky had already had surgery as an infant, surely he would be okay this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know it’s a lot to ask,” Agatha said. “You’d have to get tested to see if you’re a match, and the doctor says there’s only a fifty percent chance for a biological parent to match their child, but I figured—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You want me to donate my kidney?” Rio asked, her mind catching up with the situation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like I said, I know it’s a lot—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, of course I’ll get tested. Of course I’ll give him a kidney if it’s a match,” Rio interrupted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widened in amazement. “You will?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” Rio repeated. “I let the kid stay rent free in my uterus for nine months, I might as well give him a kidney, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her for a long moment before her words sank in. Then she laughed, throwing her head back in full abandon, and she laughed so hard that she snorted. Rio felt her heart soar at the sound.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god,” Agatha said between giggles and the occasional snort. Tears were also streaming down her cheeks, and Rio got the sense they were tears of relief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s his treatment plan right now?” Rio asked once Agatha’s giggles— and snorts— had mostly subsided.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He goes to dialysis three times a week,” Agatha told her. “He’s doing well with it, and the doctor says he could live for years with the protocol, so we have time to find a donor match. But he hates it, and I can’t really blame him. Plus being sick is going to severely limit him doing things he likes to do, like sports. So I’m pursuing every avenue to find a donor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “I would do the same thing in your shoes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached into her purse and dug out a card that she slid across the table to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is the contact information for the donation center,” she said. “You can call them to set up an appointment to see if you’re a match. From my understanding, it’s just a blood test to check for compatibility. And since you’re looking to donate to Nicky, my insurance will cover any of the costs, so don’t worry about any of that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right,” Rio replied, staring at the card. “Hopefully Nicky’s kidneys took after mine as much as the rest of him did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hopefully,” Agatha agreed. She hesitated for a moment, then added, “I know you said that you don’t know who his father is, but if you have any idea, do you think he—?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio said with a sigh, looking down at her hands. “Look, Agatha, back then, when I was strung out, I would do almost anything for my next hit. Even though I was a lesbian with zero interest in sex with men, if that’s what it took to get a fix, then I’d do it. Sometimes I knew their names, sometimes I didn’t, I didn’t care. It’s not something I’m proud of, but it’s… That’s how Nicky came to be. And I’d prefer it if he never found out. As far as I’m concerned, Nicky was made from scratch, from magic, from whatever you want to say, but I made him all by myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a long, measuring look before nodding solemnly. “Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes widened in surprise. “Okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not going to rule it out completely,” Agatha told her. “If Nicky’s condition deteriorates before we can find a donor… Well, desperate times might call for desperate measures. We might be able to use one of those ancestry test things to find his biological father. But it will be the very </span>
<em>
<span>last </span>
</em>
<span>resort. I agree that Nicky doesn’t need to know what led to his conception.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Rio sighed, her body sagging with relief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached across the table and patted the back of her hand. Rio chuckled at the awkward attempt at comfort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be sure to call first thing Monday morning,” Rio said, tucking the card into her pocket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sounds good,” Agatha agreed. “Also, are you free next Friday?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um, yeah, as far as I know,” Rio replied. “Normally I would have classes, but it’s fall break, so my schedule next week is wide open.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great,” Agatha smiled. “Nicky and I would like to invite you to go with us to the aquarium. They’re debuting a new seahorse exhibit and he’s very excited. I thought I would sign him out of school early, grab lunch, make an afternoon of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You want me to go?” Rio asked, genuinely surprised. “I wasn’t sure you’d want me to do anything with him, other than maybe give him my kidney.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. “Rio, even if you’re not a match and can’t donate, Nicky wants to get to know you. He wants you to be part of his life. I won’t deny him that.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What about you? </span>
</em>
<span>Rio wanted to ask. </span>
<em>
<span>Do you want me as part of your lives? </span>
</em>
<span>But again, she knew the question was pointless, so she kept it to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she said, “I’d love to go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, but it seemed forced. “Excellent. I’ll text you the details.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With that Agatha stood from the table, the nervous energy practically rolling off of her. Rio stood as well, realizing that their time together was over. They gathered their belongings and Agatha lead the way to the exit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you for meeting with me,” Agatha said once they were outside, her tone crisp, like they had just held a business meeting rather than a deep conversation where Rio revealed the most traumatic parts of her past.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No problem, anytime,” Rio replied, as if she was willing to meet and spill her soul on demand. “I’ll see you and Nicky next Friday?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmhmm,” Agatha hummed, moving toward a black car that was parked on the street. As she approached a man hopped out of the driver’s side, hurried around the car, and opened the back door for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s jaw dropped. She wasn’t sure why she was surprised, considering what Agatha had said earlier. But she was definitely googling the other woman when she got home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Goodbye, Rio,” Agatha said as she sat gracefully in the towncar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio picked her jaw up off the pavement and shook her head.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Te veo,” </span>
</em>
<span>she said with a smile.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I’ll see you.</span>
</em>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio pulled her jacket tighter around her as she made her way into the lobby of NYU Langone Health. Fall had truly arrived in the city, bringing with it crisp temperatures and cool breezes. Inside, the hospital lobby felt just as cold, and not just because of the air conditioning blasting cold air from the vents. The architects had clearly tried to make the space appear warmer, with teak wood accent walls and large windows that looked out onto the street, but those efforts couldn’t quite overcome the harsh fluorescent lights and the sterile smell of antiseptic that permeated the air.</p><p>Rio bypassed the reception desk, making her way toward the elevators. She double checked the digital directory quickly before joining the queue for an elevator going up.</p><p>
<em><strong> Transplant Institute- 8th Floor</strong> </em>
</p><p>Rio swallowed down the lump that formed in her throat as the elevator doors closed. A few seconds later they opened again, and she stepped out onto the transplant floor.</p><p>She made her way down a long, window-lined corridor until she came to a spacious waiting area. Rows of minimalist chairs sat clustered around the room, and a wall-mounted television played a muted news broadcast that was largely ignored by the few people already waiting. Rio made her way up to the check-in counter, where a woman with curly hair and long nails took her information before handing over a stack of forms on a clipboard.</p><p>Rio went through the forms quickly, then sat holding the clipboard, looking around the room awkwardly. She had made a point to give herself extra time to get here, and for once the NYC transportation systems had been prompt, so she had arrived half an hour early for her appointment. Even after filling out the forms, she had a good chunk of time to kill.</p><p>She pulled her phone out of her pocket and opened a game only to immediately close it, open it again, and close it again. Then she opened the internet browser and, for at least the fiftieth time in the last five days, typed in the name <em> Agatha Harkness, </em>and hovered her thumb over the search button.</p><p>Rio had Googled the hospital— turned out this was one of the best transplant hospitals in the country, not that Agatha would’ve accepted any less for Nicky. Rio had even Googled herself, to see exactly what Agatha had seen, and sure enough she had found a collection of newspaper articles from her high school and undergrad years, as well as her parents’ obituaries and a news article on their car accident. But every time she typed Agatha’s name in, she hesitated.</p><p>It was stupid, really. Agatha had basically given her permission to search her up, so it wasn’t like she was betraying her trust or being creepy about it. And it wasn’t that she didn’t want to know more about Nicky’s mother, she was definitely curious, so much so that it felt like a literal gnawing in her stomach. No, Rio’s hesitation was brought on by fear.</p><p>Rio was afraid of what she would find, and of how she might react to it. Agatha had sounded certain that Rio wouldn’t like what she discovered about her. But if that were true… then what? So far their very limited interactions had left Rio with nothing but respect for the other woman— well, respect and attraction, but she was trying to ignore the latter. If Rio found something in her research that made her see Agatha in a different light, that made her feel like Agatha was a bad person, how would that affect their dynamic? She had to get along with Agatha to stay in Nicky’s life, so what if what she found made that difficult if not impossible?</p><p>Rio scoffed, the sound drawing the eyes of a middle-aged woman with a reverse bob haircut sitting a few chairs away. Rio had to fight the urge to give her the middle finger for the way she looked down her nose toward her.</p><p>This was stupid. She had told Agatha about <em> her </em> past and the woman had still invited her to spend time with Nicholas. Surely if Agatha could extend grace to her over her checkered history, she could do the same for whatever Agatha had done.</p><p>Rio pressed enter.</p><p>“Rosario Vidal?” a nurse called from the examination area.</p><p>
<em> Well fuck. </em>
</p><p>Rio tucked her phone into her pocket as she stood and made her way to the nurse.</p><p>“That’s me,” she said, handing over the clipboard.</p><p>The nurse ushered her to a scale where she checked Rio’s weight, then into an exam room where she took Rio’s vitals. Once she was finished, the nurse stepped out and a doctor quickly breezed in.</p><p>“Hello, Ms. Vidal, I’m Dr. Carter,” the doctor said, shaking Rio’s hand before she took a seat on the rolling stool. “So you’re here because you want to donate a kidney?”</p><p>“Yes, and please, call me Rio.”</p><p>“Well, Rio, the file says you’re a blood relation to Nicholas Harkness?” Dr. Carter asked as she logged into the computer while simultaneously glancing at the paperwork.</p><p>“Yes, he’s my… Well, I’m his biological mother,” she explained. “I gave him up for adoption when he was born.”</p><p>“Oh my,” Dr. Carter said, reclining back against the counter now that she had everything set up. “Well, that’s unusual. As you may already know, a biological parent has about a fifty percent chance of being a match for donation.”</p><p>“Yes, Agatha— Nicholas’s adoptive mother— told me as much,” Rio replied.</p><p>Dr. Carter leveled Rio with a measuring look. “Ms. Vidal— Rio— before we go any further, I have to ask: Have you been pressured, coerced, or in any way bribed to donate a kidney to Nicholas?”</p><p>Rio had expected the question. She had gone down a rabbit trail of researching the kidney donation process, and multiple websites had said that donors were asked this, to make sure they were actually willing participants.</p><p>“Not at all,” she assured the doctor. “We reconnected recently, and Agatha told me he needed a transplant. I happily agreed to come get tested and, if I’m a match, I’m totally willing to donate.”</p><p>Dr. Carter nodded. “Good, thank you. We have to ask, you understand. And you’ll likely be asked again, if you’re a match, when you meet with the counselor and donor advocate.”</p><p>“I understand,” Rio told her.</p><p>“Looking at your questionnaire, it says there’s no known family history of any renal disease, no cancer, no cardiovascular disease, no autoimmune disorders…” Dr. Carter kept reading as she trailed her finger down the list. “You’ve been pregnant in the past, obviously. Any chance you’re pregnant now or plans to get pregnant in the near future?”</p><p>“Nope,” Rio replied.</p><p>“Birth control method?” Dr. Carter asked.</p><p>“Lesbianism,” Rio deadpanned.</p><p>Dr. Carter paused in her perusal and chuckled. “I’ve heard that’s very effective.”</p><p>“Ninety-nine point nine percent,” Rio told her.</p><p>“Well, let’s try to avoid any point one percents for the foreseeable future,” Dr. Carter replied. “It says here you don’t smoke, drink, or use any recreational drugs, but you have in the past. How recently?”</p><p>“I’ve been sober for seven years,” Rio said nervously.</p><p>“In my experience, if you haven’t had any noticeable issues with organ function, then that shouldn’t be a problem,” Dr. Carter assured her. “We’ll know for sure once we do your twenty-four hour urine test.”</p><p>They went through the rest of the questionnaire in depth, and once they were finished Dr. Carter saw no reason Rio couldn’t be a donor, as long as she was a match.</p><p>“The next step is a blood test,” Dr. Carter told her. “We’ll double check your blood type, just in case. We’ll also check crossmatching, which means we’ll mix your blood cells with Nicholas’s to see if his antibodies attack your blood cells. Finally, we’ll do tissue typing, which compares your white blood cells to the recipient’s. We’ll also do a standard workup and disease screening. So don’t be intimidated by the number of vials you see.”</p><p>“Sounds good,” Rio nodded.</p><p>“I’ll send the nurse in to do the blood draw,” Dr. Carter said, standing. “It was lovely meeting you, Rio. I hope I’ll be seeing you soon.”</p><p>“Thank you, Doctor,” Rio replied.</p><p> </p><p>An ungodly number of blood vials later, Rio was back on the subway headed back to campus. She pulled out her phone to text Alice when the results of her earlier search popped up on her screen.</p><p>Rio glanced around her, making sure no one was close enough to see her screen, then shook her head. It wasn’t like she was watching porn on the subway. But when she looked at the results, her body reacted as if she was.</p><p>The first thing the search results displayed was a series of images, photos of Agatha from various events and publications. She was fully dressed in all of them, of course, but even so Rio couldn’t help her instinctive response. Agatha was an attractive woman, and in most of the photos she was either in some sort of gown or a business suit. One photo showed Agatha in a short black dress with a slit on the side that showed long pale legs that seemed to go on for miles. Rio remembered just how those legs felt thrown over her shoulders—</p><p>
<em> Nope! Moving on! </em>
</p><p>Rio scrolled past the images to the text and found that Agatha Harkness had her own Wikipedia page. She clicked the link and began reading.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p><em> Agatha Vivienne Harkness (born August 18, 1983) is an American media executive, heiress, and philanthropist. She has served as editor-in-chief of </em> <b> <em>Tarot </em> </b> <em> since its founding eight years ago. She is the sole living descendent of the prominent Harkness family of Massachusetts through her late father, politician Hiram Harkness, and great-granddaughter of railroad titan Elias Fairmont through her mother, Evanora Harkness (née Fairmont). </em></p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened as she finished the paragraph. So Agatha wasn’t just well-off, she was <em> Rich, </em>with a capital R. She scrolled down to keep reading, jaw dropping with each revelation. Agatha’s father had been a state senator, then lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, before becoming a member of the federal House of Representatives, like his father before him. In fact, almost every male member of Agatha’s paternal family had been some sort of politician for several generations. Her mother was a wealthy heiress and socialite.</p><p>Young Agatha quickly earned a reputation as a rebel, getting kicked out of three private schools as a teenager. She chose to study fashion, rather than politics or business, then switched to journalism and communications. She worked as a political journalist for all of six months after college before quitting and moving to New York City where she got a job as a junior fashion editor with <em> Harper’s Bazaar. </em> She then worked her way up in the industry, eventually working as a senior editor at <em> Vogue </em>before taking a two-year hiatus at what should’ve been the height of her career.</p><p>Rio looked up from the article as she got off the subway. She did quick math in her head as she climbed the stairs up to the street— that would’ve been around the time Agatha adopted Nicholas.</p><p>Rio grabbed takeout from a deli at the end of her street, reading the next part of the article as she waited. Agatha had returned to the fashion industry with a splash, founding <em> Tarot </em> with her former mentor, Lilia Calderu, and Jennifer Kale, who was rumored to have been Agatha’s rival during their time at <em> Vogue. </em>The publication focused on female designers and women’s issues, but over the years had become known for spotlighting queer fashion and LGBT+ content.</p><p>There was a section titled <em> Charity Work, </em>which talked about how Agatha had raised money for several LGBT+ charities, AIDS research, Alzheimer's research, Planned Parenthood, and a plethora of other causes. She was also an avid supporter of many democratic political figures. Her fundraising galas were considered highlights of the New England social season, whatever that meant.</p><p>As Rio dug into her dinner— a toasted turkey sandwich and side of tomato soup— she scrolled down to the <em> Personal Life </em>section of the page.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Harkness is a lesbian. She was rumored to be in a relationship with socialite Margaret Winstead during her college years, but those rumors were seemingly squashed in 2005, when Harkness announced her engagement to Ralph Bohner, son of business mogul and politician James Bohner. Harkness and Bohner reported an amicable end to their relationship after ten months. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Following her father’s death in 2009, Harkness began openly dating women. </em>
</p><p>
<em> In 2010, Harkness began dating New York attorney Daphne Blake. The two announced their engagement in January of 2012. The couple were married in August 2012, but the marriage ended in an annulment in December 2012 after rumors of infidelity. Blake later alleged that the relationship was faked in order to further both of their careers. </em>
</p><p>
<em> In 2013, Harkness took a hiatus from Vogue and temporarily returned to Boston to care for her aging mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Harkness adopted her son, Nicholas, in June of 2013. The two currently reside in New York City. </em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure how she felt about Nicholas being mentioned, but she supposed it was just something that came along with Agatha’s career and social status. The other information was definitely… <em> interesting. </em>She clicked back off the Wikipedia page and went to the image search, filtering the results by most recent.</p><p>The first image was from the gala where she and Agatha had met, and it showed Agatha in that stunning purple gown alongside her partners at <em> Tarot </em>, Lilia and Jennifer. There was a photo of Agatha at a fashion show several months ago, dressed in a navy pinstripe suit with a skinny black tie. Rio clicked the image, and several related images popped up, many showing the woman seated beside Agatha. In some of them Agatha had her arm thrown nonchalantly around the woman’s shoulders, in others she was leaning close and whispering in her ear. Rio frowned and read the headline attached to the photos:</p><p>
<em><strong> Agatha Harkness seen with tech mogul Lydia Steele during New York Fashion Week</strong> </em>
</p><p>Rio clicked off those photos and scrolled back further. Most of the photos showed Agatha alone, but every so often she would appear with another woman on her arm.</p><p>Rio found another photo of Agatha in the short black dress, which appeared to be from an appearance on a late night interview program in 2019. A related candid photo showed Agatha out at a restaurant with the late-night host, her hand high on the other woman’s thigh beneath the table.</p><p>
<em><strong> Are Zara Quinn and Agatha Harkness dating? Rumors swirl after the two are seen out just weeks after the fashion mogul’s flirtatious appearance on New York Tonight.</strong> </em>
</p><p>Rio scowled. She scrolled quickly, eyes only flicking through the photos, until she came to a several photos of Agatha with a woman she recognized— Wanda Maximoff, an actress Rio knew from her roles in sitcoms. She clicked on one and a headline popped up:</p><p>
<em><strong> Homewrecker? Is Agatha Harkness to blame for Wanda Maximoff’s recent divorce?</strong> </em>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but she kept looking at the photos. The two women were certainly close. In one photo, the red-headed actress pressed a kiss to a younger Agatha’s cheek, and Agatha gave the camera an impish smile.</p><p>Rio put the phone down and ran her fingers through her hair. She wasn’t jealous— <em> she wasn’t. </em> She had no business being jealous. She and Agatha were what? <em> Friends? </em> Rio’s nose wrinkled at the thought. They were nothing, really, just two people brought together by circumstance trying to navigate the weirdest co-parenting situation known to man.</p><p>Rio picked up her phone and clicked back again, scrolling further. She found what looked like a mugshot from 2013, but that couldn't be right. She clicked on the photo and a headline popped up.</p><p>
<strong> <em>Agatha Harkness arrested for soliciting a prostitute</em> </strong>
</p><p>Rio's eyes widened as she read the article. Police had arrested Agatha for soliciting a prostitute, but upon further investigation it was found that no money had been exchanged. Instead, Agatha had only given the woman her business card. Prosecutors tried to say this was to have the woman contact her later so Agatha could secure her <em>services, </em>but Agatha had testified that she was only offering the woman her card because she thought the woman had the potential to become a model, and she wanted to put her in touch with a modeling agent. The charges were eventually dropped, as no money had been exchanged, but the damage to her reputation had been done. The article concluded with speculation that Agatha had sought out the services of a prostitute as a response to the claims made by her ex-wife. Several articles were linked at the bottom of the page, and Rio clicked on one.</p><p>She found a photo of Agatha in a flowing white dress, beside a woman in an equally stunning white gown, on a white stone balcony overlooking the ocean. Below that was a plethora of related photos— more of Agatha in her wedding gown, some candid shots of her and her ex-wife in various European locales, and finally one of Agatha back in New York City, looking the most disheveled Rio had ever seen her, frowning as she exited an attorney’s office.</p><p>
<em><strong> Whirlwind Romance Gone Wrong: Agatha Harkness seeks annulment from Daphne Sinclair after one month of marriage</strong> </em>
</p><p>Rio scrolled back up to study Agatha’s ex-wife. She had bright blonde hair, gray eyes, and a narrow face that looked pinched in most of the photos Rio could find of her. She was objectively pretty, Rio admitted, though she was also aware of her own bias. Really, Rio thought she bore a marked resemblance to a ferret.</p><p>The article detailed the couple's destination wedding, including a long list of a-list guests. But the story quickly turned into speculation of infidelity on both sides, with claims that the couple were seen out separately while on their honeymoon and with other women.</p><p>A list of related articles was also at the bottom of this page, and one caught Rio’s attention: </p><p>
<em><strong> In Love or in Business: Daphne Sinclair and Agatha Harkness were only together for career gains</strong> </em>
</p><p>A year after their failed marriage, Daphne Sinclair had launched her political campaign to become a New York state representative, and questions were asked about her failed marriage. Blake claimed that the entire relationship had been a sham, that she and Agatha had agreed to date each other for publicity. Agatha’s political connections were beneficial for the budding politician, and Sinclair claimed that her firm had handled some tricky business for Agatha, although she claimed attorney-client privilege when asked for further details. The article ended with a single statement from Agatha, or more likely her public relations specialist:</p><p>
<em> Miss Harkness declined to comment on her relationship with Miss Sinclair at this time, but she wishes her well in her future campaign. </em>
</p><p>Rio scrolled back to the photos. Images of Agatha before her wedding showed a completely different woman— her hair was styled sleek and straight, her cheeks were fuller, she wore a lot more makeup than Rio had ever seen her wear. Her smile was wide, but there was something about it that didn’t quite meet her eyes. Did that mean that she wasn’t really in love with the woman she was with? There was more: in every picture of her and her ex, something about her pose made her look small, as if she were the plus-one. It was a sharp contrast to the woman Rio knew, the one in the more recent photos, who owned the space she occupied.</p><p>Rio wasn't sure if the fake marriage story was true or not, but she could tell from these photos and her own personal experience that the woman pictured wasn't truly happy.</p><p>Rio scrolled back a bit further. She found a photo of twenty-something-year-old Agatha in her first engagement announcement, standing stiffly beside a young man who looked just as uncomfortable, both of them flanked by people Rio assumed were their parents. Then there was an earlier photo, Agatha when she was eighteen, sandwiched between her parents at some sort of political affair. Her long dark hair was up, her full cheeks were flushed pink, and if Rio had to guess from her glazed blue eyes, underage Agatha had gotten into the champagne. She was cute, Rio thought, but even cuter was the oldest photo of Agatha that she could find, this one a newspaper clipping of Agatha at sixteen in a white debutante gown, her dark hair cut into a tight bob with heavy bangs, frowning at the camera even as her parents smiled on either side of her.</p><p>Rio smiled at the image. She had a feeling teenage Agatha had been a hoot.</p><p>She closed the tab on her phone and began cleaning up her mess. She threw away her food wrappers and looked around the kitchen, needing something to do with her hands. There were a few dishes that needed washing, so she filled the sink with soapy water and went to work, her mind still spinning with what she had read. As she thought, Agatha’s words came back to her:</p><p>
<em> I ask that you don’t judge me for what you find. And in return, I offer you the same courtesy. </em>
</p><p>Rio had a past. It wasn’t the same as Agatha’s, but it was bad in its own way. But it was the past. And Agatha had chosen to look past it, and she still invited Rio into her life, into Nicky’s life, and allowed her to have a relationship with her son. If Agatha could do that for her, then Rio could do the same.</p><p>Her phone buzzed as she placed the last dish in the drainer, and Agatha’s contact flashed up on her screen. <em> Speak of the devil. </em>Rio opened the text.</p><p><b> <em>Agatha:</em> </b> <em> How did your appointment go? </em></p><p align="right">
<em> Everything was good. The results of the blood tests should be in by early next week. </em>
</p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> Make sure you hydrate. I remember how much blood those tests take. </em></p><p>The urge to reply <em> Yes, mommy </em>was strong. Instead, Rio gave the message a simple thumbs up reaction. She started to put the phone away when the ellipsis popped up, disappeared, and popped up again before her phone buzzed and another message appeared.</p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> Nicky is very excited about Friday. Are you still available? </em></p><p>Rio’s heart swelled at the thought of the little boy’s excitement. Of course, he was probably just excited about getting out of school and going to the aquarium to see seahorses. Rio grinned and typed a response.</p><p align="right">
<em> Wild seahorses couldn’t keep me away. </em>
</p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> Haha, very funny. </em></p><p align="right">
<em> Thank you, I’m hilarious. </em>
</p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> And clearly humble as well. </em></p><p>Rio blinked at her phone. Oh shit, were they… <em> flirting? </em></p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> I’m picking Nicky up from school after lunch. We’ll pick you up around 12:30? </em></p><p align="right">
<em> 12:30 sounds perfect. I’ll send you the address. </em>
</p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> See you then. Goodnight, Rio. </em></p><p align="right">
<em> Te veo. </em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>If someone had told Rio Vidal two weeks ago that she’d ever ride across the Brooklyn Bridge in the back of a modified luxury SUV, she would’ve laughed. But here she was, sat beside Nicholas and across from Agatha in the back of a custom Cadillac Escalade. Nicky was practically buzzing with excitement, both at the impending aquarium visit and Rio’s presence, and Rio soaked it in heartily.</p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, was quiet. She hadn’t spoken much since Rio had gotten in the car, instead alternating between staring out the window and watching Rio and Nicky. She wasn’t part of the conversation, though she replied whenever they included her and laughed at appropriate times, but there was something strained about her smile. Rio couldn’t help but notice the way her fingers gripped at the armrests, her knuckles nearly white from the tension, but Rio didn’t know the source of the other woman’s anxiety, or how she might help ease it.</p><p>“So tell me about the aquarium,” Rio said, resting her chin in her palm and looking at Nicky. “What animal are you most excited to see, besides the seahorses? Which one is your favorite?”</p><p>“The octopus,” Nicky said with zero hesitation. “Did you know that an octopus has 3 hearts? And they have blue blood?”</p><p>Rio blinked in surprise. “I did not know that.”</p><p>“Yeah, and they’re super smart,” Nicky said. “Sometimes the keepers will drop a jar with food inside into the octopus’s enclosure and he can open it with his suckers. It’s so cool.”</p><p>“That’s awesome,” Rio chuckled.</p><p>“Mmhmm,” Nicky nodded in agreement. “What animal is your favorite?”</p><p>“The sharks, duh,” Rio replied, fully aware that her answer was so basic that it bordered on lame.</p><p>Nicky, however, gasped, his eyes widening dramatically. “Oh my gosh! Did you know they have a leucistic zebra shark at the aquarium?”</p><p>“A <em> what </em> shark?” Rio asked.</p><p>“<em> Leucistic. </em>It means white. They have a white zebra shark. He’s really pretty, but in the wild he would’ve been eaten up! Because he can’t camouflage,” Nicky explained.</p><p>“That’s super cool,” Rio said. “You’ll have to help me find it when we get there.”</p><p>Nicky sighed. “Rio, weren’t you listening? It’s a <em> white shark. </em>You can’t miss it.”</p><p>Rio giggled. “Good point, bud. You’re right.” She glanced at Agatha. “And what about you, Agatha, what’s your favorite animal at the aquarium?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened in surprise at being included in the conversation. “Oh, um—”</p><p>“I know!” Nicky interjected before Agatha could formulate a response. “Mama likes the sea otters best!”</p><p>“Lies and calumny,” Agatha said with a haughty frown. “My favorites are the cuttlefish. They change color.”</p><p>“Oh yeah? Then why do you always spend <em> forever </em> watching the otters and talking about how cute they are?” Nicky asked, crossing his arms.</p><p>Rio had to cover her mouth to keep from laughing as Nicky and Agatha held each other’s gazes in a staring match. Finally Agatha sighed.</p><p>“Fine, I like the otters, so sue me,” she huffed, throwing her hands up dramatically. Nicky giggled.</p><p>“Hmm, I expected something with more teeth, like an eel,” Rio said truthfully.</p><p>“Otters have teeth,” Agatha replied. “And they can be very ferocious hunters.”</p><p>“Suuuuure,” Rio teased.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, the tension easing from her shoulders ever so slightly.</p><p>“Clint, what’s your favorite animal in the aquarium?” Nicky asked, looking at the back of the driver’s head expectantly.</p><p>The man looked back at them in the rearview mirror, his gruff demeanor temporarily softened by Nicky including him in the conversation.</p><p>“That’s easy,” he said. “The archerfish.”<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>As soon as they arrived at the aquarium, Nicky grabbed Rio by the hand and practically dragged her to the doors, with Agatha following close behind. Then they stood in the short line, with Nicky bouncing on the balls of his feet between them. He wore a pair of khakis and a polo beneath a navy sweatshirt with his school’s logo printed on the front, and a pair of well-worn black Converse. Rio was similarly clad, in her old Boston University sweatshirt, jeans, and sneakers. Agatha was the odd one out, still dressed for the office in a pale gray blazer over a crisp white blouse and navy pencil skirt. Rio wasn’t entirely sure Agatha knew the meaning of casual dress, in spite of being a fashion mogul.</p><p>As they stepped up to the front of the queue, Rio began to unzip her purse to find her debit card, but Agatha placed a hand on her arm.</p><p>“I can buy my own ticket, Agatha,” Rio said softly.</p><p>“No need, you’re my guest,” she said, stepping closer to the clerk. “Hello, Agatha and Nicholas Harkness and one guest.”</p><p>The clerk typed something in on her tablet and then nodded. “Of course, Miss Harkness. I hope you all enjoy your visit.”</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha in confusion as they stepped through the door.</p><p>“I’m one of the aquarium’s benefactors,” Agatha explained. “Nicky’s class took a field trip here when he was in third grade and I realized how much he loved it, so I became a donor. Nicky and I have honorary passes, and I can get guest tickets as needed.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, somehow surprised and yet not surprised at the same time. “That’s… convenient.”</p><p>“Yes, it is that,” Agatha chuckled. “It’s for a worthy cause. My donations help cover field trip costs for schools in low-income neighborhoods.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, but before she could truly process the information, Nicky was pulling both her and Agatha further into the aquarium.</p><p>“Come on, there’s an hour and a half until the last show in the Aquatheater,” Nicky told them, his voice firm.</p><p>Rio raised a brow, looking between him and Agatha.</p><p>“He takes his aquarium visits <em> very </em>seriously,” the brunette said with a solemn nod, but her lips turned up in a slight smirk.</p><p><em> Seriously </em> might have been an understatement. Nicky was downright passionate in his love of the aquarium and all of the creatures on display. As he led Rio and Agatha through the <em> Conservation Hall, </em>past a large tank of shimmering silver fish and large groupers, another with a bright imitation coral reef filled with bright tropical fish of every color, he pointed out all of the different species and listed facts about many of them.</p><p>
<em> Did you know that coral isn’t rock, it’s actually a living organism? </em>
</p><p>
<em> Did you know that moray eels have two sets of jaws? </em>
</p><p>
<em> Did you know that stingrays don’t lay eggs? They give birth to live babies. </em>
</p><p>Rio hung onto his every word, taking it in with wide-eyed fascination even if she already knew the fact he was telling her. It wasn’t the fish that had her fascinated— it was the boy himself. There was an intensity about him that was spellbinding, and also eerily familiar.</p><p>“Look, Rio, it’s a horseshoe crab!” Nicky’s entire face lit up as he leaned precariously over the side of the touchpool. Agatha held to the back of his sweatshirt with a practiced hand as he named every animal in the display, his arms waving wildly as he pointed to each one. It was clear that his intensity wasn’t entirely genetic— even in the brief time she had spent with them, Rio could tell that Nicky’s mannerisms were a carbon copy of Agatha’s.</p><p>Once they had seen all of the exhibits in the first building, they made their way outside to the next section of the aquarium. In one direction was an entrance beneath a large sign that read <em> Aquatheater, </em>and in the opposite direction were a series of open-air enclosures. Nicky looked between the two options, then looked intently at his watch.</p><p>“We have forty-two minutes until the show starts, so we can go see the otters first for Mama, and then we’ll go inside to see the sharks for Rio,” he declared with a nod. “And then after the show, we can go see the seahorses and the octopus.”</p><p>“Sounds like a good plan,” Agatha agreed.</p><p>“Just remember, Mama, we can’t watch the otters for long,” Nicky reminded her, frowning severely.</p><p>“Don’t act as if you don’t like the otters, too,” Agatha said, pointing an accusatory finger toward the boy.</p><p>Nicky looked between her and Rio and shrugged. “They’re cool, but not as cool as sharks.”</p><p>Agatha gasped dramatically as he took off toward the exhibit, giggling wildly. “You take that back!”</p><p>Rio chuckled at their antics as she trailed behind them. Agatha had caught up with Nicky in front of the enclosure and was tickling his sides, making him laugh even harder.</p><p>“Stop, Mama, stop!” he begged between fits of giggles.</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha said with a grin, pulling Nicky into an embrace so that his back was pressed against her front. She turned and looked at Rio. “Rio, did you know that otters have pockets?”</p><p>Rio raised a brow at her. “You’re joking.”</p><p>“Nope, they have a little flap of skin under their arms where they store food and their favorite rocks,” Agatha told her. “They save the best rocks to use for cracking open shellfish.”</p><p>“Nicky, is she being serious?” Rio demanded.</p><p>The little boy nodded. “She’s <em> very </em>serious about the otters.”</p><p>They watched the otters for several more minutes before Nicky urged them to move on. They paused for a few moments in front of the seal and sea lion enclosures— two <em> very </em>different animals, according to Nicky, but Rio failed to see a huge difference— and then they watched the penguins for a bit before going into the next building. </p><p>Again Nicky led them from display to display, looking through large walls of acrylic into massive tanks with huge varieties of sea creatures. The best part, according to Nicky— and Rio found herself agreeing— was a tunnel that passed under the tank so that they were surrounded by water above them and to their sides, and fish, sharks, and rays swam all around them. They stood in the tunnel for several minutes, just looking up.</p><p>“There!” Nicky shouted, pointing upward quickly. “The white shark!”</p><p>“Where?” Rio asked, trying to follow his pointing, but she couldn’t see it.</p><p>“He’s over here now,” Agatha said, stepping close beside her and pointing, and since she was taller it was easier to see.</p><p>“Oh, very cool,” Rio remarked, pulling her phone from her pocket and snapping a quick photo.</p><p>“I told you,” Nicky said proudly.</p><p>“Would it be okay if we took a picture together?” Rio asked, looking at Agatha and gesturing between her and Nicky.</p><p>“It’s alright with me,” Agatha replied.</p><p>Rio mouthed <em> Thank you </em>as Nicky pulled her to the side in front of the acrylic. Rio held her phone out to take a photo of the two of them, bunched together as a shark swam behind them.</p><p>“Now can we get one with Mama?” Nicky asked, looking between them.</p><p>Agatha opened and shut her mouth awkwardly, but Rio covered quickly. “Yeah, sure, we’ll make a Nicky sandwich. Get in here, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha still looked a bit shell shocked as she crouched down beside Nicky, but she hid it well as she smiled toward the camera.</p><p>“My, what a beautiful family.”</p><p>Rio looked away from the screen to see an aquarium employee, an older woman, watching them with a warm smile.</p><p>“Oh, um, we’re not—” Agatha began.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio interrupted, knowing it was too awkward to explain their exact situation to a stranger.</p><p>“I could take a photo of the three of you, so you don’t have to cram together like that,” she volunteered.</p><p>“You don’t have to—” Agatha said at the same time Rio said, “That would be wonderful.”</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha, whose cheeks were a bit flushed even in the blue light of the aquarium. She handed the woman her phone and took her position back on one side of Nicky, who looked happy as a clam at the turn of events. He reached out and took her hand, and he already held Agatha’s hand on the other side.</p><p>Rio looked up at Agatha, who still looked a bit uncomfortable that a stranger had intruded on their day.</p><p>“Smile for the camera,” Rio told her softly. “And maybe I’ll convince Nicky to go watch the otters for a bit longer.”</p><p>That actually got a small, genuine smile from Agatha, and it made Rio’s insides flutter.</p><p>“Say <em> cheese!” </em></p><p>The woman snapped several photos, and then Nicky looked at his watch and gasped.</p><p>“We’re gonna be late for the show!” he exclaimed.</p><p>“Well, we can’t have that,” the woman chuckled at his enthusiasm. She handed Rio her phone. “Enjoy the rest of your visit.”</p><p>Rio thanked her as Nicky began pulling her toward the exit. They hurried across the courtyard to the Aquatheater. Once inside, Nicky looked around before decisively leading them toward what felt like a very particular set of bleachers.</p><p>“Here is good!” he announced loudly, plopping down on the metal bleachers emphatically. “Mama, you sit on this side, and Rio, you sit here.”</p><p>Rio smiled as she and Agatha followed his directions, firmly sandwiching his smaller frame between them. His face lit up in a radiant smile, and she could almost feel him buzzing with elation beside her. Rio liked to think his eagerness wasn’t just about the show he had seen many times before, but also because he was getting to share it with her. She was certainly far more excited about watching a bunch of sea lions do tricks than she would’ve been without him.</p><p>The show began, and Rio could understand why Nicky loved it so much. A California sea lion and harbor seal raced around the pool, jumping out to grab treats thrown for them, as upbeat eighties rock played through the speakers. Next the two animals circled around and hopped up on the concrete poolside for photo opportunities as the presenting handler explained the difference between seals and sea lions. Rio looked over at Nicky to see his lips moving, quoting the script of facts along with the handler. When a five-hundred-pound sea lion burst out of the water with a splash right in front of them and roared at them, Rio squealed in surprise, and Nicky burst into riotous laughter.</p><p>“That’s why you chose this spot!” Rio accused, and Nicky just laughed even louder. Rio looked to Agatha for support, but the other woman was honest to god cackling at her. “Absolutely ridiculous.”</p><p>The short show was nearly over when Rio’s phone began ringing. She pulled it from her pocket and her eyes widened as <em> Langone Health </em>flashed up on her caller ID.</p><p>“I have to go take this,” Rio said breathlessly, flashing the phone in Agatha’s face.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened and her gleeful expression morphed into an anxious one. She masked it just as quickly, turning back to distract Nicky as Rio stood up and hurried out of the Aquatheater.</p><p>Once she was outside where she could hear over the loud music, Rio quickly answered the call. “Hello?”</p><p>“This is Hayley, Dr. Carter’s nurse, calling from Langone Health’s Transplant Institute for Rosario— excuse me, <em> Rio— </em>Vidal?”</p><p>“This is she, uh, me,” Rio said, pacing between an empty bench and a trash can.</p><p>“Okay, Miss Vidal, could you please verify your date of birth?”</p><p>“Twelve, twenty-eight, nineteen eighty-nine,” Rio replied. “And please, call me Rio.”</p><p>“Thank you, Rio,” the nurse said. “As I said before, this is Hayley, Dr. Carter’s nurse, and I’m calling with your test results. Firstly, your labs all came back within normal readings. Next, we verified that your blood type is indeed O negative, which makes you a universal donor. Then, we checked cross-matching, meaning we mixed your blood cells with the intended recipient’s serum, in this case Nicholas Harkness, to check for an immune response, and that test was negative.”</p><p>Rio’s heart fell. “Oh no…”</p><p>“Oh, no, we want a negative result for that test! It means Nicolas’s cells didn’t attack yours,” the nurse told her. “I apologize for not fully explaining…”</p><p>“No, it’s fine,” Rio said, sighing with relief. “So… so far, so good?”</p><p>“Yes, Rio,” Nurse Hayley replied. “Finally, we did tissue typing and compared your HLA type to Nicholas’s. To avoid organ rejection, we want as close to a six out of six antigen match as we can get. Biological parents will match at least three out of six, and in your case, you and Nicholas have a five out of six antigen match. With modern immunosuppressant medication, Dr. Carter believes there’s no reason such a transplant won’t be successful.”</p><p>Rio’s heart pounded even harder in her chest. “So… so I’m a match?”</p><p>Rio heard a gasp from behind her and turned to see Agatha standing behind her, staring at her with wide eyes, Nicky at her side looking confused. Rio reached toward them, and Agatha took her hand without hesitation, squeezing tightly.</p><p>“Yes, Rio, you’re a match for donation to Nicholas Harkness,” the nurse replied, her voice tinged with happiness.</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha and nodded, and tears welled up in the woman’s eyes. She squeezed Rio’s hand and hugged Nicky even tighter against her body.</p><p>“There are a few more screenings you’ll need to undergo before we can proceed with the transplant,” Hayley continued. “You’ll need to meet with one of our independent donor advocates, and they’ll help schedule you with the rest of your donation team. Their goal is to help make sure you are physically, mentally, and financially prepared to donate. This is a big decision, and you’ll have a full team on your side as well.”</p><p>“That sounds like a lot,” Rio said, glancing down at Nicky’s confused face. “I just want to get this done so Nicky can be healthy.”</p><p>“I understand that, but trust me, he’s getting the best care in the meantime,” Nurse Hayley assured her. “And, considering your preliminary test results and your caring attitude, I don’t think this process is going to be exceedingly difficult for you. It does take a bit of time, but all that is in your best interest and Nicky’s, I promise.”</p><p>“Okay, I suppose it’s all part of the process,” Rio replied. “How soon can I see this donor advocate?”</p><p>“He has an appointment on Thursday at four, actually, if you’re available,” Hayley informed her.</p><p>“I’ll be there,” Rio agreed. She would have to move some lessons around, but that wasn’t an issue. Actually she would need to speak with her advisor and supervisors at the college and inform them of all this, now that it was actually happening.</p><p>The nurse confirmed the appointment, and after a few more pleasantries, Rio disconnected the call. She looked up at Agatha with wide eyes.</p><p>“I’m a match,” she said, her voice soft with shock. “This is actually happening.”</p><p>Agatha stood a bit taller, as if bracing herself. “How do you feel about that?”</p><p>Rio looked at Nicky again, then back at Agatha. “I feel good. Yeah. I’m good.”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>Nicky pulled away from Agatha’s grasp and looked up at Rio, finally tired of being talked over. “What’s going on?”</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha, who nodded tentatively. Rio sat down on the bench so she was eye level with the boy before placing her hands on each of Nicky’s shoulders.</p><p>“That was the nurse from the transplant institute,” Rio told him. “I went a few days ago and they ran some tests to see if I might be a match to donate my kidney to you. Those results came back, and it looks like I <em> am </em> a match.”</p><p>Nicky’s brow wrinkled in thought. “So… so they’ll take your kidney and put it in me?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Basically, yeah.”</p><p>“But don’t you need it?” Nicky asked, voice concerned. “You need your kidney, Rio, it’s no fun when you don’t have a good one.”</p><p>Rio’s heart ached at Nicky’s sweetness, and she blinked back tears. “It’s okay, bud, because I have two healthy kidneys. They’re just gonna take one and give it to you, I’ll still have the other one. And people can live just fine with only one kidney. I’ll be okay.”</p><p>“You promise?” Nicky asked.</p><p>“I promise,” Rio assured him. “I just got you back in my life, bud, we’re not gonna lose each other now.”</p><p>Nicky stared at her for a long time, his brown eyes searching her face and calculating, before he suddenly moved, diving into her embrace and hugging her tightly.</p><p>“Thank you,” he said, and Rio could tell he was crying into her neck.</p><p>“You’re welcome, <em> mijo,” </em>she whispered, only realizing what she said a moment later. She looked up at Agatha hesitantly, but the other woman was also crying, and from her expression she either didn’t understand what Rio had called him or hadn't heard it. That could be a discussion later, Rio decided.</p><p>After a few long teary minutes, Nicky finally loosened his hold on Rio. He stood and turned toward Agatha before diving into her arms, hugging her just as tightly.</p><p>“Rio’s gonna make me better, Mama,” he said, looking up at her.</p><p>Agatha reached up and cradled his face with her hands, gently wiping away the streaks left by his tears with her thumbs. “She is, sweet boy. She really is.”</p><p>Rio wiped her own eyes and took a deep, sniffly breath. “There are a few more tests I have to go through, but the nurse said based on my health, those should be just fine. So it’s gonna take a little more time, but soon you’re gonna be back in tip-top shape, <em> mijo.” </em></p><p>The term slipped again, and this time Rio could tell that Agatha registered it. Her expression showed a moment of surprise before she schooled her features, so Rio wasn’t sure if she was okay with it or not. Still, the term felt <em> right </em>on Rio’s tongue and in her heart, and now that she had breathed it from her lungs she wasn’t sure if she could stop.</p><p>“Now, let’s stop this blubber fest,” Rio said, rising to her feet. “You’ve got some sea otters to see,” she pointed at Agatha. “You’ve got an octopus and a whole new seahorse exhibit to check out,” she continued, poking Nicky in the chest until he giggled. “So I think you need to continue leading this tour, tour guide. You ready to go?”</p><p>“Ready!” Nicky exclaimed, punching his fist in the air.</p><p>“Alright, <em> vamanos,” </em>Rio exclaimed, gently turning him and prodding him toward the nearby enclosure.</p><p>“Yeah, let’s go!” Nicky agreed, grabbing Rio’s hand on one side and Agatha’s with the other and leading the way.</p><p>Rio looked from the back of Nicky’s head, to Agatha’s still-watery smile, and back, and her heart swelled. This was perhaps the strangest situation she had ever found herself in, but she didn’t hate it. The road ahead of them was uncertain and full of trials, but something told Rio that they would reach the prize at the end.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Fall was Rio’s favorite time of year in the city. Sandwiched between the heated bustle of summer and the frigid festivity of winter, autumn felt slower, more relaxed, like the city took its time to breathe with each crisp breeze and falling leaf. The scent of pumpkin spice filled the air outside every coffee shop and bakery, mixing with the earthy aroma of fallen leaves. In the park the trees painted an elaborate tapestry of gold, orange, and red that filled Rio with warmth even as the air around her chilled.</p><p>There was already a crowd gathered at the soccer pitch as Rio approached. After their outing to the aquarium, Agatha had shared several of Nicky’s upcoming events, and Rio had happily added them to her already-full calendar. This morning was his last soccer game of the season. She had played a gig late the night before, and barely gotten any sleep, and now she was running behind, but she hoped the offering of hot coffee would make up for it. </p><p>She paused at the edge of the field, her eyes finding Nicky gathered at the opposite side with the rest of his team in their black jerseys, waiting for the match to start. As if he could feel her gaze on him, he looked her way, and when his eyes landed on her he waved brightly. Rio smiled and raised her coffee-filled hands a bit in greeting. Another boy elbowed Nicky and he turned his attention back to the coach.</p><p>Rio looked around in the crowd and found Agatha sitting in a purple folding chair, in deep conversation with a red-haired woman. She made her way around the pitch, weaving through the gathered parents, until she finally joined them.</p><p>“Good morning,” Agatha greeted, looking up at her. “Glad you could finally join us.”</p><p>Agatha looked the most casual Rio had ever seen her, in a navy sweater, loose-fitting gray trousers, and white sneakers. Something about the color of the sweater made her eyes pop even more than usual. Three silver chains of different lengths hung around her neck, and when she reached up and tucked her hair behind her ear, it revealed at least six different piercings that Rio had never noticed before, and she had the sudden urge to run her tongue—</p><p>“I come bearing coffee,” Rio said, quickly banishing those thoughts as she offered her one of the cups.</p><p>Agatha looked genuinely surprised as she took the cup from her. “You didn’t have to do that.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio replied. “But I thought it was only fair. I hope you like pumpkin spice.”</p><p>“Oh, she loves pumpkin spice, she just won’t admit it,” the redhead interjected. “I’m Wanda, by the way.”</p><p>Now that she was closer, Rio recognized her: Wanda Maximoff, actress and, according to Google, Agatha’s former lover.</p><p>“I’m, uh, Rio,” she replied, shaking the hand that the redhead held toward her. “I’m Agatha’s, um… Well, I’m Nicky’s…”</p><p>“Nicky’s birthmom, Agatha’s filled me in on the situation,” Wanda finished for her. She turned to Agatha. “Aren’t you going to offer her a chair? Or did I listen to you whine about carrying an extra the whole way here for nothing?”</p><p>“Right,” Agatha said, placing her coffee in the cup holder. “I brought you a chair.”</p><p>Sure enough, a third chair was leaning against Agatha’s. Rio quickly turned her attention to setting it up, but the entire time her thoughts were racing. What was Wanda Maximoff doing here with Agatha? Was she <em> with Agatha? </em>Rio remembered the headlines vividly, the ones speculating if Wanda had left her husband for Agatha. That had been at least five years ago, but maybe they had some on-again-off-again thing going.</p><p>“Agatha tells me Nicky got his athleticism from you,” Wanda said once Rio had sat down beside Agatha. The redhead was clearly oblivious to Rio’s inner turmoil.</p><p>“Seems that way,” Rio replied.</p><p>“That’s my boys, too,” Wanda continued. “They got their athleticism from their dad.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “I’ve seen you dance, Wands. You at least passed on some innate sense of balance and grace. Meanwhile, if Nicky were biologically mine, I’m not even sure Rio’s natural talent could’ve combatted my clumsiness.”</p><p>The two women laughed and Rio joined in awkwardly, but her mind was stuck on what Agatha had called the other woman. She had a nickname for her, for Christ’s sake.</p><p>“Well, Billy and Tommy aren’t into dancing, so I guess I’m lucky that I met Nat,” Wanda said, smiling fondly as she looked across the pitch.</p><p>Rio followed Wanda’s gaze to where another redhead, the team’s coach, was crouched down and whispering to Nicky on the sidelines. She was still confused about the entire dynamic she had stumbled into, but her attention was quickly diverted as Nicky was subbed in for another boy on the team.</p><p>“I’m so glad Nicky was able to finish out the season,” Wanda remarked fondly.</p><p>“Me too, he’s still upset that he won’t be able to play basketball. But if all goes according to plan, he’ll be recovered enough for baseball season,” Agatha told her.</p><p>Rio watched as Nicky ran onto the pitch, high-fiving a couple of players as he went. When the referee blew the whistle and his teammate kicked the ball inbounds, he quickly ran into position so that when the ball made it down the field he was open for a kick. He dribbled around the defensive player before kicking the ball into the goal, just out of reach of the goalie.</p><p>Rio stood and cheered loudly, her whistles carrying over the claps from the other parents. Beside her Agatha cheered as well, though she was a bit more restrained, having seen the same thing before.</p><p>“Did you see that?” Rio asked dumbly, her smile wide as she sat back down.</p><p>“I told you he’s good,” Agatha replied smugly.</p><p>“I think he’s showing off a bit,” Wanda remarked. “Probably because he knows you’re here.”</p><p>The team moved into a defensive position, and it was clear that Nicky had a good eye for where each player would be and where the ball was going. As the other team worked their way down the field, he tried to intercept a pass, but it was just a bit too quick for him. The other team attempted to score, only for the goalie to stop the ball. The girl tossed it back out and the back and forth began again.</p><p>“Which ones are your boys?” Rio asked Wanda, her eyes still on Nicky as he ran.</p><p>“Billy’s number six and Tommy’s number nine,” Wanda replied, her tone and facial expression entirely humorless. “Billy chose the number six because he says it’s a magic number. And Tommy chose the number nine because he thinks he’s funny.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip to stifle her laughter. Beside her, Agatha cackled freely.</p><p>“Ask her how long it took for her to realize what they had done,” the brunette managed to say through her laughter.</p><p>“I didn’t realize it until after they had taken team pictures,” Wanda said. “I requested shots of them together. And Tommy made sure they were standing in the right order. So now I have a photo of them in my house with the number sixty-nine in bright white lettering on their jerseys.”</p><p>Beside her, Agatha snorted, and that made Rio lose control of her own laughter. She looked back at the field, her eyes searching for Wanda’s sons. Number six was playing as goalkeeper, and number nine was zipping across the pitch as a midfielder. Nicky, however, was back on the sidelines.</p><p>“Did Nicky get benched?” Rio asked.</p><p>“He gets tired easily,” Agatha told her. “It’s one of the symptoms of kidney failure. The first one I noticed, actually. Thankfully Natasha has been really great about reading his body language and making him sit out when he needs to, while still allowing him to play with the team.”</p><p>The score was tied three to three when refs called halftime. The players circled around their coaches momentarily before running to their parents for water. Wanda reached for a cooler between her and Agatha’s chairs and had it open when all three boys came running up.</p><p>“Gatorades and bottled waters for everybody,” the redhead announced, and the twins immediately went digging into the cooler.</p><p>Nicky, however, tackled Rio in a tight hug.</p><p>“Rio!” he exclaimed.</p><p>“Nicky!” Rio exclaimed in reply as she hugged him back. “Nice goal, by the way, <em> mijo.”</em></p><p>“Thanks,” Nicky grinned, standing back up. He then sat on Agatha’s lap and reached over into the cooler.</p><p>“Ew! Stinky sweaty boy touching me,” Agatha teased.</p><p>“I don’t stink,” Nicky argued, sniffing himself. “I put on deodorant, just like you said.”</p><p>“Isn’t he a little young to need deodorant?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Boy mom rule number one: they are <em> never </em>too young for deodorant,” Wanda told her. “Tommy, Billy, this is Nicky’s birthmom, Rio. I told you about her, remember?”</p><p>“Hello,” Billy greeted, waving at her with the hand not holding his Gatorade.</p><p>“Hi,” Tommy said, face pinched in thought. “So you’re Nicky’s real mom?”</p><p>Rio could feel Agatha tense beside her.</p><p><em> “Birthmom, </em>Tommy, we’ve been over this,” Wanda corrected.</p><p>“Rio and Mama are both my real moms,” Nicky said simply. “Rio’s my real birthmom, and Mama’s my real Mama. Rio carried me inside her and gave birth to me, but Mama takes care of me and loves me and makes sure I have everything I need. Right, Mama?”</p><p>“That’s right,” Agatha replied, but her tone was still a bit terse.</p><p>“Having two moms is cool,” Billy commented. “We’ll have two moms if Mom and Nat get married.”</p><p>“Mom and Nat aren’t gonna get married,” Tommy argued. “And even if they do, Nat won’t be our mom, she’ll be our stepmom. But we’ll still only have one mom.”</p><p>“Okay boys, that’s enough,” Wanda interrupted. “We’ll discuss this at home.”</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha, trying to ignore the awkward family dynamics in front of her, but the other woman wouldn’t meet her eyes. Instead Rio looked at Nicky.</p><p>“You feeling okay?” she asked.</p><p>“I feel great,” he replied. “Coach said she might let me try playing sweeper in the second half.”</p><p>“That’s a really important position,” Rio noted.</p><p>“Yeah, I know. Coach thinks I’ll be good at it,” he told her.</p><p>The ref blew a whistle to signal that halftime was almost over. The boys hurried back across the pitch to their coach, who gave them a quick pep talk before sending them out on the field.</p><p>“So you’re dating the coach?” Rio asked, looking back at Wanda.</p><p>“Yep, we’ve been seeing each other for a few months now,” Wanda replied. “Billy’s been very accepting of it, but Tommy’s been a little more reserved. He loves Nat as his coach, but… He had a harder time with the divorce than Billy did, so I’m not surprised he’s having a harder time seeing me with someone new, too.”</p><p>“He’ll get there,” Agatha assured her. “It took him a while to come around to me when we got together, too, but now he has no issue with you dating women.”</p><p>“I’m sorry about what he said,” Wanda said. “I’ve explained the situation to them. But, as you’ve probably figured out by now, Tommy has a hard time with change and with things that don’t fit into his understanding of the world. He’s a lot like his father that way, views everything as black and white.”</p><p>“It’s okay, really,” Agatha replied, but her lips were still drawn, her shoulders tense. What Tommy said had shaken her, and Rio wished she could reassure her, but she wasn’t sure how.</p><p>Instead she looked at Wanda and shrugged. “They’re kids. And it is a confusing situation, so I understand why he’s struggling. But like Agatha said, he’ll get there.”</p><p>“It sounds like Nicky’s adjusting well, though,” Wanda remarked.</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha, hoping she would agree, but she just hummed noncommittally, her eyes on the players. Rio followed her lead and turned her attention to the game. With the score tied, the players seemed more intense in this half. For a bunch of nine- and ten-year-olds, they were all very competitive. In the first few minutes of the second half, Nicky’s team scored once, but their opponents scored twice. Rio could tell that Billy was growing disheartened in the net.</p><p>Finally Nicky was subbed in, and almost immediately he stole the ball from the opposing team, made his way down the field, and passed it to Tommy who scored. The mischievous boy gave him a fist bump before Nicky ran down field into defensive position. As the other team got closer to the goal, Nicky forced the girl who had scored earlier to pass to another player, and Billy was able to block that boy’s shot.</p><p>Nicky was pulled for another short break on the sidelines, but the opposing team quickly got two shots in quick succession. The coach whispered something to Nicky before subbing him in once again with just a few minutes left of the game.</p><p>The score was five to seven, with just under five minutes left to play. The opposing team got the ball, and Tommy and another player forced them out of bounds. Nicky kicked the ball inbounds to a teammate, she passed it to Tommy, who made his way down the field quickly and scored. Nicky moved into position in front of the goal, and the players all moved down the field. A player kicked toward the goal and Nicky blocked it, kicking the ball toward another player on his team. He and his teammate made their way back down the field, kicking the ball between them to dodge the opposing team’s players.</p><p>Rio stood to her feet as they got closer to the goal, and beside her Agatha and Wanda did the same. The players were in a tighter formation now, and Rio could tell Nicky was struggling to find a path to the goal or to pass to a teammate.</p><p>What happened next was so fast that Rio barely saw it. A boy on the opposing team, who was a full head taller and much stouter build than Nicky, went for the ball, only to get his legs twisted with Nicky’s. The two boys fell to the ground in a heap, with the larger boy landing on top of Nicky. The ref blew her whistle and the other players froze as the coaches ran onto the field. Before they could even reach them the other boy had rolled to the side and was getting to his feet, but Nicky wasn’t getting up.</p><p>“Nicky,” Agatha breathed, starting to run onto the field, but Rio grabbed her arm.</p><p>“I’m sure he’s fine,” she said, trying to assure her. “The coaches can handle it.”</p><p>“Let me go,” Agatha hissed, fighting against Rio’s hold.</p><p>“Agatha—”</p><p>Agatha yanked her arm away from Rio and charged out onto the field. Rio followed, her legs seeming to move of their own volition. By the time they made it to Nicky, the coach had already gotten him up on his feet, but he was favoring one leg.</p><p>“Nicky, are you okay?” Agatha asked, reaching for him.</p><p>“I’m fine, Mama,” he said, but when he took a step he limped.</p><p>“I don’t think anything’s broken,” Nat told her. “Might be a sprained ankle.”</p><p>“See, he’s fine,” Rio said, but Agatha acted like she wasn’t even there.</p><p>“We’ll get you to the hospital to get it checked out just to make sure,” Agatha told Nicky.</p><p>“Mooooooom,” Nicky groaned, more in annoyance than pain.</p><p>“Agatha, he’s fine,” Rio scoffed.</p><p>“Nobody asked you!” Agatha exclaimed, turning to Rio ferociously. Her face was drawn with worry, her blue eyes sharp with gathering tears.</p><p>“Agatha—” Rio began softly, reaching toward her to try and calm her down.</p><p>“You’re not his mother!” Agatha shouted, and her words cut through Rio like a knife. Rio’s outstretched hand dropped and she looked at Agatha with wide eyes.</p><p>“Mama—” Nicky said softly, trying to get her attention, but her eyes stayed fixed on Rio.</p><p>“You are <em> not </em> his mother,” Agatha repeated, her voice softer but even more venomous.</p><p>Rio could hear her pulse pounding in her ears, could feel the eyes of everyone at the pitch on them as her world came crashing down around her. She swallowed, trying to fight her tears as she looked at Nicky, meeting his frightened eyes, before looking back at Agatha.</p><p>“You’re right,” she said, her voice low. She nodded her head as she repeated herself a bit louder. “I’m sorry, I— You’re right.”</p><p>“Rio, no!” Nicky said, trying to get to his feet but stumbling on his injured leg.</p><p>“It’s okay, Nicky,” she said. “Listen to your mama.”</p><p>She turned quickly, making her way back to the sidelines, ignoring Nicky calling her name behind her. She grabbed her bag and the empty coffee cup as quickly as she could.</p><p>“She didn’t mean it, Rio,” Wanda told her, reaching out, but Rio moved away before she could touch her.</p><p>“She’s right, though. I’m not his mother. I’m not… anything,” Rio said, wiping the tears from her eyes. “Tell them I’ll see them whenever the transplant team says we’re ready to move forward with the surgery.”</p><hr/><p> </p><p>There was a crack in the ceiling. Rio’s eyes traced the faint line as she laid on her back in bed, noting the slight shadows around it. She’d have to tell Alice, and Alice would have to report it to maintenance. They’d probably kick her out of her room for two or three days just to slap some plaster over it and call it fixed. Hell, she could do that by herself, all she’d have to do was watch a couple of youtube videos and order the supplies online.</p><p>Rio sighed and the woman between her thighs took that as a good sign, humming slightly as she licked between her folds.</p><p><em> Oh, right. </em> Rio wasn’t supposed to be thinking about repairing the ceiling. She should be focused on the fact that a woman was eating her out.</p><p>When Rio left the soccer match, she had wanted nothing more than a distraction, something that would make it impossible to think, if only for a little while, and since she didn’t drink, the next best thing was sex. She had scrolled through her phone until she came to a familiar contact— a capital H followed by a skull and a green heart. Hela was always up for a good time, no strings attached, no questions asked, so Rio had dialed her number. Rio had barely had enough time to change her sheets before the woman was in her apartment, stripping off her clothes, and making herself comfortable between her legs.</p><p>“You like that, baby?” Hela asked, flicking her clit with the tip of her tongue as she looked up at Rio with blue eyes.</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio muttered, reaching down to twist her hand in the woman’s hair and pull her back to her. She closed her eyes, trying to focus. She didn’t want to think, she just wanted to feel, and yet her mind wouldn’t stop.</p><p>
<em> I should’ve just gone to the studio. I should’ve taken this tank top off, it keeps rolling up under my back. Oh that feels good… but she stopped. Should I tell her to do that again? No, just… This is fine. If she just keeps… How long have we been doing this? Her jaw is probably tired. Fuck, what time is it?</em>
</p><p>Rio turned her head to look at the alarm clock on her nightstand. It was four-thirty, and they had been like this for a good twenty minutes. Rio looked back at the ceiling, assessing her body.</p><p>“This isn’t working,” she said after a moment, sitting up. Hela sat up as well, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand.</p><p>“Do you want to try something else?” she asked.</p><p>“No, just… don’t worry about it,” Rio replied, opening her nightstand drawer and contemplating her options. At least one of them deserved to orgasm. She pulled her strap out and began pulling it over her legs. “You cool with this?”</p><p>“Mmm, you know it,” Hela said, turning to lie on her back as Rio finished tightening the straps around her hips.</p><p>“Get on your hands and knees,” Rio ordered, grabbing a bottle of lube from the dresser and covering the silicone cock with it. Once she was slick and the woman on her bed was in position, Rio moved behind her.</p><p>Hela moaned as Rio bottomed out inside her, and whined as she pulled back out. Rio huffed and splayed her hand flat between the woman’s shoulder blades, forcing her face deeper into the pillows, before picking up a steady pace. The woman beneath her continued to moan and cry out into the pillows, the pitch climbing as she got closer to orgasm. Rio angled the strap precisely with each thrust, until Hela started trembling beneath her, the muscles in her ass and thighs shaking as she got closer.</p><p>Rio grabbed at a handful of dark hair, tangling her fist in it and tugging the woman’s head back.</p><p>“Touch your clit and make yourself come,” Rio told her. Hela did as she was told, reaching beneath her body to roughly touch herself. A few moments later she cried out, a high keening sound that was sure to earn another noise complaint from the neighbors. Rio slowed the rolling of her hips, only coming to a stop once the woman’s thighs stopped shaking. The brunette collapsed on her stomach on Rio’s mattress, breathing deeply and letting out contented sighs that made Rio’s eye twitch.</p><p>Rio unbuckled the harness from her hips and pulled her underwear back on.</p><p>“Don’t get too comfortable,” she warned, stepping out of the room to wash the dildo in the bathroom sink. When she was done with that she returned to the bedroom, but not to the bed. She pulled her macbook from her bag and set it up on the nightstand before taking her guitar from its case and checking the tuning.</p><p>“So you’re not going to—” Hela asked.</p><p>“No, you can get dressed and go,” Rio said, playing a few chords in quick succession.</p><p>Hela shrugged and began dressing. Once she was put together, she stepped out and used the bathroom.</p><p>“Hello, Alice,” Hela greeted in the hallway.</p><p>“Fuck off, Hela,” Alice replied from the living room.</p><p>Hela returned from the bathroom, chuckling at Alice’s response. She picked up her purse and bent over to press a kiss to Rio’s cheek.</p><p>“Feel free to call me if you need to blow off some more steam,” she said, and Rio gave a noncommittal hum. “I’ll see myself out.”</p><p>As soon as Hela was out of the apartment, Alice appeared in the doorway.</p><p>“What the fuck was that?”</p><p>“That was Hela, I believe you’ve met,” Rio replied.</p><p>“Are you drunk?” Alice asked.</p><p>“What?” Rio exclaimed. “Of course not.”</p><p>“Or are you high? Because last time you ended things with Hela, you almost fell off the wagon.”</p><p>“I’m not drunk or high,” Rio scowled. “I just needed to get my mind off some things for a bit, and Hela’s always up for a good time.”</p><p>“Always up for a little bit too good of a time, if you ask me,” Alice retorted. “She’s bad news, Rio.”</p><p>“I know you don’t like her. You’ve made that abundantly clear,” Rio remarked.</p><p>“I don't like her because she always brings you down! Every time you two are together, you always say <em>no strings attached, </em>you end up catching feelings, and she breaks you. It's messy and toxic as fuck.” Alice’s eyes narrowed, her entire demeanor changing. “What the hell happened at that soccer game?</p><p>Rio laid back on her bed with a huff. “I don’t wanna talk about it.”</p><p>“That bad, huh?” Alice said. “Well, that explains why your phone’s been going off all afternoon.”</p><p>Rio sat up again. “What?”</p><p>“Yeah, you left your phone— and your pants— on the living room floor,” Alice said. Rio quickly stood up and squeezed past her, making her way to the living room where she picked up her pants. “You’ve been getting notifications and calls for the last hour but I didn’t want to interrupt whatever you had going on. Had I known it was Hela, I would have.”</p><p>Rio ignored Alice as she fished her phone out of her pants pocket and unlocked her screen to a dozen texts and even more missed calls, all from one contact: <em> Agatha Harkness. </em></p><p>“Nicky fell during the game, probably sprained his ankle, and Agatha flipped out,” Rio explained, pulling up Agatha’s number to call her back. “I tried to calm her down, but she got mad and shouted that I’m not his mother in the middle of the soccer pitch.”</p><p>“That bitch,” Alice seethed, crossing her arms angrily.</p><p>“I mean, she’s not wrong, Alice,” Rio said as she pressed the screen to dial. “I gave up my rights to him when he was born. She’s allowing me back into his life, and I overstepped.”</p><p>“You’re giving him a kidney!” Alice exclaimed. “Doesn’t that count for something?”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to argue with her friend, but at that same moment Agatha answered on the other end of the line.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Hey, Agatha, how’s Nicky?” Rio asked.</p><p>“He’s not with you?” Agatha asked, voice rising with panic.</p><p>Rio froze. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Is Nicky with you?” Agatha asked, her tone accusatory but mixed with absolute terror.</p><p>“No, he’s not with me,” Rio replied. “What’s going on?”</p><p>On the other end of the line, Agatha made a sound like a wounded animal. Rio immediately stood and began yanking her clothes back on, placing the phone on speaker as she did so.</p><p>“I took him to the hospital and they confirmed that his ankle was just sprained,” Agatha explained. “He was so angry. When we got back to the apartment he went to his room and closed the door, and I started making dinner, but when I called him down, he didn’t answer. I checked his room a little while ago and he’s not there, he snuck out while I was busy in the kitchen. He left his phone in his room, so I can’t track where he is.”</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio muttered, sliding her feet into her shoes. “Have you called the police?”</p><p>“I called Clint and his team, they’re working on it,” Agatha replied.</p><p>“Clint? I thought Clint was your driver?”</p><p>“Clint is private security, Rio,” Agatha told her. “They don’t have much to go on, but I think one of his teammates is heading to your apartment.”</p><p>“Alice can meet them here,” Rio said, looking at her friend, who nodded. “And maybe someone should stay close to my office on campus, that’s where he found me the first time.”</p><p>“I don’t know where else he would’ve gone,” Agatha said, her voice frantic and frustrated. “He’s never done anything like this, not until—”</p><p>Her voice cut off, but Rio could finish her sentence well enough: <em> Not until he met me. </em></p><p>“Rio,” Alice said softly. “Where would you have gone?”</p><p>“Huh?” Rio asked.</p><p>“If something like this happened to you when you were a kid, where would you go?” Alice asked again.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes as she thought. As a child, when her emotions felt overwhelming, she would do one of two things: find somewhere quiet where she could play her music, or go outside where she could play some kind of sport and burn off her energy. She hadn’t actually changed much as an adult, when she thought about it. And Nicky was so similar to her…</p><p>“Meet me at the park,” Rio told Agatha. “He’s back at the soccer pitch.”</p><p>“How do you—” Agatha sputtered.</p><p>“Just trust me, okay?” Rio said. “If you have any better ideas then go there, but I’m going to the park. If he’s there and you’re not, I’ll make sure he gets home.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence on the other end of the line, and then, “I’ll meet you there.”</p><p>Rio nodded, even though Agatha couldn’t see it. <em> “Te veo.” </em></p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The sun was beginning to set when Rio returned to the park. Two black SUVs were already parked at the curb, and Rio recognized Clint leaning against the side of one. He didn’t appear panicked, so she let herself breathe for a moment, giving him a small wave as she made her way through the gate. As she crested the top of the hill, she could see a small, solitary figure on the soccer pitch. Nicky was on crutches, and he used them and his good foot to knock the soccer ball around and into the net. Rio felt the rest of the tension bleed out of her at the sight of him.</p><p>A steady metallic squeak drew her attention, and she turned to see another familiar figure on the nearby swingset. Agatha looked the same as she had that morning, but as Rio drew closer she could see that her eyes were tired and red-rimmed from crying.</p><p>“No coffee this time?” Agatha asked as she approached.</p><p>“I’m afraid not,” Rio replied, sitting on the swing beside her. Agatha didn’t look at her, instead keeping her eyes on the boy below them. Rio followed her gaze and sighed. “Have you talked to him yet?”</p><p>“No, but he knows I’m here,” Agatha said. “I’m trying very hard to be patient and give him space to work through his emotions before I ground him until he’s thirty.”</p><p>Rio felt a grin tugging at the corners of her lips. “How’s that going for you?”</p><p>“It’s terrible and I hate it,” Agatha huffed, crossing her arms in irritation. “I suppose I only have myself to blame; I’m not exactly the best at dealing with my emotions. I tend to run when things get overwhelming. Combine that with your need for physical activity and here we are. That said, he’s got until the streetlights come on and then we’re going home, emotional regulation be damned.”</p><p>They sat for a few minutes in silence, as the air around them chilled and the light took on a golden hue. Finally, Rio couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p>“I’m so—”</p><p>“I think—”</p><p>They both halted mid-sentence, turning and looking at each other with wide, startled eyes before smiling awkwardly.</p><p>“You go,” Agatha said, kicking her feet so that she swayed slightly in the swing. The metal chain began its soft squeaking again, and Rio found it oddly comforting.</p><p>“Is he okay?” she asked, nodding toward Nicky.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha replied with a sigh. “It’s just a minor sprain. Nat was right. <em> You </em>were right. And I… overreacted.”</p><p>“You were scared,” Rio acknowledged. “You’ve been through a lot with his health recently and—”</p><p>“Rio, I appreciate what you’re trying to say, but fear for his health was just a tiny part of what caused me to lash out today,” Agatha told her. “The bigger part stemmed from my own issues and insecurities.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, surprised by Agatha’s candidness. “Well, um, either way, I’m sorry if I overstepped. I should’ve known telling you to calm down would have the opposite effect.”</p><p>“It wasn’t just that,” Agatha sighed. “I was already on edge. I feel like I’ve been on edge ever since the day you showed up in my apartment. And then little Toby—”</p><p><em> “Tommy,” </em>Rio corrected.</p><p>“Whatever,” Agatha huffed. “He said what he said.” She let out a dry, humorless laugh. “I’m forty years old, for fuck’s sake, and I let the words of a ten year old get under my skin. It’s pathetic.”</p><p>Rio shifted in the vinyl swing, hands gripping the chains as she braced herself for what she was about to say. “If it’s too much, I can go. We can go back to no contact. I’ll still donate my kidney, but it can just be a closed adoption again, if that’s what you want.”</p><p>“There’s no going back to that now. Nicky would be devastated,” Agatha said firmly.</p><p>“But if it’s what’s best for you, if it’s what you want—”</p><p>“It’s not,” Agatha said quickly. Rio didn’t believe her and shot her a skeptical look. Agatha sighed. “When I first looked into adoption, I was okay with it being open. It seemed less traumatic for the child and the birth mother. But when Nicky became available and it was a closed adoption, I was… <em> relieved. </em>Relieved because he wouldn’t have someone else to compare me to, relieved that he wouldn’t have this other person in his head to wonder what his life would’ve been like with her as his mother instead.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, the chain of her swing twisting and twirling as she did.</p><p>“I’m not good at sharing,” she said, nose wrinkling. “But I knew when I decided to contact you about donating a kidney that I was opening Pandora’s box, so to speak. I knew that once we met you, I would have to deal with this very real person, not the faceless figure that was in my mind for all these years. Part of me hoped you were horrible, that I could justify keeping Nicky away from you, or that he would want nothing to do with you. But that’s not the case: you’re a great person, and Nicky, well, he thinks the sun shines out your ass.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “That’s just because I’m shiny and new to him, still mostly unknown. It’ll wear off.”</p><p>“I don’t think it will, and I don’t think it’s just novelty,” Agatha argued. “You relate to him in so many ways already, in ways that I try to but often struggle with. He needs that. And just because it’s hard for me to deal with my own emotional baggage and insecurities doesn’t mean I want you out of our lives.”</p><p>Before Rio could think of what else to say, the streetlights flickered on. A shadow fell across them, and they both turned to see Nicky there, leaning on his crutches, a look of trepidation on his face.</p><p>“Are you still mad at Rio?” he asked, looking at Agatha.</p><p>“No, sweet boy, I’m not,” Agatha assured him.</p><p>Nicky squirmed nervously. “Are you mad at <em> me?” </em></p><p>Agatha stood with a sigh, and Rio followed suit. Agatha reached for Nicky, taking his face between her hands and kissing his forehead.</p><p>“Don’t you ever— <em> ever— </em>do anything like this again. This is twice in a month that you’ve gone off without telling me where you’re going or taking an adult with you. That’s not safe, Nicky, and you’re incredibly lucky that nothing bad has happened to you.”</p><p>“You <em> are </em>mad,” Nicky muttered.</p><p>“I was terrified,” Agatha corrected him. “I would lose my mind if anything happened to you, Nicholas Harkness. I don’t even want to think about it. So I need you to make better choices. Even when you’re mad or scared and you know talking about it is going to be hard, you have to tell me things instead of going off on your own. Do you understand me?”</p><p>“Yes, Mama,” he replied. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and she kissed his forehead again. Her eyes then flickered to Rio. “You scared Rio, too. I think she also deserves an apology.”</p><p>Nicky turned to her. “I’m sorry that I scared you, Rio.”</p><p>“Apology accepted,” Rio replied. “But I second what your mama said. You’re a smart kid, but you have to make safer choices in the future, okay?”</p><p>“Okay,” he agreed with a nod. He looked from Rio to Agatha and back again. “You’re not going away, are you? We can still see each other and do things together, right?”</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” Rio assured him. “Right, Agatha?”</p><p>“That’s right,” Agatha agreed.</p><p>“Good,” Nicky said before dropping his crutches and hugging her tightly. He buried his face in her shirt, and Rio reached up and ran her fingers through his hair. Suddenly Nicky pulled back and wrinkled his nose in disgust. “Ugh, why do you smell like that?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened in confusion. “Smell like what?”</p><p>“Really gross perfume,” Nicky said, gagging dramatically. “It smells even worse than Aunt Jen’s candles.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flushed with embarrassment. She could feel Agatha’s gaze on her, and she endeavored to look anywhere besides her eyes.</p><p>“Oh, you know, trying something new,” she said, pulling her flannel tighter around her.</p><p>“I don’t like it,” Nicky declared, nose still scrunched.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio agreed. “I don’t think I like it either.”</p>

<p>
<span>“I don’t think I’ve ever been around this many children before in my life, and I’m pretty sure I never want to be around this many children ever again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes at Alice’s complaint. Alice wasn’t wrong— the elementary school hallway was full of children rushing from one room to the next. It was the school’s annual fall festival, but the event had been moved inside the school due to rain. Different activities were set up in various classrooms all around the school, but the main attraction was in the auditorium.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Beside her Alice yelped, dodging yet another child, this one holding an open soda can in one hand and an overflowing bag of popcorn in the other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A whole hallway to run in and somehow they can’t miss me,” Alice grumbled, tugging her jacket around herself irritably. “And where are the responsible adults?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Relax, crazy lady, this is supposed to be a fun event,” Rio reminded her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You owe me a candy apple,” Alice told her, poking her for good measure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, yeah,” Rio scoffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seriously, you owe me,” Alice continued. “You need somebody to chaperone whenever you’re around Nicky and his mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Rio said, crossing her arms defensively.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice rolled her eyes. </span>
<em>
<span>“Agatha is the benefactor of the aquarium. Agatha’s such an amazing mom. Agatha’s favorite animal is the sea otter, she’s so cute. Agatha…”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god, stop, I do not sound like that,” Rio huffed. “I may have said all those things, but I was just stating facts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So her being cute is a fact,” Alice teased.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Yes. </span>
</em>
<span>“No. That was a slip of the tongue. I meant to say that the otters were cute.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh-huh, sure, Jan.” Alice tugged Rio out of the way of a paper airplane as it zipped past their heads.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Also, I said those things while also talking about Nicky, which you seem to have conveniently forgotten,” Rio pointed out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I haven’t forgotten, that’s another reason I’m here,” Alice told her. “I want to see if your offspring is really as amazing as you say he is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t call him my offspring,” Rio sighed. “It sounds like you’re talking about a wild animal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Any child of yours has to be at least semi-feral. And since you’ve told me not to call him your son—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because he’s not my son, he’s Agatha’s,” Rio interjected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, right,” Alice nodded. “So it was either </span>
<em>
<span>offspring </span>
</em>
<span>or </span>
<em>
<span>spawn, </span>
</em>
<span>or maybe </span>
<em>
<span>crotch goblin, </span>
</em>
<span>and I thought offspring sounded like the least-offensive option.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god, I can’t take you anywhere,” Rio muttered, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Could you please </span>
<em>
<span>try </span>
</em>
<span>to behave today? Agatha’s still kind of cagey when it comes to letting me be around Nicky, so…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re giving the kid a freaking kidney,” Alice said pointedly. “I feel like that should earn you lifetime visitation rights.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not how this works,” Rio said with a frown.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then how does it work, exactly?” Alice pressed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glared at her. They had had this conversation multiple times over the past week, always ending at the same impasse. It wasn’t that Alice wasn’t supportive of Rio donating her kidney; she understood Rio’s motivation, openly praised her selflessness, and had promised to be there to help Rio as she went through the donation process and the post-op recovery. But Alice was a pragmatist, and she always thought steps ahead of Rio, which was one reason their friendship was so strong. Alice wondered what would happen after Rio donated her kidney, when Agatha and Nicky didn’t need anything from Rio, especially after what had happened at Nicky’s soccer game.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m just worried about you,” Alice said softly, bumping Rio’s shoulder and pulling her back out of her thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed. “Yeah, I know. And I wish I could tell you that it’s going to be fine. Unfortunately, I don’t know that… </span>
<em>
<span>can’t </span>
</em>
<span>know that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But?” Alice pressed, sensing it coming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to know him,” Rio told her. “Even if it’s just for a little bit, even if it all comes crashing down one of these days… I don’t care. I can’t close things off now just because I’m afraid it might hurt later. I want to— </span>
<em>
<span>need to </span>
</em>
<span>spend time with him, and get to know him, and love him, for as long as I can. Okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice nodded. “Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sniffled and realized her eyes had teared up a bit. She wiped them quickly, careful not to smear her eyeliner, then checked her watch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, crap, we’re gonna be late!” she exclaimed, looking around frantically. “Which way is the auditorium?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was already a crowd gathered when they reached the cafetorium— a weird combination auditorium/cafeteria. Rio stood on her tiptoes, peering over the waiting audience, until her eyes landed on a familiar head of brunette waves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There they are,” she announced, tugging Alice by her arm down the aisle between chairs.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“They?” </span>
</em>
<span>Alice inquired.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>They </span>
</em>
<span>were Lilia Calderu and Jennifer Kale, Agatha’s colleagues at </span>
<em>
<span>Tarot </span>
</em>
<span>and two of the older woman’s best friends. And </span>
<em>
<span>they </span>
</em>
<span>were the real reason Rio had invited Alice along on this excursion. When Agatha had told her that the two were coming to see Nicky’s school chorus perform, Rio had asked if she could bring a friend of her own to the event. One reason, and the reason she had told Agatha, was that Alice had been there when Rio was pregnant and when Nicky was born, and she really wanted her best friend to meet the boy. The other reason, and the one she hadn’t said out loud but was fairly certain that Agatha had clocked anyway, was for her own emotional support.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She also knew Alice had been nursing a slight crush on Jennifer Kale ever since that night at the gala, and she was dying to see where that might lead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi,” Rio greeted brightly as she joined the trio, pulling Alice along behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi yourself,” Agatha replied, looking her up and down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For once Rio didn’t feel underdressed around the other woman, having come to the festival straight from teaching classes, so she was in neat tan slacks and a brown houndstooth blazer. Agatha was in a burgundy sweater with a pleated flowing skirt, and something about the entire ensemble made her look softer around the edges than Rio was used to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is Alice,” Rio said quickly, tugging Alice to her side. “Alice Wu-Gulliver, Agatha Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello,” Alice said, waving awkwardly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah, yes, I remember you, the pianist,” Agatha said, extending her hand to shake Alice’s. “You play beautifully.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, so you heard me playing?” Alice asked, her voice dripping with sarcasm as she shook her hand. “I would’ve thought you were too busy fu—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hahahaha, funny,” Rio fake laughed loudly, slapping Alice’s shoulder. “</span>
<em>
<span>Anyway, </span>
</em>
<span>who do we have here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jennifer Kale, you can call her Jen,” Agatha introduced, pointing to one woman and then the other. “And Lilia Calderu.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah, yes, the musicians, I remember,” Lilia said, looking between the two of them. “Although it seems you two are more connected than we knew, hmm?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Connected is one way to put it,” Jen said in a low voice, and Rio didn’t miss how Agatha hip-checked her. Jen ignored her friend, instead moving to stand beside Alice and striking up a conversation a few feet away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, crap, there’s two of them now,” Agatha muttered, rolling her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I had a feeling they’d get along like a house on fire,” Rio agreed. “That might be dangerous for our health, both physical and mental.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, Agatha tells us that you’re working on your PhD in music?” Lilia interrupted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s right,” Rio replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You must be so proud of Nicky, then,” Lilia said. “He seems to have inherited your musical abilities.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He may have inherited something from me, but it definitely wasn’t singing ability,” Rio told her. “I’m strictly an instrumentalist.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, perhaps he inherited your ear but picked up Agatha’s singing ability,” the older woman concluded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh please, I don’t sing,” Agatha scoffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course you do, dear,” Lilia corrected. She gave Rio a conspiratorial look. “Don’t let her fool you, she has a lovely voice. But she only sings on karaoke night after several drinks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lilia!” Agatha exclaimed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that right?” Rio laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It has been… known to happen,” Agatha admitted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well maybe one day I’ll be lucky enough to hear it,” Rio grinned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth to reply, but before she could the students began filing onto the stage. The younger grades had performed earlier, and now it was time for the third and fourth graders. Rio watched as the children took their places on the risers, searching each face as they walked from around the back of the bandshell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There he is,” Agatha said, lightly elbowing her. Sure enough, Nicky was climbing the steps. He took his place on the second row, eyes peering out at the crowd. Agatha raised her hand slightly, and Rio waved as well. The moment his gaze fell on them his lips spread in a wide smile, though he kept his arms pressed tightly at his sides. He was dressed in a crisp white button up and black dress pants, just like the rest of the children, his long hair swept back in a neat ponytail.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He looks so serious,” Rio chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He looks like you,” Alice noted. “You showed me his picture but holy shit, I can tell exactly which kid is yours and I’ve never even met him before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I always thought he looked freakishly like Agatha for a kid who isn’t actually hers biologically, but damn did you just copy and paste him?” Jen added, looking at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes were on Agatha, whose expression had tightened with every comment. “What can I say, I have strong genes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“His hair’s closer in color to Agatha’s, though,” Lilia noted. “And I’ve always agreed with Jen, even though you two aren’t biologically related, Nicky looks like you, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s almost like the two of you had a kid together,” Alice teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well that’s… horrifying,” Agatha said finally, her expression cracking into a smile. “Can you imagine what a terror any kid we made would be?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I don’t know, Nicky’s turning out pretty amazing,” Rio replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh. My. God.” Jen muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmhmm, agreed,” Alice nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oblivious, the both of them,” Lilia noted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio and Agatha said, almost simultaneously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing,” Jen replied, quickly breaking eye contact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope, nothing,” Alice agreed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia just turned back toward the stage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at Agatha but before either of them could comment further, the director had cued the accompanist to begin the first piece.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was an instrumentalist, it was true, but there was something about children’s voices that always sent chills down her spine. The choir was absolutely angelic, she would’ve felt that even if Nicky hadn’t been amongst them. But knowing that her boy was up there, singing his heart out along with the rest of them? It made Rio’s heart swell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Four songs later, the director stepped up to the microphone, as she had between all the others.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Our final song is </span>
<em>
<span>Homeward Bound, </span>
</em>
<span>and it will feature a soloist,” the director said, looking toward the students.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Beside her, Agatha gasped, and Rio looked at her before following her gaze back to the stage. Nicky had stepped forward to stand in front of a microphone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Many students auditioned for this opportunity, and they all performed admirably,” the director was saying. “Our soloist today is Nicholas Harkness, a fourth grader in Mrs. Hart’s class.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you know he had a solo?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I had no idea,” Agatha replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Beside them, Lilia chuckled. “I knew.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her friend accusatorially. “</span>
<em>
<span>You </span>
</em>
<span>knew?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I knew he was auditioning, not that he got the solo,” Lilia corrected. “He told me the last time you two came to Sunday dinner. He was bursting at the seams to tell someone. He’s been practicing with his music teacher for weeks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could say anything more, the piano began playing quiet chords. Nicky looked at them in the audience and smiled before turning his eyes back to the director.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As he took his first breath, Agatha grasped Rio’s hand between them.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“In the quiet misty morning when the moon has gone to bed, when the sparrows stop their singing and the sky is clear and red…”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>It was Rio’s turn to gasp. She had known Nicky could sing, on an abstract level, had seen the award in his room, knew he was part of this choir. But upon actually hearing him sing, she was positive he had the sweetest, purest voice she had ever heard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps she was biased. But only a bit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the song was over, Nicky stepped forward and took a bow, and only then did she take her hand out of Agatha’s so they could clap. It took all of Rio’s self-control not to make a complete fool of herself by cheering and whistling like she was at a sporting event. The singers all filed down off the stage and made their way to their parents, and Nicky made a beeline for their group.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you hear me?” he asked as Agatha swept him up in a tight hug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, yes, we heard you!” Agatha exclaimed. “Why didn’t you tell me you had a solo?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just found out yesterday,” Nicky replied with a blush.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t even tell me you auditioned,” Agatha accused, but there was no venom in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wanted to surprise you,” Nicky said. “And I didn’t want you to be sad if I didn’t get it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I am super proud of you for working so hard,” Agatha told him. “And you sounded amazing. Absolutely phenomenal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Really?” he said, finally pulling out of Agatha’s embrace and looking around.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You sounded great up there, kiddo,” Lilia told him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gorgeous voice, as always,” Jen agreed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s eyes finally landed on Rio and his entire face lit up. “Rio! You came!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He hugged her with so much force that she nearly fell over. Rio chuckled, wrapping her arms around him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wouldn’t miss it</span>
<em>
<span>,</span>
</em>
<span>” she told him. “I even brought my friend, Alice, to meet you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky peered around Rio to where Alice was standing beside Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ate and left no crumbs, or whatever the kids are saying nowadays,” Alice told him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky laughed and looked back up at Rio. “I like her, she’s funny.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t tell her that, it’ll go to her head,” Rio groaned, and Nicky laughed more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> like my singing?” he asked, voice serious again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was the best thing I’ve ever heard, </span>
<em>
<span>mi— sweetheart</span>
</em>
<span>,” she replied, releasing him and ruffling his hair. She had been trying to refrain from calling him </span>
<em>
<span>mijo </span>
</em>
<span>ever since the incident at the soccer game, in case the endearment made Agatha uncomfortable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good enough to earn a candy apple?” Nicky asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled. “That’s a question for your Mama, she’s the one who pays for your dental insurance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I please have a candy apple, Mama?” Nicky asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm, I think that can be arranged,” Agatha replied with a grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah!” Nicky exclaimed, pumping his fist in the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky quickly led them to a nearby concession stand where Agatha bought him a candy apple and herself an apple cider.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want anything?” she asked, looking over her shoulder at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I, uh, wouldn’t say no to a cider,” Rio replied from where she was standing beside Lilia. “But you know I can pay for my own order.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha just ignored her. Beside her, Lilia chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Get used to it,” the older woman told her, sipping her own drink. “Agatha takes care of the people who are important to her, it’s just in her nature.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not… I mean…” Rio sputtered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are,” Lilia said with certainty. “She might not say it, but she shows it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One apple cider,” Agatha interrupted, handing Rio her drink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know, Nicky, now that Rio’s been to one of your performances, you and your mother should go to one of hers,” Lilia suggested.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh that would be so cool!” Nicky exclaimed, looking between Rio and Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio’s final recital is coming up in a couple weeks,” Alice chimed in, breaking away from whatever conversation she and Jen had been having for the last ten minutes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s a recital?” Nicky asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a very important performance where I have to play for over an hour and a half and my professors decide if I get my degree or not based on how well I do,” Rio said, her heart pounding at the thought. “I’m not sure you’d enjoy it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s an hour and a half of you showcasing a lot of your own arrangements and compositions,” Alice interrupted. “She downplays it all the time, but this woman is a fu—dging genius. She has this crazy way of taking music from one genre and reworking it to fit another. She arranged most of our pieces that we played at </span>
<em>
<span>Tarot</span>
</em>
<span>’s Fall Gala, and those aren’t even her best. The pieces she’s saving for her recital blow everything else out of the water.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think it sounds cool,” Nicky said with certainty. “Can we go, Mama?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only if Rio wants us there,” Agatha told him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I—” Rio’s voice stuck in her throat. It had been twelve years since she had family attend any of her performances. Did she want Agatha and Nicky there?</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Yes, more than anything.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“If it’s too much, then we won’t—” Agatha began.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!” Rio exclaimed. “No, I… I want you there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as she said it, she realized how much of an overreaction her exclamation was. She bit her lip and crossed her arms tightly over her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her for a moment, as if trying to figure out her reaction, but then she shook her head. “Then we’ll be there. Right, Nicky?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmhmm,” he nodded, mouth full of candy apple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her chest fill with warmth at their agreement, although she was still nervous at the thought of them watching her perform. Her final recital was already nerve wracking enough, but now she would have someone— </span>
<em>
<span>two someones</span>
</em>
<span>— in the audience whose opinions meant the world to her. Her son and her… </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha… </span>
</em>
<span>would get to see and hear her do what she was most passionate about.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly she was far more excited about this recital than she had been before.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>On the fourth anniversary of her parents’ deaths, Rio was arrested on a drunk and disorderly charge outside a bar in Salem, Massachusetts. She was dressed in a slutty witch costume, which ended up ripped and partially covered in blood, liquor, and vomit by the end of the night. She had been well on her way to getting a DUI charge or, worse, getting into an accident, when her date for the night, a woman whose name she couldn’t remember but to whom she would be forever grateful, had taken her keys from her and refused to give them back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This had infuriated a drunken Rio, who had punched the poor woman before falling into a table and breaking several plates and glasses. The bouncer had kicked her out, only for her to become belligerent on the sidewalk. She was arrested, and passed out in the cell before she even got her phone call. An officer had dialed her emergency contact on her cell phone, and Alice had picked her up the next morning. A benevolent judge had ordered her into an outpatient treatment facility, and she hadn’t had a single drop of alcohol since that night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But every year, on the anniversary of their death, Rio was sorely tempted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Every year she vowed that it would be different. And yet, every year, as the date approached on the calendar, the emotions became too much. Like clockwork, the day before the anniversary, she called out sick from her classes and any other responsibilities she might have for the next few days. She then stocked up on the vices she allowed herself— soda, chocolate, salty snacks, and the most mind-numbing television she could find— and locked herself in her room, only emerging for bathroom breaks and to retrieve takeout deliveries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t the healthiest coping strategy, but Rio knew from experience that it was an improvement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was already halfway through a pack of Oreos when she heard a knock at the apartment door. Rio checked the clock— a little after eleven a.m.— and shook her head in confusion. Alice was in class and would’ve used her key. She hadn’t placed an order for any food deliveries yet. Any packages would be left for her downstairs in the building’s lobby. So she couldn’t figure out who on earth would be knocking at her door at this time of the morning. She thought maybe they would go away, but then they knocked again, this time firmer, knuckles sharp against the apartment door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio? It’s Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes widened and she immediately stood from her bed, only to freeze once she was on her feet. She looked down at herself, at the stained t-shirt and threadbare sweatpants she was wearing, and cringed. And she could only imagine what her hair looked like.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was another knock.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You haven’t answered any of my messages or calls. Or Nicky’s.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio did feel guilty about that. After his concert, Nicky had asked if he could save Rio’s number and message her, and both she and Agatha had agreed. He had saved her contact as </span>
<em>
<span>Birthgiver</span>
</em>
<span>, a suggestion from Jen since he already had Agatha saved as </span>
<em>
<span>Mama</span>
</em>
<span>. Rio supposed it was better than Alice’s suggestion of </span>
<em>
<span>Spawn Point</span>
</em>
<span>. He had sent her a smattering of messages since then— a few good mornings and good nights, random things he learned during the day, a few pictures and selfies— and Rio had responded almost immediately to all of them, even if it was just with an emoji or </span>
<em>
<span>lol. </span>
</em>
<span>And of course, Agatha was constantly messaging her to ask about Rio’s appointments with the transplant team, and just checking in in general. But for the last few days, Rio had barely picked up her phone, only using it to order food, and she ignored the growing number of notifications.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, I know you’re in there. Alice said you haven’t left your room in four days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Traitor,” Rio muttered, kicking the dirty laundry strewn about her floor into the corner. </span>
<em>
<span>Four days? </span>
</em>
<span>Had it really been four days already? Rio had lost count.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio emerged from her bedroom and entered the shared living area of the apartment, Agatha’s knocking became even louder and more insistent. Any thought of ignoring her and hoping she would go away was out the window, because the woman was going to earn them a noise complaint if she kept it up. Rio shuffled to the door and cracked it open, peering at Agatha through a narrow sliver.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here’s your proof of life, you can go now,” she grumbled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw dropped as she took in what little of her appearance she could see. “You look like shit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gnashed her teeth in frustration. “Okay, you’ve checked on me </span>
<em>
<span>and </span>
</em>
<span>insulted me. Anything else you wanted?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The older woman’s expression hardened and she crossed her arms. “Are you going to let me in?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time it was Rio’s jaw that dropped. “Wasn’t planning on it. Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because you clearly need an intervention,” Agatha said simply. “So let me in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But— I—” Rio sputtered. Agatha took advantage of her befuddlement to invite herself inside, pushing the door open and gliding past Rio like she owned the place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is… quaint,” Agatha said, looking around the living space.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closed the door and looked around, trying to imagine how Agatha perceived the apartment. The apartment consisted of a small kitchen, a dining area— if you could call a table for two shoved into a corner a dining area— and a living area that barely fit a sofa and Alice’s keyboard. A narrow hallway led to a shared bathroom that was just big enough to turn around in, and the two bedrooms. Alice had the larger of the two, though there really wasn’t much of a difference, as both rooms could barely fit more than a double bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you come over for any particular reason or…?” Rio trailed off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice mentioned you don’t have a dress for your recital,” Agatha replied. “I plan on remedying that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wh—” Rio began, but then another thought occurred to her. “You keep saying you’ve spoken to Alice. Since when do you have her number?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I don’t,” Agatha said, perching on the edge of the small sofa. “But Jen does. And apparently Alice kept talking about you so much that even Jen was getting worried. Real buzz kill since she’s trying to get to know your friend on a more personal level, if you catch my drift.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted. “Sorry if my depression is cockblocking your friend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, well, between Jen mentioning it and already being concerned myself, I thought the situation required a visit,” Agatha continued. She looked her over again. “When was the last time you showered?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“None of your business,” Rio replied defensively.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Considering I can smell you from here, I think it is my business,” Agatha said, wrinkling her nose. “Go shower and get dressed. Quickly, though, we don’t have all day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio briefly considered refusing, but then Lilia’s words from the park echoed in her mind. </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha takes care of the people who are important to her. </span>
</em>
<span>Maybe she could let herself be taken care of, just this once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Also, she did really need a shower. Agatha wasn’t lying when she said Rio smelled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio showered quickly, aware of the woman waiting for her. She emerged from the bathroom and hurried to her room with a towel wrapped around her torso, expecting the room to be empty, only to scream when she found that it wasn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing?” she exclaimed, pulling at the bottom of the towel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have Oreo crumbs in your bed,” Agatha said, ignoring her outburst. “How do you live like this?”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t normally eat in the bed, just when I’m, you know—” Rio picked up the half-eaten container of Oreos, as well as a bag of tortilla chips and a half-eaten bowl of salsa from her nightstand. “—depressed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wrinkled her nose in disgust and turned back to what she had been doing before: going through Rio’s closet. She had already pulled out a pair of black slacks that Rio usually saved for her most important professional gigs, and now she was flicking through Rio’s shirts with a frown of distaste.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought we were going shopping?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, we’re going to my office, so I need you to look the part,” Agatha told her, pulling an olive-green blouse from the closet. “Do you own anything that isn't a polyester blend?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh please, when I Googled you, I saw a picture of you wearing a jumpsuit with a cat’s face printed on it,” Rio scoffed. “Nothing in my closet is that bad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked appalled. “It’s called </span>
<em>
<span>fashion!</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s called </span>
<em>
<span>nobody would be caught dead wearing that in public,”</span>
</em>
<span> Rio replied, rolling her eyes. “Now, please get out of my room so I can put on some underwear. Or did you want to pick that out yourself, too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t miss a beat. Instead her blue eyes looked Rio up and down, lingering on her exposed legs beneath the towel. Her tongue flicked over her bottom lip, so fast that Rio almost missed it, before she met Rio’s gaze and smirked. “Don’t tempt me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With that she plucked the snacks out of Rio’s hands and carried them from the room, leaving Rio standing befuddled in front of her closet.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>The offices of </span>
<em>
<span>Tarot Magazine </span>
</em>
<span>were in Midtown, on the twenty-fifth floor of a gleaming glass skyscraper with a perfect view of the city’s skyline from every window. It was quintessential New York City, the kind of place people envisioned when they dreamed of working in the city. Rio followed Agatha from the elevator through a bustling bullpen full of sharply dressed men and women who barely spared her a glance as they went about their work, until she came to a stop in front of an empty desk where a lanky young man was working.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“William!” Agatha barked, pulling the man’s attention from the computer screen in front of him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The man— who looked to be little more than a teenager— nearly jumped out of his skin. “Miss Harkness! You’re back from lunch early.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Change of plans,” Agatha declared. “Have one of the interns fetch two Caprese chicken salads from </span>
<em>
<span>Tossed</span>
</em>
<span> and bring them to The Closet, please. And have them pick up something for you, as well, my treat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, Miss Harkness, thank you,” William said, picking up his cellphone and immediately sending off the order to an intern.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“The Closet?” </span>
</em>
<span>Rio asked, confused, as Agatha turned on a heel and started walking in the opposite direction again. This time, William joined them, falling into step beside Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Closet is where we store all of the latest looks from different designers that we can pull from for photo shoots,” William told her. “Kind of ironic that a queer-focused fashion magazine has a room called The Closet. I’m William Kaplan, by the way, Miss Harkness’s personal assistant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He offered her his hand to shake, and Rio did so awkwardly as they both followed Agatha at a clipped pace back through the office. “Rio Vidal, I’m Agatha’s, um…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Baby Mama!” William exclaimed excitedly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At that Agatha stopped so abruptly that they both nearly ran into her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve told you not to call her that,” Agatha growled as she turned, scowling at her assistant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The boy’s Adam’s apple bobbed nervously and he looked chagrined. “Apologies, Miss Harkness, Miss Vidal, I just, um, forgot myself, for a second.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They came to a set of glass doors and William hurried in front of them to hold them open. As they stepped inside, Rio stepped closer to Agatha’s side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean, that’s kind of what I am, in a weird way,” she said with a shrug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The corners of Agatha’s lips tugged up in a smirk, but she didn’t respond. Instead she led Rio over to a large gold velvet sofa and gestured for her to sit beside her. In front of them were rows upon rows of clothing racks and, beyond that, shelves lined with shoes and other accessories.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, what are we looking for?” William asked, clapping his hands together dramatically, clearly trying to make them forget his slip of the tongue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio has a recital next week, and she needs to look like a star,” Agatha told him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” he nodded, turning to Rio. “Is there a dress code you have to stick to for something like this? Any stipulations I need to adhere to?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Formal, professional, and fairly modest,” she replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you wanting a gown, or are you thinking a suit?” William asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I’ve worn the same black suit for every performance I’ve had for the last four years,” Rio replied. “I’m not opposed to a suit—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But a gown would be a nice change,” Agatha supplied. “Unless you’re more comfortable in a suit?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine either way,” Rio said honestly. “And this </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> a special occasion, kind of.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Kind of,” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha repeated with a scoff. “It’s your doctoral recital, you deserve to wear something nice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, so not opposed to a suit, but leaning more toward a gown, got it,” William nodded. “You’re what, a size four?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“More or less,” Rio agreed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what most of our sample sizes are, so that works out,” William said, disappearing into the racks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced at Agatha, who was sprawled comfortably on the sofa beside her, looking down at her phone. “Is this why you went into fashion? Because you like shopping and trying on clothes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted. “Oh, god, no. I’ve always hated shopping for myself. Plus, growing up, I was a chubby kid, so shopping was an absolute nightmare.” Agatha tucked her phone away before turning her full attention to Rio. “I learned early on that clothes are a tool that we use to shape how others view us. Clothing can convey confidence, professionalism, sex appeal… the possibilities are as endless as your imagination. We use clothing to present ourselves in a certain light, and being aware of that presentation gives one the ability to manipulate others’ first impressions. In that way, fashion can be very powerful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at the older woman in awe. “I’ve never thought of it like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Obviously,” Agatha said, rolling her eyes, but the slight grin on her face made it clear that her teasing was light.</span>
</p><p>
<span>William chose that moment to emerge from the racks, his arms laden with garments.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This should give us a good start,” he said. “Miss Vidal, there’s a dressing room right this way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The dressing room wasn’t a room exactly, but a curtained-off area to one side of the space. William hung his selections on a smaller rack inside, then closed the curtain behind Rio. She flicked through the dresses, not sure of where to start, when Agatha’s voice rang from outside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come now, Rio darling, give us a show.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could feel the flush in her cheeks and she reached for the hem of her sweater. Might as well start with the first dress on the rack. If Agatha wanted a show, Rio would give her a show.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first gown was white satin, with a sweetheart neckline and a mermaid fit. Once it was on, Rio adjusted her breasts and stepped out to find William sitting beside Agatha, and their chatter died down when she emerged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, don’t you look lovely,” Agatha commented.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know, if the whole music thing doesn’t work out, you could definitely make it as a model,” William told her. “You’ve got the build and the looks for it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, I think,” Rio murmured, smoothing the satin down. “It’s not bad, but I don’t think it will work for a cello recital.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not?” William asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you aware of how a cellist holds their instrument?” Rio asked. At his clueless look, she sighed. “Do you have a chair?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He quickly retrieved a chair for her, and she sat perched on the edge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, so I’d be holding the cello between my knees and…” Rio let her voice trail off as she attempted to part her knees, but the dress’s tight fit prevented her from doing so. “See?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooo, that would be a problem,” William replied, quickly ducking into the dressing room and retrieving four other selections that wouldn’t work for the same reason. “I would suggest trying the </span>
<em>
<span>Francesca Valentini </span>
</em>
<span>next, while I look for more selections with less restrictive skirts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The what?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The black sparkly one,” he told her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio returned to the dressing room and did as he said. The next dress was indeed black and sparkly, a wrap dress with a plunging neckline and a looser skirt, but the skirt had a slit all the way up the thigh. Rio emerged from the room, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This one’s a no, too,” she said with a shrug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s wrong with this one?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t answer out loud. Instead she sat in the chair again and assumed the position she would take to play her cello. The skirt parted along the slit, granting Agatha a perfect view of her panties underneath it— just as it would the entire audience at her recital.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Point taken,” Agatha noted as Rio crossed her legs demurely. “Thank goodness William wasn’t here to be flashed, you might’ve given the poor boy heart palpitations.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I doubt he’s ever seen a woman’s underwear in his life,” Rio said with a grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nor does he have any interest in doing so,” Agatha deadpanned. “William! Avoid dresses with slits in the skirts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The young man emerged from the racks just as Agatha spoke, and he looked down at the selection in his arms with consternation. “Right… um… Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He entered the dressing room only to emerge with more dresses in his arms than he had gone in with.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the next hour, Rio tried on gown after gown. They had figured out the silhouette, but even so none of the selections were exactly right. Some were too restricting in the arms and shoulders, some were too low-cut and would risk a wardrobe malfunction. A few Rio thought would work, but Agatha nixed them for various reasons:</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look like an egg yolk, darling, that won’t do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, too plain, you need something with pizzazz.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck is this, William? She looks like she just arrived on the Mayflower.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. Absolutely not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That last comment had been in regards to a red lace gown that appeared completely sheer beneath the lace, leaving little to the imagination. Rio couldn’t help but grin at how vehemently Agatha had protested that one before sending her back to the dressing room. It had been very sexy, and far too revealing for her recital, Rio agreed with that, but the way Agatha’s pupils had dilated as she looked at her…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had enjoyed that far more than she should have.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped out in a black halter-neck gown with extensive beading and looked down at herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like this one, but I don’t think the beading will work with the instruments,” she said, running her fingers along the shimmering beads. “It’ll scratch the wood, and it might make them rattle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, we can’t have that,” Agatha agreed, peering at her closely. “But you said you like this one. What is it you like about it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like the neckline,” Rio replied. “And I like where the waist hits, I think it’s flattering.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha drummed her fingers against her chin. “William, do we still have the </span>
<em>
<span>Georgiana </span>
</em>
<span>with the lace overlay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think so, but it may be a size two,” he replied, disappearing into the racks for what felt like the hundredth time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gigi’s dresses tend to run a bit large, I think we can make it work,” Agatha told him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>William returned with a single gown, and Rio immediately hoped that it would fit her. She changed quickly, leaving the black beaded dress in a heap on the floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The gown was made of emerald green chiffon with a black lace overlay. It had a halter neckline with a high lace collar, and a black waistband that cinched the waist above a full, flowing skirt. It was fairly modest, but a sheer lace panel in the bodice that ran between her breasts from the neck to the waistband gave it just enough allure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, is everything okay?” Agatha called.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t respond. The back of the dress fastened with a zipper and three tiny buttons, and she was struggling with both. She reached back over her shoulder awkwardly, trying to keep the dress in place while also grasping for the zipper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly another set of hands moved hers out of the way. Rio held the front of the gown in place as Agatha pulled the zipper up, her fingertips warm on Rio’s skin, before moving to fasten the tiny buttons at the top.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There,” Agatha said softly, her breath warm on the back of Rio’s neck. A shiver went down Rio’s spine, and she thought she felt the ghost of lips on her skin, but maybe she was imagining it. Maybe—</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned quickly, facing the other woman. Agatha was barely a breath away from her, so close that Rio could feel the warmth of her body in the air between them. Agatha’s blue eyes practically glowed in the dim light of the dressing room, but even as Rio looked at her the pale blue was almost swallowed up by dark pupils. It would be easy, </span>
<em>
<span>so easy, </span>
</em>
<span>for Rio to lean forward, to give in and press her lips against Agatha’s, and for a moment Rio almost forgot why that would be a bad idea. It wasn’t fair, to be so close and yet unable to do anything, wasn’t fair that Agatha was just so—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Beautiful,” Agatha murmured softly, reaching up to tuck a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. Rio’s breath caught again, as Agatha trailed that same hand down her arm and clasped her hand. Before she could think, Agatha was pulling her out of the dressing room, out into the light and in front of the floor-to-ceiling mirror.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved until she was standing just a few feet behind Rio and released her hand. For a moment Rio could only stare at the other woman’s eyes in the mirror, but then she broke her gaze and looked at herself. She turned, looking at herself at all angles, a smile slowly spreading across her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s giving Evelyn Hugo vibes, and I am here for it,” William commented.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The </span>
<em>
<span>Lomani </span>
</em>
<span>flats, I believe,” Agatha suggested, her voice still soft and rough and clearly not entirely unaffected by the moment they had shared. “The ones with the sparkle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Flats?” William clarified as he made his way to the wall of shoes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Flats,” Agatha confirmed, catching Rio’s gaze in the mirror again. “We don’t need you faceplanting in the middle of your performance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agreed,” Rio said with a nod.</span>
</p><p>
<span>William brought her a pair of flat emerald green pumps, the same shade as the dress, with a crystal buckle on the toes, which she slipped on easily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What time is your recital?” Agatha asked, coughing to clear her throat. She sat on the velvet sofa once more, crossing her legs primly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um, it starts at six thirty, but I have to be at the concert hall by six,” Rio told her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “We’ll arrange for Maribeth and Jordan to meet at your apartment at four to do your hair and makeup. Updos work best for when you’re playing, don’t they?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, but you really don’t have to do that,” Rio told her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, I am aware that I don’t </span>
<em>
<span>have </span>
</em>
<span>to do anything,” Agatha assured her. “But this is a special event in your life, and I have the means to make it spectacular. So, let me spoil you, and let yourself be spoiled for once."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Once Rio had changed back into her own clothes, Agatha retrieved their salads and led her to a terrace. Rio sat in a shiny chrome chair across from Agatha, staring out at the NYC skyline as they both ate in companionable silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Rio said finally.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha waved her fork in the air. “It’s really no—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not just for the dress and… everything,” Rio cut her off. “Thank you for getting me out of my apartment, and out of my… funk. I needed that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s expression softened as she speared another bite of chicken and greens on her fork. “Anytime.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled softly as she ate her own salad. After a few bites, Agatha looked at her again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why music?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed down her bite of chicken, almost choking because she hadn’t quite finished chewing. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You asked me why I chose to go into fashion earlier, and I told you,” Agatha explained. “Now I’m curious. Why music?’</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a moment to sip her water and think. When she put her bottle down, she shrugged. “Music was always… easy, I guess. I was good at it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised her brow at that. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone say getting a music degree was easy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, no, getting a music degree was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done in my life,” Rio rebuffed. “There’s a reason I dropped out the first time, and it wasn’t just my parents’ deaths.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t understand,” Agatha said, her expression now one of confusion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back in her chair, salad forgotten on her lap. “School was always hard for me. I did well enough on paper, but all of my report cards had notes about me talking too much or getting distracted easily. Plus I didn’t really fit in with the other kids. I was always the weird kid, the one who read too much and said weird things and played too rough at recess.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Music was… the thing that made my brain slow down. My dad started teaching me to play guitar when I was five, and I picked it up quickly. Most popular music is made up of the same chords in almost the same patterns, so once I figured out how to recognize those patterns I could learn new songs in minutes. My mom decided to challenge me and signed me up for violin lessons and, well, I was good at that, too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When I was a teenager, I wanted to be in a rock band, but Mom was adamant that I needed a degree. But I struggled so much in college— so much. I had nobody keeping me accountable, and I was floundering. If I hadn’t been matched with Alice as a roommate, and if we hadn’t shared most of the same classes, I never would’ve lasted three years the first time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yet here you are getting your doctorate,” Agatha said, her gaze pensive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “I went back to school as a way to get my life back. And because I knew my parents would’ve hated the fact that I didn’t finish. And then I really started studying music from other time periods and cultures, really making the connections. I fell in love with jazz and improv, and I started arranging and composing my own works. And now, yeah… Here I am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here you are,” Agatha repeated, her gaze pensive. After a moment, she shook her head. “I’m sorry, it’s just… I can’t help thinking how similar you and Nicky are. It’s remarkable, really. Genetics really are something else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Poor kid,” Rio said, but she smiled as she said it. She poked at her salad absentmindedly. “I did it for him, too.” When Agatha looked at her with confusion, she continued. “Got sober, went back to school. If he did reach out and want to reconnect someday, I wanted to be someone he could be proud of.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think the only thing that could make him any more in love with you is if you trained seals at the aquarium,” Agatha told her in a serious tone, but her eyes glittered with mirth and a grin was tugging at the corners of her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re probably right,” Rio chuckled, eating the final bites of her salad before closing it and tossing it into Agatha’s wastebasket. “I’m glad you two are coming to my recital. I haven’t had family at one of my performances since… well… since my parents died.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was a car accident?” Agatha asked, though Rio knew that she already knew the answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio nodded. “They were on their way home from watching one of my performances, actually. It had been raining, and they hit water and hydroplaned.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Agatha said, voice soft.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We would always go out to eat after my performances,” Rio continued, unable to stop the flow of words. “Dad would splurge and take us to a local steakhouse, nothing fancy by New York standards, but a big deal for us. But there was a party that night, so instead of going out with them, I went to the party with my friends. I was still drunk when my RA and the college chaplain came to my room the next morning to tell me what had happened.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry you went through that,” Agatha told her. “I’m sorry you had to endure that pain.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her choice of words made Rio pause. Nobody had ever put it that way before. </span>
<em>
<span>I’m sorry you </span>
</em>
<span>had to </span>
<em>
<span>endure that pain. </span>
</em>
<span>Even in years of therapy nobody had said it that way. But it painted the accident in a different light. It happened. Her parents died. And she had to deal with the grief. She hadn’t dealt with it well, but she had dealt with it. She had endured it. She had continued to live.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sometimes I would find myself wishing that I had been in the car with them,” Rio said, her voice small. “Then I wouldn’t have had to endure it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But then you wouldn’t be here. And I am very glad you’re here” Agatha said, her voice equally as soft. Then her eyes widened. “For Nicky’s sake, I mean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, yeah,” Rio replied. “Obviously.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you had died then he wouldn’t be here. But even if somehow he was, if he had a different biological mother, if…” Agatha stopped talking and pursed her lips, clearly needing a moment for her thoughts to catch up. “What I mean is, as difficult as it has been to invite his birth mother, to invite </span>
<em>
<span>you, </span>
</em>
<span>into our lives… I’m glad it’s you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt like something warm had taken root in her chest. “Thanks, Agatha.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Rio shifted her weight nervously from one foot to the other, very thankful that Agatha had chosen flats for her to wear. Her hair was up in a sleek bun, her makeup was immaculately painted on, and the dress seemed to fit even better than it had when she tried it last week, though how Agatha could’ve had it tailored was beyond her. Her instruments were tuned and lined up at the edge of the stage, and the musicians she had enlisted to help her with some of the pieces were all sitting on the front row of the small auditorium chatting amongst themselves, because they didn’t have over a decade of higher education riding on this performance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Behind them, lined up all in a row, were the four music professors who would be grading her performance. She knew all of them well, having worked closely with them for the past five years, and they had all advised her in various ways on her pieces and performance, but she was still nervous for them to see the final product.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the auditorium was mostly empty. A smattering of students were scattered throughout, most of them undergrads there to fulfil their course requirements of watching other musicians perform. Rio knew most of their faces from teaching them as freshmen, and a large group from her current music theory class was seated together on the left side of the auditorium.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Miss Vidal, are you ready?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nearly jumped out of her skin as the stage manager, another graduate student named Darcy, got her attention. She knew it was time for the show to begin, but she was still waiting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Nicky weren’t there yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you give me five more minutes?” she asked. “I’m just waiting for someone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Darcy nodded. “Yes, but only five, because the space is only reserved for three hours, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Darcy stepped away, Alice took her place. “You okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A bit nervous, but okay,” Rio replied, her gaze looking back at the auditorium doors.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’ll be here,” Alice assured her, reading her mind. “Agatha Harkness doesn’t strike me as the type to commit and then not show up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What if Nicky got sick?” Rio asked. “What if something happened? What if there was an accident—?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, you’re spiraling,” Alice said, grabbing her by the shoulders. “Has Agatha messaged you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio checked her phone for the hundredth time. “No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No news is good news,” Alice assured her. “She has Nicky. He’s </span>
<em>
<span>your </span>
</em>
<span>kid, biologically anyway. If he’s anything like you, and we already know he is, I bet he’s an absolute </span>
<em>
<span>menace </span>
</em>
<span>to get out the door on time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a deep breath and let it out. “You’re probably right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know I’m right,” Alice said. “So take some more of those deep breaths and focus on the music. They’ll be here. I know it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The five minutes passed and Agatha and Nicky were still absent. When Cody approached her for the second time, Rio nodded before he could even speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m ready,” she said, smoothing down the front of her dress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You got this,” Alice stage whispered as Rio stepped out onto the stage to a smattering of applause.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio retrieved her cello from its stand and made her way to the chair in the center of the stage. As she sat down and adjusted her dress, the doors at the back of the auditorium opened and two familiar figures slipped inside. The bright lights made it difficult to see, but even so Rio knew exactly who it was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi Rio!” Nicky’s loud whisper carried in the silent auditorium, followed by Agatha’s emphatic </span>
<em>
<span>shhhhhh! </span>
</em>
<span>Several of the gathered students and professors chuckled at the exclamation, and Rio couldn’t help the wide smile that spread across her face. She gave a little wave before setting her bow against the strings, her anxiety gone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next ninety minutes were somehow the fastest and slowest of Rio’s life. The first half of her recital was focused on the cello, and she played several pieces that showcased her virtuosity with the instrument. The last half was focused more on her work as a composer and arranger. She and Alice played an original sonata she had composed for violin and piano. Then came a collection of pieces she had composed or arranged for string quartet, followed by pieces for a jazz ensemble. Finally she picked up a guitar and a soprano joined her and Alice to perform a haunting vocalise she had composed in memory of her parents.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When it was over, Rio would only remember it as a blur. The audience clapped, she bowed and thanked her friends for their talents, and it was all done. She made her way to the audience where her professors and students congratulated her on a successful performance, but she found that she didn’t really care about their praise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky collided with her in one of his full-body hugs, and Rio felt tears bubbling up in her eyes as she hugged him back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You came,” she said, looking from him to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry we were late, but someone was very insistent that he wear his best suit,” Agatha told her. “I picked the tie, though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sure enough, Nicky was impeccably dressed in a dark gray suit with an emerald green necktie. Rio smiled as she reached out and touched the green silk, perfectly matched to her dress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look very handsome, little man,” she told him, and he beamed at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We got you flowers, too, didn’t we, Mama?” Nicky said, looking back at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled a bouquet from behind her back and handed it to Rio, who looked down at the mixture of sunflowers and red roses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mama wanted to get roses, but I said sunflowers were better, so we com— compromised,” Nicky explained. “Do you like them?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love them!” Rio told him, pulling him in for another hug. She looked at Agatha over his head. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re welcome,” she replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did you think of the performance?” Rio asked, curious as to what a nine-year-old’s opinion would be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was so cool,” Nicky replied. “How did you learn all those instruments?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lots and lots of practice,” Rio told him. She looked up at Agatha. “What did you think?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked surprised that she was asking for her opinion, but she schooled her expression quickly. “I think you’ve been underselling yourself. Seriously, that was amazing. You’re brilliant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s cheeks flushed at the compliment. She had to clear her throat before asking her next question. “So, um, do you guys have any plans for after this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled softly. “I actually made dinner reservations for us, if you’re interested.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile widened. “That sounds—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned to see Alice standing with their friend, looking at her expectantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We were gonna go grab dinner and drinks, do you want to come?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked from her friends to Nicky and Agatha, her decision already made.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I already have plans, actually,” she said. “Raincheck?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice looked at her sagely, her expression making it clear that she knew exactly what this meant to Rio, and then she pulled her in for a tight hug, nearly squishing her bouquet in the process.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have fun with your family,” she whispered so that only Rio could hear her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Rio said, squeezing her back. “I fully intend to.”</span>

<p>Rio adjusted her bag as she made her way through the crowded hallway. She had gotten caught up in grading essays for the History of Music class she was assisting with, and now she was running late for her meeting. When she reached the door to her destination, she took a deep breath before knocking.</p><p>“Come in.”</p><p>Inside the room were three of her favorite professors— her dissertation committee. Dr. Richards, her longtime advisor and acting chair of the committee, was an expert in strings and Spanish and Latin American music. Dr. Grey was a skilled pianist and historical musicologist. Finally, Dr. Munroe was a professional jazz musician turned academic.</p><p>“I’m sorry I’m late,” Rio said, taking the final empty seat at the end of the table. “I was grading essays from Dr. Grey’s Music History class, actually.”</p><p>“If it was the nine o’clock section, we’re fortunate that you made it at all,” Dr. Grey replied with a chuckle. “But now that you’re here, let’s get started.”</p><p>The meeting was tedious. For nearly an hour they poured over Rio’s work, going over notes that each professor had made and discussing edits to be made, sections to be expounded upon, and further research that needed to be done. By the time they were finished, Rio had a page and a half of notes to work through, and the beginnings of a headache, but at least her professors seemed pleased with her progress.</p><p>“Well, I think that covers everything we had noted,” Dr. Richards said, tapping his pen against the desk. “You’re doing good work, really <em>great</em> work. If there’s nothing else, I think we should look at scheduling our next meeting. I know the holidays are busy, so I think having a quick meeting at the end of January just to cover the things we addressed today would be beneficial.”</p><p>The other professors nodded, but Rio hesitated. “I may need to postpone that meeting, actually.”</p><p>Dr. Richards’s eyes widened. Rio never missed or rescheduled a meeting. Once, she had even shown up to his office with a low grade fever before he sent her off to get tested for the flu— a test which had come back positive. So Rio understood his surprise.</p><p>“I’m actually having surgery on January twenty-fifth,” Rio told them. “It’s laparoscopic, so recovery won’t take as long, but the doctor is recommending I rest for at least two weeks. I’ve asked the college for a short leave from my teaching assistant duties. I should still be able to work on these revisions, and I may be able to meet via video chat, but I probably won’t be up for an in-person meeting at that time.”</p><p>“Of course,” Dr. Richards said, as Dr. Grey and Dr. Munroe nodded.</p><p>“I hope it’s nothing serious,” Dr. Munroe added, her dark eyes concerned.</p><p>“No, well, um, not for me, necessarily,” Rio replied. “I’m donating a kidney to a… relative. My health is fine, great even, but he’s, well… He’s only nine, and he has a congenital kidney malformation, so I decided to get tested.”</p><p>“That’s very generous of you,” Dr. Munroe said with a small smile.</p><p>“Will this delay your dissertation?” Dr. Grey asked. “I don’t mean to sound insensitive, I just wondered, since we had discussed a tentative defense date in April.”</p><p>“I’m hoping it won’t. Like I said, recovery is only two weeks, and I still intend to work on my dissertation during that time.” Rio grinned wryly. “Honestly, having two weeks with no teaching assistant duties and no gigs might help speed along my writing.”</p><p>“That’s true,” Dr. Richards chuckled. “But we need to be realistic. If there are complications, it could put you behind a semester. There’s nothing wrong with taking more time and planning your defense for the fall.”</p><p>Rio pressed her tongue to the inside of her jaw. “My scholarship funding runs out after the spring semester. I need to finish and defend before May.”</p><p>All three professors nodded in understanding. Dr. Richards reached out and gave her shoulder a reassuring pat.</p><p>“You have all of our support in reaching that goal,” he said. “Let’s plan to touch base via Zoom on January twenty-seventh. That will give you a week to recover from your surgery. Then we’ll plan for one more meeting at the beginning of March for final revisions, and to schedule your defense for the end of April. How does that sound?”</p><p>“That sounds like a plan,” Rio nodded. “Thank you all for your input and your support.”</p><p>With that they wrapped up the meeting. Dr. Munroe congratulated Rio on her recital once again, and Dr. Grey reminded her to not stay up too late grading essays. As the door closed behind her she took a deep breath— she still had a lot of work ahead of her, but the end was in sight.</p><p>As soon as she returned to her office, she was met with a group of freshmen asking for help on their final music theory review, and she spent the next hour reviewing chord progressions and inversions with them. Once they were gone, she sat back in her chair and stared at the ceiling for a long moment, her brain buzzing.</p><p>
<em>She needed to finish grading the Music History essays.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She needed to eat lunch.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She needed to finalize her leave paperwork for her surgery and recovery.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She needed to arrange for someone to cover her private lessons during that time.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She needed to make sure she didn’t have any gigs scheduled for those two weeks.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She needed to practice for the Christmas gigs she had coming up.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She needed to buy everyone Christmas gifts.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She needed to buy Nicky a Christmas gift.</em>
</p><p>
<em>So much… so many things…</em>
</p><p>Her phone rang, pulling her out of her spiral. She looked down at the familiar contact and immediately answered.</p><p>“Hey, Agatha, what’s up?”</p><p>“I need a favor.” The older woman sounded out of breath and her tone was urgent.</p><p>Rio sat up straighter in her chair. “Yeah, I’ll help in any way I can.”</p><p>“Would you be interested in watching Nicky for the weekend?” she asked. “You can stay in my guest room, and I’ll send you Clint’s contact information so he can take you anywhere you need to go while you’re with Nicky. You’ll have to pick him up from school and take him to his dialysis appointment this afternoon, but other than that you can make whatever plans you would like with him, within reason of course, he does need to stay on a schedule. Normally I would ask Wanda, but she and Nat are going out of town and—”</p><p>“Agatha, it’s okay,” Rio interrupted. Agatha sounded flustered in a way Rio had never heard before. “I can stay with him.”</p><p>Agatha let out a heavy, relieved sigh. “Thank you.”</p><p>“His school dismisses at three, right?” Rio asked, checking her watch.</p><p>“Yes, but normally I check him out fifteen minutes early on dialysis days,” Agatha replied. “I’m sorry it’s so last minute, I hope you don’t have to rearrange your schedule.”</p><p>“I have a rehearsal tomorrow night, but Nicky can tag along. Carol and Maria have a daughter about his age, they can keep each other company,” Rio told her, packing her things. “I was just grading some papers, and I can do that while Nicky’s getting dialysis. I just need to swing by my apartment and pack an overnight bag. Clint can pick me up there.”</p><p>“I’ll go ahead and message him to be there in an hour,” Agatha told her. Rio could hear her typing on her phone screen before speaking again. “I really appreciate this.”</p><p>“It’s really fine, Agatha,” Rio assured her. “Is everything okay?”</p><p>Agatha sighed again. “Yes… Well, no. I have to go to Salem, I’m actually on my way to the airport now. My mother has had a health emergency. The facility she’s in is taking care of her, but I need to be present to make decisions about her care.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m so sorry,” Rio remarked. “Is there anything else you need?”</p><p>“No, but thank you,” Agatha replied. “Just take care of our boy.”</p><p>“I can do that,” Rio assured her. “But you let me know if you need anything, okay?”</p><p>“Alright,” Agatha reluctantly agreed. Rio heard a muffled announcement through the phone. “That’s my train boarding. Goodbye, Rio, and thank you again.”</p><p>“You’re welcome, Agatha,” Rio repeated. “Be safe. <em>Te veo</em>.”</p><hr/><p> </p><p>When Clint parked the SUV in front of Nicky’s school, Rio’s overnight bag and her string bass were shoved into the trunk, the neck of her bass sticking over the top of the backseat. She hadn’t been sure how Clint would react to the giant instrument, but he was a complete professional as he helped her pack it into the trunk, making sure it was secure before gingerly closing the trunk.</p><p>Nicky’s school was a neat brick building, across the road from the park where Nicky played soccer. It had been a public school that was shut down due to budget cuts, then turned into a private school with a particular focus on kids with special needs, particularly neurodivergent students. Inside the school had been renovated to allow for larger spaces and as much natural light as possible. Brightly painted murals filled the walls, and any empty space was filled with student projects and artwork. A large space in the lobby was dedicated to a display of projects about holidays around the world, and beside a small Christmas tree sat a Menorah and Kinara.</p><p>Rio made her way into the office, toward the receptionist. “Hello, I’m here to pick up Nicholas Harkness.”</p><p>The young woman looked up at her. “Do you have your photo ID?”</p><p>“Oh, um, yes,” Rio replied, digging into her purse for her driver’s license.</p><p>The woman looked at the card, then back at Rio. “This is expired.”</p><p>“Well, yeah, I don’t have to drive anywhere here in the city,” Rio replied. “But it’s still me, still looks like me, just… expressionless.”</p><p>The receptionist rolled her eyes, but went to click on the computer. “Rosario Vidal… you aren’t on Nicholas’s approved pickup list.”</p><p>Rio’s face fell as anxiety began gnawing at her. “Well, it was kind of last minute, his mom had an emergency.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, but if you’re not on the list, I can’t let him leave with you. It’s a safety issue, you understand.”</p><p>“Okay, um, let me just call his mom,” Rio replied, already dialing Agatha’s number.</p><p>“We can’t add someone to a child’s approved pickup list by phone, the legal guardian has to fill out a form,” the receptionist explained as the phone rang.</p><p>“You don’t understand, he has a dialysis appointment this afternoon that I really have to get him to,” Rio explained. If they didn’t let her take Nicky, he wouldn’t make it to his dialysis appointment on time, and if he missed his appointment, Rio didn’t want to think of how sick he would be. “It’s fine for him to go with me, Agatha will tell you.”</p><p>“Like I said, Miss Vidal, we can’t add someone to Nicholas’s pickup list based on a phone call.”</p><p>“I’m his <em>mother</em>, for fuck’s sake!” Rio exclaimed.</p><p>The receptionist stared at Rio with wide eyes, and Rio realized her cell phone was no longer ringing.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha’s voice rang out from the speaker.</p><p>“Agatha, I’m sorry, but they won’t let me check Nicky out,” Rio explained. “They say I’m not on his <em>approved</em> pickup list.”</p><p>“Damn, I forgot about that,” Agatha sighed. “I’m sorry, Rio, I totally forgot that that was a thing.”</p><p>“The receptionist says you can’t add a person to the list by phone,” Rio explained.</p><p>“Oh for the love—” Agatha began. “Is Miss Frost there?”</p><p>“Miss Frost is in a meeting,” the secretary replied.</p><p>“Miss Lee, can you tell me who is on Nicholas’s approved pickup list?” Agatha asked, her voice saccharine sweet but even on the phone Rio could hear the frustration she was trying to mask.</p><p>“I can only give you that information on the school line that verifies caller ID, Miss Harkness.”</p><p>There was an abrupt beep as Agatha disconnected the call without another word. A moment later, the school phone rang.</p><p>Miss Lee picked up. “Hello? Yes, Miss Harkness.” Rio sighed as the receptionist turned to her computer screen. “Nicholas’s approved pickup list… There’s you, of course, then Wanda Maximoff, Lilia Calderu, Jennifer Kale, and… Clint Barton. Hello? Miss Harkness?”</p><p>Rio’s phone rang and she picked it up.</p><p>“Yes, Agatha?”</p><p>“I’ve messaged Clint and he’s on his way inside,” Agatha told her. “I’m sorry, Rio, I was in a hurry and didn’t think.”</p><p>“It’s fine, really,” Rio assured her. “And, um, what I was saying when you picked up the call—“</p><p>Agatha cut her off. “It’s fine, Rio. You were worried. We can talk about it later.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to speak, but before she could, Clint came through the door. He gave the receptionist his ID and she immediately called Nicky’s teacher for him to be dismissed.</p><p>Rio gave them both a disgruntled frown. “Well, that was easy enough.”</p><p>“Seems like everything is okay now,” Agatha said. “I’ll talk to you later. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any more trouble.”</p><p>“Thanks, Agatha,” Rio replied, disconnecting the call.</p><p>Nicky burst into the office with the energy of a tiny tornado. As soon as his eyes landed on Rio, his entire face lit up.</p><p>“Rio!” he exclaimed, wrapping his arms around her waist.</p><p>“Nicky!” Rio mimicked, laughing, embarrassment and tension fading from her mind and her body.</p><p>A few minutes later, they were in the car, making the short drive to the dialysis center. The closer they got, the more Nicky’s excitement seemed to fade.</p><p>“Do I <em>have</em> to do dialysis today?” he asked, his voice a high whine.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio replied sadly. “But it won’t be for much longer, alright? After we have surgery in January, you won’t have to do any more dialysis.”</p><p>“Mama has a countdown on the calendar,” Nicky told her. “Thirteen more appointments.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Thirteen too many,” Nicky sighed.</p><p>“I agree,” Rio nodded. “But we gotta do what we gotta do to keep you healthy, bud. I know it feels like a long time, but it’ll be over before you know it.”</p><p>Nicky grumbled as he sank down further in his seat, hands busy with the fidget toy on his keychain. “Mama sent me a message that you were going to pick me up and stay with me this weekend, but she didn’t tell me where she was going.”</p><p>That surprised Rio. “Well, um, she had to go take care of your grandmother.”</p><p>“Oh,” Nicky said, his voice still glum. “Mama’s always sad when she has to go visit Grandma. I think Grandma’s mean to her.”</p><p>Rio glanced up in the rearview mirror and for a fraction of a second Clint’s eyes met hers before he focused back on the road. Rio looked back at the boy sulking in the seat beside her.</p><p>“I can’t imagine anyone being mean to your Mama,” Rio said honestly. “She’s a big girl, don’t you worry about her. You just worry about you, okay? We’re going to have a great weekend together, once we get this dialysis appointment over with, I guarantee it. Your Mama will be much happier knowing you’re happy and having a good weekend, ya know? One less thing for her to worry about.”</p><p>Nicky didn’t look particularly satisfied with that answer, his little brows knit with concern as they arrived at the dialysis center. He followed Rio inside with a resolved expression, going through the familiar motions as she checked him in at the reception desk and a nurse took them back to the procedure area.</p><p>As Nicky sank down into one of the plain gray recliners, Rio couldn’t help but notice how small he looked, far too small for this place. He pulled off his sweater and the nurse helped him roll up the sleeve of his uniform, revealing a forearm smattered with faded bruises and scars from previous visits. Rio sat in the stiff chair beside him as the nurse spoke gently to him, asking about his day, his school. It was clear she had worked with him before, and they both had this process down pat.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Nicky’s voice pulled her out of her thoughts, and Rio looked away from where the nurse was holding two capped needles and pressing against his arm.</p><p>“Yeah?” she said, trying to focus on his face.</p><p>“Can you hold my hand when she sticks me?” he asked. “Mama always holds my hand… Just when the needles go in.”</p><p>“Of course,” Rio nodded, reaching for his free hand. She ran her fingers along his knuckles, trying not to watch as the nurse inserted the needles. “You’re the bravest boy I know, you know that?”</p><p>“‘M not brave,” Nicky said, his eyes watering. “I hate it.”</p><p>“I know, I know,” Rio murmured, standing so she could put her arm around his shoulders. “It’ll all be over soon, sweetheart, you’ll see.”</p><p>“There we go, all done,” the nurse said, taping the lines into place. “Would you like me to get you a blanket, Nicky?”</p><p>“Yes, please,” he murmured, releasing Rio’s hand so he could wipe the tears from his eyes. “Can you get my Nintendo out of my bag, Rio?”</p><p>“Yeah, I got it,” she said, pressing one last kiss to his temple before bending to dig through his backpack. She found the turquoise device and handed it over. “What are you playing?”</p><p>“Minecraft,” he told her. “But I’ve got Pokemon and Mario and Zelda and Animal Crossing, too.”</p><p>Rio recognized a few of those things. The nurse returned and tucked a blanket around Nicky before leaving them to their own devices. The dialysis machine whirred beside them as Nicky’s blood traveled up one tube, through the machine, and then back into his body.</p><p>“What are you gonna do?” Nicky asked as Rio sat back down and pulled her tablet from her bag.</p><p>“I have some papers I need to grade,” she told him. “Then I might work on my dissertation, if that’s okay with you.”</p><p>“What’s a dessert station?” Nicky asked, videogame console forgotten in his lap.</p><p>“<em>Dissertation</em>,” Rio repeated, this time slower.</p><p>“Diss-er-tation,” Nicky mimicked, and Rio nodded.</p><p>“It’s a really, really long paper,” Rio explained. “I have to write it to get my PhD.”</p><p>“How long?” he asked.</p><p>“So far it’s almost 200 pages.”</p><p>Nicky’s jaw dropped. “That’s not a paper, that’s a whole book!”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I guess it could be.”</p><p>“What’s it about?”</p><p>“Well, dissertations can be about a lot of different things depending on what a person is studying,” she said. “Mine is about music and how people mix different genres when they’re composing music.”</p><p>“That sounds really hard,” Nicky noted.</p><p>“Well, it hasn’t been easy,” Rio admitted. “But I’m almost finished.”</p><p>Nicky nodded sagely. “You’re really smart, Rio. Are you smarter than Mama?”</p><p>Rio snorted. “I doubt it.”</p><p>“Mama doesn’t have a PhD.”</p><p>“Yeah, but your mama is super smart about other things,” Rio told him. “I’m smart about music and stuff. We’re both smart in our own ways, but I wouldn’t try to compare us to one another.”</p><p>“Do you think when I’m grown up I’ll be as smart as you and Mama?” Nicky whispered, eyes bright.</p><p>“Oh, you’re going to be smarter than both of us, I have no doubt,” Rio replied earnestly.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Rio was feeling pretty confident about this whole parenting thing.</p><p>Their first night in Agatha’s apartment had been great; Nicky was tired when they left dialysis, so they grabbed takeout and spent the rest of the evening curled up on the sofa watching <em>Luca</em> and <em>Encanto</em>. Agatha had texted to check in and see how things were going, and Rio had proudly informed her that everything was great before tucking Nicky into bed and turning in herself.</p><p>She had Saturday all planned out. They would go get breakfast, go to a farmer’s market, then spend the afternoon at the park. She had already shared the itinerary with Clint, so he could plan their routes, and arranged for him to pick them up that morning. Rio was so excited to spend the day with Nicky that she had woken up early, gotten dressed, and had her coffee before deciding it was time to wake the boy up so he could be ready by the time Clint arrived.</p><p>“Nicky?” she said softly, as she slowly opened the door to his room. It was, somehow, even messier than the last time she had been inside. The entire <em>Percy</em> <em>Jackson</em> series of books was scattered across his floor, clearly having fallen from being stacked on his nightstand. A handful of dirty clothes were inside the clothes hamper, but most were on the floor surrounding it. Something sticky had spilled across his nightstand from one of the many cups there, and hadn’t been completely wiped up. The desk was covered with half-finished worksheets and drawings.</p><p>Nicky was still asleep, sprawled out on his stomach in his bed, looking very much like one of the starfish they had seen that day at the aquarium. His eyes were closed tight, and his long hair was a tangled mess around his face. He wore a threadbare Cranberries t-shirt that Rio had no doubt belonged to Agatha long before Nicky was ever born and a pair of plaid boxers, and at some point in the night he had twisted himself up in his covers.</p><p>“Nicky, sweetheart, time to wake up,” Rio said, shaking his shoulder gently.</p><p>He groaned and shook off her hand, burying his face further in his pillow.</p><p>“Clint’s on his way to take us to breakfast,” Rio told him, keeping her voice soft in spite of her excitement.</p><p>“Noooo,” Nicky groaned before turning his head. He peered at Rio with narrow eyes. “I wanna sleep.”</p><p>“I know, but we have things to do,” Rio told him. “Breakfast first, then we’ll go to the farmer’s market and get a few things, and then we can spend some time in the park, maybe take your soccer ball and—“</p><p>“No,” Nicky said, his voice clearer and more insistent this time. “I don’t want to go to a stupid market or to the park.”</p><p>Rio’s heart dropped. She had really thought that Nicky would be excited to do those things with her. “Well, plans can change. But you need to get up and get dressed. Clint will be here soon to take us to breakfast, and you do need to eat.”</p><p>“There’s cereal in the cabinet,” he huffed.</p><p>Rio sighed. “Nicky—“</p><p>“I don’t wanna go!” he exclaimed. “I don’t want any stupid breakfast! I just wanna sleep!”</p><p>He rolled away from her then, and she was left staring at his back and the mess of his hair. Rio bit her lip. She could let him sleep in, it was Saturday after all. But she had already let him sleep later than he would on a weekday, and Agatha had stressed that he needed to stay on a schedule. Plus, she was pretty sure if he got up and got something to eat, his mood would improve drastically.</p><p>“Nicholas Harkness, get out of this bed and go get dressed,” Rio said, trying to keep her voice steady and authoritative.</p><p>Nicky rolled back over and glared at her. “But—“</p><p>“No buts,” Rio told him. “You get out of bed right now so we can go out. If you’re not dressed in thirty minutes, I’ll tell Clint to go home, and instead of spending the day doing fun stuff, you can spend it cleaning this room. Goodness knows it needs it.”</p><p>Nicky stared at the ceiling, then threw his blankets off with a huff. “Fine!”</p><p>He kicked himself free of his covers and disappeared into the bathroom with another huff, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>Rio stared at the door, completely befuddled.</p><p>“What. The. Fuck?”</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Rio was failing at this whole parenting thing.</p><p>This wasn’t even parenting, not really, just watching him for a weekend, and she was failing. She had been lulled into a false sense of security by everything going so well with Nicky up until this point, but now… Maybe she just wasn’t cut out for this. Maybe this just further proved that she had made the right decision when she gave him up.</p><p>They had made it to breakfast, albeit thirty minutes later than Rio had planned. Clint had waited patiently for them, and Rio had apologized profusely even though he didn’t seem bothered or surprised by their tardiness. Nicky had not apologized, but rather had continued to sulk for the entire drive. The only time he had spoken the entire time they were at breakfast was to place his order. The rest of the morning, he had given Rio the cold shoulder any time she tried to strike up any conversation.</p><p>Nicky had asked if they could skip the farmer’s market and just go to the park, but Rio needed to pick up some ingredients for a meal she wanted to cook the next day, and she had hoped to get some Christmas gifts. When she refused to skip the market, he started sulking again. Rio remedied that by taking him directly to a stall that had a couple of dairy goats with them as mascots. Petting the goats seemed to cheer him up, and he enjoyed tasting all of the samples different vendors had to offer, stuffing himself with all the cheese and jam and baked goods he could find as Rio shopped around.</p><p>But then it started raining, big, cold drops that sent shivers down Rio’s spine. They ran to the car, and when Nicky realized that their plans to play in the park were ruined, he lashed out again. Every alternate suggestion Rio made for an indoor activity was shot down until finally Rio asked Clint to take them back to Agatha’s apartment. Once their, Nicky had retreated up to his room without a word, leaving Rio to wonder what on earth she had done to upset him.</p><p>
<em>Hey, I don’t want to bother you but I think Nicky hates me and I don’t know why. Any advice?</em>
</p><p>She sent off the message to Agatha and collapsed onto the sofa with a huff. Up until now, being around Nicky had been so easy. But up until now, with the exception of the first day they met, she had only been around Nicky with Agatha as a buffer. Agatha, who actually knew how to parent. Agatha, whose temperament and boundaries Nicky already knew. Agatha, whose absence probably worried Nicky far more than he would ever admit out loud.</p><p>Rio rolled over and groaned into an accent pillow. She was aware enough to realize all of these things, but that didn’t mean she knew of a solution to any of them.</p><p>Her phone buzzed with a text message, but instead of a response from Agatha a completely different contact popped up. Before Rio could even process the first message, a second one popped up.</p><p>
<em><strong>H</strong>: I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you since we last saw each other.</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>H</strong>: What are you doing tonight?</em>
</p><p>Rio dropped her phone onto the sofa cushion in front of her. Hela was the last person she could talk to about any of this, and their on-and-off-again, no-strings-attached whatever was not something she had the emotional capacity to deal with at the moment.</p><p align="right">
<em>Rehearsal tonight. Filling in for the bassist in Carol and Maria’s band.</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>H</strong>: We should go out sometime when you’re free.</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>H</strong>: Tell Carol and Maria I said hi.</em>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes because she would definitely not be doing that. Carol and Maria held the same opinion of Hela as Alice. It wasn’t entirely unearned, although Rio thought their feelings toward the other woman were extreme.</p><p>Her relationship with Hela was complicated, even though they always endeavored to make it as uncomplicated as possible. Rio met the older woman when she first started her graduate studies at NYU. Hela had been in her final year of her own doctorate, and she and Rio had been assigned to assist with Dr. Grey’s History of Music classes.</p><p>They had started dating soon after meeting, and Rio had fallen deep for the operatic soprano. Hela was brilliant and talented, and Rio practically worshipped the ground she walked on, which suited Hela perfectly. Rio didn’t mind lifting Hela up and praising her accomplishments, that was the kind of person she was. But after a while, Rio began to realize how one-sided their relationship was. She made time for Hela, but Hela hardly ever made time for her, and when she did, she expected Rio’s endless gratitude for doing so. Rio celebrated Hela’s accomplishments, but her own went entirely unnoticed.</p><p>Rio had made excuses: Hela was further along in her studies and her career, her achievements bigger and more important anyway, so it was understandable she might overlook Rio’s accomplishments while expecting admiration for her own. But as months went by, even Rio’s adulation wasn’t enough. No compliment was satisfactory, no celebration good enough. <em>Rio</em> wasn’t good enough.</p><p>In the end, Hela had broken up with Rio, and it had gutted her. She had very nearly started drinking again, so deep was her spiral, and only Alice’s intervention had stopped her. Alice had developed a permanent dislike for Hela after that, and nothing could sway her opinion, even years later.</p><p>She and Hela had dated again eighteen months after that first breakup. Their paths had crossed at a gig, both performing at a Christmas mass service. Over coffee and gingerbread cookies, Hela had taken ownership of her actions, and sworn that Rio was enough, and pleaded for her to try again.</p><p>So they had. And they broke up again, this time after only two months.</p><p>The third time had come a little over a year ago, when Hela called Rio to tell her that she was taking a job in Australia for twelve weeks. They had met up before Hela left, and decided to try long distance. It had worked surprisingly well, in Rio’s opinion, and when Hela returned to New York they had actually started looking at apartments to rent together. But the reality of their lives had set in, both of them obscenely busy with gigs and auditions. Hela had struggled to get roles, and it had made her bitter. Rio had felt guilty, breaking up with her when she was struggling, but she had made the best choice for her own mental health.</p><p>Since then they had hooked up a few times, but Rio had decided it would never be serious between them again. They were a combustible pair, always burning hot but leaving nothing but ash in their wake, and she knew it. But Hela’s charisma was like a magnet, and sexually she was safe, so somehow Rio kept finding her way back into the other woman’s orbit.</p><p>Rio’s phone rang, pulling her out of her thoughts. She accepted the call without looking at her screen and pressed the device to her head.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>“He doesn’t hate you.”</p><p>With just that simple sentence, Rio felt the tension bleed from her body. The effect was so strong that she felt tears bubble up in her eyes.</p><p>“Sure feels like it,” she mumbled, wiping her eyes.</p><p>“Tell me what happened,” Agatha said, her voice low and soothing.</p><p>Rio gave her a run down of everything they had done since leaving the dialysis appointment the day before. Agatha listened patiently, and once Rio was finished she sighed heavily.</p><p>“Sounds like he stayed up too late and then was still tired when you woke him up and wanted him to go out,” Agatha told her, but her voice wasn’t upset. “Rookie mistake.”</p><p>“He didn’t seem tired last night,” Rio replied. “He wanted to watch the second movie. And he got like… nine hours of sleep.”</p><p>"Did you make him leave his phone in the kitchen to charge overnight?" Agatha asked.</p><p>"No," Rio replied.</p><p>"Then I guarantee he didn't get nine hours of sleep," Agatha told her. "He probably stayed up for at least two more hours playing games and watching random videos on Youtube."</p><p>"Oh," Rio sighed.</p><p>“He doesn’t always know when he’s pushing himself to stay up too late,” Agatha continued. “And it doesn’t matter how many hours of sleep he gets if his schedule is thrown off.”</p><p>“I didn’t realize…” Rio began, biting her nail.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha soothed. “Like I said, rookie mistake. Hell, sometimes I forget. He was a bit more resilient to schedule changes before the kidney issues, too, that makes a difference.”</p><p>“So he hates me because he’s tired?” Rio asked.</p><p>“He doesn’t hate you,” Agatha repeated. “But he <em>is</em> incredibly irritable when he doesn’t get enough rest. Hopefully he’s napping right now and not playing video games, or he’ll still be a sourpuss when you try to take him to that rehearsal you have later.”</p><p>“Let me go check,” Rio said, hoisting herself up from the sofa. She made her way upstairs as quietly as she could, and gently pushed open the door to Nicky’s room. She found him sprawled out on the bed, his Nintendo beside him in sleep mode. She quietly closed the door back and tiptoed away from the door.</p><p>“Let me guess, out like a light?” Agatha asked, the fondness in her voice clear even over the phone line.</p><p>“Completely,” Rio replied, sitting on the sofa again. “Thanks for calling, by the way. I didn’t mean to bother you. I know you’re dealing with stuff with your mother.”</p><p>“Asking questions about Nicky isn’t bothering me,” Agatha told her. “And I needed—”</p><p>A loud crash echoed through the line, so loud that Rio had to hold the device away from her ear. When it quieted down, she moved the phone back.</p><p>“Agatha, you okay?” she asked.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, I have to go,” Agatha replied. “I—”</p><p>“Agatha!” came a shrill voice in the background of Agatha’s call. “Where are you? Useless little bitch, can’t even come help your mother. I never would’ve had a child at all if I had known they would be like you.”</p><p>“I have to go,” Agatha repeated, her tone despondent. For a moment, Rio could still hear voices, but they were farther away from the phone. “I’m right here, Mother, what—”</p><p>“Don’t touch me! I don’t want your disgusting hands on me, you filthy dyke!”</p><p>The line disconnected, and Rio was left staring, open mouthed, at the blinking device. She wasn’t supposed to hear that, and now that she had she felt… guilty, dirty, ashamed. Every one of Evanora’s words had been so thick with disgust, fury, and hate that even through the phone, even though she wasn’t the intended target, Rio’s insides felt uneasy.</p><p>It had to be worse for Agatha.</p><p>
<em>I think Grandma’s mean to her.</em>
</p><p>Nicky’s words now seemed like an understatement. Rio couldn’t fathom anyone speaking to their child like that, even as an adult. And, in Rio’s experience, anyone who spoke to their adult child like that had spoken to them the same way when they were children. Rio found her mind wandering, back to the images she had searched of when Agatha was younger, to teenage Agatha, and then her mind conjured up images of a little girl with wild brown hair and bright blue eyes. Rio wanted nothing more than to sweep her up in her arms and make her feel safe and loved.</p><p>Rio knew it was an absurd thought. Agatha was a grown woman, a powerful, successful woman with her life clearly in control. She wasn’t a child, and she wasn’t some damsel in need of protecting, even from her own hateful, homophobic mother.</p><p>But something about how Agatha’s tone had shifted when she spoke to her mother gave Rio pause. It was like a veil had been lifted, and laid bare a part of Agatha that Rio knew she wouldn’t want anyone to see, the soft white underbelly that she kept shielded from the world. It made something fierce and protective rise in Rio’s chest, and no matter how absurd she tried to tell herself it was, she couldn’t shake the feeling.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Carol and Maria’s apartment was already buzzing by the time Rio and Nicky arrived. Rio carefully squeezed through the front hallway, careful that she didn’t knock anything over with her bass, with Nicky following close behind her. Maria had snacks laid out on the kitchen island, and the living room furniture had all been pushed aside to make room for the instruments. Carol had set up her drum set and Maria’s trumpet was resting on the coffee table. A woman with long braids whom Rio had never met before was plugging in her keyboard. Rio shrugged off the shoulder straps of her bass case with a sigh, leaning the instrument up against the wall.</p><p>“Hey, glad you could make it!” Carol greeted them from the other side of the kitchen. She wiped her hands on a dishtowel before making her way over to them. “You must be Nicky. It’s nice to meet you.”</p><p>“Hello,” Nicky said softly, shifting nervously from one foot to the other.</p><p>“We’ve got snacks if you’re hungry,” Carol continued. “I’m Carol, that’s my wife Maria, and that’s our friend Val on the piano. Oh, and our daughter Monica’s out back in the garden. Make yourself at home.”</p><p>Rio led Nicky to the back of the apartment, to the small fenced-in area out behind the brownstone. As Agatha had predicted, he had been in a much better mood after getting a bit more sleep. Almost as soon as Rio woke him, he had started asking a plethora of questions about Rio’s bandmates and about Monica. As they had grown closer to the Brooklyn brownstone, however, the questions had slowed, and he had grown quieter and quieter.</p><p>Rio opened the sliding door and led Nicky out to a small garden. She had helped Carol lay pavers and install planters last spring, but now they were all barren of everything except cold soil and the vines that hung over the fence were dead and gray. But the dreary weather and chilly air wasn’t stopping the girl who stood in the middle of the yard, a soccer ball at her feet. Monica was twelve, so a bit older than Nicky, but Rio hoped they would get along.</p><p>“Hey Monica,” Rio said as she stepped into the garden.</p><p>“Hi Rio,” the girl greeted, looking up at her with a familiar smile.</p><p>Nicky was standing slightly behind Rio, and didn’t seem inclined to move. Rio raised a brow at him, but he wouldn’t meet her eyes, instead letting his long hair fall over his face shyly. Rio felt her heart squeeze at this unexpected shyness, and she gently tugged him forward and wrapped her arm around his shoulders.</p><p>“This is Nicky,” Rio said, nudging him with her hip.</p><p>“Hello,” Nicky muttered. Rio thought the only thing keeping him from bolting and hiding was her arm around him.</p><p>Monica just smiled. “Hi Nicky. Do you like soccer?”</p><p>Nicky’s face lit up. “Yeah!”</p><p>“Alright, let’s play then,” Monica replied, kicking the ball over to him.</p><p>Nicky dropped his backpack onto a nearby patio chair, and then started dribbling the ball between his feet before passing it to Monica. Rio watched as the two quickly fell into conversation while they kicked the ball around, and she smiled before heading back inside.</p><p>Rio had played with Maria and Carol many times before, but Val was a new addition. Even so, she fit in with the group easily, and the rehearsal flowed smoothly. Carol had invited Rio to play with the group shortly before her recital. They already had a regular gig lined up playing at a jazz club, once renovations on the place were finished. It would line up perfectly with Rio’s recovery from the kidney donation surgery, and since she planned on cutting back on her teaching assistant workload while she was finishing her dissertation, it would help make up for the lost income.</p><p>About an hour into practicing, as they finished a song, Carol let out a loud whoop.</p><p>“Damn, that was nice,” she said, reaching up to still her cymbals. She looked at Rio. “That slap bit on the end? Do that every time, it sounded great.”</p><p>“Yes, Captain,” Rio said with a mock salute. Carol and Maria had met when they played in the US Air Force band, and even though they were retired, Rio often jokingly referred to them by their former ranks.</p><p>They decided to take a snack break before starting another song, and the kids chose that moment to come inside. Nicky ran up to Rio, his cheeks flushed pink from the cold outside air.</p><p>“Rio, can I go to Monica’s room and play Switch? She has Mario Kart!”</p><p>“Yeah, of course you can, <em>mi</em>— <em>buddy</em>,” she said, catching herself.</p><p>Nicky’s brow wrinkled as he caught her switch, but before he could address it, Monica called him from the other side of the kitchen island, distracting him with the promise of chips and salsa. He loaded a plate with snacks before following the girl to her bedroom.</p><p>“You seem to be doing well with this whole parenting thing,” Maria commented with a smile. “It suits you.”</p><p>“I’m not parenting, just babysitting,” Rio scoffed. “And you didn’t see us this morning after I let him stay up too late last night. I was convinced that he hated me.”</p><p>“Let me guess, he took an afternoon nap, and when he woke up you were the coolest person in the world again?” Maria asked.</p><p>“Pretty much,” Rio nodded.</p><p>“Carol still makes that mistake regularly, and she’s been in Monica’s life since her conception. Isn’t that right, babe?”</p><p>“Oh, yeah, I fuck up regularly,” Carol nodded, her short blonde hair flopping into her face. “Thankfully, Maria is always there to smooth things over, and Monica’s always been a pretty easy kid. You’ll get there.”</p><p>“Wait, I’m confused,” Val said, looking at Rio. “I thought you were Nicky’s mom? Are you his stepmom? Because he looks just like you.”</p><p>“It’s… complicated,” Rio replied.</p><p>Carol snorted into her beer. “That’s putting it lightly.”</p><p>“I’m his biological mom,” Rio explained. “But I put him up for adoption when he was born. We only recently reconnected because he needs a kidney transplant, and I’m a match for donation. But his mom has agreed to let me get to know him and be part of his life.”</p><p>“Oh, wow, that is complicated,” Val said, whistling faintly.</p><p>“Oh, that’s not the most complicated part,” Carol said, finishing off her beer.</p><p>Maria placed a warning hand on Carol’s shoulder. “Babe, that’s not our business to share.”</p><p>Rio could feel herself blushing. Even sober Carol often lacked a filter between her mouth and her brain, but a few beers in and it was definitely gone. Rio definitely didn’t miss that part of drinking at all.</p><p>“You don’t have to tell me if it’s something personal,” Val said, her voice low.</p><p>Rio glanced down the hall toward Monica’s room. She could hear the sound of both children’s laughter and the television from here, so Nicky shouldn’t be able to hear her.</p><p>“I kind of hooked up with Nicky’s adoptive mother the weekend before I met him,” Rio said, her voice low.</p><p>“Oh shit!” Val hissed, eye wide.</p><p>“In our defence, neither of us knew we had that connection,” Rio explained quickly. “We met randomly at a gig I was playing and the chemistry was just instant.”</p><p>“So you’re dating on top of all the adoption and kidney stuff?” Val asked, clearly trying to piece the situation together.</p><p>“Oh god, no,” Rio replied with a dry, humorless laugh. “That would complicate things even more.”</p><p>It took her a moment to realize that nobody else was laughing with her.</p><p>“How so?” Val asked, just as Carol said, “Would it, though?”</p><p>Rio looked between them in confusion and shock.</p><p>“Don’t mess with her, you guys,” Maria chided. “I understand where you’re coming from. You’re figuring out this whole situation, and adding a romantic relationship on top of it would be a lot.”</p><p>“Exactly. Thank you,” Rio nodded. “And what if we did start something and it didn’t work out? That would make everything so awkward.”</p><p>“Isn’t it already awkward, though?” Carol asked. “I mean, I just don’t see how you can be around the woman without any temptation. I saw her at your recital and she’s hot.” Maria slapped Carol’s shoulder— hard. “Ouch! I was just making an observation, sweetheart, you know you’re the only woman for me!”</p><p>“And you better fucking remember it,” Maria muttered. Rio couldn’t help but grin at their banter.</p><p>“I’m just saying that <em>if I were Rio,</em>” Carol continued, emphasizing the hypothetical, “it would be really freaking difficult to be around a beautiful woman. Especially when I already knew what her pussy tasted like.”</p><p>Rio choked on her ginger ale, sputtering and spewing it all over her shirt. Maria went for a towel while Val patted her back.</p><p>“Christ, Captain, there are kids in the house,” Rio said between coughs.</p><p>“They’re too busy playing Mario Kart to hear me,” Carol replied with confidence, waving her hand dismissively. “You can’t tell me that you don’t think about it, Rio, come on.”</p><p>Rio glared at her as she dabbed at her shirt. “Okay, so I think about it. Doesn’t change anything.”</p><p>“I still don’t understand how dating your kid’s mom would be a bad idea,” Val said softly. “I mean, wouldn’t it be awesome if you guys ended up together?”</p><p>Rio paused for a moment as she indulged in a moment of fantasy, imagining her and Agatha together, living together, raising Nicky together, growing old together. It was a nice thought, that was for sure, but it was nothing more than that.</p><p>“Yes, but what if they didn’t work out?” asked Maria, always the realist. “If they started a romantic relationship and broke up, well… Best case scenario, it just makes things even more awkward than they are now. Worst case scenario, they can’t stand each other and Agatha shuts Rio out of her and Nicholas’s life.”</p><p>“Could she do that?” Val asked.</p><p>“Yeah, she could,” Rio replied. “I have no legal rights to him. So if Agatha wanted, she could tell me to fuck off.”</p><p>“Yeah, but that’s just… That would be a real shit move,” Carol said, sitting back in her chair and taking another sip of beer. “There’s a simple solution to that, though.”</p><p>“Oh, yeah?” Maria asked, raising her brow in question.</p><p>“What’s that?” Rio asked.</p><p>“You gotta marry her and then re-adopt Nicky,” Carol said simply. “And just don’t piss her off before the paperwork is filed.”</p><p>Val snorted and Maria rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Oh, yeah, real simple, babe,” Maria scoffed.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Goose is a silly name for a cat, don’t you think?”</p><p>Rio smiled at Nicky’s question. She was perched on the foot of his bed, a captive audience, as he brushed his teeth. Ever since they left Carol and Maria’s apartment, he had given her an endless rundown of everything he and Monica had done while she was rehearsing. Rio had quickly come to the conclusion that her ADHD and Agatha’s sheer talkativeness was an absolutely deadly combination.</p><p>“Did Monica tell you why they named her Goose?” she asked.</p><p>Nicky spit out his toothpaste. “No, she said Goose was older than her.”</p><p>“Carol and Maria adopted Goose right after they got married,” she explained. “They were visiting a farm and the barn cat had a litter of kittens. But she had them in the goose pen, and there was this big fat mama goose that had also hatched a bunch of goslings around the same time. When the mama cat was out hunting mice, the kittens would all snuggle under the mama goose like they were her babies. That’s why they called her Goose.”</p><p>“That’s really cute,” Nicky said with a grin.</p><p>“I agree.”</p><p>Nicky turned the water off and wiped his mouth. “So Carol and Maria are both Monica’s moms?”</p><p>“Yep,” Rio nodded.</p><p>Nicky crawled into bed and tugged at the covers. “And they’re married? To each other?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said, curious where this line of questioning was going. “You know what being gay means, right buddy?”</p><p>“Yeah, I know sometimes boys like boys and girls like girls.” He rolled his eyes. “And sometimes people can like both. And sometimes people don’t like anybody. And sometimes—”</p><p>“Okay, you’re familiar with the entire queer alphabet. I was just checking,” Rio said with a chuckle.</p><p>Nicky looked up at her with a serious expression. “Are you a lesbian, Rio?”</p><p>Rio reached down and ran her fingers through his hair. “Yes, Nicky, I’m a lesbian.”</p><p>“Mama’s a lesbian, too,” he said seriously.</p><p>“Yes, I know,” Rio replied, suddenly very anxious about what he was going to say next.</p><p>“So maybe you and Mama could get married, like Maria and Carol. And then you can both be my moms. You know… more than you are now.”</p><p>Rio’s heart ached in her chest. “Nicky… It’s not that simple.”</p><p>“Why not?” he asked. “You like Mama, don’t you?”</p><p>“You have to feel more than <em>like</em> to marry someone, sweetheart,” Rio told him.</p><p>“You have to <em>love</em> them,” he said confidently. “Don’t you think you could love Mama? She’s pretty great.”</p><p>“She is pretty great,” Rio chuckled. “But Nicky, it’s just… It’s very complicated, okay? There’s a lot of things to consider before you marry somebody, and your mama and I…”</p><p>She looked up at the ceiling, as if the plastic glow-in-the-dark stars could give her wisdom. Finally she looked back at the boy.</p><p>“You are the most important thing to your mama and me,” she said, poking him in the chest. “Even if we’re not married, we are both gonna be part of your life. We are both gonna love you and support you through everything, no matter what. Don’t you worry.”</p><p>“I know,” he said, sinking further down into the covers. “I just… I want Mama to be happy. And I want you to be happy, too, Rio. And I just thought maybe you two could be happy together, you know?”</p><p>“That’s really sweet, Nicky,” she said, bending to kiss his forehead. “Seriously, you’re the sweetest kid. Your mama and I are gonna have to be super careful when it rains to make sure you don’t melt, you’re that sweet.”</p><p>Nicky giggled as she tickled his sides lightly through the covers. Once he had settled, she kissed him one more time.</p><p>“Don’t you worry about grown up stuff like your mama and I getting married or not getting married,” she said. “You just live your life, and know that we’ll always be here loving you, okay?”</p><p>“Okay,” he replied, then yawned.</p><p>“Goodnight, sweet boy,” she said, standing and turning off the light before going to the door.</p><p>“Goodnight, Rio,” he murmured, his words slurred by exhaustion.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Rio awoke on Sunday morning to a text message from Agatha.</p><p>
<em><strong>Agatha</strong>: I’ll be home this evening. Might be late, it just depends on which flight I can get on.</em>
</p><p align="right">
<em>Good to hear. How’s your</em>
</p><p>Rio deleted that message without finishing it. She hadn’t forgotten what she had overheard when she spoke to Agatha the day before, and she hadn’t shaken the emotions it had brought out, either. Combined with her conversation with Nicky the night before, and she felt raw, like an exposed electrical wire, just waiting for something to spark.</p><p>She should probably give Agatha a heads up about what Nicky had said, now that she thought about it.</p><p align="right">
<em>Btw, Nicky thinks we should get married</em>
</p><p>She didn’t even type it in. The thought alone was enough to give her palpitations. Maybe talking to her was enough and he won’t bring it up again, but Rio doubted. Nicky’s too much like her, too much like Agatha, and neither of them was good at leaving well enough alone.</p><p align="right">
<em>Safe travels.</em>
</p><p>That was generic, but safe enough. Rio hit send before she could overthink it anymore, then dropped her phone in bed beside her. A few minutes later, there was a knock on the door.</p><p>“Rio? You awake?”</p><p>“Yeah, Nicky, come on in,” she called.</p><p>Nicky opened the door and a mischievous grin spread across his face. Suddenly he ran toward her and launched himself onto the bed, landing beside her in a flurry of giggles. Rio immediately grabbed him and pulled him to her side, tickling him as she did so, and his laughter kicked up an octave as he thrashed in her arms.</p><p>“No! Noooo! Stooooooop!” he squealed between giggles, and after a few seconds Rio gave in and stopped tickling him. Once he had settled down, he looked up at her with a bright smile. “Mama called and said she’s coming home today.”</p><p>“Mmhmm, she messaged me, too,” Rio told him, attempting to smooth down his wild bedhead. His long brown hair was sticking out in every direction, and no matter how Rio tried, it wouldn’t lie down.</p><p>“Does that mean you’re gonna go home?” he asked.</p><p>“Yeah, once your mama comes home, I’ll go back to my place,” Rio replied.</p><p>Nicky frowned. “But why can’t you just stay here? You can sleep in the guest room. And then we can watch movies and you can hear Mama read <em>Percy Jackson</em> and we can go out to breakfast on Saturdays…”</p><p>“Hey, we can still do those things,” Rio told him. “I’ll talk to your mama and I can come over for movie nights and we can go get breakfast… We can still do all the things, I promise. The only thing is that when we’re done, I’ll go back home to my apartment.”</p><p>“That’s just dumb,” Nicky huffed, turning and burying his face in the comforter.</p><p>Rio didn’t have a comeback for that. She pushed her tongue into her cheek, thinking. This was a complete one-eighty from the Nicky who she thought hated her less than twenty-four hours earlier, and for that she couldn’t be more grateful. But she also wasn’t sure how to address his current clinginess. So, she went for avoidance.</p><p>“Hey, you remember all that food we got at the farmer’s market yesterday? How would you like to help me make dinner so that when your mama comes home she has a nice homecooked meal, hmm?”</p><p>Nicky raised his face ever so slightly from the covers. “You know how to cook?”</p><p>“I mean… not much, I admit,” she replied. “But I was thinking I could show you how to make tostones and we can cook some pork chops with rice and beans. What do you think?”</p><p>“Sounds like a lot of work,” Nicky huffed, flopping over onto his back.</p><p>“Cooking can be a lot of work, but it feels good to make something for the people you love,” Rio told him. “I think your mama would appreciate it.”</p><p>“Okay. If you think Mama would like it.”</p><p>“I think you’ll like it, too,” Rio assured him. “Now, let’s get up. I think there are some frozen waffles in the kitchen calling our names.”</p><hr/><p> </p><p>When Agatha arrived home a little after ten that night, Rio was sitting on the sofa with a sleeping Nicky beside her, a forgotten stop-motion Christmas movie playing softly on the television. Rio had tried to get Nicky to go to bed an hour earlier, per Agatha’s instructions, but the boy had stubbornly refused, insisting that he would stay up to see Agatha when she got home. He had then immediately fallen asleep in a cocoon of blankets, his head resting on Rio’s lap.</p><p>The Agatha that came through the door looked so different from the Agatha she was used to that Rio did a double take. She wore leggings and a white tank top beneath a giant oversize cardigan. There was no makeup on her face, and the fine lines in her pale skin looked deeper than normal, the skin beneath her eyes was dark with exhaustion, and her thick brown hair was pulled back in a claw clip, curls dry and frizzy at the ends. For the first time in Rio’s experience, Agatha looked like a completely normal human being, albeit a very tired one.</p><p>Rio still thought she was beautiful.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to speak, but Rio raised a finger to her lips in warning before pointing down at Nicky. She hung her coat on the rack by the door and left her suitcase, stepping further into the living room. Sharp blue eyes took in the scene in front of her, and Rio could almost see the tension bleeding from her shoulders as she leaned onto the back of the sofa.</p><p>“Hi,” she whispered, giving Rio a soft smile. She reached down and stroked Nicky’s hair gently, careful not to wake him.</p><p>“Hi, yourself,” Rio whispered back. “I tried to get him to go to bed, but he was adamant that he was going to stay awake until you got home.”</p><p>“That sounds about right,” Agatha sighed. “I hope he didn’t worry too much.”</p><p>“I tried to keep him distracted,” Rio told her.</p><p>Agatha made her way around to the front of the sofa and perched on the edge beside Nicky.</p><p>“Nicky, sweetheart,” she said softly, gently shaking his shoulder. “Wake up, Mama’s home.”</p><p>Nicky whimpered, stubbornly clinging to sleep for a few moments, before his eyes slowly blinked open.</p><p>“Mama?” he murmured.</p><p>“Yes, sweet boy, I’m home,” Agatha said with a wide smile, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes.</p><p>Nicky wiggled free of the blankets and threw his arms around Agatha with a sigh.</p><p>“I missed you,” he murmured into her shoulder.</p><p>“I missed you, too,” Agatha replied. “Did you have fun with Rio?”</p><p>“Lots of fun. Rio should stay forever,” he declared. “We even made you dinner.”</p><p>“You cooked for me?” Agatha asked, looking between them.</p><p>“I helped,” Nicky told her. “Rio said I was the soup chef.”</p><p>“<em>Sous chef,</em>” Rio corrected with a chuckle. “I can heat up a plate for you, if you’d like?”</p><p>“No, that’s—” Agatha’s refusal was interrupted by her stomach growling so loudly that they could all hear it. Agatha’s cheeks flushed at the sound. “That sounds lovely, actually. Maybe you could do that while I get this little man tucked into bed?”</p><p>“Sounds good,” Rio replied. She bent over and kissed the top of Nicky’s head. “Goodnight, Nicky.”</p><p>“Goodnight, Rio.”</p><p>Rio made her way to the kitchen as Agatha ushered Nicky up the stairs to his bedroom. She put a plate of leftovers in the microwave and while it was heating up she started putting away the dishes from the dishwasher where she had washed them earlier.</p><p>“You really don’t have to do that.”</p><p>Rio looked up as Agatha trudged into the kitchen. She had lost the cardigan, and her hair was loose around her shoulders. She looked at the plate Rio had made for her before walking to the wine rack. She grabbed a bottle and a glass and sat down on the barstool with a tired huff.</p><p>“Well, when I stay somewhere, I try to leave it in the same condition as I found it,” Rio told her, watching as she poured a healthy amount of wine into her glass. “I washed and changed the sheets on the guestroom bed this afternoon. And since I dirtied these dishes cooking today, I should put them away before I go.” Rio gestured to the plate on the bar. “Eat, before it gets cold. I saved you a bit of everything except the tostones, but they’re not nearly as good if you reheat them.”</p><p>Agatha picked up her fork and took a bite of her food. A low moan echoed from the depths of her throat through the small space.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha hummed. “Rio, this is delicious.”</p><p>Rio smiled softly. “It’s just a porkchop with rice and beans.”</p><p>“The flavor is delicious,” Agatha commented, taking another bite. “And I’m not just saying that because I’m so hungry I could eat cardboard, either. I didn’t know you could cook.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t go that far,” Rio snorted. “I learned a few dishes from my mom before she died, and Lorna taught me some things when I lived with her and Alice. I can keep myself alive, but I wouldn’t call myself a chef by any stretch of the imagination.”</p><p>“Well, thank you for this,” Agatha said earnestly.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Rio replied. She placed the last of the utensils in the drawer at the end of the island. “I guess I should get out of your hair—”</p><p>Agatha grabbed her wrist as she walked by, stopping her in her tracks. When she turned to look at the other woman, she was frowning deeply and her eyes held a vulnerability Rio had never seen her wear before.</p><p>“Stay, please,” Agatha breathed. She looked down, seeming to realize that she had grabbed Rio, and released her hold on her arm. “Just for a bit… If you don’t mind.”</p><p>Rio nodded and rounded the counter to sit in the stool beside Agatha. They sat in silence for several long minutes as Agatha ate her food, Rio wiggling restlessly in her seat, before she couldn’t hold it in any longer.</p><p>“Agatha… when I picked Nicky up from school… what I said when I picked up the call…”</p><p>“When you said you were Nicky’s mother,” Agatha finished for her, scooping up a bite of beans and rice. “I heard you.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean—“</p><p>“I know what you meant,” Agatha said. “And you <em>are</em> his mother, Rio. You’re his biological mother, his birth-mother.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio agreed. “But, I mean, I didn’t want it to upset you. How I said it. I don’t want you to think…”</p><p>Agatha sighed and put down her fork. “Rio… like I said a few weeks ago, I don’t always share well. But for Nicky’s sake, I’m learning. I’m doing my best to make space for you in our lives, and to be okay with you having a special place in his heart. I won’t lie and pretend that you saying that didn’t rattle me, but I know what you meant.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean to upset you,” Rio told her.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha replied. “I don’t want you to feel like you have to walk on eggshells around me so you don’t upset me.”</p><p>“I don’t—“</p><p>“You’ve stopped calling Nicky <em>mijo</em>,” Agatha interrupted. “I’ve noticed. He’s noticed.”</p><p>Rio looked down at her lap. “I didn’t realize he had.”</p><p>“He asked me why, and I told him it was my fault,” Agatha replied, “because it is. Call him <em>mijo</em>. He likes it. It’s your thing.”</p><p>“You’re sure?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha nodded and picked up her fork again. “Actually, it was you calling me yesterday that gave me the reassurance that I needed.”</p><p>Rio looked at her quizzically. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“You were so flustered,” Agatha said with a chuckle. “And it just reminded me that yeah, you two are similar, you have this innate understanding of him for a lot of things, because you’re his mother. But I’m still his Mama. I know his little idiosyncrasies better than he knows them himself. The relationship between Nicky and I can’t be replicated or replaced. You two are going to have a relationship as well, and I truly hope it’s as strong and beautiful as the one he and I have, but it’s going to be different. And that’s okay.”</p><p>Rio studied her for a long moment. “How’d you get so smart?”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Years of therapy. Lilia insisted on it, it was basically a stipulation for my employment. She refused to work with an emotionally constipated bitch.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. She finally felt at peace with this odd co-parenting thing she and Agatha were figuring out.</p><p>“How’s your mother?” she asked, though she wanted to smack herself as soon as the words left her mouth. They had just come to a peaceful resolution and she had to bring that up. It was a polite thing to ask, sure, but after what she had overheard the day before Rio really didn’t give a rat’s ass about Evanora Harkness. She did, however, care about Agatha, and the woman beside her looked like she had been through the ringer while she was gone.</p><p>Agatha stabbed a piece of pork with a bit more force than necessary, spinning the meat in the air in front of her before placing it back on her plate uneaten.</p><p>“Speaking of emotional constipation,” she murmured before answering. “My mother is dying. Heart failure, shockingly enough, considering many people think she doesn’t actually have a heart. She’s had coronary artery disease for years, but now it’s getting to the end stages. This trip was basically transitioning her over to hospice care and making sure all of the end of life directives were in place.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened in sympathy. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“I’m not,” Agatha said quickly, taking a sip of her wine. She swirled what was left in the glass before downing it in one gulp and reaching for the bottle to refill the glass. “That must sound terrible. Is it bad that all I feel is relief?”</p><p>“No,” Rio replied. “I know dementia is a horrible thing. And after what she said to you yesterday—”</p><p>Agatha chuckled darkly. “I was afraid you overheard that.” She took another sip of her wine. “Believe me when I say that Mother was entirely lucid when she said those things. In fact those were fairly tame insults compared to what she normally calls me, but there were nurses around.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped. “I— What?”</p><p>Agatha downed her second glass of wine in record time, pouring a third before seeming to remember she still had food on her plate. She scooped up another bite as she spoke.</p><p>“My mother hates me, Rio, always has,” she explained. “She always says it started the moment I was born, but I’m fairly certain she hated me while she was pregnant as well. And me being a lesbian? That just gave her even more reason to despise me.”</p><p>Rio stared at Agatha in shock as she finished eating, as if she hadn’t just dropped a bombshell on her. Rio knew she must look something like a fish, opening and closing her mouth over and over again as her mind searched for something to say, but nothing came.</p><p>“I can’t imagine a mother hating her own child,” she said finally, lamely.</p><p>“Believe me, it happens more often than you’d think,” Agatha said, pushing her empty plate away from her. “Mother never wanted children, not really, but it was expected of her. So when she fell pregnant with me, she wanted a son, so that she could be one and done. It was a difficult pregnancy: she was sick the entire nine months, she retained fluid and swelled, and she never quite recovered her figure afterward. Not to mention how the hormones destroyed her mental health. And after all that, I had the audacity to be born female.</p><p>“Mother had two more pregnancies, and both ended in a miscarriage,” she continued. “The second was an ectopic pregnancy, and the damage done made it impossible for her to have any more children. The way my mother saw it, she had failed at her one duty to give my father a son. She needed someone to blame, and rather than internalizing it, she turned it on me.”</p><p>“That’s terrible,” Rio scoffed. “Surely your father didn’t blame anyone?”</p><p>“If my father wanted a son, he never told me,” she replied. “Maybe he said it to my mother, but he never made me feel like he would’ve preferred a son over a daughter. He called me his princess, and said that being my father made him feel like he was king of the world.”</p><p>“You were a daddy’s girl, then?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Oh, most definitely,” Agatha said with a grin. “And Mother hated me for it. She said I stole my father from her. His time, his love, his admiration all fell to me rather than her. Looking back, I know that wasn’t true. Father still gave her attention, but it wasn’t enough for her, and any attention that he showed me was too much.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t sit still anymore. She wanted to reach out and touch Agatha in some way, but instead she stood up and took Agatha’s empty plate around to the sink and rinsed it. When she finished she came back to Agatha’s side, leaning against the counter as she wiped her hands on a dishtowel.</p><p>Agatha ran her fingertip around the edge of her wine glass. “Maybe I am a horrible daughter. What else can I be if I don’t even feel sad about my mother’s imminent death?”</p><p>“I don’t think you’re horrible,” Rio told her honestly. “I mean, just from what little you’ve told me, she sounds like a terrible mother. A lot of people would’ve just said fuck her and gone no contact. But you dropped everything this weekend to go to her and make sure she was taken care of and all her affairs are in order. That doesn’t sound like a horrible daughter to me.”</p><p>Agatha looked contemplative. Her long hair fell into her face, obscuring her eyes, and Rio couldn’t help herself. She reached up and tucked the strand behind Agatha’s ear, and as she brought her hand back she couldn’t help but run her fingers over the soft skin of her cheek, the sharp line of her jaw, the soft pink of her lips.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said, her voice soft and breathless. Rio wasn’t sure if it was a warning or a plea.</p><p>“You’re not horrible, Agatha,” she said. “You’re good. You’re actually pretty amaz—”</p><p>In a blink, Agatha’s lips were on hers, soft and warm and tasting of spices and wine. Agatha’s hand twisted in the front of Rio’s shirt, pulling her closer as she stood and pressed her back into the wall of cabinets behind her. Rio gasped as her back hit the sleek wood, and Agatha took advantage, slipping her tongue past Rio’s lips. Her hands released Rio’s shirt and instead slid beneath the hem, finding purchase on the skin beneath. Rio’s breath hitched as Agatha firmly gripped her waist, her nails digging in ever so slightly as she continued to kiss her.</p><p>
<em>This was happening.</em>
</p><p>Rio moaned as she wrapped her arms around Agatha’s shoulders. She buried her fingers in the long strands of Agatha’s hair, pulling ever so slightly until Agatha whimpered into her mouth. Agatha’s hands pushed up at Rio’s shirt, as if she wanted to take it off, but she wouldn’t break the kiss to do so. Instead she pressed her knee between Rio’s legs and her hands slid back down to her hips, pulling her closer until the seam of Rio’s pants hit in just the right spot.</p><p>Rio broke the kiss to gasp. “Fuck! Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were wild as they met Rio’s, and Rio thought she saw a flash of realization, a moment of hesitation that disappeared just as quickly as it came, before the brunette lowered her head to Rio’s neck, kissing and sucking at the skin there. Rio groaned, again tugging at Agatha’s hair with one hand as the other trailed down her back, nails leaving red marks in the skin left bare by her tank-top.</p><p>“Yes, Agatha, so good, so, <em>so good,</em>” Rio gasped, grinding her hips. Every nerve ending was ablaze, every single cell attuned to the woman pressed against her. They should’ve done this sooner. Rio could barely remember why they hadn’t. Why on earth had she thought this was a bad idea? How could this ever be wrong when it felt so right?</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha murmured into her neck, her voice soft and breathless. She murmured Rio’s name between sucking deep kisses on the skin of her neck and chest. “Rio, Rio, Rio…”</p><p>Rio didn’t want her kisses on her neck, she wanted them on her lips. She tugged at Agatha’s hair again, pulling a deep groan from the woman, as she raised her head up to meet Rio’s gaze. Rio stared into her eyes, so blue and bright and vulnerable. Her gaze fell to Agatha’s lips, kiss-swollen and pink. She couldn’t remember ever wanting anything or anyone the way she wanted Agatha Harkness.</p><p>But there was a reason she couldn’t have her. A very good reason.</p><p>“We shouldn’t do this,” Rio said. She barely recognized the breathless voice that came out of her mouth, but she knew it was hers. “We can’t do this, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha moved so that her leg was no longer between Rio’s, but she didn’t pull away entirely. Instead she stood there, still in Rio’s arms, and Rio could practically see the reason returning to her mind. She dropped her head, forehead resting against Rio’s, as she took deep, sobering breaths.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she husked out between breaths.</p><p>“Don’t be,” Rio said quickly. Instead of letting Agatha go, she tightened her grip around her neck, her hands digging into the soft skin on her shoulders. She knew she needed to let go, but she didn’t want to. “It’s okay. We’re both human. At least we had the presence of mind to stop before doing anything we would regret.”</p><p>“Regret,” Agatha repeated, her voice growing stronger but harsher. “Right.”</p><p>She stepped away from Rio then, leaning against the kitchen island behind her. The cold air of the kitchen hit Rio’s face, sobering her up even more— she may not have had alcohol, but kissing Agatha was perhaps even more intoxicating.</p><p>“I should go,” Rio said, though there was nothing she wanted less.</p><p>“I can call Clint to pick you up,” Agatha suggested.</p><p>“No, that’s okay, it’s late,” Rio replied. She pushed herself away from the cabinet and hurried from the kitchen, through the dining room to where her duffel bag was waiting beside the door. “I’ll just hail a cab. It’ll be fine.”</p><p>“You sure?” Agatha asked, following a few steps behind.</p><p>Rio was already reaching for the doorknob. “I’m sure.”</p><p>She stepped into the hallway and took a deep breath before turning to close the door. Agatha was there, her hand already on the doorknob, looking at Rio with those eyes that so enchanted her, now filled with uncertainty.</p><p>“Are we okay?” Agatha asked, her voice soft.</p><p>Rio felt herself melting. “Yeah. Yeah, of course.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Okay. Goodnight, Rio.”</p><p>“Goodnight, Agatha,” she replied as the door swung shut. “<em>Te veo.</em>”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe you kissed her!”</p><p>Rio groaned as she loaded her cello into the back of the taxi cab. It had been ten days since Agatha kissed her. Since she kissed Agatha. Whatever, semantics. Ten days of vacillating between avoidance and forced normalcy, between desire and repression. Ten days of Rio feeling like she was suffocating on the inside while continuing to live as if everything were fine on the outside.</p><p>She had gotten through exam week, she had finished her Christmas shopping, she had played four holiday gigs, and she had done it all without letting on that anything was amiss. She kept busy, because in every spare moment her mind was full of <em> Agatha Agatha Agatha. </em>She replayed every interaction with the woman, weighing her emotions, trying to be logical about the whole situation.</p><p>Even though Rio liked rules and patterns, when it came to emotions, logic was not her strong suit. She was far more likely to follow her gut or her heart and deal with whatever consequences came from it.</p><p>She couldn’t do that in this case.</p><p>Rio had made the plan to give Nicky up for adoption months before his actual birth. But when they placed him in her arms, for a brief moment, every fiber of Rio’s being screamed to keep him. She had never wanted anything so badly in her life, and yet logically she had known that it would be better for both of them if she gave him to someone who could give him the life he deserved. Now, almost ten years later, she knew she had made the right decision.</p><p>And now, again, she was in a similar situation. A very big part of her said she should throw caution to the wind and pursue a romantic relationship with Agatha. But then another voice reminded her of how much she could lose if she did and things went sour.</p><p>Call her a coward, but Rio couldn’t take that risk.</p><p>So she had bottled her feelings up inside and ignored them. And for two weeks she had managed to avoid confronting them, partially because she had avoided Agatha entirely. She hadn’t spoken to the other woman, though she had called and texted with Nicky. But when he had invited her over for a movie a week after the kiss, she had subtly declined, and when he asked if she could meet one day for lunch, she had made up an excuse. When Agatha had texted her with a question about her Christmas plans, Rio hadn’t even made an excuse, she had just ignored it.</p><p>Okay, so maybe she <em> was </em>a coward.</p><p>She hadn’t even told Alice until tonight, when it had slipped out halfway through their set, somewhere between <em> Santa Baby </em> and <em> Jingle Bell Rock. </em></p><p>Alice hadn’t shut up since.</p><p>“Can you please drop it? This is why I didn’t tell you until now,” Rio grumbled, sliding into the cab beside her friend. She was too tired and too sober for this conversation.</p><p>“So are you two dating now or what?” Alice demanded.</p><p>“God, no,” Rio scoffed. “I already told you, we decided not to pursue any kind of romantic relationship.”</p><p>“Right, right, I got that. But then you made out in Agatha’s kitchen,” Alice said, the pitch of her voice climbing as she spoke. “So forgive me if I’m having a hard time following the plot.”</p><p>“It was a moment of weakness. A mistake,” Rio explained. “It won’t happen again.”</p><p>“Uh-huh, sure,” Alice replied skeptically. “And I have some oceanfront property in Arizona that I can sell you.”</p><p>“Oh my god, why are we friends? You’re so annoying!”</p><p>“Because we almost kissed once and couldn’t go through with it because we were laughing too hard at the absurdity of it,” Alice reminded her. “Also because your crazy matches my crazy, and nobody else could possibly tolerate our bullshit.”</p><p>Rio snorted. “All solid points.”</p><p>“Seriously, though, what are you gonna do about this?” Alice asked.</p><p>“This what?” Rio deflected.</p><p>Alice let out an exasperated sigh. “Your attraction to Agatha. The fact that you like her. The fact that you kissed her. The fact that you fucked her. The fact that you want to fuck her again. The fact that you’re a useless lesbian who only thinks with her clit.”</p><p>“Okay, okay, <em> shush, </em>” Rio said, glancing from Alice to the taxi driver. The man looked half asleep and completely unbothered by their conversation. “You made your point.”</p><p><em> “Unless,” </em>Alice said, her voice dropping. Rather than finish her thought, she turned to look at Rio, her dark eyes narrowed in scrutiny.</p><p><em> “Unless </em>what?” Rio pressed.</p><p>“Unless your feelings for Agatha are more than just… horny,” Alice shrugged, still watching her with keen eyes.</p><p>“Be serious, Alice,” Rio scoffed.</p><p>“I am being serious,” Alice rebuffed. “If what you’re feeling for Agatha is more than just physical attraction, then you might need to rethink your plan to not pursue anything with her.”</p><p>“Alice, ever since Nicky came into my life, you’ve been constantly warning me not to do anything with Agatha,” Rio pointed out. “You know why we’re not pursuing anything. That’s like… the number one rule here.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, sometimes circumstances change and rules have to change with them,” Alice told her. “You definitely like her.”</p><p>“What am I, twelve?”</p><p>“Rio,” Alice chided.</p><p>“Fine, yes, I like her, we’ve established that,” Rio sighed.</p><p>“But do you love her?” Alice asked.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to deny it, but she couldn’t bring herself to say the words. She looked away from Alice, out the window to the light snow that had started falling outside. Each flake glittered for just a moment in the glow from the lights before disappearing into the darkness again and melting on the concrete.</p><p>For Rio, affection and attraction were often like that: a fleeting glimmer that faded just as quickly into nothingness. She didn’t do long term relationships, not as a rule, but simply because she wasn’t programmed that way. That was another reason she had been against pursuing anything with Agatha. With her track record, the relationship failing was far more likely than it lasting.</p><p>But what she was feeling for Agatha? Rio wasn’t sure if it was love, was afraid to call it that. But it wasn’t fleeting. It wasn’t a glimmer, it wasn’t a spark, it was a <em> burning </em>. It was an ember that, no matter how she tried to cover it up, kept roaring back to a blaze that set her entire soul on fire.</p><p>“Rio?” Alice asked, pulling her back out of her thoughts.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio replied, but the words didn’t feel completely true.</p><p>“Well, I think you owe it to yourself to figure it out,” Alice said softly. “And you owe it to Agatha, and Nicky, too.”</p><p>Rio shifted uncomfortably in her seat. The cab finally came to a stop in front of their building, and Alice paid the driver as Rio retrieved her cello from the trunk. As they made their way up to the apartment, Alice sighed dramatically.</p><p>“What?” Rio asked as she unlocked the door.</p><p>“Just promise me you won’t do anything stupid while I’m in California with mom,” Alice said as the lights flickered on.</p><p>Rio stared at her friend across the living room. Alice was leaving the next morning to spend Christmas with Lorna.. “Alice, you’re only going for two weeks. What could possibly happen?”</p><p>Alice raised her brow skeptically.</p><p>“Fine, fine, I promise to be on my best behavior,” Rio grumbled. “Scout’s honor.”</p><p>“You were never a fucking scout,” Alice muttered.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Rio hurried into the lobby of Agatha’s building on the Saturday before Christmas with her heart hammering in her chest. She looked down at her phone again, as if the text message hadn’t been branded into her retinas on the thirty-minute subway ride over.</p><p><b> <em>Nicky:</em> </b> <em> Emergency! Come to our apartment ASAP! </em></p><p>She had attempted to call the boy twice before she got onto the subway, but he hadn’t answered. Then she had tried to call Agatha once she got off the subway, but Agatha hadn’t answered either. So here she was, sprinting down the short hallway to Agatha’s door, every possible horrible scenario flashing through her head. She knocked on the door and panted, trying to catch her breath, as she waited for it to open.</p><p>The door swung open a moment later, and Rio looked down with relief to find Nicky beaming up at her, a gleeful expression on his face.</p><p>“Rio! You came!” he exclaimed, wrapping his arms around her waist.</p><p>“Of course I came, <em> mijo, </em>you said it was an emergency,” Rio replied as he released her and dragged her into the apartment. She knelt down in front of him and checked him over, looking for any sign of illness or injury. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” he said, looking suddenly sheepish.</p><p>“Nicky, what— <em> oh!” </em></p><p>Agatha stepped out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on a towel. Her hair was up in a messy bun, and she wore an apron that was covered in splotches of flour. What surprised Rio most about her appearance, however, was the large pair of tortoiseshell glasses on her nose. And, <em> oh, </em> Rio didn’t know why, but seeing Agatha in glasses did something unholy to her insides.</p><p>
<em> Level up: New kink unlocked. </em>
</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Agatha asked. She looked surprised and just as confused as Rio about why Rio was in her apartment.</p><p>“I texted her and asked if she could come bake Christmas cookies with us!” Nicky told her, looking at Rio with pleading eyes.</p><p>
<em> Yeah, no such luck, kiddo. </em>
</p><p>“Actually, Nicky texted me that there was an emergency and I needed to come here ASAP,” Rio replied, pulling up the message thread on her phone and showing it to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha looked at the phone and frowned, then looked at her son. “Nicky—”</p><p>“Please don’t be mad, Mama,” Nicky whined.</p><p>“You lied to Rio!” Agatha chastised.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Nicky said, then he looked at Rio. “I’m sorry, Rio, I am. But you never want to hang out anymore.”</p><p>“That’s not true, I always want to hang out with you!” Rio argued.</p><p>“We haven’t hung out in <em> forever,” </em>Nicky whined. “It’s been two whole weeks!”</p><p>Rio bit the inside of her cheek. She could see Agatha doing the calculations in her head, and she knew the moment the woman realized exactly when the last time they had <em> hung out </em>had been.</p><p>“Nicky, this is a busy time of year for everyone,” Rio told him, trying to regain some control of the conversation before it spiraled out of control.</p><p>“But it’s <em> Christmas!” </em>Nicky said, his voice rising higher with every syllable. “Christmas is for family! And I thought we were a family now.”</p><p>Rio bit down harder on her cheek, trying to fight the tears bubbling up in her eyes. She was trying so hard not to fuck this up and here she was fucking it up anyway…</p><p>“Nicky, I need you to go to your room for a few minutes,” Agatha said, her voice dangerously calm.</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“No buts,” Agatha told him. “Rio and I need to have a grown up conversation. We’ll call you back down when we’re finished, okay?”</p><p>“Fine,” Nicky harrumphed. But before he went upstairs, he wrapped his arms tight around Rio’s waist again. “I’m really sorry for lying, Rio.”</p><p>Before Rio could formulate a reply he was gone, his feet thumping heavily up the wooden stairs to his room. Rio looked up after him, but her vision was blurry, and she realized that his hug had brought even more tears to the surface. She reached up and wiped them away irritably.</p><p>“Come sit down,” Agatha said, placing a hand on her elbow and guiding her around the sofa to sit. Agatha perched herself on the edge of a chair across from Rio, careful not to get any flour on the upholstery.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to upset him. I—“ Her voice caught in her throat. Agatha was looking at her with a mixture of irritation and dismay. Rio wasn’t sure what to say, and for a long moment her mouth wordlessly opened and closed until—</p><p>“I didn’t know you wore glasses.”</p><p>And <em> fuck </em>that wasn’t what she meant to say but her brain short-circuited and that’s what came out.</p><p>Agatha blinked owlishly at her. “Only for reading. ”</p><p>“Oh, wow. Well, they look nice.” <em> Oh my god, shut up, shut up! </em></p><p>Agatha reached up and slowly removed her glasses, folding them and placing them on the coffee table. Rio felt completely unfounded disappointment.</p><p>“You’ve been avoiding me,” Agatha said finally. It was a statement, not a question.</p><p>“I didn’t realize it had been two weeks,” Rio lied. “I just—” <em> couldn’t talk to you without thinking of how soft your lips are </em>“— lost track of time.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a long moment before she spoke again. “And this has nothing to do with what happened the last time you were here?”</p><p>“No.” <em> Yes. </em>“Of course not.”</p><p>“I shouldn’t have kissed you. It crossed a line, and if you’re regretting it—”</p><p>“I don’t regret it,” Rio interrupted. Agatha didn’t look like she believed it. “Why would you think I regret it?”</p><p>“Well, you said…”</p><p>Rio’s mind raced. She had replayed that kiss multiple times in her mind, but never given much thought to the conversation afterwards.</p><p>“I didn’t mean…” Rio took a deep breath. “I don’t regret that, Agatha. I don’t regret kissing you, and in case you were wondering, I don’t regret what happened the night of <em> Tarot’s </em>gala, either.”</p><p>Agatha looked surprised at that. “You don’t?”</p><p>“No, I don’t,” Rio replied. “But it has made things real fucking complicated.”</p><p>“Is that why you’re keeping your distance?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Rio sighed, deciding honesty was the best policy. “Yes. Yes, okay?”</p><p>“You don’t have to do that,” Agatha assured her. “It won’t happen again.”</p><p>“See, that’s the problem. You set these rules and then you break them,” Rio told her. “You’re the one who said <em> it could never happen again </em> the day I brought Nicky home and we realized who we are to each other. But then <em> you </em> were the one to kiss <em> me.” </em></p><p>“It won’t happen again,” Agatha repeated, this time with more fervor.</p><p>Rio paid her no mind. “And you breaking the rules isn’t even the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that I want you to.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows furrowed in confusion. “You want me to what?”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter,” Rio said, shaking her head. She had let too much slip.</p><p>“I think it does,” Agatha argued.</p><p>“No, it doesn’t,” Rio insisted. “It doesn’t matter because <em> this,” </em> she gestured between herself and Agatha, “can’t get any more complicated. I can’t risk it. I just got back into Nicky’s life and I can’t— <em> won’t </em>jeopardize that for anything. Do you understand that?”</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a long moment, studying her features, before her eyes hardened with resolve. “I understand. And you’re right. Nicky loves having you in his life. I won’t be the reason he loses that. You have my word.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Okay.”</p><p>“You don’t have to keep your distance,” Agatha continued. “We’re both adults. We can put this all behind us and move forward with no strings attached. For Nicky.”</p><p>“For Nicky,” Rio agreed, even as her heart sank. Stupid irrational organ. This was what she wanted.</p><p>“On one hand, I’m loath to reward him for misleading you,” Agatha said, moving on from their conversation. “But if you’re free and want to stay, we’re elbow deep in cookie dough, and I have an extra apron.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio replied, but her voice was shaky so she tried again with more certainty. “Sure, yeah, I’d love that.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Nicky! You can come back down now!”</p><p>Nicky ran back down the stairs with all the grace of a newborn giraffe, practically bouncing as he hit the landing.</p><p>“Are you gonna stay, Rio?” he asked, leaning dramatically over the back of the sofa. “Pleeeeeeease?”</p><p>Rio wiped her eyes one more time before leveling Nicky with a firm stare. “Yes, I’m going to stay, but—”</p><p>Nicky interrupted her with a victorious shout, pumping his fist in the air before launching himself over the back of the sofa. He wrapped his arms awkwardly around her middle while giggling uncontrollably.</p><p>“Nicky, you need to listen to what Rio is saying,” Agatha warned, her voice a low growl.</p><p>Nicky contorted himself into a more comfortable position, still pressed against Rio’s side like he was trying to melt into her.</p><p>“You can’t tell me it’s an emergency when it’s not really urgent, <em> mijo, </em>” Rio continued. “Do you know how worried I was? I thought you were sick, or that something had happened to you or your Mama.”</p><p>Nicky’s eyes widened. “You did?”</p><p>“Yes!” Rio exclaimed. “That’s what emergency usually means, Nicky. It’s not just so you can make me come visit you whenever you want.”</p><p>Nicky looked down at his lap. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make you worry. I just missed you, that’s all.”</p><p>Rio kissed his cheek. “I missed you, too, <em> mijo. </em>And I’m sorry I didn’t visit sooner. I just got busy and I got caught up in grown up things. But I promise to make more time for you, especially with the holidays and your surgery coming up, okay?”</p><p>“You really promise?” Nicky asked.</p><p>“I really promise,” Rio nodded. “This is gonna be the best Christmas ever because we’re gonna spend it together.”</p><p>“As a family,” Nicky declared.</p><p>Rio looked up at Agatha. “Yeah. Our weird little family.”</p><p>“It’s not weird,” Nicky argued. “It’s just… ours.”</p><p>Before Rio could reply and get even more sappy, a bitter smell filled her nostrils, and she saw the expression on Agatha’s face change as it hit her as well. A split second later, an alarm started blaring from the kitchen.</p><p>“Shit! I forgot to set the damn timer!” Agatha exclaimed, hurrying into the kitchen. Rio and Nicky followed on her heels as she ran to the oven and opened it, releasing a cloud of smoke. “Fuck… FUCK!”</p><p>“Mama, that’s four dollars for the swear jar,” Nicky remarked.</p><p>Agatha put on an oven mitt and removed a tray of triangular-shaped black blobs from the oven. “Well, that batch is ruined. Motherfucking—”</p><p>“Five dollars,” Nicky said, and Agatha shut her mouth.</p><p>Rio bit back a giggle as she fanned the kitchen with an apron she found hanging beside the fridge. "Since when do you have a swear jar?"</p><p>"It was Auntie Lilia's idea," Nicky explained.</p><p>"Of course it was," Rio muttered at the same time as Agatha said, "She's not your aunt."</p><p>Nicky ignored both of them. "I kind of got in trouble for saying bad words at school."</p><p>Rio gasped dramatically. "Nicholas Harkness!"</p><p>"It was just the s-word," he huffed. "Lilia said it was no surprise that I cussed because Mama cusses All the time."</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha, who was fiddling with the stove's exhaust fan and still muttering curses under her breath. "Yeah, that checks out."</p><p>"So Lilia said we should make a swear jar," Nicky told her. "Every time somebody says a bad word they have to put a dollar in the jar."</p><p>"How much money is in the jar so far? And how long have you been doing this?" Rio asked.</p><p>"Mmm... about fifty dollars," Nicky said. "And we've had the jar for a week."</p><p>"And how many of those dollars are from you?" Rio asked.</p><p>"Maybe four?"</p><p>That math checked out.</p><p>"Aha! Success!" Agatha exclaimed as the exhaust fan finally whirred to life and the smoke began to clear from the room. Rio put down the apron she had been fanning and looked around. There was another batch of dough waiting to be rolled out on one end of the counter, and unmixed ingredients were laid out on the other.</p><p>“What flavor were those?” Rio asked, once most of the smoke had finally cleared.</p><p>“Oatmeal raisin,” Agatha replied. Nicky stuck out his tongue in disgust.</p><p>“Not a huge loss, then,” Rio commented.</p><p>“Hey, don’t insult my favorite cookie,” Agatha argued as she dumped the blackened cookies into the trash can.</p><p>“Your favorite cookie is oatmeal raisin?” Rio clarified. “Are you sixty?”</p><p>Nicky giggled and Agatha looked at her with an offended expression. She took a spoon from the bowl and pointed it accusingly at Rio.</p><p>“How fucking dare you?”</p><p>“Six dollars,” Nicky noted, but Agatha ignored him.</p><p>“I’m just saying, AARP called and they want their cookies back,” Rio continued to tease as she put on the apron.</p><p>“Just for that, you don’t get to lick the spoon,” Agatha told her, returning said spoon to the bowl with a plop.</p><p>Rio smirked. “I’d like to see you try and stop me.”</p><hr/><p> </p><p>The heat from the stage lights was blazing hot as it beat down on Rio’s skin. She didn’t know how long she had been playing, just that her fingertips were sore in spite of the callouses, and her muscles ached from the strain. Her hair was coming loose, falling annoyingly into her face, but she just ignored it and just continued to play. With every drag of her bow across the strings the vibrations pulsed through the instrument, dancing across her sweaty bare skin like… like…</p><p>
<em> Her bare skin… </em>
</p><p>Rio’s bow strokes faltered as she focused her senses. She was naked, head to toe nude, as she sat on the brightly lit stage, her cello barely concealing her body. Her heart hammered in her chest as she tried to make sense of it, playing the final cadence of the piece.</p><p>A sharp clap filled the auditorium, followed by another. Rio’s eyes darted up at the command. Her eyes squinted against the bright lights, just barely able to make out row upon row of empty seat until her eyes landed on one lone figure seated in the center of the auditorium, their hands meeting in singular but thunderous applause.</p><p>
<em> Agatha. </em>
</p><p>“Another,” Agatha commanded.</p><p>Rio placed her bow back on the strings and went back to playing, the familiar Hozier melody filling the hall. As she played she felt warm breath on the back of her neck and suddenly there were hands on her, strong fingers digging into the skin of her waist.</p><p>“Keep playing,” Agatha ordered, her voice low and gravelly in Rio’s ear.</p><p>Rio’s fingers continued moving up and down the neck of the cello as Agatha’s lips pressed against the skin behind her ear. She kissed her way down Rio’s neck as her fingers trailed up Rio’s stomach to cup her breasts. Rio’s breath caught in her throat and her bow dipped erratically as Agatha palmed her breasts, her fingertips ghosting over her nipples before tugging them gently.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered breathlessly as her playing faltered again.</p><p>“Keep going,” Agatha coaxed, nipping at her shoulder even as she squeezed Rio’s breasts. Rio shuddered, trying to focus on her playing. She managed to make it through the chorus, even as Agatha’s hands continued their teasing exploration.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha praised, and her hand dipped down further, skimming over Rio’s stomach until her fingers brushed against her folds. “Oh, sweetheart, you’re absolutely dripping for me.”</p><p>Rio whimpered, her bow shuddering against the strings. She was almost to the end of the song, and her body was strung just as tightly as the bowstring. She spread her legs further as Agatha’s fingers dipped into her sex.</p><p>“Finish the song and I’ll let you finish,” Agatha said, and Rio felt something warm and wet against her ear— Agatha’s tongue. Agatha’s fingers teased through her sex, not quite hitting where she needed. She squirmed, trying to focus on playing while also focusing on the feeling of Agatha’s fingers. The brunette’s other hand wasn’t idle, still teasing at first one breast and then the other, rolling her nipples between her fingers.</p><p>“Please, Agatha,” Rio begged, as she began playing the final chorus.</p><p>“That’s it,” Agatha murmured, her teeth biting down on the spot where Rio’s neck met her shoulder as her fingers began circling her clit relentlessly. “You’re so close…”</p><p>“So close,” Rio repeated breathlessly, her head dropping back against Agatha’s shoulders as her hips began bucking. She could still hear the music playing, but she wasn’t sure if it was her own hands doing the work. She felt something cold hit her forehead, but her mind clung to the feeling of Agatha’s body behind her, the throbbing of her clit as Agatha circled it, the rasp of the sheets against her breasts…</p><p>Another cold droplet hit her forehead, and Rio opened her eyes with a gasp. She was in her bed, in her apartment, <em> alone </em>. Her tank top had slid to the side, so her tits were hanging out, and her nipples were rock hard beneath the sheets. Her skin was covered in a thin sheen of sweat, and between her legs…</p><p>Rio groaned, her body still throbbing from the dream. Before she could think better of it, she reached for her nightstand and dug out the first vibrator she could find and shoved it past the elastic waistband of her boxers. She was absolutely soaked, her clit swollen and throbbing. She turned the vibrator on and circled her clit, still thinking about how dream-Agatha had touched her. If she focused she could almost smell the older woman’s perfume, could still feel the ghost of her breath and her lips against her neck.</p><p>
<em> So wet for me, that’s it sweetheart, come for me, good girl, yes, come for me… </em>
</p><p>She came with a shout, her body going taut as pleasure pulsed through her veins. All the while, her mind conjured nothing but Agatha, her voice, her taste, her eyes… When Rio finally went limp against the mattress, her chest heaving with every breath, she could still hear Agatha in her head telling her what a good girl she was.</p><p>God, she was in so much fucking trouble.</p><p>Something cold and wet hit her face again, followed by a second and a third drop. Rio sputtered, turning off her vibrator and tossing it aside before sitting up and flicking on the light on her nightstand. She looked up at the ceiling to see water dripping from the crack, a large brown stain forming around it.</p><p>“Fuck me,” she muttered, pulling her phone out from under her pillow. It was a little past two in the morning, and it was Christmas Eve. As she dialed the super’s number, the dripping turned into a steady stream.</p><p>“Yello?”</p><p>“Mr. Shostakov? This is Rio Vidal in apartment six-B,” she said. “I’m sorry to wake you but there’s a leak in my apartment.”</p><p>“Ah, Miss Rio, I’ve told you, call me Alexei,” the man said. “I can come check it first thing in the morning, alright?”</p><p>“No, I mean, I don’t think it can wait that long,” Rio replied, grabbing her wastebasket and setting it on her mattress to try and catch the water that was now streaming from her roof.</p><p>“Miss Rio, is just a little leak,” he said drowsily.</p><p>Before Rio could argue further, the ceiling gave a loud groan. Rio screamed as the plaster gave way and a pile of wet drywall, wood, and insulation fell. Every surface in her room was covered in dust and rubble and the pipes, now fully exposed, continued to spray water everywhere.</p><p>“Miss Rio? Miss Rio, I’m coming right up!” the super said on the other side of the phone.</p><p>True to his word, Alexei was there just a few minutes later, his bathrobe tied over his pajamas and a stained tank top. He was quickly followed by two other workers, and they spent the next hour working to stop the steady stream of water coming from the pipes in Rio’s ceiling. Rio spent that hour in the living room on her phone. She had called Alice, who had called their insurance company. Then she had called every hotel in the city that she could afford, but with it being the holidays, everything was full.</p><p>“No, I understand, thank you anyway,” Rio said, disconnecting the line for what had to be the twentieth time as Alexei emerged from her room.</p><p>“We got the leak fixed, Miss Rio, but I’m afraid it will be a while before everything can be fixed, what with the holidays and all,” he told her. “Do you have somewhere you can stay?”</p><p>“All the hotels are booked up,” Rio told him. “Could I stay in Alice’s room?”</p><p>He shook his head. “There are chemicals in the insulation, and with the wet there will be mold. It won’t be safe to stay here for quite a while, I’m afraid.”</p><p>Rio nodded and looked back at her phone as Alexei turned back toward her bedroom. There was one person she could call who had an empty guest room and an unrelenting desire to take care of others. The only issue was that she had gotten off to thoughts about that same person an hour earlier. But desperate times called for desperate measures.</p><p>Rio dialed Agatha’s number and put her phone to her ear.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha answered, her voice groggy with sleep. “It’s nearly three in the morning, what—?”</p><p>“I’m sorry to wake you,” Rio said quickly, before Agatha’s sleepy voice could become even more endearing. “I have a bit of a problem.”</p><p>“Agatha? Who is it? Is everything alright?”</p><p>Rio’s chest clenched at the woman’s muffled voice on the other end of the line. Agatha was with someone. Agatha was <em> sleeping </em>with someone. Which meant she had probably fucked that someone.</p><p>“Yeah, just give me a minute,” Agatha groaned sleepily. “Rio, what’s happening?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was raspy in that post-sex way. Yeah, she had definitely fucked another woman. It shouldn’t upset Rio— it shouldn’t. They weren’t together, they both had set that boundary. Agatha was free to date other people, was free to fuck other people. Meanwhile, Rio was having sex dreams about Agatha fucking her on stage…</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“It’s fine, everything’s fine,” Rio said quickly. “I’m sorry I interrupted your… <em> whatever. </em>I’m just gonna—”</p><p>“Rio, take a breath and tell me what the fuck has you calling me at three o’clock in the morning,” Agatha ordered.</p><p>Rio gulped. “There was a leak in my bedroom and the ceiling kind of collapsed and now I have nowhere to stay.”</p><p>There was a pause, and then a muttered curse. “Jesus fucking Christ, why didn’t you lead with that?”</p><p>“I was getting there,” Rio groused, sitting on the end of her sofa with a huff.</p><p>“I’ll be there in twenty,” Agatha told her. “Where’s my fucking bra?”</p><p>Rio could feel her cheeks flush. “You don’t have to…”</p><p>“I said I’ll be there in twenty,” Agatha repeated, and then the call disconnected.</p><p>Rio looked down at the phone in her hand. Agatha was fucking another woman. Rio’s ceiling had fallen in. This was fine. Everything was totally fucking fine.</p><p>She was still frozen on her sofa when Agatha arrived twenty minutes later, breezing through the open door like she owned the place. Unlike Rio, who was still in a tank top with no bra and the boxers she slept in, Agatha looked mostly put together, in a dark purple sweater dress and leather boots. But her makeup was smudged and her hair was messier than Rio had ever seen it, even after they had—</p><p>
<em> Nope, not going there. </em>
</p><p>“Rio? Rio! Are you alright?” Agatha asked, hurrying to her. She cupped Rio’s face like a child’s, looking her over. “There’s dust in your hair.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio said, pushing Agatha’s hands away. She didn’t know where those hands had been, who or what they had touched before Agatha came over. “The ceiling caved in while I was in the room.”</p><p>“You’re lucky you weren’t in bed asleep,” Agatha huffed. “<em> They’re </em>lucky you weren’t hurt. I’d help you sue the owners of this building to kingdom come if you were injured.”</p><p>“I’m okay,” Rio assured her. “I just need a place to stay, that’s all.”</p><p>“Well, you can stay with us for as long as you need,” Agatha told her. “Can we get to your room?”</p><p>“Alexei and his guys are cleaning up some of the mess,” Rio explained. “Alexei’s my super.”</p><p>As if on cue, the barrel-chested Russian man stepped out of her bedroom carrying a trashcan full of debris. His bathrobe was soaked and covered in a fine layer of dust. The other two workers shuffled past him and out the door, looking just as disheveled.</p><p>“Did you find a place to stay, Miss Rio?” he asked.</p><p>“She’s staying with me,” Agatha said, her tone leaving no room for argument.</p><p>“Ah, good,” Alexei nodded. “You and your… lady friend can go in there now, but be very careful. Get everything you can, but if you need to come back another day to get your things, we can arrange that. Do you need help getting your things?”</p><p>“That would be great, actually,” Rio replied. “But I know it’s late…”</p><p>“It is no trouble,” he assured her. “I’ll be back to help as soon as I check on the folks in seven-B, alright?”</p><p>Rio nodded and stepped past Alexei and into her room. Her bed and most of the floor was still covered in rubble. Everything was wet. Alexei’s toolbag was on her desk, with several wrenches and pipe fittings strewn across the surface.</p><p>“I messaged Clint to come help as well,” Agatha said from behind her. “Now where would you like to start?”</p><p>Rio looked around at the destruction. “I don’t even know.”</p><p>Agatha looked around as well, her eyes settling on something in the corner. Her lips tugged up in a grin as she crossed the room, wiggling past Rio, and bent over to pick up whatever she had seen.</p><p>“Do you need to pack this?” she asked, holding the base of Rio’s vibrator between her thumb and forefinger. Somehow, in spite of everything else in the room being absolutely drenched, the other end of the device, the end that actually came in contact with Rio’s body, was coated in the dried remains of her earlier orgasm.</p><p>Rio’s face turned molten red and she yanked the device out of Agatha’s hand as fast as she could. “That was… I…”</p><p>“Hey, no judgment here,” Agatha said, holding her hands up in defense. “Seems like I wasn’t the only one whose night got interrupted.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks heated further as she threw the vibrator back into her nightstand drawer.</p><p>“You’re not gonna clean it?” Agatha asked. “That’s not good for the silicone.”</p><p>“Oh my god, you are <em> not </em>lecturing me on how to take care of my sex toys right now!” Rio exclaimed.</p><p>“I’m just saying, if you’re going to spend good money on something, you should take care of it,” Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“Fine,” Rio hissed, retrieving the device from the drawer again. “I’ll be in the bathroom.”</p><p>“Pack your toiletries while you’re in there,” Agatha instructed.</p><p>Rio washed the toy in the bathroom sink, muttering curses under her breath the entire time. She collected all of her toiletries and tossed them into a leftover grocery bag. By the time she finished, Alexei and Clint were both in her living room, and Agatha was instructing them on how to carry Rio’s instruments.</p><p>“Be careful with those,” Agatha barked. “If there’s even a scratch on them, I’ll—”</p><p>“You’ll have our jobs, yes ma’am,” Clint huffed under the weight of Rio’s double bass, clearly familiar with Agatha’s threats.</p><p>They disappeared through the door, and Agatha turned to Rio. “You need clothes.”</p><p>Rio looked down at herself. “Well, yeah, I didn’t have time to change.”</p><p>“No, you need to <em> pack </em>some clothes,” Agatha corrected, rolling her eyes. “Do you have a suitcase?”</p><p>“Of course I have a suitcase,” Rio muttered under her breath, squeezing past Agatha to retrieve her duffel bag from her closet. Unfortunately, the doors of her closet had been wide open and everything inside was soaked and covered in dust. “Great… Guess I’ll borrow Alice’s.”</p><p>Alice had taken her largest suitcase with her to California, but that left two smaller ones that Rio knew Alice wouldn’t mind her borrowing, given the circumstances. She retrieved them and returned to her room, where she found Agatha digging through her underwear drawer.</p><p>“Hey!” Rio exclaimed as Agatha held up a black thong.</p><p>“What? You’re gonna need them,” Agatha argued.</p><p>“I can pack my own underwear, thank you very much,” Rio told her, snatching the scrap of lace from her hand. “Why don’t you check out the closet?”</p><p>“Already did, and it’s a mess,” Agatha informed her. “I think it’ll be better if we come back and get those clothes in a few days, once they’ve dried out, and then we can figure out what can be laundered and saved.”</p><p>Rio groaned. “Great. Well, at least that makes packing easier.”</p><p>Since she was limited to clothes in her dresser, packing was quick and easy. She grabbed a week’s worth of underwear, her favorite bras, and some loungewear and called it quits. She put on a pair of leggings and a sweatshirt over her sleepwear and put on a pair of soggy sneakers that would at least get her to Agatha’s place. Meanwhile Agatha directed Clint and Alexei to the pile of Christmas gifts to the car.</p><p>It was almost five in the morning when Rio waved goodbye to Alexei and they started the drive to Agatha’s place.</p><p>“I’m sorry I called you guys so late,” she said, slumping in the leather seat.</p><p>“It’s all good,” Clint assured her. “We were already out, anyway.”</p><p>His words reminded Rio of something. She cracked her eyes open to look at Agatha, who was staring out the window at the passing city streets. “Oh yeah. Hot date?”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flushed. “I wouldn’t call it hot.”</p><p>“But it was a date, then?” Rio asked, and the woman nodded. Rio’s head dropped back against the headrest. “Sorry I interrupted.” And she should drop it, she should let it go, she should— “Who is she?”</p><p>Agatha’s brow rose. “Why?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Just curious.”</p><p>“Mmhmm,” Agatha hummed skeptically. “Her name is Madelyn.”</p><p>“How’d you meet?”</p><p>“Jen introduced us.”</p><p>“What does she do?”</p><p>“She’s head of social media marketing for a publishing company,” Agatha replied. “Is there a reason I’m being interrogated?”</p><p>“Just making conversation,” Rio replied. “Did you have a good time?”</p><p>“It was nice,” Agatha told her. “We went out for dinner, had a few drinks, went back to her place…”</p><p><em> Did you fuck? </em> The question was on the tip of Rio’s tongue, but she managed to bite it back. She already knew the answer, anyway. <em> Was she any good? </em></p><p>
<em> Was she as good as me? </em>
</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“What?” she spat back, not opening her eyes. The word came out sharper than she intended. She heard a soft whirring sound and cracked open her eyes to see that Agatha had rolled up the partition between them and Clint. “What?”</p><p>“Do you have a problem with me dating someone else?”</p><p>“No.” <em> Yes. </em>“Why would I?”</p><p>“I don’t know, why would you?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I don’t,” Rio replied, shifting uncomfortably in her seat.</p><p>“You sure seem like you do.”</p><p>“Well I don’t, so drop it.”</p><p>“Not until you tell me why me going out with someone else makes you angry,” Agatha argued, her voice sing-songy and irritating.</p><p>“It doesn’t.” Rio needed to cover. “I just wanted to know some details about this person you’re bringing into Nicky’s life, that’s all.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “That’s none of your concern.”</p><p>“He’s my son, so it is my concern,” Rio argued.</p><p>“He’s not—” Agatha bit her tongue, her gaze shifting back out the window.</p><p>“No, say what you were going to say,” Rio goaded.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, her voice low and even.</p><p>“You were going to say he’s not my son,” Rio continued.</p><p>“I didn’t mean it,” Agatha argued.</p><p>“That can’t be your go-to argument forever,” Rio said, looking down at the leather armrest as if the answers to all of life’s questions were written in the grain.</p><p>“It was a first date,” Agatha told her. “I don’t even know yet if it will ever be serious enough for her to meet Nicky.”</p><p>“Seemed pretty serious,” Rio muttered.</p><p>“What do you mean by that?” Agatha demanded.</p><p>Rio huffed and put her head back. “I’m too tired for this.”</p><p>“Too tired for what? Having a mature conversation?”</p><p>“You call this a mature conversation?” she asked. </p><p>“You’re jealous,” Agatha said finally.</p><p>“No, I’m not,” Rio argued. She needed to change the subject before she said something she would regret. “What’s Nicky up to tonight?”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a long moment, and Rio knew she was trying to decide if she wanted to follow Rio’s lead to change the subject or dig further. Finally, she answered. “He’s spending the night with Wanda and the twins.”</p><p>“That’s nice.” Rio yawned.</p><p>“He’ll be thrilled when he finds out you’re staying with us,” Agatha continued.</p><p>“I guess that is one bright side to come out of all this,” Rio agreed. She yawned again, her eyes drifting closed.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Hmm?” she said, peeling her eyes open, but just barely.</p><p>“Rest,” Agatha ordered. “I’ll wake you up when we get to my place.”</p><p>“So bossy,” Rio hummed, but she closed her eyes anyway.</p><p>“You know you love it.”</p><p>Rio frowned. That was the problem: she really did.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio Vidal hated Christmas. Call her Scrooge, but it was true. She was a musician, and while Christmas gigs meant good money, they also meant an insane amount of work in a very short amount of time. By the time Rio’s ceiling crashed down on her, she was already sleep deprived after playing five gigs in only three days. On top of sleep deprivation, holiday gigs also meant losing time that could be spent with loved ones. This wasn’t usually an issue for Rio, because her closest family was dead and most of her friends were also musicians, so they understood this fact of life and worked around it.</p><p>But this year, it was a problem. And this year, Rio found herself hating Christmas more than ever.</p><p>She stood in Agatha’s kitchen at 10am on Christmas Eve, dark circles under her eyes, as she waited on Agatha’s ridiculously expensive and overly-complicated coffee maker to spit out her cup of coffee. She was dressed in her concert attire, ready for a full day of performances. She had committed months ago, before Nicky even came into her life, to play four services at St. Luke’s Episcopal Church, the first at two and the last a Midnight Mass that began at ten. Now that the day had arrived, however, Rio wanted nothing more than to get back into her pajamas and sleep for a few more hours before curling up with Nicky on the sofa. But backing out now, even with her newfound family and severe lack of sleep, would be extremely unprofessional. And considering most of her belongings had been destroyed by water less than twelve hours earlier, she really needed the paycheck.</p><p>Just as the coffee maker began to spit out a dark brew, the door of the apartment opened and a few seconds later Nicky’s small body crashed into her from behind.</p><p>“Rio!” he exclaimed, hugging her tightly.</p><p>“Hey, mijo,” she said drowsily, turning to hug him with one arm before ruffling his hair. “Did you have a good time with Billy and Tommy?”</p><p>“Mmhmm,” he nodded, his head bopping against her ribs. “Mama said your apartment flooded?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t say flooded,” Rio replied. “But there was a leaky pipe and the ceiling kind of… collapsed.”</p><p>“Oh,” he said, his brow wrinkling as he tried to imagine it. “So you’re gonna live with us now?”</p><p>“I’m staying with you until my apartment gets fixed, or I find somewhere else to live,” Rio corrected.</p><p>“I think you should stay forever,” Nicky said, releasing his hold on her waist and heading over to the refrigerator.</p><p>Agatha followed Nicky into the kitchen, her arms laden down with grocery bags. “Oh, good, you’re up.”</p><p>“What’s all this?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Flour, eggs, herbs… I’m baking bread to take to Lilia’s tomorrow,” Agatha told her.</p><p>“You know, I never would’ve pegged you as a baker,” Rio said, sipping her coffee and leaning back against the counter.</p><p>“Why not?” Agatha asked, looking slightly offended.</p><p>“I just wouldn’t think you had the patience for it,” Rio shrugged.</p><p>“I can be patient!” Agatha argued, her voice rising in pitch. “Sometimes good things are worth waiting for.”</p><p>Rio hummed over the rim of her coffee cup in agreement.</p><p>“Are you going somewhere?” Agatha asked, seeming to finally notice Rio’s outfit. It was the same black ensemble she had worn the night they first met, because Rio had one good all-black outfit for performances and thankfully it hadn’t been damaged when the roof collapsed.</p><p>“I have a gig today,” Rio told her. “Multiple gigs, actually. I’m playing four mass services at St. Luke’s Episcopal. I won’t get back until after midnight.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “That’s too bad. I think Nicky was planning a movie day.”</p><p>Nicky perked up at that, looking away from the fridge. “Yeah, we can watch Elf and Home Alone and A Christmas Story and…”</p><p>“Sorry, mijo, I’ve gotta take a raincheck,” Rio told him.</p><p>“But… It’s not raining?” Nicky asked, brow wrinkled in confusion.</p><p>“She means you’ll have to watch Christmas movies another time, sweetheart,” Agatha said. “Rio has to work.”</p><p>Nicky’s expression quickly morphed from confusion to dismay. “What do you mean, you have to work?”</p><p>“I have gigs, Nicky,” Rio explained. “I have to go play cello for some church services.”</p><p>“But… But it’s Christmas!” Nicky exclaimed, his voice climbing to a pitch that made Rio feel like someone had stuck forks in her ears.</p><p>“Technically it’s Christmas Eve,” she pointed out, and Agatha glared at her as if to say that’s not helpful. But what the hell was she supposed to say?</p><p>“I thought we were gonna spend Christmas together!” he shouted, looking between her and Agatha. Tears started to well up in his eyes, and Rio felt panic rising in her chest.</p><p>“No, no, Nicky, don’t cry. We will spend Christmas together,” Rio assured him, “tomorrow. We just can’t spend Christmas Eve together because I have to work.”</p><p>“Why do you have to work on Christmas Eve?” Nicky demanded. “Why can’t you take the day off?”</p><p>“It doesn’t work like that, mijo,” Rio sighed. “Look, we can watch the movies tomorrow before we go to Lilia’s. Right, Agatha?”</p><p>“Yes, definitely,” Agatha agreed.</p><p>“No, because tomorrow we’re opening presents and we’ll play Switch together!” Nicky declared and the tears started falling. “We’re watching movies today. We always watch movies on Christmas Eve.”</p><p>“You and your mama can still watch Christmas movies today,” Rio told him.</p><p>Nicky looked between her and Agatha and frowned. “Mama took a vacation for Christmas. Why didn’t you take a vacation?”</p><p>“Again, that’s just not how it works, bud,” Rio argued. Her head was starting to pound, and it felt like her eyes were going to pop out of her skull. She looked at the time on her phone. “Listen, I have to go—”</p><p>“No, you can’t go!” Nicky shouted.</p><p>“Nicky, don’t raise your voice,” Agatha warned.</p><p>“Christmas is supposed to be for family!” Nicky shouted, ignoring her. His face was turning red as his emotions rose. “Real moms spend Christmas with their kids!”</p><p>Something snapped in Rio. “Well, I’m not your mom! I’m just your birth mother. You have a mama, and she’s here to spend time with you. But I’m not your mom, and I have to go to work. That’s just how it is.”</p><p>The moment Rio stopped speaking to breathe, she realized she had gone too far. Nicky looked at her with wide, tear-filled eyes, but the tears weren’t from anger that his plans had been disturbed, they were from pain, pain that she had inflicted. Rio looked to Agatha, hoping the other woman would help her out, but the look of disgust and fury on Agatha’s face told her she had gone too far.</p><p>“Mijo—” she began.</p><p>“Don’t call me that!” Nicky exclaimed. “I hate you! Go play your stupid gig! I don’t want you here anyway!”</p><p>He shoved past her and ran out of the kitchen, up the stairs, and slammed the door to his bedroom. Rio stood rooted to the spot, her heart in her throat. The smell of her coffee made her want to puke, so she set the mug on the counter. She turned to Agatha again.</p><p>“I didn’t mean—”</p><p>“You should go,” Agatha said, her voice low, tone deadly serious.</p><p>“Agatha, you know I—”</p><p>“Seriously, you need to go,” Agatha repeated, the pitch of her voice rising in a dangerous cadence.</p><p>Rio nodded. She turned and grabbed her cello from where it rested by the door and turned the knob.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she choked out, the tears welling up unbidden. “I’m really sorry. Can you—”</p><p>“Just go, Rio.”</p><p>She nodded and hurried from the apartment.</p><p> </p><p>It was half past midnight when Rio returned to Agatha’s apartment. She pulled her cello from the trunk of the cab and stood in the cold air, tiny cold snowflakes hitting her cheeks. It was the kind of snow that was too fine to stick, but was so cold that it burned the skin when it hit. Above her, most of the lights in the building were dark, but a few cast golden light down to the streets below. Rio couldn’t pinpoint which windows belonged to Agatha’s apartment, but she hoped it was one of the light ones. She couldn’t imagine holding onto her apologies through the night.</p><p>She felt like shit. She had played like shit, too, and she knew it. Muscle memory could only do so much to combat exhaustion and emotional turmoil. She couldn’t get the image of Nicky’s tearfilled eyes out of her mind.</p><p>God, she had fucked up. She had fucked up so bad. She hadn’t meant what she said. Or, well, she had, kind of. She was stating fact, in a way. She wasn’t Nicky’s mom. She had given up that right. Agatha was his mother. It wasn’t a fact she was uncomfortable with, it simply was. She had given him up for a reason, perhaps this very one. She hadn’t been fit to be a mother a decade before, and maybe she wasn’t fit to be one now. Not that she was even trying to be his mother now. She wasn’t sure what they were, what they were trying to be.</p><p>What she was sure of, what she knew beyond a shadow of a doubt, was that she loved him. That had never been a question, not ten years before, and not now. The last thing she wanted to do was hurt him, and yet she had.</p><p>Rio stepped out of the elevator and made her way to Agatha’s door. She hoped someone was awake— she didn’t have a key. Then again, she wouldn’t blame Agatha if she didn’t let her back in, if she told Rio to get lost and to never speak to her or Nicky again. She could see Agatha’s face in her mind’s eye just as clearly as she could see Nicky’s— if looks could kill, Rio would’ve dropped dead in Agatha’s kitchen that morning.</p><p>She raised her fist to knock on the door, but it opened before she could. Agatha stood in the doorway, her finger pressed to her lips to signal Rio to be quiet. She gestured for Rio to enter and quietly closed and locked the door behind her as Rio put her cello down.</p><p>“Nicky wanted to stay awake until you got home,” Agatha told her, crossing her arms over her chest. “But I sent him to bed a little while ago.”</p><p>“He’s too sweet,” Rio sighed. “Agatha—”</p><p>“Nope, you listen and don’t speak for now,” Agatha cut her off sharply. Agatha’s voice was hushed, so as to not disturb the sleeping boy upstairs, but that made it no less severe. Rio obediently closed her mouth. “I know that you were upset this morning. I know that you hadn’t slept, and that you were in a hurry. And I know better than anyone that when Nicky gets worked up like that, it can be a lot to handle.”</p><p>“I still shouldn’t have—”</p><p>“Ah ah ah! You’re not talking, you’re listening,” Agatha cut her off, waving her hand in Rio’s face. “No, you shouldn’t have said what you said, at least not the way you said it. You and I both know that the relationship you’re building with Nicky is complicated, to say the least. It’s not the same as being his mother. But he’s too young to understand all that. When you said you’re not his mom, what he heard was that you don’t love him.”</p><p>“I—” Rio cut herself off before Agatha could, pursing her lips in frustration.</p><p>“I know that’s not what you meant,” Agatha said for her. “I know it, you know it. And I tried to explain that to him today.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and leaned against the back of the sofa. She was silent for a long moment, and Rio took that as permission to speak.</p><p>“Thank you,” she said hesitantly, waiting for Agatha to cut her off. When she wasn’t interrupted, she continued. “I was afraid you didn’t understand, that you would still be angry at me.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m still angry,” Agatha corrected her. “And it took me a few hours to cool down this morning before I could be rational enough to talk to him. I ruined two batches of sourdough.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders slumped. “Oh. I’m sorry.”</p><p>“I may not have given birth to him, but he’s my son,” Agatha said, her tone barely above a growl. “And you may have given birth to him, but I swear to all that is good, if you ever hurt him like you did this morning, Rio, I will cut off all communication. Full stop. I don’t care if it’s said in frustration or exhaustion or whatever. You broke his heart in a way that—” Agatha’s voice broke. “You don’t know how deeply he cares for you. How deeply it hurt him to think you didn’t love him the way he loves you.”</p><p>“I think I have an idea,” Rio murmured. “I haven’t been able to get his face out of my mind all day. I hate myself for how badly I hurt him, Agatha. It was never my intention, you know that.”</p><p>“It wasn’t your intention, but you still did it.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said as her heart took up residence somewhere in her throat once more. “Do you think he can forgive me?”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a moment before sighing. “Nicky has the purest, softest heart of anyone I’ve ever met. He’s probably already forgiven you, if we’re being honest. But that doesn’t mean you don’t owe him an apology, or that everything is instantly alright.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio nodded. She glanced toward the stairs. “Do you think he’s still awake?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha said with a shrug. “You can go check.”</p><p>Rio took a step toward the stairs before an idea hit her. Instead she went to the Christmas tree and pulled a gift from the pile to take with her.</p><p>“Bribery?” Agatha asked, the corner of her lips quirking with the hint of a smirk.</p><p>“Something like that,” Rio said hopefully.</p><p>Rio made her way up the stairs, down the hall, to Nicky’s bedroom door. The door was cracked, but no light shone from inside. She knocked softly.</p><p>“Nicky? You still awake?” she called, her voice little more than a whisper.</p><p>For a moment she didn’t think he would respond. Then, finally, came the sleepy reply. “Rio?”</p><p>Her heart gave a lurch at how sweet and drowsy his voice sounded. “We can talk in the morning, if you want. I just wanted to make sure you’re okay.”</p><p>There was a long pause, and Rio thought maybe he had fallen asleep. Then his bedside lamp flickered to life, bathing the bedroom in soft light.</p><p>“You can come in,” Nicky said, sitting up against his pillows.</p><p>Rio pushed the door open and stepped inside. The floor of the bedroom was markedly cleaner than it normally was: all of the dirty laundry was in the basket, Nicky’s toys were put away, his books were stacked neatly on the bookshelf.</p><p>“Mama made me clean because I shouted at you,” Nicky told her, realizing what she was looking at. “I shouldn’t have done that.”</p><p>“You were upset,” Rio said, sitting on the edge of his bed. “We do and say a lot of things we shouldn’t when we’re upset.”</p><p>“That’s what Mama said,” he sighed.</p><p>“Your mama’s a smart woman.” Rio’s fingers traced the stitching in his quilt. Many times that day she had thought of how she would apologize, but now that she was here, the words seemed stuck in her throat. “Nicky…”</p><p>“What’s that?” he asked, pointing to the wrapped gift in her hands.</p><p>Rio bit her tongue before handing him the gift. “I thought you might want to open one of your presents early.”</p><p>He looked at her for a moment before eagerly ripping through the snowflake-patterned wrapping paper to reveal the dark green leather-bound album inside. His eyes widened as he ran his fingers over his name embossed in gold on the front cover. Rio moved to sit beside him on the bed, leaning back against the pillows and headboard.</p><p>“Open it,” Rio said, her voice barely a whisper as she held her breath in anticipation.</p><p>Nicky opened the album, and his eyes widened as he saw the black and white photos on the first page.</p><p>“These are my grandparents, your great-grandparents,” Rio said, pointing to the photos. “This is Hector and Rosario Vidal, they were my dad’s parents. And this is James and Mary Walsh, my mom’s parents.”</p><p>“Rosario?” Nicky said, looking from the photo to Rio.</p><p>“I was named after her,” Rio nodded. “Everyone called her Rosa, so they called me Rio.”</p><p>Rio had contacted relatives she hadn’t spoken to in years in search of the pictures, but as Nicky studied them, all of the work felt worthwhile. Beneath each one, Rio had written notes about what she knew about each of her grandparents: when they were born, their parents’ names, where they were from.</p><p>Nicky turned the page. The next pages had photos of Rio’s parents, all at different ages, and a large photo from their wedding.</p><p>“This is my mom and dad, your grandparents, Mateo and Christina Vidal,” Rio said. “My dad moved to Florida when he was eighteen and worked his way through college. He fell off a ladder one day and hit his head, had to go to the hospital for stitches, and that’s where he met my mom. She was a nurse. He said it was love at first sight, and she said that was the head injury talking.”</p><p>Nicky studied the pictures for a long minute before looking up at Rio and Agatha. “Do you think I look like them?”</p><p>Rio had seen her parents in him the moment he was born, and again the day he showed up at her office. She had known him, without needing any kind of DNA testing, because his features were so familiar: her dad’s chin and eyes and lopsided smile, her mom’s brows and nose and cheeks. They might be gone, but she was still here, and he was here, carrying on their legacy.</p><p>“You do,” she said finally, her eyes watering. “You really do.”</p><p>Nicky turned the page, and let out a gasp. “Rio, is this you?”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Yep, that’s me.”</p><p>He was pointing to a picture of her as a baby, staring up at the camera with big eyes and red cheeks. The next few pages held pictures of her growing up, some with her parents and other family members, some with classmates and teammates. Nicky laughed at the photo of her dad carrying a four-year-old Rio upside down, and again at her terrible bangs in third grade. There were photos of her first violin recital, newspaper clippings of her playing basketball. Then he came to the last page.</p><p>“Is that me?” he asked, squinting down at the infant in the picture. It was the same picture Rio had dug out the day they met, the one of her in the hospital the day he was born.</p><p>“Yep, that’s you,” Rio replied. “This was the day you were born.”</p><p>“And this one,” he said, pointing to the other photo. “Was I in your belly in this one?”</p><p>“Yeah, you were using my bladder as a soccer ball,” Rio told him.</p><p>“That’s so cool,” Nicky said, peering down at the pictures. He looked at the opposite page and frowned at the empty paper, then turned the page to see more blank pages. “What about the rest?”</p><p>“Well, that’s for you,” Rio replied. “This part of the book is some of your history, but this is just part of it. I wanted to leave room for some stuff about your mama, and plenty of room for pictures of your life. Who knows, maybe one day you’ll show this to your kids so they know where they come from.”</p><p>Nicky looked up at her. “Thank you, Rio. I really love it.”</p><p>“You’re welcome, mijo,” she said, pulling him into a tight hug. “I love you.”</p><p>“I love you, too,” he murmured into her shoulder. “Rio?”</p><p>“Mmhmm?” she hummed, not letting him go.</p><p>“I didn’t mean it when I said that I hate you,” he said, his voice soft.</p><p>“I know, Nicky,” she assured him, letting him go so she could look into his eyes. “And I’m so sorry that I said what I said, and that I hurt your feelings. I didn’t mean… Well, I didn’t mean it the way it came out.”</p><p>“What did you mean?” he asked.</p><p>Rio sighed and sat back against the headboard again. “Nicky, I need you to understand that when I gave you up for adoption, I gave up the right to be your mom. Legally, I’m not your parent. Agatha is your mama.”</p><p>His brows wrinkled in thought. “But… You’re still…”</p><p>“I still love you very much,” Rio assured him. “So much that it hurts, sometimes. But, well… Honestly, I’m not sure how exactly this relationship works. I’m still learning. Today I messed up, and I might mess up again. But it doesn’t change how much I love you, okay? Please never doubt that.”</p><p>“Okay,” Nicky agreed with a yawn.</p><p>Rio reached over and closed the album in Nicky’s hands. “Sounds like you need to go to sleep so Santa can come.”</p><p>Nicky squirmed, his expression turning guilty. “Rio, can I tell you something?”</p><p>“Yeah, mijo, you can tell me anything,” she assured him.</p><p>He looked toward the door before cupping his hands over his mouth and whispering, “I know Santa isn’t real.”</p><p>Rio gasped dramatically. “What?”</p><p>“Shh!” he shushed her, looking toward the door.</p><p>Rio followed his gaze, then raised a brow at him. “You don’t want your mama to know?”</p><p>“If she thinks I don’t believe in Santa, I won’t get as many presents,” he whispered.</p><p>“You little sneak,” Rio huffed. “Who told you? And when?”</p><p>“Tommy told me last Christmas,” he replied. “Please don’t tell Mama that I know.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t believe her ears. “Nicky, you shouldn’t lie to your mama.”</p><p>Nicky’s face suddenly morphed into an expression that was so similar to Agatha’s that Rio could almost forget they weren’t biologically related. “Rio, Mama’s been lying to me about Santa Claus for my whole life. I’m milking it for as long as I can.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped. Then laughter bubbled up in her throat, spilling out before she could stop it. She grabbed Nicky and tickled his sides until he joined her, flailing wildly in her grasp. Finally, when they were both out of breath, Rio squeezed him into a tight hug and kissed his cheek.</p><p>“You’re a sneaky little shit, you know that?” she chuckled. “And I love you so damn much.”</p><p>“That’s two dollars for the swear jar,” Nicky huffed.</p><p>Rio just laughed and kissed him again. Then she stood and tucked him in. She picked up the ripped wrapping paper and set the scrapbook on his nightstand.</p><p>“Goodnight, mijo,” she said, turning off the light.</p><p>“Goodnight, Rio,” he murmured, snuggling into his pillow.</p><p>Rio smiled and stepped out. She made her way back downstairs to see Agatha silently positioning more gifts beneath the tree. She leaned on the banister and debated telling the other woman that the jig was up, but something stopped her. Maybe it was the secretive grin on Agatha’s lips as she carefully filled Nicky’s stocking, or maybe it was the idea of having a secret with her boy, one that didn’t hurt anyone.</p><p>When she was finished, Agatha finally looked up and saw her. “Are you two okay?”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath and sighed. “Yeah, we’re okay.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha nodded.</p><p>Rio bit her lip. “Are we good?”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, the smile slipping from her face for a moment before it was replaced with a more pensive but peaceful expression. “Yeah. Yeah, we’re good.”</p><p>Rio smiled, looking back at the gifts beneath the tree. “Merry Christmas, Agatha.”</p><p>“Merry Christmas, Rio.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The guest bed in Agatha’s apartment had the most comfortable mattress Rio had ever slept on. She wasn’t sure what thread count the sheets were, but they were sleek and soft and the perfect temperature. And the pillows— if Rio hadn’t known Agatha was in a different tax bracket already, the sheer number of pillows on the bed would’ve tipped her off. Other than the need to pee, Rio had no desire to get out of the bed, so she snuggled further into the nest of pillows.</p><p>But the scent of cinnamon and coffee wafting through the door from downstairs was definitely making a case for getting up.</p><p>With one last stretch, Rio made her way to the bathroom and freshened up. Once her bladder was empty, her teeth were brushed, and her hair was some semblance of order, she made her way downstairs.</p><p>“Riooooo!” Nicky exclaimed as soon as he saw her from where he was perched on one of the barstools in the kitchen. He jumped down and ran at her, hugging her with so much force that it drove a soft oof from her lips. “It’s Christmas!”</p><p>“It sure is,” Rio grinned, her voice gravelly with sleep. He pulled her into the kitchen where Agatha was standing over the stove, her hair messy with sleep, wearing a floral robe beneath her apron, with a spatula in one hand and a coffee mug in the other.</p><p>“There’s coffee,” Agatha said in lieu of greeting, her own voice sounding just as sleepy as Rio’s.</p><p>“Oh my god, I love you,” Rio sighed, only to realize exactly what she had said a moment later. She froze, mug in one hand, coffee pot in the other, staring at the subway tile backsplash and praying to whatever deity heard her that Agatha didn’t catch what she said. Maybe if she changed the subject really quickly… “What’s for breakfast?”</p><p>“French toast and bacon!” Nicky said happily. Rio chuckled as she opened the fridge for some coffee creamer.</p><p>Suddenly Agatha was beside Rio, so close that her silk robe brushed Rio’s legs. Rio’s breath caught in her throat.</p><p>“Do not tell him French toast has eggs in it,” Agatha whispered, reaching past Rio for a pack of bacon.</p><p>“Yes, ma’am,” Rio nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha grinned, stepping away.</p><p>Rio stood frozen, blinking at the contents of the refrigerator, feeling like her brain was stuck in loading mode with that little circle spinning behind her eyeballs. Two words and body heat, that’s all it took to knock all of her systems offline. Ridiculous, really.</p><p>“Rio? Can you get me some juice?” Nicky asked.</p><p>“Yep,” Rio said quickly, trying her best to shake off whatever had just happened. “Yep, I can do that.”</p><p>She turned to pass Nicky the bottle of juice and poured creamer in her coffee. She looked at Agatha, who was once again focused on the stove in front of her, as if she hadn’t just turned Rio into a pile of mush.</p><p>“Mama says we can’t open presents until after breakfast,” Nicky said, pulling her focus back to the conversation at hand.</p><p>Rio put the juice and creamer back into the fridge before sitting on the barstool beside him. “Smart Mama. You need fuel before you get distracted with your presents.”</p><p>“See, Rio gets it,” Agatha said as the bacon sizzled.</p><p>“Billy and Tommy got new Switch games from their dad,” Nicky said. “They get an early Christmas with their dad, so they already opened some of their presents.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, sipping her coffee. “What do you think of that?”</p><p>Nicky looked up at her with a wrinkled brow. “Is that how it’s gonna be with you and Mama?”</p><p>Rio almost choked on her coffee. On the other side of the room, Agatha turned away from the stove to face them. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Well, Billy and Tommy’s parents aren’t married so they have separate Christmases,” Nicky continued. “ You and Mama aren’t married. So am I gonna have to have two Christmases? One with Mama and one with you?”</p><p>“No, sweetheart, of course not,” Rio assured him. “Billy and Tommy’s parents are divorced, that’s why they have separate Christmases. I imagine Wanda and her ex might not get along very well, since they’re divorced.”</p><p>“That’s an understatement,” Agatha mumbled.</p><p>“Billy says they argued a lot,” Nicky agreed. “Then they decided not to be married anymore.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Rio nodded. “Your mama and I get along just fine. Plus, we’re not getting married. We’re… friends. So we can spend Christmas all together every year, if that’s what you want. Right, Agatha?”</p><p>“Of course, yeah,” Agatha agreed, plastering a toothless smile on her face that didn’t quite reach her eyes.</p><p>“Good.” Nicky sighed and the tension in his body immediately released. It was clear he had been worried about this for a while.</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha again, but she had already turned back to the stove. Rio sighed into her coffee. It was another reminder: don’t mess this up.</p><p>After breakfast, which was of course delicious, Agatha refilled their coffees and they followed a now sugar-hyped Nicky into the living room. Sat on one end of the sofa while Agatha perched on the other and Nicky began divvying out presents.</p><p>“Stockings first!” Nicky declared, hurrying toward the fireplace. “One for me, one for Mama, and one for Rio.”</p><p>Rio nearly choked on her coffee. “What?”</p><p>Sure enough, hanging on the mantle were three stockings, each with a name embroidered in gold thread, a blue one for Nicky, a purple one for Agatha, and a green one for Rio. Nicky unhooked it and placed it on Rio’s lap, grinning at her shocked expression.</p><p>“Do you like it?” he asked.</p><p>“He thought you should have a stocking, too,” Agatha told her. “So you were really part of the family.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes watered. “Thank you.”</p><p>“No crying on Christmas!” Nicky chastised, his little voice firm.</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I’ll do my best.”</p><p>Their stockings were filled with an assortment of chocolates and candies. Rio realized that Agatha had probably filled her own, and made a mental note to make sure she got something for her next year before shaking her head. Next year? The thought filled her with warmth even stronger than the coffee in her cup. Nicky continued piling gifts beside each of them, leaving his own much larger pile in the middle of the floor.</p><p>“Okay, that’s all of them,” he said with a nod. “Who wants to open their present first?”</p><p>“Well, since you have the biggest pile, I think you should go first,” Agatha replied. Based on the way the boy was practically vibrating with excitement, Rio definitely agreed with this choice.</p><p>“Hmm… I’m gonna open… this one!” he declared, choosing a lopsided-looking gift and holding it up proudly above his head.</p><p>“That one’s from me, if the crappy wrapping job didn’t give it away,” Rio told him.</p><p>Nicky tore into his gift with zero reserve, ripping the paper away to reveal an orange plush underneath. His face scrunched in confusion as the bean-shaped plushie with a smiling face came into view.</p><p>“Uh… thanks?” Nicky said, holding it up. “What is it?”</p><p>Rio giggled. “It’s a kidney.”</p><p>For a moment, Rio was afraid that perhaps her sense of humor wasn’t hereditary, or that the joke hadn’t quite hit. But then Nicky’s eyes widened, and his confusion melted into absolute elation as he clutched the toy to his chest and laughed wildly.</p><p>“You gave me a kidney!” he exclaimed between peals of laughter. “Mama, Mama look! Rio gave me a kidney! A happy kidney.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “That’s adorable.”</p><p>Nicky clutched the stuffed kidney to his chest for a moment before extending his arms and giving it a pointed look. “He needs a name.”</p><p>“Oh, does he?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I’m gonna call him… Lucky,” Nicky declared, clutching it back to his chest. “It’s my lucky kidney. At least until you give me one of your real kidneys, Rio, then that can be my lucky kidney.”</p><p>“Perfect,” Rio declared. “Oh, and there’s something stuck to Lucky’s back.”</p><p>Nicky turned the plushie around in his lap to see where Rio had taped an envelope to the back side. He gently peeled off the tape and opened the envelope before gasping at the contents.</p><p>“Basketball tickets?” he asked, looking up excitedly.</p><p>“Yep, three tickets to see the New York Liberty,” Rio told him. “I hope you don’t mind that it’s the WNBA team.”</p><p>“Why would I mind?” he asked.</p><p>“Well, it’s the girls’ team,” Rio replied.</p><p>“So? Lots of girls play better than boys,” Nicky told her, still clearly confused.</p><p>“That’s true,” Rio agreed, very relieved that Agatha seemed to somehow be raising him with absolutely zero sexism.</p><p>“Mama, what did you get from Rio?” Nicky asked.</p><p>Agatha picked up a similarly-wrapped gift from her own pile and shook it lightly. “Hmm, what could it be?”</p><p>Nicky giggled. “Hurry up, Mama.”</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Agatha chuckled. She ripped the paper away to reveal another plushy, this one a sea otter. It was brown and very soft, Rio had made sure of that, and clutched to its chest was a smaller baby sea otter. Agatha’s jaw dropped as she looked at it. “Oh.”</p><p>“I know it’s silly, but otters are your favorite,” Rio explained. She could feel her cheeks heating. “And it’s a mom, like you.”</p><p>Agatha stroked the soft brown fur gently. “I don’t think anyone’s ever given me a stuffed animal before.”</p><p>“Well, you deserve to have more soft things in your life,” Rio shrugged.</p><p>“Everyone needs a stuffy to squeeze when they get sad or upset,” Nicky interjected.</p><p>“Exactly,” Rio agreed. “And there’s one other part to your gift. Check the wrapping.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow creased as she dug through the wrapping and found a small piece of cardstock. She held it away from her face, squinting slightly as she read the text without her glasses.</p><p>“You’re invited to a special luncheon with Pumpkin and Clover, New York Aquarium’s resident…” Her voice trailed off and she looked up at Rio with wide eyes. “Is this a real thing?”</p><p>“I was afraid you might’ve done it before since you’re one of the aquarium’s benefactors, but I take it you haven’t,” Rio said with a grin.</p><p>“I didn’t even know it was something you could do,” Agatha said, her face slowly morphing into a genuine smile.</p><p>“What is it?” Nicky asked.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and read the card again. “You’re invited to a special luncheon with Pumpkin and Clover, New York Aquarium’s resident rescued sea otters,” she said. “Please call to schedule your meet and greet, during which you will be able to interact with and feed Pumpkin and Clover under the supervision of our animal care staff.”</p><p>“We get to feed the otters?” Nicky asked excitedly.</p><p>“Yep,” Rio replied, popping the p excitedly.</p><p>“That’s so cool!”</p><p>Agatha held the card in one hand and the otter plushies in the other. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Alright, Rio, your turn,” Nicky insisted.</p><p>“Hmm,” Rio said, looking down at the small pile of presents. She chose the gift bag labeled From: Nicky. “Let’s see what’s inside.”</p><p>She pulled out the tissue paper and her jaw dropped when she saw a yellow Nintendo Switch Lite and a handful of games.</p><p>“Nicky… Agatha, what…?”</p><p>“You told me you used to play video games on a Gameboy,” Nicky said with a grin.</p><p>“Nicky, this is too much,” Rio insisted.</p><p>“But you need your own so we can play together,” he said with certainty. “This way we can trade Pokemon and you can help me build my fortress in Minecraft. We can play together while we’re in the hospital and when we come home after our operations.”</p><p>Rio forced a pained smile onto her face. It wasn’t that she didn’t appreciate the gift, and she truly appreciated the thought behind it. But it was another reminder of the differences between them. She had expected something extravagant from Agatha— the woman couldn’t seem to help herself when it came to spending money on people— even if it still made her a bit uncomfortable taking such valuable gifts. But she hadn’t expected it from Nicky.</p><p>“He used his own savings to buy it for you,” Agatha told her.</p><p>Rio looked toward Agatha, who was looking at her with a knowing expression.</p><p>“I— I don’t know what to say,” she said finally.</p><p>“If it makes you uncomfortable, we can take it back, right Nicky?” Agatha said.</p><p>“Uncomfortable?” Nicky asked.</p><p>“It’s just… It’s a really expensive gift,” Rio told him.</p><p>“Oh,” Nicky said. “Yeah, I know. But I’ve never gotten you a present, Rio. So I wanted to get you something you’d like, and we can play together. I worked really hard to get it for you.”</p><p>“He did,” Agatha agreed. “He did extra chores for me and Wanda, even helped Lilia with her shopping and cleaning for today’s party to earn some extra money. And then he looked online to find one on sale so he could afford it.”</p><p>“I could’ve gotten a grey one for ten dollars less, but I know you lose things, and I thought yellow would be easier to see. So I helped Clint vacuum out his car for ten more dollars,” Nicky told her.</p><p>Rio’s heart gave a lurch as the tension eased from her shoulders. “You did all that for me?”</p><p>Nicky nodded. “Of course. I wanted you to have something special.”</p><p>“C’mere, mijo,” she said, holding her arms out for a hug. He came willingly, crawling into her arms as she started tearing up. “Thank you. I love it.”</p><p>“It’s just a Switch,” he muttered, clearly uncomfortable and a bit confused by her tears.</p><p>“It’s not the Switch, it’s how hard you worked for it,” Rio said, sniffling.</p><p>“Well, you’re welcome,” he said, clearly still confused.</p><p>“Alright, enough of the waterworks,” Agatha declared. “Nicky, go open another gift.”</p><p>Nicky returned to his pile of presents, choosing the largest one next, a large box that was almost half as big as he was.</p><p>“This one’s from Santa,” he said, pulling at the wrapping paper. The box inside was nondescript, and upon opening it, it revealed yet another box, this one oddly shaped, but Rio immediately knew what was inside. She reached for Agatha’s arm, and the other woman grinned at her excitedly as Nicky continued opening the box, still clueless. Finally a black case came into view, and Nicky gasped.</p><p>“No way!” he shouted, pulling the case free from the box.</p><p>“Open it up and take a look,” Agatha told him. She leaned closer to Rio. “I hope I got the right kind.”</p><p>“I’m sure you did fine,” Rio assured her as Nicky flipped the latches on the case.</p><p>Nicky pulled a beautiful acoustic guitar from the case, his entire face lighting up with joy. He looked from it to Rio to Agatha in a mixture of surprise and excitement.</p><p>“This is amazing!” he declared.</p><p>“Let’s see, mijo,” Rio said, beckoning him over.</p><p>Nicky hurried to sit between them, and Rio helped him adjust the guitar on his lap. It was a bit smaller than a regular guitar, perfectly sized for his body. Rio checked the tuning and adjusted a few strings, then showed him how to strum it.</p><p>“There you go, you’re a natural,” she said.</p><p>Nicky beamed, his face alight with excitement. He turned toward Agatha. “Thank you, Mama.”</p><p>“Don’t thank me, it was Santa Claus,” Agatha replied.</p><p>“Right…” Nicky said, looking at Rio and winking cheekily. “Thank you, Santa.”</p><p>“Not that anything can top the guitar,” Agatha said smugly, “but we have more gifts to open. And then we have to get ready to go to Lilia’s. So we better get to unwrapping some presents. Chop chop.”</p><p>They made quick work of the rest of the gifts, covering Agatha’s living room with ripped gift wrap and tissue paper. Agatha had gifted Rio and Nicky each an overnight bag with a set of soft pajamas, slippers, and a few books to pass the time, which she described as their post-surgery survival kits. Nicky got a few more games for his Switch, and Agatha had given Rio a giftcard so she could purchase games for hers. Nicky gifted Agatha a vibrant purple blanket, a stack of books— mostly trashy romance and murder mysteries, Rio noted, along with one pastry cookbook— and a neck massager.</p><p>“Aunt Lilia helped me pick out the books, and Auntie Jen helped me get the massager,” Nicky explained. His face pinched into a confused expression. “She said it would help with the stick in your butt, er, well, she didn’t say butt, she said the bad word for butt. But how do you get a stick in your butt? And how would a massager for your neck help your butt?”</p><p>“Jesus Christ,” Agatha muttered, rubbing her temples as Rio bit back laughter.</p><p>“It’s a phrase, mijo, it just means Mama is tense,” she snickered.</p><p>“Oh,” Nicky said, his expression still confused as he looked at Agatha. “So you don’t have a stick up your—?”</p><p>“No, no I do not,” Agatha sighed. “But when I catch your Auntie Jen, I might just shove one up hers.”</p><p> </p><p>They spent most of the day enjoying their new gifts. Nicky helped Rio set up her Switch, and then spent hours showing her how to start building in Minecraft. Agatha watched them from the sofa, curled up under her new blanket with one of her new books in hand, her glasses perched on the tip of her nose. Then, later in the afternoon, they all headed upstairs to get ready for Lilia’s party.</p><p>When Rio stepped out of the bathroom, she was surprised to see an outfit already laid out on the foot of the bed: an emerald sweater dress, black tights, and a pair of black boots. A small note was laid on top of the dress, written in Agatha’s messy handwriting:</p><p>Thought you might want something nice to wear to dinner.</p><p>Rio picked up the dress, her fingers tracing over the soft fabric, and raised it to her face. It smelled like Agatha’s detergent, and she could even smell a hint of the other woman’s perfume. This wasn’t a new purchase— although the tights appeared to be unworn— this dress belonged to Agatha. She dressed quickly, careful not to get makeup on the neckline of the dress, and then stood in front of the floor mirror in the corner of the room.</p><p>“Oh, good, you found it.”</p><p>Rio nearly jumped out of her skin at the other woman’s voice— she hadn’t even heard the door open. She looked behind her in the mirror to see Agatha in the doorway, leaning against the doorframe, already dressed in a black lace dress with a deep scooping neckline. Her makeup was already done and her hair was piled atop her head in a loose but elaborate bun, to Rio’s disappointment.</p><p>“I wasn’t sure what you were planning to wear, but I know you didn’t bring much besides t-shirts and sweatpants,” Agatha continued, stepping further into the room. “And while everyone who’s coming to dinner would understand if you showed up in pajamas, all things considered, I didn’t want you to feel like the odd one out. This should fit you, it’s a bit tight on me.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip. “You’re letting me borrow your clothes?”</p><p>“Well, I’ve seen how uncomfortable you are with gifts, so I thought giving you a new dress or taking you shopping for a new outfit might make you uncomfortable,” Agatha replied. “Not to mention the fact that it’s a holiday, so most stores are closed, and calling in a special favor on today of all days seemed rude.”</p><p>“Yeah, you’re right,” Rio said. She could feel the flush warming her cheeks. She looked back at her reflection as Agatha stepped closer behind her.</p><p>“Green is your color. I’m glad it fits,” Agatha said, looking her up and down. She raised her hands, almost absentmindedly, to Rio’s hips, adjusting the fabric so that the vertical ribbing was straight. “There, now you’re perfect.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught in her throat. Agatha’s hands lingered on her hips, warm and sure against her. Rio’s mind went back to that moment in the dressing room, where they had stood like this. Much like then, she was tempted to turn around, to press her lips against Agatha’s. It would be so easy, and yet…</p><p>“You need makeup,” Agatha announced, turning on a heel.</p><p>Rio sucked in a much needed breath before turning. “I… have… makeup.”</p><p>“Come, pet,” Agatha beckoned, disappearing out the door.</p><p>Rio was torn between being offended and being aroused, and before she could fully process those emotions, her feet were moving and she was following Agatha down the hall and into her bedroom. She had never been in this room before; though she had been curious, her respect for Agatha’s privacy had won out over her desire to snoop. It was only slightly larger than the guest room, though it had a king-sized bed against one wall opposite a large window. The main difference, Rio realized, was the size of the bathroom and closet. Agatha sat her down at a vanity between two open doors, and through one Rio could see a large bathroom with a soaking tub and walk-in shower, while through the other she saw a meticulously-organized walk-in closet with more clothes than Rio could imagine wearing in a lifetime.</p><p>“You’re doing my makeup?” Rio asked as Agatha pulled out a makeup pallet?”</p><p>“Unless you’d prefer that I didn’t?” Agatha clarified, raising one sharp brow.</p><p>“No, no, go for it,” Rio said, sitting up primly. Agatha gestured for her to close her eyes so she could apply eyeshadow. “So this dinner, is it a family thing, or…?”</p><p>“No, just colleagues and friends,” Agatha replied, brushing pigment onto her eyelids. “Lilia’s family does their celebration on Christmas Eve. And Pat, well, they’re estranged from most of their family.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, unsure what else to add.</p><p>“Pat is trans non-binary,” Agatha explained. “They were assigned male at birth, but now use she-they pronouns. Her family is very religious and traditional, so…”</p><p>“I see,” Rio said sadly.</p><p>“It’s their loss,” Agatha continued. “Pat’s a lovely person. She and Lilia complement each other well. Where Lilia’s artistic and eccentric, Pat’s very analytical and down-to-earth. They worked in finance for thirty years before helping develop a stock trading app, and now she’s pretty much retired. I think you’ll like them.”</p><p>“I look forward to it,” Rio said, looking up as Agatha applied mascara to her lower eyelashes. This close she could feel the warmth of Agatha’s breath on her cheek. “Do they have any children?”</p><p>“No, but that was by choice,” Agatha told her. “Their careers were their babies. I always admired that about Lilia, thought that would be me. But she was the one who made me realize that I had love to give a child, and pointed me towards adoption. In a way, she’s the reason you, Nicky, and I are here today.”</p><p>“Sounds like we’re lucky to have her,” Rio observed. “Like you’re lucky to have her.”</p><p>“I definitely am,” Agatha replied. “Even if she sometimes drives me insane.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I think that’s how most friends are.”</p><p>Agatha stepped back, assessing her work. “There. You’re perfect.”</p><p>Rio looked at herself in the mirror. Normally her makeup routine consisted of dark eyeliner, some mascara, and maybe a touch of dark eyeshadow if the event called for it. But Agatha had used green and gold makeup that mirrored the dress she wore.</p><p>“It brings out the green in your eyes,” Agatha noted.</p><p>“But I have brown eyes,” Rio argued, looking at herself closer in the mirror.</p><p>Agatha gave her a puzzled look. “You— Have you never noticed the green flecks in your eyes?”</p><p>“Not until right now,” Rio replied honestly.</p><p>“It’s one of the first things I noticed about you,” Agatha said, her voice soft.</p><p>Rio looked up at her, heart suddenly hammering in her chest. “Agatha—”</p><p>Before she could say more, Nicky’s voice sounded from downstairs: “Mama! Rio! We’re gonna be late!”</p><p>Agatha glanced at her watch. “He’s right, we’d better hurry.”</p><p>With that she rushed from the room, and Rio was left breathless, a strange mix of frustration and relief warring in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s home was a spacious townhome on the Upper East Side, less than a block from Central Park. The house was already bustling with people when they arrived, some familiar faces and some not. They were greeted by a tall person with long red hair that was greying at the temples.</p><p>“Agatha! Merry Christmas!” they greeted, their voice deep and warm as they pulled Agatha into a hug, followed by Nicky. “Look at you, you’ve gotten so tall!”</p><p>“He has, hasn’t he,” Agatha said proudly, ruffling Nicky’s hair.</p><p>“And this must be Rio!’ they greeted. “I’m Pat, Lilia’s partner.”</p><p>“A pleasure,” Rio replied, reaching out to shake their hand.</p><p>“None of that!” Pat insisted, tugging her forward before stopping herself. “Can I hug you? It’s okay if not, but I’m a hugger.”</p><p>Rio’s heart immediately softened. “Of course.”</p><p>“Good, good,” Pat said, pulling Rio into a tight hug. “You’re family now, afterall. Come in, make yourself at home. Lilia’s in the kitchen and I think Jen is with her. Agatha told us you don’t drink, Rio, so we made sure to stock some sparkling cider and there’s plenty of water and sodas if you’d like. Nicky, the kids are all upstairs in the lounge.”</p><p>Pat took Rio by the arm and began leading her around the main floor of the house, giving her the grand tour and introducing her to their guests. Finally they came to the kitchen, where Agatha was leaning over the large kitchen island, wine glass in hand, as Lilia stood over a plethora of colorful dishes.</p><p>“Rio! Bon Natali!” Lilia greeted, pulling her in and pressing kisses to both cheeks. “I see you’ve met my worse half, huh?”</p><p>“So that’s how it is?” Pat said, clutching their chest dramatically and feigning hurt at Lilia’s words.</p><p>Lilia let out a string of Sicilian that had Pat laughing as she pulled them down into a quick kiss. “You know I love you, mia vita, but get out of my kitchen.”</p><p>“Alright, alright! I’m going,” Pat chuckled as Lilia shooed them from the kitchen.</p><p>Dinner was a jovial affair, loud and boisterous. Over a dozen of Pat and Lilia’s friends were gathered in their home, and all of the adults piled into the dining room for a traditional Sicilian Christmas meal, with more seafood and pasta than Rio could remember eating in her life. Even though the people here weren’t related, it reminded Rio of her childhood, when her parents would alternate spending Christmas in Puerto Rico with her father’s family and spending Christmas with her mother’s Irish-American family. Rio sat sandwiched beside Agatha, and Jen and William sat across from them. Lilia sat at their end of the table, and Pat sat at the other, surrounded by her own coworkers and friends.</p><p>“Last week one of the interns almost burned the entire building down,” William said dramatically, finishing off another glass of wine.</p><p>“The copier overheated and set off a smoke detector,” Jen explained.</p><p>“And if I remember correctly, a lowly executive assistant once melted a coffee pot because he forgot to put in any water,” Agatha chimed in. “So maybe don’t give the interns too much grief.”</p><p>“Oh, please, as if he didn’t learn from the best,” Lilia snorted. “How many interns and assistants did you run off before he was hired?”</p><p>Agatha twirled her pasta around her fork. “It’s not my fault they were incompetent.”</p><p>“So you’re saying I’m exceptional?” William asked.</p><p>“You’re competent. There’s a big difference,” Agatha said, pointing her butter knife at him across Rio’s plate.</p><p>William’s phone buzzed and he grinned down at the screen, practically glowing as he typed a text. When he put the phone down, they all stared at him curiously.</p><p>“What?” he asked.</p><p>“Who was that?” Lilia asked.</p><p>“Nobody,” William said, only for his phone to buzz again.</p><p>Jen arched her neck to see the screen. “Who’s boyf?”</p><p>“What kind of name is that?” Agatha asked, wrinkling her nose.</p><p>“Oh my god,” William said, clearly exasperated.</p><p>“I think it’s short for boyfriend,” Rio told them.</p><p>“How on earth do you know that?” Agatha asked, turning toward her.</p><p>“I teach Gen Z,” Rio shrugged.</p><p>“Oh my god, Teen has a boyfriend!” Jen exclaimed.</p><p>“Are you even old enough to date?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I’m twenty-three!” William exclaimed.</p><p>“A child,” Lilia intoned.</p><p>“Why are you all so invested in my personal life?” he asked.</p><p>“Because you’re young and single, it’s entertaining,” Lilia replied with a shrug.</p><p>“They’re single too!” William argued, gesturing to Jen and Agatha.</p><p>“You forgot the young part,” Agatha told him.</p><p>“Hey, speak for yourself,” Jen defended.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed like a predator. “Oh, are you going to regale us with stories about the riveting late-thirties dating scene? I’ve been there, Jenny Kale, and it’s all downhill from there, trust me.”</p><p>“Downhill, huh?” Jen asked. “What about the date I set you up on, hmm?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped. “That’s— We’re talking about Teen’s dating life, not mine.”</p><p>“Ooo, no, I wanna hear,” William said, putting down his fork and leaning forward eagerly. “What does a date with Agatha Harkness entail?”</p><p>Rio suddenly wished she could sink into the floor. She did not want to hear about Agatha’s date. She would rather have the ceiling collapse on her again than hear about Agatha’s date. Maybe if she just excused herself to the bathroom…</p><p>“I can tell you,” Lilia said with certainty, placing her wine glass on the table. “French or Japanese?”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “French.”</p><p>“They went to Le Coucou for dinner. Agatha bought an entire bottle of the bordeaux. Agatha ordered the duck and her date ordered the…” Lilia paused and studied Agatha for a long moment, “Lamb. They talked, Agatha found her date dull, but not so much that she skipped dessert. They split the marjolaine. Then Agatha went back to her place and, well, clearly the sex wasn’t good enough to warrant a second date.”</p><p>William almost choked on his wine. Rio wished she could sink into the floor.</p><p>Agatha glared at Lilia. “I hate you.”</p><p>“I know you,” Lilia said with a shrug. “Did I get anything wrong?”</p><p>“We also had the tartare as an appetizer,” Agatha told her.</p><p>“Ah, well,” Lilia replied.</p><p>“And our night was interrupted by Rio’s roof collapsing,” Agatha continued.</p><p>“But everything else followed your usual modus operandi?” Lilia asked, raising a brow at her.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Yes, the rest went as usual.</p><p>“Wait, so all of your dates are the same?” William asked.</p><p>“I’m a creature of habit, so sue me,” Agatha huffed.</p><p>“All of your dates follow the same script and you thought Madeline was dull?” Jen asked.</p><p>“Just because my dates have a routine doesn’t mean they’re boring,” Agatha defended, swirling her finger around the edge of her wine glass. “And I wouldn’t say she was dull.”</p><p>“What would you say then?” Jen asked.</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips in thought. “I’m not sure there’s a term for it.”</p><p>“Try,” Jen pressed.</p><p>“We’re just not compatible,” Agatha explained, and then she cringed. “She wouldn’t stop talking about her ex. And she drank too much. She ordered multiple cocktails on top of the Bordeaux.”</p><p>Jen and Lilia both let out sympathetic “Ooo”s as William sighed, “Oh, that sucks.”</p><p>“Yeah, so, not a great first date,” Agatha summarised.</p><p>“Did you at least get laid?” Jen asked.</p><p>“Well…” Agatha began. “Not exactly.”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped around at that. What the fuck was that supposed to mean? Agatha had still been at her date’s home when Rio called her at two o’clock in the morning. Why else would she be there if they didn’t have sex?</p><p>“What do you mean, not exactly?” Jen asked.</p><p>“I don’t want to hear this,” William said, throwing up his hands defensively.</p><p>“Oh, grow up, Teen,” Lilia scoffed.</p><p>“She’s like my mom!” he exclaimed.</p><p>“Um, no,” Agatha said. “I am your boss. Boundaries.”</p><p>“Yes, boundaries. As in I don’t want to hear about your sex life,” William told her.</p><p>“Well, too bad, because the rest of us do,” Jen argued, turning to look at Agatha expectantly.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Teen, there are no sordid details,” Agatha assured him. “We went back to her place. Went to her bedroom. Started to fool around, and next thing I know, she’s snoring.”</p><p>They all stared at her.</p><p>“She fell asleep?” Jen asked, snickering.</p><p>“She was drunk off her ass,” Agatha huffed, sipping her wine again. “I’m just glad she made it back to her apartment before she passed out. People always act strange when I have Clint carry comatose women to their apartments.”</p><p>“Is that something he has to do frequently?” William asked, his eyes round with shock.</p><p>Before Agatha could answer, or continue with her story, Rio’s phone started ringing. She looked down to see Alice’s contact flashing on the screen.</p><p>“It’s Alice. I have to take this,” she said, standing and stepping away from the table.</p><p>“Is everything alright?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m sure it’s fine,” Rio replied, stepping away from the table.</p><p>Agatha nodded and went back to her story. “Anyway, after she fell asleep, I decided I might as well rest a bit as well, so I just… slept. I had barely closed my eyes when Rio called me in a panic.”</p><p>Rio stepped out of the dining room and made her way through the kitchen, to the patio outside, letting the door click closed behind her before answering the phone. “Hey, Alice, Merry Christmas!”</p><p>“Hey, Rio,” Alice replied, her voice tense.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Is Lorna okay?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Huh? Oh, yeah, Mom’s fine,” Alice told her. “But, um, listen: I just got a call from Alexei. Turns out the water damage was more extensive than they initially thought. More of the ceiling collapsed last night and this morning.”</p><p>“Oh shit,” Rio muttered, sitting on one of Lilia’s patio chairs.</p><p>“Yeah…” Alice sighed. “I’m looking at booking a hotel for when I get back, and I was wondering if I need to book a room for both of us, or if Agatha is cool with you staying with her for a while longer.”</p><p>“I’ll check with her, but she’ll probably be okay with it,” Rio replied.</p><p>“And are you okay with it?” Alice asked.</p><p>“Of course, why wouldn’t I be?” Rio asked. “It’s a good chance to get to know her and Nicky even better. He’s super pumped about me staying with them, so I’m sure he’ll be thrilled.”</p><p>“And it has nothing to do with the fact that you’re kind of in love with Agatha and you want to fuck her so bad you’re about to spontaneously combust?”</p><p>Rio nearly choked on her own tongue. “Wh— What?”</p><p>“Don’t pretend I’m wrong,” Alice said. “Are you going to be able to control yourself while you’re living with her? Or are you finally going to get your head out of your ass and admit how you really feel?”</p><p>“Oh my god, I’m not some nymphomaniac,” Rio scoffed. “Just because I want something, or in this case someone, doesn’t mean I’m going to throw caution to the wind and do something stupid.”</p><p>“So that’s a no to getting your head out of your ass, too, then?” Alice asked.</p><p>“Alice, we’ve talked about this,” Rio replied. “Things are good right now. Not perfect, but we’re figuring it out. The risk if things went south is just too great.”</p><p>There was a click of the door opening and closing behind her.</p><p>“I gotta go, Alice. I’ll let you know about the hotel room,” she said quickly. “Merry Christmas. Give Lorna my love.”</p><p>Alice sighed. “Merry Christmas, Rio.”</p><p>Rio disconnected the call and turned toward the house. She assumed that Agatha had come to check on her. “That was Alice. Apparently the water damage was worse and more of the ceiling fe— Oh, hey, Jen.”</p><p>Jen was leaning against the wall beside the door, digging through the pocket of her powder-pink coat with one hand. In the other, perched between two fingers, was an expertly-rolled joint.</p><p>“Aha, there it is,” she said, pulling out a gold lighter with her initials inscribed on the side. “Sorry, I know you’re not, um…”</p><p>“No, it’s fine. I was just going inside anyway,” Rio said, standing and smoothing down her dress. She started to go back inside, brushing past Jen and reaching toward the door.</p><p>“You know, in business, we have this process called risk-benefit analysis,” Jen said, just as Rio was about to open the door to go back inside.</p><p>Rio froze and looked at her in confusion. “Oookay?”</p><p>“It’s a methodical approach where we weigh the risks and benefits of a venture before deciding to move forward,” Jen continued. “The goal is to assess whether the potential gains are worth the potential negative consequences.”</p><p>“Why are you telling me this?” Rio asked, her brow furrowing in confusion.</p><p>Jen lit the joint and took a long drag, holding her breath for a moment before exhaling a cloud of smoke.</p><p>“I may have overheard a bit of your conversation,” Jen admitted. “I didn’t mean to, I just… caught the tail end.”</p><p>“Okay, and?” Rio demanded, crossing her arms over her chest. She hadn’t picked up her coat on the way out, not expecting to be outside for very long, and the dress Agatha had loaned her didn’t do much to protect against the frigid December air.</p><p>“And I’ve had similar conversations with Agatha,” Jen told her. “About you.”</p><p>Suddenly Rio didn’t care about the temperature. “What?”</p><p>Jen shifted from foot to foot anxiously. “I shouldn’t tell you this. But I’m so tired of watching you two dance around each other when anyone with eyes can see that you have feelings for each other.”</p><p>“Agatha… has feelings… for me?” Rio stuttered out.</p><p>“Oh my god, how Nicky ended up so smart with you contributing DNA and Agatha raising him I will never know,” Jen scoffed. “She kissed you, didn’t she? I swear, lesbians are so fucking dumb.”</p><p>“Aren’t you also a lesbian?” Rio asked.</p><p>Jen just waved her hand dismissively. “To answer your question: Yes, she has feelings for you. She’s been trying to ignore them for the past three months and it’s driving all of us absolutely insane.”</p><p>“Why would you set her up with someone if you knew she had feelings for me?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Because even though you two both clearly like each other, you’re both too chicken to do anything about it,” Jen replied. “And I get that, I do. You’re good moms, putting Nicky first and yourselves last. But you both deserve to be happy, whether it’s with each other or with someone else. And if you and Agatha weren’t going to pursue a relationship, then I thought it was best that she move on and try going out with someone else. But, well, we see how that turned out. Incompatible.”</p><p>“I’m sure there’s someone out there for her,” Rio said. Sure, Agatha might like her back, but that didn’t change anything. They both knew that this couldn’t go anywhere. And Jen was right, Agatha deserved to be happy.</p><p>“Sure, yeah, there’s plenty of women out there who would love to date Agatha Harkness. She’s rich and beautiful and once you get past the ice bitch exterior she’s one of the most caring people you’ll ever meet. Women would fall over themselves to date her.” Jen looked hard at Rio, her dark eyes piercing in their intensity. “But as long as she wants you, none of those women even matter.”</p><p>Rio gulped, swallowing down the knot in her throat. “So what do you think I should do?”</p><p>Jen took another drag on her joint, and Rio found herself wishing she could take a hit as well, but she banished that urge as quickly as it popped into her mind. Finally, Jen exhaled.</p><p>“I just think you should reconsider all of the risks and all of the benefits,” she said. “Because you might just find that the benefits actually outweigh the risk… Just something to think about.”</p><p>The door opened, startling them both, and Agatha almost walked into Rio as she stepped out into the bright sun.</p><p>“Hey, I wondered where you two had run off to,” she said brightly, looking between them.</p><p>“Just getting some fresh air,” Jen replied, holding up her joint.</p><p>“Yes, I see that,” Agatha said, stepping closer to Rio. “I hope she didn’t divulge too many of my secrets?”</p><p>“What?” Rio squeaked.</p><p>“No, I was just telling her about that one time on assignment at Paris Fashion Week when you were flirting with a model and tripped over your Louboutins,” Jen lied.</p><p>“Still not as embarrassing as you getting food poisoning and puking all over Anna Wintour’s shoes,” Agatha shot back. She stepped closer to Rio and ran her hands up and down her arms. “You’re shivering, doll. Come on, let’s get you inside.”</p><p>“Good idea,” Rio nodded, trying not to completely melt into Agatha’s touch.</p><p>The rest of the party went by in a blur. Rio tried to concentrate on the conversations around her, but all evening her mind kept coming back to Jen’s words. In the risk-benefit analysis for pursuing a relationship with Agatha, she knew the risks well. But the benefits? She hadn’t allowed her mind to venture down that path, too afraid of the disappointment that might follow. But as she sat beside Agatha on the sofa, Nicky on her opposite side, as Pat played piano and they sang a mixture of Christmas carols, broadway tunes, and jazz standards, she let her mind imagine, just for a moment, what that life would be like.</p><p>“Hey, you okay?” Agatha asked, nudging her with her shoulder.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio replied. “I’m just… I like this. Christmas. With you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, the corners of her eyes crinkling. “I like it, too.”</p>

<p>
<span>They decided that Rio would stay with Agatha until after the transplant surgery, which was scheduled for the last week in January. It gave Rio and Alice time to file with their renters insurance, and figure out exactly what they planned to do moving forward. It meant that Rio could receive care from the home nurse Agatha had hired to help with Nicky’s recovery after the surgery, if she needed it. And it meant that Rio could spend more time with Nicky, which was a definite plus. It should’ve been great. It should’ve made things easier. But it didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Living in Agatha’s apartment was the most exquisite torture Rio had ever endured. It had been three weeks. Only three weeks. Three weeks, and she was losing her goddamn mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On one hand, she loved it. She loved waking up and helping Nicky get ready for school. She loved making coffee while Agatha prepped their breakfasts. She loved coming home from classes and lessons to take Nicky to dialysis, or play Switch or guitar with him. She loved alternating nights to cook dinner with Agatha or, even more often, dodging and weaving as they teamed up to prepare a meal. She loved quiet nights curled up on one end of the sofa, Agatha on the other, with Nicky between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hated that every night ended with her going to the guest room and Agatha going to her own room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was domestic. It wasn’t perfect. They argued. Apparently Rio’s tendency to kick her shoes off beside the living room door was a fire hazard. Rio’s sleep schedule— or, rather, lack thereof— was also an issue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha wasn’t perfect either. Her inability to knock before entering a room, even an occupied guest bedroom was a problem. Her overbearing need to know where Rio was at all times caused several arguments.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another issue: Agatha didn’t wear a bra in the privacy of her own home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t an issue, or it shouldn’t be. Agatha could do whatever she damn well pleased in her own home. Hell, Rio didn’t usually wear a bra when she was hanging around her own apartment. She wasn’t judging Agatha, not at all. It was just… distracting, that’s all. Here Rio was trying to be a polite house guest and she’d catch herself staring at Agatha’ chest. They’d be cooking dinner and she’d brush past and feel Agatha’s nipples against her back. They’d be sitting on the sofa after dinner and Rio would get distracted mid-sentence by how soft Agatha’s breasts looked beneath her pajamas, by the way the tips poked through the fabric.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was a simple lesbian, so sue her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t just the bra thing. Being around Agatha made it much harder to remember why she was so against being in a relationship with her. Agatha was so many things Rio wanted in a woman, beyond being absolutely gorgeous and sexy as hell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was super smart, probably because she read all the time— fiction, non-fiction, it didn’t matter, she almost always had a book of some sort in her hands. Nine times out of ten, if Rio asked a question about something random, Agatha knew the answer, or at least knew something related to the topic. Watching her help Nicky with his homework was fascinating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her patience with Nicky was awe-inspiring. It wasn’t always reflected with adults, which made it all the more obvious that it was a trait Agatha had developed and honed specifically for her son. She was firm with him, but gentle. Rio found herself watching their interactions, trying to glean what she could, learning to mother her son from the woman who did it best.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha was… kind. Rio was aware that many people would say otherwise. Agatha Harkness was known for making models cry, politicians curse, and interns crap their pants on a regular basis. Her sharp tongue and patronizing tone could make even the toughest person feel miniscule. And yet, if someone was able to prove themselves worthy of Agatha’s support, she would be their biggest champion. Rio had seen it with William, in the small glimpses she saw of Agatha’s work life. Agatha pushed her assistant to the brink of insanity on a regular basis, but she also made sure he ate lunch regularly, stocked his favorite coffee creamer in the office workroom, and even let him leave early for a date with his new beau— something hitherto unheard of from Agatha Harkness. And she made sure that his hard work was generously compensated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When it came to the select few people that Agatha deigned important enough to care about, she was exceedingly generous and fiercely protective, character traits that had made Rio uncomfortable at first. Why did Agatha need to know everywhere Rio was going and when? So that she could make sure Rio had a driver, a lovely young woman named Kate. Why did Rio need a personal drive— who also doubled as a body guard— when subways and taxis existed? Because it was safer, and Agatha wanted to keep Rio safe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it wasn’t just those traits that made Rio want Agatha. It was the way she hummed while she was cooking, lost in her own world. It was the way she laughed, loudly and without reservation, until she snorted, whenever Rio and Nicky traded corny jokes and terrible puns over the dinner table. It was the way her eyes got all soft and warm whenever they were sitting on the sofa and Nicky wordlessly crawled to lay half on top of her, his body molding to hers as it had done since the day she brought him home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was torture, sweet torture, living with Agatha. And every day, Alice and Jen’s words played in Rio’s mind on repeat.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>If what you’re feeling for Agatha is more than just physical attraction, then you might need to rethink your plan to not pursue anything with her.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I just think you should reconsider all of the risks and all of the benefits.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I think you owe it to yourself to figure it out. And you owe it to Agatha, and Nicky, too.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Because you might just find that the benefits actually outweigh the risk…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>And every day, Rio thought that maybe, just maybe, they were right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a Tuesday afternoon. Agatha was still at the office, and Rio had picked Nicky up from school after teaching her morning classes. They had spent some time practicing guitar before Nicky was supposed to work on his homework, but then he had broken a string.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Typical. Not a surprise. Not difficult to fix.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So Rio set about fixing the guitar string while Nicky worked on his homework. She was focused, carefully removing the broken string before placing the new one on the pin and winding it carefully around the tuning peg. Out of the corner of her eye she watched as Nicky worked on his homework, squeezing something in his hand. She didn’t think anything of it: he often kept a fidget of some sort in his hands while he worked on his assignments. Rio clipped the tuner onto the headstock and began slowly and methodically tightening and stretching the string until it reached the desired pitch, her focus solely on the guitar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um, Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just a minute, mijo, I’ve almost got it,” she said, strumming the string as she turned the tuning peg until finally the tuner read the correct pitch. She played a quick succession of chords and sighed. “There, good as— </span>
<em>
<span>HOLY SHIT WHAT DID YOU DO?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s long hair had all fallen forward around his face. But instead of flowing, his hair was covered in blobs of sticky, sparkly, neon green goo.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I got my slime in my hair,” Nicky said, his eyes filling with tears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How the fuck did you—?” Rio exclaimed, but cut herself off. Her voice was coming out more aggressive than she meant. She took a deep breath as she set the guitar aside and hurried closer to him. “How did you get slime in your hair?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was sticking it to my face ‘cause it felt neat,” Nicky explained. “And then it got stuck. And I tried to get it off but then more got stuck.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at Nicky’s head with wide eyes. She reached for his hair, carefully touching the slime. It was thick and sticky and coated every tendril. But, as she inspected further, at least it was only on the hair right around his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she said, trying to appear calmer than she felt. “Okay, um, maybe you can just wash your hair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah?” Nicky asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “Yeah, you just go take a shower and it’ll wash right out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think we should call Mama?” Nicky asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nooooo,” Rio replied quickly. Agatha would kill her. “There’s no need to worry her. Just go wash your hair and everything will be fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Famous last words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“RIOOOOOOOO!” Nicky howled from the bathroom less than ten minutes later.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ran in, panicked. “What’s the matter?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s worse!” Nicky sobbed from the other side of the shower curtain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh shit,” Rio muttered. “Let me see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But I’m naked!” Nicky exclaimed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed. “If it makes you uncomfortable, you can cover yourself with a towel. But, I mean, I technically grew all of you inside my belly and that includes your balls and penis. Nothing I haven’t seen before, kiddo, and not what I’m gonna be looking at right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky pulled the shower curtain aside, covering himself slightly with his hands. His hair was now covered with shampoo, the suds slightly greenish from the slime, but instead of fixing the problem, the slime had now spread to his entire head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, new plan,” Rio said. “Let’s rinse the shampoo out and we’ll put in conditioner. It’s slicker, it should make the slime come out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The conditioner did not, in fact, make the slime come out. On the plus side, it didn’t appear to make things worse, not that Rio was sure it could get any worse. Nicky stood in the middle of the bathroom, towel around his waist, as Rio poked and prodded at the slime in his hair. Rio carefully examined the green gelatinous mass, tugging on a small blob, but it was still firmly attached to his hair, pulling painfully at his scalp for a moment before she released it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think we should call Mama now?” Nicky asked, staring at himself in the mirror with wide eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded at his reflection. “Yeah, unfortunately, I think we’re gonna have to call Mama.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She called Agatha, who immediately agreed to leave the office early. By the time Agatha got home, Rio and Nicky were in the kitchen. Nicky had on his pajama bottoms and no shirt. Rio’s blouse was absolutely soaked with a mixture of water, shampoo, and olive oil. Nicky was bent with his head over the sink, and Rio was arched over him, a bottle of olive oil in one hand and a fine-tooth comb in the other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How the fuck did he get slime in his hair?” Agatha exclaimed, taking in the scene. Her eyes had a haunted look that Rio had never seen before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky looked up, his eyes lighting up with relief. “Mama!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t move, mijo, I’ve almost got this chunk,” Rio warned, dousing the strand she was working on in more olive oil and slowly combing the hair. A ball of slime slowly formed, growing larger and larger until it finally reached the ends of the hair and fell into the sink with a dense </span>
<em>
<span>plop.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing?” Agatha demanded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I Googled </span>
<em>
<span>how to remove slime from hair</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio replied. “It’s a surprisingly common problem, apparently. According to Tiktok, the best way to get slime out of hair without damaging it is by using olive oil to break the bind and then combing it out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her. </span>
<em>
<span>“According to Tiktok?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“There were multiple videos,” Rio nodded, her eyes focused on the hair in her hands. “Another video said vinegar would dissolve it, but apparently it could also dissolve his hair so… I went with olive oil.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Again, how exactly did he get slime in his hair?” Agatha asked, massaging the bridge of her nose. “Where did he get the slime in the first place?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I won it out of the prize bucket at school!” Nicky told her excitedly before his demeanor soured. “I shouldn’t have tried to put it on my face. It got in my hair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And how did it get in the hair on the back of your head?” Agatha stepped closer prodding gingerly at the hair in question. Her expression morphed into one of disgust at the slimy texture and she nearly gagged, quickly pulling her hair away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It spread when I washed it,” Nicky replied. “Rio said it would wash out, but it didn’t, it just got worse.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Traitor,</span>
</em>
<span> Rio thought as Agatha glared at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t Google how to remove the slime </span>
<em>
<span>before </span>
</em>
<span>telling him to shampoo it?” Agatha asked incredulously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought it would wash out,” Rio defended. “I didn’t realize they made it with some industrial strength glue. I swear, you could mortar bricks with this crap.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio spent the next few hours painstakingly combing the slime from Nicky’s hair, only pausing briefly so they could both eat dinner. The pieces at the ends of his hair weren’t so difficult, but the closer she got to his scalp, the harder it was to loosen the slime, and the more painful it was for Nicky. He sat like a champ for the first hour or so, but after dinner, the tears began. Rio didn’t blame him; he was tired and uncomfortable, bored and irritated and anxious all at the same time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can’t you just cut it off?” he asked through tearfilled eyes as Rio tried to work loose a particularly stubborn bit of slime on the very top of his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But your hair’s so handsome, mijo,” Rio argued.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But it hurts, and I want to go to bed,” Nicky whimpered. “Mama, can I please cut my hair?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve always liked it long,” Agatha pointed out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, but this is… ‘stenuating sir-stances,” Nicky whined.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Extenuating circumstances,” Rio corrected. She looked up at Agatha. “He’s not wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked sadly at the long locks of his hair. She stood from where she had been perched on one of the barstools, carefully supervising the slime extraction and offering as much moral support as possible. She ran her fingers through one of the slime-free strands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve always loved his hair long,” she whispered, just loud enough for Rio to hear it. She sighed. “It’s too late to go to a stylist.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky tensed below their hands. Rio looked at Agatha with an apologetic and pleading expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But I think I know someone who can help,” Agatha continued, rubbing Nicky’s back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thirty minutes later, Pat and Lilia were at the door. Pat had a set of clippers and a pair of shears, and Lilia had a bottle of wine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For emotional support,” Lilia explained, uncorking the bottle and pouring herself and Agatha a healthy glass before sitting in the empty barstool. “You know, back in my day, kids just got gum in their hair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really? Back when dinosaurs walked the earth?” Agatha teased, but her heart clearly wasn’t in it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Pat had Nicky sat in a dining room chair, a spare bedsheet draped over his shoulders. She was softly explaining each piece of the clippers to him as she put a guard over the blade.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I haven’t used these in a while, but I promise I know what I’m doing,” she assured him. “When I was growing up, my mother would do all of our haircuts at home, so I learned from her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mama, you should learn how to cut my hair!” Nicky exclaimed, looking at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think we should leave that to the professionals. And Pat,” Agatha replied, her voice shaky. As Pat turned on the clippers and brought them up to Nicky’s hair, Agatha quickly downed her entire glass of wine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, but she didn’t reply, instead refilling her glass and sipping intently, her eyes never leaving Nicky as the hair began to fall to the floor. Rio could see the tears welling up in Agatha’s eyes, and she cursed herself. She glanced at Lilia, who gave her a sympathetic shrug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ten minutes later, it was done. Unfortunately, due to how much the slime had spread, Pat wasn’t able to salvage much hair to style. Instead Nicky’s once long locks were gone, and the hair he had left was in a half-inch buzzcut all over his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know it’s not what you’d hoped for, but I think he looks quite handsome,” Lilia said, and Rio knew the woman wouldn’t sugarcoat her opinion just to make them feel better. Rio agreed with her. Objectively, Nicky did look quite handsome. But the change was drastic, and it would take a while to adjust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Remember, it’s just hair and it grows back,” Pat said, holding the mirror in front of Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And it’ll probably be much easier to keep clean and tidy while you’re recovering from your operation,” Lilia added.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky stared at his reflection for a long minute before his face broke out into a wide grin. He giggled. “Now you can see my ears wiggle!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt a rush of relief that Nicky didn’t seem upset by the end results. Then she looked at Agatha, bracing herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped forward, reaching her hands out to cup Nicky’s face. She stared at him for a long moment before smiling a toothless smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like it,” she lied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky, however, didn’t pick up on the falsehood. His entire face lit up and he hugged Agatha tightly around the waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like it too!” he declared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sniffled. “Why don’t you tell Lilia and Pat goodnight and then go take a shower and get ready for bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But I already took a shower,” Nicky said, confused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, but since then you’ve been drenched in olive oil, and if you don’t wash it off Lilia might just eat you,” Agatha told him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, that is a terrible stereotype,” Lilia protested. “I may be a Sicilian witch, but I don’t eat children, even ones marinated in olive oil.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky giggled. “Good night, Lilia. Good night, Pat. And thank you for my haircut.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anytime, handsome,” Pat said with a wink. As soon as Nicky was up the stairs and out of earshot, Pat turned to Lilia. “This is why we never had children.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re exactly right, mia vita,” Lilia agreed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After Pat and Lilia left, Rio got Nicky into bed. When she came back downstairs, Agatha was sweeping up the mess in the kitchen. As Rio watched, Agatha carefully extracted a strand of Nicky’s hair from the pile and laid it on the counter. Once she had finished cleaning, she took the piece of hair to the living room. The album Rio had given Nicky was sitting on the side table; they had been gathering photos of Agatha’s family and Nicky’s childhood and adding them to the album. Agatha opened the album to one of the pages, and carefully taped the strand of hair into the book.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay?” Rio asked, stepping into the living room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will be,” Agatha sighed. She ran her fingers over the lock of hair wistfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifted anxiously from one foot to the other. “Are you angry?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze at that, looking up at Rio with wide eyes. “With you?” Rio nodded nervously. “No, I’m not angry with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt the tension leave her body as she sat on the end of the sofa opposite Agatha with a relieved huff. “Oh, thank god.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled ruefully. “I’ve been doing this whole mom thing for a while, Rio. I don’t expect you to have eyes on him every second. You were only doing something else for a few minutes and he managed to do something foolish in the blink of an eye. Besides, it was only hair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure seems like more than that,” Rio observed, scooting a bit closer so she could see the album page Agatha had chosen. It had a photo of the three of them that they had taken at Christmas, and a copy of the picture from the aquarium. Apparently Agatha felt that Nicky’s first major haircut needed to be memorialized among all of their other shared experiences as a family. Agatha was still looking at the hair with longing and teary eyes. Rio nudged her shoulder. “You wanna talk about it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sniffled. “It’s silly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No it’s not,” Rio assured her. “I promise it’s not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just… I really loved his hair,” Agatha told her, voice breaking as she said it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stretched out a tentative hand toward where Agatha’s was resting on the sofa cushion. Before she could think better of it, she took Agatha’s hand in hers and squeezed. Agatha looked down at their hands, jaw dropping momentarily with surprise, before she schooled her features again. But she didn’t let go of Rio’s hand, instead curling her fingers even more securely into Rio’s grasp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When I was a little girl, my mother insisted that I have long hair,” Agatha said, her voice soft. “She didn’t take care of it herself, of course, that was the nanny’s job. And it wasn’t an easy task, my hair has always been thick and unruly, so every day I would sit for an hour each morning and an hour each night as the nanny brushed through all the tangles. For years I begged to cut it, but I was always told no. Then, as I grew older, I started to take pride in my hair. By the time I was ten it was so long it almost touched my thighs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then, one summer, my nanny took a vacation. The poor woman hadn’t taken a day off in years, and she had more than earned it. My parents decided that I was old enough that I could do without the Nanny for two weeks. Father probably assumed that Mother would step in and care for me,” Agatha’s expression darkened. “She did not. For two weeks I was basically feral. I slept when I wanted to, ate whatever junk food I could pilfer from the kitchen, played and roamed the grounds all day. I spent hours in the pool, got the worst sunburn of my life, and only bathed once in that entire time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, imagining it. Agatha, young and snaggle-toothed, her hair wild behind her as she ran through a nondescript mansion. Agatha, fair and freckled, turning pink and then red from the sun as she laughed and splashed in a pool.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“By the time my mother realized that she should actually give a shit and make sure her only child was alive, my hair was a matted mess,” Agatha continued, her words drawing Rio out of her imaginings. “She was so angry. She tried brushing it, but it hurt, and I screamed and cried. She told me to shut up and called me a plethora of horrible things. Then finally she… she got a pair of kitchen shears and she…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha mimed scissors cutting with two fingers, her voice breaking too much to continue. Her other hand’s grip on Rio’s hand was so tight that it hurt, but Rio didn’t let go, didn’t try to shake her off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When my father saw it, Mother told him I had cut my hair myself,” Agatha told her, inhaling sharply to stop her impending tears. “Mother took me to a salon and they cut my hair off short, to my ears. For the next six years I wasn’t allowed to grow my hair out past chin-length. It was only after I was presented to society that Mother allowed me to grow my hair longer, insisted on it really. She said no man would want to marry me if I looked like a short haired dyke.” Agatha snorted at that. “Ironic, really.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The pieces were falling together in Rio’s mind. “You didn’t want to cut Nicky’s hair because of what your mother did to yours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wanted to give him autonomy over his own body, hair included,” Agatha corrected. “And when I saw the slime in his hair, it was like I was ten years old again with all my hair matted together, except it wasn’t me this time, it was him, and now I was my mother.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You took care of him,” Rio assured her. “You didn’t… He got slime in his hair because of his own childish impulsivity and momentary lack of judgment. Your mom fucking neglected you for two weeks. And you didn’t hack his hair off with scissors, you called someone who knew what they were doing, who you trusted to take care of him. Agatha, you are the furthest thing from your mother.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think he’ll hate me?” Agatha asked, her voice breaking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, sweetheart, no. Fuck no,” Rio said, squeezing her hand tight and scooting closer to her side. “You listened to what he wanted and needed and you made the choice that made him most comfortable. And yeah, I’m not gonna lie, he might get upset later when he realizes his hair is gone, but he’s not going to be upset with you. He loves you, and he knows you love him and that you always, always do what’s best for him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was quiet for a long moment, but when she spoke again the tears spilled over her cheeks. “It’s silly, but I keep thinking, what if this morning was the last time I ever brushed his hair, and I didn’t even know it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He might grow it back out again,” Rio pointed out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He might. Or he might keep it short. Or, if he does grow it out again, by the time it gets long he’ll have figured out how to care for it on his own and he won’t need my help.” Agatha sniffed again and reached up with her free hand to wipe her eyes. “It’s stupid—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not stupid,” Rio corrected, handing her a tissue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“— I should be happy that he’s growing up, that he’s becoming independent,” Agatha continued, blotting at her tears and running mascara. “But it’s bittersweet. You know, I don’t remember the last time he asked me to carry him? I mean, he’s still a string bean, I could pick him up and carry him in an emergency. But when he was little he would always run to me with his arms up, wanting to be picked up and carried around. Then one day he did that for the last time, and never did it again, and I didn’t realize it. I don’t remember the last time I picked him up and carried him on my hip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I remember the last time I fed him,” she said with a grin. “I picked up the spoon and he shook his head and said </span>
<em>
<span>No, Mama, I do it. I do it. </span>
</em>
<span>And he picked up the spoon and started feeding himself. That was his favorite phrase for a long time. </span>
<em>
<span>I do it. </span>
</em>
<span>I remember being so proud of how smart and independent he was. It wasn’t until later that I realized it meant he was growing up, and that he wouldn’t need me anymore. And don’t get me wrong, I’m </span>
<em>
<span>happy </span>
</em>
<span>about that. But I’m also sad. Every milestone is like that, every first and every last. Especially the lasts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio studied Agatha as a bittersweet expression took over her features. Her eyes were glassy, the blue darker than usual from her crying. She didn’t think she had ever seen Agatha quite this soft, this vulnerable. The privilege and the trust Agatha was putting in her by allowing herself to be like this wasn’t lost on Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you ever think about having another?” Rio asked. “Another kid, I mean. Biologically or adopting again?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have absolutely zero desire to be pregnant, so that’s a hard pass,” Agatha told her, shaking her head in disgust. “But I’ve considered it. Financially I can care for another child, obviously. But as far as time and energy and attention goes, I don’t think I could give another child everything they need. I don’t want to have to rely on a nanny because I’m too busy to care for a second child.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What if you weren’t by yourself?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused. “You mean if I had a partner?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Partner… wife… yeah,” Rio shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha studied her for a long moment. “I think… perhaps… with the right person, I might want another. If they wanted another, that is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed hard. The idea of Agatha with someone else, raising Nicky with someone else, having another child with someone else, made a pit form in her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But this is all speculative,” Agatha sighed, pulling Rio out of her spiral. “Nicky is more than enough, especially when he pulls stunts like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled. “Excellent birth control.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmhmm,” Agatha nodded. “What about you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about me?” Rio asked, relaxing back into the sofa cushions now that most of the tension seemed to be gone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think you’ll have more children?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So much for the tension being gone. Rio shifted to curl her feet beneath her, and Agatha did the same, though it was a bit more awkward for her since she was still wearing a pencil skirt from work. When they finally got comfortable, they were halfway facing each other but leaning against the back of the sofa. Their hands came untangled in the process, but as they sat Agatha’s hand began idly fiddling with Rio’s where it lay against the cushions, her fingertips tracing over the lines on her palm and down each digit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have some trauma from the pregnancy with Nicky,” Rio said finally. “Not physical, just… My therapist called it Birthmother Syndrome. Apparently it’s so common that they have a name for it. The whole time I was pregnant with Nicky, everything was tainted with this overwhelming sense of dread. Every milestone, every doctor’s appointment, seeing him on the ultrasound, feeling him move. The things that should’ve been joyous and beautiful couldn’t fully be that because they all meant I was getting closer to the day I was going to give him up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand smoothed over Rio’s, but she didn’t hold her. The warmth of her palm, though, and the rough feeling of the skin against Rio’s was grounding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“On top of that there was the trauma from his conception, and the mental distress from withdrawal,” Rio continued. “The pregnancy itself wasn’t so bad, honestly. I only threw up a handful of times in the first trimester. Everything with his development was right on schedule. Physically I was fine. But mentally I was a mess. So the idea of reliving that? I’m not so sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused, fighting the tears now bubbling up in her own eyes. Even without actually crying, the repressed tears made her nose and sinuses clog up, making her voice sound nasally and weak. Damn emotions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But it would be different, if you did it again,” Agatha pointed out. “You’d be keeping them this time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio agreed. “But… I dunno. It would still be hard, I think. And then having a kid, raising them… I’d definitely need to see a therapist, to deal with all of the baggage.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s valid,” Agatha nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Plus with the career I’ve chosen, I’m going to be busy,” Rio continued, trying to move on from the heavy emotions. “You’ve seen how weird my schedule is, and that’s as a student. Life as a gigging musician isn’t always stable. I don’t know how fair that is to a kid. Then again, I have friends who make it work. But they have partners they can depend on, who help make ends meet both financially and with time and effort.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what you’re saying is, you might consider it with the right partner,” Agatha surmised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe,” Rio agreed. “There’s a lot of what ifs.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s fair,” Agatha nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio relaxed back into the cushions, suddenly sleepy, but she had one more thing she needed to say. “Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m really glad you adopted Nicky,” she said, her voice sleepy but certain. “Seeing you with him, it’s healed some of that trauma. Knowing he’s happy and loved and has a mom like you… That’s all I ever wanted for him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s cheeks flushed slightly, and she looked away from Rio’s gaze shyly. “Thank you. That… that means a lot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s true,” Rio said before yawning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled. “We should go to bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t wanna move,” Rio grumbled petulantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, you’re so like him,” Agatha sighed. “Fine, close your eyes for a few minutes, but then we’re going to bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re staying with me?” Rio asked, her voice bright.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you want me to,” Agatha replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, please,” Rio nodded, tugging at Agatha’s hand until she laid back against the cushions as well, her face just inches away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The last thing Rio heard, as she drifted into sleep, was Agatha’s soft snores.</span>

<p>Rio hurried into the lobby of Agatha’s office in a panic. It was Friday afternoon, and the transplant surgery was scheduled for Monday morning. It was her last day teaching classes, and she had spent every break between blocks organizing her office at NYU, making sure that everything was prepared for her absence, and just as she was finishing up she had received a text message from Agatha.</p><p>
<em> AH: Emergency! Meet me at my office ASAP! </em>
</p><p>Rio had attempted to call before she went down to the subway, but Agatha didn’t answer. So she was left to panic the entire ride uptown, half of her mind imagining every terrible scenario it could come up with while the other half tried to calm her down. Had Nicky’s condition worsened? Had something happened? Had he been in an accident? Was he hurt? Had the little imp run away <em> again? </em>The only thing that calmed her a bit was the fact that she had summoned Rio to her office, not to her apartment or worse, the hospital.</p><p>When Rio stepped out of the elevator doors onto the twenty-fifth floor, she looked to her left and then to her right, trying to remember which direction led to Agatha’s office.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Rio looked around to see a familiar face in the hallway of the bullpen.</p><p>“Lilia!” Rio exclaimed.</p><p>“How are you darling?” Lilia asked, pulling Rio into a familiar hug. She didn’t wait for Rio to reply. “My Pat hasn’t stopped talking about you, you know. I think she’s taken with you. A lesser woman might be jealous, but I know my Pat, and I know that you only have eyes for one person. You’re here to see Agatha, I take it?”</p><p>Lilia spoke so quickly that she might as well have been speaking Italian. Rio blinked at her, processing her words, but she chose to only focus on the last bit. “She texted me that there was an emergency.”</p><p>“Hmm,” Lilia hummed, looking at Rio. “Well, come with me. If it’s an emergency, we shouldn’t keep Agatha waiting any longer.”</p><p>Rio followed her through the busy bullpen, dodging people left and right as they rushed around the office.</p><p>“It’s a madhouse today. Agatha insisted on finalizing the January and February issues before she goes on leave,” Lilia explained. “Fair warning, Agatha almost had Billy’s head this morning for bringing her coffee with oat milk instead of almond milk, and she made two interns cry.”</p><p>Rather than her office, Agatha was in the middle of the bullpen, looking out over a large conference table. Mocked-up pages were all laid out in front of her, and she looked over them with sharp eyes and a deep frown. Her hair was loose and fell in big waves around her shoulders, and one side looked permanently bunched up where she continuously ran her fingers through it in stress. A pair of glasses were perched on her nose— not the tortoiseshell pair she kept at home, but a large golden frame. Rio wasn’t sure which pair she preferred, but she knew that Agatha looked hot either way.</p><p>“Who approved this spread?” Agatha demanded. “I told you not to put the section on tech and the section on renewable fabrics beside one another.”</p><p>“Both are focused on green initiatives,” one of the employees spoke up, but it only incensed Agatha further.</p><p>“The entire issue is focused on green initiatives, you idiot!” Agatha shouted. “But going from futuristic metallics and jewel tones to natural fibers and earth tones is giving me a fucking headache.”</p><p>“So we put the article about Morgan Stark’s wedding between the two?” another employee interjected. “A tech heiress with a green wedding. A palate cleanser of sorts?”</p><p>Agatha blinked at the young woman before looking down at the spread and back at her. “What’s your name again?”</p><p>“America Chavez, Miss Harkness,” she replied.</p><p>“Good eye, Miss Chavez,” Agatha commended her, and the young woman’s cheeks flushed with pride. “Rearrange the spread and then we’ll move on to February’s issue.”</p><p>“Yes, Miss Harkness,” the team chorused, beginning to carefully rearrange the pages as Agatha turned away from the table and toward where Lilia and Rio stood waiting.</p><p>“Agatha, if you make any more employees cry, HR is going to have words with you again,” Lilia warned as she approached.</p><p>“It’s not my fault they continue to hire incompetent—” Agatha’s voice broke off as her gaze finally fell on Rio. “Oh! You’re here.”</p><p>“You said it was an emergency,” Rio said, frowning as Agatha walked past her toward her office. “Is Nicky alright?”</p><p>Agatha turned abruptly at that. “What? Of course. Why would you think something’s wrong with Nicky?”</p><p>“Because you said it was an emergency,” Rio replied. She thought that was obvious.</p><p>“Did I?” Agatha asked, feigning ignorance.</p><p><em> “Emergency! Meet me at my office ASAP!” </em>Rio quoted, raising the pitch of her voice to an obnoxious mimicry of Agatha’s. Beside her, Lilia barely restrained a snort.</p><p>“I do not sound like that,” Agatha huffed, sitting in her office chair. She gestured for Rio to sit across from her before folding her hands beneath her chin, looking like she was about to negotiate a very serious business deal. “I need a favor.”</p><p>“Oh-kay,” Rio said suspiciously. She did things for Agatha all the time, as Agatha did for her now that they were sharing a living space. But the way Agatha had called her here, and the way she was acting, made Rio apprehensive. “What is it?”</p><p>“I’ve been invited to the Met Opera for tonight’s premier of <em> Orfeo ed Euridice,” </em>Agatha explained.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened in surprise. “The opera?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha nodded. “I’ve been a patron for years. I was going to turn down the invitation, what with yours and Nicky’s surgeries on Monday, but then I found out that my ex-wife also made a large donation and is going to be there.”</p><p>“Bitch,” Lilia muttered, surprising them both. Apparently they had both forgotten that she was still standing in the doorway. When they turned to look at her, Lilia shrugged. “What? It’s true. Agatha, the entire time you two were together, she never once showed interest in the opera, even though you loved it. The few times she deigned to accompany you, you practically had to beg her to go. And now, when you’re one of the Met’s biggest benefactors and are about to be publicly honored as such, <em> now </em>she suddenly has a passion for the art? Give me a break.”</p><p>“Well, Daphne has always had a flair for the dramatic and a disdain for anything that brings me joy so you’re probably correct,” Agatha sighed, turning back to Rio. “She knows that I enjoy the opera, and she also knows that I try to avoid attending the same functions as her, because I have zero desire to open old wounds. So by attending the opera herself, she thinks her presence will make me avoid it, taking away something that I love.”</p><p>“But why would she do that?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Because she’s a bitch,” Lilia interjected. “Also, sources say that she and her current wife are going through marriage counselling, but it’s more like mediation before divorce. And her polling numbers are down, partially because of her marriage problems.”</p><p>“But what does that have to do with you?” Rio asked, looking back at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Daphne enjoys manipulating others. Manipulating me. The more success and happiness I accrue, the more she enjoys fucking with me.”</p><p>“That’s terrible.”</p><p>“That’s my ex,” Agatha sighed. “Suffice it to say, I had good reasons for the annulment.”</p><p>“Sounds like it,” Rio muttered.</p><p>“Anyway,” Agatha continued, sitting up straight and resuming her business-like pose. “I was hoping you might accompany me tonight.”</p><p>Rio blinked in surprise. “What?”</p><p>“Daphne expects me to stay home and avoid her,” Agatha explained. “Defying her expectations by not only showing up to the opera but showing up with a date? That would truly get under her skin.”</p><p>“So let me get this straight,” Rio said, rubbing her temple. “You want me to pretend to be your date and go with you to the opera just to spite your ex?”</p><p>“Well, when you put it that way, it sounds pathetic,” Agatha said with a frown.</p><p>“No, pathetic is your ex trying to manipulate you after you’ve been divorced for over a decade,” Rio stated. “But why don’t you just get an actual date? I’m sure there are plenty of women who would agree to accompany you.”</p><p>“I don’t want—” Agatha cut herself off, and then she sighed. “I could ask someone else. But I don’t want to subject them to Daphne’s vitriol if we do run into her, and she’ll likely make sure that we do. The only way to prepare them for that would be to tell them everything I just told you, and there’s no one else that I trust with that part of my past.”</p><p>The weight of Agatha’s words settled into her. “Oh.”</p><p>Agatha smiled wryly and she reached across the desk for Rio’s hand. “So, what do you say?”</p><p>Rio bit her lip. “Who’s watching Nicky?”</p><p>“I already arranged for him to go stay with Wanda and Nat.”</p><p>“So I’m a bit of a sure thing, is that what you’re saying?”</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“I mean, if this is how you ask a girl out on a fake date, then…”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha repeated, her voice low.</p><p>Rio tapped her chin thoughtfully. “If I do this, I expect something in return.”</p><p>“Really?” Agatha asked, her eyes widening. She sighed and reached for her purse. “Fine, how much…?”</p><p>“French toast.”</p><p>Agatha froze and looked at her with surprise. “What?”</p><p>“I want French toast tomorrow morning,” Rio told her. “You made it on Christmas and it was delicious and you haven’t made it since. I want French toast. That’s my price.”</p><p>“French toast?” Agatha asked, her expression morphing into a smile.</p><p>“And bacon,” Rio nodded.</p><p>“French toast and bacon,” Agatha repeated. “You drive a hard bargain, but I think I can make that happen. So, Rio, will you please accompany me to the opera tonight?”</p><p>Rio gave her a saccharine smile. “Of course, sweetheart, I’d be delighted.”</p><p>“Yasss!”</p><p>They turned toward the door of Agatha’s office where Lilia had been joined by Jen and William, and all three of them were squeezed into the narrow doorway. William’s hands were thrown up in excitement, as he had been the one to shout.</p><p>“Can we help you?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Can I dress Rio?” William asked, looking back and forth between them. “Please say yes.”</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio, who shrugged. “I’m not opposed.”</p><p>“Yassss!” William exclaimed again.</p><p>“Stop that,” Agatha warned. “Or I’ll make you supervise the interns while I’m gone.”</p><p>William hurried over to Rio and held her face in his hands. “Don’t worry, you’re in good hands.”</p><p>Rio shoved him away. “Ew. Never do that again, Teen.”</p><p>“Don’t tell me she’s rubbing off on you! You’re supposed to be the nice one,” William whined, looking between Rio and Agatha.</p><p>“Alright, calm down,” Agatha huffed, looking at her watch. “We need to leave here by five if we want to make it to the donors’ cocktail hour on time.” She gave William a pointed look. “Take care of her.”</p><p>“Yes, boss,” he replied, giving her a mock salute.</p><p> </p><p>Three hours later, Rio stared at her reflection in the mirror. “Are you sure about this?”</p><p>“Oh I am absolutely positive,” William said, his smile wild as he handed her a simple black clutch. “You’re stunning.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t argue with that assessment. The young man certainly knew his way around makeup and beauty tools. Her hair was expertly curled at the ends and more voluminous than she could ever achieve herself. Her makeup was sharp and precise— a dark smoky eye, red lips, and her skin looked flawless. A necklace dripping with diamonds hung around her neck and matching earrings were in her ears— Rio was fairly certain she needed a bodyguard simply for the jewelry currently on her person.</p><p>Below that, William had dressed her in a black evening gown with a sheer bustier bodice that tied in the back, and a long satin skirt with cut outs on the right hip and a high split up to the thigh. It was probably the most exposing and overtly sexy thing Rio had ever worn in her life. There was a faux fur coat for her to wear over it, but that was only for when they were outside.</p><p>“You still have time to change if you’re uncomfortable,” William said as she turned this way and that in front of the mirror one last time.</p><p>“No,” Rio sighed, her fingers splayed over the soft fabric on her hips. “The whole point is to make a statement. This definitely does that.”</p><p>“She’s gonna lose her mind,” William nodded, then his eyes widened. “Agatha’s ex, I mean.”</p><p>His phone buzzed and as he read the text, his grin spread to almost maniacal proportions. “They’re ready.”</p><p>“They?” Rio asked as he beckoned her out of the makeup studio. The bullpen was quiet, the magazine’s staff having gone home hours ago, but Rio could hear voices from the executive suite.</p><p>“Lilia and Jen took over styling Agatha,” William grinned. “She hates being fussed over, so I’m sure they’ve had a blast.”</p><p>“Jen, if you put on another coat of mascara I’m not going to be able to hold my eyes open!”</p><p>“Well forgive me for wanting to draw attention to your best feature!”</p><p>Rio grinned at their banter as they stepped into the door of Agatha’s office, but it was quickly replaced by a look of awe as she took in Agatha’s appearance. She was dressed in a brilliant purple velvet double-breasted blazer that was perfectly fitted to her body, and when she stood Rio saw that she was wearing matching fitted trousers as well. For anyone else it might seem like an ostentatious choice, a pitiful cry of <em> look at me, </em>but for Agatha Harkness, it simply screamed power.</p><p>“Your jaw is on the floor,” William whispered, and Rio promptly closed her mouth.</p><p>Agatha stepped over to her, her blue eyes tracing up and down the dress and her body in a way that made Rio wish that they were somewhere far more private. For a moment Rio could see the hunger there, burning hot as blue flame just beneath the surface.</p><p>“My goodness,” Agatha said, reaching out to slowly drag her fingers along the dark boning in Rio’s bodice, until her fingers met the soft skin of her hip. “You look…”</p><p>Rio’s mouth was suddenly dry, her breath caught in her throat. As good as that blazer looked, Rio wanted it gone, pants too. On second thought, Agatha could keep the blazer on, just as long as she fucked her. Agatha could have her right here, across the top of her desk, opera be damned. Rio didn’t care if it messed up her makeup, if it undid all of the work that William and Lilia and Jen—</p><p>Oh, right, they had an audience.</p><p>Lilia cleared her throat and Agatha’s perfect mask of control slipped back into place. Her hand dropped away from Rio’s hip, but the warmth stayed like a brand.</p><p>“You look gorgeous,” Agatha said, her voice low, like the words were just for her.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio said, feeling her cheeks flush. “You look… wow.”</p><p>Agatha smiled bashfully, smoothing down the front of her blazer. “You don’t think it’s too much?”</p><p>“No, it’s hot,” Rio assured her, and Agatha’s smile widened.</p><p>“Oh my god, you two are disgusting,” Jen groaned. “Have you called your driver yet?”</p><p>“Yes, Clint should be here,” Agatha told her, glancing at her phone. “Are you ready?”</p><p>“I think so,” Rio replied as William helped her into the coat. Once she had it on, she looked back at Agatha, who was looking at her slackjawed once again. “Shall we?”</p><p>“Yes, absolutely,” Agatha nodded, stepping forward and offering her arm. “Vamanos!”</p><p> </p><p>The lobby staircase of the Metropolitan Opera House was full of New York’s upper echelon, all generous donors, as servers circulated through the space with trays carrying hors d'oeuvres and champagne flutes. Rio was sharply reminded of the night she and Agatha met. Agatha had been in purple then as well, navigating the space like she owned it. It had been incredibly hot then, and it was incredibly hot now, perhaps even more so because now she knew Agatha as more than a stranger.</p><p>Being on Agatha’s arm was so, <em> so </em>easy. She made sure to introduce Rio to everyone they spoke to, and to include her in conversation whenever possible. Rio was fortunate that her musical background gave her a vast well of knowledge to draw on, so she was able to engage fully in most of Agatha’s discussions. And whenever she spoke, Agatha’s face would take on this glowing expression, her eyes fixed on Rio like she was the most fascinating thing in the room.</p><p>As they mingled, Agatha’s hand stayed wrapped around her waist, guiding her through the crowd. This would’ve been fine, polite even, if it weren’t for the risque cut of the dress William had chosen for her. The cutouts on the dress were placed so that every time Agatha reached for her waist, her hand landed on bare skin, and often it didn’t leave. Instead, Agatha’s fingers alternated between ghosting her fingers over Rio’s skin and firm presses into her flesh, and every single touch sent sparks along Rio’s nerve endings, straight between her legs.</p><p>This was how she died, Rio was sure of it. Cause of death: spontaneous combustion.</p><p>She had a brief reprieve, about half an hour before curtain, when she left Agatha to go to the restroom. As she suspected, her underwear was soaked, and she groaned in frustration. This was going to be a long night. She tugged the black lace up, and put her skirt down, only to realize that she could see her underwear through the cutouts on her hip. Rio scowled, attempting to tuck the fabric between the openings like William had done, but it was no use. Even the smallest of movements had the fabric showing itself. With one last frustrated sigh, Rio ripped the scrap of lace down her legs and tucked it into her purse.</p><p>This was <em> fine. </em></p><p>She washed her hands and made her way out of the restroom, looking around for Agatha. The other woman shouldn’t be difficult to find; the purple suit was like a beacon in a sea of black suits. Finally she found her, beside the bar, but she wasn’t alone.</p><p>Rio strode over to Agatha, trying to infuse every step with confidence. She pasted on a wide smile as she came to Agatha’s side, sliding her arm around Agatha’s waist with familiarity.</p><p>“Hello, sweetheart,” she greeted, pressing a soft kiss to Agatha’s cheek. “Were you able to get our drinks?”</p><p>“Yes, of course,” Agatha replied, reaching for a disposable champagne flute on the nearby bar. Rio sniffed the drink furtively before taking a sip. Ginger ale: Agatha had been paying attention.</p><p>The woman Agatha had been speaking to cleared her throat, and for the first time Rio let her attention fall to Agatha’s ex-wife. The Daphne Sinclair in front of Rio resembled the Daphne Sinclair she’d seen online all those months ago in the same way that a raisin resembled a grape. Her hair was bleach blonde, styled into a perfect chignon. She wore a bright blue dress and either had the best push-up bra known to man or she had breast implants— Rio suspected the latter. Her skin was the orangish shade of a bad spray tan and her makeup was heavy. When she smiled, her lips moved but the rest of her face was stiff, as if frozen. Too much botox, Rio surmised.</p><p>It was disconcerting to say the least.</p><p>“Oh, how rude of me,” Agatha said, looking between them. “Rio, this is Daphne Sinclair, New York state representative, and future senate hopeful, who also happens to be my ex-wife. Daphne, this is my lovely date, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“Charmed,” the woman said, but her nose wrinkled in what Rio thought was disgust. She couldn’t be sure, really, because of all the filler. But something about the way her grey eyes looked Rio over from head to toe made Rio’s skin crawl. “Let me guess, you’re a model?”</p><p>Rio laughed, a genuine laugh although the sound came out a bit stilted. “Oh, no, but thank you for the compliment.” She knew it hadn’t been meant as a compliment. “I’m a musician.”</p><p>“Ah, how… bohemian,” Daphne remarked.</p><p>“Rio is finishing her doctorate in music performance and composition. She’s a talented cellist, but perhaps an even more brilliant composer,” Agatha said, her voice rich with pride. Rio leaned further into her embrace, and Agatha’s free hand twined around her waist, her fingers skimming over the bare skin of her low back and side.</p><p>“An artist and an academic,” Daphne surmised. “That’s interesting. Not your usual type, Agatha, but she is very pretty.”</p><p>Rio tried to bite her tongue. She really did. But she didn’t appreciate being talked about as if she wasn’t standing right there, and the words slipped out of her mouth before she could drag them back in. “Oh really? How so?”</p><p>Agatha’s nails dug dangerously into Rio’s hip, but past that her calm and collected mask stayed in place.</p><p>“Well, I shouldn’t say anything,” Daphne said, sipping her drink.</p><p>“No, you already said something, so you should finish your thought,” Rio said, her voice dropping dangerously low. “What’s Agatha’s type, and why do you think I’m not that?”</p><p>Daphne sighed dramatically. “I suppose you should know, since you’re dating her. Agatha’s type is simple: women who benefit her in some way. Agatha doesn’t date because she’s looking for love, she dates because she’s looking for someone who can give her something. You can’t blame her, it’s what people like us do. She dated a tech mogul who helped her company expand their online presence. She dated a late night host to garner good press. She dated Wanda Maximoff because she wanted another mother for the kid she adopted. But here you stand, and I cannot for the life of me figure out what she’s trying to get from you.”</p><p><em> A kidney </em>, Rio wanted to say, but that was a completely different ballgame. Or maybe it wasn’t. She and Agatha might not actually be dating, but whatever their relationship was, it was built entirely on Nicky’s need for a kidney. Everything Agatha did for her, every act of kindness, every gift and favor, all stemmed from that need.</p><p>Beside her, Agatha was completely still, but Rio could practically feel the energy buzzing just beneath the surface, like a shaken bottle of soda just ready to blow as soon as the cap was removed. Agatha’s short nails were digging crescents into Rio’s hip, and she wondered briefly if she would have bruises from her fingertips.</p><p>“And what did she get from you?” Rio asked.</p><p>Daphne’s face puckered. “I think it’s probably best if she tells you that herself.”</p><p>“Why are you here, Daphne?” Agatha asked, finally finding her voice.</p><p>“Can’t a girl just enjoy a night at the opera?” Daphne responded, reaching forward to pluck some invisible blemish from Agatha’s blazer.</p><p>“You hate the opera, always have,” Agatha said, recoiling from her hand.</p><p>“No, I hated going to the opera <em> with you </em>,” Daphne corrected. She picked at her manicured nails. “Anyway, I think we’ve played nice for long enough. Let’s do it again sometime. The papers love when divorcees interact amicably.”</p><p><em> I’ll show you amicable, </em> Rio thought, and before she could think better of it she pitched forward, as if she had suddenly lost her balance. Agatha caught her by the arm, and in the commotion she threw what remained of her drink all over the front of Daphne Sinclair’s dress. The blonde let out a scream like a banshee as the liquid darkened the fabric.</p><p>“This is Givenchy!” she squealed, glaring at Rio.</p><p>“Send me your dry cleaning bill,” Agatha said quickly. “Rio, we’re going.”</p><p>She steered Rio away, her hand firm on the small of her back. Behind them her ex was still screeching, but Agatha paid her no mind, just led Rio toward the theater. Once they were in their private box, Agatha sat down in one of the red velvet seats and threw her head back with a sigh.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have done that,” she said, her voice low. Then her lips turned up into a smirk. “But, my god, am I glad you did.”</p><p>“She was a bitch,” Rio said, sitting beside Agatha. “She deserves worse. Although I’m not sure what could be worse than her face.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “She didn’t look like that when we were together.”</p><p>“I know. I googled you, remember?” Rio turned to look at her, curiosity gnawing at her. “Why did you marry her? What did you get from her?”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk immediately disappeared and the tension returned to her body. She cleared her throat and sat up straighter, crossing her legs and posing sharply. “I’d rather not talk about it.”</p><p>Rio recognized a shut down when she saw it. Nicky did the same thing, hell, even she was guilty of it from time to time. Luckily, that meant that she knew how to get around the barricades Agatha was trying to erect.</p><p>She sat back in her seat and looked down at the golden curtain. “When I was in middle school our orchestra teacher took us on a field trip to see <em> The Magic Flute </em>. I didn’t completely understand what was going on, to be honest.” She glanced at Agatha. “When did you see your first opera?”</p><p>Agatha was quiet, and for a moment Rio thought she might have shut down completely and wouldn’t answer. Then, finally, she spoke. “I was thirteen. I went with my father.”</p><p>“That must’ve been nice,” Rio said, hoping it would encourage her to keep talking.</p><p>“He was a big supporter of the Kennedy Center. Normally he would take Mother, but she was having one of her depressive episodes,” Agatha explained. “I was excited to have a chance to spend time with him, even if the opera sounded boring at first. But then the show started and I was just… enthralled. I didn’t understand how music in a language that I didn’t understand could still make me feel so much. It was just… remarkable. From that point on I begged Father to take me to more, and it became our thing.”</p><p>“That’s sweet,” Rio noted.</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Not exactly. Turns out, Father frequently had affairs with opera singers. It was easier for him to take me to the shows than my mother, and risk her finding out about his mistresses.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, surprised by that revelation.</p><p>“I didn’t know that at the time, though. All I knew was that it was the thing that I did to bond with my father. I loved it.” Agatha balled her hands up into tight fists in her lap. “Then he died, and I had no one to go with.”</p><p>Daphne’s words played in Rio’s mind again, and she wanted to find the woman and throw something else on her. Perhaps gasoline. And perhaps over her head this time. Or maybe she’d just skip the theatrics and go straight to physical violence.</p><p>“You asked what I got from her. From Daphne,” Agatha said, pulling Rio away from her violent fantasies and back to the present. “My father’s estate. That’s what I got. In his will, he had left me almost all of his holdings and savings. My mother was an heiress in her own right, and her half of their income and possessions would be more than enough to provide for her for the rest of her life. So Father had left his half to me. But Mother tried to get his will thrown out by saying he wasn’t of sound mind when he filed it. Daphne was the counsel that I retained to sue my mother and secure my inheritance.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said again.</p><p>“What Daphne said isn’t entirely false, I suppose,” Agatha sighed. “I do tend to date women who have done something beneficial for me. But it isn’t transactional, at least not in my mind. I just… When someone does something kind for me, I take it as affection. After she won the suit against my mother, I asked her on a date. I genuinely loved her, or I thought that I did, at least. And I thought the feeling was mutual. I didn’t realize until she invited her mistress to our wedding that it wasn’t. And since then, I’ve unpacked enough of our relationship to know that she never loved me, not really. She just loved having someone she could play with and manipulate and who would love her as she did so.”</p><p>“That’s terrible,” Rio murmured, reaching out for Agatha’s hand. She was holding onto her own thighs so hard that her nails made indents in the velvet of her suit. Rio pulled Agatha’s left hand into her lap and began methodically massaging it, relaxing each digit one knuckle at a time.</p><p>“I don’t know what it says about me that whenever someone does something nice for me I fall a little bit in love with them,” Agatha noted, her cheeks flushing pink at the admission.</p><p>“I think it’s probably a product of your childhood,” Rio remarked, digging her thumbs into the pad of Agatha’s palm.</p><p>“You and my therapist are in agreement then,” Agatha said with a forced laugh.</p><p>“I don’t think it’s a horrible trait, as long as the person you fall for returns your feelings,” Rio continued. “Clearly Daphne didn’t, but with the right person, it could work out. People meet their other halves in all sorts of different ways.”</p><p>“Yes, they do,” Agatha replied, looking at Rio with an expression that Rio couldn’t decipher. Before either of them could say anything more, the lights went down, and the overture began to play, drawing their attention to the stage.</p><p>The show was wonderful. At such a prestigious theater, Rio knew it would be. But even more fascinating than the show on the stage was Agatha Harkness. As the opera progressed, Rio found herself looking at Agatha more and more. There was something so endearing about the absolute rapture in her expression, the way she melted as soon as the music began, the way her eyes were fixed on the stage. Agatha was lost in the performance in a way even Rio had never experienced with opera, and it was an absolute treasure to watch.</p><p>The further the show progressed, the more comfortable Agatha became. She relaxed in her seat and leaned against Rio’s side. At one point she wrapped her arm around Rio’s shoulders, her fingers resting lightly on the opposite side, and her other hand came to rest on Rio’s thigh, the skin laid bare by the slit in her skirt. Agatha didn’t move, other than her thumb tracing slow circles against her skin, and Rio wasn’t even sure that she was aware of what she was doing. But the longer they sat, the longer the play went on, the more torturous it felt. Rio was sharply aware of her lack of underwear beneath her gown, and if Agatha’s hand moved just a bit further, she would be aware of it as well.</p><p>When the curtain call finally came, they practically had to detach from one another to stand and applaud. Once it was over, Agatha offered Rio her arm, and she took it without hesitation, leaning into Agatha’s side as they made their way through the crowd to the exit. It was as if something had shifted between them, as if some of the walls they had built between them had come down. Rio wasn’t sure what it meant, but for the moment she let go of her usual apprehension and let herself enjoy it.</p><p>
<em> What if the benefits outweigh the risk? </em>
</p><p>“I’ll get our coats,” Agatha said over the crowd, her lips so close to Rio’s ear that she felt the warmth of her breath. Rio shivered as Agatha headed toward the coat check, leaving her standing to one side of the lobby. She pulled her phone out of her purse to check it, smiling when she opened it to a goodnight text from Nicky and a photo he had taken of himself sandwiched between the Maximoff twins, all three of them crowded in one twin bed. She had a missed call from Alice, but she ignored it for now. She tucked her phone back into her clutch and looked up, hoping to see Agatha coming back from the coat check.</p><p>Instead of finding Agatha, Rio saw another figure heading straight for her.</p><p>
<em> Oh for fuck’s sake. </em>
</p><p>“Hela,” Rio greeted, plastering on a fake smile.</p><p>“Hello, Rio, darling,” Hela replied, leaning in to kiss her cheek. “My, don’t you look ravishing.”</p><p>“Thank you. And you look lovely as well,” Rio said. Hela did look nice, in a crisp white button up and black trousers with black suspender. “What brings you here? Doesn’t your show open next month?”</p><p>“Yes, but you know how these things are,” Hela sighed. “They like having us come out and support other casts, no matter how mediocre the performance. Although I will say, with you here, things just got far more interesting.”</p><p>Rio hummed noncommittally, looking around again for Agatha.</p><p>“You haven’t returned my calls,” Hela said, stepping closer.</p><p>“I’ve been a little busy,” Rio told her.</p><p>“Are you seeing anyone?” Hela asked.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to answer in the affirmative, but the words wouldn’t come out. Hela wasn’t the one that she was here to lie to. Not that lying to Hela would matter. It wasn’t like she wanted to be with her again. No, the woman Rio wanted was the one she was here with tonight, but none of that was real.</p><p>Sensing her hesitation, Hela grinned and reached for Rio’s hand. “Come on, let’s get out of here. I’ll buy you a drink. There’s a bar down the block that has a marvelous selection of wines, although I personally prefer the vodka.”</p><p>“Hela, you know I don’t drink,” Rio said with a scowl.</p><p>“Please, Rio, after a show like this? We all need a little something to loosen up,” Hela replied, rolling her eyes. She tugged at Rio’s arm. “And if the booze doesn’t help, I can always get something a bit stronger—”</p><p>“Hello, sweetheart.” Agatha seemed to appear out of nowhere, stepping around to Rio’s side and wrapping the fur coat around her shoulders. “Sorry it took so long, there was a line. And— Oh, I don’t believe we’ve met.”</p><p>As soon as Rio slipped her arms into the coat, Agatha wrapped her arm possessively around Rio’s waist, tugging her firmly into her side. Rio went willingly, melting into her embrace. She told herself that it was to sell their act, but in reality she was relieved that Agatha was back.</p><p>“Hela Odinsdottir,” Hela said, her eyes fixed on Agatha’s hand around Rio’s waist.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, lovely to meet you, dear,” Agatha replied, her voice saccharine sweet and bright. She looked between Rio and Hela with keen eyes. “So how do you two know each other? Hmm?”</p><p>“Rio and I met at NYU,” Hela replied. “I was a bit of a mentor to her, wasn’t I, darling?”</p><p>“Something like that,” Rio agreed, her forced smile growing more tense.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” Hela repeated, ignoring Rio’s reply entirely. “Aren’t you in fashion?”</p><p>“Fashion, media, finance, politics… I have my share of irons in the fire,” Agatha told her.</p><p>“It certainly sounds like it,” Hela noted. “How did you and Rio meet then?”</p><p>“Rio and her friend Alice were hired to play for my company’s fall gala back in October, and we’ve been seeing each other since,” Agatha explained, her grip on Rio’s waist tightening. That was the story they had formulated before they even arrived at the theater, choosing to stick with the truth as much as possible if Agatha’s ex asked any questions. But Rio hadn’t expected Hela to be the one quizzing them.</p><p>“Since October, you say?” Hela clarified, and Rio could practically see the gears in her mind turning as she did the calculations. Agatha nodded and Hela’s eyes narrowed. “I see. Well, that’s… interesting. It’s difficult for people like us to pursue relationships with people outside of our own industry. They rarely understand the work involved in being a working musician. The irregular schedules, the endless practicing, the financial instability. So often musicians end up dating other musicians because we’re the only ones who truly understand one another.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to argue, but Agatha spoke first. “Well, if that’s what Rio wanted, then I certainly wouldn’t stop her. She’s free to pursue whatever and whomever she thinks would make her happy.”</p><p>Rio turned to Agatha to try and remind her that they were supposed to be in a relationship and people in relationships didn’t say things like that, but before she could formulate a subtle reminder Hela laughed.</p><p>“Oh, an open relationship? How modern. Well, that certainly explains a lot.”</p><p>“That’s not—” Rio began.</p><p>“Well, if that’s the case, Rio darling, feel free to call me any time you’d like to have fun,” Hela continued, once again ignoring Rio’s interjection. “I very much enjoyed our last time together. I believe it was right around Halloween, wasn’t it?”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha stiffen beside her, but before she could respond, Hela laughed wildly. “You two should head out. I’ll see you around, darling, you have my number.”</p><p>With that, Hela sashayed away, grinning like the Cheshire Cat at the knowledge that she had just dropped a bomb on Rio and Agatha’s night.</p><p>“Agatha—” Rio began.</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha cut her off, dropping the arm that had been around Rio’s waist. “It’s not as if we’re actually together, Rio. You can fuck whomever you like. Although I’d think you’d make better choices than a person who tries to get you to break your sobriety.”</p><p>Before Rio could say anything else, Agatha turned on her heel and headed for the exit. For a moment Rio stood there, baffled. What the actual fuck just happened?</p><p>“Agatha! Agatha, would you fucking wait!” she hissed, nearly tripping over her heels as she hurried behind the woman. She finally caught up with her outside, in a crowd of people who were all slowly making their way to where a sea of yellow taxis were waiting at the curb. Agatha had her phone in her hands and a scowl on her face.</p><p>“Clint’s kid got sick, so he’s sending Kate to pick us up,” Agatha told her. “She’ll be here in about ten minutes, and she says it’s probably best if we meet her down the block, to avoid this mess.”</p><p>Before Rio could reply, Agatha had taken off again, shouldering past the crowd and down the sidewalk. Rio followed, cursing the stupid heels William had put her in, and the freezing January air.</p><p>“Agatha, could you wait just a fucking minute!” she shouted, stumbling over a drainage grate. “Ugh! Agatha, for the love of god, would you at least slow down.”</p><p>Agatha came to an abrupt stop and Rio nearly ran into her back.</p><p>“For fuck’s sake,” Rio muttered as Agatha turned around to face her.</p><p>“Why her?” Agatha demanded. Her eyes were wild, practically glowing in the dim light from the distant streetlights.</p><p>“What?” Rio huffed.</p><p>“Why her?” Agatha repeated. “Why would someone as smart as you be with someone like that?”</p><p>Rio crossed her arms over her chest. “That’s none of your business.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her in the dim light that came around the edges of the door. “You’re right, it’s none of my business.”</p><p>Agatha started pacing, her shoes click-clacking against the pavement. The nervous energy rolling off of her was downright palpable. Rio stared at her in confusion.</p><p>“You’re angry.”</p><p>“No, I’m not,” Agatha said indignantly.</p><p>“Bullshit,” Rio argued. Then it hit her. “No, you’re not angry, you’re jealous.”</p><p>“I’m not jealous,” Agatha huffed.</p><p>“You are,” Rio insisted.</p><p>“Just tell me why?” Agatha demanded. “Why were you with her? In October. Why?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio replied.</p><p>“Bullshit,” Agatha growled, turning Rio’s words back around on her.</p><p>“I don’t—” Rio cut herself off before she could repeat it again. She pulled her coat tighter around her as she thought. “I called her because I was upset. Because she’s familiar. She may not be good for me, but she answers when I call. I know her, I know her body, and she knows mine. It’s usually easy with her, the physical aspect anyway.”</p><p>“You were upset?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Rio scuffed her toe on the concrete and instantly regretted it. These shoes probably cost more than she made in an entire month of gigging.</p><p>“It was the day of Nicky’s soccer game,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha’s face fell in realization and she stopped her pacing. “You were upset with me so you decided to fuck her?”</p><p>“I never said it was a good decision,” Rio huffed. “And it wasn’t even— Nevermind.”</p><p>“No, finish what you were going to say,” Agatha challenged. Rio shook her head, and Agatha stepped closer. “Rio…”</p><p>“It wasn’t even good!” Rio exclaimed. “I couldn’t even… Fuck! It was just a few weeks after I met you and I thought she would distract me but it didn’t even work because the entire time all I could think about was you!”</p><p>Rio’s chest heaved as the admission settled heavy in the air around them. Agatha’s expression shifted rapidly, her eyes searching Rio’s face as if she could find the answers there. Then, with just a few shaky steps, she stepped into Rio’s space, her hands coming up to cup both sides of her face. For a moment, she just stared, her blue eyes wild but fearful.</p><p>“You asked for boundaries,” Agatha whispered. “But I don’t know if I can—”</p><p>Rio reached up and wrapped her hands around Agatha’s arms, making it impossible for her to pull away. Agatha’s eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>“What if it’s worth it?” Rio asked, her voice barely more than a breath.</p><p>“What if it doesn’t work out?” Agatha asked in return, her voice fraught with trepidation.</p><p>Rio took a deep breath. “What if it does?”</p><p>There was a brief moment, just before Agatha’s lips touched hers, a moment of absolute clarity when one singular thought filled Rio’s mind: <em> This will change everything. </em></p><p>But then Agatha’s lips were on hers, soft and barely there at first, but there nonetheless. Rio tightened her grip on Agatha’s arms, afraid she might pull away, afraid she might disappear, floating off into the ether, but she didn’t. Instead, Agatha took a sharp, gasping breath, drawing in the frigid night air, and then she kissed her in earnest.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was a force of nature, and she kissed like it. She was a wildfire in the middle of winter, dangerous and all consuming, and yet Rio wanted nothing more than to get closer to her flames. Every wall that they had put up between them fell, crashed to the ground and swallowed up in the blaze as Agatha’s lips moved against hers, deliberate and possessive. For a brief moment the kiss had felt tender, but that was swiftly gone, overtaken by desire that both of them had been pushing down for months. There was nothing slow about the kiss now, as Agatha opened her mouth wider to add tongue, simultaneously tasting and laying claim. There was nothing gentle as Agatha’s hands moved down, beneath the faux fur Rio wore to settle on her hips, gripping tight enough that Rio knew there would be finger-shaped bruises the next morning.</p><p>Rio groaned as her back hit the brick behind her, her coat just barely keeping the cold at bay. In front of her Agatha’s body felt like a blazing inferno, radiating heat as she pressed so close that Rio thought they might melt into one singular being. Rio buried her hands in Agatha’s hair, tugging it free from its loose low-ponytail until it fell in a dark cascade down Agatha’s back.</p><p>Agatha’s hands were still on Rio’s hips and her left hand, her dominant hand, was on the skin that the dress’s cutouts left bare. She clutched at the flesh and groaned, pulling her mouth away from Rio’s breathlessly.</p><p>“This fucking dress,” she moaned, hand dipping lower, to the slit on Rio’s thigh. “God, what it does to me.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Rio asked with a groan as Agatha’s hand slid down to her thigh.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha sighed, pressing one leg up into Rio’s core. For a moment Rio was reminded of the last time they kissed, in Agatha’s kitchen, but all similarities disappeared as the slit in the skirt parted so that Agatha’s velvet pants met her heated center.</p><p>“Fuck! Wait,” Rio huffed, trying unsuccessfully to move away from Agatha’s leg. Instead, the motion dragged her clit against the textured fabric, sending hot bolts of pleasure through her entire body. “I don’t want to ruin your pants.”</p><p>“Oh? Are you already that so—” Agatha’s voice cut off as her hand moved from Rio’s thigh to the apex of her thighs. Her fingers met nothing but skin, hot, slick skin. Rio groaned as Agatha’s fingers ghosted over the outside of her sex, touching but not quite touching, and her hips arched forward. Agatha looked up at her with dark eyes, her pupils blown until only the faintest sliver of blue could be seen. “Rio, have you <em> not </em>been wearing underwear this whole time?”</p><p>“I had to take them off before the show started, they wouldn’t stay in place with the cutouts,” Rio huffed, her hips bucking again. She needed Agatha to touch her, actually touch her, before she lost her damn mind.</p><p>Once again, Agatha’s face flickered through a range of emotions in front of Rio’s eyes, finally settling on a mix of determination and pure want.</p><p>“You’re so—” Her words were cut off by the sound of a car horn blaring. Rio glanced over Agatha’s shoulder to see a familiar black SUV pulling up to the curb and parking.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio muttered, face dropping into the crook of Agatha’s neck.</p><p>Agatha reluctantly pulled her hand from between Rio’s legs and pulled her leg back, smoothing Rio’s skirt into place as she did so.</p><p>“It’s probably for the best,” she murmured, taking Rio’s hand in hers as she stepped away. “Let’s go home.”</p><p>Rio’s legs shook beneath her as they walked to the car, and her mind felt just as unsteady. What did Agatha mean that it was <em> probably for the best? </em> She hurried to keep up, trying to catch a glance at Agatha’s face, hoping to read something, <em> anything </em>from her expression. But Agatha’s mask had already fallen back into place as they approached the waiting SUV.</p><p>“Miss Harkness, Miss Vidal,” Kate greeted as she opened the door for them. Unlike Clint, who was a consummate professional, Kate was young and hadn’t quite developed that same stalwart demeanor. From the wide grin on her face, Rio knew without a shadow of a doubt that she had seen them practically humping each other a block away from Lincoln Center.</p><p>They sat on opposite sides of the bench seat, six inches of space firmly between them. When Agatha crossed her legs, Rio caught sight of a dark patch just above the knee of her slacks and she immediately turned to look out the window as her cheeks turned scarlet.</p><p>Kate slid into the driver’s seat. “Shoo! Cold out there, huh?”</p><p>Neither of them responded.</p><p>“You two looked cozy, though,” Kate continued, glancing at them in the rearview as she shifted the car into gear.</p><p>“Just take us home, Miss Bishop,” Agatha ordered, and Rio caught her glancing her way in the reflection of the window.</p><p>The ride back to Agatha’s apartment was silent, but Rio’s mind was racing. Agatha’s mercurial nature and her ability to mask her emotions had Rio puzzled. One minute Agatha had her hand between Rio’s thighs, the next minute she was sitting in the SUV, checking messages on her phone as if nothing had happened. Could she really suppress her emotions so quickly and efficiently? Rio certainly couldn’t.</p><p><em> It’s probably for the best. </em>Agatha’s words were like a broken record in Rio’s mind. Did she really think it was for the best that they were interrupted? Rio sighed deeply. Perhaps she was right. For months Rio had been certain that they shouldn’t go down this path, that pursuing a romantic relationship was too risky. But with every passing day, it was getting harder for Rio to hold onto that restraint. For weeks Rio had felt like a powder keg ready to explode, so it really shouldn’t have come as a surprise that it had come to a head tonight, with emotions as high and raw as they were.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>She nearly jumped out of her skin at the sound of Agatha’s voice, and the brush of her hand against her arm. She looked around with wide eyes, and Agatha eyed her like a wild animal that might bite or run at any moment.</p><p>“We’re here,” Agatha said, nodding toward the building outside. Sure enough, the car had come to a stop in front of Agatha’s apartment building. Kate was already out of the car, making her way around to open the door for them.</p><p>“Right, yeah,” Rio muttered, gathering her things and unfastening her seatbelt. She slid out of the car after Agatha, hoping that her legs weren’t still wobbly. “Thanks for the ride, Kate.”</p><p>“You’re welcome, Rio— I mean, Miss Vidal,” Kate corrected quickly, eyes darting to Agatha. “Goodnight, Miss Vidal, Miss Harkness.”</p><p>“Goodnight, Miss Bishop,” Agatha dismissed, walking beside Rio toward the building.</p><p>As they stepped into the elevator, they still didn’t speak, didn’t touch. Agatha pressed the button for her floor and leaned against the wall with a sigh. Rio shifted from one foot from the other anxiously until she couldn’t hold it in any longer.</p><p>“What did you mean, <em> It’s probably for the best? </em>” she asked, the words coming out more clipped than she meant.</p><p>Agatha stared at her, dumbfounded. “I just meant it was probably for the best that Kate interrupted us. Neither of us needs a public indecency charge. Plus, it’s freezing out there. A warm apartment and a soft bed seems preferable to fucking on a public sidewalk, wouldn’t you agree?”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flushed at Agatha’s candor, but she nodded shyly. Agatha’s lips turned up in a sly grin, but she didn’t say anything else, didn’t try to touch Rio. The flame was still there, a slow burning ember just waiting until they reached Agatha’s apartment. The anticipation pooled in Rio’s lower stomach, sending a rush of arousal between her legs and making her heart race and her breath shudder.</p><p><em> They were really doing this, </em>she thought as Agatha led the way down the hallway. Rio stared at her back, at the way her shoulders moved beneath the purple velvet as she unlocked the door and gestured for Rio to step inside. After months of wanting, Rio would finally have Agatha again, and this time there were no time constraints, no locked bathroom doors, no friends waiting for her. It was just her, and Agatha, and an entire night of possibilities.</p><p>And yet, as they hung their coats up by the door, something still ate at her. One tiny thought in the back of her mind had her heart pounding until she heard it like a roar in her ears.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha said, pulling her out of her endlessly spiralling thoughts. Rio looked at her, really looked at her, and it was like looking in a mirror. Agatha’s mask was gone, replaced by the most expressive face Rio had ever seen. Rio could see her desire in her eyes, her concern in the set of her brows, her longing in the parting of her lips. Agatha stepped closer to her, cupping her face as she had when she kissed her not an hour before, but her touch held more than desire. It was careful, tender, as if she were holding something fragile and elusive in her hands. A breath passed, then another, and then Agatha leaned in.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered, pulling back slightly. Agatha froze, staring at Rio with confusion, before her expression settled into one of resignation.</p><p>“If you’ve changed your mind…” Agatha began, but Rio shook her head.</p><p>“No, I—” Rio’s voice cracked. She felt tears welling up in her eyes, and she cursed them. “It’s not that.” Agatha watched her patiently, waiting until Rio found her words. Finally, Rio took a deep breath, steeling herself to lay everything out in the open. “If we do this, I need you to know that it’s not just sex for me. I need it to be more, <em> so much more </em>. It has to be.”</p><p>Agatha melted, her expression turning softer than Rio thought possible. Her thumb stroked Rio’s cheek as a shudder passed through her body and she took a breath.</p><p>“It is more,” Agatha agreed, her voice soft but strong, sure. “I think, maybe, that it always has been.”</p><p>The roaring in Rio’s ears stopped and the last of her walls came crashing down as she finally kissed Agatha again. With every press of Agatha’s lips, every stroke of her tongue, any memory of a thought that this was a bad idea was banished from Rio’s mind. All she knew was that the goddess that she had wanted and needed for so long was finally hers.</p><p>And she needed more.</p><p>She ran her hands along the front of Agatha’s blazer, across the soft material, until she found the buttons. As much as she loved the way the luxurious fabric looked on Agatha, she was much more keen on what was underneath. She popped both buttons free and reached underneath, expecting to find skin, only to meet silk instead. She pulled away from Agatha’s kiss to look down, and saw that Agatha was wearing a cream-colored silk camisole with lace trim, and it was tucked into her pants. Rio’s mind warred between frustration and not touching skin and pure desire at how sexy the silk and lace looked on the other woman.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha questioned, her breathing shallow and her pupils blown wide as she looked at her.</p><p>“Up— upstairs,” Rio shuddered, burying her fingers in Agatha’s hair to tug her mouth back to her lips.</p><p>Agatha tried to follow her order— she really did— but she also seemed very reluctant to stop kissing her, and Rio didn’t want her to stop either. Walking backwards up stairs in heels while being kissed was just as difficult as one might imagine, and on the fourth step Rio missed her mark and lost her balance, landing on her ass with a squeal and a thud.</p><p>“Oh, shit, baby, are you okay?” Agatha asked, dropping to her knees. Her hands roamed over Rio’s body, checking for any injury.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio giggled, kicking off her shoes so that they landed at the bottom of the stairs. “Stupid heels.”</p><p>“You sure?” Agatha asked, her face still etched with concern.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio said, reaching up to cup her face. “Just help me up.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her, and her expression shifted from concern to hunger in less than a millisecond. Instead of helping Rio up, she laid her hand flat against Rio’s sternum and gently pushed her back against the stairs.</p><p>“What are you— <em> oh!” </em>Rio’s eyes widened as Agatha dropped to her knees a few steps below her.</p><p>“I can’t wait,” Agatha sighed, bending to kiss her. She couldn’t quite reach Rio’s face from where she knelt below her, so instead of her lips Agatha kissed her chest, the same spot where her hands had been, before turning her head to kiss and suck at the soft skin at the top of Rio’s breast.</p><p>“Oh fuck,” Rio groaned as Agatha reached around her and loosened the tie that held the top of her dress in place. Once it was untied, Agatha didn’t even bother taking it off. Instead she simply pressed her face beneath the fabric, kissing and licking until her mouth found Rio’s nipple. They both groaned at the contact, the sound reverberating through them until Rio wasn’t sure where she ended and Agatha began. All she knew was the warm, wet suction on her breast that was sending waves of pleasure coursing through her body.</p><p>“Don’t stop,” Rio pleaded as Agatha switched to the other breast, tongue laving flat over her nipple as blue eyes cut up to meet hers. Rio threw her head back as her hips bucked off the step and her feet scrambled for purchase. One hand reached behind her, gripping the iron stair railings for support, while the other tangled in Agatha’s hair. She needed Agatha to touch her so badly, but she couldn’t formulate the words to tell her. Instead she pulled at her hair, until Agatha released her nipple with a soft <em> pop. </em></p><p>“Tell me what you need,” Agatha said, her voice breathless. She sounded near ruin, and Rio hadn’t even touched her in return.</p><p>“Need you to touch me,” Rio choked out.</p><p>“I am touching you.” To prove her point, Agatha kissed the side of Rio’s breast, sucking hard enough that Rio knew it would leave a mark. Rio let out a high, keening cry as Agatha pulled back and grinned up at her.</p><p>“You’re evil,” Rio groaned, head dropping back against the steps.</p><p>Agatha’s grin only widened. “You just have to tell me what you want, baby.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a deep breath and gripped Agatha’s hair hard enough that it made her grunt.</p><p>“I want you to fuck me,” she said, her voice barely more than a growl.</p><p>“Do you want my fingers or my mouth?” Agatha asked before soothing the mark she had left with her tongue.</p><p>Definitely evil.</p><p>“M— mouth,” Rio stuttered.</p><p>Agatha gave her one last smile before moving down her body. She pushed Rio’s skirt out of the way, completely exposing her, and then her hands found the soft skin of Rio’s thighs.</p><p>“If I had known you didn’t have anything on under this dress, I never would’ve made it through the show,” Agatha told her before pressing a sucking kiss to the inside of her knee. “I would’ve had you right there in the middle of the theater, audience be damned.” Rio groaned at the image and Agatha smirked. “You would’ve let me, wouldn’t you? I bet you were dripping the entire time. Bet you ruined the seat.”</p><p>Rio groaned as Agatha’s mouth drew closer and closer to where she wanted her most. “Stop talking and— FUCK!”</p><p>Agatha dragged her tongue through Rio’s pussy in one slow motion. As soon as her tongue made contact, Rio’s back arched and she almost went tumbling down the stairs, but Agatha wrapped one arm around her hips, keeping her in place and steady. Rio’s knuckles turned white where she gripped the railing, and she pressed her other hand against Agatha’s head, not guiding or demanding, simply begging her to not pull away.</p><p>The first few times with a new lover were usually hesitant, two people learning each other’s bodies. It was all about the journey of discovery, not the end destination. At least, that was the bullshit Rio had always been led to believe.</p><p>Agatha was not hesitant. She devoured Rio like a woman starved, like her pussy was the most delicious thing she had ever tasted. There was no teasing, no tentative exploration. She dragged her tongue over Rio’s clit several times before moving lower to fuck her with her tongue, and then she moved back up, sucking at Rio’s clit before starting the process over again. She held Rio’s hips steady, her grip on them the only thing keeping Rio from bucking into her face and breaking her nose, and the restraint only made Rio more turned on.</p><p>“Fuck, baby, I’m close,” Rio whimpered. She could feel herself clenching around nothing as the coil in her belly wound tighter and tighter. “Make me come, Agatha. Please, make me—”</p><p>Agatha took Rio’s clit in her mouth and sucked, hard, while also flicking her tongue against the tip. Then she carefully grazed the pulsing flesh with her teeth.</p><p>Rio came with a shout, her body convulsing as waves of pleasure rocked her from the point where Agatha’s mouth was on her. She let go of the railing and grabbed at Agatha’s head with both hands, pressing her firmer against her cunt as her entire body curled around her, chasing the euphoric sensations as long as possible. When her orgasm finally wound down, Rio slumped back against the stairs, body limp as aftershocks made her muscles twitch. Agatha was still between her legs, licking her gently to coax her through, until Rio ran her fingers through her hair.</p><p>“‘S too sensitive,” Rio hissed. But that just made Agatha suck at her clit again. Rio yelped and her entire body arched off the stairs before she pulled roughly at Agatha’s hair, forcing her away from her sex. Agatha looked up at her with a self-satisfied smirk as Rio’s chest heaved. “Evil.”</p><p>“Mmm, maybe a little bit,” Agatha purred, kissing the inside of Rio’s thigh once more before moving to crawl over her. Her face was still shiny with Rio’s cum, and when Agatha kissed her, Rio could taste herself on her lips. Agatha pulled away with an impish grin. “Do you think your legs work well enough to make it to the bedroom?”</p><p>Rio groaned, head falling back against the step behind her with a soft thud. “I think I can manage. If you can keep your hands to yourself.”</p><p>“No promises,” Agatha teased, carefully pushing herself up and standing. She helped Rio to stand, and sure enough her legs were as unsteady as a newborn giraffe. Still, they somehow made it up the stairs, past the door to the guest room, and into Agatha’s bedroom. Once they were there, Agatha flipped on a bedside lamp and turned down the covers, and then she sat on the edge of the bed and quickly kicked her heels off into the corner.</p><p>“Unzip me?” Rio asked, turning her back toward Agatha. She could’ve easily reached the low zipper herself, but there was something irresistibly sexy about having Agatha do it for her. Agatha made quick work of it, and as Rio turned she shrugged the straps off her shoulders and let the dress fall to the floor, leaving her completely naked. Agatha stared at her, eyes dark and hungry as they roamed over her body from head to toe. And then…</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>She tried to cover it by clearing her throat, but Rio heard it. She was standing in front of Agatha, completely naked, for the first time, after the woman had just eaten her out on the goddamn stairs, and she was fucking <em> laughing </em>at her.</p><p>“Rio—”</p><p>“What the fuck?”</p><p>“No, baby, c’mere!” Agatha beckoned, grabbing Rio by the hands and pulling her in closer. “I’m sorry, I just had a thought.”</p><p>“What on earth could you be thinking that made you laugh while I’m standing naked in front of you?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Just how stupid I am,” Agatha admitted, her thumbs rubbing the backs of Rio’s hands. “How absolutely insane I’ve been for not doing this sooner.”</p><p>All of Rio’s offense melted. “Oh.”</p><p>“I’m sorry that I laughed,” Agatha said earnestly. “You’re perfect.”</p><p>Rio looked down shyly. “‘M not perfect.”</p><p>“Oh, I disagree,” Agatha argued, tugging at Rio’s hands until she was sitting astride her lap. “You’re absolutely perfect.” She kissed the tips of Rio’s breasts, one and then the other, and then raised her head to press a quick kiss, just a peck, on Rio’s lips. “For me.”</p><p>Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha’s shoulders and pulled her in for a deeper kiss, open mouthed and breathless as her hands shoved the blazer off her shoulders. Once it was gone, Rio bent to kiss along Agatha’s jaw, but she couldn’t go much further in this position.</p><p>“Lie back, sweetheart,” she coaxed, moving to the side. Agatha scooted up the bed until her head was on the pillows, and Rio crawled over her. Agatha’s hair was splayed out in a dark fan across the sheets, and beneath the silk of the camisole, Rio could see the outline of her nipples hard against the fabric. She wanted to put her mouth on them, but first…</p><p>“Have you been going braless to drive me insane?” Rio asked, teasing her finger over the tip of Agatha’s nipple.</p><p>Agatha shuddered at the barely-there touch, but then she smirked. “Why? Did it work?”</p><p>“Evil,” Rio muttered again, before dropping her face and engulfing Agatha’s breast in her mouth, silk and all. Agatha moaned as Rio’s spit drenched the fabric and her tongue licked at the hardened peak through the wet silk. Agatha’s breasts were, to Rio’s utter delight, extremely sensitive. As she switched her attention back and forth between each side, Agatha’s hips began bucking with more and more insistence.</p><p>Rio pulled away from her chest. “Need something, sweetheart?”</p><p>“Off, off!” Agatha demanded, reaching down to unfasten her pants. Rio swatted her hands away to do it herself, and then Agatha lifted her hips off the bed so that Rio could pull them down her legs. They landed on the floor, somewhere in the vicinity of Agatha’s blazer, and Rio turned back to Agatha.</p><p>She had questions.</p><p>“Agatha?” she said, slowly tracing her fingers from the woman’s knee up her thigh.</p><p>“Mmhmm?” Agatha hummed in response, trying and failing not to squirm under Rio’s touch.</p><p>“Do you always go to work in matching lingerie and no bra? Or was that just because tonight was a special occasion? Who were you planning on fucking tonight?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to answer, but her words were cut off by a gasp as Rio’s fingers finally came to the apex of her thighs and danced over the white lace that barely covered her sex.</p><p>“What was that?” Rio asked, fingertips teasing at the sides of the lace. She could feel how wet Agatha was through the material, and it took every bit of self-control Rio possessed to not rip it off completely.</p><p>“I didn’t think it would be you,” Agatha answered honestly, her voice breathy. “But I wanted it to be.”</p><p>Rio pressed her fingers firmly against the lace, pushing it into the dripping folds of Agatha’s pussy. Agatha moaned, one hand fisting in the sheets as the other came up to her mouth, muffling her sounds.</p><p>“No, baby, let me hear you,” Rio ordered, circling Agatha’s clit through the lace. “There’s no one else here, you can let go.”</p><p>“Fuuuuuuck!” Agatha shouted, yanking her hand free from her mouth and instead clasping her own breast through wet silk.</p><p>“That’s better,” Rio grinned, continuing her slow circles. Below her, Agatha’s hips bucked, seeking firmer contact, but Rio kept her pace, slowly pushing Agatha closer to madness.</p><p>“What the fuck?” Agatha hissed finally.</p><p>“Something wrong, baby?” Rio asked.</p><p>“And you call me evil,” Agatha husked. “Rio, if you don’t stop pussyfooting around and fuck me like you mean it—”</p><p>“This is what you get for teasing me for <em> weeks </em>,” Rio replied. “And for laughing at me.”</p><p>“Motherfu—” But before she could finish her curse, Rio kissed her. She tugged at the bottom of Agatha’s camisole and the woman beneath her moved so that she could rip it over her head. Next, Rio peeled the soaked lace panties down Agatha’s legs.</p><p>“Dios mio,” Rio muttered, staring at the goddess below her as she moved to lie over her. “Agatha, you’re— holy fuck, baby.”</p><p>“Fuck me,” Agatha demanded, pulling Rio close and pressing her hand back down to the apex of her thighs. “Please, Rio, fuck—”</p><p>“I know, baby,” Rio rasped, fingers searching through Agatha’s folds until she found her entrance.</p><p>The sound Agatha made as Rio pressed inside of her with two fingers made Rio feel like a god, like the most powerful entity in the cosmos. As Rio began pumping into her, Agatha’s hips rolled in tandem, meeting each thrust with a shudder and a cry. When Rio hooked her fingers up and began thrusting into her g-spot, she thought Agatha might come off the bed entirely. She moved over Agatha, covering her body with her own, so that they were skin-to-skin, and Agatha wrapped her arms around her shoulders, digging her nails into Rio’s back.</p><p>“More!” Agatha sobbed into Rio’s ear, her voice ragged and desperate, and on the next thrust Rio added another finger. She could feel Agatha’s pussy stretch to accommodate her, and the sensation had both of them moaning with pleasure. “Don’t stop. Don’t you dare fucking stop!”</p><p>Rio wouldn’t dream of it. Instead she angled her palm so that it rubbed against Agatha’s clit and pressed her hips against the back of her hand. It added force to her thrusts, and if she angled herself just right, she could grind against her own knuckles.</p><p>Rio must have made some sort of sound, because Agatha’s eyes flew open. She looked down their bodies, to where Rio was thrusting into her, and let out a shuddering moan.</p><p>“Fuck, are you getting yourself off right now?” she asked.</p><p>“Can’t… help it,” Rio ground out, her own orgasm approaching faster than she anticipated. “You look so good, feel so good, stretched out around me.”</p><p>Agatha shuddered. “Say it again.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed. “You’re so good, baby, taking me so well. God, you’re such a good girl, so—”</p><p>Rio’s words were drowned out by Agatha’s cry as she came. Her back snapped off the bed and her legs snapped shut around Rio’s hips, making it impossible for her to move. Her nails dug into Rio’s shoulders as body shook. Rio felt a rush of wetness on her hand, all the way to her wrist, and then Agatha went limp against the mattress.</p><p>Rio slowly pulled her fingers free from Agatha’s still-twitching cunt, drawing a low moan from the woman beneath her. She stared at the glistening digits in awe for a moment, then sucked them into her mouth.</p><p>Yep, just as delicious as she remembered.</p><p>“Rio, what are you— OH!” Agatha exclaimed as Rio moved between her parted legs and began lapping at the wetness there. “Rio!”</p><p>Rio was too busy tasting every inch of Agatha’s pussy to respond. Agatha’s second orgasm came faster than the first, as Rio sucked her still-sensitive clit into her mouth. Her third was slower, but just as powerful, as she grinded against Rio’s tongue while her fingers curled against her g-spot, making her squirt all over Rio’s chin and chest.</p><p>Rio thought they were done, after that, when Agatha disappeared into the bathroom for a towel. She hadn’t come again, but it didn’t matter to her. She wasn’t the kind of woman to keep score. Still, her own arousal simmered just beneath the surface, so while Agatha was cleaning herself up, Rio’s hand dipped between her legs to take care of things herself.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes slammed open and she looked up to see Agatha standing beside the bed, completely naked, looking down at her. Rio’s hand was between her legs, her fingers just beside her clit, and she blinked up at Agatha owlishly.</p><p>“Um, just, you know… Finishing?” Rio supplied dumbly.</p><p>“Oh, sweetheart, did you think we were done?” Agatha asked, reaching to open the bottom drawer of her nightstand. She pulled out a leather harness with a dark blue strap already threaded through the ring. Rio’s eyes widened as Agatha dangled the harness by one finger. “Is this okay?”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard. “Yes. Yes, very okay.”</p><p>Agatha stepped into the harness, her eyes never leaving Rio’s as she began tightening the straps and fastening the buckles. “Keep touching your clit, but don’t come.”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am,” Rio shuddered, doing exactly as she instructed. Suddenly a thought occurred to Rio, and she laughed.</p><p>“What’s so funny?” Agatha asked, climbing onto the bed. The dark blue strap bobbed between Agatha’s legs as she came closer.</p><p>“I’m just surprised it isn’t purple,” she said as Agatha crawled between her legs.</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Oh, I have a purple one,” she said as she rubbed the end of the cock between Rio’s folds, smearing her wetness all over the silicone before lining it up with Rio’s entrance. “But we’ll have to work up to that one.”</p><p>With one gentle thrust, Agatha slid half of the shaft inside Rio’s wet heat. She was so wet, so ridiculously turned on, that there was hardly any resistance, just the delicious stretch as the blunt tip parted her flesh. Rio groaned, arching up into Agatha as her body adjusted.</p><p>“You okay?” Agatha asked, pressing a kiss to the corner of Rio’s lips.</p><p>“Yeah, just… it’s been a while,” Rio admitted shyly.</p><p>“I’ll go slow, yeah?” Agatha murmured, reaching up and stroking the hair out of Rio’s face. Rio nodded.</p><p>And god, Agatha wasn’t kidding when she promised slow. Every thrust was gently, rocking out and then entering again at a glacial pace, until finally their hips were flush. Agatha stayed like that for a moment, letting Rio adjust again, and kissing her soundly before her hips started to move. Again, she was slow, at first, and at the end of each stroke Rio’s clit grinded against the front of Agatha’s harness.</p><p>“Faster,” Rio begged, finally. “You can go faster. And harder. Anything, really, just make me come.”</p><p>Agatha took a shuddering breath and rocked back onto her heels. Rio keened as the strap slid out of her for a moment, but Agatha shushed her. She grabbed one of the pillows and gestured for Rio to raise her hips so she could slide the pillow under them for a better angle. Then she pushed one of Rio’s legs up, so that her thigh was almost against her chest, and forced Rio to hold it in place.</p><p>She held tight onto Rio’s hips as she lined the strap up with her entrance. “Hold on, baby.”</p><p>With one snap of her hips, Agatha buried her cock to the hilt. Rio let out a pleasured shout, but Agatha didn’t pause. She started a brutal pace, her hips slamming into Rio’s, the strap pistoning in and out of her clenching hole. Her fingers dug into Rio’s hips, pulling her into each thrust, filling her that much harder.</p><p>Rio’s mouth fell open as a string of pornographic moans filled the room. Agatha felt so good driving into her, each thrust hitting that singular spot inside her that wound her closer and closer to orgasm.</p><p>Rio untangled her spare hand, the one not holding her leg to her chest, from the sheets and moved it down her body to her clit. She had barely circled it twice when Agatha grabbed her and pinned her wrist down to the mattress.</p><p>“Don’t touch what’s mine,” Agatha growled, her face strained with exertion. Her hair was wild around her shoulders, strands sticking to her sweat-dampened skin. Her face was flushed, but her eyes— her eyes were neon blue, practically glowing in the lamp light, and she looked down at Rio like she was staking a claim.</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio whined, hips rolling. She could feel her orgasm building steadily as the strap hit her g-spot, but each thrust made the throbbing in her untouched clit even more distracting.</p><p>“You’re mine, baby, and I’ll tell you when to come,” Agatha told her, picking up her pace even more than Rio thought possible.</p><p>Suddenly each stroke made Rio feel like she needed to pee, and she clenched down trying to fight the sensation. “Agatha…”</p><p>“Who do you belong to?” Agatha demanded, moving her hand down to press against Rio’s lower stomach, making the full sensation worse.</p><p>“Baby…” Rio crooned, fighting her body.</p><p>“Tell me who you belong to and I’ll let you come,” Agatha promised.</p><p>Rio couldn’t fight it anymore. “YOU! Fuck, I belong to you! Please let me come, please please <em> please!” </em></p><p>Agatha circled Rio’s clit, once, twice, and then she pressed down hard just as she slammed into Rio’s cunt with the strap, and Rio felt as if something snapped inside her.</p><p>The orgasm that rolled through her body was unlike anything Rio had felt before. It hit like two orgasms in one, one from her clit and one from her g-spot, and both were explosive in their impact. The pleasure rolled through Rio’s body in waves, and just when she felt like she was coming up for air, another wave would hit her, brought on by Agatha’s hips still thrusting and her fingers still moving over her clit.</p><p>“Oh fuck. Oh, Agatha, what— oh fuck!” Rio’s voice climbed as the pleasure continued. She wasn’t sure if this was still the same orgasm, or if she was coming again and again, with each one crashing in on the other. Her body kept spasming, her legs shaking, until finally Rio came back to earth. Even as it ended, it didn’t stop completely, but ebbed away like a receding tide, the aftershocks slowing until Rio was a trembling mess on the bed.</p><p>Rio was aware, after a moment, that the pillow under her hips and the sheets beneath that, were soaked. She tried to prop herself up on her elbows to look down at the mess, but her muscles were still too shaky. Instead she looked up at Agatha, still half inside of her, eyes fixed on Rio with a mixture of awe and desire and something far more tender than Rio expected after what had just happened.</p><p>“I think you broke me,” Rio said, her voice raspy.</p><p>Agatha smiled and looked back down at where they were joined. Slowly and carefully she pulled the rest of the way out of Rio, who winced at the sensation. She quickly removed the harness and tossed it and the strap aside before moving to lie on the opposite side of the bed.</p><p>Rio turned her head to look at Agatha, so far away on the king-size mattress, but then she reached for her.</p><p>“C’mere,” Agatha beckoned, holding her hand out across the mattress.</p><p>Rio groaned. Her muscles protested as she rolled toward Agatha and dragged her body across the bed.</p><p>“I hate to force you to move, but I didn’t think you’d want to sleep in a wet spot,” Agatha whispered as Rio slipped into her arms.</p><p>“Good thinking,” Rio said with a yawn.</p><p>Agatha turned the lamp off and pulled the covers up over their bare bodies, then looked at Rio with a frown. “Turn over.”</p><p>Rio didn’t have the energy to argue, so with another groan she turned, putting her back toward Agatha. “So bossy.”</p><p>“And you love it,” Agatha whispered as she moved to lie against Rio’s back. Rio hummed sleepily, then giggled as Agatha’s fingertips tickled her ribs before settling. Agatha wrapped her arm around Rio’s waist, twining their fingers together just below Rio’s breasts. It was the kind of embrace that made Rio feel small, and safe, and cared for.</p><p>“Goodnight, Agatha,” Rio mumbled, closing her eyes.</p><p>Agatha pressed a soft kiss to the back of her neck. “Goodnight, my love.”</p>

<p>Rio awoke to an empty bed, the smell of bacon, and the sound of music playing.</p><p>She rolled over and her body immediately protested the movement. Rio wasn’t a virgin, far from it, but her muscles ached in places she couldn’t remember ever acching before. It shouldn’t be surprising really: a few hours after they had fallen asleep for the first time, Rio had woken up to use the bathroom, and when she returned Agatha was also awake and they had made love again— and again, and again— until Agatha fell asleep lying half on top of Rio, head resting on her chest.</p><p>And yes, Rio was calling it making love. She had always thought that term was cheesy and oversentimental. But she had never had sex that felt like what she had Agatha did last night, had never felt this way for anyone else before Agatha. It had her all sappy and soft, and for once she wasn’t fighting it. What she had done wasn’t just sex, it wasn’t just fucking it was… more.</p><p>Agatha’s softly spoken my love still rang in Rio’s ears. Rio was aware that it wasn’t an I love you, and frankly she was okay with that. It was too early, and their relationship was too tentative. But it was something. It was something on top of a whole night of somethings.</p><p>Rio forced herself out of bed and looked around the room. Agatha’s suit and her dress were hanging on a hook on Agatha’s closet door, and their jewelry was laid out on one end of the dresser. Beside the jewelry was the otter plushy that Rio had given Agatha for Christmas, and beside that was an unfamiliar t-shirt. Rio stepped closer and unfolded the soft gray fabric to see a cracked blue Columbia University logo across the front.</p><p>Agatha had left one of her college t-shirts out for her. Add that to the list of somethings.</p><p>Once Rio had washed up and gotten dressed in the t-shirt and a pair of boxers, she made her way downstairs. As she made her way down, she could feel a blush spreading across her cheeks. She wasn’t sure if she would ever look at those stairs the same way again. She padded slowly to the kitchen and leaned against the side of the doorway, taking in the view.</p><p>The sight of Agatha Harkness standing in her kitchen wearing nothing but a floral robe, her dark hair loose and messy in a way it only is after sex, was something Rio wanted to see every morning for the rest of her life. A Taylor Swift song was playing from Agatha’s phone, and her hips swayed to the beat as she cracked eggs into a bowl to begin making French toast. Rio grinned as she watched, completely enchanted, as Agatha danced her way over to the fridge to retrieve the milk, still completely oblivious to her audience, until she turned back around and gasped as she caught Rio staring.</p><p>“Motherfucker!” Agatha exclaimed as Rio laughed at her surprise. “Put a bell on, for fuck’s sake. I didn’t realize you were awake yet.”</p><p>“I woke up and the bed was empty,” Rio said, stepping further into the kitchen to wrap her arms around Agatha’s waist. “I didn’t like it.”</p><p>“Well, I promised someone French toast,” Agatha pointed out. She looked down at Rio’s torso. “You look good in my clothes.”</p><p>“You look good… out of your clothes,” Rio said lamely.</p><p>Agatha burst into laughter. “That was so cheesy.”</p><p>“Can’t help it, my brain is still all mushy from last night,” Rio huffed. “And this morning…”</p><p>Agatha giggled, and Rio decided the best way to stop her teasing was with a kiss. Morning-Agatha was soft and pliant, all sighs and quiet moans against Rio’s lips. Rio kept her kiss gentle and slow, savoring the moment rather than leading to anything else. Finally, their lips parted, but Rio didn’t release Agatha from her arms.</p><p>“If you want food, you have to let me go,” Agatha told her, but rather than try to pull away she nuzzled her nose against Rio’s.</p><p>“Don’t wanna,” Rio murmured, but the words had no sooner left her mouth when her stomach rumbled loudly.</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Tell that to your stomach, hot stuff.” She pressed one last kiss to the corner of Rio’s mouth before stepping away. “I’ll finish breakfast while you make the coffee, okay?”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio grumbled, shuffling toward the coffee maker. She was halfway through stirring the coffee grounds when she realized something. “Why do I always make the coffee?”</p><p>“Hmm?” Agatha hummed as she dunked thick slices of bread into the custard she had prepared.</p><p>“Why do I always make the coffee now?” Rio asked, a bit louder. “I just realized, I always make the coffee in the mornings now. Ever since you showed me how to work this ridiculous espresso machine, you always ask me to do it.”</p><p>“Oh, I hadn’t realized,” Agatha said, and Rio could tell by her flippant tone that it was a lie.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha sighed dramatically. “It’s because you make it better.”</p><p>“What?” Rio was genuinely dumbfounded. She made their coffees the same way Agatha had shown her when she first moved in.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha huffed. “I’ve tried making it myself and it’s just not as good. You add just the right amount of vanilla and you do the thing with the foam and the caramel drizzle and it’s just… It’s really good when you do it, okay?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Okay, baby. I don’t mind making you coffee, especially if you like it that much.”</p><p>“Really?” Agatha asked, seeming surprised.</p><p>“Really,” Rio assured her.</p><p>They finished preparing breakfast and moved to sit diagonally across the corner of the kitchen island, half facing one another. Agatha sipped her coffee with a contented hum as Rio began cutting her French toast.</p><p>“Have you heard from Nicky?” she asked.</p><p>“No, but Wanda texted me,” Agatha replied. “Apparently the boys snuck their video game consoles into the bedroom after she and Nat went to bed. So they had a late night and she decided to let them sleep in. She and Nat are taking the boys to some kind of indoor playground after lunch, and I told her we would meet them there.”</p><p>Rio nodded, chewing her food. It was just as delicious as she remembered.</p><p>Mentioning Nicky had apparently sparked something in Agatha’s brain. She put down her mug and knit her fingers together anxiously. “I’ve been thinking.”</p><p>“Oh-kay.” Rio felt a knot begin forming in her stomach.</p><p>“I don’t want you to take this the wrong way...”</p><p>Rio froze with her mug halfway to her mouth. So this was it. Agatha was second guessing this. After one night of sex, she had decided that it wasn’t worth the risk. God, Rio was such an idiot—</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Mmhmm, wh— yeah?” Rio stuttered.</p><p>“Did you even hear what I said?”</p><p>“I— No,” Rio replied, chagrined. “I got lost in my own head for a second.”</p><p>“And let me guess, you jumped to the worst possible conclusion?” Agatha asked knowingly.</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio mumbled. “Do you regret last night?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “What? No… Is that what you think? No, sweetheart, of course not. I— Last night was… Well, it was long overdue, that’s for sure.”</p><p>The corners of Rio’s lips tugged up in a hesitant grin. “Yeah.”</p><p>“It was…” Agatha shook her head. “No, Rio, I don’t regret last night.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, her shoulders relaxing. “Then what were you thinking about?”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her hands before speaking. “I think that perhaps we shouldn’t tell Nicky about… this. Us.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Oh.”</p><p>“It’s just… There’s so much happening right now with the transplant on Monday and the recovery,” Agatha continued. “Plus this is so new and I don’t want him to get his hopes up or be confused or—”</p><p>“No, you’re right,” Rio agreed, nodding.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. “Really? You’re not upset?”</p><p>“No, sweetheart,” Rio assured her. “I agree with everything you’re saying. There’s a lot going on right now. And our relationship is new. Keeping it between us for now is for the best.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha nodded. Her relief was easily read in the way her shoulders relaxed and the fine lines in her face disappeared. She looked down at her plate, a soft pink hue taking up residence on her cheeks. “I’ve never done this with him, you know.”</p><p>“Done what?” Rio asked, confused.</p><p>“I’ve never introduced him to a girlfriend.” Agatha said it nonchalantly, as she popped a piece of bacon into her mouth.</p><p>A smile spread across Rio’s face as her chest buzzed with happiness. “Is that what I am? Your girlfriend?”</p><p>Agatha chewed slowly, her expression thoughtful. “If you want to be.”</p><p>Rio fought the urge to roll her eyes. “Yes, Agatha, I want to be your girlfriend.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply, as if somehow Rio’s answer still surprised her after last night. God, Rio thought, they really were a pair of idiots. She assumed the worst in any given situation. And Agatha was so unaccustomed to affection that she didn’t see how absolutely head over heels Rio was for her. They were perfect for each other.</p><p>“For what it’s worth, I think that he’ll take it well, when we do eventually tell him,” Rio told her.</p><p>“Oh yeah?” Agatha smiled.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio grinned. “When you were out of town for the weekend and it was just the two of us, he told me that you and I should just get married.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t appear surprised by that. “He’s mentioned something similar to me as well.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio asked, surprised.</p><p>“Mmhmm,” Agatha hummed, stabbing at a piece of toast.</p><p>Rio wanted to ask Agatha how she felt about that. Agatha might not even be interested in remarrying, considering how terrible her first wife was. And Rio…</p><p>Fuck, she was already thinking of marrying this woman. Talk about a lesbian stereotype.</p><p>“It’s way too soon to talk about marriage anyway,” Rio said flippantly, waving her last piece of bacon in the air.</p><p>“Yes, definitely,” Agatha agreed.</p><p>“I mean, you haven’t even taken me on a proper first date yet,” Rio continued.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flashed at her teasing. “You don’t consider a night at the opera a date?”</p><p>“Not when we have to deal with both of our exes, no,” Rio grumbled.</p><p>“Fair,” Agatha conceded. “So what are we doing for our first date?”</p><p>“None of your scripted date bullshit,” Rio replied, pointing at Agatha with her fork. “If you take me out for French or Japanese, I’m going home.”</p><p>“Noted,” Agatha nodded, her grin widening. “Is that ban for all future dates or just the first date?”</p><p>Rio’s chest warmed at the thought of multiple future dates. “Just the first one.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, watching closely as Rio finished her last bite of French toast. Rio opened her mouth to ask what she was staring at, but before she could speak Agatha’s hand was on her face. Rio’s breath caught in her throat as Agatha dragged her thumb over her bottom lip, wiping away any syrupy residue. Agatha’s own lips were parted, and her tongue darted along her bottom lip as she did so. When she seemed satisfied, she pulled her hand back and brought it to her own lips, sucking the syrup from the pad of her thumb.</p><p>Rio’s brain short-circuited. That was the only explanation, because Agatha was already up and putting their plates in the dishwasher by the time she was able to formulate a coherent thought.</p><p>“What time are we meeting Wanda and Nat and the boys?” she asked.</p><p>“We’ll need to leave around two. Why?” Agatha asked, wiping her hands and making her way back around the island toward Rio.</p><p>Rio glanced at the clock over the stove and did a mental calculation. “So what I’m hearing is: we have time.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow as Rio wrapped her arms around her waist. “Time for what?”</p><p>Rio bent her knees and lifted Agatha onto the counter. “Dessert.”</p><p>“You’re insatiable,” Agatha teased, but her words were cut off by a groan as Rio trailed sucking kisses down the side of her neck.</p><p>“I just figure…” Rio began, punctuating her words with a kiss to Agatha’s collarbone while her fingers made quick work of the tie on her robe. “With the transplant on Monday and everything…” She sucked Agatha’s nipple into her mouth as the other woman arched her back. “We probably won’t… get any alone time… for quite a while.” Agatha laid back on the marble countertop, and her silk robe fell open around her. Rio’s kisses trailed lower and lower, over the smooth, soft plane of her belly until she nuzzled the neatly-trimmed hair between her legs. “So I think…” Rio used her thumbs to spread Agatha’s folds apart. “We should take advantage…” Rio blew cold air over Agatha’s clit, making her shiver. “Of the time we have today. Don’t you?”</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, Rio licked a wet stripe through her sex and lapped at her clit, until the only sound she could make was a ragged moan.</p><p>After one night— well, two, if you counted the night they met— Rio was certain that she would never get tired of this, tired of Agatha. The taste of her, the sounds she made, the way her body moved and arched as Rio fucked her with her tongue and lapped at her clit… Rio was gone, absolutely lost to this woman. One of Agatha’s heels dug against her shoulder as her hips bucked up into her mouth until Rio had to wrap an arm around Agatha’s leg to hold her down. She was just so goddamn responsive.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio, I need—” Agatha’s words faded as Rio sucked at her clit, replaced by a sob as her hips struggled against Rio’s hold. She tugged insistently at Rio’s hair, until finally Rio released her clit with one last lick.</p><p>“What do you need, baby?” Rio asked before lazily lapping at her again.</p><p>“Fuck!” Agatha grunted. “Inside! I need you inside.”</p><p>Rio didn’t need to be told twice. She pressed into Agatha with one finger, thrusting easily through her slick flesh a few times before adding a second. Agatha’s clit throbbed against her tongue, and Rio went back to lapping at the sensitive bud as she began picking up a rhythm with her fingers, matching each swipe of her tongue to the thrusts in and out of Agatha’s body. With each motion, Agatha’s moans and cries grew more strained, and her cunt clenched tighter, like it was trying to drag Rio back inside.</p><p>“Oh, god, Rio—”</p><p>Agatha’s body began bowing off the marble and her walls fluttered around Rio’s fingers. Rio knew that she was close, and the thought sent a bolt of pleasure to her own clit, but she focused on Agatha’s pleasure. She curled her fingers, pressing deep into the front wall of Agatha’s pussy, as she sucked hard at Agatha’s clit.</p><p>“You feel s— so good— so—” Agatha’s praise melted into a series of gasping whines that rose in pitch as her pussy clenched down tight on Rio’s fingers and her clit throbbed between Rio’s lips. Her soft thighs tensed around Rio’s head and her hips bucked with pleasure as her orgasm washed through her. All the while, Rio continued softly licking at her clit and moving her fingers until finally Agatha pushed her away with a groan.</p><p>As she kissed the soft inside of Agatha’s thighs, Rio was reminded of their first time together. How drawn to Agatha she had felt from the very first moment she saw her. She couldn’t help but wonder if, in some cosmic way, they were meant to end up like this.</p><p>“You’re not allowed to think that deeply after eating me out,” Agatha said, pulling Rio out of her thoughts and back to the present. She had propped herself up on her elbows and was looking at Rio with a mix of affection and curiosity.</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio mumbled, placing one more kiss on Agatha’s thigh before straightening up. She took Agatha’s hand to help her sit up, and when Agatha pulled her into an embrace she went willingly, stepping between the other woman’s legs.</p><p>“What’s on your mind?” Agatha asked, kissing her softly.</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio replied. When Agatha looked at her skeptically, she sighed. “Just thinking about the night we met.”</p><p>“Hmm,” Agatha hummed fondly. “I can see the connection. And I seem to remember getting you off in a restroom that night.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “That you did.”</p><p>“You know,” Agatha said, trailing her fingers over Rio’s jaw, where the skin was still damp from eating her out, “there’s a perfectly good bathroom upstairs. And we both need a shower before we go out.”</p><p>Rio’s grin widened. “What are you suggesting?”</p><p>“Perhaps a little reenactment,” Agatha shrugged. “With some improvisation, of course.”</p><p>She pushed Rio away and gently lowered herself down off of the counter, pulling her robe closed around her body, much to Rio’s disappointment. Then she stepped away, heading toward the stairs. When she realized Rio wasn’t following, she turned back to her and beckoned with one finger.</p><p>“Come, pet.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t about to turn down an invitation like that.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As soon as they arrived at the location Wanda had texted Agatha, Rio knew that there had been a miscommunication. The “indoor playground” was actually an indoor trampoline park with jump pads, foam pits, and obstacle courses, all in various neon shades. They were barely inside the door when they were bombarded with the smell of sweaty feet mixed with bad pizza and the sound of children screaming. Rio was instantly overstimulated, and beside her Agatha instantly tensed.</p><p>“Sweetheart?” Rio said, only for Agatha to shush her.</p><p>“Not here,” she hissed, her eyes scanning the large room.</p><p>They found Wanda in a small seating area to one side of the play area, sipping a very large soda from a styrofoam cup. Natasha and the boys were a few feet away, removing their shoes and placing them in nearby cubbies. As soon as he saw them, Nicky came running, one shoe on and one shoe off, hugging Agatha so tightly that she let out a soft oomf.</p><p>“Mama! Rio!” he shouted, releasing Agatha just as quickly as he had hugged her to grab Rio around the waist.</p><p>“Hey, mijo,” Rio chuckled, running her hand through his short hair. “Did you have a good time at your sleepover?”</p><p>“Yeah!” he grinned toothily. “Will you go on the obstacle course with me, Rio? Please?”</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha, and she knew that panic was simmering just beneath the tense smile she had pasted on her face.</p><p>“You go take your other shoe off, and we’ll be over in just a minute, okay?” Rio told him. Nicky nodded and sped away, and Rio turned back to her girlfriend. “Agatha—”</p><p>“Absolutely not,” Agatha said, her voice low. Her eyes scanned the trampolines and foam pits, clearly imagining everything that could go wrong. “I can’t believe Wanda even suggested this. What if he falls? What if he bumps into another kid? What if—?”</p><p>“Do you trust me?” Rio asked, taking her hand and squeezing it.</p><p>Agatha looked at her abruptly. “What?”</p><p>“Do you trust me?” Rio repeated, slowly emphasizing every word.</p><p>“Yes, of course,” Agatha replied. “But Rio—”</p><p>“Do you trust me with him?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened and closed as she looked from Rio to the trampolines to where Nicky sat laughing with his friends. Finally she sighed. “You know I do.”</p><p>“Then trust me to watch out for him,” Rio told her. “I’ll stick to him like glue, Agatha, I promise. I won’t let him get hurt.” She squeezed Agatha’s hand again. “I know how much this stresses you out. But if we make him leave, he’s going to have a meltdown. Let him stay and burn off some energy and have fun before his surgery. I’ll keep him safe.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression softened as she looked down at their joined hands. She squeezed Rio’s hand back before looking back up.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>It was one word, but Rio felt the weight of it in her soul. She wanted to kiss Agatha so badly at that moment, but she settled for one more gentle squeeze before she let her hand go and they made their way over to where Wanda was sitting. Natasha had already taken the boys to the closest trampoline and they were adjusting to the movement beneath their feet.</p><p>“Hey, how was your ni—” Wanda’s voice trailed off as she looked between the two of them, her green eyes wide. Rio could practically see the gears turning in her mind as she studied them. “Oh. Oh! Oh my god! You guys finally—”</p><p>“Wanda,” Agatha hissed warningly as she unbuttoned her coat.</p><p>“It’s about time,” Wanda said, ignoring her. She eyed the black turtleneck Rio was wearing, the one she had taken from Agatha’s closet because none of her shirts would cover the hickies Agatha had left on her neck. “Did you have to go full vampire on her, Aggie?”</p><p>“Riooooo!” Nicky shouted from the trampoline. He was standing on a landing about to jump. “Watch this!”</p><p>“I think that’s my cue,” Rio said, kicking off her sneakers. “I’ll, uh, leave you two to it.”</p><p>She made her way over to where Natasha and the boys were, her legs wobbling a bit as she hopped her way across a path of trampolines. She had barely joined them when Nicky launched himself off the landing with a squeal, bounced off a trampoline, and landed in a pile of foam cubes. He came back up giggling, completely unaware of the panic attack Rio felt certain Agatha was having.</p><p>“Nice jump, mijo,” Rio praised, pulling him out of the pit so Billy could take a turn.</p><p>“Hey, Nicky, I bet I can finish the obstacle course before you!” Tommy shouted as he bounced on a nearby trampoline, kicking his feet out with each jump.</p><p>“You’re on!” Nicky replied, tugging Rio along as he followed him.</p><p>Rio expected a simple obstacle course, but what she found reminded her of something off Ninja Warrior. Tommy and Nicky wound their way through like spider monkeys, but halfway through Rio found herself struggling. Doing this the day after a night of strenuous physical activity might not have been her best idea. She made it through, but by the end her muscles were protesting. Still, she wasn’t about to give in.</p><p>“Rio, there’s basketball goals! C’mon!” Nicky shouted, completely ignorant of the way Rio’s muscles strained.</p><p>“Coming, mijo,” she replied from where she was lying face-down in a pile of foam.</p><p>The basketball goals were positioned above large trampolines, allowing the players to bounce to make dunk shots. Natasha stood to one side, watching as the boys took turns, and Rio dragged herself to stand beside the other woman.</p><p>“You okay?” Nat asked, looking her over.</p><p>“Never better,” Rio lied. She watched as Nicky scored a basket without bouncing and clapped. “Good job, mijo!”</p><p>“He’s a good player. It’s too bad that he’ll have to miss the regular season,” Nat commented.</p><p>“Do you coach the basketball team, too?” Rio asked.</p><p>“No, but as the PE teacher, I coordinate it,” Nat replied.</p><p>“I didn’t realize…”</p><p>Nat shrugged. “It didn’t come up.”</p><p>They watched as the boys played for another minute before Nat spoke again. “How are you with baseball?”</p><p>“I played softball through high school. Why?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Because the guy we had lined up to coach the baseball team for the nine and ten year olds just took a job in Chicago, so his family’s moving,” Nat replied. “Wanda said Nicky might be recovered in time for baseball season, and I don’t know what your schedule looks like but…”</p><p>“You want me to coach his baseball team?”</p><p>Nat shrugged. “If you’re up to it. No pressure, just something to think about.”</p><p>“Hey, Rio, you try!” Nicky shouted, passing the basketball to her.</p><p>Rio looked from the boys, who were all looking at her with eager faces, to the basketball hoop. “You sure?”</p><p>“Yeah!” they shouted in unison.</p><p>Rio moved around to the other side of the trampoline, making sure the basketball was firmly in her grip. She looked from the boys to the side, where Agatha was sitting beside Wanda. Agatha had her phone to her ear, but her eyes were on Rio. Rio gave her a wink, and Agatha rolled her eyes, but Rio preened at her girlfriend’s attention. She looked back at the goal, pulled the basketball to her chest, and then took a jump. Her feet hit the trampoline and Rio used its momentum and her knees to launch herself upwards.</p><p>Rio knew before the ball left her hands that she had made a mistake. The motion of launching herself into the air, combined with the unsteady surface of the trampoline beneath her feet, sent pain shooting through her knee. But it wasn’t until she came down and her leg refused to support her weight that she realized exactly how badly she fucked up.</p><p>She landed on the trampoline in a heap, muttering curses under her breath as the pain radiated from her knee. She ground her teeth against the pain as she straightened out her leg and massaged the muscles. Before she could catch her breath she was surrounded by all three boys, and every bounce of the trampoline beneath them sent pain shooting through her leg.</p><p>“Rio? Are you okay?” Nicky asked, his brown eyes wide with concern.</p><p>“I’ll be okay, mijo, just hurt my knee a little,” she assured him.</p><p>“Give her some space, boys,” Nat ordered, kneeling down beside her. “You good?”</p><p>“Yeah, just an old injury flaring up,” Rio replied. “Can you help me off these things?”</p><p>Nat nodded and she hauled Rio up to her feet. Rio put her arm around Nat’s shoulder and the redhead practically carried her to the steps off of the jump surface. As soon as they were on solid ground, Agatha was in her face.</p><p>“Are you okay?” she asked, hands on Rio’s face.</p><p>“I’m fine, it’s my knee,” Rio replied.</p><p>“I’m calling an ambulance,” Agatha declared, raising her phone to begin dialing.</p><p>“No, Agatha, no,” Rio said with a sigh. “I’m fine, I promise. I know what an ACL tear feels like, and this isn’t that. I just overdid it, that’s all. Please do not call an ambulance.”</p><p>“You need a doctor,” Agatha growled as Natasha set Rio down sideways on one of the benches.</p><p>“No, I just need some ice,” Rio told her. “I’m fine, I promise.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look entirely convinced, but she sat down beside Rio with no more argument. Rio sighed, leaning back against Agatha’s side. Nat got a pack of ice from the concession stand and placed it on Rio’s knee.</p><p>“Is Rio gonna be okay?” Nicky asked, looking at Agatha. Clearly he didn’t believe Rio’s own assessment of her health.</p><p>Agatha sighed and looked back at Rio. “Yes, she’ll be fine. She just forgot that she can’t fly.”</p><p>“She made the shot, though,” Tommy remarked.</p><p>“Did I?” Rio asked, pleasantly surprised. “Cool.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m messaging Clint to come pick us up,” she declared. “Nicky, go jump around a little more, but please be careful. I refuse to take care of more than one injured child this weekend.”</p><p>Nat herded the boys back to the play area and this time Wanda followed, leaving Agatha and Rio alone. Rio cringed as she tried to move her leg.</p><p>“Do you have any ibuprofen in your purse?” she asked.</p><p>“Somewhere,” Agatha replied, digging through the contents. “You know, if you would go to an actual doctor, they might prescribe you something stronger.”</p><p>“I don’t want anything stronger,” Rio told her.</p><p>“Rio, if you’re hurting—” Agatha began.</p><p>“I don’t take narcotics, Agatha,” Rio argued. “So there’s no point in going to a doctor.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand stilled where it was digging through her bag. “So what are you going to take after your surgery?”</p><p>“I’ll take Tylenol,” Rio replied.</p><p>“Tyle— Rio, they’re cutting you open,” Agatha said as if this were new information and Rio was an idiot.</p><p>“It’s laparoscopic,” Rio corrected. “Just a few small incisions.”</p><p>“They’re removing an organ! That’s going to hurt,” Agatha reminded her.</p><p>“I’m aware,” Rio grunted as her leg was jostled. “Still not taking any narcotics.”</p><p>“Rio, be reasonable.”</p><p>“I am being reasonable!” Rio exclaimed. “Agatha, pain is temporary. Pain, I can deal with. But a relapse…” She shuddered at the thought. “I can’t risk it.”</p><p>Agatha was quiet for a long moment. Finally she turned, careful not to jostle Rio anymore than she had to, and held the medicine bottle out toward Rio. “Here. You can have some of my drink to wash them down.” Her eyes followed Rio’s every movement as she counted out the tablets and swallowed them with a sip of Agatha’s lemonade. Rio handed her the bottle back, and Agatha held it tightly in her hands. “I don’t like the idea of you being in pain.”</p><p>Rio sighed and relaxed back against Agatha, her head finding a perfect resting spot against her shoulder. “I know. And if the roles were reversed, I’d be the same way. But I can’t risk it.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha agreed finally.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio made it back to Agatha’s apartment in one piece, leaning on Agatha as Nicky led the way. Agatha promptly deposited her onto the sofa with an ice pack, a pile of pillows, and enough snacks to last a week, before disappearing into her office with her phone in hand. Nicky soon joined Rio, careful not to touch her leg as he curled up on the opposite end of the sofa, and they turned on a nature documentary on Netflix. Rio didn’t think much of Agatha’s disappearance at first— she was a busy woman with an important job— but when the second episode transitioned to the third, Rio started to get concerned.</p><p>Thankfully, after three hours of rest, Rio’s knee was feeling much better. She stood carefully and tested putting her weight on it.</p><p>“Does it hurt?” Nicky asked, watching her with a concerned expression so like Agatha’s that it was uncanny.</p><p>“A little,” Rio replied. “But it’s much better than it was. I’m gonna see what your Mama’s up to, then we can order dinner, okay?”</p><p>“Can we get Chinese?” Nicky asked, his eyes lighting up with excitement.</p><p>“I don’t see why not,” Rio replied, running her fingers through his hair as she hobbled by.</p><p>Agatha’s office was a small room off of the dining room, just large enough for her desk and a small purple sofa. Three walls were covered with framed magazine covers and articles that Agatha had written, some Tarot, others from her time Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar. The wall behind Agatha’s desk was mostly taken up by a large window, and beneath it was a bookshelf that held everything from The Odyssey to Agatha’s collection of trashy romance novels. Three photos sat atop the shelf, slowly fading in the sunlight. One showed Agatha with Jen and Lilia piled on a sofa, wine glasses in hand, cheeks flushed red.  The next was a photo of her and a much younger Nicky, dinosaur backpack in hand, outside his kindergarten classroom on his first day of school. The last was of Agatha in a powder blue graduation gown, her mortarboard in hand, standing between her parents. Hiram Harkness was smiling proudly, and even Evanora was smiling, though it looked as if it pained her to do so.</p><p>The newest additions to Agatha’s office were three of Rio’s leafy dependents. Between moving out of her apartment and reducing her hours at NYU, Rio had been forced to find new homes for many of her plants. A few others had found a home in other areas of the apartment, but three now resided in Agatha’s inner sanctum: A snake plant sat at the end of the sofa, an arrangement of green, pink, and violet succulents was in the center of Agatha’s desk, and a pothos sat on one side of the bookshelf, its long vines draped across the surface and around the framed photographs.</p><p>Agatha was sitting at her desk, her phone to her ear, her laptop on the desk in front of her. She glanced up at Rio and gestured for her to sit on the sofa as she continued her conversation. Rio sat with a huff, sinking into the plush purple velvet.</p><p>“And they’ll all be down by morning?” she said, glancing at her computer screen. “Well, if they’re not, I don’t care what you have to threaten them with, you get them taken down. Alright? Yeah… Yeah, thanks, Jen. Have a good night.”</p><p>Agatha disconnected the phone with a sigh and looked at Rio. “Knee feeling better?”</p><p>“Still twinges a bit, but it’s better,” Rio told her. “What did Jen want? Something about the magazine?”</p><p>Agatha’s brows furrowed with confusion, then her eyes widened. “Oh, um, different Jen. That was my attorney, Jennifer Walters.”</p><p>“Your attorney?”</p><p>Agatha flexed her hands nervously. “I need to show you something.”</p><p>She turned her laptop toward Rio so that she could see the screen. A headline in red flashed across the top of the display: Harkness’s date has an Operatic Meltdown. Below that were two images. The first was of her on Agatha’s arm, walking into the opera house the night before. Rio had been vaguely aware of the photographers, but hadn’t realized that she and Agatha were attention-worthy. Once she saw the second photo, however, Rio realized why they were getting attention. The second photo showed the exact moment Rio had thrown her drink on Agatha’s ex.</p><p>“Shit,” Rio hissed, scrolling down. The article didn’t say much— just stating the obvious, that there had clearly been some sort of altercation culminating in Rio throwing her drink on Daphne, followed by a brief synopsis of Agatha and Daphne’s past. It didn’t even identify Rio by name, just referred to her as “Agatha Harkness’s unidentified date.” But still, there it was, splashed all over a bunch of tawdry gossip pages.</p><p>“I have an alert on my phone to let me know whenever my name is mentioned in a news article,” Agatha explained. “It went off while we were at the trampoline park earlier. I’ve been dealing with it.”</p><p>“So your attorney—?”</p><p>“She’s making sure the articles are taken down. She also reached out to Daphne’s attorney to arrange compensation for her dress,” Agatha told her, standing and rounding the desk so she could sit beside Rio. “It’s going to be alright, Rio.”</p><p>Rio groaned. “I shouldn’t have thrown my drink at her.”</p><p>“Probably not,” Agatha conceded, but a grin tugged at her lips. “But I won’t lie and say I didn’t enjoy seeing Daphne brought down a peg or ten.”</p><p>“Well, she deserved worse,” Rio muttered. “She was being mean to you.”</p><p>“My knight in shining armor,” Agatha declared, reaching out to rub between her shoulder blades. “I’ll take care of it, I promise. I won’t let her hurt you for your association with me.”</p><p>“I didn’t realize there would be photographers watching.”</p><p>“I should have prepared you. I knew Daphne would be a problem, but I didn’t think…” Agatha sighed. “I’m not a celebrity, but my family name and my social position comes with a certain level of scrutiny and media attention. It can be difficult. I understand if that’s not something you want to deal with.”</p><p>Rio cut her eyes at Agatha. “Are you trying to break up with me after being my girlfriend for less than twenty-four hours?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m just giving you an out.”</p><p>“I don’t want an out,” Rio grumbled, reaching for her. “I just want you.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a long moment. Her usual mask was gone, and Rio could practically see the gears turning in Agatha’s mind as she processed her declaration. Finally, Agatha sighed and pressed her forehead against Rio’s.</p><p>“You have me,” she said softly. “Because I want you, too.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio replied, pressing a soft kiss to Agatha’s lips. She meant for it to be quick, but Agatha deepened the kiss, pouring all of the emotions she was feeling into it. For a moment, Rio forgot where they were, forgot that they weren’t alone.</p><p>“Mama? Rio? Are we ordering Chinese?”</p><p>The sound of Nicky’s voice quickly pulled them back to reality. They quickly shuffled apart, retreating to opposite ends of the sofa like two teenagers who were caught making out. Agatha gave Rio a sheepish look before they both burst out laughing.</p><p>“Chinese?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Sounds perfect.”</p><p> </p><p>They ordered Chinese and ate it while piled up on the sofa, breaking Agatha’s rule of no food outside the kitchen so that Rio could keep her knee elevated. Nicky fell asleep halfway through Jurassic World, lying stretched out beside Rio on the sofa while Agatha sat curled up on the opposite end. Rio thought, as she stretched out her good leg to poke Agatha in the hip, that it was exactly how she wanted to spend every night for the rest of her life.</p><p>But then they went to bed, and Rio was reminded that she would be going to sleep in her own bed alone. She changed into her pajamas and Agatha’s college t-shirt, then brushed her teeth, all the while staring at the pristine white comforter on her bed. There was an energy buzzing beneath her skin, combatting the fatigue that weighed down her limbs, a mixture of anxiety and longing that she couldn’t seem to shake off.</p><p>It was pathetic, really, how quickly she had become addicted to Agatha’s presence. And addiction was the only thing Rio could compare this feeling to. The desire to be with Agatha was a physical ache in her chest, as if a tether was pulling her to the other woman in spite of the boundaries they had set that morning.</p><p>The decision to go to Agatha’s room was almost entirely unconscious, with Rio’s feet padding softly down the hall, past Nicky’s room, to where Agatha’s bedroom door stood slightly ajar. She pushed it open, only to find Agatha sitting at her vanity, brushing through her long locks, her back to the door. She wore a black tank top that left most of her back exposed, purple plaid pajama shorts. Rio watched, transfixed, as Agatha pulled her hair over her shoulder to brush though the ends, the muscles of her back flexing beneath the skin. When she pulled her hair to the opposite side, Rio’s eyes were drawn to two small dark circles on her left shoulderblade.</p><p>“I didn’t know you had a tattoo.”</p><p>Agatha nearly jumped out of her skin. “Jesus— A bell. I swear to god, I’m getting you a collar with a little bell to wear like a goddamn cat.”</p><p>“A collar? Kinky,” Rio teased with a grin, stepping closer to get a better look. The circles were barely half an inch in diameter, plain black ink. One circle was empty, while the other was mostly filled in, leaving just a sliver of skin visible in a crescent shape. Rio ran her fingers over the ink and Agatha shivered lightly beneath her touch. “What are they?”</p><p>“Moon phases,” Agatha replied. “They represent me and Nicky, I was born on the night of the full moon and Nicky was born under a—”</p><p>“Crescent moon,” Rio supplied. “I remember. While I was in labor, the nurses kept closing the blinds in my hospital room, and I was yelling at them to open them. I wanted to see the moon. It felt… I don’t know… Grounding? Is that weird?”</p><p>“Not weird,” Agatha declared, turning around to face Rio. “Did you need something?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said, sitting on the edge of the bed. She rolled the edge of Agatha’s blanket between her fingers, the plush floral-print fabric soft in her grasp. Agatha’s room smelled like the woman herself, a soft blending of vanilla and lavender that calmed Rio’s anxiety almost instantly.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Hmm?” Rio hummed, looking up from the blanket.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Agatha asked, her voice soft.</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio replied.</p><p>“We agreed that we wouldn’t tell Nicky until after the surgery,” Agatha pointed out.</p><p>“I know,” Rio replied, trying and failing not to sound whiny.</p><p>“That means we can’t sleep together,” Agatha continued, her voice soft as if she were explaining the obvious to a child.</p><p>“I’m… aware,” Rio sighed. “I just couldn’t stand the thought of getting into a bed alone… that’s all.”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a long moment, eyes tracing over Rio’s features. “Do you think it’s anxiety about the surgery?”</p><p>Rio pondered her question. “Yes. No. Maybe. I don’t know, I just… I can go if you want…”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said quickly, eyes darting from Rio to the bed behind her. She stood and went to the head of the bed, picking her phone up off the nightstand. “I’m setting an alarm for eight o’clock in the morning. You’ll have to go get in your own bed before Nicky wakes up.” Rio nodded in agreement. Agatha turned down the covers and laid down in bed before looking at Rio again. “Well? Are you coming?”</p><p>Rio scrambled onto the bed, ruffling the covers as she hurried to tuck herself in beside Agatha, who was giggling softly at her antics. Agatha pulled the covers up around them, and Rio turned onto her side, scooting back into Agatha’s open arms and resting her head on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“Comfy?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Rio nodded and let out a contented hum. The incessant buzzing beneath her skin was gone, the ache in her chest soothed by the warmth of Agatha’s body pressed against her own.</p><p>“Goodnight, my love,” Agatha whispered, pressing a soft kiss to the back of Rio’s neck.</p><p>“G’night, m’love,” Rio muttered sleepily.</p><p>Yes, Rio thought as she drifted off, this was exactly how she wanted to spend every night for the rest of her life.</p><p> </p>
