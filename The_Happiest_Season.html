<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agathario AU, but it's actually just the plot of Happiest Season, but they are choosing each other this time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Okayyyyy so I decided I was going to post on ao3 everyday from now until Christmas, SO if the writing is lower quality just know I am writing 20-25 chapters in less than a month. ALSO, the more I write this one the more I feel bad abt having Agatha leave Wanda just because she is scared to come out to her family...so I deeply apologize now and I am trying to make it as tasteful as possible and write it in a way that Agatha chooses Rio because she really truly loves her and not in an asshole way. Anyway I could keep rambling on the morality of this all day and my own moral battle with it, but hopefully I do them justice and if you don't like it DONT READ IT!</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>Snow tapped gently against the living room windows, a soft, uneven rhythm that blended with the low hum of the heater and the distant city noise below. It was the kind of winter evening that made the whole world feel muffled, held in place. Inside, the apartment glowed with warm lamplight; golden, low, cozy in a way only Wanda ever managed to make it.</span></p><p><span>Wanda was curled on the couch, half-buried in a knitted blanket and wearing one of Agatha’s old charcoal sweaters, the sleeves swallowing her hands. Her hair was still slightly damp from her shower, curling at the ends as it dried. She nursed a too-big mug of hot chocolate piled with an objectively irresponsible amount of marshmallows, courtesy of Agatha, who would deny to her grave that she’d made it on purpose.</span></p><p><span>Across from her, Agatha sat with a book open in her hands, her glasses perched low on her nose. She wasn’t actually reading; her eyes had lingered on the same paragraph for so long it had practically faded from the page. Instead, she watched Wanda between the lines, watched her little soft smiles at the holiday movie flickering on the TV, watched the way she pressed her knee gently against Agatha’s leg as if to make sure she was still there.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s bare feet were tucked securely under Agatha’s thigh, warming her through her black leggings. Agatha kept one hand loosely draped across the couch cushion, fingers close to Wanda’s hair. Every few minutes, almost without thinking, she reached out and twirled a curl around her finger; slow, absentminded, affectionate in a way she’d never let anyone else see.</span></p><p><span>Their home was a patchwork of their tastes, Agatha’s stern dark-wood furniture softened by Wanda’s throw pillows in warm reds and creams; Wanda’s fairy lights draped over Agatha’s bookcase like it needed a little magic. Wanda had snuck a tiny potted pine onto the windowsill last week, and Agatha had grumbled about it until Wanda pressed a kiss to her cheek, after which the tree stayed without further comment.</span></p><p><span>On the TV, some Christmas rom-com played at low volume; Wanda’s pick, of course. One of the ones where everyone’s problem could be solved if they communicated for five minutes. Agatha had scoffed at it earlier, but now she let it run, flipping a page she definitely hadn’t read.</span></p><p><span>Wanda shifted, settling more fully against her side, cheek brushing Agatha’s ribs. “You’re not reading,” she murmured, not looking away from the screen.</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted. “I am. I’m multitasking.”</span></p><p><span>“You’ve turned the same page four times.”</span></p><p><span>“Maybe it’s a very complex page.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda smiled into her mug, dimples peeking out, and Agatha felt something warm and unfamiliar expand in her chest. She leaned down and pressed a light kiss into Wanda’s hair, quick, almost shy for someone with a reputation for being sharp-edged and impossible.</span></p><p><span>It was the kind of quiet evening she never thought she’d have in her lifetime, soft, safe, full of gentle things. A room warmed by more than just the heater. A place where she didn’t have to brace herself.</span></p><p><span>She watched Wanda lick a stray marshmallow from her thumb, her brow furrowed as she focused on the movie. Agatha was hopelessly gone for this woman, she knew it, she felt it, and she didn’t bother hiding it in moments like this.</span></p><p><span>She reached over, brushing a curl behind Wanda’s ear. “You okay, sweetheart?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda nodded. “Mmhm. Just comfy.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let her fingers drift through her hair again, letting herself sink into the moment, the movie, the warmth, the weight of Wanda’s feet under her leg, the scent of cocoa and pine.</span></p><p><span>It was calm. It was peaceful. It was perfect.</span></p><p><span>And in a few minutes, Wanda would shatter it without meaning to.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt Wanda shift beside her again. It was small, just a twitch of her thigh, the tightening of her fingers around the mug, but the motion had a pulse of tension behind it that didn’t match the cozy scene around them. Wanda had been doing it all night. Fidgeting. Checking her phone every time the screen lit up. Zoning out in the middle of scenes she usually gasped and giggled at.</span></p><p><span>Agatha let her eyes drift from the page she wasn’t reading to Wanda’s face. She’d gone soft in the cheeks from the heat of the blanket and the cocoa, but her brows were drawn tight, her lips pressed together like she was mentally rehearsing a speech she absolutely did not want to give.</span></p><p><span>“Alright,” Agatha finally murmured, snapping her book shut with one hand. “Spit it out, sweetheart. You’re vibrating like a damn tuning fork.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s head jerked toward her, eyes wide, guilty. “What? Nothing! I’m not- I’m fine.”</span></p><p><span>“That was fast.”</span></p><p><span>“What was fast?”</span></p><p><span>“Your lying.” Agatha raised a brow. “Even for you, that was record-breaking.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s shoulders went up to her ears. “I’m not lying.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re twitching like a squirrel in traffic.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda made an offended little squeak, burying half her face in the collar of Agatha’s sweater. “I am not twitching like a squirrel.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted. “You absolutely are.”</span></p><p><span>She let the teasing hang lightly in the air, hoping Wanda would laugh, roll her eyes, and finally confess whatever was eating her. But Wanda didn’t laugh. She didn’t even smile. Instead she took another sip of hot chocolate, set the mug very carefully on the coffee table, and drew her knees closer to her chest.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s stomach pricked with something cold.</span></p><p><span>Before she could push further, Wanda grabbed the remote and turned the movie down another notch, then another, until it was barely a whisper of sound.</span></p><p><span>Agatha knew that move. Wanda only turned the volume that low when she was about to say something she wished she could drown out with noise.</span></p><p><span>She watched Wanda breathe- slow in, slow out- preparing herself. Agatha waited, patient but wary.</span></p><p><span>Then, just when Wanda seemed ready to speak, she chickened out again and reached for her phone.</span></p><p><span>That was it.</span></p><p><span>Agatha reached out and plucked the phone cleanly from her hand.</span></p><p><span>“Hey!” Wanda protested, but it was weak.</span></p><p><span>“No more stalling,” Agatha said. “Tell me what’s going on.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda hesitated, then inhaled sharply. “Okay. So. Funny story-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha tensed. </span><em><span>Oh no. Not a funny story.</span></em></p><p><span>“-my dad wants to see you!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. “…Why?”</span></p><p><span>“Well, not </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> you.” Wanda waved her hands. “Just… you as my friend.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s book slid off her lap and thumped onto the floor.</span></p><p><span>Wanda winced. “Surprise?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at her. “Try that again.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s words came out in a single breathless spasm. “So-I-may-have-invited-you-home-for-Christmas.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s entire body went still.</span></p><p><span>“And,” Wanda continued, already panicking, “I may have-kind of-accidentally-told them you’re my best friend.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked once. Twice.</span></p><p><span>Wanda rushed on, her voice rising like she was sprinting downhill with no brakes. “It wasn’t planned! I was on the phone with my mom and she asked if I was bringing anyone this year and I panicked and said yes and then she asked who and I panicked </span><em><span>again</span></em><span> and then suddenly you were my best friend and then she got excited and then she told my dad and then it was too late to correct it and then-”</span></p><p><span>“Wanda.”</span></p><p><span>“-and then Pietro texted me seventeen emojis in a row including a snowman and a winking face and I don’t know what that means but it felt ominous and-”</span></p><p><span>“Wanda.”</span></p><p><span>“-and then my dad asked what you like to eat and whether you’re allergic to pine because he bought a new tree and then Lilia asked if you were single because she wants to marry me off before the new year even though she’s like eighty-seven and-”</span></p><p><span>“Wanda.” Agatha’s voice finally cut through, low and firm.</span></p><p><span>Wanda clamped her mouth shut. She looked like she was going to cry or combust.</span></p><p><span>Agatha took a slow, heavy breath. “Start. Over.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda inhaled like she was about to dive underwater. “I invited you home with me for Christmas.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s pulse throbbed in her throat.</span></p><p><span>“But…” Wanda squeezed her eyes shut, wincing at the word. “I told them you’re my best friend.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed. Hard.</span></p><p><span>“They don’t know about us,” Wanda whispered. “Not yet. I didn’t tell them.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s chest tightened.</span></p><p><span>“I was going to!” Wanda added quickly. “I swear I was. I just-my mom asked so many questions and my dad was shouting from the other room about the guest linens and Pietro was FaceTiming me and showing me his kids fighting with wrapping paper tubes and it just happened and I panicked, Aggie, I panicked-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt her vision blur for a second. Not with tears, her eyes didn’t sting, but with something sharp and cold that tunneled her focus.</span></p><p><span>Her hands went still on the couch.</span></p><p><span>Her breath stuttered.</span></p><p><span>Her shoulders tensed, curling inward like she was bracing for impact.</span></p><p><span>The edges of her sight flickered with ghosts, glimpses, nothing more:</span></p><p><span>Christmas lights reflecting in a window.</span></p><p><span>A woman’s shadow, tall and angry, pacing.</span></p><p><span>A voice like claws: </span><em><span>Can’t you do anything right?</span></em></p><p><span>The scent of pine and alcohol.</span></p><p><span>The feeling, raw and familiar, of being a disappointment, a secret, a burden.</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. Once. Twice. Three times. Forced herself back into the room.</span></p><p><span>Wanda was still talking, still rambling, her voice cracking under the weight of anxiety she didn’t know how to carry.</span></p><p><span>“They’re already stressed,” Wanda said, twisting her hands in her lap. “I didn’t want to add anything more.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt herself shrinking. Quietly, invisibly.</span></p><p><span>Wanda kept going, oblivious. “My family just… expects a certain version of me. The one who had perfect grades and joined choir and never dyed her hair and-God-I know how it sounds, I do. But it’s only a few days. Just a few. And once the holiday is over, I’ll tell them everything. I promise.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s voice, when it came, was eerily calm.</span></p><p><span>“So you want me,” she said slowly, “to play your little closeted roommate act? For Christmas?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda flinched. “Aggie, it’s not like that.”</span></p><p><span>“It sounds exactly like that.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s complicated.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s cowardice.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s eyes filled instantly, bright with wounded surprise. “That’s not fair.”</span></p><p><span>“What part of this feels fair to </span><em><span>you</span></em><span>?” Agatha shot back, but her voice never rose. It stayed level, controlled, dangerously so.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s breath hitched. “I’m trying. You know I am.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t answer, and the silence between them grew taut enough to snap.</span></p><p><span>Wanda pressed her palms to her eyes, voice cracking. “I don’t want them to look at me differently.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled a shaky breath. She wasn’t angry, not exactly. She was hurt. Deeply. In a way she wished didn’t feel so young, so old, so familiar.</span></p><p><span>What she heard wasn’t </span><em><span>I don’t want them to look at me differently.</span></em></p><p><span>What she heard was </span><em><span>I don’t want them to know about you.</span></em></p><p><span>She leaned back slightly, instinctive self-protection tightening her posture. Her arm withdrew from around Wanda’s shoulders. The warmth faded instantly.</span></p><p><span>Inside her mind, the old truths whispered:</span></p><p><em><span>I hate Christmas.</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>I hate pretending.</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>I hate being anyone’s secret.</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>But she loves her. God, she loves her.</span></em></p><p><span>And loving Wanda meant swallowing things she’d rather spit out.</span></p><p><span>Wanda felt the shift immediately. She looked up, red-eyed, panicked. “Aggie-please. Don’t pull away.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m not pulling away,” Agatha lied.</span></p><p><span>Wanda reached for her hands, small, warm fingers curling desperately around hers. “I want you there. I need you there. Please, Aggie. I can’t do Christmas without you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared down at their joined hands.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s thumbs were trembling.</span></p><p><span>Her eyes were wide, terrified, not of Agatha, but of losing her.</span></p><p><span>And in that fear, Agatha saw the truth: Wanda wasn’t being malicious. She wasn’t trying to hurt her. She was scared. Cornered by her own family’s expectations, by her own history, by the impossible weight of becoming someone different than the girl they remembered.</span></p><p><span>Agatha understood that kind of fear. Too well.</span></p><p><span>She sighed, long and low, the kind that carried years of exhaustion. Wanda watched her with breath held like a child waiting for a verdict.</span></p><p><span>Finally, Agatha rasped, “...Fine.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda gasped in relief and surged forward, throwing her arms around her. “Thank you. Thank you, thank you-”</span></p><p><span>“But,” Agatha cut in, voice still rough, “you owe me. And you owe yourself the truth eventually.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda nodded frantically. “I know. I know I do. And I will. Someday, I promise.”</span></p><p><span>Someday.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Not now.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Not soon.</span></p><p><span>Agatha let her wrap around her like a blanket, let Wanda press desperate kisses to her cheek, let her bury her face in Agatha’s neck.</span></p><p><span>But over Wanda’s shoulder, Agatha’s eyes drifted to the window, the snow falling in slow spirals, the reflection of the movie lights flickering on the glass. It felt too much like a memory she didn’t want to revisit.</span></p><p><span>She held Wanda tighter anyway.</span></p><p><span>Because she loved her.</span></p><p><span>Because she was needed.</span></p><p><span>Because she didn’t know how to say no to Wanda when she was trembling.</span></p><p><span>Wanda pulled back just enough to whisper, soft and earnest, “This is going to be good. You’ll see. They’re going to love you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha forced a smile. “What could possibly go wrong?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda laughed weakly, relieved.</span></p><p><span>Agatha kept smiling until Wanda rested back against her chest and the room quieted again.</span><span><br/>
<br/>
</span></p><p><span>But the smile didn’t reach her eyes.</span></p><p><span>And deep inside, a familiar ache settled in, a quiet warning she chose, for now, to ignore.</span></p><p><span>The apartment felt different now.</span></p><p><span>Not immediately, nothing so dramatic as the lights dimming or the temperature dropping. But something in the air had thinned, like the room had been holding its breath and finally realized it couldn’t anymore.</span></p><p><span>Wanda felt it first.</span></p><p><span>She stayed close to Agatha on the couch, their knees still angled toward each other, but the space between them had changed. Where warmth had hummed earlier, soft, lived-in, familiar, there was now a jitter of static. A quiet that wasn’t peaceful. A quiet that was waiting.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t speak. She’d said yes. She’d meant it. And yet the yes sat heavy on her tongue, bitter around the edges, like a swallowed curse that hadn’t dissolved.</span></p><p><span>The movie continued to play, its bright holiday cheer suddenly sounding hollow, tinny, too sweet in a way that made Agatha’s teeth ache.</span></p><p><span>Wanda tugged her blanket tighter around herself. “We… we don’t have to keep watching this.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t look away from the TV. “I don’t mind.”</span></p><p><span>That was true. She didn’t mind. She just didn’t care, either.</span></p><p><span>Wanda watched her for a long moment, searching, hopeful, then quietly frightened as her searching found nothing.</span></p><p><span>“Are you mad at me?” Wanda’s voice was small, fragile. The kind of voice that usually made Agatha’s chest soften automatically.</span></p><p><span>This time, the softness didn’t come right away.</span></p><p><span>“I said I’d go,” Agatha replied. It wasn’t an answer. They both knew it.</span></p><p><span>Wanda tucked her feet under herself. She didn’t lean into Agatha this time. She wasn’t sure she was allowed to.</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t mean to hurt you,” Wanda whispered.</span></p><p><span>“I know.” And she did. Wanda wasn’t cruel. Wanda wasn’t calculating. Wanda was anxious and conflict-averse and catastrophically earnest. But intention wasn’t the issue tonight, not entirely.</span></p><p><span>What mattered was the echo inside Agatha. And echoes didn’t care about intentions.</span></p><p><span>The snow hit the windows harder now, the wind picking up, whistling faintly against the glass. A draft slipped under the sill, brushing against Agatha’s bare ankle.</span></p><p><span>She rubbed her thumb absently against the spine of her abandoned book.</span></p><p><span>Wanda swallowed. “You’re retreating.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked at the TV. “Am I?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda hesitated. “Yes.”</span></p><p><span>The word landed between them like something dropped.</span></p><p><span>Agatha could feel herself doing it, the invisible steps backward. The inward folding. The automatic shutting of internal doors one by one. Her mind trying to protect her heart the way it always had: quietly, ruthlessly, efficiently.</span></p><p><span>But Wanda wasn’t supposed to be someone she needed to protect herself from.</span></p><p><span>That was the problem.</span></p><p><span>“Talk to me,” Wanda whispered. “Please.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha finally turned. Slowly. As if her neck were stiff or the movement required conscious effort.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s eyes were already shining, too honest to hide anything well. “Tell me what’s happening in your head.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha wanted to. God, she wanted to. The words pressed at her teeth, heavy and frightened: I hate being hidden. I hate feeling like your shame. I hate how familiar this feeling is. I hate that I love you enough to say yes anyway.</span></p><p><span>But all that came out was:</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“It’s been a long night.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda didn’t look away. “I told you the truth. Even if it came out messy. Even if it was awful. Can you tell me yours?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s jaw clenched.</span></p><p><span>Her truth wasn’t simple. Her truth was a long, ugly thread that led back years, decades, to rooms where she’d sat small and silent, watching adults pretend nothing was wrong, pretending right along with them because pretending kept the peace.</span></p><p><span>Christmas had always been the worst. A performance wrapped in tinsel.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t want to admit any of that. Didn’t want to give those memories power in the present. But Wanda’s gaze stayed steady, gentle, insistent in that quiet way that said she wasn’t trying to force anything, just trying not to lose the person in front of her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled through her nose. “I don’t like secrets. That’s all.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda nodded, even though they both knew that wasn’t all.</span></p><p><span>“I don’t want you to be a secret,” Wanda said softly.</span></p><p><span>“No?” Agatha arched a brow just enough to make the point without cruelty.</span></p><p><span>Wanda winced. “I’m scared.”</span></p><p><span>That, finally broke something in Agatha. The smallest crack, but a crack nonetheless.</span></p><p><span>She softened. Visibly. A fraction. “I know.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda shifted closer, only an inch, but she stopped herself from reaching out again. Agatha could see the restraint trembling in her hands. “I’m not scared of them knowing about you,” she said quietly. “I’m scared of what they’ll do with that information about me. I’m scared they’ll look at me like I’m… wrong.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha breathed in deeply, her chest tight. She had no fight left, not the sharp kind, anyway.</span></p><p><span>“You’re not wrong,” she murmured. It was instinctive. It was true.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s lips trembled. “But they might think I am.”</span></p><p><span>“And you’d rather protect them from discomfort than protect me from feeling erased.” It wasn’t an accusation. It was a quiet truth.</span></p><p><span>Wanda closed her eyes, a tear slipping free. “I’m trying,” she whispered.</span></p><p><span>“I know.” And Agatha meant that, too.</span></p><p><span>The wind moaned against the windowpane. A pile of snow slipped from the fire escape above, thumping downward in a dull spray that startled Wanda enough that she flinched. Agatha’s hand moved automatically, just a brush on Wanda’s knee, steadying.</span></p><p><span>Wanda leaned into the touch like it was gravity.</span></p><p><span>“Are we okay?” Wanda asked, barely audible.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She weighed the question. Weighing them. Weighing herself.</span></p><p><span>Finally, she said, “We will be.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s breath left her in a trembling sigh.</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked around the apartment then, the dark wood furniture, the soft blankets Wanda insisted on, the cheerful lights that blinked unevenly because Wanda was terrible at checking bulb wires. An hour ago, it had all felt warm. Safe. The little universe they’d built together.</span></p><p><span>Now it felt like a place holding two heartbeats that were desperately trying to sync back up.</span></p><p><span>“We’re not done talking about this,” Agatha added gently.</span></p><p><span>“I know.”</span></p><p><span>“But not tonight.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda nodded, exhausted by her own anxiety. “Okay.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha lifted her arm, slowly, giving Wanda the chance to refuse, which Wanda didn’t. Wanda scooted in, tucking herself small against Agatha’s side.</span></p><p><span>Agatha held her. Carefully. Thoughtfully. A little stiff, but real.</span></p><p><span>The quiet returned, but it wasn’t the soft, contented hush from earlier. It was tentative. Bruised. Mending itself in small breaths.</span></p><p><span>On the TV, the movie’s characters kissed under falling snow, all shining music and uncomplicated joy.</span></p><p><span>Wanda let out a weak laugh. “That used to feel romantic.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha made a low noise, half hum, half sigh. “We can still get there.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda pressed her face into Agatha’s shoulder. “Promise?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha hesitated for a heartbeat.</span></p><p><span>Then: “Promise.”</span></p><p><span>Outside, the snow kept falling.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Inside, the warmth would take longer to return.</span></p><p><span>But they stayed right where they were.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Together.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Even in the uneasy quiet.</span></p><p><span>And that was enough. For tonight.</span></p>

<p>Snow thickened as they left the highway and crossed into Westview, the town unfolding in a string of postcard-perfect details Wanda had always spoken of with a fond, embarrassed smile. It was late December, the kind of cold that sharpened the world to crystal edges. Streetlamps lined the road, each wrapped in garlands so fluffy they looked like they came prepackaged from a craft store. Wreaths hung on every post, every door they passed, some tasteful and some… less so. Hard lefts in red glitter, bows that would blind a person in full sunlight, lights blinking in erratic morse code.</p><p>And then, as if Westview wanted to make absolutely sure no visitor missed the point:</p><p> </p><p><b>WELCOME TO WESTVIEW!</b><b><br/></b> </p><p>Painted in red and green and outlined with actual twinkle lights.<br/>At three in the afternoon.</p><p>Agatha stared at the sign for a long beat before muttering, “Christ, it’s like a Hallmark movie threw up.”</p><p>Wanda let out a strained little laugh, the sound people make when they agree but desperately need you to pretend otherwise. She kept both hands tight on the wheel, eyes forward, posture already shifting. Straighter spine. Tighter jaw. An eagerness that was more muscle memory than genuine excitement.</p><p>Agatha noticed it instantly.</p><p>Wanda only acted like this around one group of people.</p><p>“You okay?” Agatha asked, voice softer than her earlier snark.</p><p>“Mm?” Wanda blinked, too quickly. “Oh-yeah. Of course. Just… you know. Home.”</p><p>Home.<br/>The word sat strangely between them.</p><p>As they drove deeper into town, storefronts appeared: the bakery Wanda had once described as “the place that almost killed Pietro the year he tried to eat an entire challah by himself,” the florist with its lopsided menorah display, the community center putting up a hand-painted banner for the CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTING &amp; WINTER PARADE!!!- three exclamation marks absolutely mandatory in Westview, apparently.</p><p>Agatha watched it all with narrowed eyes, as if bracing for impact. “Can’t believe they didn’t throw in fake snow machines. Really committing to the bit.”</p><p>Wanda’s knuckles whitened around the steering wheel. “Actually… they do that. For the parade.”</p><p>Agatha groaned. Wanda smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes.</p><p>The farther they drove, the more Wanda transformed, small ways at first, but unmistakable. Agatha had spent enough time cataloging the micro-expressions of the woman she loved to recognize when something was off. Wanda was breathing a little too fast. She kept checking the mirror. She smoothed her hair five times in five minutes.</p><p>Family mode.<br/>Onset: rapid.</p><p>By the time they turned onto the Maximoff street, a quiet residential road lined with single-family homes and aggressively decorated lawns, Wanda had gone nearly silent.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach tightened.</p><p>The Maximoff house came into view, large enough to hold entire holidays worth of extended relatives and decorated within an inch of its life. Lights framed every window. A huge wreath hung on the door. The walkway was lined with candy-cane stakes.</p><p>The second the car rolled to a stop in the driveway, Wanda inhaled sharply. Agatha reached over and brushed her fingers lightly against Wanda’s knee in reassurance.</p><p>Before Wanda could exhale, the front door burst open.</p><p>“WANDAAAAA!” Pietro’s voice cracked through the cold like a firecracker.</p><p>“Oh God,” Wanda whispered.</p><p>Agatha barely had time to push open her door before a blur of silver jacket and too much cologne sprinted across the yard. Wanda yelped as Pietro grabbed her in a crushing bear hug, lifting her off the ground.</p><p>“Look at you! Look at you!” Pietro spun her once. “The prodigal twin returns!”</p><p>“I saw you two months ago!” Wanda wheezed.</p><p>“Long enough.” Pietro only squeezed harder.</p><p>Then Iryna Maximoff swept out the door, a whirlwind in a long wool coat and a knitted scarf. “Wanda, darling! Your face! You look tired-are you eating? Is the city feeding you? Pietro, put her down!”</p><p>Behind her came Olek, slower but booming, calling out, “Our girl is home!” Two cousins trailed after, carrying a stack of mismatched serving dishes for no apparent reason other than chaos.</p><p>Agatha stepped out of the car with the luggage, standing there like an unused prop in the wrong scene. Wanda disappeared beneath a wave of arms, voices, overlapping questions.</p><p>“How was the drive?”<br/>“Did you bring winter boots?”<br/>“Did you hear about the new neighbors?”<br/>“Your hair is so long!”<br/>“We made your favorite stew.”</p><p>No one noticed Agatha.</p><p>Not her leather gloves gripping the suitcase handles.<br/>Not the slightly raised eyebrow she wore as armor.<br/>Not the way she waited, seconds, then nearly a minute, for Wanda to glance her way.</p><p>Finally Wanda surfaced from the swarm, breathless, hair disheveled. She looked around, searching, guilty, and spotted Agatha beside the car at last.</p><p>“Oh! Um-” Wanda cleared her throat. “Everyone, this is… Agatha.”</p><p>The pause stung.<br/>The smile Wanda plastered on after stung worse.</p><p>“My friend. From the city.”</p><p>Friend.<br/>The word dropped like a stone.</p><p>“Ah!” Iryna said, giving Agatha a once-over that was polite but uninterested. “The roommate!” Olek nodded, already turning back to ask Wanda about her work schedule.<br/>One cousin waved awkwardly before stepping between them to hand Wanda another container of food.</p><p>Agatha stood still, snow melting slowly into her coat, the bags heavy in her hands.</p><p>Unseen again.<br/>Of course.</p><p>She didn’t show it. She simply lifted one suitcase in a sarcastic half-wave.</p><p>“Hi.”<br/>No one heard her.</p><p>Snow was still drifting around Agatha in lazy flakes when Wanda finally peeled herself out of the family knot and hurried to her side. Her cheeks were flushed, part cold, part nerves, and she flashed a smile that was too wide, too bright, too rehearsed. The kind she used when she wanted people to think everything was fine.</p><p>“Okay guys, I didn’t properly introduce Agatha,” Wanda tried again, still breathless. “My friend, who’s spending the holidays with us.”</p><p>There it was again.<br/>Friend.<br/>Dropped like a casual detail, light as air, heavy as a stone.</p><p>Iryna turned politely, offering a thin-lipped smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Oh yes, yes, the roommate. Lovely. Welcome.” She gave Agatha a quick pat on the arm, the kind you give a stranger’s dog, and immediately turned back to Wanda to fuss with her scarf. “You’re freezing! Did you not wear layers? Honestly, Wanda, you know better than this.”</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, Pietro cut in. “Wait-this is the Aggie? The one who got Wanda to try yoga and then yelled at the instructor?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “He deserved it.”</p><p>Pietro barked out a laugh before turning to Wanda, already launching into a story about someone from their childhood who’d apparently gotten divorced again.</p><p>A cousin poked his head in, blinking sleepily. “Hey, Wanda. Good to see you. Oh, hey-”<br/>He looked at Agatha, hesitated, then added, “Friend.” And walked back inside.</p><p>Someone else immediately asked Wanda about her job. Someone else asked if she brought the cookies she promised. Someone else shouted across the yard asking if the car needed to be moved so Uncle Rudy could park later.</p><p>Agatha stood there with her suitcases, watching the choreography play out, feeling the sting of invisibility pulse against her ribs.</p><p>She wasn’t unfamiliar with being overlooked. She just hadn’t expected it here, not today, not after the car ride, not after last night’s promise-wrapped wounds.</p><p>But Wanda slid so easily into the current that there wasn’t even space for Agatha to step in.</p><p>Wanda didn’t correct them.<br/>Didn’t hesitate.<br/>Didn’t even glance at Agatha when someone said roommate.</p><p>Agatha clocked it with clinical precision.<br/>Every erasure.<br/>Every half-smile Wanda offered to cover the lie.<br/>Every quick apology smile, Wanda shot her when no one was looking, thin, brittle, gone too quickly.</p><p>Agatha swallowed it all down like something sharp.</p><p>“Let’s… go inside,” Wanda said finally, touching Agatha’s arm as if that made it better. “You must be freezing.”</p><p>Freezing wasn’t the word.<br/>Numb worked better.</p><p>The Maximoff house was a sensory assault the moment they stepped in.</p><p>“Homey” was the polite descriptor. “Chaotic museum of mismatched furniture” was the truer one.</p><p>Every wall was covered: family photos, hand-carved crosses, fading watercolors taped to the fridge, embroidered quotes in languages Agatha didn’t recognize. The living room looked like it had been decorated in layers over thirty years, with nothing ever thrown out.</p><p>It smelled like cinnamon and other spices, like stepping into a Christmas store, instead of a family home. Warmth radiated from the kitchen. Voices bounced off each other from every direction, someone arguing about ornaments, someone laughing, someone humming loudly and off-key.</p><p>Agatha felt the walls move in around her.<br/>Not in a claustrophobic way, she didn’t fear the space.<br/>She feared… the belonging.</p><p>Or the lack thereof.</p><p>This house had history.<br/>This house had roots.<br/>This house had a place for everyone in it.</p><p>Except her.</p><p>Wanda, on the other hand, slid right in.</p><p>Agatha watched her coat vanish from her shoulders under her mother’s hands and get hung by the door before she could protest. Wanda stepped into the kitchen to hug another relative, switching to rapid Polish without thinking. She helped add to the pot of potpourri simmering lightly on the stove. Laughed at something Pietro said.</p><p>But it wasn’t the laugh Agatha knew.</p><p>No, this one was lighter, higher, too fast. A laugh meant to soothe, not express joy. A laugh ripped straight from childhood habit.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach tightened.</p><p>Wanda didn’t act like this with her.</p><p>With Agatha, she laughed slower and deeper, smile tugging crooked, eyes going soft.</p><p>This, <em>this</em> was a version of Wanda she’d never met.<br/><br/></p><p>A version who belonged here more than she’d ever belong with Agatha.</p><p>She tore her gaze away just as someone lingered in the doorway.</p><p>A kid, sixteen, maybe, dark hair, sharp eyes, hoodie sleeves stretched over his knuckles like armor. He leaned against the wall, arms crossed, evaluating Agatha with the intensity of a detective or a cat deciding whether to bite.</p><p>Wanda noticed him and waved him over. “Billy, hey. Come say hi. This is… Agatha.”</p><p>Billy stepped forward, suspicious. “Hi.”</p><p>Agatha tipped her head, extending a hand with theatrical politeness. “Hello, Teen.”</p><p>Billy blinked. Slowly. Offended but trying not to show it. “It’s Billy.”</p><p>“That’s what I said.”</p><p>Wanda muffled a laugh into her sleeve.</p><p>Billy narrowed his eyes, sizing her up. “I’m not-like-little or whatever. I’m sixteen.”</p><p>“Congratulations,” Agatha deadpanned. “You’re almost a functioning adult.”</p><p>Billy’s mouth dropped open in disbelief. “Wha-? Okay, wow.” He turned to Wanda, pointing accusingly. “You didn’t tell me she was like this.”</p><p>Wanda shrugged, smiling. “You wanted her honest.”</p><p>Billy huffed. Then tried again, determined. “I, uh… I can carry your bag? Or something.”</p><p>Agatha lifted an eyebrow. “You’re volunteering?”</p><p>“Wanda said you’re very smart,” Billy said quickly, as if that explained everything. “Like intimidating smart. I figured helping you would be… y’know. Good.”</p><p>Wanda groaned softly. “I did not say intimidating.”</p><p>“You implied it.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Flattery will get you nowhere, Teen.”</p><p>He scowled, then grabbed her heaviest suitcase anyway, nearly toppling backward under the weight but refusing to show it.</p><p>“Where’s- your room?” he managed through gritted teeth.</p><p>Wanda stepped in quickly. “Guest room. End of the hall. Here- I’ll help-”</p><p>“No, I got it,” Billy insisted. He lifted his chin, muscles trembling, sheer willpower keeping him upright. “This is nothing. Totally fine. Easy.”</p><p>Agatha folded her arms, amused despite herself.</p><p>The kid was trying.<br/>Trying to impress her.<br/>Trying to win her approval like it mattered.</p><p>And for reasons she couldn’t quite name, that softened her, just a touch.</p><p>She didn’t show it.<br/><br/></p><p>But the corner of her mouth twitched upward.</p><p>“Lead the way,” she said. “And try not to die on the stairs, Teen.”</p><p>Billy glared, dragging the suitcase behind him with theatrical suffering.</p><p>And for the first time since stepping foot on Westview soil, Agatha felt something crack through the discomfort-</p><p>Not belonging.<br/><br/></p><p>But possibility.</p><p>The hallway smells like a mixture of furniture polish and whatever stew Wanda’s mother has simmering on the stove, earthy, clinging to the humid air. Agatha follows Wanda through the narrow corridor, still pretending she isn’t hyperaware of every word they’ve exchanged since stepping into this house. Noise from the kitchen swells and dips behind them, voices climbing over one another, laughter bouncing off wood paneling, the thump of footsteps overhead.</p><p>Wanda walks a half-step ahead, too quick, too stiff. Her shoulders hunch inward, arms tucked close to her sides as though the very walls have expectations she’s trying to meet.</p><p>Agatha watches her posture, how her back straightens the moment they pass a family photo, how her steps grow smaller and more controlled when Wanda’s mother calls out something about coats and boots being tracked in. Wanda’s voice rises when she answers, higher, breathier, eager to please.</p><p>Agatha hates it.</p><p>She hates how familiar the transformation looks. She’s done that dance before, years ago, in a house she refuses to think about. Becoming a smaller, quieter, reshaped version of herself to keep the peace. She vowed she’d never do that again. And she especially hates seeing Wanda do it, Wanda, whose whole body usually radiates warmth and contradiction and stubborn kindness. Wanda, who argues with cab drivers. Wanda, who corrects Agatha’s cynicism with a smile and a shove to the shoulder. Wanda, who loves openly and loudly in their apartment, who curls into her side on the sofa like she belongs there.</p><p>But here?</p><p>Here she moves like she’s stepping on eggshells.</p><p>They reach the end of the hallway. Wanda pauses, looking suddenly unsure, then opens a door with a soft, almost embarrassed push.</p><p>The guest room is small, too small for the intensity swirling between them. A cozy yellow lamp glows on the dresser. There’s a single bed in the middle of the room, topped with an aggressively floral comforter that looks like it’s been here for decades. The ceiling slopes downward on one side; the radiator in the corner clicks and hisses like it resents being awake. The window is fogged over with cold.</p><p>Agatha sets her bag down but doesn’t step in fully.</p><p>Wanda turns toward her slowly, wringing her hands once, twice, as though trying to warm them on her own guilt.</p><p>“So, um.” Wanda clears her throat. “This is us.”</p><p>Agatha raises a single eyebrow. “Us?”</p><p>Wanda’s smile flickers, too bright, too anxious. “I-I told them we’d just… alternate nights, like between the room and the couch.”</p><p>Agatha stares at her for a long, heavy second.</p><p>It’s not the bed. It’s never the bed.</p><p>It’s the word <em>alternate</em>.<br/>It’s what it implies.<br/>It’s what Wanda chose to signal to her family about them.</p><p>Wanda swallows. “Agatha-”</p><p>“No.” Agatha steps inside now, shutting the door with a quiet click. She crosses her arms slowly, deliberately. “Say the rest. You’re halfway through a sentence. Finish it.”</p><p>Wanda’s shoulders fold inward. “Please don’t be mad.”</p><p>“I’m not mad,” Agatha replies, calm but cutting. “I’m noticing.”</p><p>Wanda winces. “Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha waits.</p><p>“I thought this would be easier,” Wanda says softly. “For everyone.”</p><p>Easier.</p><p>Agatha feels the word hit her chest like a cold stone.</p><p>“Easier,” she repeats. “So the easiest version of us is the one where we’re roommates who don’t share a bed.”</p><p>“That’s not what I said.”</p><p>“It’s what you arranged.” Agatha gestures to the bed, the room, the sloped ceiling that suddenly feels like a trap closing in. “You did this before we even arrived.”</p><p>"I panicked,” Wanda whispers. “My mom asked how many rooms we needed, and- I didn’t know what to say.”</p><p>“You could have said the truth.”</p><p>“I know!” Wanda’s voice cracks in frustration. “I know. I just… they don’t understand. And I wasn’t ready for-” She breaks off, hugging herself. “You don’t know how they get.”</p><p>“Then tell me.” Agatha’s voice softens without her permission. “Tell me instead of shoving me into a closet the second we cross the town line.”</p><p>Wanda shuts her eyes. Her breath shakes as she exhales. “It’s not about hiding you.”</p><p>But the thing is-it is.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t say it out loud, but she knows Wanda hears it anyway.</p><p>Wanda takes a step closer, arms loosening at her sides. “I’m sorry. I’m really, really sorry. I didn’t mean for this to hurt you.”</p><p>“It didn’t hurt me,” Agatha says.</p><p>The lie is so thin that even the radiator hisses its protest.</p><p>Wanda opens her eyes, glossy and desperate. “Please don’t shut down. Not here. I’m already… barely holding it together.”</p><p>That breaks something small and stubborn inside Agatha. The part of her that wants to win this argument falters under the tremble in Wanda’s voice.</p><p>She sighs, dragging a hand through her hair. “I’m not shutting down. I’m just trying to keep up. One minute we’re us, and the next minute you’re-” She gestures vaguely. “A Stepford version of yourself.”</p><p>Wanda’s jaw tightens. “You think I <em>want</em> to be like that?”</p><p>“I think you are like that,” Agatha replies. “And you hate it. And I hate watching it.”</p><p>Wanda lets out a quiet, miserable laugh. “Great, so we both hate it.”</p><p>Another silence stretches, thick and uncomfortable, until Wanda sits down on the edge of the bed, elbows on her knees. “I told you this would be complicated.”</p><p>“You told me it’d be fine,” Agatha corrects. “You said your family would ‘love me.’”</p><p>“They <em>will</em>. Eventually.”</p><p>Agatha leans against the dresser. “But first I have to survive the ‘friend from the city’ phase.”</p><p>Wanda closes her eyes briefly, guilt flickering across her face like a shadow. “I shouldn’t have said that.”</p><p>“You shouldn’t have meant it.”</p><p>Wanda’s head snaps up, wounded. “I didn’t- Agatha, please.”</p><p>And that right there, that plea, raw and vulnerable, is what untangles the last knot of Agatha’s anger. Not all of it, but the sharpest edges soften.</p><p>Wanda looks so small. So torn. So deeply stuck between the person she is with Agatha and the person her family expects.</p><p>Agatha crosses the room and kneels in front of her, slow and deliberate. She places two fingers under Wanda’s chin and tilts her face up.</p><p>“Look at me.”</p><p>Wanda does. Her eyes are glassy, her breath uneven.</p><p>Agatha’s voice drops to a whisper. “I’m not your secret.”</p><p>“I know.” Wanda’s voice breaks. “I know you’re not.”</p><p>“So stop treating me like one.”</p><p>Wanda blinks rapidly, fighting tears she refuses to let fall. “I’m trying. I really am.”</p><p>Agatha studies her for a long, weighted moment. “Then let me help.”</p><p>“How?” Wanda asks, thick-voiced. “You can’t fix my family.”</p><p>“I don’t need to fix them,” Agatha says. “I need you to stop shrinking just because we’re under their roof.”</p><p>Wanda makes a soft, pained sound in the back of her throat, another crack in the armor she’s been welding around herself since they crossed the town line.</p><p>“I don’t know how,” she whispers.</p><p>Agatha gently touches her cheek. “Then I’ll remind you.”</p><p>Wanda exhales shakily, leaning into the touch. Her eyes close again, but this time it’s relief, not avoidance. “Okay.”</p><p>A small knock suddenly rattles the half-open door. Both women freeze.</p><p>Pietro’s voice carries through without waiting. “Yo, Wanda, Mom wants to know if your <em>friend</em> is coming to dinner or if she needs, like… milk? Or something?”</p><p>Agatha bites the inside of her cheek.</p><p>Wanda flinches as if the word friend is a physical slap. “We’re coming,” she calls out, voice bright and strained.</p><p>Pietro’s footsteps fade.</p><p>Agatha pulls back slowly, watching the conflict rebuild itself across Wanda’s expression like storm clouds re-forming.</p><p>“One battle at a time,” Wanda murmurs, almost to herself.</p><p>Agatha stands, smoothing her shirt. “Then let’s go lose this one together.”</p><p>Wanda huffs out a tiny laugh, the first real one since they got here. She slips her hand into Agatha’s.</p><p>Not laced.<br/>Not interlocked.<br/>Not bold.</p><p>Just fingertips brushing, a ghost of contact they’ll drop before anyone sees.</p><p>But it’s something.</p><p>For now.</p><p>“Dinner’s going to be chaos,” Wanda warns as they step into the hall.</p><p>“I figured,” Agatha says. “Your family seems allergic to silence.”</p><p>Wanda squeezes her fingers once, apologetic and grateful in the same breath. “Thank you. For… not walking out.”</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” Agatha replies.</p><p>And she means it, even as the din of the Maximoff household rises ahead of them, threatening to swallow them whole.</p><p>They reach the bottom of the staircase just as the house erupts with another wave of noise, keys jingling, someone yelling about missing gloves, Pietro laughing too loudly at something on his phone. The whole house feels alive in a way that makes Agatha’s skin tighten, like she’s stepped into a room where every conversation started ten minutes ago and she’s forever late to all of them.</p><p>Wanda’s fingers slip away from hers the moment they hit the threshold of the dining room.</p><p>Her mother swoops in immediately. “Wanda, sweetheart- can you set the table for tomorrow? We’re missing knives, I don’t know where they all walked off to. And the bread is burning, so if you could just-”</p><p>“Oh! I can help-” Wanda starts, already moving.</p><p>Agatha watches the shift happen in real time. The shoulders, the voice, the easy compliance. Wanda bends into the shape her family expects before she even thinks about it.</p><p>“Just a minute, Mama,” Wanda says, turning half-back toward Agatha. “I’m going to show Agatha where-”</p><p>“Wanda!” someone calls from the living room.<br/>“We need your hands over here!”<br/>“Where’s that extra throw pillow”<br/>“Can you check the oven?”<br/>“Wan, come look at this!”</p><p>Her name bounces like a pinball between rooms.</p><p>And there it is, that hesitation. Wanda looks at Agatha for a fraction of a second, torn, regret softening the corners of her mouth.</p><p>Agatha gives her half a nod.</p><p>She’s not even sure what she’s giving permission for, but it feels like that’s what Wanda is waiting on.</p><p>Wanda’s apology sits unspoken behind her eyes.</p><p>Then she goes.</p><p>Just like that.</p><p>Agatha remains standing near the bottom of the stairs as Wanda is swallowed instantly by the familiar chaos of her home. The kitchen steals her first. Wanda’s laugh, higher than usual, rings out as her mother pushes a dish towel into her hands. Pietro snakes an arm around her shoulders, tugging her into some sibling argument. Someone else hands her a spoon to taste.</p><p>And Wanda… she beams.</p><p>She shines in a way that is both beautiful and foreign.</p><p>Agatha watches her from the doorway, invisible to everyone but painfully aware of herself. The dining room is warm with baking heat and humming conversation; people move around one another with wordless choreography learned over years. Wanda steps right into it, like slipping back into the skin of her childhood.</p><p>It’s a dance Agatha has never learned.</p><p>“Leaving for dinner in fifteen!” someone yells.</p><p>Wanda laughs again. The sound is bright, unburdened, the Wanda her family knows—, family-Wanda, polished and enthusiastic, agreeable and grateful.</p><p>It is nothing like the Wanda who kisses her breathless on lazy Sunday mornings.<br/>Nothing like the Wanda who sits cross-legged on their couch arguing about documentaries. Nothing like the Wanda who confesses fears in the glow of refrigerator light.</p><p>Agatha takes one last look, one she doubts Wanda even sees, and steps back into the hallway.</p><p>The noise swells behind her, swallowing the silence she leaves in her wake.</p><p>Up the stairs.</p><p>Down the hall.</p><p>To the small guest room waiting like a forgotten thought at the far end of the house.</p><p>The door remains cracked from before. Agatha pushes it open with the slow drag of someone preparing themselves for solitude.</p><p>The room looks exactly as it did minutes earlier: dim, yellow-lit, floral comforter, slanted ceiling. But it feels different now. Like the air shifted. Like the molecules rearranged themselves while she was gone. The faint sounds from downstairs rise through the floorboards, baking sheets hitting the counter, plates stacking, Wanda’s voice floating upward in warm bursts of laughter.</p><p>Noise that belongs to someone else.</p><p>Noise she is not part of.</p><p>Agatha exhales through her nose, sharp and humorless. “She could’ve at least shut the door,” she mutters.</p><p>But of course Wanda didn’t. Wanda is in seven places at once now, all of them downstairs. There was no room left for a small gesture like closing a door behind her.</p><p>Agatha steps farther in. Her bag sits untouched in the corner, slouched like a dog waiting at a window. She doesn’t unpack it. She doesn’t even take off her coat at first. She just stands in the middle of the room, letting the murmur of distant family chatter wrap around her like a reminder of everything she’s not.</p><p>The radiator hisses. The floor creaks. Snow taps the windowpane like fingertips.</p><p>Agatha moves to the window without fully deciding to. She pushes two fingers against the cold glass, smearing a small oval of fog aside. Outside, Westview sits quiet, quaint, covered in a fresh dusting of snow. The porch lights from the neighboring houses glow soft and golden. A wreath hangs crooked on the mailbox. The street is empty.</p><p>It looks perfect. Perfect in the way things do when you know you don’t belong in the picture.</p><p>Her reflection meets her in the glass, dark hair, tired eyes, jaw set like she’s bracing for a punch.</p><p>She whispers to her own reflection, voice low, steady:</p><p>“Welcome to Westview.”</p><p>It comes out more bitter than she intended. More wounded than she’ll ever admit out loud.</p><p>The laughter downstairs crescendos, Wanda’s voice rising above the fray- bright, cheerful, the kind of sound that fits perfectly in this house.</p><p>Agatha forces herself to look away from the glass, from the version of herself it shows. She surveys the room again: the single bed, the cramped corners, the floral comforter, the air heavy with the scent of old wood and something sweet baking downstairs.</p><p>This room wasn’t prepared for <em>them</em>. It was prepared for whoever Wanda used to bring home. Friends. Study partners. The occasional roommate after a breakup.</p><p>Not for someone Wanda kisses.<br/>Not for someone Wanda sleeps beside.<br/>Not for someone Wanda loves.</p><p>Agatha swallows hard, unclenching her fist only when her nails threaten to break skin. She moves to the bed finally, but she doesn’t sit. She runs one hand over the comforter, smoothing out a crease.

<p><span>The call to leave for dinner comes not from Wanda, who is still two steps ahead of everyone in the chaos of getting ready, but from Iryna, who clapped loudly in the foyer as if summoning a herd.</span></p><p><span>“Coats! Shoes! Let’s go, let’s go! They don’t hold tables forever!”</span></p><p><span>Pietro calls from the living room, “Ma, they literally hold tables for you every year. They know us.”</span></p><p><span>“That is not the point!” Iryna shouts back. “We are late.”</span></p><p><span>They are absolutely late.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stands near the staircase, coat already on, hands in her pockets. She has been ready for five minutes, watching with dry amusement as the Maximoffs whirl around their house in a cyclone of half-finished tasks.</span></p><p><span>Tommy thunders down the stairs wearing sneakers with untied laces, skidding into the wall. Billy follows at a careful, measured pace, wearing a sweater that looks suspiciously as though he ironed it himself.</span></p><p><span>Pietro zips his coat and yells toward the kitchen, “Nonna! You coming?”</span></p><p><span>“No!” calls an older woman’s voice. “I will stay home! Too crowded. Bring me back fries!”</span></p><p><span>“You’re not supposed to have fries!” Iryna yells.</span></p><p><span>“I’m not supposed to have grandchildren either,” Lilia fires back. “And yet God punished me with twins.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha barks out a surprised laugh, but quickly smooths her expression when Wanda appears.</span></p><p><span>Wanda looks… beautiful.</span><span><br/></span><span>But in an accidental, effortless way.</span><span><br/></span><span>Hair down, lips a little flushed from the cold drafts of the house, coat half buttoned. She gives Agatha a quick look-half apology, half something else-and then she’s pulled immediately into a conversation with her father about parking.</span></p><p><span>Agatha feels the distance between them like a bruise.</span></p><p><span>“Okay!” Iryna orders. “Everyone to cars! Pietro, you drive with boys. Wanda, you come with us!”</span></p><p><span>“And your friend too,” Olek adds, almost as an afterthought. “The-what is name?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha steps forward and shakes his hand. “Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>“Ah! Yes. Agatha- the roommate.” He smiles politely, too politely.</span></p><p><span>Wanda flinches so subtly Agatha almost misses it.</span></p><p><span>They all spill onto the porch, the cold air biting harder than in the city. Tommy slips on ice and whoops. Billy scolds him for “never learning basic physics.” Pietro shoves them both toward the car.</span></p><p><span>The Maximoffs move together with the frantic ease of a family who’s been late to everything for twenty years.</span></p><p><span>Agatha moves with them but not among them.</span></p><p><span>Wanda catches her eye once as they head to the car, an apologetic flicker, too quick to read fully.</span></p><p><span>They pile into Olek and Iryna’s aging SUV. Wanda ends up in the middle of the backseat. Agatha gets the window seat, which would be nice if Wanda didn’t look like she was shrinking into herself to keep from brushing against her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stares out the window, jaw tight.</span></p><p><span>The drive is short, Westview is small enough that everything is practically next door.</span></p><p><span>“Here we are!” Iryna says with familiar pride as they pull into a parking lot lit by strings of red and gold Christmas lights.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>BOGNA’S STEAKHOUSE &amp; FAMILY GRILL</span><span><br/><br/></span></p><p><span>The sign is old and wooden, and the snow-dusted windows glow warmly.</span></p><p><span>It’s charming.</span><span><br/></span><span>Obnoxiously charming.</span></p><p><span>“Christ,” Agatha mutters, “Norman Rockwell would combust.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda elbows her gently. “Be nice.”</span></p><p><span>“Define nice.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s laugh is nervous and fleeting.</span></p><p><span>They all file inside, greeted by a blast of heat and a smiling hostess who beams at Iryna.</span></p><p><span>“Mrs. Maximoff! We’ve got your table. Right this way.”</span></p><p><span>Of course they do.</span></p><p><span>They’re led to a long booth, half bench, half chairs. People argue over seating like it’s a professional sport. Wanda ends up next to Pietro. Tommy and Billy flank them. Agatha… ends up at the far end, between Olek and the aisle.</span></p><p><span>Wanda sends her a small, apologetic glance across the table.</span></p><p><span>Agatha forces a smile she doesn’t feel.</span></p><p><span>Menus are passed. Water glasses clink. The table is loud.</span></p><p><span>Olek speaks first. “So, Agatha. Wanda tells us you two work together?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha raises an eyebrow at Wanda-</span><em><span>really?</span></em></p><p><span>Wanda avoids her eyes, pretending to read the wine list.</span></p><p><span>Agatha responds evenly. “We work in the same building.”</span></p><p><span>Iryna nods, barely listening. “And you live together too, yes?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda chokes on air. Pietro snorts loudly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha takes a slow sip of water. “Yes. The rent’s cheaper that way.”</span></p><p><span>It’s technically true. Just not the true she wants to say.</span></p><p><span>Iryna smiles approvingly. “Ah! Good. Wanda always needed someone responsible to keep her in line.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smiles back, but it’s thin, brittle.</span></p><p><span>Wanda kicks her under the table in apology.</span></p><p><span>Billy observes it all with a raised eyebrow, like he’s taking notes.</span></p><p><span>Tommy is too busy trying to stack butter packets.</span></p><p><span>The server approaches. “Can I get drink orders?”</span></p><p><span>Olek orders a beer. Iryna orders wine. Pietro orders a cocktail with a name that makes Iryna smack him. Wanda orders hot tea. Agatha says, “Whiskey, neat.”</span></p><p><span>Billy remarks under his breath, “Hardcore.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha glances at him. “Loosen up, Teen.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s </span><em><span>Billy</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s what I said.”</span></p><p><span>Across the table, Wanda hides a smile behind her menu.</span></p><p><span>Once orders are placed, Billy leans forward, studying Agatha like an alien species.</span></p><p><span>“So… you’re from the city?”</span></p><p><span>“Yep.”</span></p><p><span>“You like it there?”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Agatha says. “I adore it. It has noise, crowds, terrible drivers, expensive coffee- everything I need to function.”</span></p><p><span>Billy nods, intrigued. “I want to go there for college.”</span></p><p><span>“Far away from this suburban tundra?” Agatha gestures to the window. “Smart choice.”</span></p><p><span>Billy brightens like she just praised him, even though she didn’t.</span></p><p><span>Tommy squints at her. “How old are you?”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, absolutely not,” Agatha deadpans. “I’m not telling a teenage boy my age. You’ll weaponize it.”</span></p><p><span>Billy snorts.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Tommy whispers to Wanda, “I like her.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda shoots Agatha a tiny, grateful smile that lands somewhere between relief and longing.</span></p><p><span>Olek, meanwhile, asks Wanda about her job. Pietro teases her about her parking skills. Iryna interrupts everyone to ask if anyone wants to split an appetizer platter.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sits quietly, absorbing it all.</span><span><br/></span><span>She’s acknowledged, technically.</span><span><br/></span><span>But folded in, not integrated.</span><span><br/></span><span>Considered, not included.</span></p><p><span>Billy’s voice snaps her attention back.</span></p><p><span>“So what do you do, exactly?” he asks.</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirks. “Very important adult things that teens wouldn’t understand.”</span></p><p><span>Billy folds his arms. “Try me.”</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” she says. “I write grants and research proposals.”</span></p><p><span>Billy blinks. “Wow. That sounds…”</span></p><p><span>“Boring?” Agatha suggests.</span></p><p><span>“I was going to say complicated,” Billy says, offended. “But sure.”</span></p><p><span>“See?” Agatha says, triumphant. “Teen.”</span></p><p><span>He narrows his eyes at her. “I’m going to prove you wrong.”</span></p><p><span>“Good luck,” she says. “I love a challenge.”</span></p><p><span>The conversation shifts. People talk over one another. Menus close. Silverware clatters.</span></p><p><span>Wanda keeps glancing at Agatha, quick, worried flicks of her eyes that say </span><em><span>I know, I see this, I’m sorry</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Agatha answers those looks with tiny nods, pretending it doesn’t sting.</span></p><p><span>Then Wanda’s mother asks a particularly pointed question about Wanda’s nonexistent dating life.</span></p><p><span>Wanda responds automatically: “No one serious.”</span></p><p><span>And she doesn’t even glance at Agatha.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s jaw tightens.</span></p><p><span>Billy’s eyes flick between them, perceptive.</span></p><p><span>But no one else notices.</span></p><p><span>The moment Olek and Pietro fall into a debate about football and Iryna pulls out her phone to show baby pictures of the twins, Wanda scoots her chair back.</span></p><p><span>“I’m going to the restroom,” she murmurs to Agatha. “Come with me?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha drops her napkin onto the table and stands almost immediately.</span></p><p><span>Billy smirks. “Bathroom squad.”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t make it weird,” Tommy says, hitting him with a breadstick.</span></p><p><span>Agatha follows Wanda across the restaurant, past the bar, down a hallway lined with framed photos of local fishing trophies.</span></p><p><span>Wanda pushes open the bathroom door and steps aside to let Agatha in first.</span></p><p><span>The bathroom door swung shut behind them, muting the restaurant noise into a low, warm hum. The air inside was cooler, scented with cheap lavender soap and the sharp bite of disinfectant. Wanda checked the stalls to be sure they were alone, then leaned back against the sink like she needed something solid to hold her up.</span></p><p><span>Agatha crossed her arms.</span></p><p><span>Wanda winced immediately.</span></p><p><span>“I know,” Wanda whispered before Agatha could speak. “I know.”</span></p><p><span>“Do you?” Agatha kept her voice soft; anything louder would echo. “Because it kind of feels like you don’t.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda rubbed her forehead. “I’m doing the best I can.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s the problem,” Agatha murmured. “This version of ‘best’ seems to involve pretending I don’t exist.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda flinched; not dramatically, not theatrically, but like someone hit a bruise they didn’t know she had.</span></p><p><span>“It’s not that,” she said quietly. “My family is just… intense. And tonight is already complicated and I just- if I tell them everything at once, it’ll explode. And I don’t want to throw you into that.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked at her, really looked, because something about Wanda’s face was too tight, too pale at the edges. She was scared. Not of Agatha, not of the relationship, of the fallout.</span></p><p><span>“You’re not throwing me anywhere,” Agatha said, gentler now. “I walk into things willingly. Especially things involving you.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s eyes softened- just barely- but it was enough to make Agatha’s chest ache.</span></p><p><span>“I’m trying,” Wanda whispered. “I promise I’m trying.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled slowly. The fight wasn’t about winning. It never had been. Wanda was rattled, pulled between the woman she’d become and the girl her family expected. The conflict showed in her shoulders, in the way she couldn’t quite meet Agatha’s eyes.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stepped closer. “Then let me help. Don’t shut me out to make this easier for them.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s breath hitched at that, guilt and longing tangled together. She nodded slowly.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” she whispered. “I’ll… I’ll try harder.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded back. Not victory. Just temporary peace.</span></p><p><span>She nudged Wanda’s foot lightly with her own. “Your mascara’s smudged.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh god.” Wanda turned to the mirror, horrified. “Already?”</span></p><p><span>“It’s fine,” Agatha said, reaching into her coat pocket. “Come here.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda did, letting Agatha gently fix the corner of her eye with the pad of her thumb. Wanda’s eyes drifted shut. The air between them warmed, softened.</span></p><p><span>“Thank you,” Wanda murmured.</span></p><p><span>“Always,” Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>The quiet stretched, fragile but calm.</span></p><p><span>And then-</span></p><p><span>A soft knock landed on the bathroom door.</span></p><p><span>Both women jolted.</span></p><p><span>When they stepped out, Agatha expected another member of the Maximoff swarm, maybe Wanda’s mother with another reminder about reservation times, or Marina checking that Wanda hadn’t curled up in a stall from overstimulation.</span></p><p><span>She did </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> expect Wanda's ex...best friend.</span></p><p><span>Rio stood just outside the bathroom door, leaning lightly against the wall, hands tucked into the pockets of her jacket. The lighting by the hallway sconce framed her like some serene painting, calm, steady, composed in a way that felt enviable. She smiled politely when she saw them, her expression gentle and open, not prying.</span></p><p><span>“Oh! Sorry- I didn’t mean to startle you.” Rio stepped forward. “Wanda, your mom sent me to check on you. You’ve been gone a while.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda froze. Immediately awkward.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt Wanda’s hand twitch like she wanted to hide it behind her back or jam it into her coat. Meanwhile Rio gave a small, reassuring wave to Agatha, like she wanted to cut the tension before it could grow claws.</span></p><p><span>“Hi,” Rio said warmly. “I’m Rio. I don’t think we’ve met?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. She’d been expecting suspicion, judgment, something that matched the silent edge in the room at the house. But Rio’s tone held none of that. Just genuine kindness.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” she replied, steady but guarded. “Hi.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled, and it was the kind of smile that made other people soften against their will. “Nice to meet you.”</span></p><p><span>She glanced between the two of them, reading the invisible lines easily.</span></p><p><span>“So… Wanda?” Rio prompted gently. “How should I address her? Friend? Coworker? Roommate?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda panicked for exactly one half-second before blurting:</span></p><p><span>“Girlfriend. She’s my girlfriend.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s entire spine loosened, like someone had finally opened a window in a suffocating room.</span></p><p><span>Wanda had said it. Easily. Naturally. Like it was obvious. Like it wasn’t a secret.</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked, and then smiled even wider. “Oh! That makes sense. You two have that… energy.”</span></p><p><span>“What energy?” Wanda squeaked.</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted. “The gay energy, darling. Don’t make her spell it out.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed softly, hand over her mouth. “Exactly.”</span></p><p><span>Then her expression shifted, warm but serious, as she turned to Agatha.</span></p><p><span>“Do her parents know?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda answered so fast it might’ve broken sound speed: “No.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes slipped to Agatha, full of pity, but also understanding. Not condescending. Not judgmental. Just… seeing her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s stomach pinched, because Rio didn’t need a full explanation. She understood in an instant what this weekend would be for Agatha: walking a tightrope Wanda was scared to step on.</span></p><p><span>“I see,” Rio murmured.</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded once. So did Rio. Mutual awareness passed between them like a silent treaty.</span></p><p><span>“I’m sorry,” Rio said softly. “I know how that feels.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda looked stricken, both grateful and ashamed.</span></p><p><span>Before she could reply, Rio gently touched Wanda’s elbow. “Your mom’s getting restless. You know how she gets when a schedule slips.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda groaned quietly. “I know.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped back toward the dining area.</span></p><p><span>Agatha watched her go, impressed despite herself. “She’s very… composed.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda huffed out a laugh. “Yeah. She’s always been that way. My mother calls her ‘the sane one.’”</span></p><p><span>“And the rest of you?” Agatha teased.</span></p><p><span>“A dumpster fire held together with paprika.” Wanda grabbed her hand, finally, openly, and tugged her toward the dining room. “Come on before my mom drafts a search party.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let herself be pulled, her hand warm in Wanda’s.</span></p><p><span>The knot in her chest wasn’t gone, but it had loosened. Wanda had introduced her as her girlfriend. Out loud. To another human being. In this building full of people Wanda feared disappointing.</span></p><p><span>Agatha could breathe again.</span></p><p><span>As they entered back through the dining room, the noise of the restaurant wrapped around them; laughter, silverware, the rumble of conversations from other families spending their December evenings in the glow of red holiday garlands and paper snowflakes taped to the big windows.</span></p><p><span>Wanda glanced at Agatha, nervous but hopeful. Agatha lifted their joined hands slightly.</span></p><p><span>Wanda exhaled, relieved.</span></p><p><span>And from across the room, Rio caught the gesture, smiled knowingly, and subtly gave a reassuring nod.</span></p><p><span>By the time they reached the table again, Wanda had already let go of Agatha’s hand.</span></p><p><span>Not violently, not even consciously.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><span>It was a subtle, nervous slipping-away, like Wanda felt the eyes of the restaurant before they ever reached the table. One second they were walking together, fingers laced, linked by something fragile but real… and the next Wanda’s hand eased out of Agatha’s like sand falling away in a tide.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t say anything.</span><span><br/></span><span>She didn’t grab it back.</span></p><p><span>She just felt the sting settle somewhere low in her ribs.</span></p><p><span>They reached the long rectangular table, already partially set with napkins, menus, and sweating glasses of ice water. Wanda’s mother, Iryna, spotted them first. She lit up with the kind of enthusiasm one normally reserved for royalty or lottery winners.</span></p><p><span>“Oh! There you girls are,” she said, waving them over with a flourish. “We were beginning to wonder if you’d slipped out the back. Sit, sit!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha slid into an empty seat beside Billy, who immediately grinned at her like she was a new toy that had finally been handed over. Wanda took the seat on Agatha’s other side, shoulders tense, already bracing for impact.</span></p><p><span>They hadn’t even gotten their chairs fully tucked in before Iryna clasped her hands beneath her chin and said,</span></p><p><span>“Wanda, darling, guess who I saw when they came in?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed her eyes for one long, prophetic second.</span></p><p><span>Wanda didn’t blink. “Rio.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes!” Iryna’s delight was blinding. “Isn’t she just glowing these days? Such a beautiful young woman. And so poised. My goodness, she has always been like that, hasn’t she?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda offered a polite, tight smile. “Yeah. We saw her, actually. Just now.”</span></p><p><span>Iryna gasped like this was an extraordinary coincidence. “You did? Oh, how lovely! I told her that you two had run off to the bathroom and to look for you. Did she say hello? Was she with her parents? Oh, you know her father had that health scare last year, didn’t he? I really must ask how he’s doing-”</span></p><p><span>“Mama,” Wanda cut in gently, “yes. She said hi. She seemed fine.”</span></p><p><span>Her tone carried the polite plea of someone attempting to close a window during a storm.</span></p><p><span>But Iryna wasn’t done. Suddenly she turned her attention to Agatha with laser precision.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” she said warmly, too warmly, the kind of warmth that felt like an interrogation disguised in velvet. “Did Wanda introduce you to Rio? She and Wanda were the best of friends growing up. A shame they drifted apart during college, of course, but life takes us all in different directions!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze for exactly half a second, but she didn’t let it show. “Yes,” she said smoothly. “We met earlier.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, isn’t she lovely?” Iryna continued, not waiting for a response. “Such a striking girl. And brilliant. Her mother always said she was destined for great things.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha could feel Wanda stiffen next to her.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s father, Olek, joined the conversation with a booming chuckle. “Bah! ‘Destined for great things,’ indeed. She </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> doing great things. Did Wanda tell you? Rio became a surgeon.”</span></p><p><span>He leaned in slightly, as if sharing an impressive secret.</span></p><p><span>“A </span><em><span>surgeon.</span></em><span> One of the youngest in the state. Brilliant girl. And humble, too- none of that fancy ego nonsense you get in big cities.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha plastered on a small, polite smile.</span></p><p><span>Because what she wanted to reply with was:</span><span><br/></span><em><span>Yes, I’m aware. I met her ten minutes ago, and she was exceedingly lovely while Wanda panicked like the house was on fire.</span></em></p><p><span>Wanda’s hand twitched on her lap, Agatha could see the tiny movement from the corner of her eye. A silent apology. A mortified plea.</span></p><p><span>Iryna sighed dreamily, completely unaware of any tension in the air.</span></p><p><span>“You know,” she said, “I always thought you and Rio would end up-”</span></p><p><span>“Mama,” Wanda said sharply, cheeks flushing, “can we not do this right now?”</span></p><p><span>Iryna blinked. “Do what, darling?”</span></p><p><span>“Talk about Rio like she’s…” Wanda searched for the gentlest wording. “…the only topic in the universe?”</span></p><p><span>Olek laughed as if Wanda was joking. “Darling, we’re just proud of her! Nothing wrong with celebrating a hard worker.”</span></p><p><span>“Exactly,” Iryna agreed. “We always said she was a gem. The kind of girl any parent would be lucky to have around.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt that one in the sternum.</span></p><p><span>A gem.</span><span><br/></span><span>Any parent would be lucky to have her around.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t need a translation for what Iryna meant beneath the praise: </span><em><span>This is the bar. This is the standard for worthiness. And you are not it.</span></em></p><p><span>Wanda sucked in a subtle breath, quiet, but sharp. She turned slightly toward the table, searching for a new path through the minefield.</span></p><p><span>“Sooo…” she said, in a tone that sounded like she was physically wrestling the conversation into a new direction. “Mama, didn’t you want to ask Billy about his exam?”</span></p><p><span>It worked. Instantly.</span></p><p><span>Iryna’s eyes snapped to her grandson. “Oh! Yes! Billy, tell us, how did your chemistry final go? You said you were nervous.”</span></p><p><span>Billy groaned dramatically, slumping in his seat like he’d been mortally wounded. “It was horrible. Literally torture. I don’t know why high school needs chemistry anyway. Nobody needs to know how to neutralize acids unless they’re planning to become a supervillain.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted. “Or a responsible adult doing basic household cleaning.”</span></p><p><span>Billy gasped, affronted. “That’s what Google is for!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, smirking. “So your plan is to outsource all your adult responsibilities to the internet?”</span></p><p><span>“Yes?” Billy said, as though this were obvious.</span></p><p><span>Iryna and Olek were laughing. Wanda’s shoulders finally lowered by a fraction of an inch.</span></p><p><span>The tightness in the air dissolved, just a little.</span><span><br/></span><span>Not gone.</span><span><br/></span><span>But loosened enough that Agatha could breathe again.</span></p><p><span>Iryna turned to Monica to ask about work. Olek launched into a story with Marina about a neighbor’s snowblower accident. The restaurant buzzed around them, forks clinking, chairs scraping, Servers weaving through with steaks and bread baskets.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at her napkin for a moment, grounding herself.</span></p><p><span>Wanda leaned over, voice barely above a whisper. “Hey.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked at her.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s eyes were soft, apologetic, grateful, tired.</span></p><p><span>“Thank you,” Wanda murmured. “For not… walking out.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s lips twitched. “That was an option?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda nodded earnestly. “For you? Yes. Very.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh. “Relax. If I walked out, your mother would chase me with a breadstick.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda bit her lip, trying not to smile. “She would.”</span></p><p><span>They drifted back into silence, but it was gentler this time, not sharp with hurt.</span></p><p><span>Billy leaned toward them suddenly, stage-whispering, “Just so you know, Grandpa is about to ask you if you’ve ever been hunting.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. “Why would he ask me that?”</span></p><p><span>“Because you’re wearing black,” Billy replied grimly, “and he thinks everyone in black owns a crossbow.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared. “I- what?”</span></p><p><span>Billy nodded with the grave seriousness of a soldier on the frontlines. “Prepare yourself.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha opened her mouth to respond-</span></p><p><span>“Agatha!” Olek boomed. “Have you ever been hunting?”</span></p><p><span>Billy collapsed into silent laughter, shoulders shaking violently.</span></p><p><span>Agatha wanted to groan, or bang her head into the table, or maybe both. Instead she offered a very slow, very patient smile.</span></p><p><span>“No,” she said. “I haven’t.”</span></p><p><span>Olek nodded thoughtfully, stroking his chin like he was evaluating her moral fiber. “Shame. You look like you’d be good with a crossbow.”</span></p><p><span>Billy wheezed, losing all composure.</span></p><p><span>Wanda dropped her face into her hands.</span></p><p><span>Agatha lifted her water glass, sipped, and murmured under her breath, “Of course I do.”</span></p><p><span>Billy thumped the table, breathless. “I told you!”</span></p><p><span>The moment stretched into something almost warm, almost safe, almost normal.</span></p><p><span>For the first time that night, Agatha didn’t feel like a complete outsider.</span><span><br/></span><span>Maybe not welcomed.</span><span><br/></span><span>Not yet.</span></p><p><span>But tolerated.</span></p><p><span>And sometimes that was enough to survive the first cracks of a long, difficult weekend.</span></p><p><span>The server arrived to take their orders.

<p><span>Agatha had been asleep, </span><em><span>deeply</span></em><span> asleep, wrapped like a burrito in the aggressively floral quilt someone (Wanda’s mother, undoubtedly) had laid out the night before, when the door slammed open with enough force to rattle the hallway pictures.</span></p><p><span>“Good morning, sunshine!”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s voice.</span><span><br/></span><span>Too cheerful.</span><span><br/></span><span>Too bright.</span><span><br/></span><span>Too </span><em><span>fake.</span></em></p><p><span>Agatha cracked one eye open.</span></p><p><span>Wanda stood in the doorway wearing a red sweater sprinkled with tiny embroidered candy canes, her hair in a loose braid, cheeks flushed from excitement or nerves, probably both.</span></p><p><span>Agatha hated how much she loved her.</span></p><p><span>“No,” Agatha croaked, immediately burrowing back under the covers.</span></p><p><span>“Yes,” Wanda sang, crossing the room with the determined energy of someone who had already consumed caffeine and seasonal optimism in equal measure. “Up you get! We have to get ready!”</span></p><p><span>“For what?” Agatha groaned, voice muffled by the pillow.</span></p><p><span>Wanda didn’t answer with words. She held up a sheet of paper decorated with clip art holly and comic sans lettering and read it like she was announcing the Olympics:</span></p><p><span>“The Westview Annual Holiday Scavenger Hunt!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha made a sound that was somewhere between a death rattle and a moan of betrayal. “I refuse.”</span></p><p><span>“No you don’t,” Wanda chirped, pulling the blankets, like a criminal off Agatha’s body.</span></p><p><span>The cold air stabbed her immediately.</span></p><p><span>“Wanda,” Agatha snapped, clutching her pajama shirt, “do I look like someone who partakes in festive outdoor activities before noon?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda sat on the edge of the bed, poking her side. “You look like someone who loves me and therefore is coming to the scavenger hunt because it’s tradition and my family does it every year and if you don’t come they’ll definitely notice.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha squinted at her. “You’re weaponizing guilt.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes,” Wanda said sweetly. “Now move.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha opened her mouth to argue.</span></p><p><span>Wanda leaned down and kissed her forehead softly.</span></p><p><span>“Please?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha deflated like a dying balloon.</span></p><p><span>“Fine,” she muttered. “But I hope you understand I’m doing this under protest.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, I do,” Wanda said brightly. “I can literally feel your hatred radiating.”</span></p><p><span>“Good.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha managed to drag herself into clean jeans and a black sweater, which Wanda immediately declared “too funeral-y,” but she didn’t push it, probably because Agatha threatened to walk back to the city. On foot.</span></p><p><span>Then they headed downstairs into the Maximoff morning chaos.</span></p><p><span>The kitchen was a war zone of half-toasted bagels, crumbs, opened jars, burnt pans, and three different brand-name coffees. Everyone was talking at once.</span></p><p><span>Pietro was trying to spread butter on a bagel while arguing with their mother.</span><span><br/></span><span>Monica was yelling from the hall about someone stealing her scarf.</span><span><br/></span><span>Marina was on the phone with one of her neighbors about a snowblower,“Yes, I’m sure the snowblower is in our garage- because you put it in there last week, Dave.”</span></p><p><span>Billy sprinted through the room wearing mismatched socks, holding a donut in his mouth like a dog with a stick.</span></p><p><span>And Agatha stood at the edge of the kitchen, gripping a mug of coffee like it was the only thing tethering her to sanity.</span></p><p><span>She sipped quietly.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Observing the chaos around her like David Attenborough narrating the habits of a particularly disorganized pack of wolves.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s mother whirled past, shoving a muffin tin into the sink. “Wanda, sweetheart! Make sure you’re wearing layers. It’s freezing out there.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda smiled automatically. “I will.”</span></p><p><span>Pietro nudged Monica. “You ready for the hunt? Or are you still traumatized from last year?”</span></p><p><span>Monica threw a spoon at him.</span></p><p><span>Agatha watched all of it with a sort of uncomfortable fascination.</span></p><p><span>This was… a lot.</span><span><br/></span> <span><br/></span><span>A whole ecosystem of noise and expectations and overlapping conversations, none of which she belonged to.</span></p><p><span>Wanda noticed her standing there like a cornered cat and glided over, brushing a hand lightly against her back. Not resting it there, no public displays, not here, but enough to quietly reassure.</span></p><p><span>“Hey,” Wanda murmured. “You okay?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared down at her coffee. “I’m undecided.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda smiled like she knew exactly what that meant. “It’ll be fun. I promise.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Is that a threat?”</span></p><p><span>“Maybe,” Wanda whispered back.</span></p><p><span>Before Agatha could reply, Iryna rushed over, shoving a knit hat into Wanda’s hands. “Wear this. It’s windy out.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda laughed. “Mama, I’m fine-”</span></p><p><span>But Iryna had already turned her attention to Agatha.</span></p><p><span>“And you, dear,” she said, reaching out.</span></p><p><span>Agatha instinctively flinched back.</span></p><p><span>Iryna froze, surprised.</span></p><p><span>Wanda stepped forward quickly. “Mama-”</span></p><p><span>But Iryna wasn’t offended. She simply held up a second hat, this one a fluffy white beanie that looked like it belonged on a toddler. “You should wear this. We don’t want anyone getting sick during the holiday.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at it.</span><span><br/></span><span>Then at Iryna.</span><span><br/></span><span>Then back at the hat.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s eyes widened in panic- </span><em><span>please just take it, please don’t make this awkward, please-</span></em></p><p><span>“…Thank you,” Agatha said stiffly, taking the hat like it was radioactive.</span></p><p><span>Iryna beamed. “Wonderful! Now eat something before we go. Pietro, stop stealing the pastries!”</span></p><p><span>Pietro stuck out his tongue.</span></p><p><span>Wanda let out a subtle sigh of relief and nudged Agatha gently. “That wasn’t so bad, right?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha slid her a dark look. “I am wearing a hat shaped like a sheep.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda delicately kissed her cheek while pretending to reach for the sugar. “You look very cute.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha grumbled into her mug.</span></p><p><span>It took another fifteen minutes, and three separate arguments, before anyone actually began to move toward the front door.</span></p><p><span>Monica couldn’t find her gloves.</span><span><br/></span><span>Pietro refused to leave until someone charged his phone.</span><span><br/></span><span>Marina was insisting everyone refill the bird feeder </span><em><span>right now</span></em><span> so the sparrows wouldn’t “feel abandoned.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda bounced lightly on her feet, coat zipped, scarf wrapped, ready and buzzing with manic holiday energy.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stood beside her, shoulders hunched, sipping coffee like it was holy wine, observing as Wanda’s family attempted, and failed spectacularly, to exit a single structure in an organized manner.</span></p><p><span>Billy popped up beside her suddenly.</span></p><p><span>“You look like you’re calculating how to escape.”</span></p><p><span>“I am,” Agatha replied.</span></p><p><span>Billy nodded, solemn. “If you need to fake an injury, I can fall down the stairs.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted harder than she meant to. “That is disturbingly generous.”</span></p><p><span>“I live to serve,” Billy said, saluting her with the half-eaten donut now in his hand.</span></p><p><span>Wanda called from the doorway. “Come on, you two!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha drained the last of her coffee and sighed, long and theatrical. “And so it begins.”</span></p><p><span>Billy patted her shoulder. “Welcome to small-town holiday hell.”</span></p><p><span>“Thank you, Teen,” Agatha replied.</span></p><p><span>“It’s </span><em><span>Billy,</span></em><span>” he corrected automatically.</span></p><p><span>“That’s what I said.”</span></p><p><span>His groan could be heard down the hall.</span></p><p><span>The family spilled out the door in a chaotic wave of scarves and boots and half-warmed coats. The cold morning air slapped Agatha in the face, stealing the last remnants of sleep straight out of her bones.</span></p><p><span>The yard was covered in a thin layer of snow that sparkled under the pale winter sun. The sky was a bright icy blue. The street buzzed faintly with the activity of other families also heading toward the town square.</span></p><p><span>Wanda slipped on her gloves and grinned at Agatha, her breath puffing out in little white clouds.</span></p><p><span>“Ready?”</span></p><p><span>“No.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda laughed. “Perfect.”</span></p><p><span>She linked her arm through Agatha’s, not their hands, but it was something. Enough to pull Agatha out of her gloom for the briefest moment.</span></p><p><span>They stepped off the porch together.</span></p><p><span>The whole Maximoff clan followed behind, talking over each other, stumbling toward their beloved holiday tradition.</span></p><p><span>And Agatha, dragged into the bustle, whispered under her breath:</span></p><p><span>“This town better have coffee.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda squeezed her arm. “It does. And cocoa. And cider. And-”</span></p><p><span>“Stop,” Agatha begged. “Please.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda only laughed and leaned against her for a beat, warm and familiar and unbearably sweet.</span></p><p><span>An absurd scavenger hunt awaited them. And Agatha, grumpy, tired, already overwhelmed, walked into it anyway.</span></p><p><span>Because Wanda asked.</span></p><p><span>Because Wanda wanted.</span></p><p><span>Because Wanda was trying.</span></p><p><span>---</span></p><p><span>Snow powdered the edges of the town square like someone had lightly sifted sugar over a gingerbread diorama. People were already bustling between booths, clutching thermoses and clipboards, kids weaving between adults in puffy coats that squeaked when they ran. Wanda tugged Agatha forward through the crowd, cheeks pink from the cold, her excitement vibrating through the air in a way Agatha both admired and found vaguely exhausting this early in the morning.</span></p><p><span>The mayor, an overly enthusiastic man in a plaid scarf, stepped up onto the small wooden stage that normally hosted summer concerts. He tapped the microphone twice, sending a metallic ping through the square.</span></p><p><span>“Good morning, Westview!” he bellowed. The crowd roared back. Agatha winced. “Welcome, one and all, to our </span><em><span>Annual Christmas Scavenger Hunt</span></em><span>! Remember, teamwork makes the magic happen! You and your partner must find all five clues hidden throughout town. First pair back gets bragging rights for the entire year!”</span></p><p><span>A chorus of cheers rose. Wanda clapped. Agatha shoved her hands deeper into her coat pockets and muttered, “Bragging rights. The prize of champions.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda elbowed her, whispering, “We don’t have to win. But it’ll be fun.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha gave her a flat look that she hoped conveyed exactly how unlikely she found that. But Wanda only beamed at her like Agatha’s skepticism was a treasured personality trait.</span></p><p><span>“Now then!” the mayor continued. “Please- pair off!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha instinctively reached toward Wanda, just as Pietro swooped in like a hawk spotting prey.</span></p><p><span>“Dibs!” he shouted, grabbing Wanda's </span><span>wrist.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes widened. “I- no- hang on-”</span></p><p><span>“Yes! Twin duo!” Pietro crowed, slinging an arm around her shoulders before she could sidestep him. “Our reputation precedes us.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shot Wanda a wide-eyed look of pure panic.</span></p><p><span>Wanda, unfortunately, did not look panicked. She looked amused. “You’ll be fine,” she mouthed, then added aloud, “Pietro, she might not want-”</span></p><p><span>Too late. Pietro was already dragging Wanda toward the table where volunteers were handing out clue sheets.</span></p><p><span>“Hey,” Rio said.</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned, and her breath stalled just a little. Rio stood there bundled in a dark green coat with her hair pulled back under a beanie, soft curls escaping around her face. Her cheeks were pink from the cold, her eyes bright with the kind of enthusiasm Agatha usually associated with puppies or preteens meeting Santa.</span></p><p><span>“I was wondering if you needed a partner,” Rio said, a small, hopeful smile tugging at her mouth.</span></p><p><span>“I am not your best pick,” Agatha muttered.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s smile warmed. “We don’t have to win or anything. I just… thought it’d be fun.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha opened her mouth to object, to point out she wasn’t exactly the </span><em><span>festivities</span></em><span> type, especially not for a girl who smelled like peppermint chapstick and confidence, but her throat tightened on the words.</span></p><p><span>Because even in the crowded square, even with a brass band warming up in the background and Wanda watching her with a knowing expression…</span></p><p><span>Rio felt like a point of quiet gravity. A steadying pull. A place she could stand and breathe.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” Agatha said before she could talk herself out of it. “Yeah. Sure. Partner.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes lit up. “Really?”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t make me regret this.”</span></p><p><span>“I won’t.” Rio’s grin was immediate, earnest, and devastating. “Promise.”</span></p><p><span>Pietro whistled. “Well. This is going in the family group chat. Mother will be thrilled.”</span></p><p><span>“Go away,” Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>He saluted and disappeared into the crowd.</span></p><p><span>Rio held out one of the laminated clue lists. “We get our own copy. Which is good, because I am taking this very seriously.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes, I can see that,” Agatha drawled, glancing at the thick gloves and the little pen tucked behind Rio’s ear. “You look like you’re about to enter a survivalist competition.”</span></p><p><span>“It is </span><em><span>tradition</span></em><span>,” Rio corrected, mock-offended. “And also, I like winning.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha hummed. “I don’t.”</span></p><p><span>Rio flashed her a playful look. “Then it balances out. We make a great team.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha resisted the urge to hide her face in her scarf.</span></p><p><span>The mayor blew a whistle. “Everyone ready?”</span></p><p><span>Rio bounced once on her heels.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at her. “You’re really into this.”</span></p><p><span>“I love Christmas,” Rio said without apology. “All of it. Every ridiculous, sparkly, cheesy part. I used to do this scavenger hunt every year with Wanda when we were kids.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. “With Wanda?”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah.” Rio’s expression softened. “She was always so determined to beat Pietro. And I- well- I liked being with her. It was fun.” She paused, then added, “I hope this is fun for you, too.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s stomach dipped, caught between jealousy she didn’t want to name and a warm tug of affection she definitely didn’t want to name.</span></p><p><span>She blew out a breath. “I’ll tolerate it.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed. “High praise.”</span></p><p><span>The mayor raised both arms. “Three… two… ONE- GO!”</span></p><p><span>The square exploded into movement. Adults launched into competitive speed-walking. Kids sprinted past with shrieks of glee. Someone dropped a thermos that rolled under a hot cocoa booth.</span></p><p><span>Rio grabbed Agatha’s mittened hand, not forcefully, just quick and instinctive. “Come on! First clue!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t protest. Not because she was too stunned by the warmth of Rio’s hand or because it fit too easily around hers- no, that would be ridiculous.</span></p><p><span>She just didn’t want to lose her in the crowd. That was all.</span></p><p><span>Rio pulled them toward a bench under the giant town Christmas tree. She unfolded the list.</span></p><p><span>“Number one!” Rio announced like a television host. “‘Find the ornament that doesn’t belong.’”</span></p><p><span>Agatha raised a brow. “Describe ‘doesn’t belong.’ Because this town has already proven it has no shame.”</span></p><p><span>Rio snorted and pointed. “Look. Every ornament is red or gold. Except…” She scanned upward, then grinned triumphantly. “There! A silver one!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha sighed dramatically. “We are starting with a seek-and-find puzzle. Excellent.”</span></p><p><span>But Rio looked so proud of herself, so earnestly delighted, that something in Agatha’s chest unspooled.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stepped closer to the tree, pretending to inspect branches. “Should I climb it? Is that allowed? That feels illegal.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed. “No the clue is probably tucked somewhere lower.” She lifted o her tiptoes looking for it. “Boom. Next clue found.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re frighteningly competent at this.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s my one seasonal skill.”</span></p><p><span>They moved on through the square, weaving between booths. Rio narrated clues with excited commentary; Agatha responded with dry retorts, each one earning a laugh that felt far too rewarding.</span></p><p><span>“Second clue,” Rio said. “‘Locate the snowman with the wrong accessory.’”</span></p><p><span>They passed three snowmen. One had sunglasses. One had a feather boa. The third had… a bright orange traffic cone for a hat.</span></p><p><span>“There.” Agatha pointed. “The one experiencing a midlife crisis.”</span></p><p><span>Rio giggled. “You’re really good at this.”</span></p><p><span>“I resent that.”</span></p><p><span>“No you don’t,” Rio murmured, bumping her shoulder lightly into Agatha’s.</span></p><p><span>Agatha pretended she didn’t notice the warmth that shot up her spine.</span></p><p><span>They collected clues, snapping photos, jotting notes. Rio stopped to compliment a child’s scarf. Agatha critiqued a snow sculpture as “emotionally overworked.” Rio snorted so hard she choked. Agatha thumped her on the back and pretended it wasn’t fond.</span></p><p><span>Somewhere between clue two and a child almost knocking over a bunch of decorations, while Rio was explaining the strategy of checking near the gazebo for hidden markers, Agatha realized something unsettling:</span></p><p><span>She was having fun.</span></p><p><span>Actual, genuine, </span><em><span>fun.</span></em></p><p><span>She tried to cover it by grumbling, “You’re too energetic,” as Rio dragged her toward the next station.</span></p><p><span>Rio only smiled, bright as the string lights overhead. “Yeah, but you like it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha sputtered. “I tolerate it.”</span></p><p><span>“Mm-hmm.”</span></p><p><span>But Rio wasn’t teasing exactly. More… observing. Seeing her. Understanding her. And Agatha had the alarming instinct to look away before that soft gaze could unravel anything else inside her.</span></p><p><span>Instead she shoved her hands deeper into her pockets. “What’s the next clue before I revoke your bragging rights?”</span></p><p><span>Rio looked down at the list. “The nativity scene outside the church. Something there is ‘unexpected.’”</span></p><p><span>Agatha groaned. “Please tell me it’s not a live donkey.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s grin turned wicked. “Only one way to find out.”</span></p><p><span>She reached for Agatha’s hand again- this time slower, more deliberate.</span></p><p><span>Agatha let her.</span></p><p><span>Not because she needed to.</span></p><p><span>But because she wanted to.</span></p><p><span>They fell into step together, the crowd thinning as the rest of the teams rushed toward the church. Snow drifted lazily from the wide December sky, settling on Rio’s hair, dark curls catching the light like threads of ink dusted with stars. She tugged Agatha along, half-skipping as though she wasn’t a grown adult but a kid who had gotten exactly what she wanted for Christmas.</span></p><p><span>“It’s unsettling how chipper you are about this scavenger hunt,” Agatha muttered.</span></p><p><span>Rio beamed back at her. “This is one of the best events of the year, sorry that you’re joy-deficient.”</span></p><p><span>“I am not joy-deficient,” Agatha countered. “I just prefer my festivities indoors. Preferably with alcohol.”</span></p><p><span>“Noted,” Rio laughed. “After we win, drinks are on me.”</span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>If</span></em><span> we win,” Agatha corrected sharply.</span></p><p><span>“When,” Rio corrected right back.</span></p><p><span>They pushed through the cluster of people hovering near the nativity display in front of St. Matthew’s. It was the same tiny scene Agatha remembered from childhood, wooden cutouts of Mary and Joseph, a plywood barn, a plastic baby Jesus whose head was perpetually too large for his body.</span></p><p><span>But something </span><em><span>was</span></em><span> different.</span></p><p><span>Rio let out a sudden bark of laughter. “Oh my god. Look at the shepherd.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stepped closer. Sure enough, one of the shepherds, usually painted in drab brown and carrying a sheep, had been replaced with…someone wearing a full Santa suit. Hat, beard, sack and all.</span></p><p><span>“I’m going to guess this was not part of the biblical narrative,” Agatha deadpanned.</span></p><p><span>Rio reached inside the folds of the Santa-shepherd’s coat and pulled out a small laminated card. “‘Clue four: Find something warm enough to melt even the coldest winter.’”</span></p><p><span>“That is aggressively vague,” Agatha muttered.</span></p><p><span>Rio nudged her hip. “You’re the Christmas cynic. What do </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> think it means?”</span></p><p><span>“Mistletoe?” Agatha guessed. “Hot chocolate? A space heater?”</span></p><p><span>Rio grinned. “Or…” She gestured dramatically around the square.</span></p><p><span>“Oh absolutely don’t say it.”</span></p><p><span>“Love!” Rio declared with tragic sincerity.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at her. “I can’t believe you just willingly said that out loud in public.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed so hard she snorted, and the sound pushed something warm through Agatha’s chest, a small glow she pretended not to feel.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” Rio said, clearing her throat. “What about the bakery booth? They have mulled cider.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s not warm enough to melt anything.”</span></p><p><span>“Have you ever had their cider? It changed my life at seven.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha bit down a smile. “Fine. Lead the way, childhood nostalgia.”</span></p><p><span>The bakery booth was easy to find, its striped canopy puffing steam into the cold air, the scent of cinnamon rolling out like a warm blanket. Rio dragged her straight into the line, bouncing on her toes like she was vibrating with holiday spirit.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tried not to stare. Tried not to notice the little things: the pink on Rio’s cheeks from the cold, the spark in her eyes, the way she kept brushing their shoulders together like she needed the contact.</span></p><p><span>When they reached the front, Rio paid before Agatha could argue and pushed a steaming cup into her hands.</span></p><p><span>“Drink,” Rio ordered.</span></p><p><span>Agatha held the cup to her face, inhaling deeply. “Fine,” she murmured, taking a sip.</span></p><p><span>A burst of heat, spice, apple, and warmth hit her tongue.</span></p><p><span>“Oh,” she breathed. “Okay. That’s…shockingly good.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked triumphantly. “Warm enough?”</span></p><p><span>“Fine. It’s warm.” Agatha took another sip. “But probably not our clue.”</span></p><p><span>Rio scanned the square again. “Let’s think. Something warm enough to melt winter. What does that even- oh.”</span></p><p><span>She pointed behind Agatha.</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned, and groaned.</span></p><p><span>The mistletoe stand.</span></p><p><span>“Absolutely not,” Agatha said immediately.</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed. “Relax, you don’t have to kiss me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha absolutely did not look relieved by that, and she very much hoped it didn’t show.</span></p><p><span>They went over, and sure enough, dangling beneath the largest mistletoe bunch was a ribbon-tied envelope.</span></p><p><span>Clue five.</span></p><p><span>Rio opened it. “‘Find the shadow that never grows.’”</span></p><p><span>“…what?” Agatha blinked.</span></p><p><span>Rio brightened. “The big wooden sundial in the town garden! In winter it barely casts anything!”</span></p><p><span>“You sound disturbingly confident.”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha, this is my Super Bowl.”</span></p><p><span>She reached for her hand again.</span></p><p><span>This time Agatha didn’t just let her, she curled her fingers back.</span></p><p><span>They trudged through the lightly falling snow toward the garden path, Rio animatedly rambling about how she and Pietro once cheated in the scavenger hunt by hiding three clues and Wanda ratted them out within five minutes.</span></p><p><span>Agatha pretended to listen with exasperation.</span></p><p><span>But she was smiling.</span></p><p><span>Actually smiling.</span></p><p><span>And when Rio noticed and bumped her shoulder with a soft, “See? You’re having fun,” Agatha only rolled her eyes, notably without denying it.</span></p><p><span>The sundial stood in the center of the icy garden, surrounded by benches dusted white. A string of faint holiday lights looped overhead, their early-evening glow starting to flicker on.</span></p><p><span>Rio spotted the next clue first, wedged between the sundial’s wooden base and the soil.</span></p><p><span>She knelt to retrieve it, her breath fogging in the cold.</span></p><p><span>“‘Final task,’” she read. “‘Bring back a token that represents teamwork.’”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted. “That’s even vaguer than the warm thing.”</span></p><p><span>Rio looked around, thinking hard.</span></p><p><span>Agatha did too, even if she wouldn’t admit she was invested.</span></p><p><span>Couples and families scurried across the square, holding hands, laughing, weaving between booths. Kids made snowballs, parents posed for pictures. Every direction held sentimentality, togetherness, cliché seasonal sweetness.</span></p><p><span>Ugh.</span></p><p><span>Until her eyes landed on something.</span></p><p><span>“Hey,” she said, pointing to the old wishing well on the edge of the garden. “Does that count?”</span></p><p><span>Rio followed her gaze. “A well?”</span></p><p><span>“It’s where people make wishes together. Symbolic enough.”</span></p><p><span>Rio grinned. “God, you’re such a secret romantic.”</span></p><p><span>“I will abandon you in the snow.”</span></p><p><span>But they headed toward it anyway, passing a little boy struggling to reach the coin slot atop the well. Agatha scooped him up without thinking, lifting him just high enough to drop the penny in. His mother thanked her before rushing off.</span></p><p><span>Rio stared at her like she had witnessed a miracle.</span></p><p><span>“I am nice to children,” Agatha snapped.</span></p><p><span>Rio lifted both eyebrows. “I didn’t say anything.”</span></p><p><span>“You didn’t have to.”</span></p><p><span>But Rio was smiling softly. Warmly. Like she’d just seen another piece of Agatha no one else usually got.</span></p><p><span>The token was simple, a little wooden star glued to the side of the well. They pried it free and headed back to the mayor’s booth.</span></p><p><span>By then the square was buzzing with finishing teams, some triumphant, some thoroughly lost.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned in. “Okay. If we win, you owe me another cider.”</span></p><p><span>“If we win, you owe me ten minutes of silence.”</span></p><p><span>“Deal.”</span></p><p><span>They stepped up to the booth, handed over the wooden star, and waited as the mayor, who looked like he’d been doing this since Roosevelt, checked their answers.</span></p><p><span>He clapped his hands together. “Well look at that! First place!”</span></p><p><span>Rio squeaked.</span></p><p><span>Actually squeaked.</span></p><p><span>Then she turned to Agatha and, before Agatha could react, grabbed her around the waist, hoisting her off the ground in a tight, startled hug.</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze.</span></p><p><span>Completely froze.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s arms were strong, warm, firm around her. Her breath brushed against Agatha’s cheek. Her laugh rumbled against Agatha’s chest. And for a second, just one second, all the icy walls Agatha had carefully stacked around herself cracked.</span></p><p><span>She relaxed into the embrace.</span></p><p><span>Just slightly.</span></p><p><span>Just enough to feel how good it felt.</span></p><p><span>How safe.</span></p><p><span>How…right.</span></p><p><span>Then Wanda’s voice cut through the air.</span></p><p><span>“Oh my god, you two won?”</span></p><p><span>Rio set Agatha down immediately, as though burned.</span></p><p><span>Wanda slipped between them with a bright, too-wide smile, pulling Agatha close by the arm.</span></p><p><span>“Of course you did,” Wanda said, her eyes flicking toward Rio a second too long. “Pietro and I were so close.”</span></p><p><span>“I beat you,” Agatha replied automatically.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s smile twitched. “Barely.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped back, smile dimming just a hair, though she tried to cover it with a joking, “Well, team effort!”</span></p><p><span>Wanda looped her arm fully through Agatha’s. “We should get back to my family. Dinner’s in an hour and they already think we disappeared.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt the shift, the tension tightening like a thread between all three of them. Wanda tugging. Rio stepping back. Agatha stuck in the middle with her heart doing entirely too much.</span></p><p><span>Rio gave a small wave. “Congrats again. Really. You were a good partner.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed. “You too.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda whisked her away before anything else could be said, her hand warm on Agatha’s back, guiding her firmly toward the center of town.</span></p><p><span>Agatha glanced over her shoulder.</span></p><p><span>Rio was still watching her.</span></p><p><span>Not smiling. Not sad. Just…watching.</span></p><p><span>Like she was trying to memorize something she wasn’t supposed to hold on to.</span></p><p><span>Wanda nudged her. “Come on. You can bask in your victory later.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha faced forward again, letting Wanda lead her through the square’s glittering lights, its laughter, its music, its warmth.</span></p><p><span>But behind her ribs?</span></p><p><span>Something new had started to glow.</span></p><p><span>Something she didn’t quite know how to name.</span></p><p><span>Something she wasn’t sure she wanted to lose.</span></p><p><span>And that was exactly why it terrified her.</span></p><p><span>The three of them, Agatha between Wanda and Rio, caught in an invisible triangle of tension, history, and something unfolding, walked off into the flickering holiday lights.</span></p>

<p><span>By the time evening settled over Westview, the adrenaline of the scavenger hunt had drained from Agatha’s system, leaving behind a strange mixture of contentment and discomfort. Winning with Rio had been, if she was being honest, fun. More fun than she’d expected. More fun than she </span><em><span>should’ve</span></em><span> had.</span></p><p><span>But Wanda hadn’t spoken about it since.</span></p><p><span>Not in the car ride home. Not when they changed out of their cold, snow-damp clothes. Not while the whole family lounged in the living room watching some saccharine Hallmark holiday marathon.</span></p><p><span>She was smiling at Agatha, touching her knee, laughing at her jokes.</span></p><p><span>But she hadn’t mentioned anything about their day.</span></p><p><span>Which made the knot in Agatha’s chest tighten.</span></p><p><span>So when Wanda knocked on her bedroom door just after six, poking her head in with hair curled and lipstick on, Agatha sat up straight.</span></p><p><span>“Going anywhere festive?” Agatha asked, already suspicious.</span></p><p><span>Wanda smiled brightly. “Alice and Jen want to get drinks downtown. They’re already out, and we thought you might want to join?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. “Me?”</span></p><p><span>“Yes, you,” Wanda said, stepping fully inside. “Unless you want to stay here with my father while he reorganizes the nativity figurines. Again.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shuddered. “What time are we leaving?”</span></p><p><span>---</span></p><p><span>The bar was already buzzing when they walked in, warm lights, exposed brick, live music humming low under the conversations. It was the kind of place Agatha might actually like if she wasn’t currently bracing to meet Wanda’s childhood best friends, who, judging by the way Wanda kept smoothing down her coat, made her nervous.</span></p><p><span>Alice spotted them first, waving from a high-top table near the window.</span></p><p><span>Jen didn’t wave- just lifted her beer and gave Agatha a look that screamed </span><em><span>Oh. So this is the new roommate.</span></em></p><p><span>“Hi!” Wanda chirped, sliding into the seat beside Alice. “You remember Jen, right? And Alice.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha took the only remaining seat between Jen and Wanda.</span></p><p><span>Jen smiled tightly. “So. Roommate, huh? Wanda said you two met in the city.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded. “Yep. Very normal, very standard, completely non-chaotic roommate origin story.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda kicked her under the table.</span></p><p><span>Alice lifted a brow. “Are you two already fighting? That was fast.”</span></p><p><span>“Not fighting,” Wanda insisted quickly, shaking her head in a way that made her earrings sway. “Just…bantering.”</span></p><p><span>Jen took a sip of her drink, still watching Agatha. “You from around here?”</span></p><p><span>“God, no,” Agatha replied immediately. “I like my privacy. And my neighbors not knowing my blood type.”</span></p><p><span>Alice laughed. Wanda made a small distressed sound. Jen’s eyes narrowed.</span></p><p><span>“So you’re…what? Just staying with Wanda for the holidays?” Jen asked.</span></p><p><span>“Yep,” Wanda said too quickly. “She needed a place to go, and I had a place.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at her drink. Something about the phrasing made her teeth grit.</span></p><p><span>Jen hummed. “And what do you do, Agatha?”</span></p><p><span>“I work for a university,” Agatha said, waving her hand vaguely. “Research grants. Proposals. Taming the occasional prepubescent adult going through an existential crisis.”</span></p><p><span>Jen smirked. “How…practical.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smiled sweetly. “Oh absolutely. I try to keep it functional. You know, like your shirt.”</span></p><p><span>Jen froze. Alice choked on her margarita. Wanda buried her face in her hands.</span></p><p><span>“It’s vintage,” Jen huffed.</span></p><p><span>“I can tell,” Agatha said. “It looks like it’s been through several wars.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda, still blushing furiously, reached for Agatha’s arm. “She’s kidding. She’s </span><em><span>kidding,</span></em><span> right?”</span></p><p><span>“Of course,” Agatha said with a slow sip of her cocktail. “Mostly.”</span></p><p><span>Alice burst out laughing.</span></p><p><span>Jen didn’t.</span></p><p><span>“So,” Jen tried again, turning her attention pointedly back to Wanda, “any updates on work? You mentioned maybe applying for that position at the museum?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda sat up straighter, relief settling over her shoulders as the attention shifted. “Yeah! I’m still working on the application. Just waiting on one letter of recommendation.”</span></p><p><span>Alice nudged her. “And are you ever going to tell us how </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> ended up with a roommate this close to Christmas? You didn’t even tell us you were looking for one.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha waited.</span></p><p><span>Wanda hesitated.</span></p><p><span>Then said far too brightly, “We just…clicked? She needed a place, and I hate living alone, so it worked.”</span></p><p><span>Jen’s eyes darted between them, suspicious. “Right. Because Wanda’s never done anything impulsive in her life.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha traced the rim of her glass, ignoring the small sting in her chest. Roommate. Just roommate. Not even a hint of disappointment in Wanda’s voice about saying it.</span></p><p><span>Fine.</span></p><p><span>She could play the part.</span></p><p><span>“That’s me,” Agatha said with a dry smile. “Totally impulsive decision for totally normal roommate reasons.”</span></p><p><span>Jen snorted. “Do your roommates usually follow you home for the holidays?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t blink. “Only the special ones.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda nearly spit out her drink.</span></p><p><span>Alice leaned in toward Jen. “Stop, you’re antagonizing her.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m not antagonizing,” Jen protested. “I’m evaluating.”</span></p><p><span>“Evaluating what?” Agatha asked, arching a brow.</span></p><p><span>Jen shrugged. “Whether you’re a long-term fixture or a seasonal…decoration.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s lips curled. “Oh sweetheart. If I were temporary, you’d be much nicer to me.”</span></p><p><span>Alice clapped her hands over her mouth to smother a laugh.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s head dropped to the table with a groan. “Please. Please behave.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked. Jen glared. Alice ordered another round.</span></p><p><span>Over the next hour, drinks flowed and the conversation loosened, though the tension never fully dissipated. Every time Alice asked a question, Wanda jumped in too quickly. Every time Jen poked at Agatha, Wanda kicked her under the table.</span></p><p><span>“Remember when Wanda tried to dye her hair blonde freshman year?” Alice laughed. “It turned out orange.”</span></p><p><span>“Hey!” Wanda protested. “It was auburn.”</span></p><p><span>“It was citrus,” Jen corrected.</span></p><p><span>“I think it was brave,” Agatha said, swirling her drink. “At least she commits to something once in a while.”</span></p><p><span>Jen’s eyes gleamed. “Does she?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda groaned into her hands again. “I hate this. I hate all of you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha couldn’t help smiling. “No you don’t.”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Wanda admitted quietly, shooting her a small, fond look. “I don’t.”</span></p><p><span>And something warm settled in Agatha’s stomach. Something stupid. Something dangerous.</span></p><p><span>Alice caught the look, blinked, but said nothing.</span></p><p><span>Jen caught it too.</span></p><p><span>And narrowed her eyes.</span></p><p><span>“So,” Jen said abruptly, leaning forward, “you two must really get along as roommates, huh?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda stiffened. “Yes! Totally fine! Great! Normal.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha took a slow sip of her drink. “We don’t kill each other. It’s a success.”</span></p><p><span>Jen’s lips twitched. “Uh-huh. And Wanda? When exactly were you planning to tell us you have someone staying with you for-” she waved her hand-“however long?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda swallowed. “I was going to tell you. I just…didn’t want to make a big deal.”</span></p><p><span>Jen’s gaze sharpened. “Right. Because it’s not a big deal.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s cheeks flushed. “It’s really not.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt the words like a pinprick under her ribs.</span></p><p><span>Of course it wasn’t a big deal. Because if it were, Wanda would’ve said the truth.</span></p><p><span>She held her tongue.</span></p><p><span>Barely.</span></p><p><span>When the next round arrived, Alice finally tried to lighten the mood. “Okay okay, enough tension. Wanda, tell Agatha about the time you accidentally hit the pastor with a snowball.”</span></p><p><span>“I am not telling that story,” Wanda said firmly.</span></p><p><span>“I’ll tell it,” Jen offered.</span></p><p><span>“You absolutely will not,” Wanda snapped.</span></p><p><span>But the awkwardness broke. Alice giggled. Jen smirked. Wanda groaned.</span></p><p><span>Even Agatha let out a reluctant laugh.</span></p><p><span>For a moment- just a moment- they all seemed…normal.</span></p><p><span>Mostly.</span></p><p><span>Eventually, Alice excused herself to the bathroom. Jen left to play a round of pool with some group in the back. Wanda leaned against the table with a long breath.</span></p><p><span>“That went…okay,” Wanda said weakly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Okay?”</span></p><p><span>“They like you,” Wanda insisted. “They’re just…protective.”</span></p><p><span>“Of you,” Agatha said quietly.</span></p><p><span>Wanda met her eyes.</span></p><p><span>Neither looked away.</span></p><p><span>“They don’t dislike you,” Wanda repeated, softer this time. “Jen just has a sharp tongue.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh trust me,” Agatha murmured, “I noticed.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda nudged her shoulder. “Thank you for coming. Really. I know small-town friend groups aren’t exactly your favorite.”</span></p><p><span>“You owe me a drink,” Agatha said. “And probably your firstborn.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda grinned. “Deal.”</span></p><p><span>They sat in the noisy, warm bar, Wanda leaning in toward Agatha like she always did when no one was watching too closely. Like gravity tugged her that direction. Like she forgot, for a moment, that she’d introduced Agatha as a </span><em><span>roommate</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Wanda was mid-sip of her drink when her spine went rigid.</span></p><p><span>Not just stiff- </span><em><span>alert.</span></em><em><span><br/></span></em><span>Like a deer catching the snap of a distant twig.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt the change before she understood it. Wanda’s hand, resting near Agatha’s on the table, curled inward. Her gaze snapped toward the front of the bar, face going pale beneath her blush.</span></p><p><span>Agatha followed the line of Wanda’s eyes.</span></p><p><span>A tall man had just walked in, dark coat, clean posture, blond hair combed too perfectly for a casual night out. He scanned the room with practiced warmth, as if he expected every stranger to greet him like an old friend.</span></p><p><span>And Wanda looked like she might either faint or vault over the table.</span></p><p><span>The man saw them.</span></p><p><span>His face lit up.</span></p><p><span>“Oh no,” Agatha muttered into her drink.</span></p><p><span>He approached with the effortless confidence of a person who had never questioned whether he belonged somewhere.</span></p><p><span>“Wanda,” he said warmly, voice smooth and annoyingly pleasant. “I thought that was you.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda let out a bright, high-pitched “Hi!” that did not belong to the woman Agatha lived with. “Vision! Oh my God- hi. Hi.”</span></p><p><span>Vision.</span></p><p><em><span>That</span></em><span> Vision.</span></p><p><span>The one Wanda had mentioned exactly once, in a strained half-sentence she’d quickly diverted with a joke. The one who had clearly mattered in a way she refused to examine now.</span></p><p><span>Vision smiled politely at the table, but his eyes remained firmly on Wanda.</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t expect to run into you here,” he said.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah! Yeah, well- we’re just out for drinks,” Wanda said, clasping her hands too tightly in front of her. She gestured between them with forced casualness. “Um- this is Agatha. My… roommate.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt the word like a slap.</span></p><p><span>Vision offered a handshake. “Pleasure. I’ve heard a bit about you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook his hand because she had self-control. “Same.”</span></p><p><span>He nodded, looked back at Wanda, and something soft passed through his expression. Familiar. Easy. Like slipping into an old shape.</span></p><p><span>“I’ll let you get back to your evening,” he said gently. “I’m just going to grab a drink.”</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” Wanda said a little too quickly. “Um. Enjoy.”</span></p><p><span>He stepped away toward the bar.</span></p><p><span>Before Agatha could open her mouth to ask the question rising like smoke in her chest, two bodies slammed into the table.</span></p><p><span>Alice and Jen.</span></p><p><span>Both breathless.</span></p><p><span>Both starry-eyed.</span></p><p><span>Both radiating chaotic, gossip-hungry energy.</span></p><p><span>“Oh. My. God,” Alice hissed. “Wanda Maximoff, you did </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> tell us Vision was back in town!”</span></p><p><span>Jen didn’t even try to be subtle. She grabbed Wanda’s arm. “When did he get here? When did you know? Why didn’t you say something?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda blinked rapidly. “He- he just walked in. I didn’t-”</span></p><p><span>Alice practically squealed, looking at Agatha as though she’d just discovered treasure. “That was </span><em><span>Vision.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared. “Yes. I gathered.”</span></p><p><span>Jen leaned in. “No, you don’t understand. Vision and Wanda were-” she clasped her hands dramatically- “the couple.”</span></p><p><span>Alice nodded vigorously. “High school sweethearts. College sweethearts. Practically Westview royalty.”</span></p><p><span>“They were everyone’s relationship goals,” Jen added.</span></p><p><span>Agatha lifted a brow. “Sounds nauseating.”</span></p><p><span>Alice shook her head. “They were </span><em><span>perfect</span></em><span> together.”</span></p><p><span>“And everyone thought they’d get married,” Jen said, eyes sparkling. “Everyone.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s stomach tightened into a knot so sharp she almost winced.</span></p><p><span>Everyone.</span></p><p><span>Wanda wasn’t rushing to correct them.</span></p><p><span>That was worse.</span></p><p><span>Alice spotted Vision ordering at the bar and immediately began waving like she was flagging a plane on a runway. “Vision! Come join us!”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Wanda said instantly.</span></p><p><span>“Yes,” Jen insisted.</span></p><p><span>But it was too late, Vision had already seen them and was making his way back over.</span></p><p><span>Agatha inhaled slowly through her nose. “I’m exhausted,” she announced, standing before she could talk herself out of it. “I’m heading back.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s head snapped toward her. “What? Now?”</span></p><p><span>“I’m tired,” Agatha said, keeping her voice even. “Long day. Snow. Children screaming. Rivalry with a traffic-cone snowman. I’m cooked.”</span></p><p><span>Vision reached the table just as she picked up her coat. He smiled warmly. “Heading out?”</span></p><p><span>“Yes,” Agatha said. “Enjoy your… group nostalgia summit.”</span></p><p><span>He looked confused. Wanda looked panicked.</span></p><p><span>Alice and Jen looked thrilled.</span></p><p><span>“I can walk you home,” Wanda said abruptly, half-standing.</span></p><p><span>“No,” Jen cut in, far too quickly. “Wanda should stay. We all need to catch up! It’s been forever.”</span></p><p><span>Alice nodded eagerly. “Yes! Stay! Please!”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s conflicted expression twisted something sharp in Agatha’s chest.</span></p><p><span>If Wanda wanted to say, </span><em><span>No, I’m going with her,</span></em><span> she didn’t.</span></p><p><span>Instead, Wanda swallowed.</span></p><p><span>Her eyes flicked apologetically to Agatha.</span></p><p><span>“I… I’ll be home later,” she said softly. “Is that okay?”</span></p><p><span>There it was.</span></p><p><span>Not a lie.</span><span><br/></span><span>Not a betrayal.</span><span><br/></span><span>Just a choice.</span></p><p><span>A choice with edges.</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded once. Tight. Controlled. “Of course.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s face flickered with guilt. “I’ll come back soon. I promise.”</span></p><p><span>“Take your time,” Agatha said, slipping into her coat. “Your friends are clearly very excited.”</span></p><p><span>Jen preened.</span></p><p><span>Vision smiled again, like he was part of something inevitable.</span></p><p><span>Alice giggled.</span></p><p><span>Wanda looked like she wanted to reach for Agatha but didn’t dare- not here, not now, not with the word </span><em><span>roommate</span></em><span> still hanging in the air like a curse.</span></p><p><span>So Agatha turned toward the door.</span></p><p><span>Walked out.</span></p><p><span>Did not look back.</span></p><p><span>---</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t remember dozing off. One moment she’d been lying stiffly on top of Wanda’s quilt, scrolling aimlessly on her phone, pretending she wasn’t checking the time every ninety seconds. The next, her eyes snapped open at the sound of footsteps- clumsy, uneven, accompanied by a breathy little giggle that didn’t belong to anyone else in this house.</span></p><p><span>The door eased open.</span></p><p><span>Wanda stumbled inside, one hand gripping the frame for balance. Her hair was mussed from the cold night air, cheeks flushed, mascara smudged faintly at the corners from laughing too hard or drinking too much- probably both.</span></p><p><span>Agatha pushed up on her elbows. “Wanda?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda froze.</span></p><p><span>Just- froze. Her whole body went tight, like she’d walked into the wrong room and found a ghost waiting for her. The giggliness vanished so fast Agatha wondered if she’d hallucinated it. Wanda’s eyes, glassy but sharp with some emotion she couldn’t immediately name, latched onto her.</span></p><p><span>“Oh,” she said. Not warm. Not relieved. Something closer to startled…and guilty. “You’re- here.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked at her. “Yeah. Kind of hard to miss, considering I’m literally in your bed.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s jaw flexed. She shut the door behind her, maybe too slowly, maybe too deliberately. “Why are you in my room?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha frowned. “Nice to see you too.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s not- Agatha, this is my night for the bed. You were supposed to be on the couch.” Wanda moved toward her, the scents of the bar clinging to her, gin, lime, someone’s perfume from leaning too close.</span></p><p><span>“I know whose night it was,” Agatha said, sliding fully upright now. “You were just out so late I figured you’d either crash at Alice’s or pass out in the hallway, so I took the bed until you got back.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s face pinched. “I wasn’t that late.”</span></p><p><span>“You weren’t here,” Agatha said simply.</span></p><p><span>Wanda tossed her bag on the dresser. The strap missed and the bag fell to the floor with a soft thud. She muttered something under her breath and crouched, far less gracefully than usual, to pick it up. “You didn’t have to wait up.”</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t,” Agatha said, “but I did need to sleep, so. Bed.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda straightened, wobbling just slightly. “The couch was right there.”</span></p><p><span>“I know where the couch is,” Agatha replied. “And it’s lumpy as hell, and it eats spines for breakfast. I thought I’d take the bed until you came back and then switch.”</span></p><p><span>“So switch.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at her. “You want me to go down there now?”</span></p><p><span>“Yes.” Wanda folded her arms, like crossing them could keep her whole body from swaying. “It’s my night.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re drunk,” Agatha said, gentler than she expected.</span></p><p><span>That hit something.</span></p><p><span>Wanda bristled instantly, shoulders squaring, eyes flashing with old wounds that had nothing to do with Agatha and everything to do with people who once made Wanda feel small. “I’m not drunk. I had- three drinks. Maybe four.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re drunk,” Agatha repeated, still soft.</span></p><p><span>Wanda scoffed, the sound brittle. “And you’re in my bed.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a long breath through her nose. She didn’t want this fight. God, she really didn’t. Not after the scavenger hunt, after the quiet moments, after letting herself hope things were shifting in some direction that wasn’t…whatever this was.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” Agatha said finally, pushing the quilt aside. “I’ll go.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda blinked quickly, twice, like she didn’t expect Agatha to agree so fast. Her voice, when she spoke, wob­bled. “Good.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stood, pulling her sweater straight. Her bones ached with the beginnings of exhaustion and disappointment. “You want to tell me why you came in looking like you’d seen a crime scene?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s throat worked. “I didn’t.”</span></p><p><span>“You did.”</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t,” she snapped.</span></p><p><span>Agatha dragged a hand through her hair. “Fine. Whatever. How was your night?”</span></p><p><span>A beat.</span></p><p><span>Wanda looked away. “Great.”</span></p><p><span>That wasn’t the truth. Agatha could read Wanda’s lies now, the way the woman’s mouth twitched downward at the last second, the way she couldn’t meet her eyes when she felt guilty.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” Agatha murmured. “Good.”</span></p><p><span>She moved toward the door.</span></p><p><span>Wanda spoke quickly, the words tumbling out too fast to be fully sober. “You left early.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stopped, hand hovering over the doorknob. “Yeah.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda flinched, barely but noticeably. “You should’ve stayed.”</span></p><p><span>“You told me to go,” Agatha reminded her, refusing to raise her voice. “You said you wanted to stay with your friends and catch up.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s eyes flicked up to hers, a rush of emotion swirling there: hurt, confusion, regret. “I didn’t think you’d actually leave.”</span></p><p><span>“What was I supposed to do, Wanda? Sit there while they told me how perfect you and Vision were?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda froze again.</span></p><p><span>There it was, the truth of it. The thing she’d been carrying back from the bar like a weight slung over her shoulder.</span></p><p><span>“I’m sorry you had to hear that,” Wanda whispered.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah well,” Agatha said, trying not to let bitterness seep in. It still did. “They were basically fangirling over your ex-boyfriend.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda closed her eyes, pressing her fingers briefly to her temple. “I didn’t ask them to do that.”</span></p><p><span>“I know,” Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>“But you left.”</span></p><p><span>“Because you…looked like you wanted to stay,” Agatha admitted quietly. “With them. With him.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s eyes snapped open. “I didn’t- what? Agatha, no-”</span></p><p><span>“It’s fine,” Agatha said quickly, even though it wasn’t. “You don’t owe me anything. We’re just…whatever we are. And you didn’t tell them about us, so-”</span></p><p><span>“They don’t need to know yet,” Wanda interrupted, too sharp, too defensive.</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded once. The room felt suddenly too warm. Too tight. “Right.”</span></p><p><span>Another silence.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s face fell a little when she realized her own tone. “I didn’t mean that like- Agatha, wait-”</span></p><p><span>But Agatha was already stepping out into the hallway.</span></p><p><span>“Goodnight, Wanda.”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t turn around. “Sleep it off.”</span></p><p><span>She didn’t wait to see Wanda’s reaction. She stepped out into the hallway, pulling the door closed behind her with a soft click. The upstairs landing was dim, lit only by the faint glow of the bathroom nightlight down the hall. Agatha’s pulse thudded a little too loud in her ears, anger, embarrassment, hurt twisting together in a tight knot she didn’t have the energy to untangle.</span></p><p><span>She took a slow step down the hall.</span></p><p><span>The wood creaked.</span></p><p><span>And instead of just walking like a normal human being who lived here (temporarily, but still), she started…creeping.</span></p><p><span>Creeping.</span></p><p><span>Down a familiar hallway. In the dark. As if she were sneaking out of a crime scene.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” she muttered under her breath. “Why am I like this?”</span></p><p><span>There was absolutely no reason to tiptoe. No one had told her she couldn’t be up. She wasn’t doing anything wrong. The only person who would care was already too drunk and too mad at her to pay attention.</span></p><p><span>And yet- she kept moving quietly, shoulders hunched, steps light.</span></p><p><span>Halfway to the stairs, another floorboard groaned under her foot.</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze.</span></p><p><span>Footsteps sounded above her.</span></p><p><span>Not Wanda. Lighter. More steady. Coming from the other side of the upstairs hall.</span></p><p><span>Great.</span></p><p><span>Perfect.</span></p><p><span>Exactly what she needed.</span></p><p><span>Her heart lurched, an involuntary spike of panic, like she’d been caught doing something she shouldn’t. She spun, trying to find somewhere to hide, even though she had </span><em><span>no reason whatsoever</span></em><span> to hide.</span></p><p><span>“This is ridiculous,” she whispered fiercely to herself.</span></p><p><span>The steps were getting closer.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s brain, in its infinite brilliance and self-preservation instinct, made the worst possible choice.</span></p><p><span>She reached for the nearest door and yanked it open.</span></p><p><span>A closet.</span></p><p><span>A fucking hallway closet.</span></p><p><span>Filled with coats, boxes of Christmas decorations, and what looked like three generations of mismatched umbrellas.</span></p><p><span>But the footsteps were right there and there was no time to back out, so she slipped inside like an idiot, pulled the door almost shut behind her, and tried to exist silently among the winter parkas.</span></p><p><span>“This is- seriously- what am I doing?” she breathed.</span></p><p><span>Her elbow hit a shelf.</span></p><p><span>A box wobbled.</span></p><p><span>She slapped her hand over her mouth too late.</span></p><p><span>The box tumbled off the shelf and crashed onto a pile of boots with a bang loud enough to wake the dead.</span></p><p><span>The closet door flew open.</span></p><p><span>Agatha squinted into the hall light.</span></p><p><span>Lilia stood in front of her in an oversized robe covered in little cartoon lemons, holding a mug of something steaming, and staring as if she’d discovered a raccoon in her pantry.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” she said slowly, expression caught between confusion and mild amusement. “Why are you in the closet?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked.</span></p><p><span>Opened her mouth.</span></p><p><span>Closed it.</span></p><p><span>Then, very quietly, because she genuinely had no better answer: “Sleepwalking?”</span></p><p><span>Lilia took a sip of her tea.</span></p><p><span>Still staring.</span></p><p><span>“You sleepwalk into storage spaces?” she asked gently.</span></p><p><span>“It’s a…new thing I’m trying,” Agatha said, gesturing vaguely to the mess she’d made. “Sorry for the- the avalanche.”</span></p><p><span>“Hmm.” Lilia nodded, not buying a single syllable and also not caring enough to fight it. “Well. I suppose there are worse places to wander into. Come on.”</span></p><p><span>She extended a hand.</span></p><p><span>Agatha ignored the hand and crawled out of the closet on her own, trying to regain a sliver of dignity. The crash must have been loud, because the entire house felt too silent now, the kind of silence that meant everyone else was asleep and only the two of them were standing in this ridiculous tableau.</span></p><p><span>Lilia started down the stairs, glancing back to make sure Agatha was following.</span></p><p><span>Agatha followed.</span></p><p><span>Because saying </span><em><span>no</span></em><span> to Wanda’s grandmother felt like a moral offense punishable by death.</span></p><p><span>They reached the living room, dark except for the glow of the leftover Christmas lights Wanda had forgotten to unplug. The room felt warmer than the hallway upstairs, less suffocating, but Agatha still wasn’t sure she could breathe properly.</span></p><p><span>Lilia patted the couch. “Here.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at it. “Yep. My bed.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia sat on the coffee table instead of the armchair right beside it- close enough that Agatha felt seen in a way that made her skin prickle.</span></p><p><span>“You want some tea?” Lilia asked.</span></p><p><span>“No thanks.”</span></p><p><span>“Water?”</span></p><p><span>“I’m good.”</span></p><p><span>“Warm milk?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha suppressed a grimace. “Definitely not.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia shrugged. “Worth checking.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha lowered herself onto the couch, propping the pillow behind her head, trying not to wince at the lumpy spring digging into her shoulder blade.</span></p><p><span>Lilia studied her for a long moment.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t speak.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared back.</span></p><p><span>Finally, Lilia said, “You had a strange night.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a humorless huff. “Is it that obvious?”</span></p><p><span>“You were hiding in a closet,” Lilia said matter-of-factly.</span></p><p><span>“Right. Yeah.”</span></p><p><span>She rubbed her hands over her face. She was so tired she felt hollow, but embarrassment still burned under her skin, sharp and stupid.</span></p><p><span>Lilia leaned in slightly. “Is everything okay with you and Wanda?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stiffened. “We’re- fine.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia raised an eyebrow. “Hmm.”</span></p><p><span>That </span><em><span>hmm</span></em><span> was devastatingly knowing.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tried again. “We just…had a disagreement.”</span></p><p><span>“Is that why you were creeping around like a burglar?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha groaned. “Please don’t tell her I was in the closet.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia waved a hand. “Oh, I won’t. She’d think it was symbolic.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. “Symbolic of what?”</span></p><p><span>Lilia shrugged, entirely unbothered. “Oh, I don’t know. People hide for many reasons. Taxes. Childhood shame. A poorly timed fart.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. “What?”</span></p><p><span>“So,” Lilia said lightly, “tell me what you learned tonight.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared. “Learned? I- I didn’t learn anything. I was just…at a bar.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, but bars are classrooms,” Lilia said with total confidence. “Human nature on display. Ego. Desire. Cheap tequila.”</span></p><p><span>“…What?”</span></p><p><span>Lilia held up a finger. “Lesson one: never trust a man who orders a drink with more than three ingredients. It means he’s hiding something.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked slowly. “Okay?”</span></p><p><span>“Lesson two,” Lilia continued, warming to her theme, “always choose the booth instead of the bar stool. Superior visibility. Faster exits.”</span></p><p><span>“I- sure.”</span></p><p><span>“And lesson three.” Lilia leaned in as if imparting ancient wisdom. “Never underestimate the spiritual significance of a good pair of socks.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at her. “That…that didn’t even have a subject.”</span></p><p><span>“It doesn’t need one. It applies universally.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha rubbed a hand down her face. “Right. Perfect. Absolutely. I’ll just…meditate on my socks.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia nodded in approval, clearly satisfied. “Good. You’ll figure it out eventually.”</span></p><p><span>“I sincerely doubt that.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh no,” Lilia said brightly. “You will. People like you always do.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha paused. “People like me?”</span></p><p><span>“People who hide in closets.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a strangled sound. “That was </span><em><span>one</span></em><span> time.”</span></p><p><span>“So far.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha pressed a pillow over her face. “I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear that.”</span></p><p><span>“Pretend all you like,” Lilia said, rising to her feet. “Just get some sleep.”</span></p><p><span>She took a few steps toward the stairs, then paused, turning back with a thoughtful expression.</span></p><p><span>“One more thing.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha lowered the pillow slowly. “…Yes?”</span></p><p><span>“If you ever find yourself in a situation where someone offers you a live goose- say no.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. Hard. “Why would anyone-”</span></p><p><span>“Just trust me,” Lilia said, already walking away.</span></p><p><span>Agatha watched her disappear up the stairs, wide-eyed and unsure whether she had just been warned about a future omen or simply subjected to Sokovian chaos.</span></p><p><span>The house fell silent again.</span></p><p><span>Agatha lay back on the couch, staring up at the ceiling, brain empty except for the echo of:</span></p><p><em><span>Never underestimate the spiritual significance of a good pair of socks.</span></em></p><p><span>“What the hell,” she whispered to herself.</span></p><p><span>She turned on her side. The blanket scratched. A spring poked her hip. And Wanda’s absence stung more than she wanted to admit.</span></p><p><span>But slowly, exhaustion dragged her under.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t dream.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t think.</span></p><p><span>She just slept.</span></p>

<p><span>Agatha woke to the distinct sensation of her spine staging a coup.</span></p><p><span>A sharp jolt ran down the entire length of her back, and she hissed through her teeth, blinking blearily at the living room ceiling. At some point in the night, the throw blanket had abandoned her completely, and the couch’s cushions had waged war against every joint she possessed.</span></p><p><span>She tried shifting. Bad idea. Every muscle protested. Her neck cracked in a way that probably violated at least three Geneva Conventions.</span></p><p><span>And yet, somehow, the worst part wasn’t the aching. It was the noise.</span></p><p><span>Because somewhere above her, two teenage boys were trying to murder each other with a level of enthusiasm usually reserved for coliseums.</span></p><p><span>“Tommy, get off me!”</span></p><p><span>“You get off me!”</span></p><p><span>“That’s literally what I just said-”</span></p><p><span>“Boys,” Agatha croaked.</span></p><p><span>Neither noticed.</span></p><p><span>She opened one eye.</span></p><p><span>Billy and Tommy Maximoff were half-wrestling, half-levitating over the rug inches from her head. Billy currently had Tommy in a headlock; Tommy was vibrating at a frequency that could probably destabilize a building.</span></p><p><span>Their sneakers thudded. A lamp rattled. Something crashed- Agatha hoped it was one of their bones.</span></p><p><span>She cleared her throat and tried again. “If you two don’t stop this instant, I swear on every remaining vertebra I have left I will transform you both into decorative holiday throw pillows.”</span></p><p><span>Both boys froze.</span></p><p><span>Billy blinked. “Good morning?”</span></p><p><span>“Is it?” Agatha said flatly, pushing herself upright one grimace at a time. “Because waking up to the sound of you two reenacting WWE above my corpse is not what I would classify as-”</span></p><p><span>Tommy pointed. “Why are you on the couch?”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, I don’t know,” Agatha snapped. “Maybe I simply adore chronic back pain.”</span></p><p><span>Billy nudged his brother. “I told you we’d wake her.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy shrugged. “She sleeps like a bat.”</span></p><p><span>“Well this bat is one noise away from draining your souls,” Agatha muttered, dragging the blanket off the floor and tossing it vaguely onto the couch.</span></p><p><span>She shuffled toward the kitchen, ignoring the way both twins whispered something about her being “extra grumpy today.” She did not have the energy to bite back. Yet.</span></p><p><span>The kitchen, blessedly, was quieter- though not by much.</span></p><p><span>The adults had gathered in their usual morning constellation: Pietro reading something on a tablet; Olek poking suspiciously at a bowl of fruit like it personally offended him; Iryna cradling a mug as if it contained the secret to immortality; and Wanda-</span></p><p><span>Wanda.</span></p><p><span>Hungover Wanda.</span></p><p><span>She was leaning against the counter, messy-haired, dead-eyed, and looking like someone had asked her to do calculus while being stabbed. When she saw Agatha, she didn’t even speak. She simply shoved a mug toward her with the defeated efficiency of someone paying a debt.</span></p><p><span>Agatha caught it on instinct. “Is this…?”</span></p><p><span>“Black, two sugars,” Wanda said hoarsely. “Like you take it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at the cup.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t say thank you. Wanda didn’t expect her to. Their exchange lived in the quiet space between acknowledgment and avoidance, neither naming what happened last night, both pretending it didn’t live under their skin.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sipped.</span></p><p><span>Damn her. It was perfect.</span></p><p><span>Agatha took another sip of the coffee, mostly to hide the fact that she was staring at Wanda over the rim of the mug like it had personally insulted her sense of emotional self-preservation. Then she forced her attention to the rest of the kitchen, where morning chaos had fully resumed.</span></p><p><span>Typical Maximoff morning.</span></p><p><span>Wanda, meanwhile, was trying very hard to look alive. The effort was failing.</span></p><p><span>“So!” Iryna suddenly announced, as if hosting a talk show. “Christmas Eve is coming up very fast.”</span></p><p><span>Billy stuck his head into the kitchen doorway. “That’s because actual time exists, Grandma.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy zipped in behind him. “Yeah, that’s kind of how December works.”</span></p><p><span>Iryna snapped her fingers at them. “Go eat something.”</span></p><p><span>Both boys retreated with twin sighs.</span></p><p><span>Pietro, without looking up from his tablet, went, “Speaking of Christmas Eve… we need to finish planning the white elephant game.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze mid-sip.</span></p><p><span>White what now?</span></p><p><span>“We already decided we’d do it after dinner,” Wanda said weakly, rubbing her temples.</span></p><p><span>“We do themes every year,” Iryna explained, turning toward Agatha. “Last year it was ‘Gifts no one asked for.’ The year before that was ‘As Seen On TV.’”</span></p><p><span>“Ah,” Agatha said slowly. “So a tradition of cruelty.”</span></p><p><span>Pietro laughed. “Exactly.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy reappeared. “This year is ‘Weird but Wonderful.’” He wiggled jazz hands for emphasis.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared. “I… see.”</span></p><p><span>Iryna smiled kindly. “You’ll need to pick up something for it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked again. “What?”</span></p><p><span>Everyone in the room turned toward her like she had just announced she’d never heard of indoor plumbing.</span></p><p><span>Wanda winced. “Oh god. Agatha. I forgot to tell you.”</span></p><p><span>“Tell me what?”</span></p><p><span>“That you… need a gift,” Wanda said, grimacing like it physically hurt her to admit it. “For white elephant.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared down into her mug as if the coffee would give her strength. “Why would I need a gift for an event I didn’t know existed?”</span></p><p><span>“I forgot,” Wanda repeated, voice small.</span></p><p><span>Agatha opened her mouth something sharp and dry perched on her tongue, but one look at Wanda’s exhausted, slightly green face made it dissolve.</span></p><p><span>Instead she muttered, “Fine. Whatever.</span></p><p><span>Pietro finally put down the tablet and stretched like he’d just hatched a brilliant plan. “Well! Lucky for you, I am going to the mall today.”</span></p><p><span>Billy’s voice floated in from the living room. “We’re going too!”</span></p><p><span>Tommy added, “We need new shoes because SOMEONE stole mine.”</span><span><br/></span></p><p><span>“You said I could borrow them!”</span><span><br/></span></p><p><span>“You returned them smelling like feet and betrayal!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha massaged her forehead. “Why is this my morning.”</span></p><p><span>Pietro continued, unfazed. “Since the twins and I are going, you can come with us and find a gift.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at him. “The mall. On a weekend. During December.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes,” he said cheerfully.</span></p><p><span>“Why,” she whispered, horror-stricken.</span></p><p><span>“Because,” Wanda said over her mug, trying to suppress a smirk, “you need a gift. And I, tragically, am too hungover to stand upright in a commercial environment.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha gave her a slow, withering glare.</span></p><p><span>Wanda bit her lip, failing to hide the tiny smile tugging there.</span></p><p><span>Before Agatha could respond, Iryna chirped, “It’ll be fun!”</span></p><p><span>“That word means nothing here,” Agatha muttered.</span></p><p><span>Pietro clapped his hands once, decisively. “So it is settled! We leave in twenty minutes.”</span></p><p><span>“Fantastic,” Agatha deadpanned. “Can’t wait.”</span></p><p><span>Pietro pointed at her like a drill sergeant. “Pack a coat. Drink more coffee. Prepare your soul.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha lifted her mug in a bitter toast.</span></p><p><span>“Fine,” she sighed.</span></p><p><span>And that, unfortunately, sealed her fate.</span></p><p><span>---</span></p><p><span>The second the automatic doors of the Westview Mall whooshed open, Agatha felt her soul leave her body.</span></p><p><span>Lights. Noise. People. Children. Screaming. Glitter. Carolers. A man in a peppermint-striped suit playing the saxophone.</span></p><p><span>It was like being trapped inside a snow globe designed by a psychopath.</span></p><p><span>Pietro breathed it in like oxygen. “Ahhh. Christmas!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at him, horrified. “You say that like it’s a </span><em><span>good</span></em><span> thing.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy zipped ahead, weaving through the crowd like a pinball. “Come on, slowpokes! We’re losing valuable shopping time!”</span></p><p><span>Billy jogged beside Agatha, eyes shining with manic holiday cheer. “Agatha, oooo you’re gonna love it here! There’s a whole pop-up market! And a craft table! And hot cocoa stands! And-”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Agatha said sharply, “and I already regret every choice that led me here.”</span></p><p><span>Billy didn’t take the hint.</span></p><p><span>He rarely did.</span></p><p><span>“So what’s it like living in the city?” he asked, already bouncing. “Do you get to see celebrities? Do you use the subway? Is it dangerous? Do people really yell at pigeons? Can you teach me how to file my FAFSA? Or like, is that a university thing? Is your research actually research or is it just you reading old scrolls and drinking tea-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stopped walking.</span></p><p><span>Billy stopped too, blinking.</span></p><p><span>She turned her head just enough to meet his eager expression. “Billy. Sweetheart. I say this with all the affection I can muster at this hour: if you do not allow me thirty consecutive seconds of silence, I am going to tie your shoelaces together and let gravity do the rest.”</span></p><p><span>Pietro laughed, slinging an arm around her shoulders as if she were part of the family whether she liked it or not. “You’ll get used to him. Eventually.”</span></p><p><span>“I won’t,” Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>“He’s like a golden retriever,” Pietro continued. “He only gets more energy the more you ignore him.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s not comforting.”</span></p><p><span>They waded deeper into the mall.</span></p><p><span>Every store had tinsel exploding from the windows. Oversized snowflakes dangled from the ceiling. A towering Christmas tree dominated the center of the atrium, surrounded by velvet ropes and a faux-north-pole backdrop.</span></p><p><span>A line of excited children snaked all the way around it.</span></p><p><span>Billy gasped. “Santa’s Village!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha eyed the Santa, who had a beard that looked aggressively flammable. “Yes. Truly a magical figure.”</span></p><p><span>Billy turned to her with a grin too mischievous to be legal. “You should sit on Santa’s lap!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at him, horrified. “Absolutely not.”</span></p><p><span>“Come on,” Billy said. “Just tell him what you want for Christmas!”</span></p><p><span>“What I want,” Agatha replied, “is for teenagers to stop suggesting felonies.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy snorted so hard he hiccupped.</span></p><p><span>Billy pressed. “He’s right there! It’ll be fun!”</span></p><p><span>“Fun for whom? Him? Me? OSHA?” Agatha crossed her arms. “The only way I am sitting on that man’s lap is if the universe collapses and he is the only remaining seat in existence. And even then, I would stand.”</span></p><p><span>Pietro laughed so loudly nearby children turned.</span></p><p><span>“All right, all right,” he said, “no Santa lap sitting. For now.”</span></p><p><span>She glared. “Not ever.”</span></p><p><span>“Right, right.” He tossed her a wink. “For now.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha inhaled through her nose, summoned patience, exhaled slowly, and reminded herself she was here for one reason: a stupid gift for a stupid party she didn’t even want to attend.</span></p><p><span>They pushed through a cluster of shoppers near a pretzel stand.</span></p><p><span>Tommy darted ahead toward a sneaker store.</span></p><p><span>Billy followed, talking at supersonic speed about some “super limited edition shoe drop” Agatha didn’t understand and did not want to.</span></p><p><span>Pietro stopped abruptly.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” he announced, “I need to grab one last Christmas gift. It’s a… surprise.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy perked up. “For who?”</span></p><p><span>Pietro shrugged theatrically. “Someone special.”</span></p><p><span>Billy gasped like he’d discovered a hidden treasure. “Is it for Mom??”</span></p><p><span>Pietro didn’t confirm, but he didn’t deny either.</span></p><p><span>Billy immediately started vibrating with gossip energy.</span></p><p><span>Before Agatha could escape, Pietro turned to her with a too-bright smile.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha, do you mind staying with the boys for a few minutes while I pick it up?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze.</span></p><p><span>“I- what? No. No, no. Absolutely not. Take them with you.”</span></p><p><span>“I can’t.” Pietro winced. “The store is… fragile.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at him. “Fragile?”</span></p><p><span>“Glass sculptures.”</span></p><p><span>“Why would you buy a glass sculpture for- never mind.” She rubbed her temple. “Take </span><em><span>one</span></em><span> of them.”</span></p><p><span>“They’re a matched set,” Pietro said earnestly.</span></p><p><span>“They’re people, not salt and pepper shakers.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes, but if I take just one, the other will cause irreparable chaos.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy, already halfway inside the sneaker store, yelled, “That’s fair!”</span></p><p><span>Billy nodded solemnly. “We really do work best in pairs.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eye twitched.</span></p><p><span>“No.” She crossed her arms. “Absolutely not. I am not responsible for these two.”</span></p><p><span>Pietro clasped her shoulder. “Agatha. Please.”</span></p><p><span>“No.”</span></p><p><span>“It will be five minutes.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s five minutes too many.”</span></p><p><span>“You survived the Salem witch trials,” Pietro said jokingly. “You can survive </span><em><span>this</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared him dead in the eye.</span></p><p><span>Then, traitorously, Billy added, “We’ll be good!”</span></p><p><span>Tommy yelled from the store, “Probably!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha considered running, fast and far.</span></p><p><span>Instead, she looked at the ceiling, whispered something that sounded vaguely like a prayer or a curse, and dropped her head in defeat.</span></p><p><span>“Fine,” she gritted out. “Five minutes.”</span></p><p><span>Billy pumped his fist.</span></p><p><span>Tommy cheered.</span></p><p><span>Pietro grinned and then vanished into the crowd.</span></p><p><span>And then Agatha was alone.</span></p><p><span>With the boys.</span></p><p><span>In the mall.</span></p><p><span>At peak holiday chaos.</span></p><p><span>She sighed, deeply, dramatically, like a woman preparing for martyrdom.</span></p><p><span>“This,” she muttered, following them into the sneaker store, “is how I die.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha had been in the store for exactly three minutes before she began questioning every life choice that had led her here.</span></p><p><span>Billy was buzzing around her like a mosquito made of caffeine and teenage hormones, firing off questions faster than her brain could process. Tommy kept touching everything within a ten-foot radius like he'd been possessed by the spirit of a bored raccoon. And the crowded store, packed wall-to-wall with shoppers and blaring Christmas music, felt like her own personal Hell.</span></p><p><span>Agatha rubbed her temple. “Billy, I swear on all that is holy, if you ask me one more question about ‘university bureaucracy,’ I will-”</span></p><p><span>“Okay, but do you actually grade on a curve?” Billy interrupted. “Because Tommy says that’s a scam professors invented to sound mysterious-”</span></p><p><span>“It is not a scam,” Agatha snapped. “It’s math.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s what scammers say,” Tommy said from behind her, loudly enough that a middle-aged woman browsing novelty socks looked over in alarm.</span></p><p><span>Agatha inhaled through her nose. “Do either of you ever… stop?”</span></p><p><span>“Nope,” Tommy said proudly.</span></p><p><span>“We’re a lot of fun,” Billy added.</span></p><p><span>“That’s… one word for it.”</span></p><p><span>She was debating whether she could fake a medical emergency to escape when she heard it.</span></p><p><span>Loud. Too loud. Cutting above the sound of Mariah Carey and crying toddlers.</span></p><p><span>“Professor Harkness?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha went absolutely still.</span></p><p><span>Oh no.</span></p><p><span>No, no, no, no-</span></p><p><span>Her body reacted before her brain did: her spine snapped straight, jaw locked, shoulders tensed. She turned slowly, praying to whatever higher power was listening that it was just some overeager freshman who didn’t understand boundaries.</span></p><p><span>It was not.</span></p><p><span>Her stomach dropped. Like, plummeted.</span></p><p><span>Standing a few feet away, in a gaudy red North Face jacket and a smirk that made Agatha’s molars grind, was Lauren Callahan.</span></p><p><span>Of all the undergraduates on God’s green earth…</span></p><p><span>“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Agatha muttered.</span></p><p><span>Billy leaned close, fascinated. “Friend of yours?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t blink. “Absolutely not.”</span></p><p><span>Lauren sashayed forward like she was approaching an open mic night. “Wow. I can’t believe it’s really you. Professor Harkness. Here. In Westview. At the mall.”</span></p><p><span>“Unfortunately,” Agatha said tightly. “Hello, Lauren.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy squinted. “She seems annoying.”</span></p><p><span>“She is,” Agatha said immediately.</span></p><p><span>Lauren gasped, hand pressed to her chest. “Wow. Still rude. Still bitter. Still holding that giant grudge because my dad told your dean you were abusing your power.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed her eyes for a long, murder-adjacent moment. “I did not ‘abuse my power.’ I gave you the grade you earned.”</span></p><p><span>Lauren rolled her eyes. “You failed me because you didn’t like me.”</span></p><p><span>“I failed you,” Agatha said, voice dangerously calm, “because you turned in a nineteen-page final essay that was actually eighteen pages of ChatGPT output and one page of conclusions you copied from Wikipedia.”</span></p><p><span>Lauren scoffed loudly. “Everyone uses AI now. It’s normal.”</span></p><p><span>Billy whispered to Tommy, “Did we just witness academic crime?”</span></p><p><span>Tommy whispered back, “This is better than Netflix.”</span></p><p><span>Lauren, ignoring the twins, smiled sweetly at Agatha. “Anyway! You’ll be so happy to know I passed the course the next semester when the university finally admitted you were being unfair.”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Agatha said sharply. “They forced me to stop teaching while they investigated your father’s tantrum, and then you passed because the department chair didn’t want to fight with the board. Those are not equivalent statements.”</span></p><p><span>Lauren’s smile widened. “Same outcome.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eye twitched.</span></p><p><span>The music overhead switched to “Jingle Bell Rock,” which felt pointed.</span></p><p><span>And then, because chaos breeds chaos, Lauren decided to escalate.</span></p><p><span>“Oh!” she chirped. “I should tell you- Daddy said he’s still keeping an eye on your department, just in case you try something again.” Then she raised her voice. Loud. “After all, we can’t have professors unfairly failing their students!”</span></p><p><span>Heads turned.</span></p><p><span>So many heads.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt heat crawl up her neck. “Lauren. Stop talking.”</span></p><p><span>But Lauren was in her element. “Actually- do you know what she did?” she asked a nearby couple who were just trying to look at the new Nikes, “She gave me a fifty-six! Can you imagine? Fifty-six!”</span></p><p><span>The couple blinked.</span></p><p><span>Tommy whispered to Billy, “What’s wrong with a fifty-six?”</span></p><p><span>Billy whispered, “It’s failing.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy’s eyes widened. “Oh damn.”</span></p><p><span>Lauren kept rambling, loudly, “And then she told me I wasn’t ‘engaging with the critical material!’ Like she’s some kind of genius!”</span></p><p><span>“Lauren,” Agatha said, hands curling at her sides, “you plagiarized.”</span></p><p><span>Lauren made a dramatic noise. “You can’t PROVE that!”</span></p><p><span>“I literally did prove it. In a twenty-page report.”</span></p><p><span>Lauren ignored that. “Anyway, it’s just funny seeing you here. Following your little students around. Getting kicked out of the classroom for a whole semester-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snapped.</span></p><p><span>There was only so much humiliation a woman could take in one lifetime.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” she said loudly, voice cutting through the store like a blade. “You know what? You want a scene? Fantastic. Let’s have a scene.”</span></p><p><span>Billy and Tommy vibrated in excitement.</span></p><p><span>Lauren opened her mouth, but Agatha plowed on, words sharp with months of pent-up rage.</span></p><p><span>“You didn’t fail because I didn’t like you,” she said. “You failed because you didn’t do the work. Because you cheated. Badly. Because you thought your last name was more important than learning anything.”</span></p><p><span>Lauren’s jaw dropped.</span></p><p><span>“And the only reason you passed later,” Agatha continued, “was because your father used his checkbook to strong-arm the department. I had to sit through months of pointless administrative meetings while you went on vacation to Cabo.”</span></p><p><span>A few shoppers audibly gasped.</span></p><p><span>Lauren’s face twisted. “You can’t talk to me like that!”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, trust me,” Agatha said, “I can. And I just did.”</span></p><p><span>Lauren stomped a foot, genuinely stomped it. “You’re- you’re such a-”</span></p><p><span>“Careful,” Agatha warned. “You couldn’t handle my vocabulary when you were sober.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy snorted so hard it echoed.</span></p><p><span>Billy whispered, “This is the best day of my life.”</span></p><p><span>Lauren, turning red, grabbed a display snow globe and- childishly, unbelievably- shoved it off the shelf.</span></p><p><span>It shattered across the floor.</span></p><p><span>People gasped again.</span></p><p><span>A mall employee screamed, “HEY!”</span></p><p><span>And then Agatha, who absolutely knew she should walk away, who absolutely knew this was a terrible idea, lost the last thread of restraint she had.</span></p><p><span>“Oh for the love of- grow up!” she shouted. “You’re twenty-three! You cannot throw a tantrum in the middle of a store because your professor wouldn’t pretend your essay wasn’t garbage!”</span></p><p><span>Lauren shrieked, “You ARE SO MEAN!”</span></p><p><span>And that was the exact moment mall security arrived.</span></p><p><span>Two guards approached with tired, holiday-season eyes.</span></p><p><span>“Alright,” one said. “What’s going on?”</span></p><p><span>Lauren pointed dramatically at Agatha. “SHE’S HARASSING ME!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha pointed back. “She broke store property!”</span></p><p><span>“Both of you,” the second guard said, “need to calm down.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy raised a hand. “For the record, the snow globe thing? Totally her.”</span></p><p><span>Billy nodded vigorously. “And Agatha didn’t harass anyone- she just… argued academically.”</span></p><p><span>The guards blinked at that.</span></p><p><span>But it didn’t matter.</span></p><p><span>Security didn’t want to investigate academic misconduct in the middle of a packed store three days before Christmas.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” the first guard sighed, “we’re escorting everyone out. Let’s go.”</span></p><p><span>Lauren immediately started fake crying.</span></p><p><span>Agatha immediately started loudly complaining.</span></p><p><span>The twins immediately started whisper-narrating like sports commentators.</span></p><p><span>It was a whole scene.</span></p><p><span>By the time the guards deposited them by the mall fountain, Agatha’s pulse was still racing.</span></p><p><span>Lauren huffed, muttered something about “calling her father,” then stomped away.</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled through her teeth. “I hate this mall.”</span></p><p><span>Billy looked at her with wide, admiring eyes. “Your job is SO cool.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. “…what?”</span></p><p><span>“You get drama,” Billy said. “And scandal. And you get to yell at people and be smart.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy added, “Grandma’s gonna be REALLY pissed you caused a public embarrassment.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha groaned loudly, head falling back. “Oh, perfect. Fantastic. Exactly what I needed.”</span></p><p><span>Billy clapped her shoulder. “Honestly? Kind of iconic, though.”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Agatha said. “No, it is not.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, it definitely is,” Tommy insisted.</span></p><p><span>Agatha rubbed her face. “Your grandmother is going to kill me.”</span></p><p><span>“Maybe,” Billy said brightly. “But it was worth it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at him.</span></p><p><span>Billy smiled like she’d just taken them to Disneyland.</span></p><p><span>And despite everything, despite the humiliation, the stress, the looming wrath of Iryna Maximoff, Agatha laughed.</span></p><p><span>A small, strangled, disbelieving laugh.</span></p><p><span>Then she sighed. “Let’s go find your uncle before something else explodes.”</span></p><p><span>The twins nodded eagerly.</span></p><p><span>And the three of them headed back into the mall, Agatha silently praying to survive the rest of the day in one piece.</span></p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>As Agatha and the boys stepped back inside the Maximoff house, the warmth of the place felt different, heavy, suffocating, thick with something unspoken. The holiday garlands and twinkling white lights didn’t soften it. Not even the faint smell of cinnamon from whatever Iryna had been baking earlier could mask the unmistakable tension in the air.</p><p>Perfect, Agatha thought.<br/>
Just perfect.</p><p>Of course word had gotten back here before they even made it up the walkway. Westview had many defining qualities, but privacy and plausible deniability were not among them. Judging by the stone-faced cavalry waiting in the living room- Wanda on the couch with her hands knotted tightly in her lap, Iryna perched in her favorite chair like a snow-queen warden, and Olek standing behind her with his arms folded- their return had been anticipated.</p><p>The second Pietro shut the front door behind them, Iryna launched.</p><p>“What in heavens happened?” she shrieked, each syllable sharp enough to cut glass.</p><p>Tommy opened his mouth just as Agatha inhaled to speak.</p><p>“Grandma, it wasn’t Agatha’s fault-” he began, voice earnest, protective in the way only a sixteen-year-old convinced of his own righteousness could be.</p><p>“Yeah,” Billy added, stepping up beside his brother. “This girl came up to Agatha shouting at her out of nowhere, and then she knocked over-”</p><p>“Enough, boys.”<br/>
Iryna didn’t raise her voice. She didn’t have to.<br/>
The command sliced the room clean.</p><p>“Go help your mother with the party decorations.”</p><p>“But-” Billy tried.</p><p>“No.” Her tone brooked no argument.</p><p>The twins fell silent. Tommy shot Agatha a sympathetic wince; Billy whispered something about how he still thought the whole thing was awesome. Agatha managed a small smile for him, something soft, tired, grateful. They slunk off toward the dining room to join their mother, leaving her alone at the center of the storm.</p><p>Iryna turned her sharp gaze to Pietro, who immediately lifted his hands like a man under arrest.</p><p>“I wasn’t there when it happened, Ma,” he said quickly. “I didn’t hear about it until after Agatha and the boys came to find me.”</p><p>He was telling the truth, and they all knew it. Still, Iryna gave him a long look, as though evaluating whether his absence was suspicious in itself before turning back to Agatha.</p><p>“This family has a reputation to uphold,” she said, each word precise, polished, practiced. “And as our guest, we expect you to respect that and conduct yourself with the utmost decorum.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth. Closed it. Her pulse thudded loudly in her ears.</p><p>“I- I wasn’t- I didn’t-” she tried again, fighting to keep her tone even. “I had no idea she would be there. And I never meant to cause… anything. A scene, or… whatever was reported back here.”</p><p>Her eyes flicked to Wanda, searching, hoping, for backup, even a hint of it. A glance. A gesture. Anything. But Wanda kept her head bowed, hair falling like a curtain, refusing to look up. Refusing to defend her. Refusing, it seemed, even to breathe too loudly.</p><p>It landed in Agatha’s chest like a stone.</p><p>Iryna waved her off, a brisk, dismissive gesture as though Agatha were a child caught tracking mud into a pristine sitting room.</p><p>Olek, who had been silent this whole time, watching with that unreadable, stern expression fathers seemed to be born training for, finally spoke.</p><p>“I suspect this shall be the last of the problems,” he said, voice deep and even.</p><p>It wasn’t really a question.<br/>
It was a verdict with the illusion of choice.</p><p>“Yes- of course,” Agatha rushed out. “Yes, it- this won’t happen again. I’m… very sorry.”</p><p>Her cheeks burned. Her throat tightened. God, she wanted to disappear upstairs, crawl under the covers, and pretend this entire day never happened. But Iryna wasn’t finished.</p><p>“Good,” she said, smoothing her skirt and rising with the elegance of someone who had spent fifty years hosting dinner parties and knew exactly how to project command without ever needing to raise her voice. “Now that that is taken care of, I must be off to get ready for the evening.”</p><p>She gave Agatha a final once-over- like she was checking that a stain had been scrubbed out but wasn’t entirely convinced.</p><p>“For the charity gala tonight,” she added pointedly, “I expect you to be on your very best behavior. No disruptions. No surprises.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. “Of course.”</p><p>Iryna didn’t wait for additional reassurance. She swept from the room, Olek following after a moment with one final, stoic nod in Agatha’s direction.</p><p>Silence spread out behind them like a long shadow.</p><p>Pietro sighed, rubbing his brow. “Ma gets… dramatic,” he muttered, trying for lightness. It didn’t stick. “She’ll cool down.”</p><p>Agatha attempted a polite smile, though it felt brittle. “I’ll, um… try not to single-handedly destroy your family’s social standing tonight.”</p><p>Pietro huffed a laugh but didn’t correct her.<br/>
That told her enough.</p><p>He clapped her lightly on the shoulder before retreating toward the kitchen, muttering something about checking on the twins.</p><p>Which left only Wanda.</p><p>Still seated.<br/>
Still silent.</p><p>Agatha stood there in the doorway of the living room, waiting. Hoping. Wanda didn’t look up. Didn’t offer anything- not a word, not an apology, not even a glance to acknowledge how humiliating the moment had been.</p><p>Agatha’s chest ached, not with anger, not exactly, but something thinner and more cutting. Something like being scolded in front of someone you love while that someone pretends you’re a stranger.</p><p>“Right,” Agatha said finally, voice quiet, resignation threaded through it. “I’ll… go get ready too.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t answer.</p><p>Agatha turned and headed upstairs, her footsteps soft against the carpet runner. Each step pulled her further from the living room noise, voices murmuring, decorations rustling, the faint sounds of the twins arguing over ribbon colors, and deeper into the quiet of the hall.</p><p>Into the room Wanda had grown up in. It felt more like a punishment than a refuge. </p><p>She closed the door behind her with a soft click, leaning against it for just a second, letting herself breathe out the tension she hadn’t been able to show downstairs.</p><p>Being closeted again was one thing.<br/>
Being embarrassed in front of Wanda’s family was another.</p><p>But the worst part, the part that stung, was knowing Wanda could have defended her. Could have said something. Could have offered even the smallest sign that she wasn’t alone in that moment.</p><p>Instead, Wanda had just… sat there. Watching her burn.</p><p>Agatha pressed her palms against her eyes, letting the exhaustion wash over her.</p><p>“Charity gala,” she muttered to herself. “Best behavior. No more problems.”</p><p>She huffed a humorless laugh.</p><p>“Oh, this will be a delightful evening.”</p><p>But she still pushed off the door and crossed the room, preparing to face the next storm.</p><p>Because in this house, under this roof, with these expectations pressing in from all sides-</p><p>She didn’t have a choice.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>She didn’t know how long she stood there before she heard movement in the doorway behind her. Soft footsteps. A breathy, hesitant inhale. Wanda’s voice, small but trying for steady.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t turn.<br/>
Didn’t answer.</p><p>The mattress creaked as Wanda sat on the edge of it. Not close enough to touch Agatha, but close enough that the air shifted between them.</p><p>“Can we talk?” Wanda asked quietly.</p><p>Still, Agatha didn’t look. She opened the drawer just to give her hands something to do, even though she wasn’t ready to get dressed. She sifted through sweaters until her fingers brushed a pair of black tights, the ones Wanda insisted made her ass look good.</p><p>Silence stretched.</p><p>Wanda tried again, voice firmer. “Agatha. Please.”</p><p>The word snapped something. Not loudly. Not like a breaking branch. More like the fragile sound of a thread pulled too tight.</p><p>Agatha closed the drawer slowly.<br/>
She still didn’t face Wanda.</p><p>“What,” she said, her tone clipped, “could you possibly want right now?”</p><p>Wanda flinched. “I just- I wanted to check on you. And talk about what happened downstairs.”</p><p>A humorless laugh slipped out of Agatha before she could stop it. Sharp. Bitter. “Oh, now we’re allowed to talk about it?”</p><p>Wanda rose from the bed. “That’s not fair-”</p><p>“Fair?” Agatha turned then, finally, her eyes sharp and exhausted. “Is fairness what we’re worried about now?”</p><p>Wanda’s lips pressed together. “Agatha-”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, holding up a hand. “If you’re going to scold me too, let’s just get it over with. Your mother already took care of most of it, but you’re welcome to add the finishing touches.”</p><p>“That’s not what I’m doing,” Wanda said, voice tight.</p><p>“You didn’t say a word,” Agatha shot back. “Not one. You sat there and let her talk to me like I was- like I was some stray dog knocking over trash cans.”</p><p>Wanda’s cheeks flushed a deep, guilty red. “I didn’t know what to say.”</p><p>“You didn’t know what to say?” Agatha repeated, incredulous. “Wanda, all you had to say was that I wasn’t some unhinged criminal at the mall. That I didn’t start some festive riot. That I- I don’t know- deserved the basic human courtesy of not being publicly scolded like a toddler.”</p><p>“You weren’t scolded like a toddler,” Wanda insisted weakly.</p><p>“Then what would you call it?”</p><p>Wanda’s silence was answer enough.</p><p>Agatha let out a breath she’d been holding for what felt like hours. “I didn’t even do anything wrong.”</p><p>“I know,” Wanda whispered.</p><p>“Do you?” Agatha asked, softer but sharper. “Because it didn’t seem like it.”</p><p>Wanda wrung her hands, a nervous habit, old as childhood. “I didn’t want to upset them.”</p><p>“And upsetting them is worse than defending me?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Wanda hesitated.</p><p>That was all Agatha needed.</p><p>Agatha laughed again- quiet this time, pained. “Wow.”</p><p>“Agatha, please don’t make this into something it’s not-”</p><p>“Oh no,” Agatha said, shaking her head. “It’s exactly what it is. Your mom’s image matters more than defending your- your…” She stopped herself before the word girlfriend slipped out. Before she made the mistake of naming the thing they’d agreed couldn’t exist here.</p><p>Wanda’s eyes flicked away, caught by the implication anyway.</p><p>“Agatha, you know why-”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha cut in. “Because you’re not out here. I know. Believe me, I know. I’ve known every second of every hour of every day we’ve been in this house.”</p><p>Her voice cracked. She swallowed it back.</p><p>“But do you have any idea,” she continued, quieter, “what it feels like to stand next to you and not be allowed to be- anything? Not your partner. Not your girlfriend. Not someone you’d defend when your family treats me like… like I’m a problem you regret inviting.”</p><p>Wanda’s breath hitched. “That’s not true.”</p><p>“It feels true,” Agatha said, the honesty landing between them with the weight of something that couldn’t be unsaid. “And you didn’t do anything to stop it.”</p><p>Wanda looked wounded, eyes glossy, jaw trembling just slightly. “I was trying to keep the peace.”</p><p>“Good for you,” Agatha said, blunt and tired. “But peace at my expense isn’t peace. It’s just me being silent so everyone else can stay comfortable.”</p><p>“That’s not fair,” Wanda whispered.</p><p>“You’re right,” Agatha said. “It’s not.”</p><p>They stood there for a long moment, Wanda teetering between guilt and defensiveness, Agatha between hurt and resignation.</p><p>Finally, Wanda spoke, voice small. “I didn’t want them to think badly of you.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her, stunned. “Wanda, they already think badly of me.”</p><p>Wanda opened her mouth, then closed it again when she realized she couldn’t contradict it.</p><p>Agatha sighed, the exhaustion sinking deeper. “Look, I get it. I get why you’re scared. I get why you’re not ready. But don’t expect me to pretend it doesn’t hurt. And don’t expect me to smile and nod when they talk to me like I’m a ticking bomb they can’t wait to send back to New York.”</p><p>Wanda wiped her cheek quickly, too quickly. “I’m trying.”</p><p>Agatha softened, just barely. “I know.”</p><p>Neither moved. Neither gave ground.</p><p>The air between them was thick and fragile, stretched to the limit.</p><p>After a moment, Wanda whispered, “We need to get ready. The gala starts in two hours.”</p><p>Of course it did.</p><p>Of course, they weren’t going to resolve any of this before being paraded in front of Westview’s wealthiest under twinkling lights and garland.</p><p>Agatha nodded once, curt. “Fine.”</p><p>They turned away from each other at nearly the same time.</p><p>Wanda walked to the closet. Agatha went to the suitcase at the foot of the bed. A silent choreography formed, quiet, strained, practiced after years of living in small New York apartments, but now coldly mechanical.</p><p>Clothes rustled. Hangers clinked.<br/>
The zipper on Agatha’s garment bag snagged, she cursed under her breath.</p><p>Wanda pulled out a deep burgundy dress. Agatha removed the black one she’d brought, simple and elegant, chosen because Wanda had once said it made her look “annoyingly irresistible.”</p><p>Wanda stepped into the bathroom to change.<br/>
Agatha stayed in the bedroom.</p><p>Even separated by a thin door, the silence pulsed with everything unsaid.</p><p>Agatha changed slowly, methodically, her fingers stiff as she smoothed the dress over her hips. She glanced at the mirror and instantly wished she hadn’t. Her reflection looked tired. Older. Worn out in a way exhaustion alone couldn’t explain.</p><p>She sat on the edge of the bed, fastening her heels.</p><p>By the time Wanda stepped out of the bathroom, fully dressed and dusted with makeup, Agatha had finished and moved to the vanity, brushing her hair with sharp, efficient strokes.</p><p>Wanda paused at the doorway, as if waiting for something- an invitation, a look, a word. Something that would tell her the chasm between them hadn’t widened beyond reach.</p><p>Agatha didn’t turn.</p><p>Wanda smoothed her dress nervously. “Do you need help with-”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, too quickly. Then quieter, “Thank you.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, lips pressed into a thin line.</p><p>They finished getting ready side by side, but entirely alone.</p><p>When Agatha finally stood and reached for her coat, Wanda did too, their movements mirroring one another in a way that would’ve been tender yesterday morning. Now it only underscored the distance.</p><p>Wanda gathered her clutch.</p><p>Agatha checked her phone, then deliberately put it away. She wasn’t about to risk scrolling or answering panicked student emails in this state.</p><p>Wanda exhaled shakily. “Agatha… before we go-”</p><p>Agatha stopped in the doorway.<br/>
But she didn’t turn around.</p><p>“Can we not,” she said quietly. “Not right now. I’m too tired to fight anymore tonight.”</p><p>Wanda’s silence throbbed like a bruise.</p><p>“Okay,” she whispered.</p><p>They walked out of the bedroom without touching. Without brushing hands. Without looking at each other.</p><p>Downstairs, the house buzzed with pre-gala chaos, voices, laughter, music, the clatter of trays and shoe buckles and someone shouting about misplaced shoes.</p><p>But as Agatha and Wanda descended the stairs, perfectly dressed and perfectly composed, they were the calmest part of the house.</p><p>Silent.<br/>
Polite.<br/>
Untouching.</p><p>Two women who had promised not to cause a scene.</p><p>And in doing so, had created the quietest one of all.</p><p> </p>

<p><span>The charity gala was held at Westview’s most aggressively decorated event hall, one of those old brick buildings that had been renovated just enough to feel expensive but not enough to lose its small-town earnestness. White lights twinkled from every banister. Evergreen garlands lined the staircase. A live quartet played something festive and dignified near the entrance.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stepped inside between Wanda and Pietro, trying not to be blinded by the sheer reflective power of Iryna Maximoff’s sequined gown as she swept ahead of them. Even Tommy muttered “Jesus” under his breath.</span></p><p><span>Within seconds, literally seconds, the Maximoffs were swarmed.</span></p><p><span>“Happy holidays!”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, Iryna, you look stunning!”</span></p><p><span>“Olek! Wonderful to see you!”</span></p><p><span>“Wanda, sweetheart, how are you?”</span></p><p><span>A circle of smiling faces closed around the family like a net, all familiar with one another, all eager to greet the hometown favorites.</span></p><p><span>Agatha became invisible almost instantly.</span></p><p><span>It didn’t surprise her.</span></p><p><span>Maximoffs were the unofficial royalty of Westview- pillar-of-the-community types with reputations of excellence, selflessness, and ironed napkins. Wanda’s mother had been on every board imaginable. Olek had chaired half the town’s charitable foundations. Everyone either loved them, wanted their approval, or wanted a favor.</span></p><p><span>Agatha, meanwhile, was…somebody’s “friend.” A tagalong. A name no one bothered trying to remember.</span></p><p><span>She stood half a step behind Wanda, doing her best impression of a polite, mute houseplant.</span></p><p><span>People greeted Wanda enthusiastically, hands clasping her arms, hugs pulled tight, effusive compliments. Over and over, the same lines:</span></p><p><span>“We’re so glad you’re here, dear!”</span></p><p><span>“Your parents said you’d be in town!”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, I remember you from the high school scholarship banquet!”</span></p><p><span>And then they’d glance vaguely toward Agatha with a flicker of polite confusion.</span></p><p><span>“Oh- hello. And you are…?”</span></p><p><span>“This is Agatha,” Wanda would supply quickly. “My roommate. From New York.”</span></p><p><span>Roommate.</span></p><p><span>Every time, it hit like a pin under the fingernail.</span></p><p><span>Agatha smiled tightly, nodded, said nothing. She was hardly given the opportunity to speak anyway; each introduction was followed by the conversation snapping back to Wanda or her parents.</span></p><p><span>After the fifth such exchange, Agatha began to feel the back of her skull prickling with irritation.</span></p><p><span>She shouldn’t have cared. She really, really shouldn’t have.</span></p><p><span>She did anyway.</span></p><p><span>Her gaze drifted across the hall, desperate for something, anything, that wasn’t another sugar-coated small-town conversation.</span></p><p><span>That was when she spotted Rio.</span></p><p><span>Rio stood near the bar like she’d been carved out of the golden lighting, dark curls pinned back loosely, a black dress that fit her too well, a drink in hand. When her eyes flicked upward and met Agatha’s, she smiled.</span></p><p><span>Not a big smile. Not attention-grabbing.</span></p><p><span>Just a tiny, warm, private thing.</span></p><p><span>A small flick of her fingers, a quick hello meant only for Agatha to notice.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s chest jolted before she could stop it.</span></p><p><span>Rio was one of the few people in this place who knew her without the diluted “roommate” label. One of the few who seemed to see her clearly. One of the few she wasn’t trying to squeeze herself smaller around.</span></p><p><span>She lifted her hand in a subtle return wave.</span></p><p><span>But before she could take a single step in Rio’s direction-</span></p><p><span>“Agatha?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s voice cut in, tight and polite.</span></p><p><span>Agatha lowered her hand instantly, pulse still jumping. “Yeah?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, an anxious habit Agatha had memorized as easily as her own reflection. “I…need to go with my parents for a bit. They want me to meet a couple of donors.”</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>It should’ve been fine. Normal. Expected.</span></p><p><span>But something in the way Wanda said it, brisk, almost relieved, like she couldn’t get the words out fast enough—made it sting more than Agatha anticipated.</span></p><p><span>Wanda hesitated, eyes darting toward her parents, then back to Agatha. “I’ll be back soon. Just…stay around here, okay?”</span></p><p><span>She said it gently, but it still sounded like an instruction. A boundary. A reminder of the distance between them now.</span></p><p><span>“Sure,” Agatha said evenly. “Go. Do your Maximoff thing.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda exhaled, guilt flashing across her face for half a second, then stepped away to join her parents, slipping seamlessly into the familiar glow of their social orbit.</span></p><p><span>And Agatha was once again left at the edges.</span></p><p><span>Surrounded by warmth she wasn’t allowed to touch.</span></p><p><span>She watched Wanda move through the crowd, smiling politely, nodding graciously, shining in a way she only ever did in Westview, where people knew her as the golden child, the perfect daughter.</span></p><p><span>Agatha wondered, not for the first time, if there was any place here for the part of Wanda who wasn’t perfect. The part who kissed Agatha with soft, desperate hands in the dark. The part who curled against her on Sunday mornings with bedhead and a coffee mug.</span></p><p><span>The part who chose her.</span></p><p><span>Because here, Wanda wasn’t choosing her. Not publicly. Not even quietly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a slow exhale, then drifted toward the edge of the room, searching for a corner where she could plant herself like a sad houseplant with wine.</span></p><p><span>Until a voice at her side startled her.</span></p><p><span>“You look like you’re contemplating fleeing the premises.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t even have to turn to know who it was.</span></p><p><span>Rio.</span></p><p><span>Rio materialized at her side with a glass of deep red wine already extended toward her like a peace offering.</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. “Do I look that desperate?”</span></p><p><span>Rio grinned. “You look like someone who’s two minutes away from faking a medical emergency to avoid small talk.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha took the glass. “If I do, it’s only because I am.”</span></p><p><span>She sipped, letting the warmth calm the fraying nerves Wanda had left buzzing under her skin. Rio watched her with that patient, amused curiosity that seemed built into her DNA.</span></p><p><span>“Rough start to the evening?” she asked.</span></p><p><span>“Let’s see,” Agatha said, ticking points off on her fingers. “I walked in, immediately became invisible, and was then abandoned within thirty seconds. So you tell me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio snorted a laugh. “Well, good news: you’re not invisible. I saw you instantly.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked. “That’s because you actually have taste.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, absolutely not,” Rio said. “You clearly haven’t seen who I went to prom with.”</span></p><p><span>They moved instinctively toward the corner of the ballroom, somewhere quieter, tucked behind one of the massive Christmas trees dripping with gold ribbon. It felt like a pocket of oxygen in an otherwise suffocating room.</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned against the wall, exhaling. “So. You’re here for… charity? Moral obligation? Blackmail?”</span></p><p><span>“All three,” Rio said. “But mostly because if I didn’t show up, half the town would try diagnosing themselves without supervision.</span></p><p><span>Agatha raised a brow. “They’re doing it even </span><em><span>with</span></em><span> you here.”</span></p><p><span>As if on cue, a man across the room caught Rio’s eye and mimed something that looked vaguely like pointing at his stomach and then giving a thumbs-down.</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned. “Oh God. He’s asked me twice tonight if I think his appendix is ‘vibing weird.’”</span></p><p><span>Agatha choked on her wine. “Is that the medical term?”</span></p><p><span>“Apparently at this gala it is.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head, laughing. “You poor thing. Must be exhausting, everyone begging you to diagnose them at parties.”</span></p><p><span>“It is,” Rio agreed dramatically. “Which is why you’re my sanctuary.” She clinked her glass lightly against Agatha’s. “To hiding.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha softened a little. “I’ll drink to that.”</span></p><p><span>They clinked again.</span></p><p><span>The lights from the chandeliers glittered across Rio’s features, warm, gold, easy. She had that rare ability to make any social setting feel like a private joke shared between two people. Agatha found herself relaxing in ways she hadn’t since arriving in Westview.</span></p><p><span>Agatha glanced out at the crowd. “So tell me- what’s the juiciest scandal happening within three feet of us?”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked. “You’re asking the right doctor.”</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned conspiratorially closer. “Okay. See that couple by the chocolate fountain?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha squinted. “Matching sweaters? I see them.”</span></p><p><span>“They’ve been pretending to be engaged for four years.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha gasped. “Why?”</span></p><p><span>“Her mother is terrifying and he doesn’t have the spine to tell the truth.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha slapped her arm lightly. “Rio!”</span></p><p><span>“I’m only repeating what he drunkenly confessed to me at a fundraiser.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha cackled. “This party is a gold mine.”</span></p><p><span>“They always are,” Rio said, sipping again.</span></p><p><span>Another person passed by and gave Rio the familiar “Should I worry about this rash?” look.</span></p><p><span>Rio raised one finger without even looking at them. “If it’s not actively smoking, I don’t want to hear about it right now.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha bit her lip to hold back a laugh. “You’re too powerful.”</span></p><p><span>“Please. I’m barely holding it together.” Rio stepped a little closer. “But you’re making it… shockingly less torturous.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked down at her glass, pretending not to feel the warmth bloom in her chest.</span></p><p><span>“Well,” she said softly, “glad to be of service.”</span></p><p><span>Rio opened her mouth- maybe to reply, maybe to tease her again- when a voice suddenly called her name sharply.</span></p><p><span>They both turned.</span></p><p><span>One of the event organizers was waving frantically at Rio from across the ballroom. Judging by the expression on her face, someone had either collapsed or complained that their blood felt “too warm.”</span></p><p><span>Rio sighed. “Shit. That’s my cue.”</span></p><p><span>The disappointment that flickered through Agatha was embarrassingly sharp, and she masked it with a smirk.</span></p><p><span>“Duty calls?”</span></p><p><span>“Always.” Rio hesitated just a second longer than necessary. “I’ll come find you later?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt her pulse skip. “…Sure.”</span></p><p><span>Rio gave her a quick, apologetic half-grin. “Don’t talk to anyone boring while I’m gone.”</span></p><p><span>“No promises.”</span></p><p><span>And with that, Rio slipped into the crowd- leaving Agatha once again alone beneath the glittering lights, wine glass in hand, heartbeat annoyingly louder than the music.</span></p><p><span>Agatha drifted away from the spot where Rio had been standing, the warmth of their laughter still buzzing pleasantly beneath her skin. It was ridiculous, childish even, how quickly one person could brighten an entire awful night. But now Rio was swept off somewhere by a colleague or admirer, and Agatha was exactly where she always seemed to end up in this town: alone, vaguely out of place, and trying not to make it obvious that she was counting the minutes until she could leave.</span></p><p><span>The gala was loud enough to feel like a living creature. Music, chatter, clinking glasses, forced laughter, everything blurred into a hum that made her shoulders tighten. She slipped along the edges of the ballroom, weaving through clusters of people who didn’t look at her twice, who recognized every Maximoff in the room but had no interest in the mysterious woman hovering several paces behind them.</span></p><p><span>She could practically feel Wanda somewhere in the crowd, some gravitational pull she hated admitting she was still attuned to, but she avoided looking. She wasn’t ready for another round of avoidance smiles and brittle politeness, not after the argument in the bedroom, not after the car ride full of tension sharp enough to cut glass.</span></p><p><span>She was halfway to deciding she might fake a sudden migraine when a voice snapped her name.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>She halted. Marina Maximoff, perfectly put together in a sleek navy gown, hair in an updo that looked like it had cost more than Agatha’s monthly rent, stood with one hip propped against a tall cocktail table, swirling a glass of champagne.</span></p><p><span>“Oh,” Agatha said, schooling her expression into neutrality. “Hi.”</span></p><p><span>“Having a good time?” Marina asked.</span></p><p><span>Her tone was polite. Her eyebrows were not.</span></p><p><span>Agatha forced a nod. “Yes. Lovely party.”</span></p><p><span>“Really?” Marina’s mouth twitched into something that wasn’t quite a smile. “That’s… shocking.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. “Shocking?”</span></p><p><span>“Well,” Marina said, shrugging one bare shoulder, “considering you don’t know anyone and Wanda left you on your own the moment you walked in the door.”</span></p><p><span>A stiff laugh slipped out before Agatha could stop it. “It’s fine. I don’t need a babysitter.”</span></p><p><span>Marina hummed into her champagne, amused in a way Agatha could not read. “I didn’t say you did. I just find it impressive that you’re still smiling.” She took another sip. “Especially since Wanda went off to spend time with her ex-boyfriend.”</span></p><p><span>The words sank slow, heavy, like a stone dropped into cold water.</span></p><p><span>“…her what?” Agatha said, trying, and failing, to keep her tone even.</span></p><p><span>Marina’s brows shot up. “You didn’t know?” She gave a sympathetic wince. “Oof. Sorry, I assumed she’d mentioned that was where she headed off to.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s stomach plummeted.</span></p><p><span>“She and Vision get… cozy at events like this,” Marina continued with the conversational bluntness of someone discussing the weather. “Old habits, I guess. They were together for years. Everyone thinks they are secretly still together. Surprised she hasn’t mentioned it you, you know, being her roommate and all.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed hard. “Where?”</span></p><p><span>“Hm?”</span></p><p><span>“Where are they?” she repeated, quieter this time.</span></p><p><span>Marina didn’t point. She didn’t need to. She tilted her chin subtly toward the far side of the ballroom.</span></p><p><span>And Agatha saw them.</span></p><p><span>Wanda. Vision.</span></p><p><span>Tucked into a velvet loveseat in the corner. Close enough that their knees brushed. Close enough that Wanda was leaning in as she laughed- really laughed, head tipped back, her hand rising to touch Vision’s forearm like it was instinct.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s breath stuttered.</span></p><p><span>She watched Vision say something soft, watched Wanda tuck a piece of hair behind her ear, watched her lean a little closer, watched the distance between them shrink into something achingly familiar-</span></p><p><span>Something intimate.</span></p><p><span>Something like a couple.</span></p><p><span>Something that made Agatha’s chest feel too tight, too hollow, too hot all at once.</span></p><p><span>“Well,” Marina said lightly, swirling her drink, “isn’t that…something. Though I would be a little upset if my best friend left me alone at a party to try and respark an old flame.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t trust herself to speak.</span></p><p><span>Her face pulled into the nearest approximation of a smile she could manage, brittle around the edges, painfully thin.</span></p><p><span>“Excuse me,” she said, voice barely above a whisper.</span></p><p><span>And before Marina could say another word, Agatha turned and headed straight for the only safe thing in the room:</span></p><p><span>The bar.</span></p><p><span>The crowd thickened around her, but she barely noticed. Her steps were too fast. Her throat too tight. Her pulse too loud. She didn’t shove past anyone, but she didn’t slow, either, moving like she needed to get away before the floor tilted under her.</span></p><p><span>The bar was mercifully less crowded, though still loud, still bright, still unbearably festive for someone who suddenly felt like the villain in her own story.</span></p><p><span>She slid into an empty patch of counter and braced both hands against the polished wood, head bowing for a breath.</span></p><p><span>She was fine.</span></p><p><span>She was absolutely, completely, painfully fine.</span></p><p><span>“Drink?” the bartender asked.</span></p><p><span>Agatha lifted her head.</span></p><p><span>“Yes,” she said. “God, yes.”</span></p><p><span>And as he poured, Agatha kept her eyes firmly on the glass, refusing to glance back toward the corner where Wanda sat laughing with someone who was allowed to be loved publicly.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t look.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t have to.</span></p><p><span>She could feel it.</span></p><p><span>Agatha had just begun to feel the edges of her mind soften, her irritation dissolving into something warmer, buzzier, even when a voice sliced straight through her thin veneer of calm:</span></p><p><span>“Well. If it isn’t the woman who caused that… scene at the mall today.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed her eyes briefly.</span></p><p><span>Just one night. One night without this town making this her personal Hell. Was that truly so much to ask?</span></p><p><span>She turned.</span></p><p><span>Standing before her was a woman dressed in shimmering silver satin, hair swept high in a way that said </span><em><span>money, legacy, and probably a deep emotional attachment to Pilates</span></em><span>. Agatha did not recognize her at all.</span></p><p><span>The woman, however, clearly recognized her.</span></p><p><span>Or thought she did.</span></p><p><span>Agatha forced a polite smile. “I’m sorry- have we met?”</span></p><p><span>“No.” The woman waved a dismissive hand. “But word travels fast in a small town. And I was at the mall today. Everyone saw it.” She looked Agatha up and down with a wrinkle of distaste. “That little… altercation.”</span></p><p><span>“It wasn’t an altercation,” Agatha said, keeping her tone level.</span></p><p><span>“It looked like one.” The woman took a slow sip of her champagne, eyes not leaving Agatha’s face. “I must say, it’s surprising the Maximoffs would keep someone around who clearly lacks the… decorum expected at community events.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hand tightened around her wine glass.</span></p><p><span>She inhaled through her nose- quiet, controlled.</span></p><p><em><span>Do not engage. Do not engage. Do not fu-</span></em></p><p><span>The woman continued, oblivious to the internal firestorm she was stoking.</span></p><p><span>“I suppose big-city people are just different. Drama everywhere you go, hm?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt her pulse spike.</span></p><p><span>“Ma’am,” she said carefully, “I truly don’t know what you think you saw at the mall-”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, I saw enough.” The woman leaned in conspiratorially. “Poor Wanda. Sweet girl. And her family- such pillars of the community. This must be so embarrassing for them.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s jaw locked.</span></p><p><span>Her chest tightened, anger climbing fast and sharp, fueled by humiliation, exhaustion, the crushing weight of the last few days-</span></p><p><span>And then she felt a presence at her back.</span></p><p><span>A familiar perfume. Sharp heels. Controlled warmth.</span></p><p><span>“Celia,” Iryna Maximoff purred.</span></p><p><span>The woman, Celia, visibly straightened. “Oh! Iryna, hello! You look radiant tonight.”</span></p><p><span>“Thank you.” Iryna smiled, tight and impeccable. “I see you’ve met Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>Celia’s smile twisted. “Yes, we were just discussing-”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Iryna continued smoothly, overriding her, “is a professor from the city. Wanda’s friend. She’s spending the holidays with us.”</span></p><p><span>The emphasis was unmistakable.</span></p><p><em><span>Enough.</span></em></p><p><span>Celia faltered. “Oh. Well. Isn’t that… lovely.”</span></p><p><span>There was no graceful exit for her now. So she chose speed.</span></p><p><span>“I should- yes, I should mingle. Enjoy the rest of your evening.”</span></p><p><span>She scurried off, heels clicking in panicked little taps across the ballroom floor.</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a slow breath she’d been holding.</span></p><p><span>“Thank you,” she began quietly, turning toward Iryna.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t get to finish.</span></p><p><span>Iryna held up a single finger.</span></p><p><span>Not rude. But not kind, either.</span></p><p><span>“There is no need for gratitude,” she said. “I merely wished to prevent unnecessary escalation.”</span></p><p><span>Ouch.</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed that, lips pressing into a thin line.</span></p><p><span>Iryna’s expression remained perfectly composed, but cool. Detached. As though Agatha were an issue to be managed. A variable to be contained.</span></p><p><span>“And Agatha?” Iryna said, smoothing a hand down the front of her dress.</span></p><p><span>“Yes?” Agatha answered.</span></p><p><span>“I expect,” she said softly but firmly, “no more problems. Tonight especially.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s throat tightened.</span></p><p><span>She nodded once. “Understood.”</span></p><p><span>“Good.” Iryna inclined her head, already turning back toward the sea of donors, officials, and carefully curated friendships filling the ballroom. “Enjoy the gala.”</span></p><p><span>Right.</span></p><p><span>Enjoy it.</span></p><p><span>As if this night, this week, this entire visit hadn’t been a minefield of judgment, secrecy, and thinly veiled scrutiny.</span></p><p><span>As if she weren’t standing alone in a crowded room where she was both invisible and under a microscope.</span></p><p><span>As if she hadn’t just watched Wanda curl into her ex-boyfriend’s side like muscle memory.</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled through her nose.</span></p><p><span>Her wineglass was empty.</span></p><p><span>She turned sharply toward the bar.</span></p><p><span>Maybe tonight, enjoyment came in merlot.</span></p><p><span>Agatha nursed the remnants of her wine, the stem of the glass pinched between two fingers, her posture stiff enough to snap. People moved around her in waves of sequins and cologne and money, God, so much money, laughing too loudly, sipping champagne like it tasted better because it was poured from a crystal artifact rather than a bottle.</span></p><p><span>But none of that mattered.</span></p><p><span>Not really.</span></p><p><span>Because all she could see- no matter where she shifted her gaze, no matter how deeply she tried to disappear into the barstool- was Wanda.</span></p><p><span>And Vision.</span></p><p><span>Wanda, leaning in close to him. Wanda, smiling at something he said. Wanda, brushing invisible lint off his suit jacket. Wanda’s hand on his arm. Wanda’s eyes soft, familiar, comfortable.</span></p><p><span>Wanda looking like she had before New York. Before Agatha. Before anything had changed.</span></p><p><span>Before Agatha had hoped for things she had no right to hope for.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s stomach twisted hard. Her grip tightened around the glass. She watched Vision murmur something into Wanda’s ear, watched Wanda nudge him with her shoulder, watched them laugh together in a way that made Agatha feel both invisible and painfully exposed.</span></p><p><span>A slow spiral. That’s what it was.</span></p><p><span>She could feel it happening in real time.</span></p><p><span>The room grew louder- no, not louder. Just…sharper. Like every laugh was pointed at her. Like every clink of glass vibrated against her ribs. Like every passing stranger’s perfume was suffocating her.</span></p><p><span>She took another swallow of wine. It didn’t help.</span></p><p><span>Her chest felt too small and too full at the same time.</span></p><p><span>What was she even doing here? Why had she agreed to this? Why was she watching Wanda play picture-perfect holiday darling with her ex-boyfriend while she, the current girlfriend, sat alone at a bar like some tragic extra in a romantic comedy?</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled through her nose, slow and controlled, grounding herself in the cool marble of the counter beneath her palm.</span></p><p><span>Just breathe.</span></p><p><span>It didn’t work.</span></p><p><span>The longer she watched Wanda tilt her head toward Vision, the more something inside her coiled, tight and hot and ugly.</span></p><p><span>Her jaw ached from clenching.</span></p><p><span>Damn it.</span></p><p><span>She shouldn’t care this much.</span></p><p><span>She shouldn’t feel this much.</span></p><p><span>She shouldn’t be sitting here wishing Wanda would look at her the way she was looking at him.</span></p><p><span>Another wave of laughter drifted from their corner. Wanda’s laugh. Wanda’s.</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed hard, forcing her gaze away.</span></p><p><span>But she must not have been fast enough because the second she turned her face toward the bar, she caught motion in her periphery.</span></p><p><span>Wanda was walking over.</span></p><p><span>Agatha schooled her features carefully, smoothing out anything that resembled emotion. By the time Wanda reached her, she was a blank slate.</span></p><p><span>Or she hoped she was.</span></p><p><span>“Hey,” Wanda said softly, like she was approaching a wild animal that might bolt if startled. “You’ve been over here a while.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha hummed, noncommittal. “Mm.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda frowned a little. “Are you okay?”</span></p><p><span>“Peachy,” Agatha replied, her tone clipped. She didn’t look at Wanda. She stared straight ahead, swirling the last sip of wine like it had suddenly become very interesting.</span></p><p><span>Wanda shifted her weight. “You sure? You seem…off.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m fantastic,” Agatha said, a touch too brightly. “Living the dream.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda stared at her, eyebrows drawing together. “Agatha-”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t,” Agatha cut in. “I don’t really want to do this right now.”</span></p><p><span>“Do what?” Wanda asked, sounding genuinely confused. Or pretending to be. Agatha couldn’t tell which was worse.</span></p><p><span>Agatha finally turned her head, slowly, and met Wanda’s eyes.</span></p><p><span>Wanda looked beautiful. Even in the dim ballroom lighting. Even with a slight crease of worry between her brows. Even with Vision standing behind her in the distance, waiting for her to come back.</span></p><p><span>And that hurt. More than Agatha wanted to admit.</span></p><p><span>Agatha set her empty glass down and forced a smile that didn’t reach her eyes. “I’m fine, Wanda. Really. I just need…a minute.”</span></p><p><span>“Did something happen?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha almost laughed. Hysterically. “No. Nothing happened. Everything’s great.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda flinched at the tone. “It doesn’t sound great.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked away again. “I’m going to step outside for some air.”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha-”</span></p><p><span>“It’s loud in here,” Agatha said, sliding off the stool before Wanda could grab her wrist or force her to make eye contact again. “And I’m trying very hard not to say anything I’ll regret.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s eyes widened, confusion flickering into something else. Hurt? Frustration? But Agatha didn’t stick around long enough to decipher it.</span></p><p><span>She brushed past her gently but firmly.</span></p><p><span>“Just need some air,” she repeated.</span></p><p><span>Then she walked.</span></p><p><span>Pushed through the bodies.</span></p><p><span>Dodged sequins and elbows and champagne flutes.</span></p><p><span>And didn’t look back until she reached the double doors leading out to the balcony.</span></p><p><span>The cold air slammed into her like a blessing.</span></p><p><span>She exhaled hard, letting the chill burn through her lungs, letting her shoulders drop for the first time in what felt like hours.</span></p><p><span>Inside, behind her, the party roared on.</span></p><p><span>And Wanda- Wanda was still somewhere in that chaos.</span></p><p><span>Somewhere with Vision.</span></p><p><span>Agatha rested her hands on the balcony railing, closed her eyes, and let the cold wind hit her full in the face.</span></p><p><span>She focused on her breathing.</span></p><p><span>In. Out. In. Out.</span></p><p><span>Don’t think about Wanda.</span></p><p><span>Don’t think about Vision’s hand on Wanda’s arm.</span></p><p><span>Don’t think about how Wanda didn’t even look guilty.</span></p><p><span>Just breathe.</span></p><p><span>The balcony door clicked softly behind her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t turn. If it was Wanda, she wouldn’t be able to disguise the way her shoulders tensed. And if it was some other well-meaning stranger here to ask if she was “alright,” she might throw herself off the balcony out of pure social exhaustion.</span></p><p><span>Footsteps. Slow. Even.</span></p><p><span>Then a voice.</span></p><p><span>“I can relate.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes opened. She turned her head just enough to see Rio leaning casually against the railing beside her, hands tucked in the pockets of her coat, curls pulled back loosely, cheeks flushed from the warmth inside.</span></p><p><span>Rio wasn’t looking at her, just out at the snow-dusted grounds below, as if the two of them simply happened to arrive on the same patch of concrete by coincidence.</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed. “To what?”</span></p><p><span>Rio hesitated just a beat too long.</span></p><p><span>Then: “Nothing.”</span></p><p><span>A small, almost embarrassed smile tugged at her mouth, and she shrugged like she’d said something meaningless.</span></p><p><span>But Agatha had learned the way people lied for comfort. She wrote dissertations on it. She could read the tiny shift in Rio’s posture, the quick flick of her eyes, the breath that came just a touch too shallow.</span></p><p><span>Rio meant </span><em><span>something.</span></em><span> She just wasn’t naming it.</span></p><p><span>And Agatha didn’t push.</span></p><p><span>Mostly because she wasn’t sure she </span><em><span>could</span></em><span> handle hearing someone say they understood her particular brand of heartbreak.</span></p><p><span>So she turned back toward the yard, mirroring Rio’s stance.</span></p><p><span>The silence that settled between them wasn’t awkward- just… unspoken. A truce neither of them acknowledged aloud.</span></p><p><span>Rio blew out a breath, watching it cloud in front of her. “Gala’s something, huh?”</span></p><p><span>“That’s one word,” Agatha muttered.</span></p><p><span>“What’s another?”</span></p><p><span>“Claustrophobic. Shallow. Horrifying.” A beat. “Sparkly.”</span></p><p><span>Rio snorted. “Sparkly is accurate.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha finally allowed herself a tiny smile. “You looked like you were having fun diagnosing strangers’ imaginary ailments.”</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned dramatically. “You have </span><em><span>no</span></em><span> idea. I’ve had six people tonight pull me into corners to describe their symptoms. One woman asked me to look at a mole.” She shuddered. “A mole, Agatha. At a formal event. In a room full of doctors who would bill her.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed, really laughed, and it startled her with how badly she’d needed it.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s smile warmed, slow and soft. “There it is.”</span></p><p><span>“What?”</span></p><p><span>“That sound. You should use it more often.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha rolled her eyes to hide the way her chest flipped. “Well, I usually reserve it for when I’m not being emotionally waterboarded by holiday festivities.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s fair.” Rio nudged her elbow lightly. “But still. It suits you.”</span></p><p><span>And there it was again- the moment. The pull.</span></p><p><span>Nothing dramatic. Nothing stated.</span></p><p><span>Just warmth.</span></p><p><span>Just ease.</span></p><p><span>Just… understanding. Quiet but undeniable.</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked back out at the snow. “Thanks,” she murmured.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t respond right away, but she didn’t need to. The space between them said enough.</span></p><p><span>They stood like that for another few minutes, breathing, sharing the cold, letting the noise of the party remain behind thick glass where it belonged.</span></p><p><span>Rio eventually tilted her head. “If you want to hide out here longer, I’ll stand guard.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha huffed. “I’m not hiding.”</span></p><p><span>Rio gave her a look. It was gentle. Disbelieving. Knowing.</span></p><p><span>Agatha groaned. “Fine. I’m temporarily retreating.”</span></p><p><span>“Much healthier framing,” Rio said solemnly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha bumped her shoulder lightly. “You’re insufferable.”</span></p><p><span>“And yet you keep talking to me,” Rio teased.</span></p><p><span>“Only because the alternatives inside are worse.”</span></p><p><span>Rio grinned. “I'll take it.”</span></p><p><span>The door suddenly burst open behind them, letting out a wave of warm air and far too much noise.</span></p><p><span>Wanda stood there.</span></p><p><span>Her face was flushed- whether from alcohol or dancing or something else entirely, Agatha didn’t know. Her brows pinched together when she saw them. “There you are. I’ve been looking everywhere.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stiffened instinctively.</span></p><p><span>Rio straightened. “I’ll leave you two.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned toward her quickly. “You don’t have to-”</span></p><p><span>Rio gave her a soft smile. “I know.”</span></p><p><span>And with that- no resentment, no jealousy, no bitterness- Rio slipped back inside.</span></p><p><span>Wanda didn’t even wait for the door to close before stepping toward Agatha. “Can you please come back in? My parents are asking where you went.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at her a long moment. Her breath curled in the cold between them.</span></p><p><span>She wanted to ask </span><em><span>why Wanda cared now.</span></em></p><p><span>She wanted to ask </span><em><span>why Vision got her laughter and Agatha got silence.</span></em></p><p><span>She wanted to ask </span><em><span>why she was even here.</span></em></p><p><span>But all she said was, “Sure.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda reached for her arm- reflexively, thoughtlessly- and Agatha let her hand hover just far enough away that Wanda’s fingers brushed air instead.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s expression flickered.</span></p><p><span>Agatha ignored it.</span></p><p><span>She stepped past her, opened the door, and walked back into the noise and light and expectation waiting inside.</span></p>

<p><span>Agatha stood in front of the small vanity in Wanda’s childhood bedroom, watching her own reflection button up the last of her blouse. Her eyes were shadowed, not from lack of sleep, though that certainly didn’t help, but from the hangover of last night’s emotional whiplash.</span></p><p><span>Behind her, Wanda was brushing her hair with mechanical precision. Every smooth stroke of the brush looked like a person pretending to be fine.</span></p><p><span>It was too quiet.</span></p><p><span>Agatha hated quiet this early in the morning. It felt like being trapped in the pause right before a bomb detonates.</span></p><p><span>She cleared her throat lightly. “You sleep?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda stiffened a beat too long before answering. “Eventually.”</span></p><p><span>“Mm.” Agatha nodded at her own reflection, though the sound carried more doubt than agreement. “You were… up late.”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah.” Wanda set the brush down. “A lot going on.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha hummed again. Another noncommittal sound. The room was full of them.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s eyes flickered toward her in the mirror- tentative, testing- but Agatha looked away first.</span></p><p><span>She wasn’t angry.</span></p><p><span>Okay, that was a lie. She was furious. Mostly at herself, but Wanda came in a close second.</span></p><p><span>Still, she didn’t want another argument. Not yet. Not this early. Not when her skull was pounding like a drummer had taken up residence behind her eyes.</span></p><p><span>She crossed to the bed and pulled on her boots. Halfway through tying one, she paused.</span></p><p><span>“So,” she said as lightly as she could manage, “I still need a white elephant gift.” She waited a beat. “Want to come with me to get one?”</span></p><p><span>It was a perfectly normal question. Casual. An olive branch disguised as weekend errands.</span></p><p><span>Wanda didn’t treat it like one.</span></p><p><span>She winced.</span></p><p><span>Actually winced.</span></p><p><span>“Oh- um. I… can’t.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s fingers froze on the zipper. Slowly, she lifted her head.</span></p><p><span>Wanda wasn’t even looking at her.</span></p><p><span>“I already promised my mom I’d help today,” she explained, reaching for a pair of earrings on her dresser. “She wants me and-” She hesitated. An awful half-second. “-me and Vision to go pick up the last of the food and supplies for the Christmas Eve party.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked.</span></p><p><span>Once.</span></p><p><span>Twice.</span></p><p><span>“Vision,” she repeated, flat.</span></p><p><span>Wanda flinched, meaning she heard her own mistake, even if she wasn’t ready to acknowledge it.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha, it’s not-”</span></p><p><span>“No.” Agatha stood up. “Stop. Please don’t say ‘it’s not what it sounds like.’ People only say that when it is exactly what it sounds like.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda turned, eyes wide. “It’s not like that. I just- my mom asked us both because she trusts him with this stuff and she wants everything perfect. And I already told her we’d go. I can’t back out now.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t a kind laugh.</span></p><p><span>“Oh no, God forbid you disappoint Mommy Maximoff.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s face flushed. “That’s not fair.”</span></p><p><span>“Fair?” Agatha gestured around the room as if it held the past week’s worth of tension pinned to the walls. “You’ve left me alone every time your mother or Vision snaps their fingers. Every single time.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s not true!”</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” Agatha said, raising her chin. “What about last night? The second I turned around, you were glued to Vision like the two of you were starring in a winter romance movie.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s voice sharpened. “We were talking.”</span></p><p><span>“You were cuddling.”</span></p><p><span>“That is not-”</span></p><p><span>“You leaned into him!” Agatha threw up her hands. “Do you understand what that looked like from where I was standing?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda swallowed hard. “I wasn’t thinking. I was just- caught up.”</span></p><p><span>“In him?” Agatha challenged.</span></p><p><span>“In the nostalgia!” Wanda snapped back. “He’s someone I grew up with! Someone my parents adore! It was... familiar.” Her voice softened, pained. “It was easier than… us.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha reeled at the honesty. “Easier?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda pressed the heels of her hands to her eyes, agonized. “Agatha, please- I didn’t mean it like that.”</span></p><p><span>“No, I think you did.”</span></p><p><span>“Just because…” Wanda’s voice trembled. “Just because I’m not ready for the whole world to know doesn’t mean what we have isn’t real.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha went quiet.</span></p><p><span>Not because she didn’t have anything to say. Because she had far too much.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” she finally whispered. “Then act like it’s real.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s head snapped up.</span></p><p><span>“You keep choosing everyone else,” Agatha said, voice low. “Vision. Your parents. The image your family wants to present. I’m always the one who gets left behind.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s not-”</span></p><p><span>“Then come with me today.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda hesitated.</span></p><p><span>Only a second.</span></p><p><span>But it was enough.</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled sharply and stepped back. “Right. Got it.”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha-”</span></p><p><span>“No, really.” She pulled on her coat. “Loud and clear.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda stepped in front of the door, face pained. “Can we not fight? Please? I just- I don’t want this morning to be like the other night.”</span></p><p><span>“Well,” Agatha said tightly, “maybe you shouldn’t have let last night become last night.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s jaw tightened. “I’m trying my best.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s voice softened against her will. “So am I.”</span></p><p><span>For a moment, neither looked away.</span></p><p><span>For a moment, something like understanding flickered between them.</span></p><p><span>Then Wanda said quietly, “I need to go. My mom’s waiting.”</span></p><p><span>Of course she was.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s smile was thin, brittle. “Then go.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda opened her mouth, maybe to apologize, maybe to lie, maybe to finally say something real, but no words came out.</span></p><p><span>Instead, she slipped past Agatha, grabbed her purse, and walked out.</span></p><p><span>The door shut harder than she meant it to.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stood in the silent room, staring after her.</span></p><p><span>Then she let out a breath that felt like it had been trapped in her ribcage for hours.</span></p><p><span>“Fantastic,” she muttered. “Truly. Couldn’t ask for a better start to the day.”</span></p><p><span>She sank onto the edge of the bed, hands covering her face.</span></p><p><span>The room felt too big and too small at the same time. She needed air. She needed a plan. She needed-</span></p><p><span>Her phone buzzed in her pocket.</span></p><p><span>And suddenly, Agatha knew exactly what she needed to do.</span></p><p><span>She pulled out her phone, thumb hovering for a second before pressing call.</span></p><p><span>Rio picked up on the third ring.</span></p><p><span>“Hello?” she answered, warm but cautious, and then her tone shifted when she recognized the caller. “…Agatha?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha cleared her throat, attempting nonchalance and failing. “Hey.”</span></p><p><span>A small amused breath. “Hey yourself. Didn’t expect to hear from you before noon.”</span></p><p><span>“Didn’t expect to be awake before noon,” Agatha muttered. “But here I am. Living the dream.”</span></p><p><span>“That bad?”</span></p><p><span>“You have no idea.”</span></p><p><span>A low chuckle. “Try me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha hesitated. The last thing she wanted was to dump all her Maximoff-family-drama onto Rio. They were… something. But not that. Not yet. And honestly, Agatha wasn’t convinced she was emotionally stable enough for that talk.</span></p><p><span>So she steered the conversation hard in the other direction.</span></p><p><span>“I need a white elephant gift,” she blurted.</span></p><p><span>There was a beat of silence- not judgmental… just amused.</span></p><p><span>“That’s why you called me?” Rio said. “Not because you miss me terribly? Not because you can’t stop thinking about how stunning I looked last night at the gala?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose because of </span><em><span>course</span></em><span> Rio would do this. “I need a gift, Rio.”</span></p><p><span>“You wound me. Truly.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha fought a smile. “Do you know where I can get one or not?”</span></p><p><span>“A gift?” Rio said, dramatic. “For a festive holiday event? During peak Christmas season? In a town with exactly three functioning Christmas shops? It will be difficult, but… perhaps… with my unparalleled expertise…”</span></p><p><span>“Rio-”</span></p><p><span>“Fine, fine.” A soft laugh. “Where am I meeting you?”</span></p><p><span>“Town square?”</span></p><p><span>“You hate town square.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m desperate.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s the spirit,” Rio teased. “Or technically, that’s the lack of spirit, which is very on brand for you.”</span></p><p><span>“Are you going to meet me or are you going to keep heckling me?”</span></p><p><span>“Both,” Rio said cheerfully. “Give me thirty minutes.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha couldn’t help it- she actually smiled. “Thank you.”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t thank me until you see the crowds,” Rio warned. “Also, Agatha?”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah?”</span></p><p><span>“You sound like you need a day away from… all of that.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed. “I do.”</span></p><p><span>“Then I’ll see you soon,” Rio said gently. “And we’ll fix it.”</span></p><p><span>The call ended before Agatha could respond.</span></p><p><span>She sat there for a moment, phone still in her hand, feeling something loosen in her chest, something small but real. A moment of light after a long, suffocating night.</span></p><p><span>She took a breath, squared her shoulders, and headed downstairs.</span></p><p><span>The family was buzzing around the house prepping for the day. Someone was yelling about ribbon. Someone else was yelling about someone yelling about ribbon. Standard Maximoff chaos.</span></p><p><span>Agatha found Wanda slipping on her boots by the door, expression still pinched from their fight.</span></p><p><span>“Hey,” Agatha said, keeping her tone as neutral as possible. “Can you drop me off at the town square?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda blinked at her. “Town square? Why?”</span></p><p><span>“Meeting someone,” Agatha said simply.</span></p><p><span>That surprised Wanda, Agatha saw it flash across her face, but Wanda just nodded slowly.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah. Sure,” Wanda said, something softening just slightly. “I can do that.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha grabbed her coat. “Great.”</span></p><p><span>The silence between them wasn’t comfortable, but it wasn’t fiery anymore either. Just… fragile. Tentative.</span></p><p><span>They walked out to the car together, neither quite knowing how to talk, or where to begin, or what to name.</span></p><p><span>But Agatha at least knew one thing:</span></p><p><span>She was going to get through today.</span></p><p><span>And Rio was going to help her do it.</span></p><p><span>— </span></p><p><span>Agatha slipped into the warmth of the little café like she was slipping into a hiding place. Bells chimed overhead, and the smell of cinnamon, mulled apples, and espresso wrapped around her like a thick scarf. She exhaled slowly, partly in relief, partly in…resetting.</span></p><p><span>Resetting her expression.</span><span><br/></span><span>Her shoulders.</span><span><br/></span><span>Her entire emotional state.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s car had barely pulled away before Agatha rushed to the counter.</span><span><br/></span><span> “One hot cider,” she said. Then paused. “Actually…two.”</span></p><p><span>The barista raised an eyebrow. “Double-fisting this early?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stiffened. “They’re not both for me.”</span></p><p><span>The barista grinned like they didn’t believe her at all.</span></p><p><span>Agatha took the drinks to a tiny table by the window, the golden-orange cider glowing like stained glass in the morning light. She took a sip.</span></p><p><span>She hated how much she liked it.</span></p><p><span>She glared at the cup as if it had betrayed her.</span></p><p><em><span>Stupid warm, delicious…holiday beverage.</span></em></p><p><span>Before she could argue with her drink further, the café door opened again, the bells jingling.</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped inside, brushing snow from her hair, cheeks pink from the cold. She spotted Agatha instantly, and her grin widened with the force of someone who found exactly whom she hoped to find.</span></p><p><span>“Well, well,” Rio said as she approached. “Professor Harkness. Out in the daylight. Festive beverage in hand. Should I alert the local news?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha rolled her eyes and gestured toward the untouched cider. “I got you one. Don’t make me regret it.”</span></p><p><span>Rio sat and slid the cup closer, peering at it suspiciously. “Hot cider? </span><em><span>Hot cider?</span></em><span>” She gasped dramatically. “Who are you and what have you done with Agatha Harkness?”</span></p><p><span>“I like trying new things,” Agatha sniffed. “…occasionally.”</span></p><p><span>Rio took a sip, eyes never leaving Agatha. “Uh-huh. Sure. And next you’ll be telling me you knit ornaments or collect nutcrackers.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha made a face. “Absolutely not. The day you see me knit anything is the day-”</span></p><p><span>“You admit you enjoy Christmas?” Rio supplied with a smirk.</span></p><p><span>“-the day hell freezes over.”</span></p><p><span>“Mm-hm.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha tried to glare at her, but Rio’s grin made it difficult. It was much too warm. Much too knowing.</span></p><p><span>“Come on,” Rio said, rising from her chair and nudging Agatha’s elbow. “Let’s go find your weird-but-wonderful gift before your future in-laws throw you out into the snow.”</span></p><p><span>“They’re not-” Agatha started, then stopped. “You know what? Let’s just go.”</span></p><p><span>Rio beamed and hooked her arm casually through Agatha’s as they stepped back into the cold. Agatha absolutely did not notice the warmth of her. Or the closeness. Or the steady confidence of the way she walked.</span></p><p><span>Town square was buzzing: a live brass quartet under a tent, kids ice-skating on a temporary rink, booths selling handmade scarves and candles and ornaments shaped like questionable snowmen. Everything glittered. Everything smelled like pine.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eye twitched.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” Rio announced. “Theme is weird but wonderful. That’s literally the tagline for half this town.”</span></p><p><span>“Do not insult the town,” Agatha muttered. “Only I’m allowed to do that.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed. “Right, right. My mistake.”</span></p><p><span>They approached the first booth, a cluttered spread of odd figurines, windchimes made from forks, and a ceramic bowl shaped like a goose.</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked at it slowly. “Why…does it have teeth?”</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned in. “Oh my God. It does. That’s horrifying.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m not buying someone a carnivorous bowl.”</span></p><p><span>“You sure? It’s kind of amazing.”</span></p><p><span>“No.”</span></p><p><span>“Coward.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha sputtered, “I- excuse me?! I am </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> a coward-”</span></p><p><span>Rio picked up a set of earrings shaped like tiny pickles wearing Santa hats. “What about these? Would Wanda’s mom like these?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha choked on absolutely nothing. “Do not bring Wanda’s family into this. Ever.”</span></p><p><span>Rio was laughing again, that soft, melodic sound that made the hair on the back of Agatha’s neck relax without permission.</span></p><p><span>They moved to the next booth, then the next.</span></p><p><span>At the table of handcrafted knickknacks, Rio held up a mug shaped like a screaming possum.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at it. “What…in God’s name…”</span></p><p><span>“It’s weird.” Rio turned it. “And wonderful.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s a crime.”</span></p><p><span>“So that’s a no?”</span></p><p><span>“Absolutely not.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re no fun.”</span></p><p><span>“On the contrary,” Agatha said, sifting through a box of carved wooden figurines, “I am excellent fun when people aren’t forcing me to enjoy festive atrocities.”</span></p><p><span>Rio opened her mouth, then paused and looked at her sideways. “You know…you're actually relaxing.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze mid-reach. “I am not.”</span></p><p><span>“You are,” Rio said gently. “Your shoulders have lowered like…two full inches. Maybe three.”</span></p><p><span>“That is an exaggeration.”</span></p><p><span>“You almost smiled.”</span></p><p><span>“I did not.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s grin turned smug. “You did.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha grabbed a small carved mushroom figure and pointed it threateningly at her. “I will-”</span></p><p><span>“You’ll what?” Rio laughed. “Threaten me with fungus?”</span></p><p><span>“It’s wooden. And sharp.”</span></p><p><span>Rio still wasn’t intimidated.</span></p><p><span>Which annoyed Agatha far more than it should’ve.</span></p><p><span>They spent the next twenty minutes wandering from booth to booth, Rio slipping into commentary like a stand-up comedian, Agatha firing back with dry wit sharper than ice.</span></p><p><span>The dynamic was easy.</span><span><br/></span><span>Light.</span><span><br/></span><span>Something she hadn’t felt in…too long.</span></p><p><span>At one booth, Rio lifted a snow globe featuring a tiny creature lounging in a hammock.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” she announced. “This one. This is it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha eyed it critically. Inside the globe, the thing was fuzzy, cheerful, perhaps intoxicated.</span></p><p><span>“It’s ridiculous,” she said.</span></p><p><span>“Exactly.” Rio placed it in her hands. “Weird. Wonderful. And vaguely concerning. Perfect.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned it over, watching glitter swirl. And she realized-</span></p><p><span>She liked it.</span></p><p><span>Damn it.</span></p><p><span>“…fine,” she muttered. “This one.”</span></p><p><span>Rio whooped triumphantly and bumped her shoulder against Agatha’s. “See? I told you we’d find something.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha tried not to melt at that little burst of pride.</span></p><p><span>Together they walked back toward the center of the square, both carrying steaming cups and swinging the bag with the snow globe inside.</span></p><p><span>Agatha glanced at Rio, cheeks rosy from cold, eyes bright, hair tucked into a beanie that somehow made her look even more annoyingly charming.</span></p><p><span>A strange, quiet warmth settled in Agatha’s ribcage.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t even realize she’d spoken until the word was already out of her mouth.</span></p><p><span>“Lunch?”</span></p><p><span>It hung there between them- light, impulsive, strangely intimate. She blinked at Rio as if someone else had said it entirely. Rio blinked back, a quick flash of surprise passing over her face before softening into something warm.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah,” Rio said. “Lunch sounds… great.”</span></p><p><span>Neither of them moved for a second, as if their feet needed time to catch up with their mouths. Then Agatha gestured toward the street, and they started walking side by side, their steps falling into an easy rhythm without much thought. The air outside felt cooler now, fresher, cleaner. Maybe that was just relief; maybe it was the company.</span></p><p><span>The sidewalks were busy but not aggressively so, and they slipped into a companionable silence for a few blocks. Agatha found herself aware of small things, how close Rio walked next to her, the faint brush of their coats whenever one of them shifted, the way Rio kept glancing around like she was soaking in the city all over again.</span></p><p><span>Eventually, Rio pointed ahead with a touch of triumph. “There. That place. It looks cute.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha followed her gaze to a narrow little sandwich shop wedged between a florist and an optometrist. It didn’t look like much, hand-written chalkboard menu, rickety outdoor tables, a bell on the door that seemed determined to jingle louder than necessary. But the smell drifting out when they opened the door was shockingly good.</span></p><p><span>Inside, the space was tight and full of people but cozy, the kind of spot you found by accident and insisted you’d discovered first. They shuffled toward the counter.</span></p><p><span>Rio scanned the menu with a dramatic squint. “I’m about to order something weird. Please don’t judge me.”</span></p><p><span>“I judge everyone,” Agatha said. “It’s my love language.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed and placed her order: a toasted sandwich full of roasted sweet potato, goat cheese, pickled red onion, something called ‘garlic maple drizzle,’ and, Agatha swore she heard this correctly, a layer of crushed pretzels for crunch.</span></p><p><span>“That’s a hate crime,” Agatha muttered.</span></p><p><span>Rio grinned. “You just have a very limited culinary worldview.”</span></p><p><span>“What I have is standards.”</span></p><p><span>“And yet,” Rio said with a smug little tilt of her head, “you’re going to try a bite.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha opened her mouth to refuse, but somehow the word didn’t show up. She sighed instead. “We’ll see.”</span></p><p><span>They ordered and found a small table near the window. Rio took the chair that offered a view outside; Agatha took the one facing her. Their knees bumped under the table and neither of them apologized. Neither pulled back.</span></p><p><span>Conversation started slowly, like a pot warming on a stove, small remarks about the gala, a few shared jokes about terrible music choices, mutual irritation toward anyone who tried too hard to look rich. But then something loosened. Something settled. And their words began finding each other more easily, like they’d been waiting for an excuse.</span></p><p><span>“You were really overwhelmed in there,” Rio said gently. “At the gala. I mean- sorry, you don’t have to talk about it.”</span></p><p><span>“No, it’s fine.” Agatha toyed with her napkin. “I just don’t do well in crowded spaces. Especially ones full of expectations.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded, not pushing. “I get that.”</span></p><p><span>A comfortable beat of quiet passed, and Agatha found herself studying Rio’s face. There was something open about her. Something steady.</span></p><p><span>“Do you like doing what you do?” Agatha asked.</span></p><p><span>“What, being a surgeon?" Rio shrugged. “Most days. I like healing people and giving families more time, bodies more mobility. Plus it’s like really gross and cool.” She paused. “And you? Do you like what you do?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a soft, surprised laugh. “I don’t know if anyone has ever asked me that.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s brows lifted. “Really?”</span></p><p><span>“Really.” Agatha shifted, uncomfortable but honest. “I like teaching. I like watching my students figure things out. But the administration, the expectations, the pressure- it’s a lot. And I think sometimes I forget that I’m allowed to enjoy things. Or want things.”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t answer right away. Instead, she looked at Agatha like she was reading a deeper line between her words. “You’re allowed,” she said quietly.</span></p><p><span>The sandwiches arrived then, saving Agatha from having to respond. Rio’s monstrosity was somehow even worse up close. Agatha studied the oozing smear of goat cheese and the rogue pretzel crumbs sticking out the sides.</span></p><p><span>“That’s illegal,” Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>Rio pushed the plate toward her. “Try it.”</span></p><p><span>“I am not-”</span></p><p><span>“One bite.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m not-”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>That did it. Agatha rolled her eyes, leaned forward, and took the smallest possible bite.</span></p><p><span>The flavors hit her all at once: sweet, salty, tangy, creamy, crunchy. Aggressively delicious. Traitorously delicious.</span></p><p><span>Rio watched her like she might record the moment. “Well?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha reluctantly swallowed. “I hate that I like it.”</span></p><p><span>Rio beamed. “Victory tastes like goat cheese.”</span></p><p><span>“Never say that again.”</span></p><p><span>But she took another bite anyway. Rio looked absurdly pleased.</span></p><p><span>Their conversation kept flowing, surprisingly easy and surprisingly real. They jumped between light and serious, Rio telling a story about one of her patients who’d once tried to wheel themselves out of the hospital to avoid surgery on their arm, fully thinking they could outwheel the nurses running, Agatha recounting an incident involving a parent who’d threatened to “manifest consequences.” They both laughed more than either expected.</span></p><p><span>At one point, Agatha realized she’d stopped paying attention to the shop around them. The noise, the people coming in and out, the clatter of plates- it all faded behind Rio’s voice. She didn’t know when it had happened, but the afternoon had softened into something gentle.</span></p><p><span>Something she didn’t want to end.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned back in her chair. “This was a great idea.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. “It wasn’t an idea. It was… spontaneous.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s what made it great.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked down at the last bite of her sandwich then at Rio. “You make things easier,” she said quietly, surprising herself again.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s expression flickered, like she’d heard something heavier than Agatha meant to reveal. “You do too.”</span></p><p><span>That pulled them into a silence that wasn’t awkward or heavy. It simply existed, warm, soft, unexpected. A silence shaped like possibility.</span></p><p><span>They stood at the same time, too quickly, too in sync, and both paused in the narrow aisle between tables like they’d bumped into something invisible and fragile.</span></p><p><span>Rio recovered first, flashing a grin as she slid her coat on. “Well, Professor, you successfully survived a meal with me.”</span></p><p><span>“Barely,” Agatha said, brushing past her, though the corner of her mouth betrayed her. “I still think whatever that…thing was shouldn't legally count as food.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh please,” Rio said, following her out, “you liked it. Don’t think I didn’t clock the way you went back for three extra bites.”</span></p><p><span>“I was hungry,” Agatha lied.</span></p><p><span>Rio made a disbelieving noise.</span></p><p><span>They stepped out into the cold afternoon sun, the air crisp and white-edged. Agatha tucked her chin into her scarf. Rio shoved her hands in her pockets and bounced a little, energized by the cold like a kid hopped up on sugar.</span></p><p><span>Then Rio stopped abruptly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha took another two steps before turning back. “What?”</span></p><p><span>Rio pointed ahead with the delighted wickedness of someone revealing a master plan.</span></p><p><span>The Westview winter festival ice rink sparkled in the center of town square, music playing, lights strung overhead, kids stumbling across the ice, couples gliding hand-in-hand.</span></p><p><span>Rio clasped her hands dramatically. “Agatha. Oh my god. Skating. We’re going skating.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s face went flat. “Absolutely not.”</span></p><p><span>Rio gasped. “Absolutely yes.”</span></p><p><span>“I will fall. I will break something important. I will sue the city.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped closer, lowering her voice. “Come on. One lap.”</span></p><p><span>“No.”</span></p><p><span>“Half a lap.”</span></p><p><span>“No.”</span></p><p><span>“Standing on the ice while holding the rail.”</span></p><p><span>“Rio-”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha.” Rio leaned in with faux solemnity. “Live a little.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. “You’re relentless.”</span></p><p><span>“Thank you,” Rio said brightly.</span></p><p><span>Against every instinct, every shred of dignity, every molecule of self-preservation, Agatha exhaled sharply and muttered,</span></p><p><span>“Fine.”</span></p><p><span>Rio lit up like a Christmas tree. “YES!”</span></p><p><span>And before Agatha could change her mind, Rio grabbed her wrist and tugged her toward the rental booth.</span></p><p><span>Ten minutes later, Agatha stood on the edge of the rink, wobbling like a newborn deer.</span></p><p><span>“This was a mistake,” she declared.</span></p><p><span>Rio, already gliding backward like a show-off, said, “Only if you die. And honestly? You probably won’t.”</span></p><p><span>“Comforting,” Agatha muttered, gripping the railing with both hands.</span></p><p><span>Rio skated up to her and offered both hands. “Trust me.”</span></p><p><span>“Rio, the last time someone told me that, I ended up locked out of my office for an entire day.”</span></p><p><span>Rio snorted. “Tragic. Now stop stalling.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha hesitated a fraction too long, because Rio reached forward, grabbed her hands, and gently coaxed her onto the ice.</span></p><p><span>Her skates slid. Her balance abandoned her. For a horrifying second she was sure she was going down-</span></p><p><span>Rio caught her around the waist, steadying her with strong hands and a soft laugh.</span></p><p><span>“Oh my god,” Agatha hissed. “I hate this. I despise this.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re doing fine.”</span></p><p><span>“I am dying.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re being dramatic.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shot her a glare colder than the ice they were standing on.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t even blink. “Come on. Just move with me.”</span></p><p><span>So Agatha did.</span></p><p><span>At least, she attempted to.</span></p><p><span>Within thirty seconds she tripped over her own feet, shrieked a string of profanity, and crashed into Rio so hard they slid several feet across the rink.</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed so loudly an entire cluster of teenagers stared.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t encourage them,” Agatha muttered, mortified.</span></p><p><span>“Are you kidding?” Rio wheezed. “You’re incredible. I haven’t had this much fun since Billy tried to sled down their garage roof.”</span></p><p><span>“That sounds idiotic.”</span></p><p><span>“It was! He broke his mom’s garden angel. But still.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha cracked, just barely, into a smile.</span></p><p><span>They went again. And again. Agatha clung to Rio’s hands the whole time, cursing creatively with each stumble while Rio kept her upright with steady palms and bubbling laughter.</span></p><p><span>After nearly twenty minutes, Agatha finally reached her limit. Her legs trembled. Her back ached. Her dignity fluttered somewhere in the distance like a lost scarf.</span></p><p><span>She braced herself, planting her skates in one spot as firmly as gravity allowed.</span></p><p><span>Rio coasted to a stop in front of her. “You tapping out?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded, breathless. “If I stay out here any longer, they’ll need to airlift my body out.”</span></p><p><span>Rio grinned. “Fair.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t move.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t either.</span></p><p><span>Snow began to drift softly around them, settling in Rio’s hair, catching on Agatha’s lashes. The rink glowed under the string lights. Music hummed somewhere, blurred by winter air and heartbeat.</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked at Rio, really looked, and felt something warm spark beneath her ribs.</span></p><p><span>Rio held her gaze, breath fogging between them.</span></p><p><span>And Agatha, in a moment of terrifying clarity, said quietly,</span></p><p><span>“Hey… I think you still owe me a drink.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s smile was slow, blooming.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, Professor,” she murmured, stepping in just close enough for heat to slip between them, “I was counting on it.”</span></p>

<p><span>Agatha did not want the day to end.</span></p><p><span>The thought came uninvited, sharp and undeniable, slicing clean through the careful detachment she’d been maintaining all afternoon. She tried to bury it immediately, file it away under </span><em><span>things we are not examining right now</span></em><span>, but it clung to her like the cold still lingering in her coat.</span></p><p><span>She walked beside Rio down Main Street, boots crunching faintly over salted pavement, the late afternoon lights already beginning to glow in shop windows. Westview had slipped into that golden pre-evening hour where everything looked softer than it had any right to be. The town square behind them was still buzzing faintly, music drifting from the rink, laughter echoing, but here, farther down the street, it was quieter. Intimate.</span></p><p><span>Dangerous.</span></p><p><span>Agatha shoved her hands into her pockets and focused on the rhythm of her steps.</span></p><p><em><span>This is nothing,</span></em><span> she told herself.</span><span><br/></span><em><span>A drink. One drink. That’s it.</span></em></p><p><span>She was very good at lying to herself.</span></p><p><span>Rio glanced sideways at her, a smile still tugging at her mouth from the rink, cheeks flushed pink from cold and exertion. “You’re thinking very hard for someone who just threatened to sue the ice.”</span></p><p><span>“I was assaulted,” Agatha said solemnly. “Repeatedly.”</span></p><p><span>“You signed the waiver.”</span></p><p><span>“I did not.”</span></p><p><span>“You stepped onto the ice willingly.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha scoffed. “I was coerced.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed, bright and unguarded, and Agatha felt it low in her chest- felt the way it loosened something she’d been holding tight all day.</span></p><p><span>She hated that.</span></p><p><span>The bar sat on the corner, all dark wood and warm light spilling onto the sidewalk. A hand-painted wreath hung crookedly on the door, and someone had stuck a red bow to the handle with far too much enthusiasm.</span></p><p><span>Rio stopped short. “Oh. This place.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “You sound haunted.”</span></p><p><span>“I had a birthday here once,” Rio said. “It involved karaoke and a margarita tower.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smiled despite herself. “I’m intrigued.”</span></p><p><span>“Concerned is the correct reaction.”</span></p><p><span>They went inside.</span></p><p><span>The bar was crowded but not suffocating, locals clustered around high-tops, couples tucked into corners, a low hum of conversation layered with old holiday music playing softly through the speakers. The smell of citrus and whiskey hung in the air.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt it then- the familiar instinctive tightening. The awareness of space. Of people. Of the possibility of being seen.</span></p><p><span>She pushed it down.</span></p><p><span>They claimed stools at the bar, coats shrugged off, gloves stuffed into pockets. The bartender approached, cheerful and already tired.</span></p><p><span>“What’ll it be?”</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned her elbows on the bar. “Surprise me. Something festive.”</span></p><p><span>The bartender grinned. “Dangerous choice.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t hesitate. “Old fashioned.”</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked. “Of course you drink an old fashioned.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s efficient,” Agatha said coolly. “No nonsense.”</span></p><p><span>“Mmm,” Rio hummed. “I’m learning so much.”</span></p><p><span>The drinks arrived quickly, Agatha’s amber and precise, Rio’s bright with citrus and cranberries, garnished with a rosemary sprig she immediately smelled before taking a sip.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” Rio said, eyes lighting up. “This is excellent.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha took a careful sip of her own. Warmth spread through her chest, grounding. Familiar.</span></p><p><span>Good.</span></p><p><span>She almost stayed at the bar.</span></p><p><span>Almost.</span></p><p><span>But then, unbidden, intrusive, Lilia’s voice echoed in her mind.</span></p><p><em><span>Sit in a booth.</span></em></p><p><span>Agatha grimaced faintly.</span></p><p><span>Rio noticed. “What’s that look?”</span></p><p><span>“Nothing,” Agatha said, already sliding off the stool. “Come on.”</span></p><p><span>“Where are we going?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha took Rio’s wrist, not her hand, she told herself, </span><em><span>not her hand</span></em><span>, and tugged her toward the nearest booth tucked into the corner, half-shadowed, just far enough from the bar to feel removed.</span></p><p><span>Rio followed easily, eyebrows raised but amused. “Are we hiding?”</span></p><p><span>“No.”</span></p><p><span>“This feels like hiding.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha slid into the booth, back to the wall by instinct. “I prefer… strategic seating.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled slowly as she took the opposite side. “Ah. Survival instincts.”</span></p><p><span>“You’d be surprised how many environments are actively hostile,” Agatha replied dryly.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s expression softened, not pitying, not prying. Just understanding.</span></p><p><span>They settled in, drinks between them, knees almost touching beneath the table.</span></p><p><span>Almost.</span></p><p><span>Conversation resumed easily, as if it had never stopped, meandering and light at first. Rio told a story about a patient who’d tried to bribe her with baked goods. Agatha countered with an anecdote about a faculty meeting that devolved into a screaming match over printer toner.</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed so hard she had to set her drink down.</span></p><p><span>“You’re telling me academia is vicious?”</span></p><p><span>“Savage,” Agatha said. “They smile while sharpening knives.”</span></p><p><span>“Sounds familiar.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha studied her. “You don’t strike me as cutthroat.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shrugged. “I can be. When it matters.”</span></p><p><span>There was something in the way she said it, quiet, assured, that made Agatha’s chest tighten again.</span></p><p><span>They talked about New York, about Westview, about the scavenger hunt, skating, cider. About nothing and everything. The alcohol softened Agatha’s edges, made the words come easier, the laughter linger longer.</span></p><p><span>She caught herself leaning in.</span></p><p><span>Caught herself wanting to stay.</span></p><p><span>That was when it hit her.</span></p><p><span>This wasn’t harmless.</span></p><p><span>She’d known that, of course, intellectually, but this was different. This was the slow, insidious realization that she was comfortable. That she wasn’t performing or guarding or bracing for impact.</span></p><p><span>That she felt… seen.</span></p><p><span>Agatha took a longer sip of her drink.</span></p><p><span>Rio watched her over the rim of her glass. “You okay?”</span></p><p><span>“Yes,” Agatha said too quickly, then sighed. “No. I don’t know.”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t push. She never did. “That’s allowed.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a quiet, humorless laugh. “I’m very bad at wanting things.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s mouth curved, not teasing. “Most people are.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m worse than most.”</span></p><p><span>“Still human, though.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha met her gaze.</span></p><p><span>For a moment, the noise of the bar faded. The booth felt like its own small universe, dim, warm, suspended.</span></p><p><span>Agatha thought of Wanda. Of the house. Of the gala. Of all the ways she’d folded herself smaller this week.</span></p><p><span>Then she thought of this- of laughter, of cider and ice rinks, of a woman who met her where she stood and didn’t ask her to disappear.</span></p><p><span>Her throat tightened.</span></p><p><span>Rio broke the moment gently. “Hey. You said I owed you a drink.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. Then smirked. “I did.”</span></p><p><span>“Then we should probably order another.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded once. “Probably.”</span></p><p><span>She lifted a finger to catch the bartender’s attention, heart thudding a little too loudly in her chest.</span></p><p><span>Agatha was halfway through her second drink when the lights shifted.</span></p><p><span>Enough that the warm amber glow dimmed and a string of multicolored bulbs over the small stage flickered to life. Someone near the bar whooped. A few people clapped reflexively, like they’d been waiting for permission.</span></p><p><span>Agatha frowned into her glass. “What’s happening.”</span></p><p><span>Rio, who had just taken a sip of her own drink, nearly choked on it in excitement. “Oh my god,” she breathed. “Yes.”</span></p><p><span>“That does not answer my question.”</span></p><p><span>Rio was already twisting in the booth to look. “Christmas drag night,” she said, delighted. “They do it every December. Sometimes it’s carols, sometimes it’s chaos. Last year someone did a twelve-minute interpretive number to ‘Last Christmas.’”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. “I hate that song.”</span></p><p><span>“You’ll love this,” Rio promised, eyes shining.</span></p><p><span>Onstage, a group of drag performers emerged in full festive regalia: sparkling red suits, oversized belts, beards made of tinsel, hats stacked at impossible angles. One of them grabbed the mic with a flourish.</span></p><p><span>“WESTVIEW,” she boomed. “Have you been good this year?”</span></p><p><span>The crowd cheered.</span></p><p><span>“Have you been naughty?”</span></p><p><span>Louder cheers.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt something in her chest loosen despite herself. She took another sip of her drink and leaned back, watching.</span></p><p><span>The opening notes kicked in, bright, jaunty, unmistakable.</span></p><p><span>Agatha groaned softly. “No.”</span></p><p><span>Rio clapped once, thrilled. “YES.”</span></p><p><span>The drag queen launched into it with gusto. “Who’s got a beard that’s long and white?”</span></p><p><span>A few people shouted back, half-laughing. “Santa’s got a beard that’s long and white!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared.</span></p><p><span>“Oh no,” she said faintly. “It’s a call-and-response.”</span></p><p><span>Rio was already bouncing slightly in her seat. “Must Be Santa!” she sang back, loud and proud, pointing at the stage.</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned to her slowly. “You are not-”</span></p><p><span>Rio grinned at her. “You’re going to sing.”</span></p><p><span>“I absolutely am not.”</span></p><p><span>The performer onstage scanned the room theatrically, then pointed directly at their booth. “YOU,” she called. “In the power blazer.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nearly dropped her glass. “Oh my god.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed so hard she had to grab the table. “Power blazer,” she wheezed. “That’s you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha hissed, “I am begging you not to encourage this.”</span></p><p><span>Too late.</span></p><p><span>The drag queen sashayed closer to the edge of the stage, mic outstretched. “What’s your name, gorgeous?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha opened her mouth to refuse on principle.</span></p><p><span>Rio beat her to it. “AGATHA.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shot her a look that could curdle milk.</span></p><p><span>The performer’s eyes lit up. “Agatha! Honey. You look like someone who knows the answer.”</span></p><p><span>“I don’t,” Agatha said flatly.</span></p><p><span>“Who’s got a list that’s long and fair?” the performer prompted, holding the mic toward her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze. Every instinct screamed </span><em><span>no</span></em><span>. This was public. This was ridiculous. This was exactly the kind of thing she avoided.</span></p><p><span>She glanced at Rio.</span></p><p><span>Rio wasn’t laughing now. She was watching her, soft smile, eyebrows raised just slightly. A look that said </span><em><span>it’s okay</span></em><span>, without pressure. A look that made Agatha feel… steady.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sighed.</span></p><p><span>Into the mic, deadpan: “Santa’s got a list that’s long and fair.”</span></p><p><span>The crowd erupted.</span></p><p><span>Rio gasped like she’d just witnessed a miracle. “YES!”</span></p><p><span>The performer beamed. “That’s it! Again!”</span></p><p><span>And somehow, against her will, against her better judgment, Agatha kept going.</span></p><p><span>She sang the responses, voice low and dry but perfectly on pitch. She rolled her eyes dramatically. She delivered each line like it personally offended her. The audience ate it up.</span></p><p><span>Rio sang along at full volume beside her, utterly shameless, clapping on the beat, pointing at Agatha like she was the star of the show.</span></p><p><span>By the final “MUST BE SANTA,” Agatha was laughing too hard to pretend she wasn’t enjoying herself.</span></p><p><span>When the song ended, the performers took a bow. One of them blew Agatha a kiss. The crowd applauded, a little louder than necessary.</span></p><p><span>Agatha collapsed back into the booth, breathless. “I hate you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio wiped tears from her eyes. “You loved it.”</span></p><p><span>“I did not.”</span></p><p><span>“You absolutely did.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head, smiling despite herself. “I can’t believe you made me do that.”</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t make you,” Rio said lightly. “You chose joy.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted. “Let’s not get carried away.”</span></p><p><span>But something had shifted.</span></p><p><span>The tight coil in her chest, the one that had been there since the gala, since the mall, since Westview itself, had loosened. She felt lighter. Warmer. Like she’d stepped out of her own head for a moment and found the world hadn’t ended.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned back in the booth, still glowing. “You know,” she said, “for someone who claims to hate Christmas, you’re doing great.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha lifted her glass. “Don’t tell anyone. I have a reputation.”</span></p><p><span>They clinked drinks.</span></p><p><span>The performers launched into another number, louder this time, and the bar filled with noise and laughter. Agatha let it wash over her. For once, she didn’t feel like she needed to be elsewhere.</span></p><p><span>She looked at Rio, really looked at her. The way her eyes crinkled when she smiled. The way she moved through the world like it was friendly. The way she made space without demanding anything.</span></p><p><span>And somewhere deep inside, Agatha admitted something she’d been avoiding all day.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t want this to end.</span></p><p><span>The thought startled her enough that she looked away, down at the table, at their empty glasses.</span></p><p><span>“Hey,” she said, voice casual with effort. “You want another?”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s smile softened. “Yeah. I’d like that.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stood, feeling steady on her feet, and headed for the bar.</span></p><p><span>As she waited, she caught her reflection in the mirror behind the bottles. She looked… different. Less armored. Less alone.</span></p><p><span>When she returned with their drinks, she didn’t hesitate. She slid back into the booth, close enough that their knees brushed.</span></p><p><span>Neither of them moved away.</span></p><p><span>The conversation picked up again easily, stories, jokes, half-serious debates about the worst holiday movies. Agatha found herself talking about her students. Rio talked about her work, about Westview, about growing up here and leaving and coming back.</span></p><p><span>It felt… easy.</span></p><p><span>Dangerously so.</span></p><p><span>Agatha took a slow sip of her drink, heart beating a little faster than it should. Somewhere in the back of her mind, Lilia’s strange, unhelpful advice echoed, </span><em><span>sit in the booth</span></em><span>. As if closeness invited truth. As if some spaces were meant for things you didn’t say out loud yet.</span></p><p><span>She glanced at Rio, who was mid-sentence, gesturing animatedly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha cut her off mid-sentence.</span></p><p><span>“Hey-” she said quietly.</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked, still smiling from whatever story she’d been telling, her drink paused halfway to her lips. “Yeah?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t smile back. She watched the condensation slide down her glass instead. “What did you mean by </span><em><span>you can relate</span></em><span>?”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s expression shifted, not dramatically. Just a subtle recalibration. The smile softened, then faded into something more careful.</span></p><p><span>“Outside,” Agatha clarified, voice low. “At the gala. You said you could relate.”</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned back against the booth, one arm draped along the vinyl seat. For a moment she looked like she might deflect, make a joke, say </span><em><span>oh, nothing</span></em><span>, wave it away like she had before.</span></p><p><span>Instead, she studied Agatha’s face.</span></p><p><span>“What do you know?” Rio asked gently.</span></p><p><span>Agatha frowned. “About… you and Wanda?”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded.</span></p><p><span>Agatha hesitated, then shrugged. “That you were childhood best friends. That you dated for a bit in high school. That it didn’t work out and you drifted.” She paused. “That’s the version everyone seems comfortable telling.”</span></p><p><span>Rio huffed out a quiet, humorless laugh. “Yeah. That tracks.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha finally looked up. “So?”</span></p><p><span>“So,” Rio echoed, rolling the word around like she was testing its weight. She picked up her drink again, took a slow sip, then set it down untouched. “That’s not wrong. It’s just… incomplete.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t interrupt. She went very still, the way she did when she was listening, really listening.</span></p><p><span>Rio glanced toward the bar, where the drag performers were taking a break, then back to Agatha. Her voice dropped, but it didn’t shake.</span></p><p><span>“We did date,” she said. “Sort of. We were sixteen. It was… intense. Sneaking around, passing notes, late-night phone calls where neither of us said anything but we stayed on the line anyway.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.</span></p><p><span>“Wanda was terrified,” Rio continued. “Not of me. Not of being with me. Just… of anyone knowing. Her mom. Her friends. The town. Westview has eyes everywhere, you know?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a dry breath. “I’m learning.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled faintly, then pressed on. “So we kept it secret. Always secret. I thought-” She stopped herself, shook her head. “I told myself it was temporary. That once we graduated, once we got out, it would be different.”</span></p><p><span>She looked down at her hands. “Then one day, during chemistry class, a note fell out of Wanda’s binder.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s stomach dropped.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t rush the next part. “I’d written it. Something stupid and earnest. Hearts over i’s. ‘I love you’ written like it meant everything. Because to me, it did.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed.</span></p><p><span>“There was this girl,” Rio said. “Popular. Loud. The kind who makes a show out of everything. She picked it up before Wanda even realized it had fallen.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s mouth twitched. “And suddenly everyone’s watching.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed her eyes briefly.</span></p><p><span>“Wanda panicked,” Rio said softly. “She laughed. She said-” Her voice caught, just for a second. “She said I was obsessed with her. That I wouldn’t leave her alone. That I made it all up.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha went rigid.</span></p><p><span>“She said I was confusing friendship for something else,” Rio continued. “That I was embarrassing her.”</span></p><p><span>The booth felt very small all of a sudden.</span></p><p><span>“I remember the exact way she said my name,” Rio said. “Like it was a problem she needed to get rid of.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s fingers curled around her glass so tightly her knuckles went white.</span></p><p><span>“She started dating Vision a week later,” Rio went on. “Everyone loved them. They made sense. Football games, pep rallies, the whole thing. She was happier. Or at least… she looked happier.”</span></p><p><span>Her laugh this time was sharp. “And I was suddenly the weird lesbian who couldn’t take a hint. The girl who made her straight best friend uncomfortable.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t move.</span></p><p><span>“I ate lunch in the art room for the rest of junior year,” Rio said. “People whispered. Teachers looked at me like I was fragile or contagious. And Wanda?” She shrugged. “She didn’t look at me at all.”</span></p><p><span>Silence fell between them.</span></p><p><span>Not the warm, easy silence from lunch. Not the kind shaped like possibility.</span></p><p><span>This one was heavy. Dense. Charged.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at the table, jaw clenched so tight it ached. Her mind replayed a dozen moments from the past week, Wanda’s tight smiles, her quick denials, the way she’d dropped Agatha’s hand in public like it burned.</span></p><p><span>Rio watched her carefully now. “You don’t have to say anything,” she added. “I didn’t tell you that to-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha lifted her head.</span></p><p><span>Her eyes were dark. Sharp. Unreadable.</span></p><p><span>“That,” she said slowly, “is not drifting apart.”</span></p><p><span>Rio exhaled, a sound halfway between a sigh and a laugh. “No.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s betrayal,” Agatha continued. “That’s… erasure.”</span></p><p><span>Rio winced. “I don’t hate her,” she said quickly, like she needed Agatha to know. “I really don’t. I know she was scared. I know her family. I know this town.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s mouth twisted. “Fear doesn’t absolve cruelty.”</span></p><p><span>Rio studied her, something soft and sad flickering across her face. “You really are a professor.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t smile.</span></p><p><span>She sat there, silent in a way that felt deliberate. Dangerous. Like a storm deciding whether or not to break.</span></p><p><span>Finally, she spoke. “That’s what you meant.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded. “Yeah.”</span></p><p><span>“When you said you could relate,” Agatha said quietly.</span></p><p><span>“Yes.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned back against the booth, staring at the ceiling like it might offer answers. Her chest felt tight. Old, familiar aches stirred, memories of her own she hadn’t invited to the table.</span></p><p><span>She let out a slow breath. “I’m sorry,” she said, and meant it with a depth that surprised even her.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s shoulders eased, just a fraction. “Thank you.”</span></p><p><span>They sat there for another moment, the music swelling back up around them, the bar alive and loud and oblivious.</span></p><p><span>Agatha finally picked up her drink and took a long swallow.</span></p><p><span>Then, without looking at Rio, she said, “She’s very good at pretending things didn’t happen.”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t answer right away.</span></p><p><span>“No,” she said eventually. “She’s very good at surviving.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s grip tightened again.</span></p><p><span>“And so are you,” Rio added.</span></p><p><span>Agatha glanced at her then, really looked. Saw the steadiness beneath the warmth, the old scars woven into the easy charm.</span></p><p><span>Something in her chest shifted. Settled.</span></p><p><span>She raised her glass slightly. “To surviving,” she said dryly.</span></p><p><span>Rio clinked hers against it. “To not letting it make us smaller.”</span></p><p><span>Their eyes held.</span></p><p><span>Neither of them looked away first.</span></p><p><span>Rio waited a beat.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t the kind of pause that came from not knowing what to say. It was the careful kind, the kind where you check the ground before you step, make sure you’re not about to break something fragile.</span></p><p><span>“Can I ask you something?” she said finally.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t look up right away. She was tracing the rim of her glass with one finger, the condensation cold against her skin. After a second, she nodded once. “Okay.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shifted in the booth, angling her body just slightly closer without touching. “You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to. I really mean that.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha huffed softly. “You’re already qualifying. That usually means the question’s loaded.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled, but it was nervous. “A little. I’m trying not to be… invasive.”</span></p><p><span>“Go on,” Agatha said. Her voice was even, but there was something braced about it, like she’d already set her shoulders for impact.</span></p><p><span>Rio took a breath. “I was just wondering- about you. About… how you figured things out. And how your family took it.”</span></p><p><span>The words landed quietly.</span></p><p><span>Too quietly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha went still.</span></p><p><span>Not tense- frozen. As if someone had pressed pause on her mid-breath. Her finger stopped moving. Her shoulders locked. Even her expression went carefully blank, the practiced neutrality of someone who had learned long ago how to disappear in plain sight.</span></p><p><span>Rio saw it instantly.</span></p><p><span>“Oh,” she said quickly, panic flickering across her face. “Hey- no, that’s- Agatha, I’m sorry. You don’t have to talk about it. I shouldn’t have-”</span></p><p><span>“It’s fine.”</span></p><p><span>The words came out automatically. Reflexive. Polite.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t buy it.</span></p><p><span>“I really didn’t mean to-”</span></p><p><span>“It’s fine,” Agatha repeated, a little sharper now, like she was trying to convince herself as much as Rio. She swallowed. “You didn’t do anything wrong.”</span></p><p><span>They sat there for a moment, the noise of the bar swelling around them, laughter, clinking glasses, a burst of applause from somewhere near the stage. Life continuing, utterly indifferent.</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled slowly.</span></p><p><span>“When I was in high school,” she said, “my mother found out.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s mouth closed gently. She didn’t interrupt.</span></p><p><span>“She went through my things. Read my journal. Found a letter I’d written to a girl I liked.” Agatha let out a humorless breath. “I wasn’t even brave enough to give it to her.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hands curled around her own glass.</span></p><p><span>“She didn’t ask questions,” Agatha continued. “Didn’t sit me down. She hit me. Slapped me so hard I fell into the dresser.” Her voice was steady in a way that suggested she’d told this story before- or maybe that she’d told it so many times in her head that it no longer surprised her. “And then she called me… things.”</span></p><p><span>She paused. Not because she was struggling to remember; because she was choosing not to say them.</span></p><p><span>“Disgusting,” she said instead. “Broken. A disappointment. She told me I was sick.”</span></p><p><span>Rio felt something in her chest crack open.</span></p><p><span>Agatha kept going, eyes fixed on the table now. “She said she could fix it. That she would fix it. Sent me to conversion therapy.”</span></p><p><span>Rio sucked in a breath before she could stop herself.</span></p><p><span>Agatha noticed. “Yeah,” she said quietly. “That.”</span></p><p><span>For the first time since she’d started talking, her voice wavered, not much, just enough to let the truth bleed through.</span></p><p><span>“It didn’t work,” she said. “Obviously. But it did teach me how to lie. How to keep my mouth shut. How to survive.”</span></p><p><span>She lifted her glass, took a small sip, then set it back down untouched. “I left the second I turned eighteen. Packed a bag, took a bus to New York, slept on a friend’s couch, and never went back.”</span></p><p><span>She finally looked up.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t know what she’d expected to see, anger, maybe, or devastation, but what she found instead was something quieter. Older. A kind of tired resilience that had been forged under pressure and never quite softened.</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t look back,” Agatha said. “Didn’t call. Didn’t visit. Built a life that didn’t include her.”</span></p><p><span>Rio was silent now. Completely. The words had hollowed her out, left her unsure where to even place her hands.</span></p><p><span>“I’m sorry,” she said finally, and the words felt painfully insufficient.</span></p><p><span>Agatha gave a small shrug. “It was a long time ago.”</span></p><p><span>That wasn’t true. Not really. But it was the version she’d learned to live with.</span></p><p><span>Rio studied her face, her expression full of something dangerously close to pity.</span></p><p><span>Agatha caught it immediately.</span></p><p><span>“No,” she said, sharper now. “Don’t do that.”</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked. “Do what?”</span></p><p><span>“That look.” Agatha shook her head. “I don’t need it. I don’t want it.”</span></p><p><span>“I wasn’t-”</span></p><p><span>“I know,” Agatha said more gently. “But I’m fine. Really. I survived. I got out. I built something good. I’m not… broken.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded slowly. “I didn’t think you were.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha hesitated, then added, quieter, “It just means I learned early that being yourself can cost you everything. So you get… careful.”</span></p><p><span>Something passed between them then. Not spoken, but understood.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned back slightly, giving Agatha space again. “That makes sense,” she said. “More sense than it should.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s mouth twitched. “Story of my life.”</span></p><p><span>They sat there for a moment longer, the weight of what had been shared settling between them, not heavy exactly, but real.</span></p><p><span>Then Rio reached for her glass and lifted it. “For what it’s worth,” she said softly, “I’m really glad you’re here.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha met her gaze.</span></p><p><span>“So am I,” she said, really meaning it.</span></p><p><span>Agatha let the silence stretch.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t a tactic. It wasn’t punishment. It was simply the only thing her body knew how to do after a confession like that, after hearing something that slid so neatly into the hollow place already carved out in her chest.</span></p><p><span>The bar hummed around them. Glasses clinked. Someone laughed too loudly near the dartboard. A Christmas song drifted overhead, slowed down and smoky, stripped of cheer.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t rush her.</span></p><p><span>That, more than anything, felt dangerous.</span></p><p><span>Agatha finally exhaled, slow and deliberate, like she was easing herself down a steep staircase. “I do understand her,” she said quietly.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes lifted, cautious.</span></p><p><span>“I understand the fear,” Agatha continued. “The calculations. The way you’re always bracing for the moment when honesty costs you something you can’t afford to lose.”</span></p><p><span>She swallowed, fingers tightening around her glass.</span></p><p><span>“What I don’t understand,” she said, voice sharpening just a little, “is why she keeps deciding that cost is me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t interrupt. She didn’t offer apologies or defenses. She just listened, steady and open, the way she always seemed to be.</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a breath that wobbled despite her best efforts. “I fought for this. For myself. For the right to exist without apologizing. And being here- being with her family- it’s like being shoved backward into a version of myself I barely survived.”</span></p><p><span>She shook her head once, a humorless huff escaping her. “I thought I was done with closets.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded slowly. “Yeah.”</span></p><p><span>That single word held so much understanding it almost knocked the wind out of her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha glanced at the clock behind the bar, then back at her drink. It had gone warm. Flat. She pushed it away.</span></p><p><span>“It’s late,” she said. “I should probably head back before someone starts wondering where I ran off to.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s mouth curved into a small, reluctant smile. “Responsible.”</span></p><p><span>“Debatable,” Agatha muttered, already sliding off the booth seat.</span></p><p><span>They paid, bundled back into coats, and stepped outside together.</span></p><p><span>The cold hit like a slap, sharp, bracing, honest. Snow dusted the sidewalk, crunching softly under their boots. The bar’s neon sign flickered behind them, red and green bleeding into the night.</span></p><p><span>They stood there for a moment, neither quite ready to leave.</span></p><p><span>Agatha shoved her hands into her coat pockets, rocking slightly on her heels. “Thank you,” she said. “For today. For… all of it.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s smile softened. “Anytime.”</span></p><p><span>There was another pause. One that felt heavier. Charged.</span></p><p><span>Then Rio leaned in.</span></p><p><span>It was gentle. Careful. Like she was offering Agatha a question rather than an answer.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t think.</span></p><p><span>She just tilted forward and met her halfway.</span></p><p><span>The kiss was warm despite the cold, slow and unhurried. Rio’s hand came up to rest at Agatha’s waist, grounding, present. Agatha’s breath hitched, a quiet sound she didn’t bother swallowing.</span></p><p><span>For one perfect, suspended second, there was no Westview. No family expectations. No closets. Just this- this choice, this warmth, this impossible clarity.</span></p><p><span>Then Rio pulled back.</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked, stunned, her body still leaning forward like it hadn’t received the memo.</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled, soft, sincere, a little sad around the edges. “Goodnight, Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>She stepped back before Agatha could respond, before she could overthink, before the moment could turn into something that required explanation.</span></p><p><span>“And-” Rio added, already turning away, “thank you. For today.”</span></p><p><span>Then she was gone, disappearing down the street, boots crunching through snow, leaving Agatha standing under the flickering neon with a racing heart and a thousand unfinished thoughts.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stayed there long after the cold seeped through her coat.</span></p><p><span>Then, finally, she exhaled.</span></p><p><span>“Well,” she murmured to the empty street.</span></p>

<p><span>Agatha stood outside the bar long after Rio disappeared.</span></p><p><span>The cold bit immediately, sharp, clean, grounding, but it did nothing to stop the way her thoughts kept skidding, looping, crashing into each other like poorly stacked plates. Her breath fogged in front of her face. Her hands were shoved deep into her coat pockets, fingers curled tight, knuckles aching.</span></p><p><span>She could still feel it.</span></p><p><span>The kiss hadn’t been dramatic. No fireworks. No grand declaration. Just warm and soft and sure, like Rio had known exactly where to stand and how long to linger and when to pull away before it tipped into something that couldn’t be undone.</span></p><p><span>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut.</span></p><p><em><span>Get it together.</span></em></p><p><span>She opened them again and looked down the street. Westview at night was aggressively charming, twinkle lights strung across lampposts, storefront windows glowing with paper snowflakes and hand-lettered signs, the faint sound of music drifting from somewhere near the square. It felt staged. Like a set built to convince people that nothing bad ever happened here.</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned away from the bar and started walking.</span></p><p><span>Her boots clicked against the sidewalk, the sound steady, grounding. She aimed herself toward the town square without fully deciding to- muscle memory, maybe, or avoidance. Anything was better than standing still.</span></p><p><span>The kiss replayed anyway.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaning in, hesitant only for half a second. The way her hand had brushed Agatha’s sleeve, not gripping, just there. The warmth. The quiet.</span></p><p><span>Agatha groaned under her breath. “Of course,” she muttered. “Of course this is how my life goes.”</span></p><p><span>She passed a shop window filled with ceramic reindeer wearing scarves. Her reflection stared back at her, coat pulled tight, hair a little wind-tossed, eyes too bright. She barely recognized herself.</span></p><p><em><span>Do I have feelings for Rio?</span></em></p><p><span>The question landed like a dropped plate, loud, unavoidable.</span></p><p><span>Agatha scoffed. “No,” she said out loud, to no one. “Absolutely not.”</span></p><p><span>She kept walking.</span></p><p><span>Because that would be ridiculous. Impractical. Inconvenient. She had come to Westview with Wanda. She was still technically Wanda’s girlfriend, even if the word had been stripped of its meaning and packed away like a forbidden decoration.</span></p><p><span>Rio was… Rio was just kind. Easy. Safe in a way that felt unfairly seductive. She laughed at Agatha’s jokes. She didn’t flinch at her sharp edges. She saw her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha grimaced.</span></p><p><span>That didn’t mean anything.</span></p><p><span>Right?</span></p><p><span>She reached the edge of the square. The Christmas tree still stood tall at its center, lights glowing softly, branches heavy with ornaments the town had deemed </span><em><span>tasteful.</span></em><span> The ice rink was empty now, the surface scuffed and dull under the lights.</span></p><p><span>Her chest tightened at the memory- Rio’s hands steadying her, laughter ringing out, Agatha clinging to her like dignity was optional.</span></p><p><span>She pressed her lips together hard.</span></p><p><span>“Stop,” she told herself. “Just- stop.”</span></p><p><span>Because the problem wasn’t Rio.</span></p><p><span>The problem was Wanda.</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned against the low stone wall that ringed the square and stared at the tree. Her breath slowed, then stuttered again as Wanda’s face slid uninvited into her thoughts, Wanda at the gala, laughing with Vision, her hand resting easily on his arm. Wanda dropping Agatha’s hand at the restaurant. Wanda not correcting anyone. Wanda not defending her.</span></p><p><span>And Wanda this morning, choosing Vision again, without even seeming to realize it was a choice.</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed.</span></p><p><span>She understood fear. God, did she understand it. She understood self-preservation, the instinct to hide what could get you hurt. She’d built her entire life around surviving that knowledge.</span></p><p><span>But understanding didn’t mean it didn’t hurt.</span></p><p><span>She dragged a hand down her face. “You’re not jealous,” she murmured. “You’re just… displaced.”</span></p><p><span>That was it. That had to be it.</span></p><p><span>Rio wasn’t Wanda.</span></p><p><span>Rio hadn’t spent the last year wrapped up in late-night talks and shared groceries and half-finished mugs of coffee. Rio hadn’t learned Agatha’s tells or the exact way she liked her toast or how she pretended not to care when she absolutely did.</span></p><p><span>Rio was just there when Wanda wasn’t.</span></p><p><span>Agatha pushed off the wall and started walking again, circling the square slowly this time. Her footsteps echoed faintly, the night otherwise quiet.</span></p><p><em><span>But the kiss…</span></em></p><p><span>She stopped short.</span></p><p><span>Because if it had just been about absence, about wanting something Wanda wasn’t giving her, then the kiss would’ve felt wrong. Like stealing. Like settling.</span></p><p><span>It hadn’t.</span></p><p><span>That was the problem.</span></p><p><span>Agatha hugged her arms tighter around herself. She could still hear Rio’s voice, </span><em><span>thank you for today</span></em><span>, soft, sincere, like it meant something.</span></p><p><span>She laughed quietly, bitter and breathless. “Fantastic,” she whispered. “Just fantastic.”</span></p><p><span>She didn’t want the day to end.</span></p><p><span>That truth sat heavy and undeniable in her chest.</span></p><p><span>Not the bar. Not the drinks. The day. The wandering through shops, the cider, the stupid sandwich she’d pretended to hate. The ease of it. The way she hadn’t once felt like she was being minimized or hidden or tolerated.</span></p><p><span>She slowed as she passed the café where they’d met earlier. The windows were dark now, chairs stacked, the smell of spices lingering faintly in the air.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stopped again.</span></p><p><em><span>Am I falling for Rio…</span></em></p><p><span>-or was she just realizing how lonely she’d been?</span></p><p><span>She closed her eyes and let the cold seep in, grounding her again. Her mother’s voice echoed unbidden, sharp, cruel, long buried but never gone. The fear. The hiding. The work it had taken to claw her way into a life where she didn’t have to apologize for who she loved.</span></p><p><span>Being back in Westview had scraped all of that raw.</span></p><p><span>Being back in the closet, even temporarily, had cracked something open she’d spent years sealing shut.</span></p><p><span>Of course Rio felt like oxygen.</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled slowly.</span></p><p><span>“I don’t get to do this,” she told herself. “I don’t get to blow everything up because I’m hurting.”</span></p><p><span>She straightened, squared her shoulders, and finally turned toward the path back to the Maximoff house.</span></p><p><span>The lights behind her faded as she walked, replaced by quiet residential streets and softly glowing windows. Somewhere in the distance, a car passed. Snow crunched faintly under her boots.</span></p><p><span>She replayed the kiss one last time- not to torture herself, but to understand it.</span></p><p><span>There had been no urgency in it. No desperation. Just choice.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s throat tightened.</span></p><p><span>That scared her more than anything else.</span></p><p><span>By the time the Maximoff house came into view, she’d made exactly zero decisions, but the spiral had slowed, settling into something heavier, more contemplative.</span></p><p><span>She paused at the gate and looked back once, toward the town square she could no longer see.</span></p><p><span>“I don’t know what this means,” she whispered to the cold night.</span></p><p><span>Then she turned, steeled herself, and went inside, already knowing she was fighting a losing battle.</span></p><p><span>Agatha slipped inside the house like a ghost, easing the door shut behind her until the latch clicked softly into place. The air was still, heavy with the aftertaste of the day, pine cleaner, cold wool coats, the faint sweetness of leftover cider. No voices. No laughter. Just the low hum of the heater and the creak of settling wood.</span></p><p><span>She toed off her boots, wincing at the quiet thud they made on the mat, then padded toward the stairs. Every step felt deliberate, rehearsed. She told herself, again, that she was only going up there to grab her things. That she didn’t need to say anything. That honesty, tonight, could wait.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s bedroom door was closed, but a thin line of light spilled out from beneath it.</span></p><p><span>Agatha slowed.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hand was still on the doorknob when she saw Wanda.</span></p><p><span>Wanda was sitting on the edge of the bed.</span></p><p><span>Not scrolling. Not pacing. Not pretending.</span></p><p><span>Crying.</span></p><p><span>Full, shaking sobs she clearly hadn’t meant for anyone to see, shoulders caving inward, one hand clamped over her mouth like she was trying to keep the sound from spilling out into the house. Her other hand was twisted in the hem of her sweater, knuckles white, like if she let go she might come apart completely.</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze.</span></p><p><span>Every thought she’d had on the walk back collapsed instantly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stood there longer than was reasonable.</span></p><p><span>Long enough for the silence to settle into her bones. Long enough for the shape of Wanda, curled inward on the edge of the bed, shoulders shaking, hands fisted in the hem of her sweater, to burn itself into Agatha’s vision like an afterimage.</span></p><p><span>She hadn’t expected this.</span></p><p><span>She’d braced herself for a thousand versions of Wanda: defensive, brittle, closed-off, overly cheerful, distant. She had not prepared for this- raw, cracked open, crying so hard it looked like it hurt.</span></p><p><span>“Wanda,” Agatha said finally, softly, like she was afraid the word itself might shatter something.</span></p><p><span>Wanda startled, jerking her head up. Her eyes were red-rimmed, swollen, mascara smudged in dark crescents beneath them. She looked younger like this. Smaller. Guilty in a way that made Agatha’s chest ache despite herself.</span></p><p><span>“Oh,” Wanda said, scrambling upright, wiping at her face with the heel of her hand. “I- I didn’t hear you come in.”</span></p><p><span>“I can see that,” Agatha said gently, stepping into the room and closing the door behind her without thinking.</span></p><p><span>The click sounded too loud.</span></p><p><span>They stood there, a few feet apart, neither quite knowing what to do with their hands. Wanda’s gaze darted everywhere but Agatha’s face.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tried again. “Hey. What’s- what happened?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda laughed, a thin, broken sound that didn’t match anything resembling humor. “Nothing. I’m fine.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha tilted her head. “You’re crying.”</span></p><p><span>“That doesn’t-” Wanda shook her head, words tangling. “That doesn’t mean anything.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha sighed, crossing the room slowly and sitting beside her on the bed, not touching, but close enough to be felt. “It usually does.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda pressed her lips together, nodding too fast. “I just- this trip is a lot. Everything is a lot. My parents, the party, Vision, you-” She cut herself off abruptly, panic flaring across her face. “I didn’t mean-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha held up a hand. “Wanda. Breathe.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda inhaled shakily. Exhaled. Then inhaled again like she was bracing against a wave.</span></p><p><span>“I’m just scared,” Wanda said, finally. “I’m so scared all the time lately.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha softened despite herself. “Of what?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda laughed again, bitter this time. “Of messing everything up. Of losing people. Of losing you.”</span></p><p><span>That landed hard.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s jaw tightened, but she kept her voice even. “You’re not losing me.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda turned then, finally meeting her eyes. There was desperation there. Fear. Something pleading.</span></p><p><span>“I don’t want to,” Wanda said quickly. “I don’t want to lose you. You’re- Agatha, you’re the best thing in my life.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s throat closed. She swallowed. “Okay.”</span></p><p><span>“I love you,” Wanda said, the words tumbling out in a rush. “I love you so much. I don’t know how to make everything work, but I do know that I don’t want my life without you in it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s heart stuttered painfully.</span></p><p><span>She reached out without thinking, resting her hand on Wanda’s wrist. Wanda clutched onto it immediately, like a lifeline.</span></p><p><span>“Hey,” Agatha murmured. “Slow down.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda shook her head. “I’m serious. I know I mess up. I know I should have defended you to my parents, and at the gala, and- God, I know I should have said something a hundred times already, but I just-” Her voice broke. “I don’t want my family to hate me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha winced.</span></p><p><span>“They wouldn’t,” she said automatically, though she didn’t fully believe it.</span></p><p><span>Wanda laughed weakly. “You don’t know that.”</span></p><p><span>“I know they love you,” Agatha said. “Even when they’re… like this.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda stared down at their joined hands. “What if that love has conditions?”</span></p><p><span>The words echoed too closely to something Agatha knew intimately.</span></p><p><span>She squeezed Wanda’s wrist gently. “Then that’s not on you.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s breath hitched. “I just keep thinking- if I could do everything right, if I could just make everyone happy, then maybe-”</span></p><p><span>“Wanda,” Agatha interrupted softly. “That road doesn’t end.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda looked up, eyes glassy. “I don’t know how to choose.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt the familiar ache, the one that had followed her since Westview, since the gala, since the balcony, since the kiss she hadn’t told Wanda about.</span></p><p><span>“I’m not asking you to choose,” Agatha said carefully.</span></p><p><span>Wanda shook her head. “It feels like I am. All the time.”</span></p><p><span>They sat in silence for a moment, Wanda’s grip tightening on Agatha’s wrist, her thumb tracing anxious circles like she was trying to anchor herself.</span></p><p><span>Agatha brushed a loose strand of hair from Wanda’s face, unable to stop herself. “Did something happen tonight?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda flinched.</span></p><p><span>That was answer enough.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s stomach dropped. “Wanda.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda pulled her hand back, standing abruptly and pacing the room. “I didn’t mean for it to. It just- he was there, and everyone kept talking about us like we were- like we were this perfect thing, and I got overwhelmed and-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stood too, pulse roaring in her ears. “What did you do?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda turned, tears spilling over again. “I was confused. And drunk. And stupid.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s voice came out quieter than she expected. “What happened?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda opened her mouth. Closed it. Ran a hand through her hair, pacing again like a trapped animal.</span></p><p><span>“I love you,” she said again, desperately. “Please know that. This doesn’t change that.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt cold creep up her spine. “Wanda.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda stopped pacing.</span></p><p><span>Her shoulders slumped, like the fight had finally gone out of her.</span></p><p><span>“I kissed him,” Wanda said.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t remember deciding to raise her voice.</span></p><p><span>It just… happened.</span></p><p><span>One second she was standing there, Wanda’s words still ringing in her ears, </span><em><span>I kissed him</span></em><span>, and the next, something inside her finally snapped clean in half.</span></p><p><span>“You-” Agatha started, then stopped, a sharp, humorless laugh tearing out of her instead. “You </span><em><span>what</span></em><span>?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda flinched like she’d been struck. She had moved back to the edge of the bed, shoulders caved in, eyes red and wet, hands clenched in the fabric of her dress. She looked small. Guilty. Terrified.</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t mean-” Wanda said quickly. “Agatha, I swear, it just-”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, don’t,” Agatha cut in, her voice already climbing, sharp and brittle. “Do </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> start with that.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda scrambled to her feet. “Please, just- lower your voice, okay? My parents-”</span></p><p><span>“No.” Agatha’s voice cracked, loud and raw and utterly done. “No, actually, I don’t think I will.”</span></p><p><span>She laughed again, harsher this time, and ran a hand through her hair, pacing the small room like a caged animal. “Do you have </span><em><span>any</span></em><span> idea, any idea, what this week has been like for me?”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha-”</span></p><p><span>“I have stood in your parents’ house,” Agatha went on, voice rising with every word, “and smiled while they introduced me as your </span><em><span>roommate</span></em><span>. I have listened to them gush about your ex-boyfriend like he’s some golden retriever who cured cancer. I have slept on a couch like a dirty little secret because you were too scared to let them think we share a bed.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s face crumpled. “I was trying to protect us-”</span></p><p><span>“Protect </span><em><span>who</span></em><span>?” Agatha shot back. “Because it sure as hell hasn’t been me.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda took a step toward her, hands raised, pleading. “I love you. That’s all I was trying to do. I didn’t want to lose you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha whirled on her. “Then why does it feel like you’ve been losing me on purpose?”</span></p><p><span>That landed. Hard.</span></p><p><span>Wanda sucked in a breath, like she’d been punched, and shook her head desperately. “It was a mistake. The kiss- I didn’t want it to happen, it just- he was there, and everyone kept saying how perfect we were, and I panicked and-”</span></p><p><span>“You panicked,” Agatha echoed. Her voice went eerily flat for a split second. Then it exploded again. “So your solution was to kiss your ex?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda started crying harder, hands covering her mouth. “I was scared.”</span></p><p><span>“I know you were scared,” Agatha yelled. “That’s the problem. You’re </span><em><span>always</span></em><span> scared.”</span></p><p><span>She stopped pacing and planted herself in front of Wanda, close enough that Wanda had to look at her. Agatha’s chest was heaving now, every breath burning.</span></p><p><span>“You’re scared of your parents. You’re scared of this town. You’re scared of what people think. And every single time, you choose </span><em><span>them</span></em><span> over me.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s not fair,” Wanda sobbed.</span></p><p><span>“It’s exactly fair,” Agatha shot back. “You asked me to come here. You dragged me into this house, into this town, into your life- and then you shoved me into the closet and told me to be grateful you left the door cracked.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda shook her head, tears streaming freely now. “I didn’t shove you-”</span></p><p><span>“Yes, you did,” Agatha said fiercely. “Every time you called me your friend. Every time you didn’t correct them. Every time you dropped my hand in public like it burned you.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda reached for her. Agatha stepped back.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t,” Agatha warned, her voice breaking despite herself. “Don’t touch me right now.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s hands fell uselessly to her sides. “I didn’t think-”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Agatha said, bitter and sharp. “You didn’t.”</span></p><p><span>She laughed again, but this time it was hollow, devastated. “Do you know how hard I fought to be out? To be </span><em><span>me</span></em><span>? I left my home at eighteen with nothing but a suitcase because it was safer than staying somewhere that hated me for existing. And I thought-” Her voice wavered, just for a second. “I thought you understood that.”</span></p><p><span>“I do,” Wanda cried. “I swear I do.”</span></p><p><span>“If you did,” Agatha snapped, “you wouldn’t have asked me to disappear for you.”</span></p><p><span>Silence crashed into the room, heavy and suffocating.</span></p><p><span>Wanda sank back onto the bed, shoulders shaking, sobs tearing out of her now without restraint. “I never wanted to hurt you,” she whispered. “I love you so much.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed her eyes, swallowing hard. “Love isn’t enough if you keep choosing fear.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda looked up at her, desperate. “What do you want me to do?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha opened her eyes.</span></p><p><span>“I wanted you to choose me,” she said quietly. Then, the volume came back, raw and furious. “Just once. I wanted you to stand there, at that bar, at that gala, in front of your parents, and say </span><em><span>this is my girlfriend</span></em><span>. I wanted you to not kiss your ex-boyfriend the second things got hard.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda pressed her hands to her face, sobbing openly now. “I’m sorry.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s chest ached. Her throat burned. Every word felt like it was tearing something out of her.</span></p><p><span>“You don’t get to keep apologizing while nothing changes,” Agatha said. “You don’t get to ask me to keep swallowing this.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda shook her head frantically. “Please, just- please don’t do this tonight. Not here. Not when my family-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed, loud and sharp. “Still worried about them.”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha, please,” Wanda begged, voice breaking. “You’re going to wake them up.”</span></p><p><span>“Good,” Agatha snapped. “Maybe then someone will finally see what you’re doing to me.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda flinched hard at that, curling in on herself.</span></p><p><span>Agatha kept going. She couldn’t stop now. Everything she’d swallowed since crossing the Westview town line came pouring out, ugly and honest and unstoppable.</span></p><p><span>“I am tired of shrinking for you,” she yelled. “I am tired of pretending I don’t exist. I am tired of watching you light up for everyone else while I get the leftovers. And I am </span><em><span>especially</span></em><span> tired of being made to feel like I’m unreasonable for wanting to be loved out loud.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda sobbed, shoulders shaking violently. “I didn’t mean to-”</span></p><p><span>“But you did,” Agatha said, voice cracking completely now. “You did.”</span></p><p><span>She stood there, shaking, tears burning behind her eyes, she refused to let fall.</span></p><p><span>Wanda looked utterly broken, crying silently now, eyes red and swollen, fear etched into every line of her face.</span></p><p><span>And still, still, Agatha couldn’t stop.</span></p><p><span>Because she’d been quiet for too long.</span></p><p><span>And she was done screaming into herself.</span></p><p><span>Agatha kept going.</span></p><p><span>The words didn’t come out clean or measured anymore, they came out jagged, breaking over each other, years of restraint cracking all at once.</span></p><p><span>“I have been shrinking myself for you,” she said hoarsely. “Every single day since we crossed that stupid town line. I let them call me your roommate. I let your mother lecture me like a misbehaving child. I let your ex-boyfriend sit across the room and laugh with you while I pretended I didn’t exist. I slept on a couch that feels like it was designed as a punishment. I stood in a closet like I was sixteen again-”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Wanda whispered, panicked, glancing toward the door. “Please- you’re going to wake everyone-”</span></p><p><span>“I don’t care,” Agatha snapped, voice cracking on the last word. “I don’t care if they hear. I don’t care if the whole house hears. I am done being quiet.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s hands fluttered uselessly at her sides, tears streaking down her face. “I was scared,” she sobbed. “I didn’t mean to- he kissed me and I-”</span></p><p><span>“You didn’t stop it,” Agatha cut in. That landed harder than shouting ever could. Her voice dropped, sharp and final. “That’s the part you don’t get to explain away.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s knees buckled slightly as she sat back down on the edge of the bed, shaking. “I love you,” she said desperately. “I love you. I just- I don’t know how to do this here. I don’t know how to be this version of myself in this house.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at her.</span></p><p><span>And then the anger finally ran out.</span></p><p><span>It didn’t vanish, it collapsed inward, leaving something raw and exposed behind it. Her chest tightened painfully, breath hitching as her eyes burned.</span></p><p><span>“Oh,” she whispered, suddenly. “Oh.”</span></p><p><span>She pressed a hand to her face, but it didn’t help. The sob tore out of her anyway, ugly, uncontrollable, the kind that left her shoulders shaking. She sank onto the bed, curling in on herself like she could fold small enough to disappear into the mattress.</span></p><p><span>Wanda immediately reached for her, but Agatha recoiled on instinct.</span></p><p><span>“No,” she said through tears. “No. Don’t.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda froze, hand suspended in the air.</span></p><p><span>“I can’t do this tonight,” Agatha continued, voice breaking. “I can’t comfort you about the damage you did to me.”</span></p><p><span>“I’ll sleep on the couch,” Wanda said quickly, as if it were an offering. “I’ll go right now-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha lifted her head, eyes red and furious and exhausted. “ Well, I am not sleeping on the couch tonight.”</span></p><p><span>The words hung there.</span></p><p><span>Wanda swallowed, nodded immediately. “Okay. Okay. I’ll- yeah. I’ll go.”</span></p><p><span>She stood too fast, nearly knocking into the dresser, hands trembling as she grabbed her phone and a sweater. She didn’t argue. She didn’t hesitate. She didn’t look back.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” she said softly from the doorway, voice wrecked.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t answer.</span></p><p><span>The door closed with a quiet click.</span></p><p><span>The silence that followed was deafening.</span></p><p><span>Agatha collapsed fully onto the bed, pulling the comforter around herself like armor, sobs wracking her body now that there was no one left to witness them. Her face pressed into the pillow that still smelled faintly like Wanda, clean laundry and something sweet, and she hated that even now, even like this, it made her ache.</span></p><p><span>Her thoughts wouldn’t slow.</span></p><p><span>The kiss replayed unbidden, cold air, Rio’s mouth warm and sure, the way Agatha hadn’t pulled away. The way she’d leaned in.</span></p><p><span>God.</span></p><p><span>She squeezed her eyes shut, another sob tearing free.</span></p><p><span>“I wish you were here,” she whispered into the dark, not sure if she meant Rio, or a version of herself who hadn’t learned to survive by disappearing.</span></p><p><span>Outside, Westview slept on, snow drifting quietly past the window.</span></p><p><span>Agatha lay awake, shaking, heart split clean down the middle- between what she had lost, and what she was terrified she might already be reaching for.</span></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>Christmas Eve morning arrived without ceremony.</span></p><p><span>Agatha woke slowly, dragged up from sleep by the faint creak of the bedroom door and the soft shuffle of movement that didn’t belong to her dreams. Her body felt heavy, leaden in that particular way that came after crying yourself hollow and then trying to sleep inside the wreckage. Her eyes burned. Her throat felt raw. The bed beneath her was warm on one side, empty on the other.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t open her eyes right away.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t have to.</span></p><p><span>She knew it was Wanda by the way the air in the room shifted, by the careful quiet of her steps, by the way she seemed to hold her breath like even existing too loudly might cause damage. The light clicked on low, not bright enough to be kind, not dim enough to hide anything.</span></p><p><span>Agatha lay still, staring at the inside of her eyelids, listening.</span></p><p><span>Fabric rustled. A sweater slipped off. Something zipped. Wanda was changing, trying to be unobtrusive in a room that had held too much honesty the night before. The sound of her movements tugged at Agatha’s chest in a way she didn’t appreciate.</span></p><p><span>The bed dipped.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes snapped open.</span></p><p><span>Wanda sat on the edge of the mattress, already dressed: soft sweater, jeans, hair pulled back hastily like she hadn’t trusted herself to spend too long on it. Her face looked pale in the low light, eyes rimmed red in a way that mirrored Agatha’s own.</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t mean to wake you,” Wanda said quietly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t respond.</span></p><p><span>Wanda hesitated, then turned toward her fully. She studied Agatha’s face for a long, careful moment, like she was bracing herself for something sharp. Her hand lifted, paused, then settled gently into Agatha’s hair, brushing it back from her forehead.</span></p><p><span>The touch was tentative. Apologetic.</span></p><p><span>Agatha flinched anyway.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s hand stilled. “I’m sorry,” she murmured, pulling back slightly. “I just- I wanted to see if you were okay.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha pushed herself up onto her elbows, the movement stiff and graceless. The blanket slid down, cool air kissing her skin. Wanda’s eyes flicked over her face, and whatever she saw there made her breath catch.</span></p><p><span>“Oh,” Wanda whispered.</span></p><p><span>Agatha could see it then, the realization. The swollen eyes. The blotchy skin. The undeniable evidence of how badly the night had gone.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s expression crumpled. “Agatha…” Her voice wavered. “I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have- I never should have-”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Agatha said sharply.</span></p><p><span>The word cracked through the quiet room like a whip.</span></p><p><span>Wanda froze.</span></p><p><span>Agatha swung her legs over the side of the bed and sat up fully, her back straight, her hands clenched tightly in the sheets like she needed the anchor. The anger that had been simmering just beneath the surface all morning surged up, hot and insistent.</span></p><p><span>“No,” she repeated, louder now. “Don’t.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda blinked, startled. “I was just trying to-”</span></p><p><span>“I know what you’re trying to do,” Agatha snapped. “You’re trying to apologize again so you can feel better about it.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s not fair,” Wanda said softly, immediately defensive.</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed, short and humorless. “Oh, it’s perfectly fair.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s hand hovered uselessly between them. “Agatha, please. I messed up. I know I did. I was scared and I made a stupid mistake and I hate myself for it-”</span></p><p><span>“Stop,” Agatha cut in, her voice rising despite herself. “Just- stop talking about how bad you feel for one second.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda recoiled slightly, hurt flashing across her face. “I’m allowed to feel bad.”</span></p><p><span>“Of course you are,” Agatha shot back. “You always are. You feel bad, and then everyone bends over backward to make it better for you.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s not true.”</span></p><p><span>“Isn’t it?” Agatha demanded, standing now, unable to sit still with this buzzing fury in her chest. “Because from where I’m standing, that seems to be the pattern. You do something that hurts me, and then I’m the one who ends up consoling you.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s eyes filled again. “I love you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha flinched harder at that than she had at the touch.</span></p><p><span>“I know,” she said, voice trembling despite her best efforts. “And that’s the problem.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda frowned, confused. “How is that-”</span></p><p><span>“Because you love me,” Agatha continued, words spilling out now that the dam had cracked, “but you don’t choose me. Not when it matters.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s not fair,” Wanda whispered again.</span></p><p><span>Agatha rounded on her. “You kissed him.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s breath hitched.</span></p><p><span>“You kissed your ex-boyfriend,” Agatha went on, every word burning. “The one singular day I spent away from you, trying to get a gift to please </span><em><span>your </span></em><span>family.”</span></p><p><span>“I was confused,” Wanda said desperately. “He just- he was there, and everything felt familiar, and I panicked-”</span></p><p><span>“And I wasn’t familiar?” Agatha asked quietly.</span></p><p><span>The room went very still.</span></p><p><span>Wanda swallowed. “That’s not what I meant.”</span></p><p><span>“But it’s what you did,” Agatha said. “You ran straight back to the version of yourself that doesn’t have to explain anything. The one that doesn’t make your parents uncomfortable. The one that doesn’t ask you to be brave.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda shook her head, tears spilling freely now. “I never meant to hurt you.”</span></p><p><span>“I know,” Agatha said, voice breaking. “That doesn’t make it hurt less.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda reached for her again, desperation overriding caution. “Agatha, please. I don’t want to lose you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a shaky breath. “Then why do I feel like I already have?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda opened her mouth, then closed it. No words came.</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed again, this time bitter and wet. “You see? This is what I mean. You love me- but not enough to stand up for me. Not enough to say my name out loud.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m trying,” Wanda sobbed. “This is hard for me.”</span></p><p><span>“I know it is,” Agatha snapped, anger flaring again. “But do you have any idea how hard it is for me to sit in a house full of people who don’t even know who I am to you? To watch you hold hands with your ex because it’s easier than holding mine?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda flinched as if struck. “I didn’t hold his hand.”</span></p><p><span>“You cuddled him,” Agatha shot back. “Don’t split hairs.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda looked down, shame etched into every line of her posture. “I was stupid.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes,” Agatha agreed. “You were.”</span></p><p><span>The bluntness made Wanda sob harder.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt the anger drain out of her all at once, leaving behind only exhaustion and grief. Her shoulders sagged. Her eyes burned anew.</span></p><p><span>“I can’t do this,” she said hoarsely. “I can’t keep shrinking myself to fit into your fear.”</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” she whispered.</span></p><p><span>She stood, moving carefully, as if any sudden motion might shatter what little peace remained. She grabbed a sweater, her phone, a pair of boots. She paused at the door, turning back once.</span></p><p><span>“I really do love you,” she said quietly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t answer.</span></p><p><span>Wanda left.</span></p><p><span>The door clicked shut, the sound echoing far too loudly in the small room.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stood there for a long moment, staring at the closed door. Then her knees buckled, and she crawled back into the bed, curling in on herself as the sobs finally broke free.</span></p><p><span>She buried her face in the pillow, breathing in the faint scent of Wanda’s shampoo, hating herself for how much it still comforted her.</span></p><p><span>And beneath the grief, beneath the anger, another thought surfaced- unwelcome and persistent.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s laugh.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hands steadying her on the ice.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s mouth, warm and certain, against hers in the cold night air.</span></p><p><span>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, heart aching with a want she didn’t know what to do with.</span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t remember deciding to get out of bed.</span></p><p><span>She just… found herself moving.</span></p><p><span>Down the stairs, one careful step at a time, the house already alive in that specific, frantic way it only ever was on holidays, too many people, too many expectations, too much noise pretending to be joy.</span></p><p><span>Christmas Eve had arrived like a starting gun.</span></p><p><span>The living room was half-transformed into a battlefield of ribbon spools and ornament boxes. Pine needles dusted the rug like evidence. Somewhere, a radio crackled out a carol that had been cheerful the first fifty times and now felt vaguely threatening.</span></p><p><span>“Pietro, the silver runner does not go on that table- what are you doing?”</span></p><p><span>“I’m improvising!”</span></p><p><span>“Stop improvising.”</span></p><p><span>Iryna’s voice cut clean through the chaos, sharp and commanding, her hair already pinned up, clipboard in hand like she was running a military operation instead of a party. She pivoted mid-stride, issuing instructions without breaking pace.</span></p><p><span>“Olek, the candles. Billy, not like that. Tommy, if you put tinsel on the dog again-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha hovered on the threshold for a second, unnoticed, invisible in the way she had become frighteningly good at. Her chest still felt tight from the morning, from Wanda’s voice, from the way anger and hurt had braided themselves together so tightly she wasn’t sure where one ended and the other began.</span></p><p><span>Coffee.</span><span><br/></span><span>She needed coffee.</span></p><p><span>She made a beeline for the kitchen, slipping past Pietro carrying a box labeled </span><em><span>FRAGILE</span></em><span> that was very clearly not being handled with care.</span></p><p><span>The kitchen was only marginally calmer. Someone had already burned toast. The smell of cinnamon fought with coffee grounds and something savory simmering on the stove. Agatha reached for a mug like it was a life raft.</span></p><p><span>She was halfway through pouring when a voice spoke from behind her.</span></p><p><span>“You two were very loud last night.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze.</span></p><p><span>The coffee sloshed dangerously close to the rim of the mug, a dark wave threatening to spill over. Her shoulders went rigid, every muscle locking into place as she slowly turned her head.</span></p><p><span>Lilia stood by the counter, serene as ever, hands folded, eyes sharp and unreadable. She looked like someone who had just commented on the weather, not dropped a bomb at 8am.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at her. “What?”</span></p><p><span>Lilia shrugged, completely unbothered. “Just an observation.”</span></p><p><span>Heat crept up Agatha’s neck. Her heart began to thud, loud enough she was certain everyone in the room could hear it.</span></p><p><span>“We-” She stopped herself, jaw tightening. “I don’t know what you think you heard.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, I didn’t think anything,” Lilia said mildly. “I simply found it interesting how… heated things can get between roommates.”</span></p><p><span>The word landed with a dull, sickening weight.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s fingers curled tighter around the mug. “We had a disagreement.”</span></p><p><span>“Mmm.” Lilia hummed, tilting her head. “Yes. They tend to sound like that.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed. “It was late. Voices carry.”</span></p><p><span>“Indeed.” Lilia smiled faintly, a smile that somehow managed to feel like a challenge. “Anyway. Just thought I’d mention it.”</span></p><p><span>She turned away, already done with the conversation, drifting back toward the living room like she hadn’t just knocked the breath out of Agatha’s lungs.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stood there, staring after her, pulse racing.</span></p><p><span>Did she know?</span></p><p><span>No. She couldn’t. Lilia was… odd, yes, perceptive in an unsettling way, but that comment, </span><em><span>roommates</span></em><span>, it had been pointed, but not accusatory. Observational. Ambiguous.</span></p><p><span>Still, Agatha’s gaze flicked instinctively toward the doorway.</span></p><p><span>Wanda.</span></p><p><span>She was in the living room, moving through the space with practiced efficiency, handing ornaments to Pietro, nodding along as Iryna barked orders, her face carefully neutral. Composed. Public-Wanda.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s stomach twisted.</span></p><p><span>Should she tell her?</span></p><p><span>The idea alone made her chest ache. The thought of pulling Wanda aside, of reopening anything from last night, even just to say </span><em><span>hey, your nonna might have heard us screaming at each other</span></em><span>, felt like pressing on a bruise she didn’t know how to protect anymore.</span></p><p><span>She looked back down at her coffee, hands trembling just enough to be annoying.</span></p><p><span>Before she could decide, a familiar presence crashed into her personal space.</span></p><p><span>“There you are!”</span></p><p><span>Billy appeared at her elbow, bright-eyed and already vibrating with urgency, holding a roll of garland like it was a sacred object. “I’ve been looking everywhere for you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. “That’s concerning.”</span></p><p><span>“I need help,” he declared. “Grandma put me in charge of the staircase decorations, which is insane, because clearly I’m the least festive person here.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Bold claim.”</span></p><p><span>He scoffed. “Tommy glued a candy cane to the banister. Sideways.”</span></p><p><span>“That does sound criminal.”</span></p><p><span>Billy grinned. “Right? So you’ll help me. You have… opinions.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted despite herself. “I do have opinions.”</span></p><p><span>“And you’re tall,” he added helpfully.</span></p><p><span>She sighed, taking a long sip of coffee like she was fortifying herself. “Fine. But if I get tangled in tinsel and die, this is on you.”</span></p><p><span>“Worth it,” Billy said immediately, already tugging her toward the living room. “Come on.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let herself be pulled along, casting one last glance toward Wanda.</span></p><p><span>Wanda didn’t look back.</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned away, following Billy toward the staircase, her shoulders tense, her thoughts loud.</span></p><p><span>Whatever Lilia knew, or thought she knew, would have to wait.</span></p><p><span>Right now, there were garlands to hang.</span></p><p><span>And a very long day ahead of her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha spent the better part of the morning becoming an accomplice.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t think much of it once she finished voicing her opinion on the stairs that looked like elves had thrown up on.</span></p><p><span>It started innocently enough, Billy cornering her near the stairs with a clipboard that looked suspiciously official, Tommy flanking him like backup muscle.</span></p><p><span>“We need help,” Tommy announced.</span></p><p><span>Agatha eyed the clipboard. “With what crime?”</span></p><p><span>“Decor,” Billy said. “Grandma’s on a rampage.”</span></p><p><span>As if summoned by her name, Iryna’s voice rang out from the living room. “Why are the napkins not folded yet? Olek, those are the </span><em><span>linen</span></em><span> ones- no, not like that- Pietro, stop rearranging the chairs, I already measured-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha winced. “Ah. I see. You’re seeking asylum.”</span></p><p><span>Billy grinned. “Exactly.”</span></p><p><span>She followed them toward the dining room, where half the Christmas Eve setup was already in motion. Garlands half-hung. Place cards stacked like tiny paper soldiers. A folding table groaning under the weight of serving platters that hadn’t yet earned their contents.</span></p><p><span>Agatha immediately clocked Wanda on the far side of the room, perched on a step stool and stringing lights along the banister with forced cheer. Their eyes did not meet.</span></p><p><span>Good, Agatha thought. Fine. Perfect, even.</span></p><p><span>She turned her attention back to the boys. “What’s my assignment?”</span></p><p><span>Tommy consulted the clipboard with exaggerated seriousness. “We’ve been put in charge of assembling the gingerbread village.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s mouth twitched. “Village. Not house?”</span></p><p><span>Billy nodded gravely. “Grandma said if one more thing collapses, she’s canceling Christmas.”</span></p><p><span>“That tracks.”</span></p><p><span>They relocated to the kitchen table, where a chaotic spread of gingerbread panels, frosting bags, candy bowls, and instruction sheets awaited them. Agatha took one look and sighed.</span></p><p><span>“I want it on record,” she said, rolling up the sleeves of her sweater, “that I am only doing this because I respect structural integrity.”</span></p><p><span>Billy beamed. “I knew you were an engineer at heart.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m a professor,” Agatha corrected. “There’s a difference.”</span></p><p><span>“Debatable,” Tommy said, already biting the head off a gumdrop.</span></p><p><span>Agatha smacked his hand lightly. “Do not eat the load-bearing candy.”</span></p><p><span>“Wow,” Billy murmured. “She </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> intense.”</span></p><p><span>Despite herself, Agatha found the rhythm of it soothing. Frosting squeezed carefully along edges. Walls pressed together and held until they set. Billy read instructions aloud with the earnestness of someone narrating a NASA launch, while Tommy provided running commentary that consisted mostly of sarcastic asides and stolen candy.</span></p><p><span>At some point, Iryna stormed past, paused, and narrowed her eyes at the table.</span></p><p><span>“Why is that roof crooked?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t look up. “Because gravity exists.”</span></p><p><span>A beat.</span></p><p><span>Then Iryna sniffed and moved on.</span></p><p><span>Billy stared at Agatha like she’d just performed a magic trick. “How did you do that?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha allowed herself a small, smug smile. “Years of dealing with hostile administrators.”</span></p><p><span>They worked like that for hours, ducking into side rooms when Iryna’s voice got too sharp, trading jokes under their breath, bonding over a shared desire to avoid becoming collateral damage in the quest for the “Perfect Christmas.”</span></p><p><span>They carried boxes together. Hung ornaments in less conspicuous corners. Argued about whether a gingerbread church was blasphemous or just festive.</span></p><p><span>At one point, as they crouched behind the couch pretending to “sort extension cords,” Tommy nudged her knee.</span></p><p><span>“So,” he said casually. “You and Aunt Wanda, huh?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stiffened. Just slightly. “What about us?”</span></p><p><span>Billy shot his brother a look. “Tommy.”</span></p><p><span>“What?” Tommy shrugged. “I’m just saying, you two are… loud.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted despite herself. “So I’ve been told.”</span></p><p><span>Billy leaned back against the couch. “You don’t have to answer, but-” He hesitated, then shrugged. “We like you.”</span></p><p><span>Something in Agatha’s chest gave a small, unexpected tug.</span></p><p><span>“Well,” she said lightly, “your judgment is questionable, but appreciated.”</span></p><p><span>They broke for lunch, something hastily assembled and eaten standing up in the kitchen while Iryna paced and muttered to herself about seating charts. Agatha barely tasted it, but she welcomed the brief pause, the way the boys joked and bickered like it was just another day and not a carefully balanced emotional minefield.</span></p><p><span>Afterward, as the afternoon light shifted and the house settled into that pre-party hum, Agatha felt the weight of the evening creeping closer.</span></p><p><span>She wiped her hands on a dish towel. “Alright,” she said. “I’m going to go get ready before your grandmother decides my presence is a liability.”</span></p><p><span>Billy saluted. “Godspeed.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy grinned. “Try not to get exiled.”</span></p><p><span>“No promises.”</span></p><p><span>She escaped upstairs, closing the bedroom door behind her with a soft click. The quiet hit her all at once.</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned back against the door for a moment, breathing. Letting the noise downstairs fade into a distant murmur. Only then did she move, crossing to the mirror, taking in the reflection she’d been avoiding.</span></p><p><span>Her eyes were still tired. Shadows lingered beneath them. But the sharpness was there, too. The resolve.</span></p><p><span>She straightened, rolled her shoulders, and reached for the dress she’d laid out earlier.</span></p><p><span>Whatever tonight brought, she would face it standing.</span></p><p><span>Agatha shut the door to the guest bathroom with more care than necessary, easing it closed until the latch caught with a soft click. The house hummed beyond it, voices, footsteps, the low clatter of preparation, but in here there was a pocket of quiet she could pretend belonged only to her.</span></p><p><span>She turned on the light and stared at her reflection.</span></p><p><span>She looked… fine. Composed. Put together in a way that suggested control, not the emotional wreckage of the past forty-eight hours. Her hair was still pinned up in sections, heat curling iron warming on the counter. Her makeup bag lay open like a confession. If she tilted her head just right, she could almost believe she’d slept through the night without crying herself into a headache.</span></p><p><span>She exhaled through her nose.</span></p><p><span>Wanda.</span></p><p><span>The thought arrived fully formed, heavy and unavoidable. It carried everything with it- the fight, the shouting, the way Wanda’s face had crumpled, the sound of her own voice when it finally broke. The way Wanda had gathered her things without argument. The way the door had clicked shut behind her, leaving Agatha alone in a bed that suddenly felt too small.</span></p><p><span>Agatha picked up the curling iron, wrapped a section of hair around it, and focused on the hiss of heat instead.</span></p><p><span>She understood Wanda’s fear. She always had. She understood the weight of a family that loved you conditionally, of a town that remembered every version of you and expected you to keep playing the part they liked best. She understood the instinct to minimize yourself to survive.</span></p><p><span>What she didn’t understand, what she couldn’t swallow, was being erased.</span></p><p><span>Being called a roommate. Being left alone at parties. Being watched while the person you loved curled up with someone else and laughed like nothing was wrong.</span></p><p><span>She released the curl and watched it fall into place.</span></p><p><span>And then there was Rio.</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed.</span></p><p><span>She hadn’t meant for that to happen. Hadn’t meant for a day of ice skating and cider and weird sandwiches to slip under her skin like that. Hadn’t meant to laugh so easily, to feel so seen. Hadn’t meant to stand outside a bar in the cold and let herself be kissed.</span></p><p><span>But she had.</span></p><p><span>And the worst part, the part that made her chest ache in a way she didn’t want to interrogate too closely, was how natural it had felt. How unafraid.</span></p><p><span>Agatha set the curling iron down and braced her hands on the counter, head bowed.</span></p><p><span>Get it together, Harkness.</span></p><p><span>She straightened, finished her hair with steady hands, pinned the last curl in place. She changed into her outfit carefully, smoothing fabric, checking seams. This wasn’t the night for armor exactly, but it was close.</span></p><p><span>When she reached for her phone, it buzzed in her hand.</span></p><p><span>Her stomach dropped before she even saw the name.</span></p><p><b>Rio:</b><b><br/></b><span>Heard there’s a certain Maximoff Christmas Eve spectacle tonight</span><span><br/></span><span>I assume it’s… intense?</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at the screen longer than necessary, then huffed a quiet laugh despite herself.</span></p><p><b>Agatha:</b><b><br/></b><span>That’s one word for it.</span><span><br/></span><span>Think tasteful chaos meets military operation.</span></p><p><span>The reply came almost immediately.</span></p><p><b>Rio:</b><b><br/></b><span>I knew it.</span><span><br/></span><span>I’ve been emotionally preparing all day.</span></p><p><span>Agatha smiled, small, real. She leaned back against the counter, thumb hovering.</span></p><p><b>Agatha:</b><b><br/></b><span>You’ll survive. You’re very brave.</span><span><br/></span><span>And there will be wine.</span></p><p><span>A pause. Then-</span></p><p><b>Rio:</b><b><br/></b><span>Temptress.</span><span><br/></span><span>Are you… okay?</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s fingers stilled.</span></p><p><span>She could lie. She was very good at that.</span></p><p><span>Instead, she typed:</span></p><p><b>Agatha:</b><b><br/></b><span>I will be.</span><span><br/></span><span>I’m actually… looking forward to seeing you.</span></p><p><span>The three dots appeared. Disappeared. Appeared again.</span></p><p><b>Rio:</b><b><br/></b><span>Good.</span><span><br/></span><span>Because I am too. Maybe an unreasonable amount.</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed her eyes briefly, resting her head back against the cool tile.</span></p><p><b>Agatha:</b><b><br/></b><span>See you downstairs, then.</span></p><p><b>Rio:</b><b><br/></b><span>I’ll be the one pretending not to judge the ornament choices.</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted softly and slipped her phone back into her pocket before she could overthink it.</span></p><p><span>She took one last look in the mirror. The woman staring back looked composed, sharp-eyed, a little tired, but steadier than she’d felt all morning. She squared her shoulders.</span></p><p><span>Time to re-enter the performance.</span></p><p><span>The hallway was louder now, voices overlapping, music drifting up from downstairs. Agatha moved through it carefully, aware of every creak of the floor, every burst of laughter that made her chest tighten reflexively. She passed Wanda’s room without looking at the door.</span></p><p><span>Down the stairs, into warmth and light and the hum of expectation.</span></p><p><span>The living room had transformed into something out of a magazine spread, trees glowing, garlands arranged with surgical precision, guests beginning to filter in already. Iryna swept past with a tray, barking instructions. Olek stood near the fireplace, holding court. Billy and Tommy darted through with barely contained energy, stopping to grin at Agatha like co-conspirators before being shooed away again.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stepped fully into the room, letting the noise wash over her.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t look for Wanda.</span></p><p><span>Not yet.</span></p><p><span>Instead, she reached instinctively for the familiar anchor of a glass being pressed into her hand by someone she didn’t know, offered a polite smile, made a few vague comments about the weather. She laughed when expected to laugh. She nodded when expected to nod.</span></p><p><span>She took a breath, squared herself once more, and stepped fully into Maximoff party perfection.</span></p>

<p><span>She smoothed a hand down the front of her dress more out of nerves than necessity.</span></p><p><span>Okay, she told herself. One drink. Then another. Then survive.</span></p><p><span>Her eyes scanned instinctively for Wanda, and found her immediately, of course. Wanda stood near her parents, posture perfect, smile fixed in place as she laughed at something Olek said. She looked… composed. Radiant, even. Like nothing had shattered between them less than twenty-four hours ago.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s chest tightened.</span></p><p><span>She broke her gaze and turned instead toward her immediate objective: the makeshift bar Pietro had apparently set up in the living room, complete with a borrowed cocktail shaker and a handwritten menu that promised things like </span><em><span>Holiday Mule</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>Iryna’s Famous Punch</span></em><span>, which sounded like a threat.</span></p><p><span>She made it exactly three steps before a familiar voice cut in.</span></p><p><span>“Whoa, okay, pause.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stopped.</span></p><p><span>Billy appeared at her elbow, dressed in a button-down that still had the faintest crease from being yanked out of a closet. Tommy hovered just behind him, grinning like he knew something he shouldn’t.</span></p><p><span>“Are you-” Billy gestured at her vaguely, “-done up?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. “I’m… dressed appropriately for a party, yes. Thank you for your concern.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy leaned in. “You look fancy.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s not a compliment,” Agatha said flatly.</span></p><p><span>Billy scoffed. “It absolutely is. He means you look intimidating.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha arched a brow. “Now </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> I’ll accept.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy crossed his arms. “You heading for the bar?”</span></p><p><span>“I am,” Agatha said. “And unless either of you are about to stop me for a very good reason, I suggest you move.”</span></p><p><span>Billy’s grin widened. “Just checking. Because if you </span><em><span>are</span></em><span> going for a drink, Pietro said you’re not allowed to touch the punch.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha paused. “Why.”</span></p><p><span>“Because last year Uncle Yuri tried it and cried,” Tommy said cheerfully.</span></p><p><span>“Noted,” Agatha replied. “Now move.”</span></p><p><span>They parted dramatically, like stagehands clearing a path, and Agatha stepped through them with a long-suffering sigh.</span></p><p><span>She reached the bar at last, exhaled softly, and leaned one elbow against the counter. The bartender, one of Wanda’s cousins, she thought, turned with a polite smile.</span></p><p><span>“Hi! What can I get you?”</span></p><p><span>“Something strong,” Agatha said. “And if it can erase the last forty-eight hours, even better.”</span></p><p><span>The cousin laughed nervously. “Uh- vodka cranberry?”</span></p><p><span>“Perfect.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha watched the drink being poured, letting the noise of the room wash over her. She felt oddly untethered, present, but slightly removed, like she was observing everything from just behind her own eyes.</span></p><p><span>Then, softly, from just to her left:</span></p><p><span>“Hey.”</span></p><p><span>The word barely carried over the hum of the room, but it landed like a struck chord.</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned.</span></p><p><span>Rio stood there, close enough that Agatha could smell her, something clean and warm and unmistakably </span><em><span>her</span></em><span>. She wore a deep green dress that hugged her shoulders and fell in an easy, elegant line, hair loose and curling just enough to look effortless. One hand rested on the bar, fingers relaxed, like she belonged exactly where she was.</span></p><p><span>For a moment, Agatha forgot how to breathe.</span></p><p><span>“Oh,” she managed, intelligently.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s smile was small but unmistakably real. “Hi.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s pulse skidded. She took the drink the bartender slid toward her without looking, fingers tightening around the glass like it was an anchor.</span></p><p><span>“Hi,” she echoed, softer now.</span></p><p><span>They stood there, facing each other, the party continuing around them completely oblivious. Agatha became acutely aware of everything at once, the warmth of the room, the buzz of voices, the weight of last night’s kiss still lingering like a ghost on her lips.</span></p><p><span>Rio tilted her head, eyes flicking over Agatha in a way that made her skin prickle. “You look… wow.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha huffed, the sound almost a laugh. “You don’t get to say that. That’s unfair.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s grin widened. “I do. I absolutely do.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head, a reluctant smile tugging at her mouth despite herself. “You look… devastating.”</span></p><p><span>“I’ll take that,” Rio said lightly.</span></p><p><span>Their eyes held for a beat too long.</span></p><p><span>Somewhere across the room, someone laughed loudly. A glass clinked. The music shifted.</span></p><p><span>But for Agatha, the world narrowed to the woman in front of her, and the quiet, terrifying realization that no matter how much she tried to brace herself…</span></p><p><span>Seeing Rio like this still knocked the air right out of her lungs.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s smile faltered.</span></p><p><span>It was subtle, something that would’ve gone unnoticed by almost anyone else, but Agatha saw it the moment Rio really looked at her. Not the dress, not the room, not the chaos humming around them. Her eyes went straight to Agatha’s face.</span></p><p><span>To the faint redness around her eyes.</span><span><br/></span><span>To the way her lashes still clumped slightly, like tears hadn’t been fully washed away.</span><span><br/></span><span>To the tired heaviness Agatha hadn’t quite managed to school out of herself.</span></p><p><span>“Oh,” Rio said quietly.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t an accusation. It wasn’t even a question. It was just…concern.</span></p><p><span>Her body shifted instinctively closer, shoulder angling in, voice lowering to carve out a pocket of privacy in the noise. “Hey,” she murmured. “What happened?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha opened her mouth, and closed it again.</span></p><p><span>Because there were too many answers. Because none of them fit in a room full of holiday music and clinking glasses and Wanda Maximoff’s family pretending everything was perfect.</span></p><p><span>Rio waited. She always did.</span></p><p><span>Then something flickered across her face, uncertainty, followed by a quick flash of panic she clearly tried to swallow.</span></p><p><span>“Is-” Rio hesitated, words tripping over themselves for once. “Is this because of last night? Because if I- if that was too much, or bad timing, or-”</span></p><p><span>Her voice dropped even lower. “Agatha, if I hurt you-”</span></p><p><span>“No.” The word came out sharper than Agatha intended.</span></p><p><span>Rio froze.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s chest tightened at the way Rio immediately pulled back half an inch, guilt already settling in her expression like it belonged there. Like she was bracing herself to take responsibility for something she hadn’t caused.</span></p><p><span>And that, that did it.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stood so abruptly her chair scraped softly against the floor. She reached out, fingers curling around Rio’s wrist before Rio could retreat any further.</span></p><p><span>“Come here,” Agatha said, not unkindly, but firm. Decisive.</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked. “What-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t explain. She just tugged gently, guiding her away from the bar, away from the living room, away from the hum of voices and expectations and the thousand eyes that never quite looked at Agatha anyway.</span></p><p><span>They slipped into the dining room, mercifully empty, lit only by soft string lights and the warm glow of the chandelier. The long table had been transformed into a painstakingly detailed gingerbread village, little frosted rooftops, powdered-sugar snow, gumdrop pathways.</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed the door behind them.</span></p><p><span>The noise from the party dulled instantly.</span></p><p><span>Only then did she let go of Rio’s wrist.</span></p><p><span>Only then did she exhale.</span></p><p><span>Rio watched her carefully, eyes searching, all that earlier playfulness gone, replaced by something steadier, softer, painfully earnest.</span></p><p><span>Agatha met her gaze, jaw tight but eyes honest.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t do that,” Agatha said quietly.</span></p><p><span>“Do what?”</span></p><p><span>“Assume this-” She gestured vaguely between them, the word kiss hanging unspoken in the air. “-was the thing that hurt me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked past her for half a second, at the gingerbread houses, at the tiny sugar windows glowing under the lights, and then back at Rio.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hands fluttered uselessly at her sides, words tripping over each other as soon as Agatha’s attention was fully on her.</span></p><p><span>“I’m- God, Agatha, I’m so sorry,” she rushed, voice low but frantic. “I shouldn’t have done that, I shouldn’t have kissed you, I don’t know what I was thinking, I just-” She laughed once, sharp and self-directed. “You looked sad and I thought maybe it was because of me and I swear that was never my intention, I would never want to be another thing that hurts you, especially not after-”</span></p><p><span>“Rio,” Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>Rio barely paused. “I crossed a line. You didn’t ask for that, and you’re in this situation already and I completely get if you want to pretend it never happened, I can do that, I’m very good at pretending-”</span></p><p><span>“Rio.”</span></p><p><span>Still she kept going, hands finally coming up to rake through her hair. “I should’ve asked. Or not said anything. Or just- God, I don’t know, stayed in my lane like a normal adult instead of acting like some-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stepped closer.</span></p><p><span>The gingerbread village sat frozen on the table beside them, tiny sugar-glass windows glowing softly, candy canes leaning at imperfect angles, a dusting of powdered sugar like snow. The muffled hum of the party bled faintly through the walls, laughter and music and the clink of glasses, but here it was just the two of them and Rio’s spiraling breath.</span></p><p><span>“I’m really sorry,” Rio added, quieter now, eyes finally lifting to Agatha’s. “If I hurt you-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t let her finish.</span></p><p><span>She reached up, cupped Rio’s jaw, and kissed her.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t careful. It wasn’t hesitant. It was quick and firm and unmistakably intentional, lips pressing into Rio’s just long enough to steal the air from her lungs and the words from her mouth.</span></p><p><span>Rio froze.</span></p><p><span>Then she melted, hands hovering inches away from Agatha’s waist, breath catching in a soft, surprised sound.</span></p><p><span>“Oh-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha pulled back first.</span></p><p><span>Rio froze like she’d been unplugged, breath caught halfway in, hands still hovering at Agatha’s waist like she wasn’t sure if she was allowed to keep touching her.</span></p><p><span>“Now,” Agatha said, voice hoarse but steadying, “if you’re done spiraling…”</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked. Once. Twice.</span></p><p><span>Agatha huffed a weak, humorless breath. “I would very much like to tell you why you are not the one who made me cry.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s shoulders sagged in visible relief, but worry still clung to her expression. “Okay,” she said carefully. “I’m listening.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned back against the edge of the dining table, the gingerbread village looming beside them.</span></p><p><span>“I had a fight with Wanda,” she said.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw tightened, not in anger, but in recognition. “Tonight?”</span></p><p><span>“Last night,” Agatha corrected. “After I got back.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stayed quiet. She was good at that, Agatha was learning. Good at giving space without disappearing.</span></p><p><span>“She was drunk,” Agatha continued. “Crying. Saying she loved me. Saying she was terrified of losing me.” Her mouth twisted. “And then she told me she kissed Vision.”</span></p><p><span>Rio inhaled sharply, a soft sound that still felt too loud in the quiet room.</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded, eyes fixed somewhere over Rio’s shoulder. “Yeah. That was about how it felt.”</span></p><p><span>“She-” Rio stopped herself, recalibrated. “She told you?”</span></p><p><span>“She cried it at me,” Agatha said bitterly. “Like that somehow made it… better. Like honesty after the fact was supposed to soften it.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped closer without thinking. Her hand brushed Agatha’s sleeve, tentative. “Agatha…”</span></p><p><span>“I yelled,” Agatha said, voice cracking. “I yelled so loud I thought the house would wake up. I told her everything. Every stupid, small thing I swallowed all week. Every time she let me stand alone. Every time she chose her parents’ comfort over my dignity.” Her laugh broke apart halfway through. “And then I cried. Like- really cried. The kind where you can’t breathe.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hand curled into Agatha’s sleeve now, grounding, real.</span></p><p><span>“She slept on the couch,” Agatha whispered. “I told her I wasn’t doing it again. And she just… nodded. Like I’d confirmed something she already knew.”</span></p><p><span>Her eyes burned, tears gathering faster now, spilling before she could stop them. She laughed weakly, swiping at her face. “And the worst part? I keep wondering if I pushed her into it. If I was too much. Too out. Too-” Her voice caught. “Too unwilling to disappear.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shook her head immediately. “No.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s breath stuttered. “I keep thinking if I’d just been more patient-”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Rio said again, firmer this time.</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked up at her, eyes red, raw. “I love her,” she said helplessly. “Or- I thought I did. And now I don’t even know what that means.”</span></p><p><span>Rio lifted both hands, gently cupping Agatha’s face without hesitation now. Her thumbs brushed away tears like it was instinct. “Agatha,” she said softly, “someone loving you does not mean you have to make yourself smaller to keep them.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a broken sound that might have been a sob, might have been a laugh.</span></p><p><span>“And then,” Agatha rushed on, panic spiking, words tumbling over each other, “there’s us. And the kiss. And now I’m standing here telling you this like I didn’t just do the exact thing I screamed at her for. Like I’m not a hypocrite.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s brow furrowed. “That’s not the same.”</span></p><p><span>“It feels the same,” Agatha said desperately. “I kissed you. While I’m still- while she’s still-” She sucked in a sharp breath. “What does that say about me?”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t answer right away. Instead, she pulled Agatha forward, wrapping her arms around her fully this time, firm and grounding. Agatha resisted for half a second out of pure habit, then collapsed into it, forehead pressing into Rio’s shoulder.</span></p><p><span>“I don’t know how to fix this,” Agatha whispered into the fabric of Rio’s dress. “I don’t know how to be the good person here.”</span></p><p><span>Rio rested her chin against Agatha’s temple. “You don’t have to fix anything tonight.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head, tears soaking through. “I kissed you. I don’t get to pretend that doesn’t mean something.”</span></p><p><span>“It does mean something,” Rio said quietly. “But it doesn’t make you bad.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha pulled back just enough to look at her. “What if I can’t do this again?” she asked, fear naked in her voice. “What if I can’t be with someone who isn’t out? Who’s ashamed? What if that makes me selfish?”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes softened, something fierce and gentle living there at the same time. “It makes you honest.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s lips trembled. “I fought so hard for myself,” she whispered. “For who I am. And being here- it feels like I’m fourteen again, hiding pieces of myself so I don’t get hurt.”</span></p><p><span>Rio brushed her thumb under Agatha’s eye. “Then you get to choose not to do that anymore.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed. “Even if it costs me someone I love?”</span></p><p><span>Rio held her gaze, unwavering. “Especially then.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed her eyes, pressing her forehead against Rio’s. She let herself breathe. Let herself be held. Let herself not have an answer yet.</span></p><p><span>And for the first time all week, she didn’t feel like she was standing alone in the middle of someone else’s perfect holiday.</span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>By the time Agatha and Rio drifted back into the living room, the party had reached that particular holiday pitch where the music was just loud enough to blur conversations and the air smelled like cinnamon, citrus peel, and too many bodies packed into a space meant for half of them.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes still burned, her chest sore in that hollowed-out way crying left behind, but she felt… steadier. Like Rio had helped her set something down she’d been carrying clenched in her teeth.</span></p><p><span>Rio walked beside her without touching her, close enough that Agatha could feel her warmth through the thin space between their coats. It was deliberate, Agatha realized, an offering without pressure. You lead. I’m here.</span></p><p><span>They stepped fully into the living room, and almost immediately-</span></p><p><span>“Agatha!”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s voice cut through the noise. Agatha turned just in time to see her threading through a cluster of people, dress immaculate, smile tight around the edges. Her eyes flicked once, twice, over Agatha’s face, and something anxious sparked there.</span></p><p><span>“Where did you two run off to?” Wanda asked, breathless, trying for casual and missing by a mile.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t even hesitate. “Bathroom line,” she said smoothly. “Apparently everyone in Westview drinks like they’re preparing for hibernation.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda let out a small laugh that didn’t reach her eyes. She looked closer at Agatha then, really looked, and her expression shifted.</span></p><p><span>“Are you-” Wanda started, lowering her voice. “You look like you were-”</span></p><p><span>“I’m fine,” Agatha cut in, sharper than she meant to be but unable to soften it in time. “Just warm. Overcrowded.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda opened her mouth again, clearly gearing up for an apology or a question or something heavier, but before she could get a word out, Iryna’s voice rang out from across the room.</span></p><p><span>“Wanda! Come help me with the desserts, now, please.”</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t a request.</span></p><p><span>Wanda winced, eyes flicking between her mother and Agatha. “I- just a second,” she said, but Iryna was already bearing down on her like a general spotting a wayward soldier.</span></p><p><span>“Now,” Iryna repeated, smile pleasant and unyielding.</span></p><p><span>Wanda shot Agatha one last look, apologetic, helpless, and then she was gone, swallowed by obligation.</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled slowly through her nose.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned in just enough to murmur, “You okay?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded. “I am now.”</span></p><p><span>Rio studied her for a beat, then tipped her head toward the makeshift bar set up near the far wall. “Drink?”</span></p><p><span>“God, yes.”</span></p><p><span>They made their way over together, Rio snagging two glasses of mulled wine from the bar with practiced ease. She handed one to Agatha, their fingers brushing briefly, just enough to send a quiet awareness skittering up Agatha’s arm.</span></p><p><span>They retreated to a corner of the living room near the tree, half-hidden by garlands and a strategically placed bookshelf. It felt like a pocket of calm carved out of chaos.</span></p><p><span>Agatha took a sip and closed her eyes for half a second. “That might be the best thing I’ve tasted all day.”</span></p><p><span>Rio grinned. “High praise.”</span></p><p><span>They settled side by side, shoulders almost touching. Agatha could feel the hum of Rio’s presence again, that same grounding pull from the scavenger hunt, from the bar, from the balcony. It was unsettling how quickly her body seemed to recognize it.</span></p><p><span>They hadn’t been there more than a minute when-</span></p><p><span>“There you are!”</span></p><p><span>Billy’s voice announced itself before the rest of him did. He and Tommy appeared out of nowhere, like summoned spirits fueled entirely by sugar and chaos.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Billy said, eyes bright, words tumbling over each other. “Okay so you have to tell me if this is a bad idea or a really bad idea because I genuinely can’t tell anymore.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy snorted. “It’s definitely a bad idea.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha raised a brow. “You’re going to need to narrow that down. This family has a wide definition of ‘bad.’”</span></p><p><span>Billy rocked back on his heels, lowering his voice despite the noise around them. “There’s this guy. In the other room. Dark hair, stupid jawline, wearing a sweater that definitely cost more than my car.”</span></p><p><span>Rio made a soft, appreciative noise. “Bold sweater choice. I respect it.”</span></p><p><span>Billy nodded vigorously. “Right? And he’s been looking at me. Like- looking at me looking. And I think he’s gay? Or at least… something.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stilled, wine glass hovering halfway to her mouth.</span></p><p><span>She looked at Billy properly then, really looked. The nervous energy, the way he kept glancing toward the hallway, the careful casualness layered over hope. Recognition clicked into place with startling clarity.</span></p><p><span>“Oh,” she said quietly.</span></p><p><span>Billy’s eyes flicked to hers, something cautious there. “Oh… what?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha lowered her glass. “Nothing bad. Just-” She hesitated, then softened her voice. “You’re not subtle.”</span></p><p><span>Tommy blinked. “Wait, what are we talking about?”</span></p><p><span>Billy elbowed him. “Go bother someone else.”</span></p><p><span>“Rude,” Tommy said, but he wandered off anyway, already distracted by a plate of cookies.</span></p><p><span>Billy shifted his weight, suddenly unsure. “I just- everyone here is so…” He gestured vaguely toward the room. “Westview.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt something warm and unexpected bloom in her chest. Trust. That’s what this was. Billy had clocked her, somehow, instinctively, and chosen her anyway.</span></p><p><span>She met his gaze steadily. “You don’t owe anyone here anything,” she said. “Not explanations. Not performances. Not fear.”</span></p><p><span>Billy swallowed. “So you think I should…?”</span></p><p><span>Before Agatha could answer, Rio leaned in, voice gentle and bright. “You should do whatever feels safest and truest for you,” she said. “And if that means a five-minute conversation by the snack table, that’s a great start.”</span></p><p><span>Billy glanced between them. “You’re really good at this.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled. “I’ve had practice.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha watched the exchange, watched the ease with which Rio made space for him, didn’t rush, didn’t interrogate. Just… offered steadiness. The same steadiness she’d given Agatha all day.</span></p><p><span>Billy nodded slowly. “Okay. Okay. I can do five minutes.”</span></p><p><span>“You’ve got this,” Agatha said. “And if it goes terribly, you can come back and we’ll verbally eviscerate his sweater.”</span></p><p><span>Billy laughed, shoulders loosening. “Deal.”</span></p><p><span>He hesitated, then added quietly, “Thanks. Both of you.”</span></p><p><span>As he disappeared into the crowd, Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding.</span></p><p><span>Rio glanced at her. “You clocked that too, huh?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded. “Immediately.”</span></p><p><span>“He trusts you,” Rio said softly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s throat tightened. “I know.”</span></p><p><span>They stood there for a moment, the noise of the party washing around them. Agatha took another sip of wine, letting the warmth settle in her chest.</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t expect…” She trailed off.</span></p><p><span>Rio tilted her head. “Didn’t expect what?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha considered the room, the tree, the lights, the laughter, the sharp edges softened just enough to be bearable. Thought about the mall, the gala, the bar, the kiss.</span></p><p><span>“…to find this much peace here,” she finished honestly.</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled, small and knowing. “Sometimes it sneaks up on you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha glanced at her, something unspoken lingering between them, fragile, real, unnamed.</span></p><p><span>For the first time since arriving in Westview, Agatha didn’t feel entirely out of place.</span></p><p><span>Agatha had almost convinced herself she could enjoy this.</span></p><p><span>She stood tucked into the far corner of the living room with Rio. The noise of the party blurred into something manageable here, laughter dulled by distance, the clink of glasses softened, music reduced to a pleasant hum instead of an assault.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned close, shoulder brushing Agatha’s, laughing quietly at something Billy had said a moment earlier before being dragged away by Tommy. Her smile was easy, her presence grounding. Every time Agatha’s thoughts threatened to spiral outward again, toward Wanda, toward the fight, toward the kiss that shouldn’t have happened, Rio anchored her back with a look or a touch or a low comment that made her huff a reluctant laugh.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t perfect.</span></p><p><span>But it was… peaceful.</span></p><p><span>Agatha lifted her wine glass, took a careful sip, and let herself breathe.</span></p><p><span>Rio tilted her head, studying her. “You’re doing that thing again.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha glanced sideways. “What thing.”</span></p><p><span>“Where you look like you’re bracing for impact.” Rio smiled softly to take the edge off the observation. “Like the floor might drop out from under you at any second.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled through her nose. “Old habit.”</span></p><p><span>Rio hummed, not pushing. She clinked her glass gently against Agatha’s. “For what it’s worth, you’re allowed to have a good night. Even here.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted quietly. “Bold claim.”</span></p><p><span>But she didn’t disagree.</span></p><p><span>They stood like that for another moment, the warmth of Rio’s arm close enough to feel without touching, the room almost, almost fading into the background.</span></p><p><span>And then Agatha went still.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t dramatic. No sharp inhale, no gasp. Just a sudden, complete halt, like every muscle in her body had locked at once.</span></p><p><span>Rio noticed immediately.</span></p><p><span>She followed Agatha’s gaze across the room, her expression shifting from curious to wary as her eyes landed on the bar.</span></p><p><span>Wanda stood there, a glass in her hand she hadn’t lifted in several minutes. Vision stood too close, close enough that his shoulder brushed her arm, close enough that his hand hovered near the small of her back without quite touching.</span></p><p><span>They were laughing.</span></p><p><span>Not loudly. Not openly. But in that quiet, intimate way that spoke of shared history, of comfort, of familiarity earned over years.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt like she was watching it through water.</span></p><p><span>The room seemed to stretch, sound warping and fading until all she could hear was the rush of blood in her ears. The Christmas music dulled into something distant and unreal. The lights blurred at the edges.</span></p><p><span>Vision leaned in.</span></p><p><span>It happened slowly, agonizingly so. His head dipped toward Wanda’s, his mouth close enough that Agatha could see the intent in the angle of his jaw, the confidence of someone who believed he was welcome there.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s fingers tightened around her wine glass.</span></p><p><span>Rio noticed the tension immediately. She reached out, placing her hand gently over Agatha’s wrist, her voice low and steady. “Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>The glass creaked faintly under the pressure.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s thumb pressed softly against Agatha’s pulse point, grounding, calming. “Hey. Breathe. You’re okay.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha barely registered the words.</span></p><p><span>Wanda hesitated.</span></p><p><span>For a fraction of a second, so small it could have been missed, she froze. Then, at the last possible moment, she turned her head.</span></p><p><span>Vision’s lips brushed her cheek instead.</span></p><p><span>It was chaste. Innocent-looking. Something no one across the room would question or clock or whisper about later.</span></p><p><span>But Agatha felt it like a blow.</span></p><p><span>The world went utterly silent.</span></p><p><span>Her grip tightened further, knuckles whitening, the stem of the glass trembling. Rio’s eyes flicked down in alarm.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” she whispered again, firmer now. “You’re hurting yourself.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t answer.</span></p><p><span>Her gaze stayed locked on Wanda, who was smiling now, too quickly, too brightly, already saying something to Vision that made him laugh as if nothing significant had almost happened at all.</span></p><p><span>As if Agatha hadn’t just watched the ghost of a kiss haunt the space between them.</span></p><p><span>Rio moved closer, her other hand coming up instinctively, trying to steady Agatha’s arm. “Agatha, look at me.”</span></p><p><span>But Agatha was already pulling away.</span></p><p><span>Not violently. Not dramatically.</span></p><p><span>Just slipping.</span></p><p><span>She eased her wrist free from Rio’s grasp, setting the wine glass down on the table beside her with careful precision, too careful, like she didn’t trust herself not to shatter it.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s breath caught. “Agatha-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t look back.</span></p><p><span>She turned and melted into the crowd, shoulders squared, face carefully neutral, disappearing into the noise and light and movement of the party as if she’d never been standing there at all.</span></p><p><span>Rio stayed frozen in place, her hand hovering in the air where Agatha’s wrist had been only seconds before, her chest tight as she watched her go, already knowing this wasn’t over, already fearing how much it was about to hurt.</span></p><p><span>And across the room, Wanda laughed again, oblivious.</span></p>

<p><span>Agatha didn’t think.</span></p><p><span>That was the only way she could explain it later, how her feet started moving before her brain caught up, how the sound in the room rushed back all at once and yet somehow still felt distant, muffled, like she was underwater.</span></p><p><span>She crossed the living room in a straight line.</span></p><p><span>People laughed. Music played. Someone clinked a glass for attention. None of it mattered.</span></p><p><span>Wanda was still at the bar, angled too close to Vision, her hand resting on the edge of the counter, her body turned just enough toward him that Agatha felt it like a physical blow. Vision was saying something, smiling, earnest, comfortable in a way that made Agatha’s stomach twist.</span></p><p><span>Agatha reached them in three strides.</span></p><p><span>She grabbed Wanda’s arm.</span></p><p><span>Not hard enough to hurt, but firm, decisive, impossible to ignore.</span></p><p><span>“Hey-” Wanda started, startled, spinning as Agatha yanked her around.</span></p><p><span>Their eyes met.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s chest was heaving. Her fingers trembled around Wanda’s wrist. Her voice came out low and rough and utterly final.</span></p><p><span>“I’m done.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda stared at her, dumbfounded. “Agatha- what?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t elaborate. She didn’t soften it. She didn’t lower her voice or look around to see who might be watching.</span></p><p><span>She simply let go and turned away.</span></p><p><span>Vision blinked, confused. “Wanda, is everything-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha was already gone.</span></p><p><span>She cut through the room, heart hammering, heat flooding her face, the echo of her own words ringing in her ears. Done. Done. Done.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t know what exactly she was done with, Westview, the pretending, the watching Wanda choose everyone else over and over again, but she knew one thing with terrifying clarity:</span></p><p><span>She couldn’t stay another second.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha!”</span></p><p><span>Billy’s voice broke through the haze.</span></p><p><span>She was almost to the staircase when he popped up in front of her, eyes bright, face flushed with excitement. “Hey! I was just looking for you- I talked to him, the guy I told you about, and it actually went really well and-”</span></p><p><span>“Not now,” Agatha snapped.</span></p><p><span>The words came out sharp, edged, louder than she meant them to be.</span></p><p><span>Billy flinched.</span></p><p><span>Agatha saw it, saw his smile falter, saw confusion and hurt flicker across his face, and for half a heartbeat guilt stabbed through her.</span></p><p><span>But it wasn’t enough to stop her.</span></p><p><span>“I’m sorry,” she added, but it was already too late, already hollow. “I can’t- just not now.”</span></p><p><span>She moved past him before he could say anything else.</span></p><p><span>Behind her, the party continued. Someone laughed too loudly. Someone called Wanda’s name. The music swelled.</span></p><p><span>Agatha took the stairs two at a time.</span></p><p><span>Her hands shook as she reached Wanda’s room. She didn’t bother closing the door gently. It slammed behind her with a crack that rattled the frame.</span></p><p><span>The room was too familiar.</span></p><p><span>The bed she had barely slept in last night. The dresser cluttered with Wanda’s things. The faint scent of her perfume in the air.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stood there for a second, chest rising and falling, staring at nothing.</span></p><p><span>Then she moved.</span></p><p><span>She went straight for her suitcase, yanking it out from where it sat half-packed under the bed. The zipper screamed as she dragged it open.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” she muttered to herself, voice tight. “Okay. We’re doing this.”</span></p><p><span>She crossed the room and started pulling clothes out of drawers without care, without folding. Sweaters, jeans, socks, anything that was hers went into the bag in an angry jumble.</span></p><p><span>Her hands were clumsy. A shirt slipped from her grip and fell to the floor.</span></p><p><span>“Fuck,” she hissed, swiping at her eyes when her vision blurred. “Fuck, fuck-”</span></p><p><span>She shoved shoes into the side pocket, not bothering to match them. Her toiletries followed, then her laptop, then the scarf she’d worn almost every day since arriving in Westview.</span></p><p><span>Each item felt like reclaiming something. Proof she hadn’t imagined this life she’d put on hold for Wanda.</span></p><p><span>Proof she could leave.</span></p><p><span>The door creaked open.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t turn around.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha?” Wanda’s voice was small. Careful. Like she was approaching a wild animal.</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed, a sharp, humorless sound. “Don’t.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda stepped inside anyway, closing the door softly behind her. “What are you doing?”</span></p><p><span>“What does it look like?” Agatha snapped, zipping one side of the suitcase with more force than necessary.</span></p><p><span>“You can’t just-” Wanda stopped herself, swallowed. “You didn’t even explain. You grabbed me and said you were done and ran-”</span></p><p><span>“Because I </span><em><span>am</span></em><span> done,” Agatha said, finally turning to face her.</span></p><p><span>Her eyes burned. Her face felt tight, like it might crack if she wasn’t careful.</span></p><p><span>“I am done watching you choose everyone else,” she continued, voice rising despite herself. “I am done being your secret. I am done standing in rooms full of people who think I’m your </span><em><span>roommate</span></em><span> while your ex-boyfriend practically has his hands on you.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s not fair,” Wanda said quickly. “You don’t understand-”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, I understand perfectly,” Agatha cut in. “I understand that when it comes down to it, you will always choose what’s easiest for </span><em><span>you</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s eyes filled. “That’s not true.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha scoffed. “You kissed him.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda froze.</span></p><p><span>Agatha pressed on, words spilling out now, unstoppable. “You didn’t even tell me until you were crying about how much you ‘loved’ me. You didn’t tell me until it was already done.”</span></p><p><span>“I was scared,” Wanda whispered. “I didn’t know what to do.”</span></p><p><span>“And you never do,” Agatha said bitterly. “So you let me take the hit instead.”</span></p><p><span>She turned back to the suitcase, slamming it shut.</span></p><p><span>“I’m leaving,” she said. “Tonight. I’ll get a hotel or a train or- something. I don’t care.”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha, please,” Wanda said, stepping closer. “Can we just talk about this? Not like this.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked at her then, really looked.</span></p><p><span>At the red-rimmed eyes. The trembling hands. The fear written all over her face.</span></p><p><span>And for the first time since arriving in Westview, Agatha didn’t soften.</span></p><p><span>“No,” she said quietly. “We’ve talked. We’ve talked every night since we got here, and somehow nothing ever changes.”</span></p><p><span>She grabbed the suitcase handle.</span></p><p><span>Wanda reached out, then stopped herself, her hand hovering uselessly in the air.</span></p><p><span>“I don’t want to lose you,” Wanda said, voice breaking.</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed hard.</span></p><p><span>“You already did,” she replied.</span></p><p><span>And with that, she hauled her bag toward the door, heart pounding, every step echoing with the certainty that whatever came next, whatever fallout waited downstairs, whatever explanations she’d have to give later, she could not stay here one more second pretending this didn’t hurt.</span></p><p><span>She opened the door.</span></p><p><span>The noise of the party rushed in.</span></p><p><span>But before she could step into the hallway, a hand shot out and gripped her wrist. Wanda’s other hand was suddenly on her shoulder, and in a dizzying motion, she spun Agatha back around. The motion was swift, unrelenting, and before Agatha could react, Wanda’s lips were on hers.</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze for a split second, caught off guard, but instinct kicked in and she pulled back sharply, eyes blazing. “A kiss isn’t going to magically fix everything, Wanda!” she yelled, voice cracking with the weight of everything she’d been holding in. “Do you think one kiss makes me forget the mess last night? Or the week we’ve been stuck in? Or everything else you’ve done?!”</span></p><p><span>Wanda stumbled back slightly, face flushed, eyes glistening. Her hands flew up defensively. “I…I just-”</span></p><p><span>“Just what?” Agatha snapped, taking a step closer, fury radiating from her. “You think your guilt or whatever little panic you’re feeling erases the fact that I’ve been…been just trying to survive all of this! Trying to survive being shoved around, being ignored, watching you lean into him!”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s lips trembled, and she pressed her hands to her face, voice shaking. “I… I see you with Rio, and I-”</span></p><p><span>“That’s exactly it!” Agatha interrupted, her voice rising even more. “Do you think I’ve been blind, Wanda? All the times you saw me laughing with her, sitting close to her, being…happy? I’ve been careful, trying to respect you, to respect us, and somehow, that wasn’t enough. And Rio…Rio’s the one person in this town who actually understands me. Who gets losing someone you care about, who knows what it’s like to feel trapped and powerless.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s hands dropped slowly from her face. Her lips parted, but no words came out. Agatha’s chest heaved as she continued, her voice softening slightly but still fierce.</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t do anything more than you did with Vision,” Agatha said, taking a deep, shuddering breath. “I didn’t lean in and almost kiss him in front of my entire family and GIRLFRIEND! I didn’t make choices that put us in this mess. I didn’t betray you, Wanda. But I also won’t pretend I don’t have needs. I won’t pretend I don’t have people who see me and understand me- and right now, Rio…she does. And she didn’t hurt me, Wanda. But you…you’re hurting me by keeping me in the dark, by pretending everything’s fine when it isn’t.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s mouth opened again, eyes wide and filled with shock. “Y-you kissed Rio?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s jaw tightened. She didn’t answer immediately, letting the weight of her words settle in the room, letting Wanda feel the truth of it. And then she did nothing but watch, her eyes never leaving Wanda’s face.</span></p><p><span>The realization hit Wanda in full force, and she stumbled backward, collapsing onto the bed. Her shoulders shook violently as tears streamed down her face, sobs echoing quietly through the room. Agatha froze, her own heart twisting at the sight, anger still burning but now mixed with a deep ache at the sight of Wanda crumbling before her.</span></p><p><span>The silence that followed was heavy, broken only by Wanda’s quiet, uncontrollable sobs. Agatha’s breathing was ragged. She wanted to say something, to make it better, to fix it, but the words stuck in her throat. For the first time in a long while, she let herself just watch, let herself sit in the moment, feeling the storm of emotions crash around both of them without trying to control it.</span></p><p><span>Agatha took a step back, bag still slung over her shoulder, and let herself sink onto the edge of the bed beside Wanda, careful not to touch her but close enough that her presence was tangible. She didn’t say anything. She didn’t move. She just let Wanda cry, let the room absorb the weight of what had happened.</span></p><p><span>The two of them sat like that, side by side, suspended in a fragile, painful quiet. Agatha’s mind kept drifting back to Rio, the laughter, the warmth, the feeling of being truly seen, and yet here she was, tethered to Wanda by years of history and heartbreak.</span></p><p><span>Eventually, Wanda’s sobs slowed, her body shuddering as she wiped at her tears. Agatha’s chest ached with a mix of anger, sorrow, and longing, her hands still trembling slightly. She wanted to comfort Wanda, wanted to make everything okay, but she also knew some things couldn’t be fixed with words alone.</span></p><p><span>Finally, Wanda let out a shaky breath and looked up at Agatha, eyes red but wary. Agatha, silent and exhausted, simply nodded. She wasn’t sure if it was a sign of truce or just a momentary pause in the chaos.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s voice wavered, fragile and desperate. “I- I’ll tell them. I’ll tell everyone that I’m gay and that you’re my girlfriend.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze, her chest tightening at the words. She wanted to respond, to tell her it wasn’t that simple, but before she could, Wanda pressed on.</span></p><p><span>“Wanda-” Agatha started, but Wanda’s eyes, wide and pleading, cut her off.</span></p><p><span>“I can’t force you to come out,” Agatha said sharply, her voice quieter now, but firm, tinged with both frustration and fatigue. “That’s your choice, Wanda. I can’t make it for you.”</span></p><p><span>“But…it’ll fix us, right?” Wanda asked, her voice breaking just slightly, full of hope and fear tangled together.</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed her eyes for a moment, letting out a long, shaky sigh. She tried to steady herself, tried to remember why she had fought so hard for her own autonomy, for her own truth. “I don’t know if it’ll fix us,” she admitted finally, her voice softer now, tinged with uncertainty. “Being out or not…it doesn’t erase the hurt, Wanda. It doesn’t erase everything that’s happened, all the ways we’ve misunderstood each other, all the mistakes we’ve made.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s lip trembled as she moved closer, hands hovering over Agatha’s, hesitant. “But it has to help, right? It has to make it better somehow.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head, a mix of exasperation and sorrow flooding her. “It might help. It might not. That’s not… it’s not the magic fix you’re hoping for. Being out doesn’t mean the problems go away. It doesn’t erase trust issues, miscommunication, or… hurt feelings.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s shoulders slumped slightly, but she still pressed, desperate. “But…if I told them… if I finally said it out loud, I’d finally be…I’d finally be fully with you. Wouldn’t that…?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed hard, her throat tight. She wanted to tell Wanda everything would be fine if she came out, but she also knew it wasn’t that simple. She couldn’t erase the layers of fear and hesitation that had built up in Wanda over years, and she couldn’t ignore the part of herself that felt… conflicted.</span></p><p><span>“I can’t make it okay for you, Wanda,” Agatha said softly, looking at her girlfriend with a mix of care and caution. “I can’t make coming out solve all this. I can’t pretend it’s that easy. And I… I can’t pretend I’m not thinking about…other things, too.” Her voice faltered slightly, and she looked away, trying to shove the thoughts of Rio from her mind, but failing.</span></p><p><span>Wanda blinked, confused, a little hurt. “Other things?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head quickly, forcing a small, bitter smile. “It’s nothing. Just…it’s complicated. I’m…I’m trying to figure out how we move forward without hurting each other more.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda bit her lip, nodding slowly, though her eyes betrayed the fear of losing Agatha, even as she tried to hold onto hope. “I just…I don’t want to lose you,” she whispered.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt a tug in her chest, a mix of frustration and longing. She wanted to tell Wanda that she wasn’t going anywhere, that she cared, that she understood her fear, but the truth was tangled in everything else. “I know,” Agatha said softly, her voice barely above a whisper. “But fixing things…it’s not about just coming out. It’s about how we handle what’s already broken, what we’ve already hurt in each other.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s eyes flickered with understanding and sadness, her hands dropping into her lap. The weight between them hung thick in the room, heavy with unsaid truths, shared guilt, and longing.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s thoughts drifted again, unwanted but persistent, to Rio- the way her presence had made Agatha feel understood, seen, and unafraid. The contrast was sharp and painful. She loved Wanda in her way, history and heart entwined, but Rio…Rio represented a freedom and acceptance Agatha had been craving. She hated herself slightly for even thinking about it now, but the truth didn’t care for timing or circumstance.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s soft voice pulled her back. “Agatha…are you listening?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked and nodded quickly, forcing herself back into the moment. “I am. I am listening.”</span></p><p><span>“But…do you think…maybe if I came out…we could…” Wanda trailed off, hesitant.</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head slowly, a small, wry, and tired smile ghosting her lips. “I don’t know if it’s that simple, Wanda. I really don’t. It might help. It might not. It doesn’t change…what we feel, what we’ve done, or what we’re trying to fix.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s lips trembled, and she shifted closer, but not too close, as if afraid of the answer. “Then what do we do?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hands found Wanda’s briefly, a gentle touch in the storm of their emotions. “We…figure it out. Together. One step at a time. But don’t think coming out will magically undo everything. That’s not how this works.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda nodded slowly, tears brimming but not spilling over, still clinging to hope. “Okay…together,” she whispered.</span></p><p><span>Wanda leaned in again, her lips brushing softly against Agatha’s, an almost hesitant gesture of intimacy, of reassurance. For a brief, perfect moment, the world outside the bedroom disappeared, the weight of the past, the guilt, the confusion, all of it suspended between them.</span></p><p><span>Then the door creaked open.</span></p><p><span>Both women’s heads snapped up simultaneously. Standing in the doorway was Marina, Pietro’s wife, her eyes wide in shock. “Oh my god,” she whispered, her hands flying to her mouth before she whirled around and rushed back down the stairs.</span></p><p><span>Agatha and Wanda froze, glancing at each other, a mixture of panic and disbelief flashing across their faces. After a moment, they instinctively bolted after her, weaving through the hallway and down the staircase two steps at a time.</span></p><p><span>As they reached the bottom, they skidded to a stop, taking in the scene. Marina was leaned over, her voice low and urgent as she whispered something to a very drunk Pietro, who was swaying slightly on his feet. Before anyone could intervene, Pietro’s voice cut through the room like a cannon.</span></p><p><span>“What do you mean my sister is gay?!” he bellowed, slurring the words, his arm gesturing wildly toward Wanda.</span></p><p><span>The room froze. Utter silence.</span></p>

<p><span>The silence didn’t shatter right away.</span></p><p><span>It stretched.</span></p><p><span>Billy let out a low, involuntary whistle from somewhere near the couch, quiet, but loud enough to feel like a crack in glass. Across the room, Rio’s eyes snapped to Agatha and Wanda, wide with an unmistakable </span><em><span>oh fuck</span></em><span>, softened immediately by something apologetic, something that said </span><em><span>I’m so sorry this is happening to you like this.</span></em></p><p><span>Iryna and Olek Maximoff had gone frighteningly still. Not frozen in shock, no, this was worse. This was the kind of stillness that came from control, from years of learning how to lock every reaction behind a carefully curated face. Iryna’s mouth was set in a thin, bloodless line. Olek’s jaw flexed once, sharply.</span></p><p><span>And Marina-</span></p><p><span>Marina stood very upright beside Pietro, one manicured hand still on his arm, her lips curved in something dangerously close to smug satisfaction. Like a secret had finally slipped loose in a way she hadn’t even had to orchestrate.</span></p><p><span>Before Agatha could fully process the fact that the room was now staring at Wanda like she was a cracked ornament about to fall off the tree, Wanda moved.</span></p><p><span>“N-no,” she said quickly, the word tumbling out too fast. She stepped forward, laughter bubbling up in her throat, too bright, too forced. “Pietro’s drunk. He- he misunderstood. That’s not what-”</span></p><p><span>“Wands,” Pietro interrupted, squinting at her as though trying to focus on a blurry sign. “I didn’t misunderstand. Marina just told me-”</span></p><p><span>“She’s wrong,” Wanda cut in sharply, turning toward Marina with a brittle smile. “You’re wrong.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt it then.</span></p><p><span>That familiar, sickening drop in her stomach. The sensation of the floor tilting, of reality bending in on itself. She watched Wanda do exactly what she’d done a hundred times before, what she’d done last night, what she’d done years ago with Rio.</span></p><p><span>Deny. Deflect. Disappear.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hands curled slowly into fists at her sides.</span></p><p><span>Wanda kept talking.</span></p><p><span>Laughing a little too loudly, shaking her head, waving a hand like this was all ridiculous. “He’s drunk,” she said again, words tumbling over each other. “Pietro’s wasted. He heard something wrong. You all know how he gets.”</span></p><p><span>Pietro blinked, frowning, swaying. “I’m not-” Marina elbowed him hard in the ribs, and he shut up with a grunt.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stayed perfectly still.</span></p><p><span>She felt like if she moved, even an inch, something inside her would crack clean in half.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s voice kept going, filling the space, trying desperately to plaster over the silence. “I don’t know what Marina thinks she saw, but she’s mistaken. This is… this is getting blown way out of proportion.”</span></p><p><span>That was when Agatha felt it.</span></p><p><span>Not the room. Not the stares. Not even Wanda’s words.</span></p><p><span>Rio.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t look at her at first. She couldn’t. But she felt it anyway, the weight of Rio’s gaze, steady and devastating. When Agatha finally turned her head just enough, their eyes met.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t look shocked.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t look angry.</span></p><p><span>She looked like she understood.</span></p><p><span>Like she was watching something she’d lived through already, something she’d survived but never really escaped. There was sorrow there, and something softer beneath it, an I see you, an I know exactly what this feels like. The look almost shattered Agatha where she stood.</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed hard and forced herself to look away.</span></p><p><span>Iryna’s voice cut through the room, sharp and controlled. “Wanda,” she said quietly.</span></p><p><span>That alone was enough to make the air go even tighter.</span></p><p><span>“Explain.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda turned toward her mother, eyes wide, smile strained. “There’s nothing to explain,” she said quickly. “I’m not gay. I don’t know why anyone would think that.”</span></p><p><span>Olek shifted beside Iryna, jaw tight, but he stayed silent.</span></p><p><span>“I’m serious,” Wanda pressed on, voice rising just a touch. “This is being taken completely out of context.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s chest ached.</span></p><p><span>She watched Wanda do it again, erase herself in real time, sand down the truth until there was nothing left sharp enough to hurt anyone but her.</span></p><p><span>Marina scoffed softly, arms crossing. “Out of context?” she said, eyebrows lifting. “I literally just walked in on you kissing her.” She nodded toward Agatha, unapologetic. “In the bedroom. Pretty clear context, if you ask me.”</span></p><p><span>The room shifted.</span></p><p><span>Every head turned.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt it like a physical thing, the collective gaze snapping onto her, the sudden heat crawling up her neck. Her stomach dropped so fast she thought she might actually be sick.</span></p><p><span>She looked back at Wanda.</span></p><p><span>Wanda was staring at her now, eyes wide and glassy, silently pleading. Don’t. Please. Don’t make this worse. Don’t say it.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s fists tightened at her sides.</span></p><p><span>This was it, the moment she’d sworn she’d never be in again. The moment where the truth sat right on her tongue, burning, begging to be spoken. The moment where saying nothing hurt just as much as saying everything.</span></p><p><span>She thought of her mother’s hand.</span></p><p><span>Of locked doors and whispered prayers and the word disgusting spat like a curse.</span></p><p><span>Of fighting tooth and nail to be herself.</span></p><p><span>Of Rio’s eyes.</span></p><p><span>Agatha took a breath.</span></p><p><span>Then another.</span></p><p><span>And then she lied.</span></p><p><span>“She isn’t,” Agatha said, voice steady despite the way her heart was trying to beat out of her chest. “Wanda isn’t gay.”</span></p><p><span>Vision’s voice cut through the murmurs with devastating clarity.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah,” he said, stepping forward, smooth and certain. “Wanda isn’t gay. Because we’re getting back together.”</span></p><p><span>It felt like the air was sucked out of the room.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t move at first. She didn’t blink. She simply watched as Vision crossed the space between them and came to Wanda’s side, his hand settling at the small of her back like it had always belonged there.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s face twisted, not in surprise, but in pain. A sharp, knowing grimace that said </span><em><span>I see it. I see all of it.</span></em><span> Her eyes flicked to Agatha, full of apology she hadn’t caused and grief she couldn’t fix.</span></p><p><span>Wanda hesitated for half a second.</span></p><p><span>Just half.</span></p><p><span>Then Vision leaned down and kissed her.</span></p><p><span>And Wanda melted into it.</span></p><p><span>Not stiff. Not uncertain. She softened, hands curling into his coat, body angling toward him like muscle memory had won. Like it was easier this way. Like this was safety.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt herself go cold.</span></p><p><span>Not numb- </span><em><span>hollow</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Something inside her collapsed so cleanly it was almost quiet. No explosion. No sharp crack. Just a sudden absence where hope had been.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t wait for the room to react.</span></p><p><span>She turned.</span></p><p><span>The movement was abrupt enough that Rio flinched. Agatha didn’t look at her. Didn’t look at Wanda. Didn’t look at anyone.</span></p><p><span>She was already walking.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha-” Billy’s voice caught up to her halfway to the stairs, urgent and confused. He stepped into her path, eyes wide, hands lifting like he could stop the inevitable. “Agatha, wait-”</span></p><p><span>She shoved past him.</span></p><p><span>Not hard, but desperate.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t,” she snapped, the word breaking on the way out as she took the stairs two at a time.</span></p><p><span>Her chest burned.</span></p><p><span>Her lungs wouldn’t cooperate.</span></p><p><span>She barely made it up the stairs before the tears came, hot and violent, blurring the banister, the framed family photos on the walls, the familiar curve of the hallway she’d walked a hundred times this week. Wanda’s door was open. Agatha didn’t hesitate. She shoved inside and slammed it shut behind her with enough force to rattle the windows.</span></p><p><span>She slid down against it, her back hitting the wood hard, fingers clawing uselessly at the fabric of her dress as a sound tore out of her chest that didn’t even feel human.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t just crying.</span></p><p><span>It was a breaking.</span></p><p><span>Her shoulders shook as she folded in on herself, forehead pressed to her knees, breath coming in sharp, panicked gasps that burned her throat. Her mind replayed it over and over, Vision’s voice, confident and calm. </span><em><span>We’re getting back together.</span></em><span> The way he’d moved without hesitation. The way Wanda had let him. The way she’d leaned in like gravity had finally claimed her.</span></p><p><span>Like Agatha had never been there at all.</span></p><p><span>Erased.</span></p><p><span>That was the word that lodged itself in her chest and refused to leave.</span></p><p><span>She laughed once, broken and wet. “Of course,” she whispered to the empty room. “Of course.”</span></p><p><span>She had known. Hadn’t she?</span></p><p><span>She’d known the moment Wanda denied it. The moment she watched her choose safety over truth. The moment Agatha felt herself shoved, once again, into the dark, into silence, into the space where love went to disappear.</span></p><p><span>Her fingers dug into her arms, nails biting through fabric as if she could anchor herself to something real. She rocked forward, then back, breath hitching, tears soaking into the skirt of her dress.</span></p><p><span>“I wasn’t enough,” she said aloud, the words tumbling out whether she wanted them to or not. “I was never enough.”</span></p><p><span>She had fought so hard to be herself. To be out. To be </span><em><span>real</span></em><span>. And here she was again, watching someone she loved choose a version of life that didn’t include her because it was easier. Quieter. Safer.</span></p><p><span>Her chest ached like it might split open.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t know how long she stayed like that, minutes, maybe longer, before a knock sounded softly at the door.</span></p><p><span>Agatha flinched.</span></p><p><span>“Go away, Wanda,” she choked, wiping at her face with the heel of her hand even though it didn’t help. “I mean it. Just-just leave me alone.”</span></p><p><span>There was a pause.</span></p><p><span>Then, gently: “It’s not Wanda.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze.</span></p><p><span>Her breath caught painfully in her throat.</span></p><p><span>“It’s Rio,” the voice continued, careful, steady. “And I’m… I’m coming in, okay?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha barely had time to process it before the door creaked open.</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped inside and the sight of he nearly undid Agatha all over again.</span></p><p><span>Her expression changed instantly. The moment Rio’s eyes landed on her, something sharp and protective flickered across her face, the playful warmth she usually wore stripped away and replaced with something raw and furious and achingly gentle all at once.</span></p><p><span>“Oh,” Rio breathed.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t get another second.</span></p><p><span>Rio crossed the room in three strides and dropped to her knees in front of her, hands framing Agatha’s face without hesitation, thumbs brushing under her eyes.</span></p><p><span>“Hey,” she murmured, voice low and soothing. “Hey, hey, hey… look at me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha tried.</span></p><p><span>She really did.</span></p><p><span>But the moment she met Rio’s gaze, something in her completely gave out. A sob tore free from her chest and she collapsed forward, burying her face into Rio’s shoulder, fingers fisting desperately into the back of her dress like it was the only thing keeping her upright.</span></p><p><span>Rio wrapped around her instantly.</span></p><p><span>Arms solid and sure, one hand splayed wide between Agatha’s shoulder blades, the other cradling the back of her head. She rocked them gently, pressing her cheek against Agatha’s hair.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve got you,” Rio whispered. “I’ve got you. You’re okay. You’re safe.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head violently against her shoulder. “I’m not,” she sobbed. “I’m really not.”</span></p><p><span>“I know,” Rio said softly, without a trace of doubt. “I know.”</span></p><p><span>She pressed a kiss into Agatha’s hair, then another, slow, grounding, reverent, each one like a quiet promise. She didn’t rush her. Didn’t tell her to breathe. Didn’t ask questions.</span></p><p><span>She just held her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hands slid up, gripping Rio’s neck like she might disappear if she let go. Her whole body trembled, grief rolling through her in waves so strong it left her dizzy.</span></p><p><span>“She-she looked at me,” Agatha choked out. “She looked at me like she was asking permission to erase me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s arms tightened.</span></p><p><span>“I saw,” she said quietly.</span></p><p><span>“She didn’t even hesitate,” Agatha went on, voice breaking. “He said it and she just- she let him. Like that was it. Like everything we had was just… a phase she could tuck away when it got inconvenient.”</span></p><p><span>Rio swallowed hard, jaw tightening, but her voice stayed gentle. “That’s not a reflection of you.”</span></p><p><span>“It feels like it is,” Agatha whispered. “It feels like I was something she could love in secret but never choose out loud.”</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned back just enough to look at her, hands still firm and warm on Agatha’s arms. Her eyes were fierce now, shining with unshed tears of her own.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” she said carefully, “you were not erased because you were lacking. You were erased because </span><em><span>she’s afraid</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed weakly. “That doesn’t make it hurt less.”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Rio agreed. “It doesn’t.”</span></p><p><span>She brushed her thumb along Agatha’s jaw, wiping away a tear that slipped free. “But I need you to hear this anyway.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s breath stuttered as she nodded.</span></p><p><span>“You didn’t imagine what you had,” Rio said. “You weren’t wrong. You weren’t foolish. You weren’t asking for too much. You loved honestly. Out loud. And that terrifies people who haven’t learned how to do that yet.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s face crumpled again.</span></p><p><span>“I just wanted her to choose me,” she whispered. “Just once.”</span></p><p><span>Rio pulled her back in, pressing a kiss to her temple this time, then to her cheek, soft, grounding, utterly unselfconscious.</span></p><p><span>“You deserve someone who does,” she murmured. “Someone who doesn’t need to be brave </span><em><span>someday</span></em><span>. Someone who can be brave </span><em><span>now</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha clung to her as another wave hit, her body sagging with exhaustion. Rio shifted them carefully, easing Agatha back until she was sitting against the edge of the bed, Rio still kneeling between her legs, arms never leaving her.</span></p><p><span>Rio reached up and brushed Agatha’s hair back from her face, fingers gentle where they traced her scalp.</span></p><p><span>“Look at me,” she said again, quieter this time.</span></p><p><span>Agatha did.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s expression was open. Earnest. Achingly kind.</span></p><p><span>“I’m so sorry,” Rio said. “I know this hurts in ways that don’t heal quickly.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed hard. “I don’t know how to stay here,” she admitted. “I don’t know how to be in this house after that.”</span></p><p><span>“You don’t have to stay here, okay?,” Rio replied immediately. “But right now, you just have to breathe.”</span></p><p><span>She demonstrated, slow and steady, until Agatha found herself matching it despite the tightness in her chest.</span></p><p><span>“There you go,” Rio murmured. “Good.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s tears slowed, though they didn’t stop. She sagged forward again, forehead resting against Rio’s collarbone.</span></p><p><span>“She didn’t even look for me,” Agatha said quietly. “After.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hand stilled for half a second before resuming its soothing rhythm. “That’s on her,” she said. “Not you.”</span></p><p><span>They stayed like that for a long time.</span></p><p><span>Rio whispering reassurances. Pressing soft kisses into Agatha’s hair, her cheek, her temple. Wiping away tears as they came. Holding her like there was nowhere else she needed to be.</span></p><p><span>Eventually, Agatha’s sobs softened into quiet, shuddering breaths. Exhaustion settled deep in her bones, heavy and unavoidable.</span></p><p><span>Rio noticed immediately.</span></p><p><span>“Hey,” she said softly. “Stay with me. Don’t disappear.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha huffed out a weak, humorless breath. “Hard to disappear when everything hurts.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled sadly and brushed her thumb under Agatha’s eye. “You don’t have to be strong tonight.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded, eyes fluttering closed for just a moment.</span></p><p><span>“Rio?” she whispered.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah?”</span></p><p><span>“Thank you,” Agatha said. “For coming up here.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s voice was steady when she answered, but her eyes shone. “There was nowhere else I was going to be.”</span></p><p><span>She leaned forward and pressed one last gentle kiss to Agatha’s forehead, lingering there like a vow.</span></p><p><span>Agatha barely registered the sound of the door slamming open.</span></p><p><span>She was still curled in on herself on the floor, pressed against the bed, Rio’s arms wrapped tight around her, forehead pressed to Agatha’s temple, breathing slow and steady like she was trying to anchor them both to the same point in the universe. Agatha’s face was blotchy and wrecked, eyes swollen, chest aching in that deep, hollow way that came from something being taken from you while you were still holding it.</span></p><p><span>The door banged against the wall.</span></p><p><span>Agatha flinched hard.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha-” Wanda’s voice came out breathless, frantic, like she’d run the whole way up the stairs. “Agatha, please, I-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha went rigid instantly. Every muscle in her body locked, her hands curling into the fabric of Rio’s dress like she might fall apart if she let go.</span></p><p><span>Rio felt it immediately.</span></p><p><span>Her arms tightened, one hand sliding up to cradle the back of Agatha’s head protectively, her body angling just slightly so she was between Agatha and the doorway without even thinking about it.</span></p><p><span>Wanda took another step into the room and stopped.</span></p><p><span>Her eyes landed on the sight in front of her: Agatha folded into Rio’s chest, Rio holding her like it was the most natural thing in the world.</span></p><p><span>Something sharp flickered across Wanda’s face. Jealousy. Hurt. Anger. Fear. All tangled together.</span></p><p><span>“Oh,” Wanda said, forcing a thin smile that didn’t reach her eyes. “I see you’re… busy.”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t look at her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t move.</span></p><p><span>Wanda swallowed, then squared her shoulders. “Agatha, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean for any of that to happen downstairs. Pietro was drunk, Marina was being- well, Marina- and Vision just- he just stepped in because he thought it would help.”</span></p><p><span>A small, broken sound escaped Agatha’s throat.</span></p><p><span>Rio felt it vibrate against her chest.</span></p><p><span>“That helped?” Rio asked quietly, finally lifting her head.</span></p><p><span>Her voice wasn’t loud. It didn’t need to be.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s eyes snapped to her. “I didn’t ask for your commentary, Rio.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw tightened.</span></p><p><span>Wanda turned back to Agatha, softening her voice. “Agatha, please. Look at me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha couldn’t.</span></p><p><span>She stared at the floor, at the pattern in the rug, anywhere but Wanda’s face. If she looked, she might shatter all over again.</span></p><p><span>Wanda stepped closer. “Agatha, I can handle this. You don’t need-” she gestured vaguely toward Rio, “-help.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s arms tightened again, subtle but firm.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s fingers dug into Rio’s sleeve.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t,” Agatha whispered hoarsely.</span></p><p><span>Wanda froze. “Don’t… what?”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t talk like that,” Agatha said, voice shaking. “Don’t act like she’s the problem.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s lips pressed together. Her eyes flicked between them again, something dark settling in her gaze. “I’m just saying, you didn’t have to run off with her. You could’ve talked to me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a short, hysterical laugh. “Talked to you?”</span></p><p><span>“Yes,” Wanda said defensively. “I was trying to fix things.”</span></p><p><span>“By kissing Vision?” Agatha shot back, finally looking up.</span></p><p><span>Wanda flinched.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s head snapped toward Wanda now, anger blazing openly across her face.</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s voice rose. “That was different.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stood abruptly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s body reacted instantly, curling inward as Rio’s arms left her, like she’d been exposed to cold air without warning.</span></p><p><span>Rio turned fully to face Wanda, fists clenched at her sides. “Different how?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda scoffed. “Oh, don’t start. This isn’t about you.”</span></p><p><span>“It is when you keep doing the same damn thing,” Rio snapped. “You don’t get to pretend this is new.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s eyes widened. “What are you talking about?”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed humorlessly. “You really don’t remember it that way, do you?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut.</span></p><p><span>“Remember what?” Wanda demanded.</span></p><p><span>“High school,” Rio said, voice rising. “The secret dating. The pretending. The way you dropped me the second it was inconvenient.”</span></p><p><span>“That is not fair,” Wanda snapped. “I was scared.”</span></p><p><span>“So was I!” Rio shouted. “And you threw me under the bus to save yourself.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shot to her feet.</span></p><p><span>“Enough!”</span></p><p><span>Both women froze.</span></p><p><span>Agatha was shaking, breath coming fast and uneven, eyes blazing with a mixture of fury and devastation. She reached out, grabbing Rio’s wrist, grounding herself as much as pulling Rio back.</span></p><p><span>“Enough,” Agatha repeated, voice cracking. “Both of you.”</span></p><p><span>She turned to Wanda first.</span></p><p><span>“You don’t get to accuse me of cheating,” Agatha said sharply. “Not after what I just watched downstairs. Not after everything I’ve swallowed for you.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s face crumpled. “Agatha, I didn’t-”</span></p><p><span>“You did,” Agatha cut in. “You chose him. Again. In front of everyone. And you let me disappear.”</span></p><p><span>Tears spilled down Wanda’s cheeks. “I was trying to protect us.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head. “You were protecting yourself.”</span></p><p><span>Silence fell heavy between them.</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned then, still holding Rio’s hand, and faced her. “And you-” her voice softened slightly, “-you don’t need to fight my battles for me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s expression faltered. “I just-”</span></p><p><span>“I know,” Agatha said quietly. “I know why you did it. And thank you. But I need this to stop before I completely lose my mind.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded slowly, stepping back just enough to give Agatha space, but she didn’t let go.</span></p><p><span>Agatha took a steadying breath, then looked back at Wanda.</span></p><p><span>“I’m leaving,” she said. “I’ll be out of the house in a few minutes.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s head snapped up. “What? No- Agatha, please. We can still fix this.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s voice was exhausted now. “Not tonight. Maybe not ever. I don’t know. But I can’t stay.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda opened her mouth to argue, then seemed to deflate all at once. She nodded stiffly, tears still streaming down her face.</span></p><p><span>“Fine,” she whispered. “Do whatever you want.”</span></p><p><span>She turned and stormed out, slamming the door behind her so hard the walls rattled.</span></p><p><span>For a split second, everything went utterly still.</span></p><p><span>Then Agatha exhaled, sharp, broken, like she’d been holding her breath for years and only just realized it.</span></p><p><span>Her hands were still clenched at her sides, nails biting into her palms, her chest rising and falling too fast. The echo of Wanda’s footsteps down the hall faded, leaving behind only the hum of blood in her ears and the ache that lived deep in her ribs.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t think. She didn’t plan.</span></p><p><span>She turned.</span></p><p><span>Rio barely had time to register the look on Agatha’s face before Agatha crossed the room and slammed her back against the wall.</span></p><p><span>The sound was solid, final.</span></p><p><span>Rio gasped, her breath punched from her lungs as Agatha’s hands fisted in her hair and her mouth crashed against Rio’s.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t careful.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t gentle.</span></p><p><span>It was all teeth and desperation and months of swallowed words erupting at once.</span></p><p><span>For half a heartbeat, Rio froze. Her brain scrambled to catch up, Agatha’s mouth, Agatha’s hands, Agatha shaking like she might fall apart if she stopped moving.</span></p><p><span>Then Rio melted.</span></p><p><span>Her hands came up instinctively, gripping Agatha’s waist, anchoring her, kissing her back just as fiercely. She tasted salt, tears still clinging to Agatha’s lips, and something raw and electric sparked between them, lighting every nerve ending on fire.</span></p><p><span>Agatha kissed like she was proving something. Like she was daring the universe to take this from her too.</span></p><p><span>Rio kissed her like she wasn’t going anywhere.</span></p><p><span>When they finally broke apart, both of them were breathing hard, foreheads pressed together, the space between them buzzing with something dangerous and alive.</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a shaky laugh that sounded one breath away from a sob.</span></p><p><span>“I-” She swallowed. Pulled back just enough to look at Rio, really look at her. “I need to get my stuff.”</span></p><p><span>The words came out steadier than she felt.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hands lingered at her waist, reluctant. “Okay,” she said softly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned away, taking a step toward the bed, toward the half-packed bag she’d abandoned earlier.</span></p><p><span>Rio caught her wrist.</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned back on instinct, and Rio used the momentum to pull her gently, so much gentler this time, back into her.</span></p><p><span>This kiss was different.</span></p><p><span>Slower. Intentional.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hand came up to cradle Agatha’s jaw, her thumb brushing softly along her cheek, wiping away a tear Agatha hadn’t even realized had fallen. The kiss was tender, grounding, like an anchor dropped straight into Agatha’s chest.</span></p><p><span>When Rio pulled back, she rested her forehead against Agatha’s.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve got you,” she murmured. Not a promise she was asking permission to make, just a statement of fact.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s throat tightened. She nodded once, sharp and grateful, then stepped back before she could lose her nerve.</span></p><p><span>“Help me,” she said quietly.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t hesitate.</span></p><p><span>They moved around the room together, an unspoken rhythm settling between them. Rio grabbed clothes from the dresser while Agatha shoved things into her bag with less care than she normally would. It wasn’t neat. It wasn’t organized.</span></p><p><span>It didn’t need to be.</span></p><p><span>Every so often, Agatha would freeze- her gaze snagging on something familiar. A sweater she’d borrowed from Wanda months ago. A memory threatening to pull her under.</span></p><p><span>Each time, Rio was there.</span></p><p><span>A hand on her back. A quiet, “Hey.” A steady presence pulling her forward again.</span></p><p><span>At one point, Agatha sank down onto the edge of the bed, the weight of everything finally pressing in on her chest. Rio knelt in front of her without a word, hands resting lightly on Agatha’s knees.</span></p><p><span>“You don’t have to be strong right now,” Rio said softly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha huffed out a breath. “I’m not.”</span></p><p><span>“I know.”</span></p><p><span>For a moment, Agatha just looked at her. Really looked. At the way Rio’s expression was open, unguarded. At the absence of fear there, no flinching, no denial, no shame.</span></p><p><span>Something inside Agatha loosened.</span></p><p><span>“Thank you,” she whispered.</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled, small and real. “Anytime.”</span></p><p><span>They finished packing quickly after that.</span></p><p><span>Agatha zipped the bag closed with a final tug, standing straighter than she had all night. She slung it over her shoulder, rolling it once like she was testing the weight of her own decision.</span></p><p><span>She glanced around the room one last time.</span></p><p><span>Then she turned to Rio.</span></p><p><span>“I’m ready.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded. She reached for Agatha’s hand, threading their fingers together like it was the most natural thing in the world.</span></p><p><span>Agatha and Rio stepped out of the bedroom together.</span></p><p><span>The hallway felt too bright, too loud, even though the party noise downstairs had dulled to an indistinct hum. Agatha’s chest was still tight, every breath scraping on the way in, but Rio’s hand was steady in hers, warm, grounding. It was the only thing keeping her upright.</span></p><p><span>They reached the top of the stairs, and that was when Agatha saw Billy.</span></p><p><span>He was standing at the bottom, half-hidden by the banister, like he’d been hovering there for a while, pretending not to wait. His eyes flicked up the moment he sensed them, and whatever expression he’d been wearing, curiosity, concern, something hopeful, fell away when he saw Agatha’s face.</span></p><p><span>Agatha squeezed Rio’s hand once. “Give me just a second,” she murmured.</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded immediately, no questions, loosening her grip without letting go completely until Agatha stepped away. She stayed where she was, a quiet presence at the top of the stairs, watching.</span></p><p><span>Agatha descended slowly. Each step felt heavier than the last. Billy met her halfway, opening his mouth like he was about to launch into something, probably fast, probably sarcastic, probably carefully casual.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t let him.</span></p><p><span>She crossed the remaining distance and pulled him into her arms.</span></p><p><span>Billy stiffened in surprise for half a second before he melted into it, wrapping his arms around her with a force that knocked the air from her lungs.</span></p><p><span>“Jesus, kid,” Agatha muttered into his shoulder, half-laughing, half-choked. “Trying to crack a rib?”</span></p><p><span>He squeezed tighter.</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed her eyes.</span></p><p><span>For a moment, she let herself just exist there, his solid warmth, the fierce way he clung to her, the unspoken understanding humming between them. When she pulled back, she kept her hands on his shoulders, grounding herself.</span></p><p><span>“Hey,” she said softly.</span></p><p><span>Billy looked up at her, eyes a little too bright. “You okay?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted quietly. “Define okay.”</span></p><p><span>That earned her a small, shaky smile.</span></p><p><span>She inhaled, steadying herself. “Listen to me,” she said, her voice dropping, firm in a way she rarely let anyone hear. “You don’t owe this family- or anyone- pieces of yourself just to keep the peace. Not now. Not ever.”</span></p><p><span>Billy swallowed.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t let them shrink you,” she continued. “Don’t let them convince you that loving who you love is something you have to justify or hide or earn. You hear me?”</span></p><p><span>He nodded, fast.</span></p><p><span>“I’m really proud of you,” Agatha added, quieter now. “For who you are. For who you’re becoming.”</span></p><p><span>Billy scoffed, scrubbing at his face. “Wow. This is dangerously close to a heartfelt speech.”</span></p><p><span>She smirked. “Careful. I’ll ruin it by saying something mean next.”</span></p><p><span>That did it. He laughed, real laughter, snorting a little, and Agatha felt something in her chest loosen.</span></p><p><span>“Go,” Billy said, jerking his chin toward the front door. “Before someone starts another emotional hostage situation.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned in and bumped her forehead lightly against his. “Don’t be a stranger, Maximoff.”</span></p><p><span>He grinned. “You’re the one fleeing town.”</span></p><p><span>She turned, already backing away. “Yeah, well. Try not to burn the place down without me.”</span></p><p><span>She didn’t look back again until she reached the living room.</span></p><p><span>Rio was waiting near the edge of it, coat already on, dark eyes tracking Agatha the moment she reappeared. Relief flickered across her face, soft and unguarded.</span></p><p><span>Without a word, Rio reached for her hand.</span></p><p><span>Agatha took it.</span></p><p><span>They moved together toward the front door, weaving past half-empty glasses and abandoned conversations. The house felt different now, smaller, tighter, like it was already rejecting her.</span></p><p><span>Just before they reached the door, a voice stopped them.</span></p><p><span>“I see you chose a booth.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze.</span></p><p><span>Lilia stood near the entryway, arms crossed loosely, expression unreadable but sharp with knowing. Her gaze flicked between Agatha and Rio’s joined hands.</span></p><p><span>Rio glanced between them, brow furrowing. “A… booth?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha met Lilia’s eyes.</span></p><p><span>Something unspoken passed between them, recognition, maybe. Or approval. Or simply the acknowledgment that some lessons, once learned, couldn’t be unlearned.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah,” Agatha said evenly. “I did.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia’s lips twitched. “Good choice.”</span></p><p><span>That was all she said before stepping aside.</span></p><p><span>Once they were outside, the cold hit Agatha like a shock. She sucked in a breath, the night air crisp and clean, and only then did she realize how loud her thoughts had been until now.</span></p><p><span>She started talking immediately.</span></p><p><span>“Okay, so- I didn’t exactly plan this part,” she said, words tumbling out. “There’s a late train back to the city, I think, or I could grab a hotel, or- hell, I could probably sleep at the station if I had to-”</span></p><p><span>Rio stopped walking.</span></p><p><span>Agatha took one more step before realizing she was being pulled back.</span></p><p><span>Then Rio kissed her.</span></p><p><span>Not frantic. Not desperate.</span></p><p><span>Certain.</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze for half a heartbeat before melting into it, her hands curling into Rio’s coat like it was the only solid thing left in the world. When Rio pulled back, she rested their foreheads together.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Rio said softly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked up at her. “Yeah?”</span></p><p><span>“Come home with me.”</span></p><p><span>The words were simple. Steady. No pressure wrapped inside them, just an open door.</span></p><p><span>Agatha searched her face. “Are you… are you sure?”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled, something warm and stubborn and impossibly gentle. “I’ve spent the last week trying to convince you that Christmas doesn’t have to suck,” she said. “I’m not giving up now.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha huffed out a breath that might’ve been a laugh or a sob. “You’re really bad at backing down.”</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned in, brushing her nose against Agatha’s. “Only when it matters.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded slowly.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” she said. “Okay.”</span></p>
