    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>
  <span>Agatha has a routine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not because she’s fond of them. Not because she can’t live in the chaos— she can. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She has a routine because her life </span>
  <em>
    <span>requires </span>
  </em>
  <span>her to have a routine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But she is, by definition, a workaholic. She spends most of her hours at the office. She stays at the office more than she should. She takes work back home with her. She lets work calls interrupt her time outside the office, too. So, the inescapable outcome of it is that her routine is tied around her work.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She feeds Señor Scratchy first thing in the morning and sips her own coffee at the sound of him nibbling on his food. She gives him a few long pets before leaving for work— she used to walk there, in her younger years, and she used to drive there, in her younger-yet-older years, and now she just sits in the backseat of the car as her driver feels the stress of the shit drivers in Manhattan. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s in the backseat she first checks on her phone— the phone is never out of her reach, she won’t lie, but she knows that if anything urgent was happening, she’d get a call. So, instead, she reads and answers the emails full of problems and solutions idiots in the lower levels of the firm couldn’t find or solve. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pitt’s Corporate building always looks boringly the same each day she drives into it— it’s not the highest building in Midtown Manhattan and not the lowest— security on every entrance and protesters of any kind— environmental activist, feminist or heartbroken families and their supporters— complaining with signs and chants outside its doors. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The pits</span>
  </em>
  <span>, as most people that work on the company call it, don’t have the best reputation in the media or the general population— it has the reputation that matters, though. It gets people out of trouble, big and horrible and should-have-never-come-to-light kind of trouble. So much so that people took on the employees nickname, gave it a new meaning and started calling it </span>
  <em>
    <span>the pits of hell</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha has no issues being considered one of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>wicked witches of the pits of hell</span>
  </em>
  <span>. She actually quite likes it. She loves the way people look at her with something in the middle of fear and respect when she mentions her job. She always gets a trill out of the people that start to point out just how bad the company is— she truly doesn’t care. And she has no trouble ignoring the hypocrisy of the people that also wouldn’t care if they had the same paycheck as her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s morning routine ends the second she finishes the elevator ride and walks into her office. It is perfect almost every day— she’d even dare say it </span>
  <em>
    <span>is </span>
  </em>
  <span>perfect every day, except for the days she has the misfortune of walking into Rio Vidal on her way up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She used to like it, once upon a time. She used to hope Rio’s ridiculously expensive motorcycle would pull up into the parking lot at the same time her driver would stop the car. She used to watch her, intensively, as she took off her helmet and then found Agatha’s eyes before smirking. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now, every time the elevator doors are stopped by perfectly manicured hands, Agatha has to suppress a groan and instead, she rolls her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Surprise,” Rio says, in that stupidly annoying voice of her, as if Agatha didn’t know it was her hand stopping the elevator— as if Agatha hadn’t seen her in the lobby and had hurried into the elevator just to avoid this exact situation. “So, did you see the game last night?” Rio asks, after Agatha doesn’t say anything back and the silence surrounds them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t watch sports,” she answers, scoffing, because Rio knows that, she knows that, “and you don’t, either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I wouldn’t know if you do,” Rio’s back lays against the mirror walls and her blazer opens up, showing an almost see through white shirt when she places her hands on the golden railing of the elevator. It used to be one of the things that first caught Agatha’s attention, the way she could take up so much space and own it, when she wanted to, and then basically go unnoticed— all at the will of her own mind and body. “Maybe you picked up some new hobbies,” she keeps going, “Maybe football? Or maybe you liked watching professional swimming and decided to try it. You would look ridiculously hot in those swimsuits.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio has the nerve of winking once she finishes talking. Agatha crosses her arms, “Well, you won’t be finding out anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please,” Rio says, “I already know </span>
  <em>
    <span>just </span>
  </em>
  <span>how hot you look. And I like to use a little imagination to think of other scenarios.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I know that one. Imagination,” Agatha snarls, “I use that all the time when I think about squeezing the life out of you.”</span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>“Come on, Agatha,” Rio whispers, sultry and slowly, as she gets closer to her, the tip of their noses momentarily touching before Agatha pulls away, “You know that would turn me on even more.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She walks out of the elevator behind Rio in somewhat of a daze— Rio walks away with the confidence and easiness she always possesses and Agatha hates, just </span>
  <em>
    <span>hates</span>
  </em>
  <span>, how much she gets under her skin. With just a few looks. With just a few words. No one had ever had that power over her— until Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wants to say it’s all hate but deep down, a part of her is yearning and nostalgia because sometimes, and only sometimes, she misses her— but she burns and beats away that small part of her and reminds herself that she hates Rio. She hates her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harkness,” Jac, her boss, greets her before she gives her a file, “I need you to read over these numbers from Stark Industries. They’re getting sued for a patent again. You’re with Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck,” she whispers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s not the first time she’s worked with Rio and probably won’t be the last. They work well together, even as much as Agatha hates it— and she’s tried to get out of these cases together enough times to know Jac will simply refuse her. Won cases are more important than Agatha’s annoyance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The numbers on Stark’s case are perfect, as usual— perfect enough for Agatha to know it’s more suspicious than relaxing but that is not for her to care. She knows the case will go Stark Industries’ way anyway. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her phone ringing takes her away from the pages in front of her. She groans when she looks at it. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Mother.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She declines the call.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hopes it’s one of those days Evanora respects her office hours and doesn’t call again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s not. Her phone rings again a few seconds later. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m working,” Agatha says, answering the phone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re always working,” Evanora says. “I’m calling to know when are you arriving for Halloween.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She doesn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>ask</span>
  </em>
  <span>. She doesn’t wonder </span>
  <em>
    <span>if </span>
  </em>
  <span>Agatha will go home for Halloween. She expects her to be there and throw a rampage if Agatha isn’t. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It could be worse, she knows. Halloween is the only holiday her mother cares about— none of that Christmas bullshit or New Year ridicules. But being from Salem, her mother and everyone in their neighborhood take Halloween very seriously— </span>
  <em>
    <span>too </span>
  </em>
  <span>seriously, in Agatha’s opinion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t decided yet,” Agatha tells her. It’s not far from the truth. She hasn’t decided whether to </span>
  <em>
    <span>go </span>
  </em>
  <span>or not but her mother doesn’t need to know that. “I have a new case that’s been taking up my time,” another lie but oh well, who cares. She certainly doesn’t.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, decide,” Evanora snaps. “I expect you here on the 30th, at the </span>
  <em>
    <span>latest</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she says, “Do you understand?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure,” Agatha says, annoyed. Angry, more like. It’s the same thing every year. Go back home and repeat the same stupid conversations with the same stupid people from her hometown who are so proud of their pathetic and un-grand lives and who somehow petty Agatha for hers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” her mother answers. She can hear the exasperation in her voice, too. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She knows exactly what would shut her up. What would shut all of them up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio knocks on her door— Agatha had watched from the glass walls of her office as she moved from the other side of the room, where her office is, to Agatha’s office. Agatha holds up a finger to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m taking someone with me,” Agatha says, suddenly and recklessly. “My girlfriend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Evanora’s hitched breath is the only answer for a few seconds. “Is that necessary?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. I will see you soon. Goodbye,” Agatha says, hanging up the phone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her fingers instantly find her forehead as she throws herself back into her chair and it rolls back. She feels the tension of a future headache— just like she always does after talking to her mother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You okay, sweetheart?” Rio asks, walking in and sitting down on the chair in front of Agatha and pulling her feet up on the desk, red folder on her hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t call me that,” Agatha says, “You’ll make my headache even worse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hums, amused, and looks to the phone then at Agatha. “I’m guessing that was the renowned Judge Evanora Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Obviously,” Agatha says, rolling her eyes. She looks Rio up and down, trying to ignore the small thrill it brings to her bones to see her in her office— flashes of the many nights they’ve both stayed past work hours here to do anything but work. “Would you like to piss her off?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Rio says, “Your mother?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My mother,” Agatha confirms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha has heard Rio’s last name for as long as she can remember. Evanora would always come back home cursing the Vidal name and everyone in its bloodline. The Vidals were involved in shady business— or at least that’s what Agatha’s mother always thought. And no matter how many times she’s prosecuted someone from that family in court, they had gotten away with whatever crime they were trailed for. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A girlfriend would be enough to piss off her mother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio </span>
  <em>
    <span>Vidal </span>
  </em>
  <span>as her girlfriend would make her mother furious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want to go with me to Salem for halloween?” Agatha asks, then sweeps her tongue over her teeth, unsure. “As my…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe she should think more about this. Rio would piss off her mother, sure. But Rio would also annoy the fuck ot of her. Could she really spend two days beside Rio? Would both of them make it out of that situation alive?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As your…” Rio trails off, her eyebrows high. There’s that annoying smirk on her face. Rio knows what Agatha is going to say but she’d never accept that easily. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Girlfriend,” grumbles, then corrects herself, “Fake girlfriend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio will make Agatha ask— beg, if she can, just to say yes. She’s always been like this. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure,” is all Rio says. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure?” Agatha repeats, then frowns. “Just like that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” she shrugs her shoulders, “Sounds fun. I don't have better plans for Halloween.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighs. Silence falls over the room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I still hate you,” she says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Rio says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s feet come down from the desk and she sits up straighter, she opens the folder in her lap and takes a sheet out of it. Agatha takes it and compares its numbers against the ones she had been reading before. With no words between them, they get back to work.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Did you not bring Scratchy?” Rio asks, once they were both sitting down on the plane. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s a rabbit,” Agatha says, annoyed, “of course not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where is he?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Left him at home with his expensive feeding machine and more toys he could ever play with,” Agatha rolls her eyes. “What do you care, anyway?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, that’s so mean,” Rio says, placing a hand on her chest in a fake-offended way. “Scratchy and I used to be buddies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha doesn’t say anything back— both of them know denying it would be lying because Señor Scratchy had, on more than one occasion, happily eaten celery on Rio’s lap as she scratched his back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio pulls out her laptop and starts typing into it not long after. It’s work, of course it’s work. Agatha doesn’t even have to look at the screen to know Rio’s typing a proposal for the plaintiff— a proposal that knowing Rio, would end up being agreed upon and it would close the case. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s a short flight. Short enough that she only manages to find five mistakes in her emails and curse on seven employees before they’re picking up their bags and making their way to “The Coven’s Neighborhood”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had lived in it her entire childhood. Everyone in the neighborhood knew each other. The same families in the neighborhood are the same families they’d run into in the market and in the town festivities. The daughters of those same families were Agatha’s classmates and friends. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ever since she was a child, Agatha had felt trapped in all of it, and she didn’t waste any time before she moved away. But every year, she had no choice but to come back for Halloween.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow,” Rio says, obvious amusement in her voice as she watches the Harkness’ over-the-top Halloween decorations. “This is…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like the devil threw up toys all over the front yard?” Agatha finishes for her, “Oh, I agree.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two story house looked exactly like it always does. Painted grey wood walls, the ceiling ending up on three big spikes and the black wood windows with white curtains covering up the inside of the house. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s a nice house, really. Modern enough on the inside. But her mother had kept the </span>
  <em>
    <span>old days Salem aesthetic</span>
  </em>
  <span>— just like her grandmother and great grandmother and so on. Evanora, at least, uses more vintage decorations than the rest of their neighbors. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead of bright orange pumpkins, there’s real carved ones that are rotting on the driveway. Instead of white as a sheet of paper skeletons on the driveway, there’s five skeletons' hands coming out of the grass— with bones realistic enough to get Agatha to wonder where she got them from. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s no fake white bed sheets ghost hanging from a tree anywhere in the garden, instead there’s a camouflaged enough projector hiding in the bushes that shows a </span>
  <em>
    <span>thing </span>
  </em>
  <span>moving from the back of the house to the trees. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In conclusion, kids are fucking terrified of their house— there’s no fake danger when they come to ask for candy. They get truly scared by the house, some people outside the coven’s neighborhood actually think it’s haunted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gets a kick every year from watching kids trying to be brave and knock on their door before </span>
  <em>
    <span>she </span>
  </em>
  <span>scares them to death. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha opens the front door and rolls her eyes when a recording of crappy Halloween music starts to play. She sighs in relief when it stops the moment she closes the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mother?” she asks, loudly, “I’m here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be right there!” Evanora screams from the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio is looking around curiously, her eyes taking the house in with the ferocity she does everything. She smirks at Agatha when their eyes connect. Agatha huffs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha, hello,” Evanora says, walking into the hall. She makes no movement to hug Agatha or give her a kiss on the cheek. “You must be the girlfriend,” she says, hiding her displeasure as much as she can. It doesn’t go past Rio because her smirk turns bigger at it. She extends her hand to Evanora.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pleasure,” she says and when Evanora’s hand is on hers, she continues, “Rio Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha has to bite down a laugh when her mother’s face goes from simple distrust to bright red anger. Evanora pulls her hand away quickly. “Vidal?” she spits out, “Not any relation to the Vidal company, I hope.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t bet on it,” Rio says, unbothered by Evanora’s distaste, as she places her hand on Agatha’s back, and takes a step closer to her, their bodies touching each other. “That’s daddy’s third child.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You brought a </span>
  <em>
    <span>Vidal </span>
  </em>
  <span>into </span>
  <em>
    <span>my </span>
  </em>
  <span>house?” Evanora yells, directly at Agatha. She flinches but only slightly, she knows it was subtle enough that no one noticed— no one ever notices. “And without telling me first?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you’d like to meet my girlfriend,” Agatha says, cheekily. The vein on her mother’s forehead is pulsing in the way it did every time Agatha got in trouble. Agatha suppresses a laugh. Oh, she sure gets a kick out of it. “But I get it. You didn’t expect someone so charming. It happens. The flight was </span>
  <em>
    <span>so </span>
  </em>
  <span>long though, we’re gonna go to sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulls Rio by the hand and climbs up the stairs into her room. There’s not much in it, really. Her mother had turned it into the guest room years ago— and turned the actual guest room into an office for herself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was never much she could have taken out, though. She had painted over Agatha’s black and purple walls with the same beige color of the rest of the house and the star signs bed covers were replaced by plain ones. All trinkets and books Agatha had and vaguely cared about had moved South with her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She sure is… a bitch,” Rio says, bluntly. Agatha snorts at it— she really shouldn’t have expected anything else from Rio. She’s never been one to walk on her tiptoes or not say what’s on her mind. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She really is,” Agatha says. She walks until she’s on the other side of the room, far away from Rio— and the distance is somehow both a relief and a curse. Rio is quiet, surprisingly so, and she’s looking at Agatha, curiously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you okay?” she asks, softer than she’s ever done before. “You flinched,” she explains, “I don’t know if it was because I touched you or…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, it wasn’t…” Agatha trails off, pursing her lips. She looks over at the bed— the king sized bed they’ll have to share. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span>. “I’m tired. I’m going to go take a shower.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha,” Rio says, stepping in front of the door. Her hands circle around Agatha’s wrists and the touch warms her insides. “We can talk, if you need to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to talk,” Agatha says, her eyes dropping to Rio’s lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We don’t have to, then,” Rio whispers, her eyes moving along Agatha’s face before finding her lips, too. “You’re too stressed, darling,” she says, low, “it’s been a while since someone’s taken care of you, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s fingers wrap themselves around one of Agatha’s loose strands of hair and move it away from her face, tucking it behind her ear. Agatha sighs and closes her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She knew, deep down, that inviting Rio would end up in this— they’ve never been too good at staying away from each other. Even when Agatha tries. Even when Agatha still hates her. Sort of. Sometimes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She takes Rio’s face between her hands and kisses her. Rio’s hands instantly grab her by the waist and pull her closer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They always end up here, one way or another, with Rio trying to get her moans low as Agatha leaves kisses and marks on her neck and pulls off her clothes. The suit jacket on the floor is quickly followed by Agatha’s sweater. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stumbles over her feet as she walks backwards into the bed and tries to get off her boots, her lips never leaving Rio’s. She falls into the bed and watches as Rio climbs on top of her, disheveled hair and red-bitten lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hands move under Agatha’s shirt as she climbs higher into the bed until she’s face to face with Agatha, her black strands of loose hair stroking the side of Agatha’s face. Agatha moans the second Rio’s hand finds her nipple— she bites her lip, trying to remain quiet, when she remembers where they are.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smirks— that annoying smirk of hers she always does when she thinks Agatha has finally given up control and would let her do whatever she wants. It’s not that kind of day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grabbing the back of her neck and kissing her deeply, Agatha’s free hand comes up to Rio’s back and flips them around on the bed. Rio lets out a huff before she’s chuckling, her hands tightening themselves on Agatha’s hair before pulling— hard enough to get Agatha to moan again, deep and loud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha's hands move under Rio’s shirt, slowly making their way down until they’re at the edges of her jeans— with easy familiarity, Rio knows to raise her hips so Agatha can pull them down and out of her, along with her thong. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With Rio half naked under her, Agatha’s mouth finds her thighs and starts leaving a trail of open kisses on it. She bites, softly, once, and Rio whimpers under her. She keeps on inching closer and closer to Rio’s lingerie but she never gets quite there. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha,” Rio breathes out, her hands tangling themselves on Agatha’s hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not yet,” she says, looking up to Rio, placing her hands over Rio’s hips to keep her in place. She bites down again, harder, and sucks on her thigh, feeling Rio’s hand tightening in her hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once she’s satisfied with the bruises she’s left on her thighs, she inches closer— Rio’s legs opening up more, instantly. Her legs circle Agatha’s shoulders, pulling her closer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha has to suppress her own moan once she gets a taste of Rio— she hates how much she’s missed this, missed her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio, on the other hand, has not made any noise restrictions on herself, even if she is moaning lower than she normally does. She’s gasping and moaning as Agatha finds a steady rhythm, winding her up more and more. She clenches her legs against Agatha’s head, her hips moving in sync with Agatha’s tongue. She’s moaning and saying things in between her breaths but her sounds are muffled by her thighs around Agatha’s ears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha looks up and takes sight of Rio, shaking and her mouth open in a gasp, her messy hair and one arm thrown over her head, her hand grasping into the pillow. She sweeps her mouth over Rio’s clit and slides two fingers deep inside of her, curling them in the exact way she knows will make Rio cry out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio does exactly that, she tenses under Agatha’s fingers and then she crumbles in the feeling of her, moaning loudly and arching her neck back. With a self satisfied smirk Agatha slowly pulls her fingers out of her and looks up— she’s seen Rio orgasm more times than she can count and yet there’s still an addictiveness to it she can’t shake away from her system. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slowly relaxing her legs, allowing Agatha to kneel on the bed, Rio smirks up to her then sighs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“God, I missed this,” she breathes out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The words instantly tense Agatha. </span>
  <em>
    <span>This </span>
  </em>
  <span>is not a thing. </span>
  <em>
    <span>This </span>
  </em>
  <span>is not like it used to be. </span>
  <em>
    <span>This </span>
  </em>
  <span>shouldn’t have happened. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This doesn't mean anything,” Agatha snaps, pulling away from Rio and getting off the bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes go big and she quickly sits on the bed. “I know, Agatha,” she says, slowly, one of her hands placing itself on the bed, inviting her to sit down, too. “I know. I just meant—”</span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m gonna go take that shower,” Agatha cuts her off, leaving the room, half her clothes off her body and the other half so crumpled it is obvious what she was doing, without giving Rio a chance to say anything back.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>She wants the taste of Rio out of her mouth. She wants the sensation of her fingers off of her skin. She wants the feeling in her heart out of her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stays in the shower long enough to get her heartbeat and her mind under control and yet when she walks into the room, Rio is sitting under the covers, book in hand, and obviously waiting for Agatha to return. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thought you’d be asleep by now,” Agatha mumbles, holding thigh to her towel. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could not give you that satisfaction,” Rio says, her eyes glued to Agatha’s legs. She smirks when Agatha doesn’t start to change, “Oh, come on, it’s nothing I haven’t seen before.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighs, turning her back to Rio and letting the towel drop. Rio whistles and Agatha glares at her, once she’s got her underwear on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You okay?” Rio asks, ignoring the glare. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>“You’re still a bad liar,” she says, snorting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you’re still an asshole.”</span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>“I gotta ask about… all this,” Rio says, moving her hand around and still carefully watching Agatha as she puts on her pajamas. “We never talked about any rules. Are we just winging it?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Since when do you care for rules?” Agatha asks, not looking at her, instead she distractedly puts on hand lotion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t but if I touch and you flinch—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“—that wasn’t because of you,” Aghata interrupts. “Not everything is about you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Rio says. “Still, flinching it’s not very relationship-like, is it?”</span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>“Then don’t touch me,” Agatha answers, easily. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what?” Rio snaps, “You act closeted here again. Your mother can pretend I’m just some random friend you brought. Isn’t the whole point that we annoy her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck,” Agatha lets out. “This was a mistake.”</span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>“It’s fun, though,” Rio says, annoying and self satisfied smirk on her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up,” Agatha says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Make me,” Rio fires back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just… be yourself, that’s annoying enough,” Agatha says, getting under the covers, “My mother will hate it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Rio nods, “Should I touch you then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s touch is a slippery slope, used to be and forever will be— she’ll light up the fire inside of Agatha. A thirst she never felt before that can only be quenched with Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Only when someone is doubting </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she answers eventually, pointing between them, “only </span>
  <em>
    <span>then</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about some pet names?” Rio says, sweetly and sarcastically, “What about Aggie? or </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ag</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will rip out your tongue if you ever call me that,” Agatha says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh, kinky,” Rio smirks at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up,” Agatha says, turning off her light and moving so that her back is all Rio can see. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>If there’s one thing Agatha and Rio have in common is that they’re both competitive. They win the pumpkin carving contest with such ease— Rio and the little knife she always carries around do most of the work while Agatha gives her instructions— that it catched everyone off guard. It’s sort of tradition to walk around the neighborhood after and look at the rest of the pumpkins. Agatha usually does it with her mother but today she had left the house before Agatha and Rio had gotten up so now it was just them walking side by side on the streets.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha! Hi!” Alice says, walking over to them, Jeniffer beside her. Agatha has to suppress a groan.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alice, Jen,” Agatha greets, placing her hand on Rio’s arms in what she hopes is a relationship-like touch. “This is Rio,” she says, then adds, carefully, “my girlfriend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They don’t try to hide their surprise and their eyes instantly go to Rio, now filled with interest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha’s girlfriend, huh?” Jen asks, smirking. There’s a sultriness in her voice and an appreciation in her eyes as they roam over Rio that Agatha knows exactly what it means— the jealousy sits uncomfortably in the back of her throat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s not the first time she’s felt jealous about Rio— there was always some sort of possessiveness when women would shamelessly start to flirt with Rio, even if she never flirts back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I’m Rio,” she says, waving her hand but making no movement to shake their hands nor to move away from Agatha’s touch, and instead, she leans into it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hi,” Alice says, less interested in Rio’s looks and more interested in watching how close they are standing next to each other. “So, how did you two meet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We work together,” Agatha answers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And how did you get Agatha to actually like you?” Jen asks, chuckling at her own joke and watching Rio curiously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Easily,” Rio says, smirking proudly, “I’m irresistible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolls her eyes, “And so humble, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha doesn't like anyone,” Jen says, curiously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, she used to like Wanda,” Alice adds, sharing a smirk with Jen. Agatha sighs when she sees the curiosity in Rio’s eyes and she pulls her hand away from her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wanda?” Rio asks, “Who's Wanda?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The cute redhead over there, with the twins,” Jen says, pointing towards the corner of the streets, where Wanda is talking to her boys. They’re looking up to her, serious expressions on their faces and nodding quickly before running off. She can almost feel the questions radiating off of Rio as she watches them and her eyes move to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, that's enough,” Agatha says, putting a stop to the conversation. “Gossip is for lowlives, didn’t you know that, Jen?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jen looks unsurprised at her remark and snorts. “See you around, Agatha,” she says, before taking Alice’s hand and walking away. Alice offers them a small smile before she’s dragged away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So what?” Rio asks as they start walking again, she looks around the neighborhood with intrigue. Agatha can tell she’s trying to remain cool about it but she can still hear the subtle annoyance in her voice. “She's like your ex?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Agatha answers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what?” Rio snaps, not even hiding the irritation in her voice now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffs, stopping in her tracks and turning towards her. “Are you actually jealous right now?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Rio says, defensive. “I’m just curious.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you?” Agatha taunts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I'm just playing the part of the girlfriend,” Rio shoots back then rolls her eyes. “It’s not like you’ve done much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s no one with us right now,” Agatha yell-whispers, “who cares?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your friends are still watching us, you know,” Rio says, her eyes subtly making their way behind Agatha’s back. She doesn’t need to turn around to know Alice and Jen must be watching their sort-of-fight like hawks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine, Agatha sighs, putting her arm around Rio’s waist and pulling her closer before she places a kiss on her cheek. She tries not to think about how the reason it feels so natural is because she’s done that same thing multiple times before. “She just used to be my friend,” Agatha explains. “A long long long time ago. And then we had a falling out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That wasn't so hard, was it?” Rio says, chuckling and placing a kiss on Agatha’s jaw.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck off,” she answers. Yet she makes no movement to evade Rio’s kiss nor to wipe away the smirk on her face.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Agatha can’t focus on the words in front of her. Under normal circumstances, the mail would have been written and sent minutes ago— long forgotten from her mind as she wrote the next. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But this isn’t normal circumstances— at least, not now.  When they had returned to the house, going straight to Agatha’s room in an attempt to ignore her mother until at least dinner, Rio had easily stepped off of her clothes and walked into the bathroom in her underwear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had left the door completely open and started the shower. An obvious and clear wordless invitation— one they had developed after months of being together, spending nights and mornings and afternoons in each other’s apartments. Two years ago, Rio’s actions would have been pretty normal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha wasn’t going to walk in. She really wasn’t. That’s why she grabbed her laptop and got to work. But just thinking about Rio’s tan skin under the shower made her mouth water. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taking off her own clothes, she walks into the bathroom and slowly closes the door behind her. She walks, surely, and slowly pulls the curtain until Rio’s back is in her view. She knows Rio heard her, noticed her, yet she doesn’t move from her place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s lips find Rio’s shoulder and Rio moans softly at the touch. “So much for not wanting me,” she whispers. Agatha presses their bodies closer together, her hands moving along Rio’s skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You left the door open,” Agatha says, moving up to Rio’s neck and kissing her there. “I know what that means, </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>know what that means.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You haven’t forgotten then?” Rio asks, moaning louder this time when Agatha’s teeth bite into her skin. She’s not entirely sure what she’s asking. Has she forgotten their rules? Has she forgotten their nights together? Has she forgotten </span>
  <em>
    <span>them</span>
  </em>
  <span>?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Agatha answers anyway because even if she wanted to, she hasn’t forgotten a single thing that has to do with Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turns around and pushes her front against Agatha’s then kisses her hard and with so much intensity it leaves Agatha breathless. Agatha feels her knees go weak when Rio’s hands move along her body until they reach her breast— her nipples harden under Rio’s touch and she moans, spreading her legs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The desire that’s been building up inside of Agatha is overflowing. She feels intoxicated with Rio ever since she tasted her again and she feels restless to not having been touched in return last night. She spent months trying to find an adequate substitute for Rio’s touch and now she knows, as those same fingers she thought about when touching herself, just couldn’t be compared. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>One of Rio’s hands is playing with her nipple while the other is holding onto Agatha’s waist, hard and aching in a way Agatha knows will leave a mark, as if she’s scared Agatha will go away soon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha takes a fist of Rio’s hair and takes her head out of the crook of her neck, where Rio was biting and licking. Their eyes meet and Agatha has to swallow when she sees the longing in Rio’s eyes so clearly. “Fuck me,” she says, as she takes Rio’s hand in hers and pushes it down. “I need you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s fingers slip inside her and Agatha moans, holding onto Rio as water falls on top of them. She mindlessly reaches for the valve and turns off the water and Rio uses the movement to press Agatha to the wall, one hand helping her maintain her equilibrium as the other has her fingers buried inside of Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“More.” Agatha moans and she bites down on Rio’s shoulder when she adds a third finger into her, burying them deeper with each thrust. Rio’s mouth is on hers again, desperate and needy and rough in the way Agatha loves so much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha feels her orgasm building but she needs Rio’s tongue on her so she pulls at Rio’s hair and separates their mouths and pushes down. Rio gets on her knees instantly and starts to lick her clit, her fingers still fucking Agatha with vigor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The tension in her body increases and she leans her head against the cold damp wall and moans again when Rio sucks on her clit and she’s coming undone, her hands tightening and then relaxing on Rio’s hair as a satisfying warmth fills her body. Rio stands up and kisses her again and she whimpers when Agatha’s fingers touch her center.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She thrusts her fingers into Rio hard and fast, harder and faster. “You love this, don’t you?” Agatha whispers, her hand holding Rio up when she curls one of her legs around Agatha so she can thrust her fingers deeper. “Don’t you wish it was my purple strap instead of my fingers inside of you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, yes,” Rio moans, eyes closed and neck exposed to Agatha. She bites on it again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck, I wish I was fucking you with the strap right now,” she whispers on the crook of her neck, “You on all fours, all pretty and wet for me, baby. I’d make you beg for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio screams when she orgasms, her legs shaking. Agatha keeps her fingers inside of her until Rio lowers her leg and kisses Agatha again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I still have to shower,” Rio whispers, her lips still touching Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Agatha says, using her thumb to move away one of Rio’s strands of hair from her face. She presses her wet fingers to Rio’s bottom lip and she opens her mouth automatically, Agatha grins. “Me, too.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Evanora Harkness is a complicated woman. Always has been. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In many ways, she hates her daughter. It’s not really a well covered up secret, Agatha has known so since she was a child— one of the big reasons she was always lashing out and leaving the house. If her mother was going to hate her, she might as well give her a good reason. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But in many ways, she’s a woman of tradition. A woman of good heritage. And she lives by that. And so, that means never kicking out her daughter, no matter how much she wants to. That means, even when both of them hated it, seeing her daughter at least once a year.  That means accepting, even with discomfort and disdain, her daughter’s lesbianism so that the town would not think less of her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But apparently, no matter how well or fake-well her mother took her sexuality, bringing someone from the Vidal family was a step too far. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harpies, all of them!” Her mother screams, finishing her five minute rant about Rio’s uncles, completely ignoring each time Agatha had tried to stop her or turn the conversation towards something else. So far, Rio had looked somewhere in between of annoyment and amusement. She doesn’t really deny most of her family’s misgivings, she even hates her odd cousin here and there. “I guess I should not be surprised you’re moving in those circles, Agatha, you have always been rotten to the core.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet, it's </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>that seems enough to turn Rio’s annoyance into outright anger, she slams her hand on the dinner table, the plates shake and the glass in front of Evanora falls and spills the wine over the white tablecloth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s enough,” she says, her voice low and dangerous. “I quite frankly don’t give a shit about how you speak about my family but you cannot talk to Agatha like that. She’s your daughter!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, kid,” Evanora says, barely looking at Rio as she speaks. “You barely know Agatha to be defending her at all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know Agatha,” Rio snaps. “I know her more than you do. And that’s exactly why I love her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha goes still, hand frozen in the space between her and Rio’s arm, where she was going to place a relaxing hand to stop the argument. To </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Evanora looks up and watches Rio curiously but before she can say anything, Agatha stands up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re leaving,” she says, moving away from her chair and the unfinished meal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She isn’t sure if it’s her mother or Rio that says her name but she’s not looking at them, she’s not paying attention to them at all. Her heart is beating uncomfortably on her chest and she just has to leave. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Leave. Leave. Leave</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re leaving,” she repeats. “Pack your bags, Rio, we won’t be where we’re not wanted.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Evanora doesn’t try to stop them when they leave, slamming the front door and without saying goodbye. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha quietly and angrily changes their plane tickets to one that leaves in three hours and ignores Rio’s presence the entire time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they get to the airport, it’s late. Late enough for most of the shops to be closed as well as the bars. There’s only a few people walking around, stretching their legs before taking their flight. Agatha and Rio sit down, two seats between them, in front of their gate and wait.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want to talk about it?” Rio asks, eventually, when the silence and the boredom finally get to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Rio sighs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why would you </span>
  <em>
    <span>say </span>
  </em>
  <span>that?” Agatha snaps, instantly, turning towards Rio and allowing her to see the anger in her eyes for the first time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Say what?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffs, “</span>
  <em>
    <span>That</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Why would you say that you—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha doesn’t finish her sentence. Rio looks away, lets her eyes roam over the almost empty airport even when all they wanna do is look at Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don't have to take it seriously if you don’t want to,” she says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But was it serious?” Agatha asks, quietly, so quietly Rio almost didn’t hear it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know it was,” Rio says, “It is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha doesn’t say anything back. Rio sighs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They don’t share a word on the plane either.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Jac, hey, can you tell Vidal to send a copy of her draft deal to my office?” Agatha says on Monday when the elevator doors open to her floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thankfully, she hadn’t found Rio in the elevator, she needed a few more moments to breathe. She hadn’t seen her since the airport, where they had stiffly said goodbye and taken separate taxis back to their apartments. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No can do,” she says. “You’re going solo on this one, Vidal is out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What? Why?” Agatha asks, confused but Jac wasn’t paying attention to her anymore, she was walking away and speaking to someone on the phone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio doesn’t come to work that morning. And the annoyance that was simmering on Agatha’s chest becomes anger by lunchtime so, for the first time in years, she walks out of her office during lunch and heads to Rio’s place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shifts uncomfortably when the doorman remembers her and lets her in with no troubles but she ignores that feeling for a second and uses her anger to loudly bang on Rio’s door. She opens it and Agatha is graced with a view she hasn’t seen in ages— Rio, in an oversized t-shirt that used to belong to Agatha, barren legs and a spoon in her hand.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing?” Agatha asks, enraged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mac and cheese,” Rio answers, smirking because she knows that’s not what Agatha means. “Want some?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffs, pushing past Rio and walking into the apartment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure, come on in, Agatha,” Rio says, sarcastically as she closes the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why aren’t you in the Stark case anymore?” Agatha asks, crossing her arms. </span>

  <span>Agatha is standing in the middle of the dining room and she watches as Rio walks into the kitchen, leaves the spoon on the counter and turns off the stove. She leans her hands on the kitchen island that separates the two spaces, subtly putting a wall and more space between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I took up the Pym case,” she says, “too many meetings would overlap.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bullshit,” Agatha rolls her eyes. “You could work multiple cases at the same time in your sleep. You’ve done so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, maybe I just don't want to see you?” she snaps at her, she doesn’t raise her voice but she throws her arms in the air in exasperation. “Ever thought about that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not?” Agatha exclaims, walking closer to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re the one who didn’t want to see me, remember?” Rio says, taking a step into Agatha’s space. “I’m giving you exactly what you want!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Space is not what I want!” Agatha yells, breathing heavily. Rio is so close she can smell her perfume on her hair and the coffee on her breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck </span>
  </em>
  <span>is it?” Rio yells back and Agatha leans in and kisses her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pushes Rio until her back hits the counter, her lips never leaving hers. She takes Rio’s face in her hands and kisses her like she’s never kissed her before— slowly, full of want and full of something else she doesn’t want to name but knows Rio </span>
  <em>
    <span>knows </span>
  </em>
  <span>exactly what it is. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio moans into the kiss, her hands moving from Agatha’s body to her cheeks, pulling her closer even when it’s not possible anymore. “Fuck, Agatha,” Rio moans when Agatha pulls their lips apart and her lips find Rio’s pulsepoint. “Bedroom,” she whispers, taking Agatha’s blazer off her shoulder, dropping it to the floor and starting to pull at her white shirt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stumble into the bed in a coordinated mess. Agatha loses her shoes halfway through the hallway and her shirt is completely unbuttoned by the time she climbs on top of Rio on the bed. Rio bites her lips and places her hands on top of Agatha’s breast, one of them moves under the bra and starts playing with her nipple— Agatha moans, arching her back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where is it?” She asks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Same place,” Rio says, knowing exactly what she’s talking about. Agatha walks out of the bed and opens the third drawer and with ease puts on the strap-on and starts to rub some lube into it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes are filled with want and desire, she takes a fist of her shirt and starts to take it off. Agatha quickly grabs her wrist and stops her. She takes both of Rio’s hands and places them over her head. “You think I didn’t notice this shirt is mine?” Agatha asks, tightening her hold on Rio’s wrist. “You look so pretty in it, baby. I’m going to fuck you with you in it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha lines up the strap, one hand keeping hold of Rio’s, and slowly pushes into her and starts to move in deep thrusts. Rio, knowing she's at her own place, takes the liberty to be as loud as she usually is and the noise turns Agatha on more and more. She starts to pick up her pace, her hand moving away from Rio’s wrist and moving under her shirt until she’s touching her breast. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha—” Rio is mumbling her name, moaning and whimpering with each thrust and Agatha knows she’s close. She kisses her— the kiss only lasts a second before Rio is gasping again and Agatha’s lip finds her neck instead and lets her hand find Rio’s clit— biting and touching at the same time, getting an even louder moan from Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio comes not longer after, her eyes rolling to the back of her head, her legs shaking around Agatha as she rides out her orgasm. Agatha doesn’t stop, instead she keeps fucking into Rio, the pressure in her own clit having built up and she’s so so so close. She thrust into Rio until she’s letting out a low, deep moan and coming under on top of her. Rio kisses her then, swallowing the last of Agatha’s moan. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck,” Rio breathes out as Agatha pulls out of her and takes off the strap-on. “I missed this,” she says and then goes uncomfortably quiet when she realizes what she has said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorts and rolls her eyes at her, throwing herself on the bed beside Rio, her hand finding Rio’s arm softly. “I missed you, too,” Agatha says, quietly. Rio smiles.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Why did you take that case from me?” Agatha asks, eventually. She needs to know. She has to know. It’s night time, they’re lying in bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had never once called her work to tell them she wasn’t coming back for the rest of the day but today, she did— just to spend the rest of the day with Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio is lying on her stomach, her back bare to Agatha, whose fingers slowly trace the scratches she had left on her back. Rio’s eyes are close and she has a content smile on her face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re still mad about it?” Rio asks, opening her eyes and watching Agatha closely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Agatha answers, pursing her lips. “That case would have jump-started my career, instead I had to wait two more years. All that and you lost the case anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You would have lost it, too,” Rio sighs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I wouldn't have.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, you would have,” Rio says, firmly. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Anyone</span>
  </em>
  <span> would have lost it. The case was paid and closed before the lawyers were chosen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The confidence in Rio's voice makes her pause. Rio might be a liar to a lot of people but if there’s one thing Agatha is sure of is that Rio has never outright lied to </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How did you know that?” Agatha asks, carefully.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father might have… discouraged me from taking the case,” Rio says.“I know what that means.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you… took it anyway?” Agatha asks, “Instead of me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I knew my reputation wasn’t gonna be undone by it. But for a brand new lawyer…” Rio trails off and Agatha’s hand stops moving. Rio sighs. “I guess I wouldn’t have done it for </span>
  <em>
    <span>any </span>
  </em>
  <span>lawyer. I just did it for you, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallows and there’s a sudden burn in her eyes that she blinks away. She presses a kiss to Rio’s shoulder. “Thank you,” she whispers, sincerely yet a bit uncomfortable. Rio nods in answer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’re not exactly the same that they were before, there’s a pause of uncertainty each time they’re about to do something they used to do before. But they push through it and pretend the doubt isn’t there at all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, the next morning, when Rio slowly hands Agatha a black coffee, Agatha pretends there’s no doubt in Rio’s eyes. And when Agatha takes the cup, Rio pretends Agatha didn’t freeze for a second before grabbing it and sitting down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do the case with me,” Agatha says, after taking a few sips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Rio answers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm trying to be nice here,” Agatha groans, “Throwing a stupid olive branch or whatever.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckles, “No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not?” Agatha asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I still don’t want to work with you, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, come on, you love it,” Agatha says, her voice low and deep, as she gets up from her chair and walks around the table, sitting down on it, right in front of Rio— her kimono slightly opening at the action. Rio bites her bottom lip. “The energy, the tension, the anticipation to know just how </span>
  <em>
    <span>good </span>
  </em>
  <span>we are together,” Agatha places a finger under Rio’s chin and makes her look up, “Don’t you wanna do it again?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what do I get out of it?” Rio asks, smirking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anything you want,” Agatha whispers as Rio’s hand finds her naked thigh and starts to make its way up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anything?” Rio says, “I have a few ideas.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I bet you do.”</span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>“I’m not sure you’ll be a fan of it,” Rio says, more seriously, her fingers still moving and leaving goosebumps all along Agatha’s skin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really?” Agatha hums, “What is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Next year, when you go to Salem, I’m going with you,” Rio says, slowly, “As your real girlfriend, this time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha lets out a short laugh then smiles down at Rio. “Fine,” she says, “but then I’m not going to be nice and let you take control of the case, I’m in charge.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, honey,” Rio says, smirking, “if you want to be in control, you can be."</span>
  <span>
    <br />
