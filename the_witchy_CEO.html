      Chapter 1: coffee, cappuccino
  </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>How did Rio even end up in <em>that</em> place? </p><p>Working in a café; making coffees and occasionally juices that had no flavour in them because the fruits were either gone bad, or from shady supermarkets.</p><p>She remembered how she used to be in college, how easily she had become <em>valedictorian</em>. Perhaps, a little too easy. Because, for her, studying wasn't a problem; it was very intuitive, and probably the easiest thing to do. She had a great memory, and an infuriating way with her words that always left the professors astonished.</p><p>Growing up, Rio realised how intelligent she was, not only because the adults around her always told her that, saying that she was a little annoying '<em>genius</em>', but also because she thought of herself as above the others.</p><p>But, quickly, as the time went by, as she reached adulthood, that grandiose vision she had of herself had faded away. With college over, what else was there? She had taken a degree in economics, she had sent her CV to a vast number of companies but not a single one had replied. Which made Rio's blood boil. Why was the world of adults so complicated?</p><p>And, there she was, at the ripe age of twenty-six, working in a café, wasting her time as she watched all of her classmates go on with their lives, she even thought of deleting her social media because she didn't want to see the faces of those who had succeeded in life. She was tired.</p><p>It was thanks to Alice that she had found her job as a barista. Without her, she probably would've ended up poor, or stealing from rich people, sorta of <em>Robin Hood</em> (she really wasn't, probably would've ended up spending the money she had stolen, instead of giving them to the poor).</p><p>And, also, thanks to Alice, she had a place to live. Because, well, she was her roommate, and they shared an apartment. To sum it up, Alice had saved Rio's <em>ass</em>, and she had adopted her.</p><p>So, the least she could do was helping her with her café. She didn't mind it.</p><p>That day had been chaotic. Perverted men flirting with her, throwing random jokes to which Rio (sadly) had to force a smile. Children who were scared of her intimidating aura, and would hide themselves behind her mother to which, again, Rio had forced to smile at. But it wasn't all bad, because, sometimes, she would flirt with hot women and they would exchange compliments until one of them had to leave, only to come back days later, with the courage to ask for her number and spend the night afterwards. It wasn't all bad, but it could be better.</p><p>The day was about to end, and soon, the café would've closed. It was Rio's favourite time of her work hours, because she could play on her phone, as she waited for her turn to be over, without being disturbed because, who would've wanted a coffee before dinner? It was around 7'15 p.m. when Alice walked out of the kitchen, closing the door behind her, as she walked towards Rio.</p><p>"Rio, have you forgotten about tonight's hangout?" Alice asked, fearing her answer. Sure, Rio's memory was great, the best, but when it came to personal matters, it sucked.</p><p>"Yeah, around 8'30 at the ol' bar, like always." Rio replied, while she pressed her finger on the screen of her phone. Poor phone, if it could talk, it would've begged Rio to stop pressing so hard. But Rio was serious when it came to games, especially this one, which was her favourite.</p><p>"Wow–, so you can think when you're on that little game of yours."</p><p>'Alice, this <em>isn't</em> a game. I'm trying to get my favourite character of all times, I've been trying since the game came out. I need to focus, so" she licked her lips, meaning she was really, <em>really</em> focused, "I need to concentrate! You know that."</p><p>Alice sighed, then rolled her eyes. "Fine, you're on closing duty today. Be sure to close the doors properly. Closing time is 7'30, only ten minutes. So, behave and don't get distracted by that game. I'll see you at the bar."</p><p>Rio nodded her head, as she did not remove her eyes from the screen. After all, what would've happened in ten minutes? Why was she worrying so much? Sometimes, she really thought she needed a vacation. Desperately. Once Alice was out, Rio only had to wait. Minutes after minutes, seconds after seconds, the time seemed to <em>never</em> end.</p><p>Until, someone had entered the bar. It was impossible not to notice when people came in because, as stupid as it may sound, Alice had placed a little bell above the door. She found it irritating, but Alice found it hilarious.</p><p>Rio still didn't remove her eyes from the screen. She sighed, only to speak with the most calmest, passive–aggressive voice she had learned to use for these inconveniences.</p><p>"We're closed. Sorry," she wasn't sorry, like, at <em>all</em>. But she had to pretend she was.</p><p>The stranger hesitated to answer, perhaps giving up hopes of getting something tasty before going back home. But no, that wasn't the case.</p><p>"The lights are still on," her voice was strict, severe yet soothing and comforting. And yet, Rio had not even glanced at her. She just sighed without even trying to hide how bored she was. If Alice were there, she would've gotten a punch on her head. But, luckily, she wasn't there.</p><p>"They indeed are, but we're about to close."</p><p>The mysterious woman walked closer to the counter. Her eyes scanned Rio's figure, and she could feel them on her since it wasn't the first time someone had stared at her, so hard, so angry, she knew that what she said made her upset. But, either way, she didn't remove her eyes from the screen.</p><p>"Are you saying that because so that you can stay on your phone, without having to do one, <em>little</em> task?!" She raised her voice, which sent shivers to Rio's back. For the first time, she was scared of a customer.</p><p>It was now that Rio had lifted her head to stare at her, and oh, she wished to have done it sooner. She was tall, taller than her, with rigid lineaments of the face that made her seem mature. Rio focused on her lips that were painted in red by a lipstick (what kind of lipstick paints lips so well?), and on her eyes that were blue, azzurine, resembling the sky, there was a little grey in them, which made her think of little clouds. The woman wore a suit, with a black tie, and her hair were in a tight, high ponytail. Women in suit,<em> her weakness</em>.</p><p>'<strong>Game Over</strong>', the little sound came from Rio's phone, which made Rio want to disappear. Not only she had lost her focus, but she had also ignore a hottie like her? She was ashamed.</p><p>"Dang, I lost," she managed to say, breaking the thick tension that the older woman had made. She was sad, but also very aware of what she had to face now. A troublesome customer.</p><p>"Kids <em>these</em> days..."</p><p>Rio smiled, fearing that if she had added a comment on the most boomer thing she had ever heard, she would've found a negative review on both her page, and on the cafe's page. So, she smiled.</p><p>She had to gain forgiveness, so, she would've done what she had to do. Quickly, as the time she had left wasn't much.</p><p>"Uh–," Rio stared at her, and the woman didn't say a word, it was Rio's duty to break the silence, "so, what will you have, ma'am?"</p><p>"Finally. Took you long enough."</p><p>Rio tried hard not to flip her off, she really did.</p><p>"I'll have a cappuccino."</p><p>"Take away, correct?"</p><p>"Obviously, I don't intend on staying in this God's <em>forgotten</em> café any longer," she replied, as she crossed her arms. Rio didn't reply, what was there to say? She simply smiled, per usual, and turned around to prepare the order.</p><p>Her movements were fast, she had made many cappuccinos in her life, knowing the recipe by heart. A minute had passed, as she turned around, with the plastic glass on her hand as she poured the drink in it. And the woman simply observed, without saying anything. Was she shy? Not that she minded.</p><p>As she was about to grab the drink, Rio had stopped her. "<em>Wait</em>," she had told her, as she took a machine that she would use to make shapes on the coffee's surface. It was fun. She always tried new shapes, but she failed every time.</p><p>"Here, I made a heart," Rio proudly said, while the other woman looked at her in a weird, hesitant way. The shape resembled the one of the heart, but it was far from looking like one.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"I like it," there was no particular reason. Sure, she had been very rude to her, and she was acting very hostile in her regards. But, she could see softeness in her eyes, and being nice wasn't something too complicated.</p><p>"It doesn't look like a heart."</p><p>Ok, <em>forget</em> about being nice. She was just rude. But, nevertheless, Rio kept a smile on, a warm smile.</p><p>"I know," she laughed, "I tried doing other shapes, spirals, circles... But hearts are the only ones I don't mess up that badly." She kept on rambling, what may have sounded like hieroglyphs to her ears. "I tried doing kittens shapes once," continued, "but it looked like a failed experiment from Area 51. Never did it again."</p><p>The woman didn't reply, and Rio started regretting saying all of that. Especially to someone who didn't even care about shapes, coffees, and else. But, surprisingly, on the older woman's lips appeared a smile, then she heard a soft, quiet laugh. Rio stared at her, not sure if she was imagining it, or if it was really happening. She was happy to have made her laugh, to have made her forget about her problems for a while.</p><p>"You're weird." She managed to say, after quickly returning to her serious, strict self. The switch–up was crazy. She had never seen such controlled actions.</p><p>"Yeah, well," Rio handed the coffee to her, "I think you gotta be a little weird to do this job. You really see all the faces of the world."</p><p>The woman took a sip, and Rio could've swore to have seen a slight change in her eyes, as they were more relaxed. It brought satisfaction to her.</p><p>"Is it good?" A question was posed. She had asked that question many times, and the answers were always different, always positive.</p><p>"Could be better."</p><p>Rio struggled to keep the smile.</p><p>"But–," the woman added, after taking another sip, "it's better than the one they serve at my company, so it's a start, I guess."</p><p>She was happy, her smile widening as she heard that. "Well, I did practice a lot."</p><p>There was a moment of silence, and Rio wanted to say more, to ask so many unanswered questions. She had so many doubts and curiosities, and she could've swore that she had never felt that curious about a client before.</p><p>"So–," there was something going on, was that awkwardness? No, she never felt shy around people, but then, why did she feel as if her whole world would crumble if she had said the wrong thing? "How was–, work?" She sucked at small talks.</p><p>The woman stared at the watch on her wrist and then at Rio. "Thank you for the coffee," her gaze lingered on the name target, "R–Rio? Thank you." She then held the coffee tightly and walked out.</p><p>Rio was alone, again. She sighed. "How does one mess it up so bad?" Murmured to herself, as she proceeded to recompose her mind, avoiding thinking of what had just happened. She proceeded to close the café, turning off the lights, the machines, and then, she rushed to meet up with friends.</p><p>—</p><p>"So—, I did ask her out. But she told me she wasn't sure she liked girls," Jen was lively that night, than she had ever been, perhaps due to her recent heartbreak, "I said, no–huh, you won't fool me again. And I walked away!"</p><p>Everyone (Alice and Billy) gasped, but not Rio, who was too busy drowning herself into her glass of beer, a strong beer. Oh, how she wished to forget what had happened just a few hours ago.</p><p>Billy had noticed something wrong with Rio, and finally, he took the courage to ask (even if he was as scared as a pup), "Rio, are you okay? You seem quiet, what's on your mind?"</p><p>Suddenly, everyone's eyes were on her.</p><p>"Billy–, just because you are <em>graduating</em> in psychology doesn't mean you can psychoanalyse everyone."</p><p>Alice stared at Billy, whose lips were slightly parted. He was about to say something but preferred not to at the last moment. It was Jen who took the lead.</p><p>"Is our Rio experiencing troubles with girls?"</p><p>Alice's gaze was on Jen now, and Rio's eyes lifted up from the beer.</p><p>"Me? Nah, never–," she laughed, "I just had a very awkward encounter with a woman. I tried talking to her, but she shut me down. Quickly, it kinda hurt."</p><p>"Wow, reminds me of my boss!" Jen tried to make her friends laugh, and Alice attempted a smile, but she was obviously worried about her.</p><p>"Yeah–, but I'll recover. But, enough of me," Rio grabbed the beer, to take a sip, "how's the new job going, Jen?"</p><p>Rio tried hard to establish a joyful atmosphere, and it worked. Aside from Alice constantly side–eyeing her, so was Billy.</p><p>"Terrible, my boss–, ugh–, I swear, sometimes I think she enjoys seeing <em>chaos</em> around her. My coworkers call her with terrible names. Today, she stormed out of her office because the barista had mistaken her order, and she rushed to a nearby café! She sure knows how to throw tantrums..."</p><p>Alice listened carefully, but Rio, something snapped in her. Could she be? No, what were those theories? Stupid.</p><p>"If I remember correctly," Billy joined, "your boss is the infamous Agatha Harkness? Right?"</p><p>"Yeah, she's a big shot. She's one of the most important CEOs of the city, if not country."</p><p>Rio laughed, "I never heard of her, bet she's a loser, I bet she's an old hag!"</p><p>"Not quite," Alice added, as she stared at her, "I think she's really pretty, actually."</p><p>"Oh God, you too, Alice? Am I really the only one who hasn't seen this woman? Like, ever?"</p><p>Jen smiled as she went through her phone, searching for something. "<em>Bingo</em>," she then said. She turned her phone to let Rio see, and she could've swore that she had seen Rio's smile turn upside down.</p><p>The same woman who she had served that evening was Agatha Harkness? What a twisted joke. Rio had to control her facial expressions, but it was too late, everyone had noticed. Everyone.</p><p>"Rio?" Billy was the first one to call her out.</p><p>She laughed, hysterically. "See? A total hag!"</p><p>"And here I thought she was your type–," Jen teased, which made Rio's blood rise at such a high speed.</p><p>"Whaaat? Nah–, I'm not into old hags."</p><p>Alice, Jen, heck even Billy knew it wasn't true. But, they all simultaneously decided to drop whatever was there, as they continued to talk to one another.</p><p>'<em>Agatha Harkness</em>', Rio thought as she tried to remember her name, begging the alcohol to not wipe it away from her memories. It would've worked, she hoped that.</p>

<p>Rio <em>never</em> had been the social type. She sometimes posted stories, occasionally posts or reels, but nothing more. She used it for stalking, which she believed was the true essence of socials. So, when the morning after she had found herself on Agatha Harkness' profile, on her Instagram (it wasn't hard to find, at all, which made Rio feel like some sorta of hacker), she couldn't help but scroll through her posts.</p><p>There were many photos. Cats, plants, cooking? It was so weird. She was more social than her. She had found pictures of her company (Jen's workplace) and of a <em>kid</em>, who had the same eyes as hers, perhaps her kid. Which meant that she was married, and she probably had to stop doing whatever she was doing. She would've forgotten about her.</p><p>As she was about to log off, she noticed she had done something she wouldn't have wished upon no one, not even on her worst enemy; she had, accidentally, <em>followed</em> her. Panic rose inside her, she quickly went to unfollow her, she then tossed the phone on the nearby sofa and dressed up, trying to uncool.</p><p>—</p><p>The day had only started, and Rio wanted to die already. She tried to forget the shameful thing she had done earlier, saying to herself motivational stuff, and it worked, somehow.</p><p>There were many clients, Alice was serving them at the tables. Until, she had stepped in, Agatha. Oh God, no, no, Rio bit her lip as she tried to not scream. Whatever, she probably didn't know how to see who had asked to follow her. Yes, that was it.</p><p>Agatha's gaze met hers, and Rio avoided looking at her. Alice had noticed the dominating presence, and immediately ran to greet that estimated guest, and Agatha, in return, coldly even returned the greeting. She just stared at Rio, and Rio pretended not to notice. Playing dumb, acting as if she was invisible.</p><p>The real problem began when Agatha walked towards her. "<em>Oh Lord, I know I haven't been your purest sheep, but please, give me strength</em>," Rio whispered to herself, some old and childish thing she used to say whenever she was in trouble, deep shit.</p><p>Agatha stood in front of her, eyes severe.</p><p>Rio coughed, but she knew it wasn't enough, so she smiled, but even that didn't seem to work. So, she reciprocated the stare, and waited for her words.</p><p>"Well? Aren't you going to ask what I want?" She asked, arching her eyebrow in a disapproving look. Oh, it wasn't so bad.</p><p>"Cappuccino?" Rio remember, which meant two things: she was scared or incredibly aroused. Or perhaps, both of them. Alice had returned to her work, so she was alone with this one.</p><p>"No, black coffee."</p><p>"Oh! Are you trying something new today?"</p><p>Agatha didn't answer, and Rio murmed a low '<em>okay</em>' as she went on to prepare the coffee. 'Black coffee', she hadn't done that order in a while. But she quickly did it, hoping nothing else would be said.</p><p>Unfortunately for her, that wasn't the case.</p><p>"So," it was the first time Agatha had spoken to her, Rio felt incredibly tense, her demise was near. "Do you usually follow your customers on social media?"</p><p>Rio's cheeks began to turn slightly red, as she was even embarrassed to remember that. She stopped for a while. What now? What would've happened? She turned around, handing the coffee to her. "Here."</p><p>"You didn't answer."</p><p>She hated being caught, especially when those blue, icy eyes were so focused on her. She thought she would've melted on the spot.</p><p>"It'd be wiser for you to answer my question," she took the cup in her hands, without ever interrupting the eye–contact, "unless, of course, you want the <em>authorities</em> to get involved."</p><p>Rio's eyes widened. She could feel herself almost laughing at what Agatha had just said, and she tried her best to keep her composure. If the police had been involved every time Rio had checked girls on their socials, she would be in jail, rotting in a cell.</p><p>But Agatha had noticed how she tried to not laugh at her, which made her feel infuriating things. "Why are you laughing? You think I won't?"</p><p>"No, no–, I think you're very capable of that," Rio smiled, which was enough to make a vein appear on Agatha's temple, "but, the <em>police</em>? I mean, what would you tell them? 'This barista followed me on Instagram, but she then removed the follow! Please, arrest her'!" And then, as she couldn't contain the laughters any longer, she proceeded to laugh loudly.</p><p>Alice turned around, with an <em>enigmatic</em> look on her face, probably already seeing the ending of her activity before her eyes.</p><p>On the other hand, Agatha's face was of a complete deep–red colour. She didn't reply quickly, as Rio initially thought, she took deep–breaths in and out, in and out. Then, after minutes of silence, she got closer to Rio, positioning her hands on the counter.</p><p>"Don't test me, little girl. Do you know who I am? Or, perhaps, your little stalking didn't go that far."</p><p>A challenge? Exactly what Rio loved. She got even closer, face–to–face with the older woman, and she saw the anger in her eyes raising towards the stars.</p><p>"Or what? Mrs. Harkness, are you going to fire me, in my own workplace?"</p><p>"Rio!" Alice rushed to her, as she had heard the conversation (since, well, they weren't exactly speaking quietly), she feared having the customer upset, especially when the costumer was Agatha Harkness.</p><p>"Please, ma'am, forgive her–, she's very eloquent, more than so–, she lacks discipline."</p><p>"What?!" Alice quickly glared at Rio, and it was enough to make her shut up. Rio knew how dangerous angry Alice was; she had seen it <em>twice</em>. </p><p>The first time, was when she had found out Rio had slept with her childhood friend, who was very dear to her, and the second time was when she had almost burned her whole kitchen down, causing Alice's ex (who was a police officer), to rush and fill a report, when they haven't spoken in ages. So, she had learned her lesson.</p><p>Agatha grunted. "If she keeps behaving like this, she'll make your business fail. I'm warning you–, these brats will do anything to lead you to failure."</p><p>"Yes, you're right. Rio, apologise. Now."</p><p>"But–, Alice!"</p><p>"Now."</p><p>Rio had never faced such humiliation, and she was even more angry at seeing Agatha's satisfied smirk that instantly grew on her face. But, she had to. Not for herself, but for Alice. So, she faced the woman, smiled and changed her tone of voice, in a more calmer one.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Mrs. Harkness. It won't happen again..."</p><p>Alice coughed, and Rio knew what she meant by that. She sighed even more.</p><p>"...And this drink is on the house, along with a five dollar discount on any of our products. It lasts one week," Rio rolled her eyes, as she crossed her arms, "make <em>sure</em> to use them."</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly, "Alice, right? You really did train her well. I'm impressed–, apologize accepted," she smiled at Alice, only for her to grab the drink and walk away.</p><p>Alice then stared at Rio, but Rio refused to remove her eyes from Agatha. It was a snap from Alice's fingers that brought her back to reality, "Rio, what was that all about?"</p><p>"She pissed me off."</p><p>"Whatever it is, please don't do it again. Agatha Harkness is very powerful, with a simple word, she can make sure to never let you work again or make any activities close. I don't want that, it's–," Alice's gaze saddened, for a quick moment, "it's the only thing I have left that reminds me of my mother."</p><p>Rio's hand went on Alice's shoulder, in an attempt to comfort her friend. "I'm sorry, I should've kept it cool. It won't happen again, I promise."</p><p>And she smiled. "I know, I trust you," she reassured, "and, I don't know if you've read the group–chat, but Jen told us to go to the new nearby pub, it's exclusively for us since it's a," she turned around, to make sure no one was hearing, "it's a <em>lesbian</em> pub, so, it'll be fun."</p><p>"Jeez, Jen can't keep her hands to herself? She just went to a heartbreak, again."</p><p>"You know how she is–, also, it's been a while since you relaxed, or fucked anyone–, again, I think it's your opportunity and, I'm feeling kind, so I'll let you bring the girl you'll chose at home!"</p><p>Rio's eyes resembled the one of a puppy. If she had a tail, it'd be wagging non–stop. "Alice, I literally am one second away to kissing you."</p><p>She laughed, "Rio, focus on your work now."</p><p>And so she did, working as hard as ever.</p><p>—</p><p>Night soon came. The café was closed, and she was in her apartment, with Alice, getting ready for the (big) night they would've faced.</p><p>Alice had in mind to keep it low, maybe kissing two or three women, or maybe just drinking, or dancing with a random girl. She had no expectations, while Rio, she was ready to hunt, as she would say, to bring someone home, to have a good and <em>long</em> fuck, what she seemed to need.</p><p>Alice's outfit was nice; a pair of baggy jeans that was of the darkest colour on the market, a white tank–top, little make–up and a white carabiner on the left sight of her jeans, she didn't play. Her hair curly as ever, though some curls didn't properly do the curve.</p><p>"You ready?"</p><p>Rio's outfit, which had probably four hours in advance, consisted of a pair of long jeans, they weren't baggy like Alice's, but had some holes in them, in case if some (wanted) hand entered undisturbed, she wore a shirt that quoted: '<em>single, and ready to mingle</em>'. Leather jacket, and her hair up, but with some of them out.</p><p>"Do I look too desperate?" Rio asked, as was definitely talking about the quote on her shirt, but Alice laughed and reassured her.</p><p>"Nah–, it's funny, you always put your humour before your look, you're not ugly, Rio, remember that."</p><p>"Wow, Alice, I might take you home instead of some random girl."</p><p>Alice laughed, and then the doorbell rang, Jen had arrived, and they both rushed to meet her. She wore a long pink dress, lots of jewellery, and a make–up that emphasised her eyes.</p><p>"Girls, ready?"</p><p>Rio and Alice grabbed their purses. They headed out of the apartment, feeling ready.</p><p>—</p><p>They arrived at the club, and soon Rio started regretting doing that. The three of them stood before the entrance, loud music coming out of the place, Alice and Jen were excited while Rio, well, she didn't exactly know.</p><p>"Well, let's go," Jen, being the braver one, had entered, and soon she was followed by Rio and Alice. Once inside, Rio's mood brightened up, and her two friends had noticed.</p><p>"So, let's meet at 2 am, here–, if we're drunk, we immediately call each other, if we're uncomfortable, we leave and, well–, if we're lucky, let's talk about that <em>tomorrow</em>," Jen gave out the orders, as if she walked in these sorts of environments, and the duo couldn't help but nod, as they took separate ways.</p><p>Rio sat on a chair of the bar, as she ordered something strong, probably with whiskey or vodka, whatever the difference was. Once the drink came, she took a sip, examining the girls that were there; some were cute, others gorgeous, but one of them had caught her attention. She had deep black hair, and she was dancing, <em>divinely</em>.</p><p>She stared at her, until she noticed that there was another woman dancing with her, and she frowned, great, someone had '<em>stole</em>' her. Another sip of the drink, then another, and then she noticed that the woman was walking towards the bar, where she was, as she sat not that far from her.</p><p>Finally, that was her opportunity. As she watched her sit down, but couldn't quite catch a glimpse of her face, she called for the barista, asking her to give a drink to that woman that was two seats away from her, and the barista asked which kind of drink, and she must've blurted out something weird because she had a perplexed look in her eyes.</p><p>"Uhm–, are you sure?"</p><p>And Rio nodded, and she could feel her head heavier. She wasn't a drinker, never had been, so the alcohol must've been messing with her senses, but she wasn't drunk, drunk (she was drunk, like very drunk, but didn't want to admit it). She turned around, as she waited for the woman to sit next to her, and she saw Alice making out with two girls, she was <em>so</em> proud.</p><p>"Fucking go Alice!" She yelled at her friend, who hadn't heard her because the music was loud, and the alcohol was starting to make her see things.</p><p>But then, the woman had sat next to her, she could hear her giggles, and she wondered why was she laughing, and why was that laugh so annoyingly familiar . "You must be pretty drunk to have ordered a black coffee for me, at a pub, full of girls who would spend money on drinks to get me–," suddenly, she had stopped, and Rio turned around to look at her, and she... Didn't <em>recognise</em> her.</p><p>"You?!" Of course, it was Agatha. And Rio didn't understand, she had no idea of who she was.</p><p>"Hi?"</p><p>"The <em>FUCK</em> are you doing here?"</p><p>Rio really focused on her face, licking her lips, an action she only did when she was really focused. Something was missing, the woman felt oddly familiar, but also a complete stranger. So, Rio pondered on a old and classy pick–up line, after all, they were in a pub.</p><p>"I'm here to have fun with you, er–," Rio sucked at small talks, pick–up lines, and many other things, "<em>baby</em>?"</p><p>"Oh my God."</p><p>Agatha shook her head, only to stand up from the chair. She then took Rio's wrist as they started walking towards the smoker area of the pub, Rio felt as if she would've been fucked right there, in the smoker area.</p><p>Alice spotted Rio, and smiled, visibly drunk, "Rio, my girl! Go get it," she yelled, only to return on the dance floor. She just wanted to hype her.</p><p>And Rio laughed, <em>maybe</em>, the stranger wasn't so bad.</p>

<p>The smoker's area. Rio technically had quit smoking, but <em>sometimes</em> she would take the habit only to drop it again. She didn't have an addiction, of course, or so, she thought.</p><p>So, when the duo arrived there, the music was just a white noise, and everything seemed to be still, as if time didn't flow. There were other people, but too caught up to notice what was going on. Rio smiled, and Agatha could feel her patience running low.</p><p>Agatha slammed Rio to the wall, getting closer to her, in what may have looked like a <em>kabedon</em>, the move of k–dramas that Rio enjoyed so much, not because she liked the tension, but because she enjoyed good and old cringe. The move consisted of pinning the woman against the wall, as the man got closer, while his hand was still on the wall, as if he were to trap her. But, this kabedon was different because there was no man, but two women.</p><p>"Uhm–," Rio spoke, trying hard to speak fluently. She had to use short sentences, a few words. She hoped for the other woman to be as drunk as her. Where's the fun in being the sober one? "Is this the part where we fuck? I mean–, we're outside, you could've chosen a better place. But I don't mind."</p><p>Agatha stared at her. She wanted to scream, but that would've drawn attention to her, so she took another route. "Do you <em>seriously</em> not recognise me?"</p><p>Now, Rio was <em>clearly</em> drunk, but she wasn't stupid. She did think that the woman was familiar, very familiar, but she couldn't quite put a finger on it. Maybe, she was joking around.</p><p>"Is this some kind of <em>role</em>–<em>play</em>? I've never done it before."</p><p>Agatha got closer to her, closer than ever, as she started whispering. She did look behind her twice, thrice, but no one would've eavesdropped at a place like that, "I'm Agatha, Agatha Harkness."</p><p>Rio stared at her, then laughed. "Okay, you'll be Agatha Harkness, I'll be Rio Vidal, which is actually me, you know–," she cleared her throat, "I'll be a barista, which is actually my job, and you'll be whatever that woman does as a job, probably torture. Okay, I'll start–"</p><p>"Wait–"</p><p>"Mrs. Harkness, what will you have? Black coffee or cappuccino?"</p><p>Agatha was perplexed, but then she laughed as she went to pinch the bridge of her nose, the audacity of this girl.</p><p>"Uhm, <em>whatever–your–real–name–is</em>, it's your turn–"</p><p>She rolled her eyes, wondering when was the right time to call her friends or an ambulance. Nevertheless, she indulged in <em>whatever</em> was going on, thinking that nothing would've happened.</p><p>"Cappuccino, since you know how to make shitty heart shapes."</p><p>"Wow, how did you know I make shitty heart shapes?!" Rio gasped, taking an eccessive liking to this act. Oh, if only she knew.</p><p>"Just a hunch," she quickly dismissed.</p><p>"You're really good, <em>whatever–your–real–name–is</em>! Let's continue."</p><p>Agatha had a bad feeling.</p><p>"For the drink, I need a way of payment."</p><p>"Sure, cash or card?"</p><p>Rio got closer, positioning her hands around her waist, as they slid down to touch her ass, pulling her closer. Agatha could've leapt back or ceased whatever was happening, but she didn't. She stared at Rio, whose eyes were as fierce as of when she and her discussed, as she wondered what was happening in her little head.</p><p>"Neither of them–," she smiled, "I only accepted a way," Rio got closer to her, tiptoeing to balance the little height difference that divided them, her lips were almost touching hers, and Agatha had to do something, she had to stop her, "and that way is a <em>kiss</em>."</p><p>Agatha felt warmness, and a deep suffocating feeling in her throat, her stomach ached, she had to act fast, she had to stop what was happening. She knew that she had to, and, suddenly, as she was about to block Rio's lips, to push her away, Rio <em>fell </em>asleep. Not on the ground, but in Agatha's arms.</p><p>"Rio?!"</p><p>—</p><p>Rio had woken up in her bed, no girls besides her, which made her sigh. Her head was loud, her body weak. It was then that Alice walked in her room, holding some medicine.</p><p>"Rio–"</p><p>"Alice, <em>please</em>–, tell me that I didn't embarrass myself."</p><p>"You did embarrass yourself, yeah–," Alice laughed as she watched her friend almost crying, "but, I was all drunk when she called for me. She used your phone to call me, I was too drunk to figure out who she was, but–, she wasn't angry, rather smiley. <em>Whatever</em> you did, it wasn't so bad."</p><p>And Rio smiled, as she took the medicine Alice had handed her. "Whatever, how did it go for you?"</p><p>"Oh–, pretty okay? Nothing too exceptional–," which was weird, unsual for Alice to tell her that little, "anyway, get ready. We'll be at work in about an hour."</p><p>"We have to work?"</p><p>"Yeah, duty calls. Always."</p><p>Rio groaned, only to sit up on her bed. Great, work with an hungover.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio's head rested on the counter as she tried to look presentable to her clients. Some were understanding, other not, which made her angry. Had they not been in a hangover before? As terrible as her day was, something even more terrible had happened: <em>Agatha Harkness</em> had entered the café.</p><p>But Rio didn't even manage to lift her head up, Agatha already stood before her.</p><p>"Long night?" Agatha asked, which left Rio completely weirded out, as if she was worried of her state. But, of course, she came here for the discount she was <em>forced</em> to do.</p><p>"Yeah–," Rio sighed, standing up completely, "too much alchool, little memories, rather not talk about it, anyway–, what will you have?"</p><p>"You sure have big bags under your eyes."</p><p>She insisted? But why? She was usually against any type of human interactions, no, she really wasn't the type.</p><p>"Not everyone can be as beautiful as yourself, Mrs. Harkness."</p><p>Agatha's cheeks began to turn slightly rosy, only to laugh nervously, "I see, you still have some alcohol left in you."</p><p>Rio was panicking. What was going on? Why wasn't she mad at her? And, why had she said something <em>so</em> flirtatious?</p><p>"And, it's <em>Ms</em>. Harkness. I don't have a husband. You must've seen pictures of my son when you saw my profile, but it's not like that."</p><p>Ok, someone had definitely kidnapped the real Agatha Harkness.</p><p>"Why are you telling me this?"</p><p>"Felt like it. Now, can I have my cappuccino?"</p><p>"Not your usual black coffee?"</p><p>Agatha smiled, and Rio's heart felt heavier.</p><p>"No, I want to see your <em>shitty</em> heart shapes."</p><p>Rio felt weird, as if that conversation had already happened before. She couldn't remember when or how. But, something <em>was</em> familiar, too familiar.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Agatha snorted. "Nothing, just be quick."</p><p>Rio prepared the exact same order and handed it to Agatha, with a smile on her face. She did smile because she was scared, and deep down, she thought that Agatha was acting <em>very</em> weird.</p><p>"Uhm, will you use your discount?"</p><p>"No, I'm paying fully–, but if there are other ways of payment, let me know."</p><p>That conversation felt surreal, and it was taking weird turns. Why was Agatha acting like this? And why was Rio so intrigued yet scared?</p><p>"Cash or card."</p><p>"Really? Nothing else?"</p><p>"<em>Nothing else</em>."</p><p>Agatha paid the coffee and immediately headed out of the café. Rio's eyes lingered on her, not being able to pull away.</p><p>"What just happened?" Alice asked, as she may have overheard the whole thing.</p><p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>Rio had tried her best to remember what had happened that night at the pub. She had asked Alice, but she had quickly dismissed her, saying she didn't remember while <em>blaming</em> it on the alcohol. Then, she had asked Jen, but she, too, didn't seem to remember much. The only thing she remembered was crying on the sofas while some girls comforted her. And Rio thought that if she were with Jen, she would've probably bursted out laughing at her.</p><p>So, she was in her room. It was her day off, and Alice was in the kitchen, reviewing some stuff, trying to do something business–related. Rio knew she had to not disturb her because, well, angry Alice was scary, but stressed Alice was <em>even</em> scarier.</p><p>She wouldn't have spoken to her. Not yet.</p><p>Rio's mind then wandered to Agatha's words, innuendos, her worried tone of voice. Just, what had happened? Why was she acting so weird? It wasn't her usual self. Rio cursed herself because, without wanting to, she was, once again, on her Instagram profile. She clicked on a random photo of her as she examined her whole visage; her eyes still icy, her hair long and silky, and those lips — she was going to smash the phone to the ground.</p><p>It was Alice who had brought her to reality, knocking on the door. "Rio," Alice started speaking as she entered the room, "I was wondering what were you up to."</p><p>Rio quickly hid her phone under the pillow. <em>Thankfully</em>, Alice hadn't noticed. "Nothing much, trying to figure–, I was trying to figure out who the stranger from that night was."</p><p>Alice smiled as she walked towards her bed, sitting on the end, "Rio, for you to care about a fling–," she laughed, "she must have charmed you!"</p><p>"Charmed me so good that I can't even remember a thing."</p><p>She rolled her eyes, knowing exactly what she had to do. "Come on, get ready, we're going out."</p><p>"What?! What about your paper–work?"</p><p>"Don't worry about it. It's my sworn <em>duty</em> as your best friend to cheer you up."</p><p>Alice had always been a great friend to Rio, often making her wonder what she had done in her life to deserve such great friendship. It was rare, comforting, and <em>unbelievably</em> beautiful.</p><p>"Alright–, but I get to pick the food!"</p><p>"That hispanic restaurant, correct?"</p><p>Rio jumped out of her bed. Was she that predictable? Or maybe Alice had an even stronger memory than her, which scared her.</p><p>"Yeah, well–, sometimes, I miss my origins."</p><p>"It's okay to miss them. Don't feel embarrassed. I know how feel you free when you speak spanish, I can hear it when your parents call. It's nice."</p><p>Rio attempted to smile. "God, you sound like Billy."</p><p>And she chuckled softly, "I know, right? Now, get ready."</p><p>—</p><p>The duo had arrived at the restaurant. It wasn't crowded or particularly busy, and Rio felt safe, as if she was at home. That place had been an anchor to her. Whenever she missed her parents or friends, she would go there and eat until she couldn't stand up properly, that's why Alice had always gone with her.</p><p>They entered and were immediately greeted by a waiter, which beamed at seeing Rio and Alice. After all, the two were his favourite customers (also known as the ones who would leave a huge tip).</p><p>"Alice," he waved at her, only to gaze at Rio afterwards, "and Rio. ¿<em>Cómo has estado</em>?"</p><p>Rio smiled at hearing such words, simple yet so powerful. "<em>Ahora ya estoy bien</em>."</p><p>The waiter smiled while he walked them towards their table. Once there, they both sat and picked up the menù. There were so many options, so much delicious food. Maybe, that was what Rio needed the most.</p><p>As Alice was about to form a sentence, she <em>immediately</em> stopped, leaving Rio incredulous. It was as if she saw a ghost, and she feared knowing what she had really seen.</p><p>"Rio–, don't turn around."</p><p>But of course, she didn't listen. She turned around, and there she was, <em>Agatha Harkness</em> with someone, a redhead with soft lineaments, and a warm gaze. They looked good together, perhaps <em>too</em> good for Rio's liking. Luckily, Agatha hadn't seen her.</p><p>"Fuck," she whispered, while turning to face Alice, who had a disappointing yet understanding look in her eyes. "What do we do?"</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"What if she catches us–?"</p><p>Alice was starting to worry, as she noticed an increase, alarming red on Rio's cheeks, drops of sweats were appearing on her temples. That only happened when, <em>oh</em>.</p><p>"What of it?" Alice had seen Rio like that <em>once</em>. It meant one thing, one obvious truth. It was difficult to impress Rio. She had been with others before, true, but when someone does catch her attention, she becomes quite insufferable.</p><p>"What of it? What–, I mean, uh," Rio started to realise that if Agatha had seen them, nothing would've happened. They were two different people, with two very different lives.</p><p>"Rio–, are you," she bit her lip, "do you want to tell me <em>something</em>?"</p><p>Rio's eyes widened. She had understood but pretended not to. "No, I don't. There's nothing going on!"</p><p>"I didn't say that, I asked you if there's something troubling you. It's different."</p><p>It was irritating, Rio stood up from the chair, making a loud noise, her hands clenched on the borders of the table. Alice was shocked, and so was Rio. She stared at her, only to scream, "I said there's nothing going on!"</p><p>All eyes were on Rio, but she could only sense her eyes, Agatha's eyes. She felt trapped.</p><p>"Rio, it's okay–"</p><p>Rio grabbed her purse. She knew there was a pack of cigarettes there, along her lighter. Smoking, that's what would've calmed her down.</p><p>"I'll be back in a bit."</p><p>Alice nodded, she knew not to mess with Rio when she was like that. She would've let her cool down, she would've waited for the right moment.</p><p>Rio walked past Agatha, still feeling her eyes on her.</p><p>"What was that?" The redhead asked, worrying for someone she didn't even know. She must've had a caring nature.</p><p>"Wait here, Wanda."</p><p>And with hasty steps, she went outside, trying to catch up with Rio.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio sat on a bench, a cigarette on the hand while the other played with her lighter. Why, in all places, was Agatha Harkness there? As if she was tormenting her, doing it on purpose. She didn't even understand why was she so affected by her presence, she should've been focused on the stranger of the pub, but obviously wasn't. Finding her would've been impossible, and perhaps she had given up.</p><p>After a while of being there, Agatha coughed to make her presence known, making Rio jump on her seat. How could she not have noticed her? And, for how long had she been there?</p><p>"You okay?" Her voice was doubtful, for once, Rio didn't noticed the strictness of her usual self. She was different.</p><p>"I'm perfectly fine."</p><p>Agatha sat next to her, and Rio didn't look away, as she thought she would've done.</p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p>She insisted, yet <em>again</em>. She knew something was up, even though Rio herself didn't know what was wrong with her.</p><p>"Just a little discussion," which was true, but her and Alice rarely argued. Rio saddened at remembering and sighed, but trying not to let the other woman show her frustrations.</p><p>And Agatha didn't know what to say. They sat, in absolute silence, occasionally looking at one another. It was Agatha to break the silence, with a soft laugh.</p><p>"You act like a child."</p><p><em>Wow</em>, did this woman not know how to comfort people? Perhaps, she never had to do such a thing.</p><p>"And you suck with words."</p><p>Agatha's laugh became louder, which made Rio smile, even if she tried to hide it. She hated herself, deeply.</p><p>"We all have our faults," she added, "but, I think you should get inside, your friend looked quite sad, and," continued, while doing her best to remain calm, "you should apologise to her, properly."</p><p>Rio started to feel annoyed, her patience was running low. "You don't have to tell me what to do, Ms. Harkness. I'm more capable than you think."</p><p>Agatha smiled, and Rio's anger only increased. Was she making fun of her? She didn't know, she was so enigmatic. More than usual.</p><p>"Alright then, I'll take my leave."</p><p>She stood up, and Rio wanted to say something before she left. She thought of so many questions, from stupid ones to important ones. But, she had to be fast.</p><p>"Why are you acting like this?"</p><p>She stopped, her icy eyes meeting the brown ones.</p><p>"Like what?"</p><p>"You're being nice. It's <em>weird</em>."</p><p>Agatha pondered on what to say. As if she didn't want to say the wrong thing or something useless, perhaps being too scared of breaking her serious character.</p><p>"You say it's 'weird', well," she paused, trying to search for the right words, "I can be weird at times, but it's not weird to be worried about someone."</p><p>"Why worrying about me? We're strangers, and because of <em>you</em>, I got lectured by my boss," Rio reminded her, as she seemed to have forgotten what she had done and the humiliation she had gone through because of her.</p><p>There was something left unsaid, and Rio didn't understand. There was a missing piece into this puzzle, and she was struggling to complete it. Which frustrated her.</p><p>And Agatha's gaze seemed absent, for an instant. "You're right, I shouldn't have asked you that, I won't pry more. Enjoy your evening."</p><p>Rio watched her go, and she let out a breath of pure desperation. Why was her heart aching? Why was she feeling like this? Angry, sad, confused. Agatha Harkness was someone who couldn't be trusted under any circumstances. And Rio should've let those thoughts go.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio had returned to her seat, and Alice was still there. She smiled to her friend as her attentive eyes watched her every movement.</p><p>"You good?"</p><p>"Yeah–, yeah," Rio sat down, thinking about a good apologise, like Agatha had told her. Wait? Why was she thinking of what she had said? She shook her head, "Alice, I'm sorry."</p><p>"It's fine, really. You had a little moment of stress. It happens, I'm not angry."</p><p>"You were right."</p><p>Alice's head tilted, "I was right?"</p><p>"Yeah. There is something going on, but I don't know what. I feel things I don't understand, I–," she breathed, only to continue shortly after, "I think I'm stressed about finding the woman of the pub, because, even if I don't remember a shit about her, I feel this <em>weird</em> connection."</p><p>Her friend listened carefully, without ever interrupting. She cared, so much.</p><p>"You don't remember? Like, at all?"</p><p>"Nothing, Alice–, I remember her laughs, and her eyes, and her hair. And the way she would look at me–, God, I'm so pathetic."</p><p>Alice went to take her hand, squeezing it tight, "Rio, you will find her. I'm sure of it, don't give up just yet. I know it might seem impossible, but everything will be alright."</p><p>Rio's eyes became almost teary, as she tried to not show it. "How can you be so sure?"</p><p>"Because you're Rio, and everything <em>annoyingly</em> goes your way."</p><p>That comment had made Rio laugh, and Alice brighten up at seeing that reaction.</p><p>"Well, can we eat now?"</p><p>Alice grinned, "I'm starving."</p><p>—</p><p>The dinner was fine, more than so. Delicious food, along a glass of wine. Everything would've been perfect if Rio <em>stopped</em> gazing over Agatha's table, that was not that far from them.</p><p>Her eyes lingered on Agatha's figure, and on the woman that was with her. She was pretty, her red hair tied in a pony–tail that revealed her neck, and jawline. And her eyes, the ones only a motherly figure would possess.</p><p>Agatha was smiling, laughing even, at every thing the other woman said. There was not a moment of silence between them, not even when the food had arrived. Rio had never imagined seeing Agatha so relaxed, so unserious.</p><p>"What are you staring at? Your eyes are about to fall off." Alice commented as she eat the last piece of her meal.</p><p>"Uh–," at that moment, Agatha had removed her eyes from the redhead (probably feeling observed), and she stared at Rio, and they both didn't look away, as if their eyes were talking for them.</p><p>"Rio?"</p><p>Rio snapped back to reality, interrupting whatever was happening between her and Agatha, focusing on her worried friend.</p><p>"Uh, I was thinking."</p><p>"Thinking while staring at the wall? It's creepy, you know that?"</p><p>She ignored her, only to turn her gaze back on Agatha. But then, she saw her grabbing the arm of the redhead, as she smiled while doing so. They looked so much like a couple, and that infuriated Rio. But why? Why was she feeling that way? It was strange, ridiculous, and yet, it was a very <em>real</em> feeling.</p><p>"Let's just go, Alice–," Rio said while standing up. She glanced at Agatha, and still, she wasn't reciprocating the stare. Again.</p><p>"So soon?"</p><p>"We have work tomorrow, don't we? We need to rest."</p><p>Alice stood up, "I need a moment, I have to use the restroom. Wait a second–," she then hurried to reach the room, leaving Rio alone.</p><p>Now, Rio had <em>two</em> options; ignoring the irritating feeling of seeing Agatha being way too friendly with the other lady, or wait for Alice to come back, staying as still as ever.</p><p>But Rio was smart in terms of academics, but not so much when it came to personal matters. So, with hasty steps, she moved towards Agatha's table. She didn't know what she would've said, and when she positioned herself in between the two women, standing still, she stared firstly at Agatha, then at the redhead. And now? The two had a very perplexed look in their eyes. Oh, Rio had to say something.</p><p>"Ms. Harkness–,' she began, her anger turning into nervousness, "I'm about to leave, thought I'd say bye to you," then, her eyes went on the redhead, only to go back to Agatha.</p><p>The redhead smiled, probably having no idea on what was going on, "Agatha, is this the barista you've been talking about?"</p><p>Wait, was Agatha <em>talking</em> about her? Rio felt thousands of emotions, and she could've swore that none of them were bad, rather a pleasing experience. So, she smiled, and that was enough to boost her confidence.</p><p>"Ms. Harkness must've told you about my cappuccinos, which are the best in the whole town!"</p><p>The redhead laughed, as Agatha began to feel as if she was the third–wheel, a mere guest in a conversation that had been, initially, started with other intetions.</p><p>"She enjoys them! And she laughs every time she stares at the shapes, she says–"</p><p>"Wanda, <em>enough</em>."</p><p>'Wanda', so that was her name. Rio noted it mentally, she would've found out more later.</p><p>Rio turned to see Agatha, and her cheeks were slightly red. Was she embarrassed? But, nothing too scandalous had been said, yet.</p><p>"Oh Agatha, don't be shy!" Wanda waved at her, "so, what's your name?"</p><p>"Rio, it's nice meeting you," they shook hands, and Rio noticed how soft her hands were, and wondered if those same hands had touched Agatha, in a <em>different</em> way.</p><p>"Rio! What a cute name!"</p><p>Agatha glared at Wanda, her gaze was serious. And Wanda could already feel that her demise was near, very near.</p><p>But Rio didn't seem to have thought of something flirtatious. She simply smiled, per usual.</p><p>"Are you two done?"</p><p>Wanda smiled, Rio turned her gaze back to Agatha. There was something different in her eyes, as if she was restraining herself from saying something dangerous.</p><p>"Come on Agatha, I'm trying to get to know Rio!"</p><p>Rio had sensed something, and, if her intuition was right (which she knew it was), Agatha must've been jealous. Indeed, Rio was being too friendly with Wanda. And, perhaps, Agatha was jealous of her 'flirting' with Wanda, whatever the relationship with the two was. She wanted to push some buttons.</p><p>"Well, Wanda–, if you want, you can pass by my café, I <em>promise</em> to do a discount," she winked at the redhead, and abruptly, Agatha had stood up from the chair, her hands firm on the table, her lips parted, as if she was about to say something.</p><p>"Let's go, Wanda."</p><p>"But, Agatha–, what about the dessert?"</p><p>"Forget it."</p><p>And Agatha grabbed her purse and immediately started walking away, Wanda whispered a low '<em>sorry</em>', as if she went running towards her friend.</p><p>Rio had this satisfied smirk on her lips. </p><p>Alice had returned. "Okay, we can go–, wait, why are you smiling? Did something happen?"</p><p>"No," she stared at Agatha, one last time, "<em>nothing has happened</em>."</p>

<p>Agatha knew what she was destined for since she was a child; greatness, riches, and many opportunities to learn. She was the daughter of <em>Evanora Harkness</em>, the most brilliant leader of her times. A living legend, a myth.</p><p>And, of course, Agatha grew up with a <em>lot</em> of expectations. She was the most brilliant student during high–school, winning prices and recognition left and right, surprising even the teachers themselves, and she had been <em>valedictorian</em> at her prestigious college, where, again, had left the professors speechless. Her academic achievements were great, greater than every other student.</p><p>But her mother, Evanora Harkness, was hard to impress. Agatha could remember not seeing her during her final graduation. Instead, she had sent a family friend, Lilia Calderu, to watch over her every move.</p><p>Lilia was kind, a second mother to Agatha, if not her first one. She always showed affection towards her, cheering her up whenever she had a moment of sadness. Agatha was grateful to have her.</p><p>As time went by, Agatha took the leads of her mother's company. She was an impeccable boss, and everyone feared yet worshipped her, but that, still, wasn't enough to Evanora. Even if she was retired, she would sometimes show up in the office, causing troubles and messing with Agatha's work, saying it was '<em>imperfect</em>'.</p><p>Agatha never told her to stop, being too scared to do so. So, she kept her emotions hidden in order to please her mother. But not only her emotions, also her true demeanour, her true way of acting, everything <em>behind</em> a mask. Thrown it away.</p><p>There was another thing that Agatha was hiding from her, and that was her <em>sexuality</em>; she was a lesbian, meaning that she couldn't have seen a future with a man. <em>Ever</em>.</p><p>When Agatha was younger, she had tried to fit in to be 'normal', even if she didn't quite know what it meant to be 'normal'. So, she tried dating men; smart ones, quiet ones, good–looking ones, heck, she even tried the dumb ones. But she simply wasn't attracted to. She felt repulsed by them. </p><p>Not to mention the <em>sex</em>, she hated it so much. It was so bland, repetitive, and boring. They just went straight to the point, doing nothing else, besides satisfying their own needs, Agatha didn't even come once, not even by mistake.</p><p>It was around her late twenties when she had been with a woman for the <em>first</em> time. Sure, there had been feelings and fantasies about women, but she had never thought of acting upon it. But, when she had found herself in front of a lesbian pub, she thought of what she had to lose. And, well, it went better than <em>expected</em>.</p><p>So, she tried different pubs—, every time she felt sad, she would go there to unwind. It might not have been healthy, but it worked for Agatha. That's perfectly fine.</p><p>But, something had happened that made her fall into a deep spiral of depression, shame; she was pregnant. Which was weird because Agatha had always used protection, taken pills, and everything.</p><p>Agatha was in her late twenties, <em>pregnant</em>. It might've sounded like an insane fever dream, but that was her reality. And when she had told the father (she knew who it was, they had broken up recently), he just ran away, and so, she was alone.</p><p>Eventually, her mother knew of her pregnancy and, oh, the <em>pain</em> Agatha had to endure. Evanora told her to abort the baby, but Agatha fought hard to keep it. She even moved towns, but the hate of her mother reached her everywhere she went. It was stressful. If it wasn't for Lilia that took care of her (in secret), she would've probably given up.</p><p>The baby was born—, beautiful, healthy, and with blue eyes that resembled the ones Agatha had. It was by then that Evanora had ceased her hate, she had met the child, and something changed even if not completely.</p><p>Agatha was a single mother at the age of thirty; there were many rumours, stares, and many bad things said about her. But, she didn't care–, she loved that child, who she had named Nicholas, Nicky for short.</p><p>She had given up her everything to raise him, but when he had reached the age of six, Agatha had decided that she wanted a better future for him. So, she returned to her mother's company, becoming the CEO. And she was brilliant at her job, she had become even better.</p><p>Agatha had fired the employees that her mother had hired and found new ones, making the rumours cease to exist (even if not completely). There she was, with her new life, for her son — working hard as ever.</p><p>Lilia helped her baby–sitting Nicholas, in those rare occasions where Agatha would go out to relax, and Lilia had reassured her many times that it was good to have some '<em>alone–time</em>'. And so, whenever she was free, she would've gone to those pubs she felt so free, so understood.</p><p>Time went by, and Agatha had come to the terms that she would've been alone, forever. Because, well, who would've wanted to be with someone old, and with a kid? But, she wasn't sad. As long as she kept going to the pubs, her emptiness would've been filled, even if for a short while.</p><p>But, things changed when Agatha had met Rio. She, who was feared by many, was not feared by her, and that had made something shift in Agatha. The charming barista, with an irritating personality and with eyes so fierce that could've scared every human being. Irritating smile, annoying laugh, and a dammed way with her words.</p><p>Agatha didn't understand how she, who was younger than her, was able to match her energy so perfectly.</p><p>When Rio had been so <em>straightforward</em> at the pub, with those eyes that Agatha had never forgotten, or when they almost kissed, but of course, that memory was better to be forgotten, she couldn't let someone that young to influence her course of thoughts.</p><p>But then, why was Agatha still thinking of Rio? And why had she gotten so angry when Rio flirted with Wanda, her friend?</p><p>Wanda had reassured her that Rio was merely joking, but that didn't mean anything.</p><p>So, she <em>thought</em> of a plan.</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha rarely let her emotions have the best on her. She would usually breathe, letting all the thoughts go, but that wasn't the case. No, she had to talk to Rio. She had to let her know that flirting — especially with her friend — was strictly forbidden. It was stupid, she knew it, but she had already decided.</p><p>It was around 7'30 am, when Agatha stood before the entrance of the café, waiting. She waited for Rio to arrive. Technically, she didn't know if she would've been there, opening the café. She had searched on the Internet the opening times of the café, and she had found the exact opening time. Internet, what a <em>scary</em> thing.</p><p>And Agatha waited and waited — until almost half an hour had passed, she was late for work. For her, to be late at her own workplace, she could already hear the voices of the newbies, starting nasty rumours.</p><p>As she was about to go away, she saw Rio walking towards the café, humming a melody while distractingly looking at her phone, and Agatha started feeling nervous. Perhaps her whole idea was wrong, as she didn't know what to say.</p><p>Rio stood before her as she looked at her. Agatha could sense her confusion.</p><p>"Mr. Harkness—?" She spoke, surprised to see the woman there, "I'm sorry, but I think the machines for the coffee need some warm–up before they start functioning properly."</p><p>"I didn't come here for your <em>stupid</em> coffee," Agatha could feel her words heavier, as her brown eyes never once looked away. Rather, they were intrigued.</p><p>"What for then?"</p><p>"What's your deal?!"</p><p>Rio crossed her arms as she was starting to wonder what was up. Agatha hands were clenched into fists, and Rio began to smile, looking <em>annoyingly</em> cute while doing so. Wait, cute? Agatha shook her head.</p><p>"What do you mean, Ms. Harkness? I'm just going to work."</p><p>"Why were you flirting with my friend?"</p><p>She had said it — what was bothering her, eating her alive. Rio, at first, looked at her in a very confused way. Then, her smile widened while not even trying to hide her amusement.</p><p>"What's your relationship with Wanda?" Rio asked, perhaps being way too bold or noisy. Either way, she had surprised Agatha, whose lips were shut solemnly. She thought for a while for a right answer.</p><p>"That's <em>none</em> of your concerns."</p><p>"Then, it's not <em>your</em> concern to tell me with who to flirt — I'm perfectly able to do whatever I want."</p><p>Rio had this infuriating smirk on her lips as if she knew what buttons she had to push to obliterate Agatha's patience.</p><p>"Now, if this conversation is over, I'm going to open the café."</p><p>Agatha took Rio by her wrist. The grip was so firm, as if she didn't want to let her enter — to end the conversation. She had a saddening gaze, making Rio wonder her true motive.</p><p>Rio had the keys of the café in her hands, and she struggled to keep holding them. Because Agatha's hand was soft but also scared — she could feel her trembling.</p><p>Agatha gathered up enough courage.</p><p>"Do you really don't remember?"</p><p>Brown eyes looked as big as the moon. Agatha's cheeks began to be painted in a rosy, red colour — seemingly to be embarrassed.</p><p>"Remember? What?" Rio didn't understand. She simply stood there, as if someone had put a spell on her, making her feel thousands of needles in her heart.</p><p>"<em>You</em>," Agatha bit her lip, and looked away, "you and I, at the pub — you were drunk and almost kissed me. Then, you passed out, and I called your friend. You did a funny act, something called 'role–play', or whatever."</p><p>Then, Agatha removed her hand from her wrist, and finally, her gaze met hers.</p><p>"Remember now?"</p><p>Rio didn't even dare to speak a word — she smiled nervously, a sudden drop of sweat appearing on her temples, eyes dilated. She was slowly losing it, and Agatha could tell.</p><p>"Well? Cat got your tongue?" Agatha teased her in a vague attempt of lifting her worries.</p><p>But Rio, yet, had not told a word. After many minutes, and after many (failed) ways of getting a response out of her, Rio returned to reality.</p><p>"You were at the pub?"</p><p>Agatha coughed. "Yes."</p><p>"What were you doing there?"</p><p>Agatha laughed softly. That question was so out of place, yet so full of curiosity, "I mean, why do people go there? You know it well."</p><p>"You're <em>gay</em>?"</p><p>She rolled her eyes. She had never admitted out loud her sexuality — sure, she had told a few, but never in such direct way.</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"Did we kiss?"</p><p>Suddenly, the blush on her cheeks deepened. As she remembered how she was blocking Rio's lips, interrupting what was about to happen.</p><p>"No, we did not. You were drunk, I couldn't have let you do that."</p><p>Rio tightened the hold on her keys, "I see."</p><p>She smiled at Agatha, and then she went to open the door of the café. She opened the door and rushed to get in, only to shut the door behind on Agatha's face. And Agatha was left outside, alone, while Rio had blocked the entrance with her shoulders pressed on the door.</p><p>"Wait—," Agatha's hand went on the handler, but she couldn't open it since Rio was blocking the entrance. "Let's talk!"</p><p>"There's nothing to talk about!" Rio shouted, making Agatha wonder why such a reaction that was so childish, yet incredibly in character.</p><p>"There's a lot to talk about!"</p><p>"Ms. Harkness — just come back later, okay? I need to, really need to work."</p><p>Agatha let go of the handler. "Fine," she said, knowing Rio would've listened, "I'll see you later."</p><p>And then, she left the café. Her mind was a storm, full of doubts and worries. Had she done the right thing? She didn't know.</p>

<p>Rio's mind was a <em>mess</em> — many thoughts overflowing at such alarming speed. Rio had remembered everything, as those words came out of Agatha's mouth. The almost kiss, the 'role–play', the tension. She remembered that those eyes and hair were actually Agatha's.</p><p>But it couldn't be — what was Agatha doing in a pub? She wasn't the type to have fun, fuck some random girls and more. Perhaps, she truly didn't know Agatha Harkness, and the thick mask she was wearing was, but an illusion. She couldn't believe she was gay — and Rio felt happy, even if she couldn't quite figure out why of such happiness.</p><p>So, Agatha was the mysterious stranger of the pub, and Rio tried not to freak out at work — she couldn't have let Alice know that something had happened. But the waiting was so frustrating, Rio wondered when Agatha would show up or if she would've showed up.</p><p>Alice was on her phone, and she did not suspect a thing — Rio was doing a good job at hiding her emotions, which made her feel reassured.</p><p>Soon, sooner than expected, Agatha arrived, and she looked calm, as if she had not dropped the biggest reveal of Rio's life. She looked at Alice, who immediately ran to greet her (as always). And Agatha returned the greet.</p><p>"Alice, right? Can I borrow your barista for a second? She and I have something to discuss."</p><p>Alice looked very concerned. "Did she do something wrong, Mrs. Harkness? I can deal with her myself."</p><p>"No, don't worry. It'll be quick."</p><p>Agatha glanced at the barista, and Rio immediately walked towards her. She looked different, more in peace — perhaps, just an act.</p><p>"Follow me," Rio told Agatha, and she did as requested. While Alice, who had a sort–of smile on her lips, couldn't help but think that whatever they had to discuss wasn't so bad.</p><p>—</p><p>They reached a small, secluded area that was surrounded by trees and flowers. It wasn't exactly property of the café, but Rio would've pretended it was. So, they stood under a tree — searching for the right words.</p><p>It was Agatha who spoke first.</p><p>"Have you calmed down?"</p><p>Rio smiled as her mind made her remember when she had shut the door, in front of Agatha's face, blocking the entrance.</p><p>"Yeah, I did!" Rio replied, seeming to be in a chipper mood. Agatha couldn't help but reciprocate a timid yet powerful smile.</p><p>And again, silence surrounded them. Why was it so hard to speak? Rio glanced at Agatha, and she saw sadness in her eyes, as if she felt guilty to be there.</p><p>"Ms. Harkness–"</p><p>"Oh, drop the formalities. Just call me <em>Agatha</em>, 'Ms. Harkness' makes me feel older than usual."</p><p>Rio brightened up as she could feel her tension slowly leaving her body.</p><p>"Agatha," she said, her name spoken in such a soft way — Agatha couldn't help but feel happy, even if nothing had really happened, "I own you an apology, I was drunk and I shouldn't have forced you to whatever happened. I hope you'll forgive me, we may not know each other well, but, I'd hate if you felt uncomfortable around me."</p><p>Agatha was impressed — for her to have such maturity, and sense of fairness. How could she be angry at her? Truth to be told, she did think Rio was funny, when drunk, and rather audacious. She wished to know more about her.</p><p>"It's fine, really. It was actually pretty hilarious. I never thought you had it in you."</p><p>Rio laughed shyly, and Agatha could feel that she had, somehow, eased up the tension that was between them.</p><p>"Oh, Agatha. You have no idea of what I'm capable of."</p><p>That sentence had made Agatha think — what was Rio able to do? Sure, she thought she was charming, smart, and with an incredible determination. Perhaps a part of her wished for her to get closer to Rio, even if she didn't understand why.</p><p>A persistent thought kept appearing in her mind — what if she had deepened the connection with Rio? Of course, nothing would've happened. Maybe.</p><p>"Well, why don't you show me?"</p><p>Rio's lips were slightly parted, with a curious look in he eyes. "What are you suggesting, Agatha?"</p><p>"Well," Agatha pondered, even if she didn't quite know what to say — she was older than Rio, who would've wanted to go out with someone older than them? But, she so much wanted to say that thing that had been tormenting her, "I mean, we could go out sometimes. It doesn't have to be romantically, just as friends — I can see you're not that bad."</p><p>Rio didn't reply soon — and Agatha began regretting saying all of that. Of course, who would've wanted to go out with her? Even as friends, it might've seemed weird.</p><p>Agatha started to worry, as she didn't hear a reply. Maybe Rio was thinking of a way to turn her down and reject her.</p><p>"Actually, don't worry—"</p><p>"I would love to."</p><p>There was a smile on Rio's lips and a loving gaze in her eyes. "Where would you like to go, Agatha?"</p><p>And Agatha was incredulous — she thought she would've rejected her, but that seemed to not be the case. She seemed happy, satisfied even.</p><p>"I'm still deciding," she tried to play it cool, "I think it'd be better if we exchanged contacts so that I can tell you more details."</p><p>Rio laughed, and Agatha wondered why.</p><p>"It's funny — we are exchanging contacts before our Instagram!"</p><p>The older woman giggled softly, realising that it was weird — but she could've overlooked that weirdness.</p><p>"Yes, well–, you can follow me there. I don't care. Now, can I have your number?"</p><p>As they exchanged numbers, feeling many unspoken and new emotions, Agatha's phone began to rang — it was a phone call from her office, meaning that she had to go urgently.</p><p>She waved at Rio, telling her one last good–bye, before disappearing with hasty steps. Rio watched her go, as her heart felt heavier, her mind racing. What had just happened?</p><p>—</p><p>She had returned to the café, Alice waited her with her arms crossed. "Well? What did she say?"</p><p>Rio thought about lying — to save Agatha's reputation. "Nothing much, we just clarified our differences. I did a proper apology"</p><p>"Well, isn't that comforting?"</p><p>Rio stared at her phone, which now had Agatha's number on it.</p><p>"Yeah, it is."</p>

<p><em>A date with Agatha Harkness</em> — well, not really a date, more like a sort of 'hang out', because that's what Rio thought. Agatha didn't want romance, but, perhaps, just a friend. No, maybe not a friend? It was confusing, Agatha really didn't specify it.</p><p>Either way, they started talking over texts. It was fun — Rio would send memes, pictures of cats, or of the cappuccinos she would make, and, surprisingly, Agatha would reply with gifs or elaborated texts. She texted in such an old yet cute way, it was impossible for Rio to not find that adorable.</p><p>They decided on the time they would meet — around 8'00 pm, at the nearby park, and they would've gone to a restaurant that Rio had never heard about; <em>perhaps</em> Agatha was far more experienced in terms of places where to spend the time.</p><p>Alice saw that something was happening to Rio. She could see her smiling and laughing — and that only happened when she was playing her game or making fun of someone. But, she seemed to be texting? But who? Perhaps, it was better not to ask, she would've told her, eventually. She <em>knew</em> it.</p><p>It was around 7'00 pm when Rio had asked Alice to leave earlier for work — which surprised her. What was she up to?</p><p>"Of course, but why?"</p><p>Rio looked everywhere, but her eyes. "I need to do something, I think I'll also be late at home. Don't wait for me, okay?"</p><p>Alice didn't question or press the matter any further. She just gave a nod as she watched her go — running even. She didn't understand, but Rio seemed happy, and that's what mattered to her.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio spent minutes searching for the right clothes — in the end, she opted for something classy; a skirt, reaching her knees, and a shirt of the whitest colour, with jewellery and her hair down. She rarely used skirts. Perhaps — she wanted to impress Agatha?</p><p>She didn't know. But, she was running slightly late, luckily, the park happened to be near her home, she would've walked there.</p><p>So, she was out of her home; purse, phone, money were with her — she had used a unique perfume, hoping Agatha would've noticed that. Even if she didn't really know why she wanted Agatha to notice her, maybe she feared being seen as someone inferior, not <em>worthy</em>.</p><p>As her thoughts went deeper, she had reached the park — Agatha was nowhere to be seen. She thought of sending her a text, but suddenly, a red car — seeming to be an expensive one — had parked next to the entrance of the park, where Rio stood. Rio stared at the car. She had never been interested in cars or anything, but that car — it caught her attention.</p><p>After a while, the driver of the car appeared; it was Agatha — she was wearing a suit, with a black blazer and her hair were down, like Rio's. She looked around, only to spot Rio after, as she proceeded to walk towards her.</p><p>Rio could feel her heart sinking deeper and deeper into her ribcage. Sure, she had seen Agatha in suits, but this time, it was different — she seemed prettier than usual, more calm and composed.</p><p>"Oh, you're already here. Thought I had to wait for you," Agatha teased. She was standing in front of her — she wore heels, remarking the height difference between them, not that Rio minded, of course.</p><p>A smile appeared on Rio's lips — perhaps she had been panicking over nothing. It was a simple hang–out, and what Rio wanted the most was to make Agatha relax, smile, and enjoy the evening.</p><p>"Well—, couldn't make <em>the</em> Agatha Harkness wait. Don't you think?"</p><p>Agatha softly laughed as she rolled her eyes — not as a sign of annoyance. Rather, she thought of Rio as someone entertaining.</p><p>"Come now, let's go," Agatha made a gesture to Rio, that meant '<em>follow me</em>'. Rio followed her to the car — as Agatha had opened the passenger seat, waiting for Rio to enter.</p><p>"Are you sure you're not kidnapping me?"</p><p>Agatha tried hard to refrain herself from laughing at that pathetic joke — how could one even think about such a thing? Nevertheless, she attempted a smile that was better than laughing because she didn't want to show Rio that her weird jokes worked on her.</p><p>"Worry not. If I were to kidnap you, I should've had you tied up. Don't you think?"</p><p>Rio blushed shyly — as her mind wandered to an image of her, tied up, at her mercy, perhaps to a bed, as Agatha — wait, no, what was she thinking? She quickly shook her head, smiled at her, and closed the door. Her mind filled with (<em>impure</em>) thoughts of Agatha, who was supposed to be her friend? She had to smack some sense in herself.</p><p>She hoped for the car ride to be quick.</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha's driving skills were amazing — Rio had not even once seen her removing her eyes from the road, her hands still. They chatted for a while, but nothing too important to be mentioned — Rio feared distracting Agatha.</p><p>It was after a while when Rio began to speak.</p><p>"So, where are you taking me?"</p><p>"A kidnapper doesn't tell their victims where they are going," again, Agatha teased Rio — she seemed in a chipper mood, and Rio had never seen her like that. She was funny, hilarious.</p><p>"I see, as mysterious as always."</p><p>"Mystery makes things intriguing."</p><p>Rio gazed outside the window. She recognised the area — it was the rich neighbourhood of the city, and, if she was correct, there would've been a notorious restaurant there. But why was Agatha going to such lengths for Rio? A burger would've been fine, not a whole course of meals.</p><p>"It's fine — I'm a pro at solving mysteries."</p><p>"You took your sweet time figuring out who I was."</p><p>A reddish colour appeared on Rio's cheeks, while a smile made its appearance on her lips, showing off her canines — if Agatha teased her, she would've teased her back. At the right time.</p><p>"Can't reply to that."</p><p>Soon — they arrived, and Agatha parked the car perfectly. She got out of the vehicle only to open Rio's door, smiling while doing so. "Let's get in."</p><p>—</p><p>The restaurant was big, big enough to throw a whole party — but that wasn't the purpose of that place, Rio could see fancy, rich people there but she wasn't intimidated or scared, rather bored — but, Agatha was there, so things would've been fun.</p><p>Agatha walked as if she owned the place, and Rio couldn't help but smile — soon, a waiter greeted them, talking nervously to the duo (especially Agatha) as he led them to their table. The table was near a window, and Rio could see the stars, along with the moon.</p><p>They sat on their chairs — as the waiter hurried to bring the menù. Once there, Rio opened the menù and, oh, the food there was so pricey, so, so pricey. She would've used two months of her salary. But Rio didn't mind. The moonlight lingered on Agatha's visage, enlightening her lips and blue eyes. She stared at her, perhaps for too long.</p><p>"Don't worry — you can take whatever you like, I'm paying tonight."</p><p>"What?" Rio gasped, "I can't let you do that, I'm an <em>independent</em> woman!"</p><p>Agatha laughed. "It's my treat, I insist."</p><p>Rio knew that fighting back would've been useless, so — she accepted her kind request, knowing that she would've chosen the least pricey meal.</p><p>—</p><p>The meals came sooner than expected. Agatha had chosen a steak, along with vegetables, and Rio had a simple dish of pasta — the pasta was from a famous italian company — it seemed expensive, same for the meat.</p><p>Rio laughed, and Agatha wondered why.</p><p>"Is there something wrong?"</p><p>"No, no—, I just," Rio gazed at Agatha, with playful eyes, "I never thought of eating in a place like this, I'm used to something else."</p><p>"Where do you usually eat?"</p><p>Rio beamed up because Agatha seemed genuinely curious about her routines. "That hispanic restaurant, where we met — I usually go there, every time. I mean, it just feels like home."</p><p>Agatha didn't reply soon, and Rio thought of having said the wrong thing.</p><p>"What do you mean by '<em>home</em>'?"</p><p>"I have hispanic origins. That's what I meant."</p><p>Suddenly, there was a shocking expression on Agatha's face — betraying her seriousness. For a moment, she had even a smile on her lips.</p><p>"I had no idea. I love the language, the culture, the food! It's amazing—," Agatha talked and talked, for what seemed to be hours — the food started to go a little cold, and Rio couldn't help but find her beautiful, to show so much interest in her. Who had done that for her?</p><p>Agatha had realised how much she had spoken and suddenly shut her lips — feeling embarrassed, as she coughed a little. She stared at Rio, waiting for her to say something.</p><p>"Didn't know you liked my culture so much. Perhaps I <em>could</em> teach you some words." Rio smiled, trying to reassure Agatha — to let her know that she hadn't talked too long and that she could've talked all she wanted, Rio would've listened.</p><p>"The offer is intriguing, but can I ask you something else?"</p><p>Rio's eyes widened — curiosity hitting its peak.</p><p>"Sure. Go on."</p><p>Agatha felt a little afraid, but after taking a deep breath — she stared at Rio fiercely.</p><p>"You are smart, good with your words — you know more than one language, and you are far more talented than my employees," Agatha deepened her stare, "I just want to know why, with all of your abilities, you decided to work in a café. I mean, there's nothing wrong. But, you could aim higher."</p><p>Rio was speechless — had Agatha seriously brought this topic to the table? It seemed odd, out of place, but yet very real and important. In truth, Rio had given up on finding a better job because companies never even looked at her CV. So, she settled. It wasn't right. She knew, but nor was it wrong. But, either way, an answer awaited Agatha.</p><p>"I tried. I sent my CV everywhere," her words seemed confused, as she tried to put on a smile, "Alice—, my boss, she really saved me, when I was at my lowest. She offered me to work for her, and I accepted. I really did try, but without experience, it's hard."</p><p>Agatha frowned — it was true that the work environment was brutal, but she had hoped for things to have changed a little. How could younger people obtain experience without even giving them a chance?</p><p>"Have you tried applying to my company?"</p><p>Rio laughed a little — how could she even think of that? But Agatha looked serious, deadly serious.</p><p>"To be honest, I didn't. But I also didn't know you."</p><p>"You should try."</p><p>"Why? Are you going to give me a free pass?" Rio smiled, teasing her in such a carefree way. And Agatha smiled back, breaking the seriousness of before.</p><p>"Of course not — your CV will be seen by experts of these matters, they'll interview you, and they'll decide if you're in or not. I do not meddle with these things. That'll be cheating."</p><p>Rio giggled, only to stare at the dish. "I'll think about it."</p><p>Agatha didn't indulge any longer. They both started eating in complete silence.</p><p>—</p><p>After dinner, Agatha had paid for their meals. Turns out that the restaurant had made a special discount for Agatha Harkness, which reassured Rio a little. The pasta wasn't expensive, but she still felt bad about it. They were both outside, catching some fresh air.</p><p>Rio gazed at Agatha. She had to thank her in some way. So, she thought of something that never failed to cheer her up.</p><p>"Want to go get an ice cream? My treat, since you paid for me."</p><p>Agatha reciprocated the stare, only for a warm smile to appear on her lips — she seemed happy that Rio had proposed that.</p><p>"Sure, why not."</p><p>Rio looked around. Luckily enough, there was an ice cream shop near the restaurant where they had been — so, Rio began to walk towards the shop, followed by Agatha, who was slower than her, perhaps feeling nervous.</p><p>They entered the shop. Rio looked through the different flavours. There were many flavours she didn't recognise — Agatha stared at Rio, only to then look at the different kinds of ice creams. She appeared to be nostalgic, as if she had been there many times.</p><p>"Ladies," the man who appeared to own the place made his entrance, "have you decided?"</p><p>Rio pondered for a while. "I'll get the mint chocolate chip," she said, as her gaze shifted to Agatha, "what about you?"</p><p>Agatha laughed, and Rio didn't understand why.</p><p>"I'll get the black coffee."</p><p>That choice described Agatha perfectly.</p><p>The man scooped the ice cream, placing them on cones — they seemed to be tasty, the cones looked edible, and the ice creams were about to melt. Once done, Rio paid for them both, as they thanked the man and exited.</p><p>Agatha stared at the ice cream, and Rio stared at her.</p><p>"You really are coffee–obsessed," Rio teased her, with a smug on her lips, "I shouldn't be worried, should I?"</p><p>"You picked my son's favourite flavour. And I'm not the <em>one</em> judging here."</p><p>Rio laughed. She had never spoken about her son, and Rio didn't want to bring him up — not because it was some forbidden topic, but because Agatha was very reserved, and she feared getting her angry. Her son must've meant the whole world to her. She could see that she was a caring mother.</p><p>"Well, your son has good taste. It must've been nice to have such a smart boy."</p><p>"It is. Though, sometimes, it's irritating. As if he could read my mind."</p><p>"Must've taken it from you."</p><p>Agatha appreciated Rio's flattery. She simply smiled but didn't add anything else to that conversation — she looked around, spotting a nearby bench, as she went to point there.</p><p>"Shall we sit there?"</p><p>Rio nodded, and they started walking towards the bench.</p><p>—</p><p>The night was chilly — and the cold ice cream didn't help much with managing the temperature, Agatha seemed fine, so Rio would've pretended to be fine too.</p><p>Rio was enjoying her ice cream, trying not to think that her taste was similar to the ones of a kid, especially of Agatha's kid. To be honest, that flavour had always been Rio's favourite; she would always choose that flavour.</p><p>Agatha seemed to be immerse in her ice cream — which made Rio happy. Perhaps getting a dessert was a good idea.</p><p>"How's the black coffee?" Rio asked as she stared at Agatha, a hint of sarcasm in her voice.</p><p>"Want to give it a try?"</p><p>Rio didn't have to think twice — she <em>wanted</em> to try. So, she got closer to Agatha, leaning her head towards the ice cream, as her tongue stook out, while Agatha brought the ice cream closer to Rio's lips. Rio's tongue licked the coldy cream, slowly and steadily, at a pace that may have been misunderstood — her eyes met the one of Agatha's, the older woman seemed to be hypnotised by such movement, probably her too, though that it alluded to something else, something that was strictly done elsewhere — <em>a bedroom</em>, perhaps.</p><p>Agatha's cheeks were of a rosy colour. She didn't avert her eyes. How could she? The hand that was holding the cone suddenly tightened the grip. It was by then that Agatha had removed her eyes from Rio's tongue, and Rio had stopped licking it.</p><p>"<em>Tasty</em>." Rio managed to say, with a firm smile, knowing damn well what she had done — and Agatha didn't reply.</p><p>Agatha still didn't speak.</p><p>"Want to try <em>mine</em>?"</p><p>Obviously — Rio wasn't talking about the ice cream, or perhaps she was? There was a subtle innuendo, and Agatha had understood. But, after all, she could've really talked about ice creams.</p><p>So, she sighed. Her fears suddenly appeared in her mind — many thoughts, many doubts; her <em>age</em> being one of them. She was older than Rio, who would've done that?</p><p>"I think," Agatha bit her lip, "I think I'm <em>too old</em> for that flavour."</p><p>Rio stared at her — she had managed to catch a glimpse of her worries, what was tormenting her. Age played a huge factor, but it wasn't something Rio truly worried about. She wished for Agatha to be more confident of herself — she was amazing, and she should've known that.</p><p>"What are you saying? This flavour <em>doesn't</em> have an age limit — everyone can enjoy it, you're not too old for it," Rio smiled, "I think you shouldn't worry, I'm sure the ice cream doesn't mind it."</p><p>Agatha was shocked — only for her to smile, then laugh softly. And that reassured Rio.</p><p>"You're really something else."</p><p>"So I've been told," she replied quickly, "so, you don't want a taste of this flavour?"</p><p>"Not today — but thank you for the offer."</p><p>Rio didn't press any further. They sat in silence, eating ice cream — as the night watched over them.</p><p>—</p><p>It was getting late, and Agatha had told Rio that she should've gone home — and that she would've offered her a lift, Rio tried to persuade her, but she had already made up her mind. So, Rio had to accept her offer, telling her to stop at the nearby park, since her house was in the neighbourhood.</p><p>The car trip was quiet, Rio was lost in her mind, thinking of why she had done such bold, straightforward thing — licking her ice cream, looking at her in the eyes, saying she wasn't old for that flavour? Just, what was she thinking, and why was she acting like a teen; full of hormones and nasty innuendos.</p><p>Agatha was also silent, rather focused on the road, and when they arrived at destination, she got out of the car, only to open Rio's passenger seat.</p><p>They stared at each other, there was something left unsaid — Rio was embarrassed for how assertive she had been, and Agatha was simply scared of what would've come next.</p><p>Rio managed to think of something — and say it.</p><p>"It was nice, I had fun. Thank you for driving me home."</p><p>Agatha smiled. "No worries. It's the least I can do."</p><p>There it was again — the awkwardness, the shyness, Rio couldn't stand it. She hated restricting herself but detested seeing Agatha doing the same. It was only an hang out, sure, it had taken strange turns, but nothing too tragic.</p><p>"Hey," Agatha continued, "I think you should apply for my company. It's well known amongst people with no experience; we practically form new people and guide them into the world. It's a start," she leaned toward her, but not too close, "only if you want to."</p><p>Rio thought that she was right — that she needed to change her life, she couldn't have worked in a café forever. She had dreams and expectations.</p><p>"Yeah, I think I'll do it."</p><p>Agatha recomposed herself, not knowing what to say next. She wasn't bribing Rio. She simply wanted what's best for her — and she knew that she was smart. She deserved better.</p><p>"Oh, and Agatha," Rio was now taking the leads of the conversation, "don't believe that the mint chocolate chip is too old for you — have some faith in yourself, your age doesn't limit you in any way, you can be old and still experience some interesting life lessons."</p><p>A smile appeared on Agatha's lips, proceeded by a tender laugh — Rio loved to see her like this, without any worries or without any masks to hide behind. Just herself, just Agatha.</p><p>"Thank you, <em>Rio</em>."</p><p>It was rare of Agatha to say her name, and Rio couldn't help but feel her heart flutter. She felt good, happy even.</p><p>"Don't mention it," Rio looked at the time on her phone, almost 12'30 am, "I'm sorry, but I have to go. Again, thank you for the ride."</p><p>"Thank you for this wonderful evening. We must re–do something like this."</p><p>Rio smiled as she waved at Agatha while speeding towards her house — she hoped for Alice to be asleep, desperately hoped so.</p><p>Agatha stared at her go — feeling as if something was amiss.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio had arrived home, she quietly opened the door, only to get inside fast, and walked to the kitchen — as she turned on the lights.</p><p>"Rio <em>fucking</em> Vidal."</p><p>Alice's voice — she was in her pyjamas, eyes almost shut. And Rio rolled her eyes.</p><p>"Alice. I told you <em>not</em> to wait for me."</p><p>"You were gone for almost five hours. You expected me not to worry?"</p><p>"I'm an adult."</p><p>Alice stood up, only to get closer to her.</p><p>"Where were you?"</p><p>"Protecting the city."</p><p>Rio smiled — Alice wanted to kill her.</p><p>"Ok, you obviously don't want to talk. That's fine," Alice crossed her arms, "Rio, don't do anything reckless. I won't always be there to save you."</p><p>And just like that, Alice walked to her room — shutting the door, leaving Rio in the kitchen, alone.</p><p>Rio sat on the chair, her hands holding her phone. '<em>Reckless</em>', what Rio was doing was very reckless, but she couldn't stop — she didn't want to.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Three days had passed since her 'date' with Agatha Harkness — Rio wouldn't exactly call it date, but not hang–out either. Perhaps an incredibly <em>sexual</em> 'gal pals' evening? But with moments of seriousness and bonding times.</p><p>She didn't truly know.</p><p>What made it worse was that Agatha had not (once) gone to the café — not even for her usual coffee. Sure, they had texted (almost every day), but something felt different. Agatha seemed distant — her responses were dry. Occasionally, she would answer, but later than usual. Which made Rio angry. What had happened in such a short time? Why was she distancing herself?</p><p>Time never seemed to flow in the café — the days were boring. But, she had not forgotten about Agatha's proposal. In fact, she had sent her CV to her company, and two days had already passed, Rio didn't receive an answer — but she knew how these things worked; days would've turned to months, months to years, and she wouldn't have gotten the position.</p><p>Rio had already given up.</p><p>Suddenly — a very familiar face had entered the café. Redhead, soft lineaments; Wanda had entered. And when she saw Rio, she couldn't help but smile as she walked closer to her.</p><p>"Rio! It's lovely to see you here."</p><p>"Oh Wanda," Rio had almost forgotten about her, and the promise she had made about a special discount, thinking back, why had she done that? "What brings you here?"</p><p>"Oh, Agatha sent me. She wants a cappuccino!"</p><p>"Wait. You work with her?"</p><p>Wanda laughed quietly. "Yes, she hasn't told you?"</p><p>Rio tried to keep on a smile, but she was hurt to have misunderstood their whole relationship — she had been jealous of Wanda, and she felt stupid to have done that. She sighed deeply, making Wanda worrying for her.</p><p>"No, she hasn't," Rio rolled her eyes, "Wanda, can you tell me why she didn't come here and sent you instead?"</p><p>Perhaps she had said something rude; she hurried to correct herself.</p><p>"Not that I <em>don't</em> enjoy your company, I—"</p><p>"You <em>miss</em> her, Rio?"</p><p>Her lips were shut, but her whole face gave Wanda the answer she needed. Her cheeks were red, and her eyes looked everywhere, but at Wanda's. She really did miss her a lot. Which was stupid because they texted, but Rio knew that it wasn't enough. The feelings she had for Agatha were deeper than she had initially thought, and that was no longer deniable. Did she like her? Well, 'like' was a strong word — perhaps, it was a simple infatuation.</p><p>"Don't worry," Wanda brought her back to that moment, "I'm sure she misses you too."</p><p>"Yeah, right. She barely replies to my texts."</p><p>"Oh, that–," Wanda bit her lower lip, "Agatha's mom, our ex CEO, is back in town. She's at our office, and when she's around, Agatha gets pretty, annoyed? Yes, let's say annoyed."</p><p>Rio had never heard of her mother before — she thought of her as someone strict, more rigid than Agatha. But for her not to reply to her texts, something must've happened between them. It wasn't Rio's business, but she hated the thought of Agatha being sad, not after the lovely night they had spent together.</p><p>"I didn't know."</p><p>"That's fine — Agatha doesn't like talking about it, I shouldn't have mentioned you either. But, she cares, in her own ways."</p><p>Suddenly — a notification popped on Rio's phone. It was weird because she would usually put her phone in silent mode, which meant one thing: she had received an email, an answer from the company. She jumped on her feet, and Wanda looked at her, understanding.</p><p>Rio took her phone, trembling. Opening her emails, clicking immediately. She read, carefully — she smiled, laughed even. The company had set an interview on that day, at 5'30 pm. It was an odd time for an interview, but Rio couldn't complain — finally, she had made a little step further.</p><p>"Shit—, Wanda, I got an interview at your company!"</p><p>"Oh, you applied?"</p><p>"Yeah! God, okay. Okay, I don't have to mess it up."</p><p>Wanda reassured Rio, placing a hand on her shoulder. "You'll do great. Maybe we'll be coworkers!"</p><p>Rio smiled, beaming at that comment. Not only what Wanda had said was true, but she would also have had Agatha as her boss.</p><p>"Yeah–, I'm feeling hopeful. Oh, anyway, let me prepare you a cappuccino."</p><p>"Oh, right— I almost forgot."</p><p>As she proceeded to make the drink, her mind wandered to Alice; what would she have told her? She felt bad at the idea of quitting her job, especially when Alice had helped her so much throughout her life. She would've dealt with that later. Rio had to focus on the nearby meeting.</p><p>She handed the coffee to Wanda, but not without drawing a heart on the top of the cappuccino — she was smiling, things would've taken a good turn. As she so much wished for.</p><p>—</p><p>It was 5'00 pm when Rio stood before the entrance of the company — she had told Alice that she had to take care of some things, and she had believed her. She felt bad for lying, but she would've told the truth soon.</p><p>Rio wore black trousers, a shirt and a black blazer; thin make–up, and her hair tied up in a ponytail. She even wore a tie, reminiscing how Agatha used to dress. So, with enough courage, she had entered the place.</p><p>She soon spotted a reception, and she walked over there.</p><p>Rio noticed a girl who was lazily doing her work — she didn't know or wanted to know why. She smiled at her as she tapped on the desk, trying to catch her attention.</p><p>"Hello! I'm here for the job interview."</p><p>The girl sighed. "Your name?"</p><p>"<em>Rio Vidal</em>."</p><p>She then proceeded to type something on her computer — the sound of her fingers was fast, and Rio thought of how scary it was.</p><p>"Take the elevator. On the second floor, walk towards the end of the hallway — you'll see a door, there's 'conference room' written on it. Knock, <em>always</em> knock. If they answer, you go in."</p><p>Rio thanked her — her journey finally beginning. The elevator had a mirror in it, and Rio stared at her reflection longer than usual. She wanted to look good — she hoped for her to meet Agatha, but that was a selfish desire. Once on the second floor, she walked towards the door. Once there, she knocked — and a female voice had replied.</p><p>"Come on in."</p><p>And Rio entered — there was a woman, much older than she had expected. She smiled and went to shake hands with her. Confidence was the key.</p><p>"Rio Vidal. Thank you for the opportunity."</p><p>The woman smiled, reciprocating the shake.</p><p>"I'm Lilia Calderu. I'll be interviewing you. Please, have a seat."</p><p>—</p><p>The interview went better than any other interviews she had done. Lilia was kind, a pure soul, and she hadn't done a single tricky question. Pure honesty and fair treatment.</p><p>"Alright, Ms. Vidal," Lilia stood up from her chair, "I'm very satisfied. We'll let you know our answer soon. But, before you go, would you like a tour of the workplace? We always do it whenever someone wants to work here."</p><p>Rio nodded, and that made Lilia smile.</p><p>"There should be an employee waiting for you outside. Let's go, I'll introduce you to her." Lilia walked towards the door, opening it slowly — and Rio recognised the person who would've given her a tour.</p><p>"Ms. Vidal, this is–"</p><p>"–<em>Jen</em>?!"</p><p>"<em>Rio</em>?!"</p><p>Lilia shook her head, examining the situation before her eyes. "You two know each other?"</p><p>"Yes, Mrs. Calderu! We are friends. She didn't tell me she wanted to work here–," Jen sounded offended, Rio could understand, "I mean–, not that I mind. Of course."</p><p>"Well, isn't that nice? Having friends is important, especially in a place like this. You have to help one another," Lilia smiled, "now go, both of you."</p><p>Jen nodded, and so did Rio — as they walked towards the elevator. Rio knew Jen would've scolded her, but she wasn't nervous about that. She was more concerned if they ran into Agatha. How would she have reacted?</p><p>—</p><p>"Does Alice know?"</p><p>Rio and Jen were in the elevator. They were heading to the higher floor of the palace, where Jen worked, and where Rio would've worked too — if she was accepted. Doing paperwork and such.</p><p>"No–, I mean <em>not</em> yet."</p><p>"Rio, are you fucking stupid?"</p><p>Rio laughed even if she knew she shouldn't have done that — Jen was already angry at her, it was better not to tease her any further.</p><p>"Come on, I'm going to tell her tonight."</p><p>"Sometimes, I wonder why she protects you so much. You should get a good scolding," Jen sighed, "Rio, why did you even apply here?"</p><p>Soon, they had arrived to the floor. Rio quickly stepped out of the elevator, followed by Jen. There was a tense, thick tension between the duo — but, for Jen's sake, she decided to drop it.</p><p>"Follow me — don't go around without my permission. After this tour, you're going home. Is that clear?"</p><p>"Yes, ma'am."</p><p>Jen sighed even more. The two entered in the office — it was large, larger than any office Rio had seen (on TV). She looked around, there were many people there. Some had noticed Rio, others were too caught up in their work.</p><p>Her chaperone began walking, explaining the various types of work that they did — from the interesting ones, to the boring ones. Rio listened, well, at least tried to. She constantly gazed everywhere, hoping to spot Agatha.</p><p>After half an hour of explorations — Rio saw her, Agatha; she looked tired, as she was a lifeless body walking without a destination. What had happened?</p><p>Rio, as she ignored Jen's words, got closer to Agatha — her hand taking her wrist, she held her gently and without pressure, but Agatha had leapt back and turned around immediately.</p><p>"<em>Agatha</em>!"</p><p>Everyone was silent — Rio could've swore that she had never heard such silence before, not even at funerals. Everyone's eyes were on her, and Jen rushed to Rio, slapping her hand as a way of freeing Agatha from Rio's grip.</p><p>"Gosh. Ms. Harkness–, forgive me. I'm showing her around! I must've let my guard down. I'm so sorry, it won't happen again!"</p><p>Rio didn't understand — why was she apologising? She had not done anything too atrocious. Rio simply grabbed Agatha by her wrist. Maybe she could've chosen another way of stopping her, but she acted on impulse.</p><p>"<em>Kale</em>," Agatha's face was unreadable, "I will let it pass. But, make sure that something like this doesn't happen again–, or there'll be consequences. I don't have time to waste."</p><p>Jen didn't reply — and Agatha stared coldly at Rio; Rio felt her heart crushed. Why was Agatha acting as if she didn't know her existence? It hurt.</p><p>"Rio, not only are you stupid, but also crazy!"</p><p>As expected, Jen scolded Rio — but Rio couldn't take her eyes off Agatha, who was walking away from her. She felt sad, angry, and disappointed.</p><p>Rio listened to Jen — but not really.</p><p>—</p><p>After the tour, as Jen had told her, she returned home. Her thoughts were all about Agatha. She hated it — how easily she would appear in her mind. She wasn't angry, of course not, but rather confused.</p><p>Maybe she shouldn't have grabbed her in front of everyone. She should've ignored her. But why? She knew her, she couldn't pretend she didn't.</p><p>Alice wasn't home when Rio returned — she went to her room and laid on the bed. Gazing at the wall of her room, when, suddenly, a notification appeared; an email.</p><p>It was weird. Who could be?</p><p>She went to open it — to her surprise, it was from the company. Maybe she hadn't been accepted, since the reply came way sooner than expected.</p><p>Reading through it made her doubts fly away; she had been taken — starting from tomorrow, she would've started working.</p><p>Luckily, tomorrow was also her resting day at the cafe — she would've lied to Alice until the inevitable truth came out.</p><p>She sighed.</p><p>"I hope you're <em>proud</em> of me, Agatha."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The following day — Rio's <em>first</em> day at work — had already started in a chaotic way; Rio and Alice had discussed over the fact that Rio would've been away the whole day (she was unaware of her new job), and that she owned her an explanation — and Rio had agreed to that, she would've told her everything, after she had returned home. So, she was scared of getting home — she wished for the time to stop, even if she would've been stuck in the office.</p><p>Her supervisor had assigned her a seat; she was right next to Jen, which made Rio laugh, even if she had tried to hide it. The work was fine, since she was new, people had given her easy tasks — such as reviewing calculations, talking to clients via phone and, sometimes, even fixing other's stuff.</p><p>She didn't have a specific role. She just did whatever they told her — but Rio specialised in mathematics, calculus, and thinking related things. So, she was disappointed to have been lowered to do something so trivial. Rio could've handled the finances of the company, but no, she was stuck making coffee or something even more useless.</p><p>But, incredibly enough — Rio had already made a few friends, including Jen. Her coworkers were funny, sometimes a bit dumb, but Rio could've overlooked that.</p><p>It was lunch break. Rio could've gone to the cafeteria, but she had decided to remain in the office; there were other two girls who had become friends of hers. The break was fine, Rio didn't bring any food, but the girls were willing to share — which made her smile.</p><p>She had wondered where Agatha was — she hadn't replied to her texts, nor seen her around. Rio felt incredibly sad, but what hurt more was not being able to talk about it.</p><p>"She's still in her office," the girl, whose name Rio had not bothered to remember, looked towards the big room that was at the centre of the office, "I wonder if she ever gets tired."</p><p>She was talking about Agatha, definitely.</p><p>"Come on! She's on lunch break with the superiors — she is human, she <em>gets</em> tired!"</p><p>"Is she really?"</p><p>The duo began to laugh — Rio couldn't stand it, she rolled her eyes and sighed. What did they even know about Agatha? Agatha was caring, full of doubts, and questions that needed an answer — not to mention her intelligence and sense of justice. Rio realised how in trouble she would've been if she had let those feelings deepened, if she had thought about her more than she should've. Her heart ached. She didn't want to hear that talk; Agatha was human, more than anything they could ever be.</p><p>"<em>Shut up.</em>"</p><p>The girl looked at the other one — silence surrounded them; Rio looked over the room. She couldn't storm in, but nor could she do anything else. But, something happened, Wanda had walked out of the room and soon spotted Rio — she walked towards her, waving calmy as the two girls behind her froze on the spot.</p><p>"Vidal! I've been searching for you," Wanda smiled, "I'm glad you got in. Can I ask you a tiny favour? We're working, even during break, could you bring us three black coffees?"</p><p>Rio looked at Wanda; she seemed exhausted. She had never seen her in that state — she was usually so full of energies. The least Rio could do was agree to her request, as she began walking to the cafeteria, the two girls staring at her.</p><p>—</p><p>After minutes of waiting, Rio had gotten the drinks — she was having a hard time balancing the three drinks she held in her hands. She had to be extremely careful, but that would've been hard since Agatha was in that room, and they hadn't spoken in days. Things had gotten complicated.</p><p>She knocked — somehow — at the door, and Wanda opened it; she entered the room, and she saw her, Agatha Harkness, deeply focused on her work, at her side there was Lilia Calderu, so Wanda must've been the other superior. Agatha didn't seem to have noticed Rio there, she was so concentrated on the paperwork.</p><p>Rio smiled at Wanda, then she proceeded to walk towards the desk — the plan was to slam the drinks on the desk so that Agatha would've lifted her gaze, then looked at her.</p><p>The plan was simple, with no complications. Or so she thought. Rio had, accidentally, tripped on something — the balance she was keeping was weak, the drink had flown from her hands, they flew and flew, until they landed, not on the ground, but the liquid spilt on Agatha's shirt; the white of the fabric was immediately ruined by the brown, intoxicating fluid.</p><p>Rio froze. She was on the ground — her knees hurt, but that was nothing compared to the fury that Agatha was feeling. Luckily, the paper was left untouched.</p><p>"Rio—," Wanda rushed to help her stand up, "I hope you're okay! That fall was nasty."</p><p>It was <em>admiring</em> to see Wanda more worried about her, rather than Agatha — Lilia was beside her, as she observed the whole situation. But Agatha hadn't said anything.</p><p>"I'm so sorry—," Rio felt her blood turning cold, as if nothing would've saved her from that situation.</p><p>"It's okay, accidents happen, Ri—"</p><p>"Vidal," Agatha had finally spoken, the first words she had told her after days of silence — Rio felt weird, her voice had not a hint of anger, she was just tired. "Come with me," she stood up and walked past Lilia and Wanda.</p><p>"Where?"</p><p>"The storage; there are unused pairs of shirt, you're helping me find one. Follow me."</p><p>Rio looked at Wanda, then at Lilia — they had concerning looks on their faces, and Rio couldn't figure out if she would've died in the storage room, or perhaps a little later than that.</p><p>Nonetheless, she followed Agatha.</p><p>—</p><p>The walk towards the storage was quiet — Rio wanted to say many things, but Agatha obviously wasn't in the mood for talks, even more small talks. She thought of apologising, but that wouldn't have worked either.</p><p>So, when they reached the room, entering in it — Rio was astonished to see how big and well furnished that storage was. This company had so many secrets.</p><p>"It's going to take a while, huh?" Rio cracked a joke, alluding to how big the storage was — in the vein hopes of making Agatha laugh, even for a short while. But nothing, nothing had happened.</p><p>Agatha barely looked at her. "That's why I need help. You better start — I'll look left."</p><p>Then, she closed the door. Rio didn't reply. What could she have said? Agatha seemed to have forgotten everything — and it hurt; but what hurt even more was how Agatha wasn't capable of looking at her, as if she was scared.</p><p>After minutes of silence, as they were both searching for a shirt (they opened many lockers, but nothing had appeared), Rio couldn't take it anymore.</p><p>"Agatha, <em>what's</em> going on?"</p><p>Agatha stopped for a while; her fingers lingered on a locker — she tried searching for the right words.</p><p>"We're searching for a shirt; you ruined mine. <em>That's</em> what's going on."</p><p>"Bullshit," Rio rarely swore; she proceeded to get closer to Agatha, but she hadn't turned around — she simply stared at the locker, her back facing Rio.</p><p>"That's what's happening, though."</p><p>"Oh, really? Then, why can't you even look at me?"</p><p>Agatha tightened the grip on the locker. She didn't reply. She simply breathed in and out; hoping for Rio to calm down.</p><p>"It's wrong."</p><p>"What's wrong?" Rio insisted; and she had never been so serious in her whole life, probably not even during her studies.</p><p>"This is wrong. You work for me; I'm your boss, and there are lines that are never meant to be crossed — rules to be <em>respected</em>, duties that must be <em>done</em>."</p><p>Rio could hear Agatha's voice cracking — she tried hard not to let a sob out. But still, she didn't turn around to face Rio.</p><p>The realisation came to Rio; blood flowing faster, hands trembling — she had understood why her heart ached, why she missed Agatha, and why her mind was full of thoughts of her. It wasn't an infatuation. It was something more — she wanted to see her happy, she would've died trying. Agatha was someone who deserved that. She liked her — she liked her, and that was no longer deniable.</p><p>"I want to cross that line; I want to break that rules, and I don't care about duties, because," Rio smiled, as she went to take Agatha's hand, holding it gently, "I want to do that, to risk it for you."</p><p>"I could get you fired for even thinking that," Agatha whispered, but not quietly enough — Rio had heard it, and her fingers intertwined with hers.</p><p>"Say it—, say it while facing me."</p><p>It was then that Agatha had turned around to face Rio — her eyes were watery, her nose wrinkled and red; she was trying her best not to cry.</p><p>"I could get you fired for even thinking that."</p><p>She had really said it; Rio laughed softly.</p><p>"<em>Fire me</em>," her thumb caressed the hand of Agatha. She had never imagined her skin to be so soft, yet so vulnerable. "I only applied here to work with you, anyway."</p><p>"You <em>can't</em> be serious."</p><p>But Rio was serious, in part — she had applied because she wanted a change, but also to be closer to Agatha; even if she had never imagined to say it out loud, she thought that it would've remained in her mind.</p><p>"I am."</p><p>"You're really something."</p><p>Agatha laughed; as she went to dry her eyes, she felt ashamed to have almost let Rio see that side of her — she had to be careful.</p><p>Rio stared at Agatha's lips; her lipstick was of a redder colour, more colourful than usual — had she changed brand? She didn't know, but wanted to know.</p><p>"Agatha," she got closer to her; tiptoeing to make the height difference disappear, and Agatha's heartbeat increased — she remembered Rio doing something similar when she had been drunk at the pub.</p><p>The older woman seemed hypnotised by her — the way she was gently holding her hand, how her eyes looked at her lips, and then at her eyes.</p><p>"Your lipstick is so pretty."</p><p>"Are you really talking about my lipstick?"</p><p>Rio giggled; perhaps she hadn't been so subtle as she imagined.</p><p>"No, not really. I wonder if this colour suits me too."</p><p>Agatha's other hand went on Rio's waist, pulling her closer; bodies touching, as they both felt a sudden rush of adrenaline.</p><p>"You can try it."</p><p>A few inches divided them — Rio would've closed the distance, as she pushed Agatha against the lockers.</p><p>"I won't get fired?" Rio teased, but Agatha didn't reply — perhaps, she was conflicted about this. But, her emotions, desires, were having the best on; it always happened when she was with Rio.</p><p>Without any further, <em>useless</em> talks; Rio's lips met Agatha's, melting in a kiss. Her lips were soft, and the lipstick was of a fruity flavour — Rio had the lead, and she was hungry, starving of Agatha. Tongues fought against one another; Rio was fierce, and Agatha let out a few moans, sounds that only fueled Rio's will to touch her further.</p><p>"<em>Rio</em>..." Agatha moaned her name in her mouth — and that only made Rio's mind go numb; her weak voice, the trembling and the desire to go harder.</p><p>Her leg went between Agatha's thighs — her knee pushing on her clit, and— suddenly, someone knocked on the door.</p><p>Agatha returned to her senses, and so did Rio. Who had immediately distanced herself from Agatha — they stared at each other, her cheeks burning; the fear of getting caught increasing.</p><p>"Ms. Harkness—, Mrs. Calderu sent me to know your whereabouts. You've been away for a long time," it was a girl, Rio couldn't figure out who it was.</p><p>"Yes—, tell her that I'll be back in a few minutes."</p><p>Sound of steps walking away; Rio and Agatha breathed in relief.</p><p>"Rio, help me find a shirt."</p><p>She didn't protest; she simply did as she was told — after a while of throwing stuff on the floor, she had found it, only to give it to Agatha.</p><p>"Here," she handed it to her, smiling while doing so.</p><p>Agatha didn't manage to look at her.</p><p>"Come to my office when your turn ends; we need to talk properly," Agatha went to unbutton her shirt, and Rio stared really, really hard — without even hiding it, being shamelessly.</p><p>"You can go, lunch break is over."</p><p>Rio had been caught; she simply nodded and left the room. Her hands went to hit her head — had she really kissed Agatha, making her do that noises? She wanted to hear more, to have more. She walked fast to her seat, hoping that walking would've calmed her down — her hands cleaning the stains of her lipstick.</p><p>—</p><p>Hours went on — Rio counted every single minute; her turn was about to end, it was early evening, and everyone had almost left the place. Jen walked towards Rio, as she went to tap gently her shoulder.</p><p>"Want to walk home together?"</p><p>Rio smiled. "Maybe next time, the boss needs to talk to me."</p><p>"Uh–oh, are you in trouble?"</p><p>'Trouble'? She really didn't know; she didn't feel uneasy or scared — rather, worried about how their relationship would've changed, they did kiss, after all.</p><p>"Nah."</p><p>Jen forced a smile. "Alright. See you, and good luck!"</p><p>When everyone had left (and Rio had made sure of it), she knocked on Agatha's door — and she got in, without even waiting for her reply. She had been eagerly waiting for this; a bit too much.</p><p>"Agatha," she chuckled, as she got closer to her; Agatha sat on the chair, she was revising some paperwork — couldn't and shouldn't be distracted, but that was Rio's purpose. "You <em>wanted</em> to talk?"</p><p>Agatha stood up from her chair, walking towards Rio; her eyes were firm, challenging the younger ones — but there wasn't anything that Rio loved more than challenges.</p><p>"Yes," Agatha replied, "Rio, we should <em>stop</em> whatever is going on."</p><p>"Do you want to stop?"</p><p>Agatha looked away. Did she want to?</p><p>"It doesn't matter what I want — what matters is what's right."</p><p>Rio got closer to her; Agatha felt weak, useless and completely gone — her senses were altered, and her body was telling her things she couldn't ever have done.</p><p>"That's not what I said; Agatha, do you <em>want</em> to stop?"</p><p>The distance between them was almost invisible — but Agatha had heard sounds of steps, quick and loud steps; she had pushed Rio away, the door had opened and—, a kid entered.</p><p>Rio was speechless. What was a kid doing there? The company couldn't be doing secret child labour or anything of that sort. She stared at him — he was oddly familiar, as if she had seen him somewhere.</p><p>"Mama!"</p><p>'<em>Mama</em>'? Wait, Agatha's son? Rio froze on the spot — she could feel a pressure she had never felt before; she couldn't quite figure out.</p><p>"Nicky—," she rushed to him, positioning a hand over his hair. "What are you doing here? Where's your babysitter?"</p><p>"Mama, you're mean! I don't like her–, Lilia is way better!"</p><p>Agatha sighed. "Lilia has to work, honey."</p><p>Soon, the so–called babysitter had entered the room. She looked so panicked, so scared; Rio couldn't help but restrain herself from laughing.</p><p>"Ms. Harkness–! He wanted to go for a walk, and he lead me here! He tricked me! And he managed to get here. It happened so fast!"</p><p>The girl was on the verge of tears.</p><p>"You're too slow."</p><p>"Nicholas!" Agatha scolded him; then her gaze went on the poor babysitter, "Nicky is like that–, but you can go home now. I'll take it from here."</p><p>The babysitter nodded and immediately ran away from the office — hoping that Agatha wouldn't have fired her (she would've, probably).</p><p>Once they were alone, the three of them — Agatha let out a sigh of pure desperation; Nicholas looked around, only to spot Rio, who was awkwardly standing there, without saying a word.</p><p>Nicholas beamed up at seeing her, as she rushed to her.</p><p>"Hi, pretty lady!"</p><p>Rio smiled; she wasn't used to kids complimenting her — usually, kids found her intimidating, creepy. Who knows how those little minds worked.</p><p>"You can run really fast, huh?"</p><p>Nicholas laughed. "Yes!"</p><p>"We should do a race, one day; I definitely can run faster than you."</p><p>Agatha tried not to laugh — why was Rio teasing him? But Nicholas didn't seem to mind. He was smiling widely.</p><p>"What's your name, pretty lady?"</p><p>"Rio, yours?"</p><p>"I'm Nicholas! But my friends call me Nicky, so you can call me that!"</p><p>"Are we <em>friends</em> then?"</p><p>Nicholas's smile widened even more — revealing that he had a missing tooth; which Rio found so in character for him.</p><p>"Of course!" Nicholas took Rio's finger, "I've always wanted a friend that can run!"</p><p>"Your dream came true."</p><p>Agatha felt warmness — an unexplainable feeling; seeing Rio and Nicky get along, she was happy, smiling at that funny scene. Her cheeks were rosy, and her mind eased up.</p><p>"Come on, Nicky— let's go home."</p><p>"Mama, I'm mad at you."</p><p>She knew what that meant — and how that kid of hers always was able to get what he wanted.</p><p>"Will an ice cream make you less angry at mama?"</p><p>Nicholas let go of Rio's finger, as he ran to Agatha, hugging her; and she couldn't help but pat his head, lovingly. After a while, Nicholas had lifted his head, looking at Agatha.</p><p>"Can Rio come with us?"</p><p>Agatha smiled. "I'm sure Rio is busy—"</p><p>"Not really," a lie, she had to talk to Alice, but that could wait. "I'm also craving an ice cream."</p><p>"Oh please! I want Rio to come with us!"</p><p>Agatha was speechless; her son was so persistent, and she felt guilty.</p><p>"Please, Agatha," Rio teased, "<em>Mama</em> Agatha!"</p><p>Rio was <em>playing</em> with fire — but she knew that Agatha couldn't have said anything, since Nicholas was there.</p><p>"Rio! You can't call her 'Mama', only I can!"</p><p>"How should I call her, Nicky?"</p><p>Nicholas pondered for a while — only for an idea to appear in his mind; he smiled, again.</p><p>"You can call her '<em>mommy</em>'! That's what my classmates use!"</p><p>Rio lowered her gaze; her cheeks were rosy, and a smirk appeared on the lips. "<em>Mommy Agatha</em>?"</p><p>Agatha glared Rio — but she couldn't hide the embarrassment she was feeling, that silly word didn't mean anything, but Rio knew exactly what she was doing. She was being sly.</p><p>"If you call me that again, I'm getting you no ice cream."</p><p>"<em>Nooo</em>! Rio don't do that again!"</p><p>Rio laughed — and soon, they started walking towards the exit of the company.</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha didn't know how it happened; the three of them sat on a bench, Nicholas was in between them, Rio on his left while Agatha on his right — because there would've been no way that Agatha would've sat next to Rio, but Nicholas didn't seem to mind, or think anything out of it.</p><p>Of course — who would've thought that the woman she had <em>made out</em> with hours ago, was now eating an ice cream, with her son, while acting as if nothing had happened, unfazed. Agatha wished for Rio to be as conflicted as she was, but, the reality was far more absurd; Rio was focused on the ice cream, of the same flavour of her son. She had the tastes of a kid, but Agatha found it cute — even if she couldn't be thinking that.</p><p>Rio, who was unaware of how intense Agatha was staring, looked at Nicholas — what did you talk about with kids? Work? No, perhaps not. Love life? Definitely not.</p><p>"So, Nicky–, how was school?"</p><p>Nicholas removed his eyes from the ice cream, only to look at Rio; she could've sensed that he liked to talk, as he was happy that she had asked that question.</p><p>"It was okay! Mrs. Hart made us do a drawing about families, she said that a special day about family was coming – I did a drawing for mom, but–," Nicholas appeared distant for a moment, "some of my friends made fun of me!"</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha; it was now her turn to speak.</p><p>"Why did they do that, honey?"</p><p>"They said my drawing <em>missed</em> a dad."</p><p>Agatha's eyes widened — and Rio noticed how quickly her behaviour changed, how the shift of her posture became more, and more closed. She tried her best to smile, but Nicholas wasn't sad or anything — he was just retelling his day.</p><p>"Well, they are wrong," Rio's hand went on Nicholas's head, ruffling his hair, "I think dads are useless; my dad does nothing but watch TV, and talk about sports. It's so boring."</p><p>"I don't care if I don't have a dad; my mom is super cool, and she's the best!"</p><p>A smile appeared on Rio's lips; this kid wasn't so bad — her eyes shifted to Agatha, who had teary eyes, even if she tried hard to not show it.</p><p>"Nicky, can you go get me a bottle of water? You can ask to the ice cream shop, I'll be watching from here!" Rio asked, and Nicky stood up immediately — he ate the last part of his ice cream, and ran towards the shop.</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha — but she didn't. She couldn't reciprocate the look — as if something was blocking her. Shame, guilt? She didn't know.</p><p>"Want to talk about it?"</p><p>Agatha sighed. "There's <em>nothing</em> much to say; his dad abandoned me while I was pregnant — and I've never heard of him since."</p><p>Rio saddened at hearing that; how could one abandon Agatha? She was a woman of many incredible qualities — abandoning her seemed to be something only someone mad would do. It was hard to understand, but that was her reality; Agatha's reality.</p><p>"Does he often ask about him?"</p><p>"He did in the past — but now, he seems to not have that many questions. But, I promised him that I'll tell him everything, he just has to grow a little more."</p><p>The atmosphere had become serious; Nicholas was still away — Rio thought of asking more questions; but she didn't want to make some bad memories emerge.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Agatha."</p><p>"Don't be — it's not that I liked him; I don't like men, I just was forced to date them," Agatha was opening up, and Rio could sense a change between them, "I mean, my mother would probably kill me if she saw me with a woman; that's why I was forced."</p><p>Her mother — Rio remembered Wanda telling her that Agatha's most sensible topic was her mother; but, for her to be talking about it, must've meant that she felt safe.</p><p>"You're very strong, Agatha — Nicky is smart. He appreciates what you do for him. A man doesn't define you; I think you're doing a good job."</p><p>Agatha's cheeks were slightly red; she was embarrassed — but she would've rather died than admitting that, Rio's words, actually pierced through her heart. She felt calmer, better.</p><p>"And," Rio continued, "I think I'd make a <em>better</em> husband."</p><p>She couldn't help but feel her heart ache; Agatha tried hiding it with a laugh — but Rio noticed that she had really made her facade fall. It was a joke, nothing to be taken seriously.</p><p>"How do you manage to say such things with a straight face. As if nothing gets through you."</p><p>She may have had a calming expression and demeanour, but, inside of her, there was a raging storm — many feelings, things she wanted to say, and how she desperately wished to touch Agatha, getting closer to her. Agatha had made something change in her — she didn't realise it yet.</p><p>"That's not true — I've been thinking about something as of late."</p><p>Agatha looked away shyly; she knew what she meant and immediately understood.</p><p>"We have to talk about it; <em>we must</em>."</p><p>Rio smiled. "It's okay, tell me when you're ready."</p><p>Nicholas had returned with the bottle of water, handing it to Rio — and Rio thanked him, as he smiled kindly.</p><p>"Mama–, I'm so sleepy."</p><p>Agatha stood up from the bench, her hand went to hold Nicholas's. "Then, let's go home. You ate ice cream, I'm sure you're full."</p><p>Rio had also stood up. She, too, had to get home; Alice would've been furious, and she and her had a talk to do, even if she didn't want to.</p><p>"See you, Nicky! Get some sleep," she smiled at him, then gazed at Agatha, "and goodnight, Agatha."</p><p>"Bye, Rio!" Nicholas replied, as his eyes were about to shut.</p><p>Agatha waved at Rio — and the two began to walk towards home. Rio was left alone, her phone began ringing: it was Alice, meaning she had to run at home.</p><p>—</p><p>"Mama," Nicholas managed to say, sleepiness had not gotten him yet, "Rio is pretty cool."</p><p>Agatha smiled.</p><p>"Yes," she remembered Rio's lips on hers, a dangerous thought to have so sudden, and so off guard. "I <em>guess</em> she is."</p>

<p>Rio returned home — she felt happy, yet incredibly scared; Alice was on the couch, she seemed to be sad and distant, Rio <em>knew</em> that it was her fault.</p><p>So, she walked towards her — as she sat on the couch, right next to her.</p><p>"Alice, we can talk."</p><p>She looked at her, eyes severe yet understanding; she hated discussing with Rio — even more when she lied to her.</p><p>"Rio, I simply wish to know what's going on. You've been acting weird for days — almost a week — and you've been out for the whole day. I," she hoped not to sound too desperate, "I tried to mind my business; but you've also been distracted at work."</p><p>Rio took a deep breath; trying to find the right words, but it wasn't easy — maybe Alice would've appreciated her honesty?</p><p>"Alice—, I found a <em>new</em> job. Today, it was my first day, that's why I was out the entire time."</p><p>Alice blinked twice, as if Rio had told one of her usual jokes — but she didn't appear to be joking — she had this serious face, the most serious Rio had ever been.</p><p>"Where?"</p><p>"Harkness company; Jen's workplace."</p><p>There was a minute of silence — Rio could feel her heart racing, hands sweaty, and a sudden sense of guilt overcome her.</p><p>A loud sigh from Alice.</p><p>"Why did you apply there?"</p><p>Rio couldn't say that she applied to be closer to Agatha; because, originally, she truly did apply for her to have a possibility of being more satisfied with her life — so, she would've told her the second option.</p><p>"I was told that it's a good start for people with no work experience — and I wanted to try," Rio blurted out, "Alice," continued, "I should've told you, but I was afraid of how you'd react. I like being a barista. It's fun making coffees — but I couldn't see me being there <em>forever</em>."</p><p>Alice's hand went on Rio's shoulder, trying to reassure her.</p><p>"Rio, I didn't want you to work for me for eternity," she smiled, and that had made Rio smile too, "I always knew that you were unhappy, but you pretended that everything was fine. I know you have big dreams, and working in a café isn't the right way to fulfil them."</p><p>"You're not angry at me?"</p><p>"Oh—, I'm extremely angry at you," Alice teased, "I mean, you just had to talk about it; you didn't murder anyone, or you're not in any kind of <em>weird</em> relationship with somebody!"</p><p>Rio laughed nervously; '<em>weird relationship</em>', well, it was complicated, even more to think about it — but Alice couldn't know that.</p><p>"How can I get forgiven?"</p><p>"I've been craving an ice cream—"</p><p>"<em>No</em>—!" Rio would've died if she had had another ice cream. She was so tired of it — for her to hate something she loved so much — she was at her last straws. "Uh, anything else?"</p><p>Alice was surprised, scared even. But, she decided to respect her friend's wish.</p><p>"Let's get some drinks? I'll tell Jen and Billy to come!"</p><p>Rio nodded — maybe she could've used one or two drinks to calm herself down.</p><p>—</p><p>"When Rio told me that the boss wanted to talk to her, in her office, I already saw the end of her career before her own eyes!" Jen was talking animatedly; alcohol already flowing in her veins — she had always been weak compared to the others.</p><p>Everyone laughed, except Rio. If only they knew the truth — that she had been called for other (impure) motives — they would've reacted in a very different way. But, she couldn't have told the truth, ever.</p><p>"First day and causing troubles already?" Billy joined the conversation; he was having trouble containing his laughs, "I mean, what has she told you?"</p><p>Alice looked curious, and so was Jen — and Rio began to feel nervous.</p><p>"She told me how good I was at my job — obviously."</p><p>"Bullshit," Alice smiled, "Rio must've messed up so badly that she had to be scolded by the Agatha Harkness herself."</p><p>'Scolded' wasn't exactly the right word — if by 'scolded' Alice meant making out without no remorse; then yes, 'scolded' would've worked.</p><p>"I bet the boss gave her extra work; she does this to newbies." Jen added, as if she had been through the same thing — reviving her trauma through Rio.</p><p>"She's not that bad — you guys are exaggerating things."</p><p>Jen laughed, Alice had a doubtful expression, and Billy didn't say a word; but they all looked at her, concerned.</p><p>"Nice joke, Rio — now, let's have another drink to celebrate your first day!" Jen had raised her hand to catch the attention of a waiter — she was going to be drunk in no time.</p><p>Suddenly — a notification appeared on Rio's and Jen's phones; as they suddenly took them in their hands. There had been made a group–chat, work related — their coworkers had done that.</p><p>"What?" Rio whispered; she barely could stand her coworkers. Some were fine, but the others were complete pain.</p><p>As she read through the texts — she had caught an idea of why that group had been made; they were deciding on a place to where to go for a company's dinner — which meant socialising, which meant talking to other people. Rio sighed, but soon, she noticed that Agatha was in the group–chat too. She gasped — had she organised the whole thing?</p><p>"<em>Company's dinner</em>! That's great — isn't it Rio?" Jen was more enthusiastic than her. Maybe she would've realised what it meant after the alchool had left her body.</p><p>"Oh, so that stuff doesn't happen in movies!" Billy laughed, and so did Alice — who knew how much Rio hated those kinds of stuff.</p><p>"Man, there's the boss too — here I thought I could have fun," Jen sighed, "I think she wants to see how us newbies act. I guess it's a dinner strictly for us."</p><p>Rio gazed at the texts — the dinner would've been paid by the company; the restaurant was of the most prestigious of the city. Was it really Agatha's doing? But why?</p><p>Rio received a text from Agatha; she told her to meet with her briefly at the park, where they met for their 'date'. Why would she want to meet her so late?</p><p>"Guys — I feel tired; I think I'm heading home," Rio stood up, taking her things as she hurried to leave.</p><p>"Want me to go with you?" Alice asked, as she was about to take a sip from the drink.</p><p>"No, no! Please, stay — night's still young! I'll see you later! Bye Billy, Jen."</p><p>Then, she ran towards the exit.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio had never walked that fast; in about five minutes, she had reached the park — only to find Agatha sitting on a bench, she looked sad, stressed and on the verge of crying.</p><p>So, Rio got closer to her — standing up, without not sitting beside her.</p><p>"Agatha," she spoke softly, "we saw each other hours ago — can't stand not seeing me for long?"</p><p>"We have to <em>end</em> this."</p><p>A wave of shock hit Rio; but Agatha seemed calm, calmer than usual, and that infuriated Rio — why was she so calm? As if she didn't matter to her.</p><p>"End what, <em>exactly</em>?"</p><p>"You shouldn't have kissed me."</p><p>Agatha lifted her gaze — her eyes meeting Rio's; they were as cold as ever, sadness in them.</p><p>"But you kissed back?"</p><p>"I regret doing that," her voice was weak, and Rio felt thousands of emotions in her heart — her eyes were teary, hands shaking, as she bit her lip, almost hurting it.</p><p>"You <em>regret</em> it?"</p><p>"Yes, I do," Agatha stood up, facing Rio, "I told you, there are rules that must be followed — you and I work together now, I'm your boss, you're my employee. I want for us to have a working relationship; nothing else, nothing more."</p><p>A tear streamed down Rio's cheek, her nose stuffy and red — she had never cried for someone, and she had never thought she would've done that; but, here she was, crying for Agatha. But, she wanted to respect her wishes — if that meant seeing Agatha happy, she would've done that.</p><p>"Alright— <em>Ms. Harkness</em>," she attempted a smile, that was not so convicing, "I will do as you told me; it was stupid of me to think that I—," Rio stopped, "nevermind."</p><p>Agatha didn't reply — how could she?</p><p>"See you at work," she managed to say, as she walked away from Rio. Her steps were hasty, strong.</p><p>Rio watched her go; her heart sinking into deep despair. How would she have faced her at work? But, more importantly, how could she mask her sadness? She needed a cigarette — desperately so.</p>

<p>She had managed to escape Alice's questions — she <em>knew</em> something was wrong with Rio; she hadn't eaten her usual breakfast or anything for the matter. She tried to get some questions out of Rio, but it seemed useless — she just wouldn't talk.</p><p>They briefly discussed who would've taken her place as a barista; Alice had already found a substitute, she worked fast. That scared Rio.</p><p>The company's dinner was on that day — Rio had to get through the whole, interminable work hours; when she arrived at the company, greeting Jen, she immediately started working on her computer.</p><p>Agatha was in her office; but Rio wouldn't have <em>cared</em> anymore — it was wrong of her to have let feelings develop for Agatha, even more when she had kissed her. In the end, she really was unreachable, out of her league — and she cursed herself for wishing to have something more because nothing would've happened. She had been <em>reckless</em>, but that mistake wouldn't have been repeated again.</p><p>"Rio?" Jen's voice, she sounded worried. "Are you okay?"</p><p>"Yeah," a lie, obviously, as if she could ever tell her the truth; that Agatha Harkness, her boss, had broken her heart and stepped on it, and not even comforted her — remembering that made Rio sigh, "I mean, I guess I didn't get much sleep."</p><p>"Were you excited for the dinner?"</p><p>She couldn't give a <em>damn</em> about that stupid dinner — but for now, she would've used it as an escamotage.</p><p>"Perhaps."</p><p>"Don't worry, Rio—, we'll sit near and socialise, and who knows, making new relationships!"</p><p>Rio laughed at how simple Jen's mind was.</p><p>"Yeah, you're right."</p><p>The hours passed quickly — and, without even realising it, evening had come. Everyone went home to prepare for the dinner — Rio stayed a little while, she was waiting for Agatha, <em>subconsciously</em> doing so, but she didn't come out of her office. She gave up and began packing her stuff.</p><p>—</p><p>Jen and Rio had arrived at the restaurant; they wore suits, just like the ones they used at the office — and they were anxious, even if Jen masked it well. Soon, their other colleagues arrived, and then Agatha.</p><p>Rio looked at her, but Agatha ignored the way she was looking at her; she really moved on so quickly. Perhaps she had never meant anything to her — because she looked completely fine, and Rio noticed how composed she was, while she had her heart in thousands of pieces.</p><p>"If everyone is here," Agatha began speaking, "then, let's take our seats."</p><p>They all entered the restaurant, and they were led to a giant, enormous table — the biggest of the restaurant — which made Rio wonder how?</p><p>Agatha took a seat at the head of the table; it was smart of her to sit there. She would've been able to <em>observe</em> her employees — their every move, hearing every word. A bit paranoid, Rio thought.</p><p>Jen had managed to take a seat for her and Rio. Unfortunately, the seats were near Agatha — Jen couldn't have done that on purpose. Nevertheless, she sat with Jen beside her, and in front of her, there was a strange girl — she could've swore to have never seen her.</p><p>The waiters had arrived; taking the orders, while trying hard to impress Agatha — drinks arrived: wine, beer, and other stuff that, maybe, would've been way too strong.</p><p>Rio had ordered a beer, and she noticed that Agatha was drinking wine, her eyes were absent, and with her mind, she seemed elsewhere — but Rio shouldn't have cared, she was at a dinner for Jen, only for her.</p><p>"Hey, I've never seen you there, are you new?" Rio heard a voice. It was coming from the girl that was in front of her — her gaze lingered on her, surprised that she never noticed her before — her beauty was impeccable, and she had a smile printed on her lips.</p><p>"Never seen you either, I hope you didn't pretend to work here just for a free dinner."</p><p>The girl laughed loudly — everyone turned to look at her, Agatha specifically, but she quickly went back to gazing in the void, but Rio could feel her eyes on her, and on the mysterious girl. After a while, everyone returned to their conversations.</p><p>"Oh, I <em>could've</em> done that instead of working," again, she smiled, "I work here, my name's <em>Hela</em>! You probably didn't see me because I manage the clients, talk to them — convince them to make deals and contracts. I'm good at persuading, that's why they put me there!"</p><p>That explained — Hela was charming and beautiful, and that role just suited her — Rio couldn't have imagined herself to do the same work as her, for once, she was glad to be stuck with paperwork, and computers.</p><p>"You got a big role, and you just started working?"</p><p>"What can I say? I have my ways," Hela took the glass of wine, shaking it a little, "I also think that some clients are so irritating, flirting every here and there. Ugh–"</p><p>Rio understood the feeling; when she worked for the café, she too had to deal with the client's avances and perverted jokes — there was a sort of sympathy for her.</p><p>"I get you — I used to be a barista; these old men just don't know how to stop," she thought of the past — even if she didn't want to, "I'm Rio, by the way, I just started recently."</p><p>"Rio — just what made you consider this job?"</p><p>Oh, the reasons were two — but one of them had broke her heart, and so there was only one left; she remembered telling Agatha that the reason to work there, was to be closer to her, but she couldn't say that.</p><p>She gazed quickly at Agatha, and she had caught her staring — her eyes locked on Rio, then went to Hela. Was she eavesdropping? What was her problem? Either way, she had soon adverted her eyes, but Rio had seen that. Maybe she wanted to make sure that Rio answered correctly at Hela's question — without mentioning her.</p><p>"I don't know — guess I like to punish myself."</p><p>Hela laughed, this time quietly.</p><p>"You're fun, Rio! I could use a friend like you!"</p><p>Rio smiled soflty; Hela was the first, true person (aside from Jen) that didn't find boring — rather intrigued.</p><p>"Please, <em>let's</em> — everyone is so boring here."</p><p>Jen immediately turned to Rio. She had heard that she didn't know how to feel — if annoyed, irritated, or angry.</p><p>"Thanks for calling me boring."</p><p>Hela's attention shifted to Jen; she purred in amusement as she studied her face — Rio felt bad, but she had laughed at her nasty comment.</p><p>"Are you friends with Rio?" Hela asked, with a curious tone of voice — she had never been so engaged in a conversation, especially with colleagues.</p><p>"Unfortunately, yes."</p><p>Rio threw a light punch to Jen, and Hela couldn't help but widen her smile.</p><p>"Well, we should go get drinks after this dinner. The real fun starts after it — and I think everyone's too old for a girl's night."</p><p>"We should tell Alice to come," Rio looked at Jen, as her eyes went to Hela, "Alice is our friend; she works restlessly and needs a break, she's fun — I'm sure you'll like her."</p><p>"I don't mind; the more the merrier!"</p><p>Hela's eyes lingered on Rio. "Besides," her hand went in her hair, twirling them, "I think I'll have someone carrying me home after the drinks. Will you <em>bring</em> me home, Rio?"</p><p>Agatha stood up — the chair creaking on the floor, the poor employee's ears begging for the sound to stop. Rio looked at her, and finally, Agatha had reciprocated the look. Without saying anything, she rushed towards a room — perhaps the restroom — and disappeared from sight.</p><p>"What was that?" Jen asked, worrying about Agatha (for the first time) — she then looked at Hela, then at Rio.</p><p>Rio shouldn't have cared; and <em>wouldn't</em> have cared. She quickly dismissed that thought, reassuring her friends that everything was fine — and that the boss probably felt a little sick. But, deep down, she too worried for her.</p><p>Soon, minutes passed — Rio had been busy chatting with Hela and Jen. In another couple of minutes, the dishes had arrived — they looked good, but something was amiss, Agatha had not returned yet.</p><p>The employees started to worry; almost debating on who would've gone to call her — Rio knew that it would've been her. She stood up, telling everyone she would've been back; Jen and Hela hyped her, not knowing if she would've survived or not.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio entered the restroom — Agatha was looking at herself in the giant mirror, water flowing as a white noise, and she seemed not to have noticed Rio. But, she had to be noticed; her coworkers were starving, and they were counting on Rio.</p><p>"Ms. Harkness," she said, calmy, "the dishes have arrived; we are waiting for you to eat."</p><p>Agatha closed the sink; she took a deep sigh.</p><p>"You're having fun."</p><p>If Rio's doubts of Agatha eavesdropping were unsure, now were <em>certain</em>; she had been listening to Hela's words — to what she had said, to that subtle request. Now, Rio didn't give much of a thought to that, but Agatha obviously did.</p><p>"Well, yeah — the food's great, so are the drinks and so is the company. I'm having so much fun," that was a huge lie, Rio was still thinking of Agatha, her words and cold behaviour of the previous night. "And you?"</p><p>She walked towards her; her steps were heavy, and the heels she was wearing made a distorted noise — she was face–to–face with Rio — and could've pretended that everything was fine, but that simply wasn't true.</p><p>"Don't get too close to her."</p><p>'<em>Her</em>'? What did she mean? Was she talking about Hela? Rio was speechless. She didn't understand.</p><p>"Are you talking about Hela? Why shouldn't I get close to her?"</p><p>Agatha bit her lip. "She's notorious for having flings with her coworkers; she broke many hearts and doesn't seem to care about others," her eyes were serious, more than ever, "I don't want you to get hurt."</p><p>Rio thought of how much of a hypocrite she was — to be worried about her? When she was the one who had hurt Rio the most? No, that was a sick, twisted joke. She couldn't believe her ears.</p><p>"You <em>shouldn't</em> be talking."</p><p>She knew she was right. She had no right to tell her that — but what else <em>could</em> she have done?</p><p>"Rio," Agatha paused for a moment, as her hand went to hold Rio's, gently doing so, "I'm just warning you."</p><p>"And I decide to ignore your warning; I'm a big girl, I can make my own decisions," she stared at her hand, then at her icy eyes, "and I think my heart couldn't be more broken than it already is."</p><p>Agatha let go of Rio's hand — she felt sick to her stomach, hearing those words hurt more than any physical punishments. They stared at each other, without ever looking away.</p><p>"Rio, I'm sorry."</p><p>"Thank you for the apology — it's <em>definitely</em> what I needed!"</p><p>Agatha's hands reached Rio's cheeks, cupping them — and Rio melted at her touch as her hands went over hers, holding them; slim fingers, veiny skin, Agatha had such refined hands. She knew it was wrong, but she couldn't have stopped wanting Agatha's touch.</p><p>"Rio," Agatha whispered, "I really am sorry; you don't get it — I did that to protect you."</p><p>Rio didn't believe her; brown eyes looked at her reddish lips, she shouldn't have, but she couldn't have done that.</p><p>"<em>Liar</em>."</p><p>Their breathing was heavy; Agatha tried and tried — but failed to restrain herself. She brought Rio closer to her, lips gently pressing on hers. Rio kissed back, instinctively — the kiss was calm, gentler than last. Agatha really was a liar because, no matter how much she tried to let Rio go, her mind was always thinking of her.</p><p>She caressed her cheeks — Rio distanced Agatha from her; lips being dirty of lipstick, her eyes still on the blue ones.</p><p>"Why did you do that? Why did you kiss me?"</p><p>Agatha let her go; but she didn't answer.</p><p>"Are you going to <em>regret</em> this too?!" Rio screamed, and she never screamed, not even when furious. "You're also cruel."</p><p>"Don't get near her. Please."</p><p>"You don't tell me what to do! You have no right — my relationships outside work are none of your business."</p><p>There was a brief silence; minutes had passed, and the employees must've been starving.</p><p>"And," continued, "don't ever kiss me again — stop hurting me more than you already did. I won't let you make a <em>fool</em> of myself for the second time."</p><p>She nodded as she walked out of the restroom; Rio was alone — she took deep breaths — and then went out.</p><p>—</p><p>The dinner was confusing; Agatha had had a speech on how she hoped for everyone to enjoy their work, <em>yada yada</em>. A pain to Rio's ears, who still felt Agatha's lips on hers. Why had she done that? Why wasn't she saying anything?</p><p>Once the bill was paid — some headed home, and others elsewhere — Rio, along with Hela and Jen, had decided to go to a bar.</p><p>When there — Alice had been waiting for them to arrive; Hela introduced herself to Alice, and there was this awkwardness that Rio couldn't well explain.</p><p>The four ordered drinks. They laughed, talked, and got to know each other; Rio still felt horrible — she couldn't forget how her lips were soft, how they were shaking.</p><p>She had stood up as she proceeded to go for a smoke — she needed time alone. So, she went out.</p><p>Shortly after, Hela had reached her; Rio was smoking without putting much effort into it, and Hela had sensed that something was wrong.</p><p>"Mind if I join you?" Hela took a cigarette out of her pack and lightened it.</p><p>Rio nodded — and there was a brief silence.</p><p>"So, what's up?"</p><p>"Nothing is up, Hela. I'm smoking, like you."</p><p>Hela looked at her, with a wicked smile on her face — she seemed to know more.</p><p>"Well, something happened. I can sense it. It's useless to deny it; I've been working with people, and, believe me, I can read them pretty well. Judging by your posture, closed and reserved, to your face, that is so sad to look at."</p><p>That was scary — how was she able to get so much info? Working with people had its perks. If denying was futile, she would've told her.</p><p>"Hela, have you <em>ever</em> liked someone?"</p><p>That was so cheeky — but Hela didn't seem to mind.</p><p>"Of course, I'm not a robot. Why? Troubling with love?"</p><p>Rio sighed. "There's this woman; she has charmed me more than any other women had ever done," she breathed the nicotine in, "I shouldn't be saying this — she told me that we had to stop seeing each other, and I agreed to that. But, recently, she kissed me again — and I got angry, because she was the one to tell me to stay away! Why is she acting like this?!"</p><p>Hela pondered on what to say; she knew Rio was trusting her, a lot. She couldn't break that trust — not with someone she had just met.</p><p>"Rio, she is <em>clearly</em> conflicted. She likes you, so much that she craves you — but I think she's scared of loving you, she feels so much for you and doesn't know how to handle it. Maybe, she needs time to understand them. But, I think she just really stubborn."</p><p>Hearing that made Rio feel slightly better.</p><p>"What should I do?"</p><p>"Give her time; or talk to her — one more time — don't go at her with a scary tone, don't get angry, she's new to this, let her know that she's safe with you."</p><p>Rio smiled, for the first time, she had talked about it with someone — Hela wasn't that bad, as Agatha had mentioned.</p><p>"Thank you, Hela."</p><p>"Ah, no worries. I'm sure<em> Ms. Harkness</em> is quite difficult to handle!"</p><p>"Yeah—," wait, <em>wait a minute</em>. Rio's eyes widened, she glared at her — how, why and when had she realised that she was talking about Agatha. She felt scared, and she tried to search for the right words; but everything seem useless. After a while, she spoke again.</p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p>"Oh sorry—, are you talking about Ms. Harkness?"</p><p>"Yes! No— I—, how do you know?"</p><p>Hela laughed, and that laugh seemed hysterical to Rio.</p><p>"It wasn't hard; I'm just <em>really</em> observant. When you came back from the restroom — you had lipstick on your lips, the same kind that Ms. Harkness usually wears, and you were on the verge of tears. You barely touched your food, as Ms. Harkness, and during the dinner you kept making that face — betraying your character."</p><p>"Ok," Rio laughed nervously, "Hela, what the fuck. Please, don't tell anyone."</p><p>"Sorry, you need to learn to hide it better."</p><p>Rio smoked faster than ever; she hated how Hela was able to tell all of that by simply staring at her, was she that readable?</p><p>"If you want — I can help you."</p><p>"Uh? What do you suggest?"</p><p>Hela's arm went around Rio's neck; that was the best part — lifting up her boredom.</p><p>"Leave it to me, Rio!"</p><p>"I have a bad feeling."</p><p>"What? No, no— you'll get the <em>CEO</em>," Hela reassured her, "I'm sure of it."</p>

<p>Hela and Rio had gotten closer; spending all of their time together, not because they were working or doing something work–related, but they were planning a <em>way</em> for Rio to get closer to Agatha.</p><p>Hela knew that Rio was in love with her, and she was sure that Agatha also had some feelings — they studied a plan, hoping that the CEO would've noticed a mere employee.</p><p><em>The first week</em>; Rio had done little steps, but almost nothing happened. The most memorable moment — Hela and Rio were getting a glass of water, and Agatha happened to be near them, scrolling on her phone. Hela glanced at Agatha, then at Rio.</p><p>"God!" Hela yelled, holding tightly the cup of water, "I feel so single as of late, I just need someone's company! Rio, what about you? Want to help me?"</p><p>Rio froze on the spot — she looked at Agatha, but she wasn't looking at her; she had heard Hela's words, she was sure of it. But she seemed to don't care. Hela's plan hadn't worked, Agatha walked away shortly after.</p><p>"Mh, maybe she isn't the <em>jealous</em> type?" Hela said to Rio; the brunette sighed loudly.</p><p><em>The second week</em>; Hela found herself in Agatha's office. She had been called to organise a meeting with one of the most important clients — but Hela thought of a way to make Agatha think of Rio.</p><p>"Got it?"</p><p>Hela had nodded, but suddenly, an idea crossed her mind. "Ms. Harkness, will this meeting be long?"</p><p>"A couple of hours—? Shouldn't be a problem," Agatha's eyes shifted on her, looking perplexed; Hela rarely complained, so something must've been happening.</p><p>"Oh, thank God! I had plans this evening," Hela smiled widely; she thought about what to say next — there were no plans, of course — but she would've pretended so, "I had plans with Vidal; <em>Rio Vidal</em>! We will have a girl's night, lots of fun, alcohol, and who knows?"</p><p>Agatha didn't reply soon; Hela noticed something in her eyes — jealousy? But she was so hard to read, unlike Rio. So, she stood there, waiting.</p><p>"And why are you telling me this?"</p><p>"Perhaps I got excited," Hela laughed nervously, as she went to pick the papers on the table, "I'm taking my leave."</p><p>She went outside; that had gone worse than expected — she saw Rio and walked towards her.</p><p>"Rio, I'm sorry—, I may have angered her."</p><p>"What?!"</p><p><em>The third week</em>; Rio was about to give up. Almost a month had passed, and Agatha truly seemed to not care anymore about her. Maybe she was being childish, and she should've stopped.</p><p>They were in the office, it was lunch break, and everyone had left — everyone, but Rio and Hela.</p><p>"Hela, I give up."</p><p>Hela shook her head, immediately locking eyes with Rio; she couldn't have really said it?</p><p>"What? No, you can't."</p><p>"Hela," Rio sighed, standing up from her seat, her hands turning into fists, "I think it's for the best — we've been doing these acts for almost a month; she clearly doesn't care, never has maybe, and I'm tired of chasing after her."</p><p>Suddenly, Hela had noticed that Agatha was walking towards the elevator — a sudden realisation had come to her; Rio would've thanked her.</p><p>"Alright. Let's stop it — but before you start crying hysterically, I'm feeling thirsty. Can you get me something from the cafeteria?"</p><p>Rio nodded, she needed to walk. So, she walked towards the elevator — suddenly, she had seen Agatha, waiting for the elevator to come; just what Rio needed.</p><p>She stood beside her, waiting. After a while, the doors of the elevator opened, they entered and Rio didn't say a word.</p><p>"Where to?" Agatha asked as she was about to press a button; Rio squinted her eyes, she had really spoken to her — she didn't imagine it. She felt as if that was Hela's doing.</p><p>"Cafeteria."</p><p>"Heading the same place, then."</p><p>She pressed the button, doors closed; reaching the cafeteria would've taken a few instants, but the silence was defeating.</p><p>"I see you got closer to her."</p><p>'Her'? She meant Hela?</p><p>"You ignored my warning," she chuckled, "I expected as much; I can't say anything on it."</p><p>Rio was incredulous. Was Agatha jealous?</p><p>"She's not that bad," Rio thought of Hela; she was funny, caring, and helping in a task that seemed impossible — Rio was so grateful to her, days seemed brighter, "I'm happy I didn't listen to you."</p><p>There again, silence. But — Rio heard a notification coming from her phone; she picked it from her pocket. It was a text from Hela that said:</p><p>'<em>Are you afraid of getting stuck in an elevator</em>?'</p><p>Rio blinked twice, thrice. Was she scared of getting stuck in an elevator? She had never thought about it — it wasn't a pleasant situation, but she didn't really care. But, again, why ask that now?</p><p>'<em>Not really.</em>' — Rio replied, only to add, '<em>I mean, it isn't the best. Why</em>?'</p><p>Soon, a reply.</p><p>'<em>Ok, thanks</em>.'</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>In a matter of few seconds, the elevator had stopped working; the power went out, they both looked at each other — Agatha was surprised, but so was Rio.</p><p>Rio thought that it was Hela's doing; of course, it was her, but why using such extreme methods? And how did she manage to reach the controlls so easily?</p><p>"Seems we're stuck."</p><p>Agatha fell on the floor; the dirty floor of the elevator, her pants would've gotten all the dust on them — she looked panicked, scared, Rio had never seen her like that. Her breathing had gotten fast, and her eyes struggled to stay still.</p><p>If Rio was right, that must've been a <em>panic attack</em>; Rio immediately kneeled down, reaching her, and she looked at her, getting closer.</p><p>"Don't worry; I'm sure help is on the way. Many people use the elevator, I'm sure they are already fixing it."</p><p>Her icy eyes met hers; they were teary, she was panicking so much — but what could Rio do? She knew these things, even experienced it — what she needed now was someone to talk her through.</p><p>Agatha's hand went to hold Rio's; she was shaking, and Rio hated not being able to do much.</p><p>"Rio," even her voice was weak, "I'm sorry to say this. Can you stay with me? Near me."</p><p>Rio nodded as she went to sit beside her; their legs touched, so were their arms and shoulders — she still held her hand, and she wouldn't have let it go. Agatha seemed to have calmed down a little bit; a couple of minutes had passed. When would the elevator be fixed?</p><p>They didn't speak; Agatha was focused on her breathing, the trembling stopped, and Rio was glad that she was doing better.</p><p>After things calmed down, even if not completely, Agatha stared at Rio.</p><p>"Thank you; I must've looked pathetic to you."</p><p>That thought never, ever, crossed Rio's mind. How could she say that? She looked human, more than so — again, she was being so harsh on herself. But why?</p><p>"Don't say that," Rio tightened the grip on her hand, her eyes still on her — she hate it, feeling useless, "I'm serious, I'm so <em>pissed</em> at you; don't make things worse."</p><p>Agatha looked down. She felt ashamed; as she couldn't believe to be scolded by Rio. Either way, the duo had stopped talking, but their hands were still held gently. Agatha should've told her something — but didn't want to, being selfish once more.</p><p>After a while, the older woman gathered enough courage to say something to break the tension.</p><p>"How have you been?"</p><p>Rio wondered why there was such a question. Obviously, she had been unwell; sad, angry, and incredibly messed up, thoughts of Agatha overcoming her every day, every hour. She could've lied, but lying would've been worse. Maybe Agatha had moved on and wouldn't have minded hearing the truth.</p><p>"I've been, well, obviously unwell; I feel like shit— every day is hard, but I'll manage," Rio tried to smile, Agatha had a concern look in her eyes; as if she didn't knew, maybe she cared for Rio. "And you? You seemed to be doing well."</p><p>Agatha sighed, her hand freeing from Rio's.</p><p>"You were right."</p><p>Rio was confused. "About what?"</p><p>"That I'm a liar," her eyes were watery, "I've been lying to myself; I tried to stop thinking about you, I tried to focus on work — but it's useless, I'm tired. I'm tired of lying, tired of pretending I don't care."</p><p>Her voice was weak, almost unbearable to listen. Why was she saying that now? Why not sooner? Rio felt a rush of adrenaline, blood flowing faster in her veins.</p><p>"Agatha, I—"</p><p>"I'm tired," Agatha's hand was on Rio's cheek, caressing it slowly and lovingly, "of pretending that I don't have feelings for you."</p><p>Rio felt cold. Was that a confession? She was happy, but also couldn't help but feel angry towards her — she had made Rio suffer so much; a simple confession wouldn't have saved her. No, Rio needed time to trust her again.</p><p>"Why are you telling me this now? You have no idea of what I went through — because of you — the days I spent crying, hoping for you to say something," Rio's eyes were teary, "I just don't want to get hurt again, you can't do that to me."</p><p>"I should've told you sooner, Rio — believe me when I say that I didn't mean to hurt you; I've been a total <em>idiot</em> to you, and you didn't deserve it, but I was scared," Agatha bit her lip, with intense force, "I was scared if anyone found out; dating me would spread huge rumours — your reputation would be ruined, so mine. I can't let you go through that; trust me, it's not what you deserve."</p><p>"And what made you change your mind? You were scared then, and now?"</p><p>"Now," Agatha caressed her cheek once more and let her go, "I'm <em>still</em> scared — I'm working on it, but I can't keep on ignoring you; I've been having thoughts, desires, that I never had with anyone. It's hard to keep them quiet. They are so loud — as now, my heart is about to explode."</p><p>Rio blushed. She had never thought of hearing something so romantic, so pure, coming out Agatha's lips — she felt her mind heavy, as for her whole body.</p><p>"Agatha," she took a deep breath, "I can't forgive you yet; I'm not sure when I will, but not now. I have to think, for a while — what you did was a lot. And I have to make sure it's safe for me to keep my feelings for you. I need time."</p><p>"That's okay," she reassured, "I don't want to force things; you can even not forgive me, be mad at me for years, I just wanted to let you know how I feel."</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>Suddenly, the elevator started working again; Rio and Agatha immediately stood up. Rio noticed her make–up had dirtied her shirt, she picked the handkerchief that she had in her pockets. Getting closer to Agatha, positioning her hand over the dirty spot.</p><p>"Stay still — you have your make–up on your shirt; but it's not that tragic, just a little bit."</p><p>Rio realised that the spot was on Agatha's chest; so, quickly, without gazing too long on her chest, she cleaned it — she couldn't believe to be doing that — to the woman she had cried over.</p><p>"You're pressing a little hard."</p><p>"Do it yourself, then!"</p><p>Agatha laughed; soon the elevator arrived at destination, the door opened and — everyone looked at them; there were many of Rio's coworkers, Hela being in the first row to enjoy the show she had put on.</p><p>Rio immediately let go of the handkerchief, heading out of the elevator, only for Agatha to do the same.</p><p>"Ms. Harkness! Are you okay?"</p><p>They all chanted in a harmonious, rather disturbing choir. Agatha reassured everyone; and she began to smile a little, which was weird.</p><p>Rio took Hela's wrist, and they went to a secret area of the floor; she slammed her on the wall — Hela looked pleased with herself, but Rio was not.</p><p>"Hela, the <em>fuck</em> did you do?"</p><p>"I helped you—! How did it go? Did you talk it out?"</p><p>Rio was angry. "She had a panic attack; she struggles with these things — you could've hurt her, or worse. Don't ever pull one of these stuff, ever. You heard me?" She got closer to her, "I swear, you don't want to see me angry."</p><p>Hela shrugged. "Alright, alright— I'm sorry. I'm guessing nothing has happened, then?"</p><p>"Something <em>happened</em>; but I'm too angry to tell you — I'm going back to work."</p><p>Rio walked furiously towards the office; this time, she would've taken the stairs. Hela watched her go — not knowing if to feel happy for her, scared or sad.</p><p>—</p><p>The day was about to end; Rio was still working, she still didn't talk to Hela.</p><p>Hela was waiting for her to end her work; she had a coffee in her hand, hoping for Rio to forgive — and a cupcake on the other.</p><p>Agatha was walking towards the exit; she spotted Hela, then Rio — it was early evening. Why were they still there? The cleaning services of the office would've arrived shortly after, they would've eventually left.</p><p>Hela saw Agatha. "Ms. Harkness! Working late as always?"</p><p>"Yes—, today was intense. I had to put some extra focus," she explained briefly, "I suppose you're waiting for Vidal?"</p><p>"Exactly! As sharp es ever!"</p><p>Agatha's eyes lingered on Rio; she had never seen her working so hard. She appeared to be immersed in her work, it made her happy.</p><p>"Well; tell her to stop — for me. She needs to rest, and overworking never ends well."</p><p>Hela smiled. "Ms. Harkness, she won't listen to me! Maybe — you should tell her yourself."</p><p>Agatha pondered for a while; it wasn't a bad idea. So, she walked to her, steps hasty, and quiet — she touched her shoulder, tapping it gently. Rio immediately turned around, expecting Hela to be there, and gasped when she saw Agatha.</p><p>"Rio, go home."</p><p>"I'm almost done; don't worry."</p><p>Agatha went to turn the computer off, she then smiled at Rio; the younger one felt confused, not angry, genuinely confused.</p><p>"Go now, you don't have to work to impress me; you have already done so much."</p><p>Rio stood up, she spotted Hela, waiting for her.</p><p>"Alright," she tried to laugh, "I think it's time for me to go." Rio stared at Agatha — she had a tired look in her eyes. "Goodnight, Agatha. Sleep well; you seem even more tired than me."</p><p>"Oh, that's nothing — rather than tired, I feel very happy."</p><p>Thanks to the low light of the office, Agatha wasn't able to notice the subtle rosy colour on Rio's cheeks.</p><p>"See you."</p><p>She hurried to reach Hela; her friend had a satisfied smirk on her lips. "Rio, you suck at flirting."</p><p>"Shut up; I still won't forgive you."</p><p>They both walked out — Agatha stood in the office; she breathed calmy, looking at Rio.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The following days had been <em>chaotic</em>; it was the busiest week of the year, and everyone struggled with it — some cried, others pretended to be sick, while, a very restricted group of people, managed to do their work, in that group was (surprisingly) Rio, and Jen.</p><p>Rio had not taken a break, not even during lunch — and Jen was actually scared for her, as she had never realised how diligent, responsible she could be. Truth to be told, Rio was doing that on purpose because, if she wasn't working, she would've thought of Agatha — and that couldn't happen, especially during that <em>hellish</em> week.</p><p>It was a deal; working in exchange for no thoughts of Agatha — even if she knew that, eventually, she would've faced them.</p><p>Rio had told Agatha that she needed time to forgive her — <em>which was true</em> — but she also hoped to spend more time together; the CEO was stuck in her office, and they had interacted only for things strictly work–related.</p><p>Hela appeared, smiling even. Rio had yet to forgive her, but she was slowly trying to.</p><p>"What is it, Hela?"</p><p>"It's lunch break; I want to spend lunch time with you!"</p><p>She sighed; it was true that she had skipped lunch many times, but work wouldn't have been done by itself. So, she kindly declined, and Hela called for Jen (who were, surprisingly, friends) to go with her instead, and she accepted, as they both went away.</p><p>Rio felt bad, but she knew that it was the right choice; after a while, she began working on the computer again.</p><p>—</p><p>Evening came; Rio had finished her work, she was exhausted and couldn't feel her hands properly, but, at least, she had finished her tasks, she was quite satisfied.</p><p>Suddenly — she felt her phone vibrating. That meant she had received a text. She picked it up, and it was Alice. Which was strange. Rio read the text and almost passed out.</p><p>Alice had told her that she would've been away the whole night — for some matters she didn't explain, but reassured her that it wasn't serious — and that she had to be alone, for one night.</p><p>Usually, Rio would've been happy, but not this time, because Rio had forgotten something important, and of course, during that fated day; <em>her keys</em>. She rarely forgot her keys, but with the amount of work she had, it might've slipped her mind.</p><p>Rio hurried to tell her that she had forgotten the keys. Alice texted back, telling her to sleep in a hotel for one night, which made Rio sigh deeply; she didn't mind hotels, but she also loved her bed — more than anything.</p><p>She could've asked to Hela to sleep at her house, but she feared knowing in what kind of conditions she lived; if she <em>even</em> had a place.</p><p>Perhaps she could've told Jen, but she couldn't stand her costant nagging, knowing her, she would've made her go to bed at <em>10'00 pm.</em></p><p>There was an option left: Agatha. But that would've been way too shameful, and she was still angry at her (kinda); so, she quickly searched for a hotel — the <em>least</em> pricey one.</p><p>In an instant, a thunder, then the sound of rain; Rio shook her head. It simply couldn't be — but it was what she had imagined. She looked at the window. It was raining a lot and she didn't have an umbrella. Not only she have to sleep in a hotel, but she would also have been soaked wet. Great, what Rio needed to end the day.</p><p>Everyone had left. She was about to turn off the computer, and Agatha had (only then) walked out of the office; she was tired, trying hard not to yawn. She spotted Rio and walked towards her.</p><p>"If you keep working this hard; you might steal my work as the CEO," Agatha smiled, even if she was tired — she tried to make Rio laugh; it was admirable.</p><p>"Well," Rio had hoped for times like this, alone and without any eyes on them, "I <em>might</em>; don't give me ideas."</p><p>Agatha let out a small giggle, making Rio at ease; she missed her laugh, even more than she had originally thought.</p><p>"Come on, enough joking now. Go home."</p><p>Rio laughed nervously. "I wish."</p><p>Agatha gave her a confused look; as if her eyes were telling her, begging her to explain what she meant — Rio quickly wondered if to tell her the truth, or lie, to avoid making her worry.</p><p>"It's nothing! Don't worry."</p><p>"Why can't you go home?"</p><p>The older woman's voice was serious; Rio rarely heard that tone. She would usually use it during drastic times — it meant one thing: she wanted to hear the truth, and lying was out of question.</p><p>"Well, it's raining; I don't have an umbrella," Rio tried to avoid telling her the real deal; that she would've slept in a hotel, and that she didn't like it — but she also didn't want to sound like a spoiled brat.</p><p>"I can lend you a ride at home."</p><p>Rio started panicking; if she was to give her a ride home, she would've noticed that her 'home' was actually a hotel. So, she sighed, lying was useless, she had realised it with her own, wrong, choices of words.</p><p>"That's not that; I–," admitting that was embarrassing, "I left my keys at home, I was in a hurry today. My roommate is away and won't return until tomorrow's morning, so I'm stuck at being in a hotel," she wanted to laugh, but Agatha was staring so hard, "I mean, it's fine; the hotel is fine! I'll manage."</p><p>Agatha knew that it wasn't fine; a bizarre idea appeared in her mind. She would've regretted it? Maybe. But she couldn't leave her — hotels were usually dirty, and, knowing Rio, she would've chosen the cheapest one.</p><p>"There's no need for the hotel—"</p><p>"You're saying I should sleep on the streets?" Rio laughed as she didn't understand where Agatha was leading the conversation.</p><p>"—I'm saying that you can stay at my place."</p><p>There was a long pause; silence surrounding them two. Rio thought that she was messing around, but judging by how serious and by how slightly rosy her cheeks were — she wasn't joking — definitely not. Obviously, she couldn't accept such an invitation, not that she didn't want to, but things would've been way too awkward to handle.</p><p>"Agatha—"</p><p>"No, don't say anything; I wasn't thinking straight, I must be tired. Sorry, I didn't want to make you uncomfortable."</p><p>Rio wasn't uncomfortable, far from it.</p><p>Agatha <em>paused</em> and started to worry as she had not heard an answer from Rio; she feared to have ruined something and hated the thought.</p><p>"Forget it, I was—"</p><p>"Agatha."</p><p>There was a hint of blush on Rio's cheeks; Agatha had noticed it, and she probably should've said something to comfort her, but her offer was made with the purest of the intentions.</p><p>"I'm not uncomfortable," Rio had a shy smile on her lip, "I just don't want to disturb you; knowing what's going on between us, it'd be weird for us to stay one night together. I mean, I'm still angry at you."</p><p>"I get it, really—"</p><p>"But—," she continued, as she couldn't believe her own words, "I really don't like hotels, or such things; so, I guess, I'll accept your offer."</p><p>It was rare for Agatha to see Rio getting shy — she was usually straightforward and without any filters, which was one of the qualities she admired most.</p><p>"Well then, shall we get going?"</p><p>Agatha began to walk towards the exit, an umbrella in her hand, as she waited for Rio to follow her — and she did, she had followed her.</p><p>—</p><p>The rain didn't seem to stop. Agatha and Rio were in the car; Agatha was driving. She didn't appear to be bothered by the rain — perhaps she had many years of experience — and that reassured her.</p><p>Rio couldn't help but imagine Agatha's house; would it be a mansion? An entire building? She was curious, but she couldn't have shown it too much. She stared outside of the window — they entered the rich area, and that didn't surprise Rio much.</p><p>Agatha had stopped the car, parking it slowly and precisely — they arrived at the destination. Rio looked outside; there was a grandiose building, and maybe Agatha owned the whole place.</p><p>"So," Rio said, feeling confident in her own words, "I think you own the whole building, do you?"</p><p>"What? No, I don't," she tried not to let a laugh out of her. "It'd be useless: I'm just living with my son — there'd be no sense for me to buy the whole thing. Also, it is a waste of money."</p><p>A sudden realisation had hit Rio; her son, Nicholas, would've been in the house. She felt nervous — she didn't mind the kid, but being there, for one night, it might've raised some questions in him.</p><p>"Is Nicholas home now?"</p><p>"Of course. Where else should he be?"</p><p>Rio wanted to disappear; the child was smart, but maybe to enough to guess what was going on between her and his mother. She hoped for the best.</p><p>"Doesn't he have school?"</p><p>"Rio, it's <em>evening</em>."</p><p>Agatha was confused, and Rio was simply anxious; but, she tried her best to keep her cool — Nicholas was a nice kid, nothing would've happened.</p><p>"Right! Let's go!"</p><p>So, with a little struggle (due to the rain), while sharing an umbrella — they walked towards the palace.</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha stood before the entrance, searching for the keys of the apartment. Rio waited patiently. After a while, she opened the door; there was Nicholas and his baby–sitter (the girl Rio thought Agatha would've fired).</p><p>"Mama!" Nicholas stood up from the chair he was sitting on, "I knew you would be home soon," he ran over her, hugging her tenderly — Agatha reciprocated the hug, and stared at the girl. He didn't seem to have noticed Rio.</p><p>"Ms. Harkness, good evening; Nicholas has finished all of his homework," she smiled, "I think he did a very good job."</p><p>"Is that so?" Agatha ruffled his hair, and Nicholas smiled. "Thank you for helping him, you can go home; I'll take it from here."</p><p>The girl nodded as she quickly took her things and headed out; now, Rio started to feel calm, less agitated.</p><p>It was by then that Nicholas had noticed Rio; he quickly smiled and walked towards her.</p><p>"Rio! Are you going to live here from now on?"</p><p>Rio couldn't help but blush; how was that kid so straightforward? And why was he saying such things? That wasn't true, at all.</p><p>"No, no— I'm just staying for one night."</p><p>"Did something happen to your house?" Nicholas sounded worried, and Rio definitely didn't want to give him any of her worries; she smiled, trying to reassure him.</p><p>"I was–," how to explain that she had forgotten her keys to a kid? "For today; I can't go home."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>Agatha saw Rio struggling — she decided to step in.</p><p>"Come on, Nicky. Don't worry about her; she'll be staying with us. Everything is okay, it's just for one night," she caressed his cheek, "I will make dinner now, anything you'd like?"</p><p>"Chicken nuggets!"</p><p>"No, Nicholas, you ate it yesterday," Agatha stared at Rio, and she seemed to be upset. What happened? "Rio, why are you making that face?"</p><p>"I also wanted to eat chicken nuggets."</p><p>Agatha let out a sigh; she couldn't believe to have heard that — were they secretly teaming up against her? Nevertheless, she didn't protest; that meal was easy to make, they would've been ready in thirty minutes in the microwave.</p><p>"You should get better tastes in terms of food," her eyes were on Nicholas, "I'll go make them."</p><p>"Wow, Rio! Mama never changes her mind!"</p><p>Rio smiled. "That's because your mama has a <em>soft</em> spot for me."</p><p>There was a moment of awkwardness, followed by a few seconds of silence; she turned around to look at Agatha, and, to her surprise, she had this enigmatic look in her eyes — that could've meant many things.</p><p>"I meant—"</p><p>"I'll prepare dinner."</p><p>And she walked away, heading towards the kitchen; Rio stared at Nicholas. He didn't suspect a thing — she breathed in relief.</p><p>"So, do you want to do something while we wait?"</p><p>"We can watch cartoons!"</p><p>Nicholas took Rio's hand as she led her to the living room. The TV must've been there; and Rio could've used cartoons to think of something else.</p><p>—</p><p>The cartoons were surprisingly good; they had a whole plot, good characters, and animation style. When did cartoons become that well–made? But, there was one thing that bothered Rio — that was not being able to help Agatha.</p><p>So, she stood up from the sofà. Nicholas seemed to be immerse in the show; it was Rio's opportunity to go in the kitchen and see how Agatha was doing.</p><p>She walked the same direction Agatha had taken; the route wasn't hard to forget — though, she felt a little out of place. With a hand, she opened the door of the kitchen; Agatha stood there, preparing the food, looking as focused as ever.</p><p>"Need a hand?" Rio spoke softly; she didn't want to upset her — or distract her from the task.</p><p>Agatha turned around. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>"What else do you think I'm doing? I'm here to help you."</p><p>"I'm almost done; ten minutes, and dinner's ready."</p><p>Rio wasn't satisfied with that — she walked towards her, not too close, the right distance to talk properly. Agatha looked weird, more than so.</p><p>"I feel bad to watch cartoons with your son while you cook for him," she realised how much of a trouble she was being, "and for me."</p><p>"I don't mind cooking for him," Agatha could sense her feelings, she felt shy, "and for <em>you</em>."</p><p>"You don't?"</p><p>"Not at all; I mean, I just have to heat these things, not real cooking, but," her eyes met hers, "one day, I wouldn't mind cooking something nutritious for you."</p><p>How could Rio reply to that? Her heart felt heavy, heavier than the other days; she wanted to know how grateful she felt, how happy — but she couldn't. She was shying away. Agatha was direct, and that had caught her by surprise.</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>"It's nothing, and who knows, maybe you'll change your tastes; they are the ones of a child. You know that, right?"</p><p>Agatha was smiling and seemed to let out a small laugh; she was teasing her, and Rio smiled tenderly.</p><p>"I'll work on it, okay?"</p><p>Soon, Nicholas had entered the room.</p><p>"Mama, do you need help?"</p><p>Rio had never seen such polite, well–mannered kid. What kind of child helps their own mother with trivial stuff? But, it made her smile; they had a really good relationship.</p><p>"You can set the table, Rio will help you."</p><p>Nicholas nodded; Rio followed Nicholas — the kid seemed to know these stuff, and she would've been impeccable.</p><p>—</p><p>The table was set; Agatha had brought the food, Nicholas already sat down, Rio, too, and Agatha joined them shortly after. The chicken looked delicious. They would've tasted even better.</p><p>"Thank you for the food, Mama!"</p><p>Nicholas rushed to pick one and eat it; he beamed up and went to take another one, another, and another. He must've been hungry.</p><p>"Thank you, Agatha."</p><p>Rio had never been so sincere.</p><p>"It's nothing; you better hurry, or Nicholas will eat them all."</p><p>She didn't have to repeat it twice — a bite, then another, and Rio could've swore to be in heaven; it was good, very much. A few minutes had passed, Nicholas was full, and he looked at her mother.</p><p>"Mama, where will Rio sleep? She can sleep in my room!"</p><p>Of course, how could Rio forget? She had to decide a place where to sleep; Agatha and her had not talked about it at all. Sleeping in the same room as Nicholas seemed a fine option; she stared at Agatha, waiting for her reply.</p><p>She didn't reply soon; Rio thought that she was pondering on it, so she replied instead of her.</p><p>"I'll protect you from monster under your bed!"</p><p>"Rio! There are no monsters in my room, I <em>checked</em> already!"</p><p>Rio laughed. "Really? I don't know, I'm still scared."</p><p>"When I'm scared, I usually sleep in Mama's room. Maybe she'll let you sleep in her bed? It always calms me down," Nicholas had said it with such an innocent face; but, on Rio's cheeks, there could be seen a deep red colour. Why was Agatha not saying anything? Either way, she had to reply.</p><p>"No, no way! I can't sleep in the same bed as your mom, because–," Rio didn't know what she was saying, she was panicking. "I bet she snores in her sleep! How could I possibly sleep with her?!"</p><p>Agatha coughed, and Rio started to already see the pearly gates of heaven. "There's no need to argue over <em>these matters</em>; Rio will sleep on the couch."</p><p>Rio was speechless.</p><p>"But, Mama–"</p><p>"It's fine, Nicky. The couch has never looked that good to me," she felt angry, even if she couldn't be angry at her for that, "I'll be fine."</p><p>The silence felt heavy — she rushed to eat dinner.</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha lent Rio some clothes for the night; a plus–sized shirt and shorts, she couldn't complain, and maybe shouldn't. She sat on the couch, where she would've spent the night. Agatha was in Nicholas's room, probably waiting for him to fall asleep.</p><p>Rio admired how caring she was.</p><p>After half an hour — Agatha had returned to her; she looked at her and tried to smile, but seemed terribly tired.</p><p>"He fell asleep."</p><p>Why was she telling her this?</p><p>"Well, he must've been tired."</p><p>Agatha nodded. "He was," the look in her eyes was strange, "Rio, let's go."</p><p>"Go where?"</p><p>"I can't seriously let you sleep here; the couch is hard, and it's not suited for sleeping."</p><p>The air felt short. Rio's eyes widened, and her mouth was dry — was Agatha telling her to sleep in her bed? But why? She had made it clear that it wouldn't have happened. Not that Rio minded — she just wasn't sure of herself.</p><p>"You want me to sleep in your bed?"</p><p>"I mean–," Agatha crossed her arms, and her face was serious, "I can't let you sleep here; tomorrow's going to be worse than today — and I need you in your best form. Sleep is essential for what we do, and we must cherish it."</p><p>Somehow, the whole thing had turned into a lesson — and Rio struggled to see through her — she was as unreadable as always.</p><p>"Just," a tender rosy was on her cheeks, "<em>just sleep</em>?"</p><p>Agatha didn't understand — she truly meant what she had said; sleep and nothing else because that's what she had in mind. Perhaps Rio was thinking of something else, something much different from hers.</p><p>"Yes–, just sleep. Don't worry."</p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p>A small and a very selfish part of Rio wished for Agatha to want more — but it was true that Rio was still angry at her, and it was also true that she shouldn't be hoping for something to happen, that might've been too desperate.</p><p>"What kind of woman do <em>you</em> view me as?"</p><p>Rio laughed. She liked seeing Agatha getting so worked up. It never failed to amuse her; she was so easy to tease.</p><p>So, she stood up from the couch.</p><p>"Then let's go, Agatha."</p><p>Agatha led the way — and Rio felt happier than usual.</p>

<p>Agatha was changing clothes in another room; she had told Rio to relax, to prepare herself for sleep, but she obviously didn't do that — Rio's mind was restless, her room full of her scent. How could <em>one</em> not think?</p><p>So, she wandered around the room — she noticed photos, some were framed, others simply there. Rio looked at them; there was Agatha's graduation day, and she couldn't help but notice that a much, much younger Lilia stood next to her, and Rio gasped. </p><p>Another one portrayed Nicholas during his first years of life; he had weird pyjamas on him, and Agatha looked younger. She couldn't help but notice her beauty — Agatha was still as beautiful as she was before, and that made Rio smile tenderly.</p><p>Soon, Agatha entered the room; Rio turned around immediately, hoping she wouldn't have asked about what she was doing.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>Rio laughed anxiously. Then, she noticed her clothes — she was wearing something so out of character; a white camisole and long, comfy pants. She looked different, more relaxed. Obviously, Rio couldn't stare too long at the camisole. It would've been disrespectful.</p><p>"Looking around, I was curious."</p><p>Agatha walked towards her, noticing the photos. "I see."</p><p>She noticed a saddening gaze in her eyes, and Rio feared to upset her. Who would've liked someone looking through your own personal stuff?</p><p>"I was much younger there," she pointed at her graduation photo, "and there," now, she was poiting towards the photo of Nicholas and her. "I was a bit different, I've changed. Me, my body — <em>everything</em>."</p><p>Rio could sense how deep her sadness had gotten; she looked at her in the eyes, trying to figure out what she was thinking.</p><p>"You look as beautiful as of when you were younger," she smiled soflty, talked quietly, "I hate seeing you sulking about your age; if you keep doing that, I'll make sure you will be the one sleeping on the couch."</p><p>Something rekindled in Agatha's eyes; Rio's words had managed to calm her down, once again, her maturity was admirable, and to be studied. A laugh escaped from her.</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>Rio reciprocated the smile. She was glad to have brought a sense of peacefulness to Agatha — and she watched her walking to the bed, getting into the sheets; Rio had to do the same, and that made her anxious.</p><p>Agatha made herself comfortable in the bed; she grabbed a book that was on that was on the shelf, Rio just stood there — debating on whether getting in or wasting some more time, trying to calm herself down.</p><p>"It's getting late; you should get in and sleep," Agatha's eyes went on her, "I'll read a bit, but you don't have to worry — I'll be quiet."</p><p>It was inevitable; Rio walked towards the bed, she had gotten in — the sheets were soft, warm, and smelled good. She tried her best not to touch Agatha, who was deeply focused on her reading. Once laid down, head on the pillow, she stared at the ceiling — and now what?</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, relaxed her mucles, but nothing. She couldn't just sleep as if everything was fine; Agatha was so close to her, and she preferred a book over her? Indeed, Rio had been the one to not want anything else but sleep — she was having second thoughts.</p><p>She turned around to stare at Agatha, and, to her surprise, she was wearing glasses; Rio found it extremely adorable. Did Agatha usually wear lenses? Oh, her heart ached.</p><p>Agatha noticed Rio. "You should be sleeping."</p><p>A small laugh from Rio. She was able to spot her, even while reading? Was there something this woman couldn't do? As if she was a trained spy or else.</p><p>"Nothing escapes your eyes?"</p><p>"You're not '<em>nothing</em>' to me. That's why."</p><p>Rio was without words; she thanked the thin light of the room because, without it, Agatha would've been able to see how red her cheeks had gotten. How was she able to say something so smooth? While having such a calming tone of voice.</p><p>"I can't sleep," confessed Rio; she felt ashamed, but also glad to have done that.</p><p>"Do you want to take something to help you sleep? I may have some melatonin left, I'll go looking for it."</p><p>"No, Agatha," Rio had to refrain herself from saying some dangerous things, but she didn't want her to go, "I just need to focus."</p><p>"Want me to read you a story?" Agatha teased; she was smiling, widely, and Rio felt even more embarrassed — how could she?</p><p>"That'll be <em>even</em> more distracting."</p><p>After a few seconds, Rio realised what she had said. Agatha was silent, and Rio wanted to say something, anything, but couldn't think of the right words.</p><p>"Do I distract you from sleeping?"</p><p>Agatha was being sly. Rio had enough; she was tired of walking on egg–shells, tired of watching her every move, tired of denying how she wished Agatha.</p><p>"Of course," Rio had gotten closer to her, "I <em>fucking</em> like you; how can I <em>possibly</em> be calm? Not when we're sharing a bed."</p><p>"But, you're angry at me."</p><p>It was true; Rio was angry, but she couldn't have brought herself to be mad at her forever — not when Agatha had offered her a place, made her food, and more.</p><p>"Yeah, but I can't keep on being angry at you."</p><p>Agatha left the book on the shelf, removed her glasses; she sat on the bed, and Rio did the same — they stared at each other — for what seemed to be hours.</p><p>"Rio," her hand caressed her cheek, "I was so horrible to you; I understand if you don't want to forgive me. Take your time."</p><p>"Sometimes you're so stupid," Rio got closer to her, "I have to spell it out for you? Agatha, I'm not even that angry anymore," her lips almost touching hers. "It's getting hard to not kiss you — I've been holding myself back, but—"</p><p>Agatha's hands were on Rio's cheeks; she pulled her closer, their lips fusing in a kiss — it was gentle, steady, and desperately wanted from them both; Agatha pushed Rio on the bed, positioning herself atop of her. The kiss continued until one of them was out of air — Rio looked at her, and Agatha had realised the position they were, a dangerous one.</p><p>"Sorry, I got carried away—"</p><p>Agatha was about to move away, but Rio stopped her; hands on her waist, pulling her down, waiting for the right words, blocking her from getting away.</p><p>"Who said you could leave?" Rio had never imagined for things to escalate this quickly — for Agatha to be on her, as she stared intensely.</p><p>Soon, she leaned to kiss Rio again; biting her lower lip, as she seemed to enjoy it. Rio moaned, shamelessly and loudly, while Agatha's hand caressed her whole body. Then, her lips went on Rio's neck — licking, kissing it, and biting it slowly — was she going to give her hickeys? Perhaps Agatha was as lost in her own desires as Rio was.</p><p>Agatha's hand stopped; her fingers lingered on her shorts — Rio knew what she wanted to do, to step up things. Suddenly, she lifted up, her eyes meeting the brown ones, Agatha noticed how red her cheeks were, how out of breath she truly was. It was a view she adored.</p><p>Rio tried to be cool — but her body was telling otherwise; she craved that moment, Agatha's touch, attentions. They were still, then, a laugh from the older woman.</p><p>"Is it okay if I—"</p><p>"Agatha, you can do everything you want; <em>everything</em>."</p><p>"So needy," Agatha smiled, and Rio wanted to disappear; she was right, not even arguable. "Let me give you a proper apology."</p><p>Agatha's hand entered her shorts, then flew inside her panties; she was already wet — by something simple as kissing. Truth to be told, Agatha couldn't really say that she wasn't aroused either as she, too, could feel herself wet, but Rio wouldn't have known that.</p><p>"My, I'm flattered to see <em>such</em> reaction," Agatha got closer to her lips, her fingers ready to enter inside; she loved to tease Rio.</p><p>"I wonder how wet you are."</p><p>As expected, Rio's reply had pierced Agatha's heart; she smiled, not denying that very real fact — Rio was right, but she wouldn't have admitted it.</p><p>Agatha's lips were, once again, on Rio's; she kissed her, stealing precious air — as her fingers entered — one, two, slid inside perfectly, and Rio gasped once she felt them.</p><p>The kiss continued; Agatha's movements were fast, then slow, then fast again. She was teasing her — Rio couldn't help but moan — and that made Agatha deepen the kiss, lips almost swollen.</p><p>"Agatha—," she managed to say, with not that much force; her senses numb, her between so hot.</p><p>The fingers curled inside; Rio's breathing was heavy, loud, and amusing to Agatha's ears. In and out, while Rio tried to calm herself — she was making so much noise, would Agatha have found her embarrassing? Judging from the look in her eyes, she was enjoying it.</p><p>"Rio, are you close?"</p><p>Rio looked at her; she was, she couldn't take it anymore — the pure ecstasy of the moment was at its peak, and Rio, sooner than expected, would've come by the hands of Agatha.</p><p>"Isn't that obvious?"</p><p>Agatha grinned; her fingers went deeper, and Rio could've swore that she was in heaven. Their lips met again — panting, Rio tried to kiss her back, but she felt too much pleasure.</p><p>"You're beautiful, Rio."</p><p>Rio attempted a laugh. "You're getting better at compliments."</p><p>"I'm so sorry, about everything."</p><p>"Shut up," Rio panted, "I can't believe you're apologising when I'm about to—"</p><p>The fingers had reached the spot; Rio was close, closer than ever — Agatha felt warmness, the walls of Rio's insides were tightening, and the liquid was coming out at an alarming speed.</p><p>"I won't ever hurt you anymore; Rio, you're so smart, caring, beautiful. I can't think of anything better, anyone better than you."</p><p>"Agatha," her body was twitching, she couldn't believe how attractive her words were — how lovingly, and soft, "I, seriously, need you to tone down the compliments."</p><p>"You liked them a few moments ago."</p><p>Rio felt that the end was near; Agatha's fingers were long, slim, and that could easily excite even with the smallest movement.</p><p>"Don't tell me," Agatha got closer to her ear, whispered while still continuing to pleasure her, "Rio, you like when I talk you <em>through</em> it?"</p><p>Rio couldn't deny it, because Agatha knew the reactions of her body. "What of it?"</p><p>"So cute," Agatha laughed, "Rio, you always act like this; unserious, determined and annoying feisty. But, that's not bad. I like it."</p><p>"We're back to point one — how can you get good, then bad, then good again?"</p><p>Agatha wanted to see how far she could get Rio; her fingers went further, making the body of the younger one shift — she knew she was close, but wanted to help her.</p><p>"Rio," she was now facing her, eyes on hers — noticing how the flush of her cheeks had gotten out of hand, her expressions pure gold. "You're doing so good, so, so good. So obedient, so pretty, so—"</p><p>She was grasping for air; Agatha's words were like a spell, and she was completely bewitched by them — as if she was a witch.</p><p>"Agatha, <em>please</em>—"</p><p>"Yes, go on; come for me, sweetheart."</p><p>Rio didn't have to hear it twice. Soon, she had come. A long, loud orgasm echoed in the room — she had never felt so much pleasure, Agatha removed her fingers and went on her lips, licking the juice of Rio from her fingers; she smiled, licking her fingers, one by one. Rio's cheeks were on fire. How was that one able to excite her that much?</p><p>"You were amazing, Rio."</p><p>Her wet lips met hers; sharing a kiss — ecstasy of the moment wearing off, and Rio's mucles could relax.</p><p>"I didn't do anything," Rio felt a sudden awkwardness, "I think you did most of the job."</p><p>"That's not true. If it wasn't for how wet you were, the fingers wouldn't have slid in so easily."</p><p>She couldn't believe what she was hearing; Agatha had reminded Rio how desperate she had been — how she had waited for that moment. It was embarrassing, but Agatha didn't seem to think of it as something bad.</p><p>"Would you mind watching how you phrase things?"</p><p>Agatha laughed; she laid down, next to Rio — she felt happy, but she knew that what they had done meant that things would've taken a huge turn.</p><p>"What now, Agatha?"</p><p>"Do you want a round two?"</p><p>Rio giggled at how Agatha was able to lighten up the mood; she didn't mind that — but she was talking about other stuff.</p><p>"What does it mean for us? We can't — I mean, you're the CEO."</p><p>"I know," she bit her lower lip, "I've kept it hidden; but, I'm soon talking to my mother — about dating politics between employees. Usually, it's prohibited to date, and what makes things worse is that I'm your boss."</p><p>"Time for a promotion, then?"</p><p>Agatha laughed tenderly. "My mother will throw a fit. That's why I need to talk to her properly — she is very strict with these things. I don't have to tell her that I'm the one who wants to change things for my own situation — I have to be subtle and cautious with my words. Also, if her answer is positive — and we were to be affectionate in public — there'd be rumours; you dating the CEO, who also happens to be a woman."</p><p>"I'd kick their asses, I don't mind," Rio sounded serious, but Agatha wouldn't probably like to avoid any fights or matters of that sorts.</p><p>"That's not the solution; I have to think it properly — I'm still figuring it out."</p><p>Rio was sad. "I'm sorry for saying this — don't feel offended — but, are you happy with being the CEO? It looks like a lot to handle. Having to hide everything seems tiring."</p><p>Agatha pondered on the answer; did she like it? Not really — it was something that her mother had imposed on her, she really didn't have a choice. Since she was little, she was destined to do that — and Agatha couldn't escape her fate.</p><p>"No, I don't like it," Agatha's voice was doubtful, "I've always wanted to open a little café — but that wasn't what my mother had in mind for me. I graduated in economics because of her; but I never liked it. Just went with the flow."</p><p>Rio could sense how hurt she was.</p><p>"Agatha, I may sound childish but, please—, it's not too late to follow your dreams; I'll be there for you — whatever you decide — you've been alone for so long, but now I'm here, and it's hard to get rid of me."</p><p>Agatha kissed Rio's cheek; hugging her arm and snuggling closer to her — she felt safe, understood, and not alone.</p><p>"Rio, how can you be so good to me?"</p><p>"It's the least I could do," she looked at her, "I mean—, if you're into women who are mean; I'll try to be mean?"</p><p>A soft laugh from Agatha, and a smile appeared on Rio's lips. It was a pleasant feeling, and she wished for it to last forever.</p><p>"Rio," Agatha tightened the grip she had on her arm; she appeared shy, yet determined, "I don't want to put some pressure on you, but," her eyes were docile, timid, "would you like to <em>start</em> dating me?"</p><p>She could feel her heart beat faster, eyes widening — she got closer to her. "I thought I'd be the one asking."</p><p>They both laughed; knowing that now, things were about to change — now, they had each other. After minutes of laughter, their eyes met, Agatha's were watery, and Rio's shined.</p><p>"Say, Agatha," Rio pressed a kiss on her cheek, "I wouldn't mind a round two."</p><p>Agatha sighed as she turned around; her back facing Rio. "We should sleep now."</p><p>Rio pouted, but she was right. She got closer to her, arms wrapping around her waist, pulling her in — she tried not to play with her hair, she simply kissed her head.</p><p>"Goodnight, Agatha."</p><p>Agatha hummed in response.</p><p>Finally, Rio could fall asleep; she felt tired, exhausted — but happy — knowing that Agatha was <em>hers</em>.</p>

<p>Rio had woken up before Agatha; she stretched her arms and yawned. The sunlight entered through the window, enlightening the visage of Agatha, so Rio stared at her — not knowing if to wake her up or let her sleep a little more.</p><p>It was around 7'00 am and, perhaps, she should've.</p><p>How to wake her up? Rio got closer to her; she poked her cheek, trying not to laugh, then she decided to squeeze her arm, but nothing happened. Maybe words would've worked? She leaned in, her lips near her ear.</p><p>"Agatha," she thought for a while of the key–words to say, which words would've awaken her? "Work, paperwork, meetings!"</p><p>Agatha groaned — she seemed awake, but not completely. So, Rio thought of something more strong; a smile appeared on her.</p><p>"<em>I'm seeing another woman</em>."</p><p>It was then that Agatha had opened her eyes; she quickly sat on the bed, staring (while half–asleep) at Rio; she didn't understand what was going on.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>Rio laughed. "You have to work on your jealousy."</p><p>Suddenly — Nicholas had entered the room; lucky for Rio and Agatha, they weren't doing anything, just talking. He got closer to the bed and looked at his mother.</p><p>"Mama, could you make breakfast? I have school."</p><p>Agatha immediately stood up. "Sure, honey. I'm sorry, I must've been tired."</p><p>Nicholas stared at Rio. "How did you sleep? Did Mama protect you from monsters?"</p><p>Oh, if only he knew. But, she didn't want to traumatise a child; a smirk on her lips — she stared at Agatha, who was glaring at her — whatever her answer would've been, it better not contain anything weird.</p><p>"I did; your mom is good at protecting me."</p><p>Nicholas smiled — he didn't suspect a thing.</p><p>"That's because you're," Agatha blocked herself, placing a hand on her lips. She stared at her son, then at Rio, whose eyes were playful. "You're an esteemed guest."</p><p>'<em>Esteemed guest</em>'? Rio wanted to laugh — but she respected Agatha's choice of words; so, she simply gave her a soft, timid smile.</p><p>Nicholas was pulling Agatha's hand, and that meant that he was hungry; he always knew how to make himself seen.</p><p>"Come on; I'll make you both breakfast," Agatha said, Nicholas beaming up.</p><p>"Are you sure? I may have—"</p><p>"Rio, you're my esteemed guest."</p><p>She smiled; Rio felt her cheeks burning — Agatha walked out, with Nicholas holding her hand. Rio should've followed them, but she was slowly realising what had happened. And that Agatha was her girlfriend.</p><p>—</p><p>They had a delicious breakfast; Agatha was an exceptional cook, and Rio couldn't complain. The three of them were in the car — Agatha had to bring Nicholas at school, and Rio didn't mind going with them (also because Agatha had offered her a ride to work). Once they arrived at school; Agatha had told Rio to wait for a few minutes — Rio nodded, waved at Nicholas (wishing him a good day), and then, they left.</p><p>Rio was alone with her thoughts; for the first time, she had some thinking to do. Agatha Harkness was her girlfriend, but also her boss — not that she minded it, but things would've gotten way more complicated now. Eventually, she'll have to introduce her to Alice, Jen, Hela, and heck, even Billy. Not to mention her parents — but that could've waited — she was moving way too fast.</p><p>Either way, she felt incredibly happy; with Agatha, she felt invincible and hoped for her to feel the same. Whatever was about to come, she would've faced it — with her girlfriend by her side, not leaving her alone.</p><p>Soon, Agatha had returned; getting in the car, and staring at Rio. "I was thinking," her lips curled in a smile, "I think we should kill some time since the company opens in about an hour. Would you like to get a coffee?"</p><p>Rio smiled. "Sure," she thought of going to Alice's café, but, truth to be told, she didn't know what her friend was doing, where she was heading or if she café was open. "Let's go to my – ex – workplace."</p><p>The car started — heading to that familiar place.</p><p>—</p><p>Surprisingly enough, the café was open; Alice was inside (Rio had seen her) — and suddenly, she had realised that she was with Agatha. What would've Alice think? Probably nothing since they were there for coffee; not small talks. Rio was starting to get paranoid.</p><p>Agatha had entered — followed by Rio.</p><p>Alice's eyes met the ones of Rio's. She smiled, then she met the icy ones, and she felt intimidated but couldn't really show it. To be safe, she put on a calm and composed mask; greeting them both.</p><p>"Alice," Rio ran to her, "I thought you wouldn't open today; where have you been?"</p><p>"Something family–related, I needed to be out of town for a while. But, I'm back," Alice stared at Agatha's, who had not spoken a word, "I'll tell you more later — I'm guessing you want a coffee? You, both?"</p><p>Rio gazed at Agatha; she stood there, perhaps feeling nervous.</p><p>"We'll get two black coffees."</p><p>Alice nodded as she went to prepare the orders; there was something she wanted to ask — but was hesitant. After the drinks were made, she handed them to Rio, and Agatha was about to pay.</p><p>"Rio, I was wondering," Alice had to know, "I was thinking — you didn't have trouble sleeping in a hotel? I'm sorry, I didn't think you'd forget your keys."</p><p>That question, that has been posed with no ill intentions, had actually managed to make Rio laugh nervously; as she looked at Agatha, then at Alice — what now?</p><p>"I—, no, no trouble at all!"</p><p>"She slept at my place," Agatha's voice; it sounded so severe yet soft — and Alice blinked twice as hard, she had heard it? She didn't imagine it? Rio was also surprised, as she tried to mask it, failing miserably.</p><p>"Oh," Alice was able to say that, she stared at Rio mischievously. "<em>Oh</em>?"</p><p>Agatha wasn't panicking — or anything. She was composed, as if nothing too scandalous had been said. Rio took the drinks, handed one to Agatha, and they hurried to leave the café.</p><p>Rio breathed in and out; Alice definitely knew. She stared at Agatha, who was smirking, looking at her in a weird way.</p><p>"Is something wrong, Rio?"</p><p>"She definitely thinks there's something going on between us."</p><p>Agatha took a sip. "Did you want to keep it low?"</p><p>Rio was shocked. "No? I thought <em>you</em> were the one who wanted to keep it low; reputation and stuff."</p><p>Agatha smiled; Rio was right to be concerned, even weirded out — Agatha really didn't mind it — she thought that, by slowing letting people know about them, starting from her friends, would've been better. The company was a whole other level, but her friends deserved to know. And she didn't want to keep Rio hidden more than she would've already done.</p><p>"Not really. Also, I didn't say anything too scandalous. Just <em>gal pals</em> sleeping in the same room, bed—"</p><p>A quiet laugh from Rio; she found her adorable.</p><p>"Let's head to work now."</p><p>Agatha said while walking towards the car, she felt lighter — and mind at ease, as Rio's.</p><p>—</p><p>They were in the elevator; the drinks had given them the right energies. They would've worked even better — Rio stared at Agatha, she knew that, now, in the company, she had to not be too obvious on her feelings for her.</p><p>"Work hard today, Rio," she looked at her, "I mean, you always do; but don't let me disturb your trains of thoughts."</p><p>"It's going to be hard," Rio replied — in a few minutes, they would've arrived at the office. It was a golden opportunity. "I need a little motivation."</p><p>Agatha smiled; she leaned in, her lips touching Rio's — they melted, the kiss was soft, gentle, and lasted not as long as Rio wanted to. Soon, they separated; the older one cleaned the lipstick off the younger lips.</p><p>"Better?"</p><p>Rio smiled. "I don't know; I might need another one."</p><p>Agatha adored to see how needy she was; but, another kiss would've meant increasing the chances of getting caught — as much as she wanted to, that could've happened.</p><p>"If you work hard, I might consider it."</p><p>A few seconds — the elevator was about to open, Agatha slid her hand on Rio's ass, squeezing it tightly, and Rio flinched at such bold movement.</p><p>"Don't disappoint me, <em>Vidal</em>," she whispered. The door opened, she removed her hand quickly, and walked away — as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Rio stood there; she felt warm, and so, so incredibly aroused. How can Agatha tease her so perfectly? Her cheeks were burning, her breath short; she stepped outside. Agatha had already entered the office, she didn't wait for her.</p><p>Once inside, there was chaos. Something had happened — Agatha looked worried. What was going on?</p><p>"Ms. Harkness," Jen's voice, full of doubts, "I'm glad you're here—, your mother is in the office, she's been waiting for you."</p><p>'<em>Her mother</em>', Rio felt scared; she looked at Agatha, but she didn't look back. She nodded at Jen, thanking her for letting her know and, quickly, walked towards the office.</p><p>Rio felt her heart heavy; she hoped for things to go well.</p>

<p>Rio should've focused on her work; her eyes kept shifting from the computer to the room — she may have typed some things wrong, or everything wrong, Rio couldn't seem to concentrate. It was after an hour of doing the exact same movement that Jen had had enough.</p><p>"Rio–, can you <em>please</em> stop moving? I'm trying to concentrate; you're not helping."</p><p>"I'm sorry–, I'm nervous, okay?"</p><p>Jen tilted her head. "About what?"</p><p>She couldn't explain it — nor tried to; the time wasn't right, so she looked at Jen, her eyes worried, and her friend almost thought of giving her something to calm her down.</p><p>"Does her mother often visit?"</p><p>"Yeah?" Jen tried to recall the other times, "I mean–, they just talk a lot until one of them storms out of the office; and then she comes back later. I think they're just talking, per usual."</p><p>She knew that it wasn't a normal talk; Agatha had told Rio about wanting to change the dating politics, making a difference, and creating a safe environment. Rio had also remembered how her homophobic mother would've never let her date another woman, which made her worry even more.</p><p>"Hey girls," Hela's voice, which was weird, because she usually worked in the conference room; her being there made no sense. Perhaps she was on a break. "What are we doing?"</p><p>"I'm trying to calm Rio down."</p><p>Hela's gaze went from Jen to Rio. She had noticed her friend's worried state but didn't know what the cause of it was.</p><p>"Jen– maybe you can go take a bottle of water for her?"</p><p>Jen stood up from the chair. She nodded and walked towards the nearby vending machine. It was then that Hela had taken Jen's spot — she stared at Rio. "What's up?"</p><p>Rio sighed. "Agatha's mother is in her office."</p><p>Hela blinked twice, thrice. She didn't understand where this conversation was going — either way, she had to find out.</p><p>"And? She often visits; they scream, fight, and run away until one of them returns."</p><p>How was this allowed? It irritated Rio to see how calm Hela was, but also Jen was. She didn't understand — she only knew she had to do something. But what?</p><p>"This is different, Hela," Rio's eyes met hers, they were black and painfully charming, "I'm <em>dating</em> Agatha; and I'm sure she's telling her mother to change the dating politics of the company."</p><p>Hela gasped, and then she proceeded to smile — even if smiling may have made things worse; she wanted to show how proud she was of her.</p><p>"Fuck, are you serious? When, how–?"</p><p>"It doesn't matter now," she looked over the room; she could hear sounds of voices, screams that tried to keep it down. "I'm worried, very worried."</p><p>"I don't want to break you <em>idyllic</em> dream; I'm very happy for you, but," Hela's voice was serious — never in her life she had imagined to hear that, "I don't think anything is going to change. You have to be realistic."</p><p>Rio's head turned around, staring at Hela.</p><p>"Why do you say that?"</p><p>"Do you think that she'll accept your relationship? Rio, be realistic," her voice was doubtful, scared of hurting her friend, "I don't think her mother is accepting; a gay woman, with a younger girlfriend, that wants to change dating politics so that they can live with less worries? Even if she were to lie, saying that she wants to change them for the sake of others — it's still suspicious."</p><p>She didn't want to accept what she was saying. Deep down, Rio knew that she was wrong; that things would've changed — things would've been fine — even if not, Rio wouldn't have left Agatha's side.</p><p>As Rio was about to answer, Agatha stormed out of the room; there were tears in her eyes, her face red and heavy steps that echoed through the room. And that scared Rio, she looked towards Hela — she seemed as surprised as she was.</p><p>"I'll be back, Hela." Rio got up from her seat; following where Agatha was going, she didn't seem to want to walk for a long time.</p><p>Hela watched her go — hoping she hadn't been too harsh on her.</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha had managed to leave Rio behind; the hallways had never looked that confusing, and Rio struggled to find her — she stopped, thinking of where she might've been. After a while, she remembered the storage room; she ran towards the room, recalling when they both had their first kiss, but this time, it was <em>way</em> different.</p><p>She arrived in front of the door; she noticed that it was slightly open — she entered, turned on the lights, and there she was, Agatha. She sat on the floor, her arms around her legs, hugging them to her chest; her head was on her knees, Rio could hear her crying, her stuffy nose.</p><p>Rio had closed the door behind her, walked to Agatha, and sat next to her; still, Agatha hadn't lifted her head, feeling thousands of emotions she had never imagined to experience that day.</p><p>"Agatha," her hand caressed her hair, "I don't want to force you — we can't talk about it if you want — just, I wanted you to know that you can tell me what happened."</p><p>There was a few minutes of silence; after a while, Agatha was staring at Rio, and Rio was staring back, calmy and patiently waiting for her to talk, or not talk, she didn't want to pressure her.</p><p>"I talked to her," her voice trembled, but she tried hard to appear fine; even if she wasn't.</p><p>"How did it go?"</p><p>Agatha sighed. "Terribly; I talked about changing the dating politics. At first, she didn't seem to care," she clenched her fists, "I thought: why would she care? So, she asked why I was so persistent in changing it."</p><p>Rio listened carefully — without ever removing her eyes.</p><p>"And, I lied–, I told her, because I thought that it would've been more efficient for couples to be together, help one another, and support each other in doing the very best, every day."</p><p>There was a long pause. "And?"</p><p>"She believed it; but then, she told me if this, changing, would've benefited me too — if I also wanted to date someone, some <em>men</em> of our department."</p><p>Rio noticed that tears were still streaming down her face, so her hand went on her cheek — brushing the tears off with her thumb, smiling at Agatha, who was surprised at that gesture. "And what next, Agatha?"</p><p>Agatha placed her hand over Rio's hand.</p><p>"I told her that I wasn't interested in men or dating any men; I didn't mean it to sound like a '<em>coming out</em>' — perhaps I was being too reckless, and she understood that I'm a lesbian. Which is true, but I didn't want her to know."</p><p>Rio caressed her cheek. The tears had stopped, even if her eyes were slightly watery. "She got angry?"</p><p>"Very; she told me that she wouldn't have changed the dating politics — she told me that she always knew — that she tried to set me up with men because, deep down, she feared not having a '<em>normal</em>' daughter."</p><p>Anger flowed in Rio's veins; she wanted to scream, to go to her mother, and slap her — but, of course, she had to restrain herself; for Agatha's safety, and well–being. So, the least she could do was listen to her.</p><p>"And—," Agatha continued, "I—, she told me that I was the cause of my parent's divorce; that I've always been a dirty, disgusting child, a failure to her, and the rest of the family."</p><p>"Agatha—"</p><p>"I don't even understand; I always did what she asked me — I even took the leads of this stupid company, I didn't want to! Rio, I hate this—"</p><p>Rio hugged Agatha; her arms wrapped around her — and Agatha hugged her back, tears streaming down, once more, and it wetted Rio's shirt, but she didn't mind; once the hug broke, their eyes met.</p><p>"Agatha, you're not disgusting, dirty or anything of that sort," she positioned her hand on Agatha's cheek, "I'm sorry you had to go through that, it pains me to see you cry and not being able to do much," she paused, then continued, "I want you to be happy — sometimes, people will be in your way, they'll like to see you suffer; but, you need to be strong, you need to choose yourself. You have to live for yourself, not for your mother."</p><p>"Rio–"</p><p>"And," she blocked Agatha from talking, positioning her hand on her lips, "I will always be there; whatever you decide, whatever you want to do — I'm going to never let you feel alone. Please, you're the most amazing person I've ever met — don't let her words get through you."</p><p>Agatha kissed Rio's hand, and she felt her worries flying away; she moved her hand away, and Agatha leaned in — kissing her on the lips, the kiss was needed, from both Agatha and Rio, they melted in each other's presence — and they kissed again and again, until Agatha had stopped.</p><p>"You always know how to cheer me up; I like that about you, Rio."</p><p>Agatha pinched Rio's cheeks — and Rio let out a small laugh.</p><p>But, soon — someone had knocked on the door. "Ms. Harkness, your mother sent me here — she wants to talk." It was Hela's voice, and Rio was surprised.</p><p>"Be careful, Agatha — don't let her words define who you are."</p><p>Agatha nodded. She pressed one last kiss on her lips; stood up, recomposed herself, checking if her hair were fine, or if her make–up needed adjustment. Everything was fine — she seemed fine. Rio sat still on the floor, trying to hide in the shadows, Hela knew about them; but Agatha didn't know she knew.</p><p>The CEO got out, thanked Hela, and walked back. After a while, Hela opened the door — she noticed Rio on the ground — smiled madly.</p><p>"I hope you didn't fuck here."</p><p>"We did <em>not</em> fuck! And it's <em>none</em> of your business!"</p><p>—</p><p>Things had gotten quieter; Agatha's mother had left the office hours and hours ago. Rio didn't know what happened, but there hadn't been nasty screams or anything of that sort.</p><p>Jen had almost finished her work; and Hela was relaxing with them — doing nothing but bothering them two.</p><p>"I was thinking," Jen spoke, "I wanted to get some drinks tonight; who's joining me?"</p><p>"It's not even the weekend?" Hela teased, but she was right — and Jen hated that, she wanted to punch her in the face.</p><p>"I know, but I really <em>fucking</em> need one."</p><p>"Fine, we can tell Alice and Billy to come," Rio joined the conversation; she also wanted to unwind — a drink might've helped.</p><p>"Who's Billy—"</p><p>"Billy has to study; we'll be us girls!"</p><p>Jen's excitement had managed to get to Rio and Hela. They both agreed — and worked even faster, hoping to end their work sooner than expected.</p><p>After a few minutes; Jen had finished her work, she waited for Rio and Hela. Rio gazed over the room where Agatha was in, and that didn't leave, not even to walk for a bit.</p><p>Rio stared at Hela, hoping she would've gotten the hint — luckily, she was smart enough to understand. Hela's hand went on Jen's shoulder. "Let's go, Jen!"</p><p>"What? How about Rio—"</p><p>"She needs to stay a bit longer; let's go and prepare ourselves for our drinking session."</p><p>Hela winked at Rio; and that was her clue — everyone had already left, so she entered Agatha's office. She was looking at the window, gazing at the dark sky — she had not noticed that Rio was inside.</p><p>She got closer to her, quietly and hoping not to make any sounds. Once behind Agatha, she covered her eyes with hands, laughing but pretending to be serious. "Who am I?"</p><p>Agatha laughed; her hands went over Rio's — she could've lied or told her the right answer.</p><p>"My <em>annoying</em> employee?"</p><p>Rio removed her hands — and Agatha turned around to face her; they both stared at each other, there were smiles on their lips.</p><p>"Correct!"</p><p>Agatha leaned in to kiss Rio, and she felt weak. Every time she kissed her, she always felt powerless and drunk of her. Rio was now the one interrupting the kiss; she stared at her.</p><p>"What happened? You didn't leave your office."</p><p>"Can we talk about it later? I'm still thinking of something; if you don't mind it."</p><p>Rio smiled. "Of course," suddenly, an idea had crossed her mind, "I was thinking–, would you like to meet my friends?"</p><p>"What? When?"</p><p>"Tonight; we're going out for drinks, I thought it'd be the best time for me to introduce you to them — only if you want to. To cheer you up!"</p><p>Agatha pondered for a while; she'd love to meet her friends, but was scared of what they might've thought of their relationship, of their approval. But, Rio seemed happy, and she wanted to keep seeing her happy.</p><p>"Alright — I'd love to meet them."</p><p>Rio beamed up and hugged her.</p><p>"Just to let you know; two of them work here — but don't worry, they won't tell a soul. Or I'll kill them on the spot, trust me!"</p><p>Agatha was worried, but she trusted Rio's words.</p><p>"It's okay — it'd be awkward, but I can handle it."</p><p>"I'll text you the details later; I have to rush home and get ready," she broke the hug, "I'll see you later?"</p><p>"Yes, don't worry."</p><p>Rio waved at her; running towards the exit — Agatha was alone, wondering if she had made the right choice.</p>

<p>Alice, Hela, Jen, and Rio were outside of the bar — waiting for someone, even if they didn't know who. Rio was nervous; and her friends had noticed it, something had to be done. But what?</p><p>"So, hm," Jen spoke, looking for Alice's approval — she was as confused as her, but was better at hiding it. "Did you recruit a new member?"</p><p>Rio's eyes met hers; she took a deep breath.</p><p>"Tonight; I'll introduce you to my <em>girlfriend</em>."</p><p>Alice was in pure shock, but so was Jen; Hela didn't react much — she simply giggled because she knew the whole truth. Jen was about to yell, but Alice was faster to speak.</p><p>"Who the <em>hell</em> are you dating? You never mentioned her?!"</p><p>"Exactly; who stole your heart — she must be a witch!"</p><p>Alice laughed. "Right? What's going on?"</p><p>The duo couldn't stop making jokes about it — Rio stared at Hela, who was surprisingly calm, being the only one that wasn't teasing her; she was glad because her nerves were about to pop.</p><p>Soon, Jen had noticed a figure; Agatha's figure, walking towards them — maybe she had somewhere to be, even she had a life, after all. Alice also had spotted Agatha, they stared at each other — Hela was the last one to see her, and it was now that a smile appeared on her lips.</p><p>After a few seconds, Agatha had arrived, stopping right next to Rio; Jen was sweating, Alice was confused, and Hela thought of how things had suddenly turned serious.</p><p>"Ms. Harkness—," Jen broke the silence, "I didn't know you were the type of person to be at these bars; what brings you here?"</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio; and she, calmy, looked at them three.</p><p>"Girls–," she felt her heart skip a beat, but with Agatha there, she felt safer, "I'm introducing Agatha — my girlfriend."</p><p>—</p><p>After the sudden wave of shock, after many gasps and unsaid things — they entered the bar, sitting at a table; waiting for their drinks. Rio's friends were staring at Agatha, and she looked worried — their stares were so intense, confused yet incredulous. Hela was the only one focused on the menù; she really didn't mind.</p><p>After a while of those stares, Rio snapped.</p><p>"Can you stop looking at her? You're making her uncomfortable!"</p><p>"Are we supposed not to stare?" Jen teased, and that made Rio even more angry; she sighed, immediately, she glared at Jen, then at Alice.</p><p>"Is there <em>something</em> wrong?"</p><p>"Nothing's wrong," Alice reassured her — and, somehow, it managed to calm Rio. "We have the right to be curious. How did it happen? When? Why?"</p><p>Agatha had not spoken much; but, in that instance, she thought of clarifying their doubts — they were right, they deserved to know, to have some answers.</p><p>"It's okay, Rio — I understand them, I'd be freaking out too," she smiled at her, holding her hand gently. "I can tell how it happened, if you don't mind listening."</p><p>"<em>Wohoo</em>, backstory time," Hela laughed; getting bad stares from both Alice and Jen.</p><p>"So," Agatha cleared her voice, "I will keep it short; we met at Rio's previous workplace, I thought she was weird but interesting — then, we met once again in a pub," their eyes were captivated by her, ears keen on listening, "I helped her to sober up; it didn't work — she tried to kiss me, but she was drunk and I stopped her," she found herself smiling, and Rio wanted to disappear. "Then, I kept thinking about her, more than usual; she kept appearing in my mind, dreams — and I wanted to be closer to her. So—, we clarified our differences, went on a date, and it was very nice. We then fought, I realised how stupid I had been — I apologised, we started dating shortly after."</p><p>Rio giggled; hearing their whole story had brought her a sense of nostalgia, they really had gone through a lot — and it was even the small version of their story.</p><p>"I can't believe it," Jen spoke, "Rio had a better love story than me — what the <em>actual</em> fuck?"</p><p>"You'll get used to it," Alice answered, but she was smiling; she looked at Rio in a very proud, satisfied way — and Rio noticed her, smiling back. There was a mutual understanding.</p><p>"Congrats, boss," Hela laughed; and Agatha tried to smile back — but she was embarrassed.</p><p>Rio was happy — Agatha looked serene; so, she stood up, all of the sudden. "The drinks are taking a lot; I'll check out if they are ready."</p><p>She stared at Jen and Alice, especially at Hela. "Don't say weird stuff to her."</p><p>Then, she went to the counter; Agatha was alone with Rio's friends. She felt awkward and shy — but, who wouldn't have felt that way? She cleared her throat.</p><p>"Have you been friends for a long time?"</p><p>Jen smiled. "Yes, Agatha—, Ms. Harkness—, Agatha?"</p><p>Agatha knew how tense she might've been. "Agatha is fine; Kale—, Jennifer?"</p><p>"Oh my God," Alice stepped in, "I'm sorry, and yes! I've been friends with her since college, Jen soon after, and Hela–," she looked at her, "I still don't know."</p><p>Hela felt offended. "What a great friend you are, Alice."</p><p>Agatha couldn't help but laugh; and the three stared at her.</p><p>"Thanks for being friends with Rio," she appeared to be distracted, "I haven't been there in her darkest times, but I'll be there for the times that will come. Thank you for trusting me."</p><p>"Oh, Agatha," Alice was about to cry, "I will <em>destroy</em> her ass if she hurts you; don't worry."</p><p>That statement worried Agatha; but she didn't think Rio would've done that.</p><p>"Also, I want to thank you," Alice took the chance to speak, "I've noticed how happy Rio is; she is taking your relationship seriously — and I can't believe how mature she has become. She's doing better; with someone she loves, a job she likes — I couldn't think of something more perfect. So, thank you for letting Rio become the best version of herself. You have my approval."</p><p>Agatha was moved by such words, her eyes were shaking; she didn't expect to receive such comfort, especially from her friends. She smiled and nodded quickly.</p><p>"Has this become a therapy session?"</p><p>Hela asked; breaking the seriousness of the moment — and Jen punched her, Hela whining in response.</p><p>Rio returned to the table. "Okay, I fought with the waiter; he's gonna come soon," she sat, next to Agatha, who was smiling, as the rest of her friends. "So, what's going on? Were you talking bad about me?"</p><p>Agatha laughed, pulling Rio closer and sealing a kiss on her cheek. "I realised how <em>lucky</em> I am to be your girlfriend."</p><p>Everyone was on the verge of tears — Rio was shocked, she didn't expect Agatha to kiss her, in front of her friends — she didn't mind, of course. And she had also called her '<em>girlfriend</em>', it was the first time she had done that; she had never imagined it to happen so soon.</p><p>"Agatha," she looked in her eyes, "I can't control myself when you kiss me."</p><p>"What are you even saying?" Agatha looked flustered; but she knew that it was just Rio's teasing her — in front of her friends.</p><p>"Rio, is it hard to not be weird for a second?"</p><p>Jen sighed; the drinks had arrived — they smiled, cheered, and toasted to the new beginnings.</p><p>—</p><p>Once the evening was over; they left the bar — everyone was satisfied, happy to have gotten to know Agatha better.</p><p>Jen and Hela had reassured Agatha that they wouldn't have said anything; and they'd try not to let anyone spread rumours — which was very much appreciated.</p><p>"Thank you for tonight," Agatha said, looking at everyone, "I'm glad I was able to know you."</p><p>They all simultaneously said a few words of encouragement, and Alice looked at Rio. It was time to head home — but, Rio had to do one more thing.</p><p>"I'll walk Agatha to her car — you can go without me, Alice."</p><p>Alice nodded; the three walking towards their own houses. Rio turned around, she stretched her hand, and Agatha smiled and went to hold it; they rarely held hands, but it felt so right.</p><p>As they both started walking, Rio could feel how happy Agatha was — she'd wished for that to last.</p><p>"I think it went okay," Agatha said, looking at Rio, who was immersed in her thoughts; seemed to be in her own world.</p><p>"It went great; they adore you, and I couldn't be more happy."</p><p>The two of them arrived at the car; Agatha stopped, and so did Rio. They stared at each other — there were times when Agatha had given up on finding someone that would've loved her, but those times were now a distant and bitter memory.</p><p>"I'm happy that you have such caring friends."</p><p>Rio smiled; she leaned in, her lips almost touching — they breathed at the same pace.</p><p>"And I'm glad to have <em>you</em> as my girlfriend."</p><p>Agatha had never felt like that before; those feelings, the rush of being together, the understandings — it was new, it was beautiful. She didn't want it to end, ever, and she would've fought hard to keep that peace she had so much wished for; for herself, and for Rio.</p><p>She put her hands around her waist, pulling Rio closer — lips united; they kissed for minutes, catching random breaks to get some air, only to kiss again. Agatha was happy — her hands sliding to Rio's ass, hearing a moan from the younger one. Then, she pushed her away — <em>playfully</em> — leaving Rio with many questions</p><p>"Why—"</p><p>"I have to get home; Lilia is going to kill me if she doesn't get rest — and Nicky has to go to school tomorrow," she explained, and Rio understood, even if she felt irritated to have been pushed away during their moment.</p><p>"Always so responsible," Rio got closer to her, "I'll let it slide; get home safe, text me when you get there."</p><p>"I will."</p><p>Rio's cheeks were slightly red, feeling embarrassed about what she was about to say. "I'll <em>miss</em> you."</p><p>Agatha laughed. "We'll see each other tomorrow, at work. Can't stay away from me for the whole night?"</p><p>There was a smirk on Rio's lips. "I'll try."</p><p>They kissed, one more time — Agatha entered the car, starting the engine, and, as she was getting away, Rio gazed at the stars; things were going so well, and she couldn't stop thinking of how <em>much</em> her life had changed.</p>

<p>Weeks had passed, and everything seemed perfect; Rio and Agatha saw each other frequently, stealing glances and, occasionally, would meet up in the storage — recharging batteries, <em>kissing</em>.</p><p>It seemed like a dream, even though Agatha was still worrying about one thing; having to keep Rio hidden from her mother, her employees, and everything. She was still debating on what to do — Rio didn't pressure her — she would've waited until her decision was made.</p><p>They spoke briefly on what Agatha's mother had said after; she had warned her to be careful, but Agatha didn't understand and let it slide, hoping it was a vague threat.</p><p>Work seemed more intense than usual; it was the second time that Rio had an impressive amount of work, she didn't mind. Jen was typing on the computer, and Rio, too.</p><p>Suddenly — Rio had gotten a text from Agatha; which was weird. She never texted her during work hours, and something must've happened. So, she read the text and giggled after — Agatha had told her to come up with an excuse and meet her in her office.</p><p>Luckily, Rio had always been good at improvising. She piled up a few papers, putting them in a folder; the plan was to let the others think that she had to report something to Agatha — it would've worked.</p><p>She stood up from the chair — folder in her hands, Jen staring at her. "Where are you going?"</p><p>"I have to report something to the boss–!"</p><p>Jen knew it was a lie but was too busy with her work to argue; in fact, everyone would've been too busy to notice Rio — and that made things even better.</p><p>She walked towards the office, knocking and, after getting permission to go in, she rushed inside. Agatha looked tired, more than usual — stressed, worried.</p><p>Rio smiled, closing the door behind her, heading towards the desk of the CEO, slamming the (useless) folder on it. Agatha's gaze met hers — even that simple movement tore her out.</p><p>"Did something happen? We never meet in your office," Rio's fingers tapped on the desk. "Not that I mind, of course."</p><p>"Rio," Agatha sighed, "I'm dealing with so much stress; work, paperwork and you know, finding out a way to not hide us forever," she took a deep breath, "I thought that, seeing you, even for a brief moment, would've made me feel calm."</p><p>Rio walked past the desk, reaching her; with a hasty movement, she sat on Agatha's lap, her arms wrapped around her neck — gently delivering a kiss on her cheeks. "Oh, Agatha," her eyes stared at hers, "I find you so adorable when you're like this."</p><p>Agatha laughed, placing her hands on Rio's thighs as they gently kissed — slowly, steadily, and without any rush.</p><p>"Say," Rio teased, "I thought of a way to let you relax — a more <em>efficient</em> way."</p><p>There was a hint of curiosity, mixed to doubts in Agatha's eyes — she didn't understand what she was planning.</p><p>"Which is?"</p><p>Rio's hand went to her trousers, her fingers around the zip of the pants; she smiled at Agatha, and she, in response, began blushing subtly — not having anything to say to <em>such</em> bold action.</p><p>"Rio, wait," words were hard to find, "I–, what if someone hears us?"</p><p>"That means you'll have to be quiet. You can do that, can you?"</p><p>Agatha had seen Rio being straightforward, many times — she couldn't believe what she wanted to do, it made Agatha's stomach twirl, her senses going numb. She just had to be quiet? She could've done that.</p><p>"Be quick."</p><p>Rio smiled. She was about to unzip her pants, kneeling down, knees on the floor — when, suddenly, she had heard some loud, heavy steps heading towards the room. Immediately, she got up — Agatha stared at her, confused, as she was eagerly waiting.</p><p>The door opened; someone had entered in, and Agatha froze on the spot — it was her mother. Her mother's eyes were on Agatha, then on Rio. She slammed the door behind her, she appeared to have something in her hands: <em>a folder</em>.</p><p>"Mother?" Agatha tried to be cool, as if she wasn't one second away from getting laid by Rio — she had to return to reality; her mother was there, meaning nothing but trouble.</p><p>She walked closer to Agatha's desk, and Rio stood there — not knowing what to do. Did she have to walk away? Stay with Agatha?</p><p>The mother put the folder on the desk. "Take a look."</p><p>Agatha did exactly as she was told; she held it in her hands, opening it and, oh — there were pictures, photos of her and Rio, kissing near her car — must've been from their hangout at the bar, Agatha had let her guard down. Rio also peeked at the photos; she was scared but couldn't have said anything.</p><p>"You sent someone to follow me."</p><p>Her voice was weak — Rio wanted to do something. But, her mother was there, and things weren't easy.</p><p>"I did," she got closer to her daughter, "I thought about what we discussed about. Changing the dating politics? It was weird, absurd," her eyes lingered on Rio, "I now understand — you decided to throw <em>everything</em> away for this woman. What do you see in her? She's younger and she is probably using you. Not only are you disgusting, but you're also stupid."</p><p>She was trembling, more than so. "Mother, leave her out of this — please."</p><p>"Why should I care of one little bitch—"</p><p>Agatha had stood up, her hand had hit the desk; her knuckles hitting the hard material — Rio flinched as she hurried to see if her hand was fine.</p><p>"Don't ever call her that. You have <em>no idea</em> what kind of person she is; worse, you don't care. You never cared—"</p><p><em>A slap</em>; her mother had slapped Agatha. The sound was brutal, neat, and horrendous. Rio had enough. She positioned herself in front of Agatha's — shielding her. Her eyes were firm, anger flowing in her veins.</p><p>"Get the <em>fuck</em> out."</p><p>"You don't tell me—"</p><p>"Get out! Before I make a scene; I'll have all of the employees here, I'll call the security — I'll make sure you'll remember this day."</p><p>She took a few steps back; Rio was furious, and wasn't all talks — she would've done that. </p><p>"I'll be away for a while, but trust me," her eyes met the ones of Agatha's — they were fierce, evil, and incredibly cruel, "I won't let this slide; there'll be <em>consequences</em> for what you've done."</p><p>The mother looked now at Rio, then, she left the room.</p><p>Rio turned around; she stared at Agatha's face. There was the mark of her mother's hand, and her skin was red.</p><p>"Rio—"</p><p>Her hand went over Agatha's cheek; the skin was burning. What infuriated Rio was how she was pretending that everything was fine — making her think that there had been other times when she had been hit.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Rio."</p><p>"It hurts, right?"</p><p>Agatha couldn't lie to her.</p><p>"No, not that much," she sighed, "I'm used to it."</p><p>"You're 'used to it'?" Rio caressed her cheek; there were many things she wanted to say, but most of them seemed stupid — she feared upsetting her.</p><p>"Yes, she does this — often."</p><p>Rio was broken; she felt stupid to not have realised Agatha's situation sooner — the mental abuse, the physical one — it was hard to watch, and she would've given her everything if that meant letting Agatha live peacefully.</p><p>"Rio, get back to your seat."</p><p>She snapped. "Are you serious? I can't leave you, not like this!"</p><p>"People will start to worry; they'll be suspicious — my mother has made so much noise, I don't want to cause any more stress."</p><p>"Fuck what they think—!"</p><p>"Rio," Agatha's hand went on Rio's, her eyes distant. "I'm asking you."</p><p>Rio knew that she couldn't protest; so, she nodded. "We'll talk later, just— don't keep things to yourself."</p><p>With a few steps, she left the room.</p><p>—</p><p>As expected — the employees had many questions for Rio, but Jen did her best to send them away. Rio was immersed in her thoughts; she stared at the clock of the office, a few more minutes, and there would've been the lunch break.</p><p>"Rio," Jen spoke soflty, "I don't want to pressure you, but what happened?"</p><p>She didn't reply — her gaze lingering on the clock.</p><p>"I saw Agatha's mom; she was angry, furious. Did she–?"</p><p>Lunch break arrived; the clock had hit its hour — Rio stood up, ignoring Jen, as she rushed to Agatha's door, without knocking, she entered. Agatha was working, and she hadn't noticed her.</p><p>"Agatha," Rio said, finally having her attention on her. "It's lunch break; you and I, lunch together."</p><p>"But, Rio— I have to finish some stuff."</p><p>"Now."</p><p>Agatha left her paperwork; she stood up, reaching where Rio was. "Where are we going? The cafeteria?"</p><p>"No," Rio smiled, "I, you, all of us, have thirty minutes of break; we're going to get something tasty — walk, and," she hesited, "and talk."</p><p>"Please, tell me you don't want an ice cream."</p><p>She laughed; but no, that wasn't the plan.</p><p>"There's a new place, not that far from here. They sell sweets — but not too sweet."</p><p>"Oh, so not that different from ice cream."</p><p>Rio could've laughed, but, instead, she took her hands, but let go after a while. "You need something to cheer up. Let's go."</p><p>And they both proceeded to walk outside.</p><p>—</p><p>The place was nearby — thankfully, they walked for a little bit; Rio and Agatha spoke briefly about trivial stuff, work, and such.</p><p>Once at the shop, there were many delicacies. From pieces of cakes, to croissants, to doughnuts, and many, many other stuff. Agatha looked at the food. She had some trouble deciding what to take, while Rio watched Agatha — carefully.</p><p>"The apple pie looks good," Agatha smiled, "I think I'm taking that one. How about you?"</p><p>"Same."</p><p>Rio hurried to take two pieces, as she quickly paid before Agatha could. That made the older woman surprised — the food was pricey (for who knows what reasons), and she wouldn't have minded paying for herself, but Rio had other plans.</p><p>The employee there gave them two pieces, along with plastic forks and tissues; then, they thanked, and walked out. They spotted a nearby bench, and sat on it.</p><p>Agatha opened the box, which had the cake inside — the fork was in her hand, ready to dig in but, Rio wasn't doing anything, just staring at her.</p><p>She knew what it meant. "We can talk."</p><p>"Agatha," she began, "I wish for you to tell me everything."</p><p>"Like I told you — my mother is strict, and she expects the very best from me," her gaze was distant, "I followed her every order, perfectly, but — I realised that this <em>can't</em> go on any longer."</p><p>Rio breathed slowly. "What are you going to do?"</p><p>"I've been thinking; I want my freedom, I want what I deserve — I'm <em>forty</em>, and I'm heading towards a particular age of my life, where I can't simply satisfy her any longer."</p><p>It was right, Rio agreed to what she was saying. She had wasted most of her life following her mother's desires, there was nothing wrong to want something for her.</p><p>"And I agree with you, Agatha."</p><p>"And I," Agatha bit her lip, "I've decided to <em>quit</em> being the CEO."</p><p>Rio's eyes widened — she knew Agatha had been thinking about it, but wouldn't have ever imagined that she would've told her so soon.</p><p>"I support you, Agatha — you're prioritising yourself!"</p><p>"I'm not done," her hands clenched on the tiny box, "I've also been thinking of moving away; it's not that I want to run away from my problems, Im also doing this to protect Nicky. You see, before he was born, my mother put me through hell — and, to this day, he still treats him poorly. But now that she knows everything, I can only imagine the things she's going to do," Agatha looked at Rio's eyes, the brown ones were in pure shock, "I have to <em>protect</em> my son; and I also have to watch my back — I'll disappear from her sight, I'll make sure that she never, ever finds me."</p><p>Rio lowered her gaze; what about their relationship?</p><p>"I know what you're thinking," Agatha had managed to read into her mind; all of her worries, and questions, and Rio felt bad for having been caught thinking of something so selfish. "What about us?"</p><p>"Agatha—"</p><p>"Rio," Agatha put the box on the bench, besides her, "I thought of you; I always do," her hands took the ones of the youngest, "I was blinded by rage when she called you that. I was so mad — I couldn't see properly, I couldn't think of what to do. When she hit me, and you stepped in; I realised how much I care about you, more than anything."</p><p>She squeezed her hands. "I understood what it meant to feel loved; you make me feel loved every day," she smiled, her gaze meeting hers, "I have to go, and I can't ask you to come with me. That'll be selfish, you have your friends here, your memories, places you love — I don't want you to throw it away for me."</p><p>Rio understood what she meant.</p><p>"Because I care for you that I want you to stay here; live your life, don't risk it all for me — I have a time to organise the whole thing: to fire myself, search a place where to go, a school for Nicky, and all of the other stuff. I have time, and let's make the most of it."</p><p>"What if I <em>wanted</em> to go with you?"</p><p>Agatha had a disappointed look in her eyes; she knew that Rio was young, she had to face many experiences, many new and bad things — she couldn't have taken that away from her — not her youth.</p><p>"I won't allow it."</p><p>"But, Agatha–"</p><p>"No, Rio," she let go of her hands, "I don't want you to do that for me, I want you to experience as many things as possible; this is my choice, not yours."</p><p>Rio should've listened to her; she was right — she had her friends there, things she loved, but she also loved Agatha, and would've been wrong for her to stand there and watch her go.</p><p>"Where are you planning to go?"</p><p>"Perhaps, another country."</p><p>'Another country', it seemed like a fever dream, one from where you would wake up sweaty, messy, and confused.</p><p>"And it means that–?"</p><p>"Rio, there's a lot of time; let's enjoy our time together — when the time will come, we'll see what to do."</p><p>That didn't satisfy Rio at all; she knew that Agatha was hard to convince, but Rio had her ways. For now, she would've let it go — tomorrow, she would've thought of a way to make her change her mind; she could ask for advice.</p><p>"Fine," Rio said, feeling not 'fine' at all.</p><p>She would've played it cool.</p><p>Agatha took the little box back in her hands, staring at the little piece of cake; Rio stared at her — quickly, she took a piece of cake with her fork, laughing.</p><p>"Can I feed you?"</p><p>Agatha smiled, rolling her eyes; she expected Rio to be angry, mad even, but for her, to propose such thing, must've meant that she was processing it well.</p><p>"I'm capable of feeding myself, thanks."</p><p>"But that's what couples do; I'm just trying to be romantic here," the fork was near her lips, "I even choose the same thing as you, so that we could do this."</p><p>She sighed and opened her mouth; feeling ashamed and embarrassed even. Why did couples even do that? But Rio wanted to, and she really couldn't say no.</p><p>"Say '<em>ahhh</em>'."</p><p>Agatha refused to, but soon, Rio put the piece of cake in her mouth. She looked around (to see if anyone suspicious was there) and, after making sure they were alone; she leaned closer to her, leaving a kiss on her lips — Agatha was caught by surprise, and Rio smiled to see her reaction.</p><p>"This was your plan all along?" Agatha swallowed the food as she began feeling flustered; she tried to hide the fact that she was blushing, hoping Rio wouldn't have teased her.</p><p>"Who knows?"</p><p>"Just don't choke me next time."</p><p>Rio laughed. "There'll be other times where I could think of chocking you–"</p><p>"Rio, stop."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The week–end arrived. It was a Saturday morning when Rio had called all of her friends for a '<em>talk</em>'; it was unsual for her to do so, usually, it meant that something serious had happened — because Rio rarely talked about her feelings, let alone her worries.</p><p>When the four of them (including Billy) had arrived at a nearby café — Rio was there, sitting, alone, waiting for them to sit with her; she looked distressed, as if she hadn't slept for days.</p><p>"Uh, should we—,?" Hela said; looking at them, and they truly didn't know what to do, they had never seen her in that state, especially Alice.</p><p>"Don't worry, guys," Billy joined, reassuring them all, "I think that, if she feels safe to talk about it, then we shouldn't worry."</p><p>Hela and Billy had recently met, but there was a mutual understanding from both parts; he was majoring in psychology and she used psychology tricks to get clients to sign the contracts — somehow, it managed them to get along (efficiently).</p><p>Alice and Jen nodded; so, they all walked towards the table — sitting on the chairs, staring at Rio — waiting for her to talk, say anything.</p><p>"Rio," Jen was the one to speak, trying to lift the seriousness that felt heavy, uncomfortable, "I have to say, this new <em>sleepless</em> look suits you!"</p><p>"Guys," she ignored her, totally, and drastically so, "I have a problem with my girlfriend."</p><p>They all looked at her; Billy was in pure shock, no one had told him — because he hadn't read the texts, nor talked to them — his amount of studies were way too big to manage.</p><p>"When did you even get a girlfriend?! Who's this girl?"</p><p>Jen laughed. She, too, had been in his shoes. "Oh, right. You missed a chapter — let me fill you in."</p><p>She began explaining the whole thing, Billy was hypnotised by her words — a story that seemed absurd yet very real; it was when she had mentioned her name that he, loudly, gasped.</p><p>"Rio is dating Agatha Harkness?!"</p><p>"Yeah," Hela sighed, twirling her hair, "Rio is one lucky bastard."</p><p>Billy looked concerned, panicked, to say the least. "She's my mom's friend."</p><p>Everyone's eyes — even Rio, surprisingly — were on him, stealing her (dramatic) moment. There were many questions to be asked, but Billy was hesitant, fearing himself.</p><p>"Wanda is your mom?!" Rio was able to say, shock having the best on her — breaking the tension — the news was non–sense, even more absurd.</p><p>"Yeah," there was a nervous laugh from him, "I got to know Ms. Harkness, she scares me, but I can't say that to my mom."</p><p>"My girlfriend is not scary — watch your <em>fucking</em> tongue."</p><p>Billy flinched — Alice coughed, trying to save him from inevitable and certain death, she stared at Rio, with a comforting smile.</p><p>"So, Rio, what did you want to talk about?"</p><p>Rio looked at her — she breathed, in and out. Was telling them the right thing to do? She knew they wouldn't have told a soul, and she did need advice. A loud sigh, then she parted her lips.</p><p>"Agatha is moving away."</p><p>A round of gasps — even Hela, which hard to impress. Rio knew that it was a lot, but it was what the reality she was dealing with.</p><p>"Where?" Alice was speechless, looking at her. "Why?"</p><p>"Guys," Rio looked serious, deadly serious, "I have to make sure you won't tell a soul; I need you to keep quiet about what I'm about to say. If I even hear a word about it, I'm going to—"</p><p>"Rio," Jen sounded really annoyed, "I never ever broke your trust, nor did Alice, Billy, and Hela. Don't <em>even</em> go there."</p><p>Rio knew she was right, she started feeling bad; her friends couldn't do something like that — maybe the stress was getting to her.</p><p>"Agatha's mother found out she's gay, found out about our relationship and she," it hurt her to remember what she had seen, her hands were trembling and her friends noticed, "I–, she sent someone to follow us; there were pictures of us and her mother," Rio's heart was heavy, so her words, so her thoughts, "she <em>hit</em> her."</p><p>The look in their eyes was hard to describe; fear mixed to anger, anger mixed to anxiety — they were quiet, and the silence felt uncomfortable because Rio had gathered a lot of courage so, they had to say something, at the very least.</p><p>"Rio," Alice's hand went to take hers, "I'm so, so happy that you decided to trust us; it must've been hard to deal with that by yourself — you're not alone, remember this."</p><p>Her brown eyes soon filled with tears; she rarely cried, when she did, it meant that Rio was at her limits — no one judged her, laughed, or anything — they were all there, understanding.</p><p>"She's moving away because she wants to obtain her freedom, start a new and better life — for herself and her beautiful son," her tears reached her cheeks, flowing down, "I told her that I would've gone with her; she said no, that it'd be wrong, because I have my friends here and all of my memories."</p><p>Hela slammed her hand on the table, Rio's gaze meeting hers — she seemed sad, but also angry; everyone was starting to get confused, more than Rio.</p><p>"Rio," her voice was fueled by thousands of emotions, "I didn't know that I'd be the one saying this — you really want to stay in this <em>shitty</em> town and not follow her?"</p><p>"But, what about you guys?"</p><p>"What about 'us'?" she got up the chair, "I, all of us, wants you to be happy; it's true that we'll miss you, a lot — but don't let us stop you, we'll be happy whatever you decide. Agatha makes you happy, you love her, do you?"</p><p>Rio had never admitted her feelings so passionately — her cheeks were slightly rosy. "I do."</p><p>"You want to be together for a long time?"</p><p>"Yes, of course — I'm happy with her."</p><p>Hela got closer to her. "Then, why the fuck are you crying? You have to convince her to let her know that you will go with her — and that's final."</p><p>"She told me no, I can't—"</p><p>"And you let one little '<em>no</em>' stop you?!" Her hand clenched, nails on the hard material, "I didn't know you could give up so easily."</p><p>Those words, spoken in such harsh and hard way, actually managed to get to Rio; she never knew how persuasive Hela could be — it was scary, but she needed it. So, she took a deep breath and dried her tears away.</p><p>"I'll talk to her again."</p><p>Alice smiled, and so did Jen, Billy. Of course, they agreed with Hela — though her manners were rude — they could sense her worries and appreciated how she was able to move Rio.</p><p>"Wow, Hela, didn't know you could be so mean," Billy smiled, making his friends laugh — the atmosphere had gotten less tense, more calm; Rio felt calmer.</p><p>"So–," Jen eased up the tension even more, "I think it's too early for drinks; shall we have coffee?"</p><p>—</p><p>It was evening; Agatha had told Wanda and Lilia to meet her for dinner — they rarely had time for themselves, but for Agatha to have called them; must've meant that there was something going on. And there was.</p><p>They sat on the chairs; the food had arrived — but the two of them waited for Agatha to speak.</p><p>"So, what's the occasion?" Lilia said, as she took a sip from her glass — fine red wine.</p><p>Wanda stared at Agatha, so did Lilia; they started to worry, as she had not spoke to them yet — what was going on?</p><p>"Agatha—?"</p><p>"I'm going to quit being the CEO."</p><p>Lilia put the glass down, and Wanda had an enigmatic look on her face; they had many questions, as they should — but, Agatha had not say the whole truth.</p><p>Her eyes looked at them both. "I'm also thinking of moving away."</p><p>Wanda now gasped, Lilia had to step in.</p><p>"Agatha. What's going on?"</p><p>Agatha sighed, in her hands, she held the glass of wine; the liquid was cold, but it managed to calm her down. "I'm sure you're aware of the situation between me and my mother; of what she did to me, right?"</p><p>"Yes, of course. You don't need to repeat that, go on," Wanda had answered — Lilia gave an understanding nod, and Agatha felt her heart increasing its beat; the hard part had yet to come.</p><p>"Before I explain everything, there's something I need to tell you; I'm dating someone from the company," the look in her eyes wan unreadable; surprised mixed to shock, she had to continue. "And it's a <em>girl</em>."</p><p>Wanda smiled. "Vidal?"</p><p>"Definitely her," Lilia tagged along; her lips curled, and gazing at Agatha — who was trying her best to not blush.</p><p>"What makes you think that I'm dating her?"</p><p>Lilia was now giggling, the red–head too; Agatha's confusion grew, and so did her embarrassment — the duo didn't seem to stop.</p><p>"You guys weren't exactly subtle," Wanda said, still laughing, Agatha wanted to disappear — and Lilia tried her best to not worsen her mood.</p><p>"What do you mean—?"</p><p>"Agatha," Lilia was calm, meaning that she was serious, "Vidal keeps spending time with you at lunch, you disappear every opportunity you get, and also, the coffee accident — who goes in two to search for a shirt?"</p><p>The icy eyes were still; and her cheeks of a reddish colour — Agatha hated getting caught — had other employees also understood the whole situation? What to do?</p><p>"The storage is big—"</p><p>Wanda groaned. "Come on! We're not stupid."</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, trying hard to fight the thousands of emotions inside her — she knew that they meant well, but what about her professionality? It was confusing.</p><p>"Fine. Do you think that I—," there were doubts raising inside of her; the words of her mother appearing in her mind — she shook her head, and suddenly, she had to know. "I mean—, do you think she's using me? Because she's younger, and I'm not?"</p><p>Her words didn't make sense — Rio wouldn't have ever used her, ever, but Evanora's voice echoed inside of her; a spell she had hoped to forget.</p><p>Lilia looked at Wanda. There was a moment of silence; they didn't understand entirely, but knew Agatha's words weren't hers — but her from someone else.</p><p>"No," Wanda said, with comforting eyes, "I don't think she's like that. I've met her, she's genuinely a good person — doesn't care about your status, money, and such. She cares about you, and you only."</p><p>Agatha sighed — they were right.</p><p>"Can I ask you why you want to quit being the CEO, and why you want to move away?" Lilia had to press in; there were urgent matters to discuss — Agatha knew it and felt bad to have said it last.</p><p>"My mother—, she keeps wanting to control me; I'm tired of it, so, so tired. I need to get my life back — I never wanted to be the CEO, I just went with it because she wanted to," Agatha took a deep breath, "I wanted to please her, but I realised that she'll never be satisfied with anything — so, I was thinking of moving away — not only for me, but for Nicholas; she has always been so horrible to him, and he has so many questions."</p><p>Wanda was confused, and so was Lilia; the two wanted to say something, but she had to finish what she was saying.</p><p>"And, she found out I'm dating Rio; I don't even want to imagine what she will do — to her, or to him. I have to, I need to keep him safe. She'll be away for a while — I have enough time to organise everything."</p><p>"Is that what you want?" Lilia asked; she had teary eyes — and Agatha understood. For her, Agatha was like a daughter she never had — she had raised her, treated her like her own, taught her stuff, and was the first person she had come out to. It was impossible to remain calm.</p><p>"It is what I must do to protect him and for me."</p><p>Wanda's hand went over Lilia's shoulder — attempting at comforting her; and the woman appreciated the gesture, as she couldn't show her true emotions — she knew Agatha wasn't stupid, and respected her wishes.</p><p>"Alright, Agatha. You can resign on monday; we'll prepare everything," Wanda, too, had watery eyes, but she knew that Agatha had made up her mind, and it was for the best. "But, who's going to be the next CEO?"</p><p>Lilia pondered, eyes on Wanda. "The best option is you, but the decision is up to you."</p><p>"Oh, well—, it was about time I received a promotion," Wanda laughed; bringing back the humorous atmosphere of before, "I'll do it."</p><p>Agatha sighed. "It's a lot; I don't want you to feel forced—"</p><p>"I'm not forced, I <em>really</em> want to."</p><p>Wanda shushed her, and she made a tiny smile — they proceeded to drink wine — attempting to drop the conversation; it was hard for Lilia, so Wanda and Agatha knew it.</p><p>Lilia looked at Agatha. "I hope you find the peace you so much want."</p><p>"I hope so too."</p><p>—</p><p>Lilia had to get home earlier; so, Agatha and Wanda stood outside of the dining place — the air was chilly, and they both were freezing.</p><p>"Vision is going to be here soon—"</p><p>"That's fine; I'll wait for him with you."</p><p>Then, silence — Agatha glanced at Wanda, and her expressions were hard to understand. They hadn't asked that many questions, perhaps they didn't want for her to suffer the decision.</p><p>"So, Rio, huh?"</p><p>Agatha slightly coughed, trying not to sound embarrassed. "Yes, are you surprised?"</p><p>"Not really. She's cute and smart, knows what she's doing — I've been hoping for you two!"</p><p>Wanda spoke of as entertained by the whole thing, and Agatha couldn't deny that — her own situation — could be seen in a very funny way; she didn't think much of it.</p><p>"Thank you for supporting me, Lilia too."</p><p>They smiled at each other; Wanda knew that she meant that — she had never received support from her parents but was lucky to have found them.</p><p>"She isn't going with you, is she—"</p><p>Soon; a car had stopped nearby, Wanda beamed up — that was her husband, and she was smiling widely.</p><p>"Agatha?"</p><p>"You <em>should</em> go."</p><p>Agatha obviously didn't want to talk about her leaving Rio — Wanda respected that.</p><p>"Want to come and say hi?"</p><p>Agatha smiled. "I'll pass, but you do that for me, alright?"</p><p>Wanda nodded, looking at Agatha, longer than usual — she had to say something.</p><p>"Agatha," a tiny smile, yet so powerful, "I hope everything goes your way; you deserve it — you deserve happiness, so does Nicholas."</p><p>That was the reassurance she needed.</p><p>"Thank you, Wanda."</p>

<p>The week–end was about to end; Agatha had decided to invite Rio at her place — for a dinner, allowing themselves to spend time together.</p><p>So, when Rio had knocked on her door, and Agatha had rushed to open up — it was surprising to the older one's eyes to see that she had brought a bottle of wine, and something was in a little box.</p><p>"You didn't have to get the wine; I have plenty," Agatha smiled – while letting Rio in. She stared at the box in her other hand. "What's in there?"</p><p>"Oh, a gift for Nicky!" Rio entered in, "I was hoping to give him this; I don't know if he likes to draw, but I got him colours and a small canvas. I was told that kids are very creative nowadays."</p><p>Agatha was impressed; it was true that Nicholas liked to draw, but she had never mentioned it to her — how was she able to guess?</p><p>"That's very kind of you," she took the box, and the bottle in her hands, "I think you'll have to wait; he is at a friend's house, he insisted to let him sleep there — and the mother of his friend was kind enough to tell me that she would've brought him at school, then at home," she saw a spark in Rio's eyes, "I couldn't say no; since, I still have to tell him about the whole moving out thing."</p><p>"He's not home, then?"</p><p>Agatha understood her tone of voice; she found her adorable, incredibly so.</p><p>"He isn't," she walked towards the table that was at the center of the room, leaving the items there, "I thought that it might've been nice for us to have a dinner; I prepared lasagna — I tried a new recipe, hope you're hungry."</p><p>Rio was <em>starving</em>, but not of lasagna; she looked at Agatha maliciously — but she also had to talk to her. So, she would've (unfortunately) left her desires aside. The plan was to convince her.</p><p>"Lasagna, huh?" Rio got closer, "I'd eat whatever you cook; never been picky."</p><p>Agatha pressed a kiss on her lips, and Rio could feel calmer; there was warmness and also a sense of worrying — Rio tried hard not to notice it.</p><p>"Sit down; I'll bring the food."</p><p>—</p><p>The dinner was pleasantly nice; Rio had tried to initiate the '<em>talk</em>' with her, many, many times — but Agatha always found a way to let it not emerge. They laughed and talked about everything, but that. Rio suspected that she was doing it on purpose.</p><p>"Do you want to watch a movie, Rio?"</p><p>Agatha stared at her, smiling widely; maybe the movie could've helped her?</p><p>"Sure, what do you have in mind?"</p><p>She stood up from the chair, grabbing Rio's arm and walking her towards the couch; she pushed her on it — and Agatha sat right next to her. The controller was in her hand, and her eyes firm on Rio.</p><p>Rio didn't understand; she hadn't drank that much wine — nor any other stuff. Why had she pushed her? She didn't mind it as she noticed playfulness in her actions.</p><p>"It's a movie that is famous these days; it's 'The Handmaiden', ever heard of it?"</p><p>Of course, Rio, being the <em>huge</em> lesbian that she was, had heard of it. She had watched that movie two or three times — it was rather spicy and full of tension. She wondered if Agatha knew about it or if she genuinely didn't. Either way, she couldn't let her know that she had watched it already.</p><p>"Never heard of it — might be a discovery."</p><p>Agatha prepared everything for the movie — set the volume up, increased the brightness, and rested her back on the couch.</p><p>The movie started; Rio immediately seemed engaged, and Agatha looked interested too. The plot was full of twists, beautiful and talented actresses, and amazing music.</p><p>Without even realising it — thirty minutes had passed, and Rio had almost forgotten the reason as to why she was there; to talk to Agatha.</p><p>As she was about to speak, Agatha had stopped the movie. Rio was confused. Was the movie not to her liking? She didn't know, but she could've asked it later. That was her opportunity.</p><p>"Agatha—"</p><p>"Rio," she preceeded her, "I see that you're enjoying the movie."</p><p>Rio stopped; it was useless to lie now. She did enjoy the movie and Agatha's company, but why was she asking it now?</p><p>"It's a nice one; good plot, actresses and—"</p><p>"Yes, I noticed that; you <em>barely</em> paid attention to me."</p><p>She wanted her to pay attention to her? Was Agatha being needy? Rio felt her heart beat faster, her lips curled in a smile; she didn't know that side of her, and adored to see how demanding she was.</p><p>"You always have my attention—"</p><p>"Rio—," Agatha had stopped her once more, "I feel bad — there's something that's been on my mind for entire days; and I can't seem to think of anything else, but it," her cheeks were coloured, "I think it's embarrassing to say, though."</p><p>Rio got closer to her. "I won't ever judge you, Agatha. Just tell me."</p><p>Maybe Agatha had been thinking of what Rio had said — of allowing Rio to go with her. Had she changed her mind?</p><p>Agatha breathed. "Remember when my mother walked in the office?"</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"You were about to unzip my pants," her eyes were firm on her, and Rio felt all of the memories getting back to her. "You were about to—," there was a tiny smile, "I know it's wrong to ask this, but, could you—"</p><p>Rio stood up from the couch; kneeling down, in between Agatha's thighs, her hands on the zip, once again. And she giggled, laughing even — her girlfriend needed her more than ever, who was her not to grant her request?</p><p>"You thought about it way too much; you could've told me you wanted to feel my tongue on you."</p><p>Agatha's hands went on Rio's hair. "There's more."</p><p>"More?"</p><p>"Remove my pants and you'll see."</p><p>She did as she was told; slowly, she unzipped them, her hands put the pants down, throwing it away, and Rio saw it — Agatha was wearing <em>lingerie</em>; she wore red panties, so well fabricated, with a little bow on the top of it.</p><p>Rio smiled, and even let out a laugh; her gaze went to Agatha — who seemed to be intrigued by her reaction, as if she expected it.</p><p>"Agatha, when did you even buy this?"</p><p>"Oh, I had time," she caressed her cheek. "Do you like it? I made sure to buy the same colour of my lipstick; since you like it so much."</p><p>"I can't even express properly how much I like it," her words were sincere, "I wonder; does this mean you also have a bra that matches the panties?"</p><p>"I'm wearing it."</p><p>Rio's eyes brightened, hunger increasing; she never felt more aroused, more hot than that moment — Agatha had really thought about everything, and it seemed that she had been thinking about it for a very, very long time.</p><p>"Can I see it?"</p><p>Agatha was avoidant. "I don't think you'd want to see me shirtless; let alone wearing only a bra."</p><p>"Agatha," she got up, sitting on her lap, legs divided as Agatha's hands went on her ass, "I think you really say these things to <em>anger</em> me; why would I, your girlfriend who is head over heels for you, not want to see you in sexy lingerie?"</p><p>"Because my body is different," her voice was calm, but her eyes couldn't hold the contact, "I–, ever since I gave birth to Nicholas, I never managed to get back in shape; I should've done that, but work and raising him, I didn't have the time. I have a few fat rolls, and stomach fat. I don't want to disgust you."</p><p>Rio bit her lip, searching for the right words to say; Agatha had always been insecure about her age, looks — that had always managed to infuriate Rio, who knew it was all wrong.</p><p>"My love, my sweet behalf," her tone was teasing, her hands on her cheeks. "You think I would care about those things? You don't seem to understand how,—" she stopped, was it the right time to say that word? "—How much I adore you, like you; Agatha, for every thing you hate about yourself, I'll love it <em>twice</em> as hard — until you'll be exhausted, and finally see you through my eyes; because all I see is you — my beautiful girlfriend."</p><p>Agatha felt her eyes getting watery; she never knew Rio had such a way with words, as if she knew what to say in every situation — she kissed her, hard yet soft.</p><p>"If you don't mind, help me unbutton the shirt."</p><p>Rio did that; every button she undone, she felt the desire increasing — until, there was no shirt anymore. Agatha's naked chest, and her red silky bra — Rio examined her whole body, from the hips, to her bosom.</p><p>"Fuck, Agatha," her lips went on her neck, kissing it slowly, "I think, one of these days, it's going to be hard for me to keep my thoughts at bay."</p><p>Agatha moaned; Rio's hand went inside her bra — touching her breast, fingers playing with her nipple. "You're so beautiful, Agatha," she whispered, "I've never seen anyone as beautiful as you, I'm so lucky to be able to see you."</p><p>Her face had never been that red — and Rio noticed it; compliments were always her forte, and she had to let Agatha know that she wasn't just saying stuff without a sense, but she meant every single word.</p><p>"Your body is beautiful," she was now facing her, only to kneel down (again), once more, between her thighs. She kissed her tummy and caressed her waist, "I wish to stare at it forever; your body tells me your story, what you've been through, and I'm never going to stop admiring it."</p><p>"Rio," Agatha's eyes were teary, a tear had managed to cross her cheek, her face was also of a deep red colour — worse than before. "Please, <em>be quiet</em> for a while; I think I'm about to pass out if you say any other compliment."</p><p>Rio smiled. "I told you; the things you hate about yourself, I'm going to love them twice as hard."</p><p>Agatha breathed in and out; she couldn't help but think of Rio as a lovely puppy — who had nothing but adoration for their owner. She laughed at that thought. She wouldn't have told her that — of course.</p><p>"If you're not in the mood for talking," her hands went to lower her panties, revealing Agatha's clit, "I'd say to skip to the physical part."</p><p>Rio's tongue was on her; she licked, sucked and kissed her clit, with such force and determination that scared her. Agatha felt pleasure hitting her — her moans were loud, and Rio was so, so fast.</p><p><em>Tomorrow</em> would've come; Rio would've talked to Agatha, and Agatha would've listened. But, for now, they could use some relax.</p>

<p>Morning soon came; Rio and Agatha were sleeping in the bed, cuddled to one another until the alarm went off — making Rio jump out of surprise.</p><p>Agatha woke up shortly after. She stared at her, who had never heard such a loud alarm in her whole life — she laughed, vividly so.</p><p>"Good morning, Rio," her eyes were almost shut, if not completely. "I get that you don't like my alarm?"</p><p>"Why is it so loud?!"</p><p>"Oh, that's because I'm a heavy sleeper. I need something <em>strong</em> to wake me up."</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow; Agatha had a smirk on her lips. Perhaps she knew that she'd react that way — there was a huge sigh, then Rio stood from the bed, letting go of her hopes of falling asleep once more.</p><p>"We have work, don't we? I'm going to make breakfast," she took Agatha's hand, attempting to lift her up, but, instead, she pulled Rio back in her bed — <em>giggling</em> and <em>hugging</em> the younger one.</p><p>"Agatha!"</p><p>"Come on, Rio," she teased. "I suppose you prefer working, instead of staying with me — sleeping, cuddling."</p><p>"You got it wrong; I just want to make you breakfast — you <em>always</em> cook for me, that's why."</p><p>Agatha felt weak as she knew that Rio was right — work attended her. But, this time, it would've been different, there was some news that she had to deliver her. So, she got up — stretching and looking back at Rio.</p><p>"Let's see what you're able to make."</p><p>—</p><p>Rio was not a brilliant cook; she had made pancakes — some were burnt, the others looked weird, and it was better to leave them untouched.</p><p>"I tried my best — I'm sorry, should we order something from a nearby café?"</p><p>"No, it's not that bad," Agatha ate one piece, she tried hard to swallow it — Rio was watching, and the last thing she wanted was to make her feel sad. "Are you not eating it?"</p><p>"And risk food poisoning? <em>Nah</em>."</p><p>Agatha glared at her — Rio smiled.</p><p>"I'd like to cook for you, until—"</p><p>"—<em>Until you move away</em>."</p><p>Rio saddened at the thought of it; she couldn't believe that days had passed, and sooner than later, Agatha would've be gone — and she still had to talk to her — <em>now</em>, it seemed like the right time.</p><p>"Agatha—," she pressured. "I have to talk to you."</p><p>"There's nothing to talk about," Agatha stood up, her eyes distant yet very present, "I think it's best for us to get ready. It'll be my last day, after all."</p><p>Rio got up too. "Last day? What do you mean?"</p><p>"<em>Today</em>; I'll sign a document that will leave the company in Wanda's hands. I told you, I would've quit being the CEO — I have to speed up the process, I have to search for a house, talk to Nicky tonight and—," she thought hard, "I have a few weeks to do that. My mother is away for two weeks — and, in that short time, I'll have to change phone number, country and assure Nicholas's safety, and find a school that will insert him in the second semester."</p><p>Agatha knew that she should've told her sooner, Rio's eyes were in pure shock — as she wasn't able to form a sentence.</p><p>"Let's go now."</p><p>She left the room; and Rio watched her go, still and with many things unsaid — she <em>still</em> had a chance, she knew it.</p><p>—</p><p>The news of Agatha Harkness resigning had spread like wildfire amongst the employees, and office — Jen hurried to ask Rio, but she quickly dismissed her; saying she truly didn't know, until that morning.</p><p>Agatha had given them a final speech; saying how she wished for them to work hard, achieving dreams they wanted to achieve, not let anything get in your way — and every time, she stared at Rio.</p><p>Wanda also spoke to them, proclaiming herself as the new CEO; there was a round of applause, and many thought of throwing her a party.</p><p>Then, Agatha gathered her stuff, looked behind, one more time, and hurried to leave. Rio felt useless now — in a workplace that, without Agatha, seemed useless and pointless.</p><p>Nevertheless, she worked hard — tonight, she would've talked to Agatha once more.</p><p>—</p><p>It was evening when Agatha had decided to call Lilia to help her talk to Nicholas. They all sat on the couch — Agatha tried to think of easy words and clear concepts, and she felt safer with Lilia by her side.</p><p>"Mama, why is Lilia here?"</p><p>Lilia smiled. "Nicholas, honey—, your mom has something she wants to share with you; and I'm helping her to say it to you."</p><p>Nicholas was worried. He immediately looked at Agatha. "What's happening, Mama?"</p><p>Lilia caressed Agatha's shoulder. It was her way of saying to go, to let it all out — she took a deep breath and decided to speak.</p><p>"Nicky," Agatha took his hand, "I, you, are going to another place — a country, <em>much</em> better than this one," his eyes widened, "I wanted to hear your thoughts about it; you'll start a new school, make new friends, and I'll always be there for you. Always."</p><p>Nicholas lowered his gaze. "Why are we going?"</p><p>That was the hardest part; Agatha glanced at Lilia — and that meant she wanted her to step in to help her.</p><p>"Nicholas," Lilia's voice was soft, caring, and understanding. How to explain it in simple words? That'll mean explaining the <em>horrors</em> of Evanora. "Your mother needs to go away from this town. She can't stay here any longer, and you must go with her. I promise you, and you know how my promises work, that you're going to be happy."</p><p>"I'm not sad about leaving my school friends — I want Mama to be happy!"</p><p>"Then, <em>go</em> with her."</p><p>Nicholas felt something amiss, someone, specifically. "And Rio? Is she going to come with us? She's Mama's friend!"</p><p>Agatha sighed. "No, she won't. She has her life here, but we'll also manage to make a new life for us."</p><p>The kid pouted, but he seemed to understand — maybe he didn't want to make his mother worry. He was also very sensitive.</p><p>"I never got to thank her for the gift."</p><p>"There's going to be a time for that," Agatha stood up, as her hand went to pat his head, "I will make sure of it, trust me."</p><p>"I trust you, Mama, and I also trust Lilia."</p><p>Agatha hugged him; she had to endure many hardships in her life, but with Nicholas there, she felt powerful and unstoppable — her kid was everything she ever needed.</p><p>After a while — Agatha had received a text, and it was from Rio. She had told her to meet up at the park, the same one of their first date; she said it was '<em>urgent</em>', and that will have taken a few minutes of her time.</p><p>She was anxious, and Lilia noticed a sudden shift in her behaviour.</p><p>"Lilia, I have to be away for thirty minutes; can you watch Nicky for me? I really have to go."</p><p>"Go, I will make him dinner for him, and you."</p><p>Agatha smiled; she quickly dressed up — hoping for Rio to be okay.</p><p>—</p><p>Her car had been parked badly, but she didn't care; She got outside and entered the park. Agatha walked towards the bench, she knew (instinctively) that Rio would've been there, and she was.</p><p>Though, something was weird. Rio was wearing elegant clothes: a white shirt and refined trousers — she held a bouquet of flowers. But why?</p><p>Agatha got closer. "Rio," she hurried to speak, glancing at the flowers she held so tightly, "I was worried sick; is something wrong? What are these flowers for?"</p><p>"Have you noticed something in these flowers?"</p><p>She arched her brow, and her eyes went on the flowers; it was a bouquet of roses, red ones but, at the center of it, there were <em>two white roses</em>, the whitest a rose could be.</p><p>"These two are white?" Agatha felt bad for poiting it out. Maybe Rio had got them accidentally. "Did you get them by mistake?"</p><p>She laughed. "<em>I didn't</em>. These two white roses are us."</p><p>"Us?" Agatha was confused. "I don't understand."</p><p>Rio stepped closer, she took a deep breath — making Agatha worry even more, she thought of the worst, and wasn't ready for it.</p><p>"Agatha," her voice was strong, "I've been a white rose for all my life; I never got along with other roses because they were too red, too different from me. I always felt different, and I always knew that I, as a white rose, couldn't have ever met another one, like me," her eyes met Agatha's, "I always thought I'd be the only white rose, in a world full of red ones; until I met you, <em>Agatha</em>."</p><p>"Rio—"</p><p>"Agatha," she continued, "I hated myself for being a white rose; I couldn't see the beauty, the perks of it, but, meeting you, who is a beautiful, different and a white rose — showed me that it doesn't suck so bad, because, thanks to you, I was able to realise my own potential."</p><p>Rio saw tears in Agatha's eyes, but she had to go on with her words. "You made me realise that I'm not alone, that being different isn't so bad," she tightened the hold, "I think only us white roses can appreciate each other's beauty. So, Agatha, please, let me come with you."</p><p>Agatha hugged Rio; her tears streamed down her face. They wet her shirt — but she didn't care, and she hugged her back, even if she struggled because the flowers were heavy.</p><p>They were united for minutes, and Rio started to worry. "Agatha?"</p><p>"Be quiet, you huge, <em>good–with–words</em> idiot."</p><p>That comment had made her laugh; so, another couple of minutes had passed — Agatha had returned to face Rio, she cupped her cheeks into her hands.</p><p>"Do you really want to? What about your friends, this town?"</p><p>"This town wasn't really mine to begin with," she giggled, "I also talked to my friends; they were supportive, don't worry."</p><p>Agatha brought her face closer to her; they kissed — soft, gentle, and awaited kiss, needed from them both. A while had passed, and Agatha interrupted the kiss.</p><p>"Why do you like me so much."</p><p>"I don't like you," Rio smiled, and for a second, she could've laughed at Agatha's facial expression. "<em>I love you</em>; it's different."</p><p>The older one was staring in a weird way; Rio thought of having said the wrong thing, maybe it was too soon?</p><p>"You don't have to say it back—"</p><p>"I love you too, Rio."</p><p>Rio's cheeks were rosy — she forced a smile, and her hands wanted to reach her, but the flowers would've fallen to the ground.</p><p>"Agatha—"</p><p>"I love you, Rio," Agatha's took the flowers and laid them on the bench; her hands went around Rio's collar of the shirt, pulling her closer. "<em>I love you</em>," she pressed a kiss on her lips, then stopped, "<em>I love you</em>," then, another kiss, only for her to stop, "I love—"</p><p>"Agatha!" Rio's hands went on her lips, blocking her; Agatha noticed how red her cheeks were, how dilated her eyes got. "I have to ask you to stop; I love your lips on me, but I think I really would pass out."</p><p>"That's for teasing me so much," she laughed and then hugged her, "I guess, I'll have to look for a house big enough to contain three people."</p><p>"I'll help you," Rio stood still, until, suddenly, a thought to overcome her. "But, Agatha — how are we going to explain it to Nicky?"</p><p>"Oh, you can come with me home — I was telling him everything; I'm sure he'll understand better with you."</p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p>"Yes — never been more sure in my whole life."</p><p>Rio smiled, taking the flowers back; then, they both walked towards the car — dinner time was approaching.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio felt awkward — Lilia was there, and she kept asking her questions, but she didn't mind; Nicholas was also near her, and he was more than happy.</p><p>Lilia had let Agatha know that dinner was ready but that she couldn't have stayed, as she had to hurry home. Agatha understood — she thanked her endlessly and walked her towards the door.</p><p>Now, Rio was nervous; they all sat on the chairs of the dinner table.</p><p>"Rio!" Nicholas smiled, "I wanted to thank you for your gift! I love drawing."</p><p>"No problem, kid — I'm glad you like it."</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. "Nicky, I know I told that Rio wasn't coming, but plans changed — and she'll come with us."</p><p>Nicholas beamed up; almost choking on his food. "Really? Is that true, Rio?"</p><p>"Yes, because," Rio looked at Agatha, searching for her approval — and she nodded at her, and that made her feel safer. "Your mom and I are uh—, dating?"</p><p>"Dating?"</p><p>"Yes, honey," Agatha interfered. "I love Rio, and we are happy with each other."</p><p>Rio couldn't help but feel flustered; Nicholas, on the other hand, seemed excited — more than the two of them.</p><p>"It's like <em>marrying</em> someone?"</p><p>Agatha smiled, Rio's cheeks took a deeper colour.</p><p>"Yes, something like that."</p><p>"I'm happy for you, Mama," he laughed, giggled, looking at Rio, "I'm also happy for you, Rio!"</p><p>After many laughs; they started to eat — feeling relaxed. Things had been said. Soon, everything would've been over.</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha had managed to make Nicholas sleep — even if he was so happy and couldn't contain the excitement. Somehow, it tore him out, and, once asleep, Agatha walked out of his room — reaching Rio, who was sitting on the couch.</p><p>She sat next to her, eyes gazing at hers. "Are you okay?"</p><p>Rio lightened up. "Of course, I was resting; I thought of waiting for you."</p><p>Agatha's head went on her shoulder, closing her eyes and allowing herself to relax — she had nothing to fear. Rio was with her.</p><p>"I could bring you in your room; it's not comfortable here."</p><p>"It's perfect here — you're here, let me rest for a while."</p><p>Rio caressed her arm, and that made Agatha hum in response — she loved the view, she loved her; but, after a while, she began snoring, and Rio was asking herself if to bring her to the bed, or letting her stay here.</p><p>"Agatha?"</p><p>No response, she laughed.</p><p>"I guess we'll sleep here."</p><p>She stood still — knowing that she wouldn't have gotten any rest; <em>she didn't mind</em>.</p>

<p>One week quickly went by — Rio was plotting of firing herself from the company, soon, she would've moved away; starting a new life, and the job that had helped her gain experience, and many memories, seemed pointless to have now.</p><p>So, it happened during a sunny, bright day.</p><p>Rio knocked on the door of the office — where Wanda was working; she had the permission to enter, and once inside, she walked towards the new CEO — who looked very calm, in control of the situation.</p><p>"Boss?" She didn't know how to address her. "I came here to talk—"</p><p>Wanda giggled. "Come on, you're the girlfriend of my closest friend — you can use my name, I don't mind it."</p><p>Rio smiled as she sat on the chair — in front of her.</p><p>"I have a hunch on what you're about to say," Wanda dropped the pen she was holding, her gaze meeting Rio's, "I guess, you want to say it; in an official way."</p><p>"Well," there was something fun about the whole situation, "I want you to fire me."</p><p>"Alright, sign these papers," Wanda took a bunch of folders, only to find the one she was looking for — handed it to Rio, along with the pen she was previously holding, "I need one firm."</p><p>"Wow, I thought you'd beg me to stay," teased her, "I think you surrendered easily."</p><p>The red–head rolled her eyes, appreciating the funny attitude. "Agatha would probably get mad at me, I'd rather not."</p><p>With a fast movement; the papers were signed — Rio couldn't help but feel a little sad, but that feeling would've disappeared soon, because, new things awaited her.</p><p>"Here," she handed them to Wanda, "I signed."</p><p>Wanda looked at the papers, smiling a little. "Take good care of her, okay?"</p><p>"I will," Rio reassured — she would've done that — and that was something to never doubt. Soon, there was another thing she wanted to say to Wanda. She gathered a little courage. "Did you know I'm friends with your son?"</p><p>"Oh, which one?"</p><p>'<em>Which one</em>'? Rio lept back on her seat; she didn't want to be rude — or appearing surprised — but she definitely was. Billy had never mentioned her that he had siblings, but Rio hadn't really asked.</p><p>"How—, how many sons do you have?"</p><p>"Just two," she laughed, "Billy and Tommy!"</p><p>"Billy, I'm friends with him."</p><p>Wanda curled her lips. "I see. He mentioned me something once — but he didn't go into detail, and I respected his privacy."</p><p>"You're a good mom."</p><p>"I know," she stood up from the chair, "I think someone's waiting for you outside."</p><p>And she was right; she had told Agatha to meet her outside of the building — she didn't want to make her wait any longer, they would've gone to lunch together.</p><p>"Right," she stared at her, "I can't thank you enough, Wanda."</p><p>"No, no, stop with <em>these</em> stuff; I cry easily."</p><p>Rio smiled — she walked outside of the room; staring one more time at her workplace. There were many feelings, but none of them were negative. Jen and Hela knew about Rio's decision, but they still waved at her, laughing and trying to be discrete. After glancing one more time at them — she walked towards the elevator.</p><p>—</p><p>As she imagined; Agatha was waiting outside — phone in her hands, scrolling through the screen. Rio ran towards her, laughing, excitement at its highest.</p><p>"Agatha," she stood in front of her, smiling widely, "I got fired today!"</p><p>The look on Agatha's face was of thousands of layers; shocked, anxious, and worried. She put the phone away, staring at her. "That's not something to be proud of."</p><p>"No, no, you got it all wrong!" Rio had realised her own words, "I asked to be fired; we'll move out soon — it'd be hard to work from distance."</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath. "Just be careful with your words; you seemed way too excited to get fired."</p><p>"I'm happy that we're both unemployed — it's like we <em>match</em>!"</p><p>Her hand went to her cheek, pinching it hard yet soft — Rio let out a laugh, as a smile grew further; Agatha knew it, and she adored messing around, but she still felt slightly bad.</p><p>"I'm positive that you have some money saved in your bank account? Since we'll find a new job — or start a new business," she sounded confident, as if she had already plans in her mind. She looked at Rio, "I actually wanted to discuss it during lunch."</p><p>"Of course I have some savings left," she sighed — it wasn't much, but she would've managed to do something about it. "Also, I've been meaning to ask; where are we going to move out?"</p><p>Agatha had a smirk on her lips as if she had been waiting for that question; Rio felt her heart skip a beat — she had seen her smile many, many times, but it always made her feel weak.</p><p>"You're asking this only now?"</p><p>"Well, yeah," Rio took her hand, "I don't really mind where we go; as long as we are together."</p><p>That had caught Agatha off guard; Rio was always like this — straightforward, with no filter on — she liked it. So, with a timid stare, she began to speak, even if it annoyed her — in a good way.</p><p>"Spain."</p><p>Rio jumped on her spot; she didn't understand if Agatha was joking or if she was really serious. But, judging from the way she looked at her, it must've been true.</p><p>"But, Agatha! Nicholas doesn't know the language—"</p><p>"He actually does," Agatha reassured her, "Nicholas has been studying spanish at school, and he begged me to take him to private lessons. I gave in, you know how he is."</p><p>She couldn't believe those words — a sudden happiness overcoming her; she imagined teaching him words, idioms, and many other things. Rio smiled.</p><p>"How about you? You don't know it."</p><p>"That isn't a problem," she stepped closer, positioning arms around Rio's neck, lips almost touching — they breathed at the same pace, "I already found a great teacher that'll help me."</p><p>Rio knew she was talking about her.</p><p>"You just want free lessons," she closed the distance between them — this kiss felt different, new, and full of hopes for the future. "You're lucky that I have some time to kill."</p><p>"And because you can't say 'no' to me."</p><p>Agatha laughed — Rio kissed once more, this time, more fiercely; the heat soon grew, and it became hard to contain.</p><p>"Hope you learn fast; I'm not going easy on you just because you're my girlfriend."</p><p>"Never wanted you to go easy on me."</p><p>She noticed an innuendo in her words; Rio wished to touch her further — her hand ventured to her thighs, and Agatha grabbed it, pushing it away.</p><p>"Rio, we're outside."</p><p>"Let's skip lunch; I'm not even that hungry."</p><p>It was adorable, that side of her — so needy, demanding, and incredibly desperate of Agatha; she thought it was cute, but a little unhealthy.</p><p>"Patience, my dear Rio. We have something to discuss."</p><p>Rio sighed. "Alright, let's hurry then."</p><p>They both began to walk towards a restaurant, and Agatha had made the reservation; Rio trusted her.</p><p>—</p><p>The chosen place was delicious; italian food — Rio began to appreciate the cooking, and Agatha seemed to have noticed it. After eating and talking a while, laughing and giggling, Agatha started her discourse.</p><p>"So, Rio," she had an enigmatic face, "I've been thinking of opening a little café; I studied and searched for a place, and found one. But," eyes were weak, "I wanted to hear your opinion on it — you know, I don't think you'd want to work in a café, again."</p><p>"It's true, I don't <em>particularly</em> like the idea."</p><p>Agatha was understanding; she would've hated seeing Rio doing something she'd despise. Her hand went to hold hers — squeezing it. "It's fine; we'll think of something else—"</p><p>"But," she continued, "I was thinking in big; we could open the café — open an Instagram page, where we could share our works. I'll get better at drawing hearts and do other stuff — we could ship worldwide? Maybe, even start our own brand."</p><p>Icy eyes stared hard at her; that idea didn't seem so bad — it could actually work, perfectly fine. She never thought of it, never ever crossed her mind.</p><p>"Do you think it'll work?"</p><p>"Agatha," there was a light in her eyes, "I majored in these stuff; I studied it perfectly — never thought I'd be using them in real life!"</p><p>She felt calmer — Agatha couldn't help but smile.</p><p>"I trust you, I can also give you a hand."</p><p>"Want me to teach you how to make coffee?"</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. "Maybe?"</p><p>"Oh, you," Rio teased, her voice mocking her, "I have to teach you spanish, and now how to make coffee? How are you going to repay me?"</p><p>"You know how," she smiled; Rio always knew what to say — but Agatha also knew how to match her. It was a game, a competition.</p><p>"Well, I've been in a bad place — <em>financially speaking</em> — would you mind giving me an advance payment?"</p><p>"Rio," her hand was under her chin, eyes playful yet challenging, "I never knew you could be so needy."</p><p>"And? We're in love; it's not wrong or prohibited."</p><p>Agatha hummed. "Patience."</p><p>Rio groaned; after a while, she got her act together — she stared at her, as she noticed something flowing in her mind.</p><p>"By the way, do you want to get a drink with me and my friends today?"</p><p>"I'd love to."</p><p>—</p><p>Evening came; Rio had texted Agatha to meet her at the nearby bar — Rio was the first to arrive, she had never been so punctual. And, soon, Agatha had also arrived.</p><p>Rio looked at her — she wore a skirt, the length wasn't short, reaching her knees, and stockings. She held her phone tight in her hands, gulping a chunk of saliva. <em>Stockings</em> had always been her weak point — seeing Agatha in those felt weird.</p><p>"Where's everyone?"</p><p>Agatha stood before her — Rio returned to reality.</p><p>"They'll arrive soon," her eyes were on the skirt; it wasn't that long, but not that short either, "<em>unfortunately</em>."</p><p>"What do you mean? You shouldn't speak that way of your friends."</p><p>"You're wearing stockings."</p><p>Agatha softly purred. "And? I can wear what I want."</p><p>"You can do that, I'm not telling you that," Rio felt shy. Why was she even saying these things? "I know you wore them to tease me; you've been acting pure — <em>like a saint</em> — all day."</p><p>"I never knew they'd be this effective."</p><p>Rio sighed. "Of course they are."</p><p>"Behave," Agatha took her hand — and Rio wanted to reply, to say something; but, her friends had arrived, and she couldn't have done that.</p><p>They all greeted Rio and Agatha — after a while, they started to walk inside.</p><p>—</p><p>The drinks were pleasant, but Rio constantly kept gazing over Agatha — especially her thighs — because, involuntary or not, Agatha kept lifting the skirt up; doing that while gazing at Rio, and Rio, in response, always managed to lower it. She didn't understand her. What was she up to? Why was she tormenting her?</p><p>After an hour of talking — Agatha had to get home, Rio offered her to stay together a little longer; Alice had told her to be home because she still had to pack her stuff, she nodded.</p><p>Once in the car, Agatha proposed to go to a place that she, so much, adored, Rio had agreed to that — the car started, and they took a road she didn't even know. Where was this place?</p><p>Rio felt something burning inside of her, and Agatha noticed that.</p><p>"Is something wrong, Rio?'</p><p>She looked at her. Something was definitely wrong, Agatha had led her on, teased her non–stop and made her feel weird — incredibly stressed.</p><p>"No, I—," soon, she realised that it might've been good to tell her, "I actually think there is," her voice was strong, "I noticed you've been acting weird; every time I try to touch, every time I want to, you know, you slip away. Is something wrong?"</p><p>"How does that make you feel?"</p><p>Rio pondered for a while. "It's hard to say."</p><p>"<em>Frustrated</em>?"</p><p>Her heart was beating, louder, and at a high speed — she did feel frustrated, annoyed, and irritated. But, could she say that?</p><p>"Sort of."</p><p>"Poor you."</p><p>Did Agatha even care?</p><p>"Did I do something to upset you?"</p><p>"Not at all," she replied, calmy, "I assure you; you didn't do anything."</p><p>The car stopped; Rio didn't even realise where they were — it was a forest, but not too deep into nature. It resembled a reserved area. There were no cars or people, and she looked outside; she could see the stars.</p><p>Agatha went out and gently opened Rio's passenger seat, and she had gotten out of the car; taking a few steps — admiring the celestial beings.</p><p>"Agatha, it's beautiful!"</p><p>The older woman sat on the car's hood, smiled, and gestured Rio to sit next to her, she did as told. They both looked at the stars — Rio felt eased up.</p><p>"I'm glad you like the view; I wanted to show it to you before moving."</p><p>"You did good!"</p><p>After a while — Agatha had lost herself in staring at the sky; things would've changed, and she knew it. Her eyes shined, the bluish colour highlighted itself.</p><p>"Do you like them?"</p><p>Agatha turned around — Rio wasn't gazing at the stars, but at her; a quick blush preceeded her, Rio smiled.</p><p>"I do, even though the best star is the one I'm looking at now."</p><p>The reply was quick to arrive — Agatha was speechless, as she sighed. "I give up."</p><p>"What? '<em>Give up</em>'?" Rio was even more confused than before; Agatha's behaviour was indecipherable, shifting from weird to sane. "I don't understand."</p><p>"I tried to teach you a lesson, but I wanted to get you at your limits; that's why I was stopping your every advance," Agatha laughed, and Rio felt incredulous, "I guess, I wanted to teach you to not tease me so much; but it <em>backfired</em> — because, no matter how much I stop you, you always manage to turn everything your way. And it's not fun when you're like that."</p><p>Rio positioned herself in front of Agatha's, her hands on her waist — pulling her closer. "I never expected you to be so kinky — you always suprise me, in the most positive ways."</p><p>"You don't even know the whole truth."</p><p>"What do you mean," she frowned, "I'm supposed to worry?"</p><p>Agatha smiled; she took Rio's hand and brought her to her skirt — under the skirt — and Rio was aroused, confused, and happy. The stockings were thin, almost invisible, and the material must've not been a good one. She felt something amiss — her fingers lingered in her between but couldn't quite understand what was wrong.</p><p>"Noticed anything?"</p><p>"Yeah, these <em>damn</em> socks are in the way."</p><p>A vivid laugh came from Agatha. "Anything else?"</p><p>Rio pondered; her fingers touched her clit, sliding down and, she had understood — the thing missing was her underwear — <em>Agatha's panties</em>.</p><p>"Agatha," she was nervous, angry even. "Are you not wearing underwear?"</p><p>"Perhaps."</p><p>Many were the emotions she was feeling — how could Agatha be so reckless? What if, by mistake, her friends had noticed that? No, that was too much — and the heat that Rio was feeling down there didn't help either.</p><p>"Are you insane? What if they — my friends — saw you?"</p><p>"Why would you friends want to watch under your girlfriend's skirt?"</p><p>She was right; but it was still a very odd thing to do — Agatha had never been that seductive, beautiful, and incredibly charming. Rio thought of a plan to get to her.</p><p>"I think you are the one who needs a lesson — not me."</p><p>"Of course, you're my spanish teacher; I thought you'd be the only one teaching me."</p><p>Agatha was having the time of her life — Rio panicked, as she couldn't take it anymore — she felt incredibly weak yet strong.</p><p>Her finger managed to break the fabrics of the stockings — it wasn't hard — they were just poorly made. And Agatha was wet, betraying the brattiness, and how she had flaunt herself before.</p><p>"Looks like you also couldn't resist any longer," two fingers quickly, without any warning, had entered inside her — Agatha gasped, only to laugh then, "I'm not sure on what to do; if making you beg — or cum endlessly."</p><p>"Come on — mine was just one little prank; yours is just evil," Agatha stared at Rio's eyes, and then at her lips, "I don't think you'd want that — you were so desperate to touch me, what happened to that?"</p><p>It was irritating how easily she could understand Rio's doubts — truth to be told, she wanted to let Agatha come more than anything; so, for that time, she would've put her whole revenge aside (for now).</p><p>"<em>You're so annoying</em>."</p><p>Rio got closer — pushing Agatha on the car; lips united, anger, stress, fusing into that one, rough kiss — lips almost swollen. Rio's fingers were fast, in and out, each time faster, Agatha grasped for air while still continuing the kiss.</p><p>There were many moans, laughs, and giggles; Rio couldn't believe that she was doing that in the <em>middle</em> of nature, and Agatha had never looked so beautiful.</p><p>The fingers slid in perfectly — and Rio could only hear Agatha's sounds.</p><p>"Harder," Agatha managed to say, out of breath — and Rio had satisfied her wish; the speed increased at an alarming rate, making the body of the older woman twitch in pleasure, too much to handle, but she knew she was close.</p><p>"More."</p><p>She stopped — a wicked smile grew on her lips; she was well aware of how close Agatha was, but the thought of revenge still hadn't left her mind.</p><p>"<em>Beg for it</em>."</p><p>Agatha whined; her eyes were teary, tears of pleasure — she tried to fight her — but her desires had the best on her; she would've begged.</p><p>"Please, Rio," she bit her lip, "I'm so close; I've never been this close — you're doing so good, my Rio."</p><p>"Still not convinced."</p><p>Rio laughed — Agatha felt hot, too warm and desperate for her touch; it was a bit humiliating, she had never known how captivating her touch could be.</p><p>"Please—"</p><p>"Do you feel sorry? For driving me insane — making me worry.'</p><p>"I do, I'm sorry," her breath was short, "I thought it'd be fun; I just wanted to tease you," lips kissed her, hungrily, "I want you to continue — only you can make me feel like this; desperate, hungry, at your mercy. Please, give me more. I know you can, my sweet Rio."</p><p>Rio had lost completely to her senses — if she wanted more, she would've given her. Her begging had been convincing (not that she had done much). With a hint of doubt, she had inserted a third finger in; and the moan of surprise from Agatha was just perfect.</p><p>Soon, very soon — Agatha had come; the neat and clear sound echoed through the woods. Rio removed her fingers from her — perhaps, it'd been too much to handle.</p><p>"I hope to not wet my skirt."</p><p>She would've done that; Rio came up with a plan.</p><p>"Stay still," Rio kneeled down, lifting the skirt — she truly was a mess — the liquid everywhere, but Rio would've taken care of that. She began licking the fluid, swallowing it — licking, and swallowing it again — in a goofy attempt of drying her. To Rio's surprise, Agatha only managed to come more, but Rio didn't mind — she would've drank it all.</p><p>After minutes of <em>that</em> — Rio thought that she was (almost) dry (she wasn't), so she got up — facing her — and Agatha's face was red, redder than other times.</p><p>"You drank all of my cum? All of it?"</p><p>"<em>All of it</em>."</p><p>Agatha laughed. "And I'm the kinky one."</p><p>The wet lips of Rio met hers — Agatha didn't mind it, she loved her.</p><p>"Agatha, don't pull one of your pranks — <em>ever</em> again."</p><p>"If the punishment is like that; I might."</p><p>Rio sighed, she hugged her — a moment of softness, after the wild action they had done. Agatha hugged back, feeling the stress of the younger one.</p><p>"Oh, Agatha, I'm so happy you're a weirdo like me."</p><p>"What was that, Rio?!"</p><p>Agatha sounded irritated — Rio tightened the hold; she loved her, more than she could ever have imagined.</p>

<p>Days flew, and, without any warning, the <em>day</em> of the departure had arrived — and Rio was in her room, packing the last things; she felt sad, but also happy, that room held many memories and emotions. But she knew that new things were about to come, she felt hopeful.</p><p>Alice wasn't home, probably at the café — they had said their goodbyes earlier, but Rio wanted to see her once more. She couldn't though, the café wouldn't have been there without her — she sighed.</p><p>With luggages in her hands, she began walking towards the kitchen; she left the keys of the apartment on the desk, smiling while doing so. Agatha had sent her a text, she was waiting for her, and so was Nicholas — she had insisted on picking her up.</p><p>The keys were on the table, she hurried to go outside. After she closed the door — there was an unexplained, fleeting feeling, as she couldn't wait to have a new life with Agatha.</p><p>Fastly enough, she walked outside of the building, Agatha was there — she got out of the car and helped Rio to put the bags in. Rio thanked her. She was lucky, and she knew it.</p><p>After adjusting some stuff, they entered the car, Nicholas greeted Rio, and she returned the greet. Agatha stared at her.</p><p>"Ready?"</p><p>Rio nodded. "Always."</p><p>—</p><p>They were at the airport; in a few hours, the plane that would've brought them to Spain would've arrived. She felt sad but couldn't let Agatha know.</p><p>"Is something wrong?" Agatha had managed to see through her — Nicholas was busy looking around to notice Rio's sadness.</p><p>"I'm just," she hesited, Agatha hold her hand, reassuring her that everything would've been fine, "I'm kinda sad that Alice, all of my friends, didn't come to say goodbye at the airport; I mean— we already said goodbye, but still."</p><p>Agatha laughed. "Are you sure?"</p><p>Rio was sure of it; Alice was busy at the cafe, Jen working, Hela too, and Billy studying. They wouldn't have made it.</p><p>It was sudden; Agatha pointed at a direction — Rio saw them, her friends running towards the duo, and she gasped in surprise. They were faster than ever.</p><p>"Rio!" They chanted — and they all hugged her, Rio felt embarrassed, but happy; a group hug. That's what she missed.</p><p>"But—, <em>how</em>? You all are busy!"</p><p>"We knew you would be sulking if we didn't show up," Hela said, laughing, "I didn't want Agatha to deal with it. So, she told us where and when you would have taken the plane."</p><p>Rio gazed quickly at Agatha, and she pretended that it wasn't her doing; she giggled and returned her gaze to her friends.</p><p>"And the café?"</p><p>"Oh, I hired new people; I seriously need you to stop worrying." Alice reassured.</p><p>Rio's look went on Jen and Hela. "And the work?"</p><p>"Ms. Maximoff told us to go, she gave us some free time," Jen stared at Agatha briefly, "she told us to say bye to you."</p><p>Agatha smiled.</p><p>"What about you, Billy?"</p><p>"I can skip a lesson or two; it's not that I haven't done it before," Billy gaze met the one of Agatha, "Ms. Harkness, don't tell my mom, <em>please</em>—"</p><p>Agatha found it extremely funny. "No worries, my lips are shut."</p><p>Rio's eyes were teary; she had never imagined to be so important for so many people — they had changed her, watching her grow and mature. She was glad to have them.</p><p>"Guys—, how can I even repay you?"</p><p>Alice stood closer, taking a step in. "By living your life, with someone you love," her hand took Rio's, Alice would've been the one that would've missed her the most, "I'm happy for you; I watched you go from an annoying, undisciplined brat, to a beautiful woman."</p><p>"Well, on the brat part, we still have some work to do," Agatha added — and everyone laughed, and Rio, too, found herself giggling.</p><p>"Thank you, Alice, everyone," Rio dried her eyes, "I promise — distance won't say anything. We can call and text every day."</p><p>Soon, there was an announcement — the plane would've arrived earlier, and they still had the check–in to do. Rio hugged them once more, and the friends of hers said goodbye to Agatha — and Nicholas (even if he didn't quite understand).</p><p>They began to walk; Rio gazed back one more time — everything would've been perfect.</p><p>—</p><p>The three of them embarked on the plane. Rio had taken the window seat; looking outside — it was a sunny day, and there wouldn't have been any turbulence (she hoped).</p><p>Nicholas was drawing something, and he stood between them — feeling a bit sleepy.</p><p>Agatha gazed over Rio. "Are you okay? You look a bit down."</p><p>"How could I be sad when I'm with the person I love."</p><p>The thin blush had managed to reach her cheeks; Agatha looked at her, trying to be calm (she wasn't). "Don't say such things — and tone down the flirting when with Nicholas."</p><p>Rio smiled. She knew Nicholas was too tired to even care about them — he had been woken up earlier than usual and needed time to realise that he was awake.</p><p>"You're mean, Agatha."</p><p>The older woman rolled her eyes; her gaze went to Nicholas, and he had fallen asleep. When, how, Agatha truly didn't know — but she did wake him up at an unspeakable hour. It was logical for him, but she didn't mind. He needed that sleep.</p><p>"I'm not," she continued, "I think you secretly enjoy it."</p><p>Rio gasped. "Agatha, how scandalous of you to say that!"</p><p>She smiled, even if she hated the idea of it — her eyes became soft, and that was all Rio's doing; she had become a new person, and the best had yet to come.</p><p>"Rio," her voice was almost too quiet, "I can't thank you enough for coming with me; I don't even entirely understand your decision."</p><p>"This again?" Rio giggled, "I did it because I wanted to," her hand went to hold hers, trying not to wake Nicholas up (she desperately didn't want to), "and I did that, because I couldn't stand not be with you."</p><p>Agatha laughed nervously. "Will you ever start loving me less?"</p><p>"That's just not possible."</p><p>Rio leaned in, bringing Agatha's hand on her lips; delivering a gentle kiss on her knuckles — making Agatha shift on her seat, a smile appearing on Rio. "You know it's not possible."</p><p>Agatha wished to wipe that smug off her face, but with Nicholas being between them, it simply wasn't possible — and Rio knew that and was using it to her benefit.</p><p>"Just wait until we land and get home," she retreated her hand, placing her knuckles, where Rio had kissed her, on her own lips; Rio laughed — and Agatha would've made her pay for it.</p><p>The plane was about to take off; Rio gazed one last time out of the window — she would've missed that place, but knew that she simply couldn't have been there forever; without a purpose, or a way to live. So, she smiled — her new life about to begin.</p>

<p>Time always played a huge role in Agatha's life; she had always felt as if time, the costant moving forward of life, the irony behind it, was a way for the universe to punish her; in an attempt of reminding her how fragile, important every hour, minute, second truly was. Her life had been a difficult one — but something had changed. </p><p>She, who had no purpose but moving forward — be there for her son (Nicholas) that was the only thing cheering her up — had now someone else that motivated her to not be scared of time: Rio.</p><p>Years passed since the '<em>escape</em>' from their hometown — five, to be precise. Agatha and Rio (along with Nicholas) had managed to create something new from nothing; it was admirable, mad even, but that was their reality.</p><p>They had opened a café; it was hard at first, but soon, their popularity hit its highest — they started from selling coffees to making their brand, shipping worldwide. The business they had started had managed to catch the hearts of many, mostly due to Agatha and Rio, who were known as the 'cutest couple that made coffees' — their Instagram page had many followers, many requests and many were mesmerised by how funny, yet serious they were.</p><p>Things were going well also for Nicholas — he had grown, and was now a teenager attending high–school; his grades were good, and had now a perfect usage of the new language — Rio suspected him having a crush.</p><p>So, that day, it was their fifth anniversary; Rio and Agatha had invited their friends to visit them — and they had agreed. It would've been during lunch, Agatha was sitting on the couch, and Rio (surprisingly) was making lunch. Soon, she had left the kitchen and went to sit next to Agatha, making the older woman lift her gaze from the phone.</p><p>"How's the cooking going?" Agatha asked, a tender smile on her lips; she knew Rio was trying hard and also wanted to help her, but she made sure she wouldn't have had any access to the kitchen.</p><p>"Everything's fine — did you know that making pizza is actually fun? What if we tried to make them at the café—"</p><p>Agatha shushed her, and Rio didn't understand.</p><p>"No work–related stuff during our anniversary."</p><p>Rio giggled. "I'm sorry, I got excited. But, you have to admit, it's actually a great idea."</p><p>The older woman adored that side of the younger one; creative, witty, and with a sprinkle of innovation — they would've discussed it later, she was sure of it.</p><p>"Are you happy that our friends are coming?" Agatha asked; she knew that Rio was happy, but hearing it from her was what made her the happiest — how she would light up the mood.</p><p>"Very," Rio got closer to her, positioning her hand on Agatha's thigh, drawing little circles on it — Agatha flinched at that movement, "I also can't wait for our anniversary dinner, I'm already thinking of what Nicholas will get us this year!"</p><p>Agatha leaned in. "What do you expect?"</p><p>"A one–week vacation to a tropical paradise?"</p><p>"I don't think a 15–year–old has that kind of money."</p><p>Rio's laugh came soon; realising that Agatha was right — but dreaming had always been her best quality, so why not dream big?</p><p>"You're right. It's getting harder to read what he's thinking, more moody; I guess teenagers these days are way more emotional."</p><p>It was true — Nicholas wasn't a kid anymore, and Agatha couldn't help but miss it a little, even if she wouldn't have admitted it.</p><p>"How were you as a teenager, Rio?"</p><p>Her brown eyes lightened up; memories returning to her — from funny ones to embarrassing ones, but Agatha seemed interested in it.</p><p>"Oh, I was a mess," Rio smirked, "I was the best at school; good grades, and all. But, deep down, I was also a very <em>horny</em> teen — you know, that age."</p><p>Agatha was intrigued. "Really?"</p><p>"Yes," she laughed, perhaps remembering funny anecdotes, "I even used my allowance to buy explicit magazines — and oh, when my mom walked on me reading one of them. I had to blame my father; the poor man had the scolding of his life."</p><p>Agatha laughed, louder than expected, and Rio adored seeing her like this — free, beautiful, and herself; she was lucky and knew that from the beginning.</p><p>"Rio, my bad boy — since day one."</p><p>Rio got closer to her; lips met hers — sharing a kiss. After all of those years, it felt as if they were kissing for the very first time; the feelings were the same and had only grown stronger. Rio pushed Agatha on the couch, she positioned herself over her — the kiss continued, while Rio's hands unbuttoned Agatha's shirt.</p><p>Soon — Agatha heard intercom ring when Rio obviously didn't. So, with a small push, she made her stand up, and she quickly fixed her shirt, hair, and hoped for her cheeks to be normal; Rio, on the other hand, didn't understand.</p><p>"What's going on? Why did you—"</p><p>"The intercom rang; they arrived."</p><p>Rio pouted. "They can wait."</p><p>Agatha pinched her cheek; she was sulking, and it was fun to see — letting out a smile sigh. "You know that it's not possible."</p><p>And she was right. Rio walked towards the intercom, opening the main entrance; she waited at the front door, looking gloomy, her mood under her feet, and Agatha had reached her.</p><p>Agatha hugged Rio from behind; her lips near her ear — whispering. "Cheer up, we'll finish what we started later."</p><p>Rio immediately brightened up; the bell rang, and she went to open it — their friends all greeted them; Jen, Alice, Hela and Wanda (Billy couldn't come due to the final semester approaching, Rio didn't mind).</p><p>After an exchange of small talks; Rio welcomed them in the house — and they both gave them a small tour of the house. The apartment they had taken was small, but somehow big — there was enough space for everyone. They were all impressed. After the tour ended, Rio had proposed to go in the living room for a catching up — so they did.</p><p>Rio and Agatha knew what was happening in the lives of their friends; but talking about it, with a fine glass of wine before lunch, was something fun to do.</p><p>"So, how's everyone?" Rio asked; sitting next to Agatha on the couch — the others sat on the other couch, and on the armchairs.</p><p>"Well," Jen started, smiling widely, "I've been promoted at work; Wanda kindly offered me to work by her side," she stared at Wanda, and she was telling her '<em>go on</em>', "I never thought work could be so hard — especially as a superior. You really see the worst in people."</p><p>"Yeah, work's life great," Rio grinned, "Jen, how's the love life going, though?"</p><p>"Rio, do you enjoy seeing me suffering?! I swear, I'll beat you up, even if your girlfriend is here!"</p><p>Alice coughed. "I signed a contract; the café will expand, and it'll have new areas — including a karaoke one, a bookshop, and a place for meetings."</p><p>Rio gasped. "That's amazing! You always wanted that," she clapped her hands, and Alice felt embarrassed, "I'm so proud of you! My beautiful and smart Alice!"</p><p>"Now, now," Alice laughed nervously.</p><p>"What about me, Rio?" Jen tried not to sound hurt; but she was — and Rio ignored her, eyes meeting with Hela, who was enjoying the show, secretly wishing to add more mischief.</p><p>Agatha and Wanda stared at each other; they were attentively listening — and trying not to laugh, but they wouldn't have interrupted the little act.</p><p>"Hela," Rio's voice was curious; Hela had been acting suspicious, and she would've known why — via text, she had always been weird, and Rio couldn't well understand what was going on in her mind.</p><p>"Rio."</p><p>"So, how's life treating you?"</p><p>Hela laughed; her back resting on the armchair. "I fired myself from the company; now, I'm starting my own company."</p><p>Agatha locked eyes with Wanda; she knew Hela was one of the best employees and didn't understand her decision — but maybe, that wasn't Wanda's doing.</p><p>"What? When did you—"</p><p>"Three months ago?" Hela tried to remember, but her gaze said it all; she didn't care. "I couldn't be the only one without a life update. I didn't tell you sooner because it was supposed to be a surprise."</p><p>"I hope everything goes well, Hela," Agatha stepped in, "I hope you won't feel embarrassed to ask for opinions; to me, Rio or even Wanda."</p><p>"No, no," Hela reassured, "I'll be alright. I can't ask for help to you — who were my ex bosses; it'll be humiliating."</p><p>Rio protested, but Hela seemed to have already made up her mind — she wished the best of luck to her.</p><p>"What about you, Wanda? How's— you know, the company, my mo—," Agatha couldn't bring herself to finish the sentence; Rio's eyes were on her, and she felt a weird sense of guilt.</p><p>"Agatha," Wanda smiled, "I'll tell you about it later — alone. Okay?"</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio, receiving an understanding nod from her. After another round of small talks, discussing about Agatha's and Rio's café, and business, they had realised that they were thristy; so, Rio walked towards the kitchen and — to her surprise — the wine wasn't there.</p><p>"Wine is over," Rio told everyone; and they had told her that it was fine, but Rio insisted in going to buy a bottle — it would've taken her a few instants — they agreed.</p><p>Rio kissed Agatha's hand, then looked at everyone (especially Hela). "Don't be weird; I'll be gone for a couple of minutes — that goes specifically to you, Hela," Rio stared at Agatha, and let go of her hand, "I'll be back, my love."</p><p>Agatha tried hard to fight the blush appearing on her cheeks; she reassured Rio that nothing would've happened. Rio insisted, and Agatha had told her to go.</p><p>"Rio, just go. Jeez, I hate you," Jen snapped; Rio hurried to leave, laughing — without Rio, the atmosphere was weird, out of ordinary.</p><p>Hela was smiling; she looked at Agatha — eyes sparkling, "Agatha, so, have you already thought of stepping things further?"</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Oh, come on — don't play dumb; <em>marriage</em>."</p><p>Agatha shut her lips; her eyes were distant, and an alarming doubt reached her mind. She tried to look fine — obviously wasn't, and hated the idea of appearing like that; the question itself wasn't bad, and she knew something like that would've come. Eventually.</p><p>"Hela," Alice was quick, her serious gaze meeting Hela's funny one. "It's not your place to say such things; mind your own business."</p><p>Wanda stood up — sitting next to her friend, her hand went over her shoulder. "It's okay, Agatha. You don't have to answer."</p><p>"Yeah," Jen said, "Hela is noisy; she doesn't realise it."</p><p>Hela sighed. "I'm sorry, Agatha. I didn't mean upsetting you."</p><p>"You shouldn't be sorry," Agatha managed to speak, "I've been thinking about it — longer than I'd like to admit, I even brought the ring, it's hidden in our room; but, I'm scared."</p><p>Wanda leaned closer. "Of what, Agatha?"</p><p>"What if she says no?"</p><p>They all looked at each other, perplexed. How could Agatha say that? Rio, not accepting her proposal? Were they talking about the same Rio? But Wanda smiled tenderly; she wouldn't have judged her.</p><p>"Why do you say so?"</p><p>Agatha bit her lips, her hands sweating. "I don't think I'd make a good wife," her gaze lifted, "I still deal with the consequences of my mother's years of abuse; it still reaches me to this day. And, I'm going to therapy for it — but, there's so much stuff I went through; some days are hard, others are not, Rio didn't ever leave me alone during those time; she never gave up on me."</p><p>Alice got closer to her. "Do you think that, by marrying you, you're forcing her to deal with your problems forever?"</p><p>"Yes," she was nervous and surprised at how Alice had understood immediately, "I fear that she doesn't deserve someone like me — full stuff I can't control, unresolved traumas."</p><p>Hela was angry. She couldn't stand her obliviousness. "Agatha, what are you even saying — do you really think Rio will stop loving you for your problems? She's so in love with you, obsessed with you. It's even <em>unbearable</em> to watch."</p><p>Her anxieties always had been hard to tame, to keep quiet — rationally, she knew that Rio was madly in love with her, but she couldn't help it — the voices in her head were loud, and not easy to ignore.</p><p>"I know she loves me a lot," she paused, gathering enough words, "I just don't want her to waste her time with an insane person—"</p><p>"Agatha!" Wanda had raised her voice. It had never happened before; not even in the office, and that scared all of them. "What are you even saying? '<em>Insane person</em>'? You're not insane, crazy or mad. What you went through was horrible, and no one deserves it, but you shouldn't speak that way of yourself!"</p><p>"She's right, Agatha," Jen continued, "I don't know the details, but you're working on it with therapy, right? That's a great thing; it takes courage to do that — you've made progress, and an insane person wouldn't even realise they need help."</p><p>"Agatha," Alice was now speaking, "Rio loves every side of you, and she doesn't see you as a bad person, as someone mad; she sees you as human — <em>always has</em>, and won't ever judge you."</p><p>Agatha sighed; she knew that they were right. "I'll think about it."</p><p>Wanda patted her shoulder; and the others smiled widely — it was by then that Rio had returned home, holding two bottles of wine, a smirk on her face.</p><p>"I'm back," Rio walked towards them, "I hope you didn't do anything weird," she looked at Agatha, and she tried hard to look fine, but she didn't buy it. "What's going on? What's that look?"</p><p>"It's nothing; Agatha got emotional about your anniversary," Hela quickly answered, and Agatha was glad to her. Rio blinked twice, thrice — deciding if to believe her or not.</p><p>"I get it, I cried two times this day while remembering that we've been together for five years," she positioned the bottles on the coffee table — she stared at Agatha, who had a funny look in her eyes; embarrassed, happy? Rio couldn't tell.</p><p>"Uh—, why are there two bottles?" Jen asked; ready to make fun of Rio's mistake.</p><p>"One's for us," Rio explained, "I took the other one for Agatha; it's her favourite wine — anything to make my girlfriend happy!"</p><p>Agatha found herself without words; she felt the eyes of her friends on her, as if they were saying: '<em>I told you so</em>'. Couldn't even help but feel shy — a rosy colour on her cheeks.</p><p>"Go get the corkscrew," Agatha managed to say; she was shy, even if she didn't want to.</p><p>"Aren't you going to praise me for how good I did?"</p><p>"No. The corkscrew."</p><p>Rio laughed as she started walking towards the kitchen, humming a melody.</p><p>"We told you," Wanda whispered, "Rio won't say no — trust us."</p><p>Agatha nodded; perhaps they were right. And, if a rejection had been the answer, she would've dealt with it — she couldn't hide it anymore, not after so long.</p><p>—</p><p>They had spent a lovely lunch; full of stories, laughs, and moments of seriousness (at times). Time passed quickly — soon, the afternoon came, and their friends had to return to their hotel. But, before saying goodbye, Agatha had brought Wanda to the balcony of their house — she had to talk to her alone.</p><p>"Wanda."</p><p>"I know what you're about to say," she preceeded her, "I'm sure you'll ask about your mother, and how's the company."</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>"The company's going well; I'm sure it's still the most influent company of times — as for your mother," her eyes met hers, "I'm not telling you."</p><p>"What? Wanda, I'm asking you."</p><p>There was a sympathetic smile on her lips, Wanda went to take her hands — squeezing it tight. "Agatha. I don't think knowing her whereabouts will benefit you; you're in therapy and shouldn't worry about her — not anymore. Just live your life. I'll handle the rest."</p><p>"I just—," she sighed, "I left without saying anything, I changed number — I did everything to be away from her. But now," words were heavy, "I don't know."</p><p>Wanda was hesitant. "She's okay. But, I won't tell you more; it's for your own good."</p><p>"I see."</p><p>Agatha smiled, at least tried to; she then glanced at Rio through the window, she was talking, smiling with her friends — and Agatha wondered what they were discussing.</p><p>"You love her a lot," Wanda stared at Rio, "I'm happy for you, I hope you'll think about what we've been discussing."</p><p>"Yes," she felt her heart beating faster, "I hope so."</p><p>—</p><p>Once Agatha and Wanda had entered inside; they had taken their stuff, heading towards the door — Rio stared at her friends, and at Wanda — they were really saying goodbye.</p><p>"We should do that more often!" Rio said, with such excitement.</p><p>"You've become so boring; you quit smoking, drink wine — how do you even unwind?" Hela teased, receiving a slight punch from Jen.</p><p>"Oh, whenever I'm stressed, I just have sex with—"</p><p>Agatha pinched her cheek, so hard that made Rio let out a cry; sometimes, she overshared so much — her face was red, and she tried not to show it.</p><p>"Rio. <em>Shut up</em>."</p><p>"My girlfriend is so hot when she's mad!"</p><p>They were all looking at each other; worried, concerned, and even weirded out — but they were like that, always, so they shared an awkward smile.</p><p>After that — they went away; Agatha and Rio were alone. Agatha walked back on the couch, sitting on it — many thoughts flowed in her mind, her friend's words, and encouragement. Could she really have told Rio? Maybe she was exaggerating, and nothing bad would've happened.</p><p>Rio sat next to her, eyes sparkling. "So, we have this unfinished business—"</p><p>Agatha laughed. "You seriously didn't think about wooing me when our friends were right here?"</p><p>"Well, one tries their best—"</p><p>Agatha leaned in, her hands around Rio's neck — gently squeezing her, and the younger one giggled in response; she knew that game, a playful one.</p><p>"You're <em>such</em> a brat, Rio."</p><p>Rio couldn't resist — she kissed her, with such fierce force, her hands, slowly, unbuttoning the shirt; Agatha stopped her and looked at her.</p><p>"Nicholas will be home soon—"</p><p>"Oh, I know. But, what are the chances of him being at home now?"</p><p>The kiss continued. Rio's hands were ready to remove her clothes, but, soon, a sound of opening door; Agatha pushed Rio away — as she quickly re–composed herself, fixing the shirt, everything.</p><p>"Oh God, not this again!" Nicholas entered the house — looking at Rio, he rolled his eyes and sighed; that was embarrassing, for Agatha.</p><p>"Nicky, you and your mom—, we were, uh, <em>playing a game</em>!"</p><p>"I'm not a kid. I know what you were doing!"</p><p>Agatha stood up; her face painted in red, and an awkward smile on the lips — she got closer to Nicholas, and the boy tried to calm himself down — it wasn't the first time he had caught them, and nothing would've been more traumatising than the first.</p><p>"How was school, Nicky?"</p><p>Nicholas smiled. "It was alright! I managed to get a good score on the test — and uh, I got something for you," he put the backpack on the ground, searching for something — and he pulled out a small box, handing it to Agatha, while looking at Rio too, "I got this for your anniversary!"</p><p>Agatha's eyes widened, and Rio walked towards them. "Can I open it?"</p><p>"You have to!" Nicholas encouraged her, and Rio was as eager as Agatha — so, she started unpacking it.</p><p>Once open — there was an album, a photo album; Agatha stared at it, Rio smiled widely.</p><p>"It's, uh, so, it's been five years," he felt shy and afraid, "I think it's a big, big number! I managed to gather all of your photos together; trips together, during holiday, and, I'm in some too—," his eyes met Agatha's, and Rio's, they were watery, "I think it'd be nice to see through your memories, and what you've achieved together! So, yeah."</p><p>Agatha opened the book; Nicholas had put all of their photos — even the blurred ones that he had taken when he was little, and she couldn't help but tear up — as well as Rio. There were many pages, and they scrolled them all, almost on the last page — there was a missing spot.</p><p>"Nicholas, I'm—, this is beautiful!" Rio said, as she tried hard not to sob, but, eventually, she would've done that.</p><p>"Poor me that had to see all the photos of you being <em>lovey–dovey</em>."</p><p>Agatha rushed to hug Nicholas; the hug was soft, and tears streamed down her face — she delivered a kiss on his cheek, and caressed it after — the boy laughed, and it was comforting the the two.</p><p>Nicholas broke the hug, staring at her. "Mom, aren't you going to ask why there's a spot on the last page?"</p><p>"Oh, I thought—, I thought you made a mistake?"</p><p>"No mistakes," he smiled, widely and proud, "I think that there's an even more important picture that has yet to be taken, of a special and <em>important</em> day—!"</p><p>Agatha had understood — and that was the confirmation she needed; the book was closed and was now put on the little desk next to them. There was a smile on her lips — she stared at Rio, and she looked nervous and blushing massively.</p><p>"Uh, Rio—"</p><p>"Anyway, I have a project to do with some of my classmates — I'll be back by 8 PM. I'll try to get it over as soon as possible."</p><p>Nicholas took the backpack again — he winked at his mom and smiled at Rio; then, he walked away — Agatha and Rio were alone, once again, and for some hours.</p><p>"Rio—, can we talk?"</p><p>"I think he was teasing!" Rio immediately turned around, eyes meeting hers, sweating endlessly, "I mean! He always does! What was he even talking about?!"</p><p>Agatha was worried. "Marriage, obviously."</p><p>"Right! Marriage," she laughed hysterically so, "I mean—, why would you want to marry me—? Oh, that's so—"</p><p>But Agatha was serious, and Rio couldn't stop shaking — so Agatha took her hands, squeezing them tightly with a timid smile.</p><p>"Why wouldn't I want to marry you, Rio?"</p><p>Rio's heart beat fast, blood pressure skyrocketing. "Because I don't know—, you're so amazing, and all the shit you've been through was, well, a lot. And I don't think I'm enough for you?"</p><p>Agatha's hand were on her cheeks, caressing them gently and softly — and Rio never, ever, looked away from her eyes.</p><p>"Rio, what are you even saying? I couldn't ask for a better girlfriend—, you've supported me, and moved away with me, and you still do a lot for me, for Nicholas, you're more than enough, and I couldn't be more happy — you make me feel so loved, and appreciated," she noticed the tears that were about to appear in her eyes, "I love you, and I love you so much."</p><p>Shy tears streamed down, and Agatha kissed them away — the salty water meeting her lips, flying away, as Rio calmed herself down.</p><p>"I love you, Agatha," Rio smiled, and the other woman felt weak — then, she distanced herself from her and rushed to another room — after a while, she returned and there was a little box, Agatha immediately realised, ans laughed a little.</p><p>"Is it that obvious what I'm about to ask?" Rio's cheeks were burnt — Agatha continued to laugh, "I mean, to make you laugh like that."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes — she, too, went to the room where her ring was; once taken it, she returned to Rio — smiling and feeling embarrassed.</p><p>Rio, now, was shocked. "Don't tell me we had the same idea!"</p><p>"It seems so," she giggled, "I'm the one kneeling down."</p><p>"What? No, you won't, I'm the one!"</p><p>"Rio, no."</p><p>Rio kneeled down, with a movement so fast that Agatha hadn't realised it — and it scared her; Rio smiled, hands trembled, the little box was opened — revealing a ring, with a tiny amethyst in the center, purple, like her favourite colour.</p><p>"Agatha, would you—," Agatha snatched the box from Rio's hands and laughed while doing so — what was she planning?</p><p>"Stand up, I told you I'd be the one."</p><p>Rio stood up and proceeded to get the box back, but Agatha was slippery — and they smiled, giggled.</p><p>"Agatha, give it back! I swear to—"</p><p>But she didn't listen and ran towards their bedroom; Rio sighed and smiled — she ran towards the room, once there, Agatha sat on the bed, Rio got closer, the box was in one hand, and the other box in her other one.</p><p>Rio purred, walking towards her. "Where are you getting at with this game of yours?"</p><p>"Sit down, next to me."</p><p>And she did that — rapidly.</p><p>"So, are you thinking of some kinky fight? Until one of us surrenders? You know, this idea doesn't seem so bad—"</p><p>Agatha handed the box to Rio, and she was confused — <em>aroused</em> even.</p><p>"We are both sat, no kneeling down — we can both propose now," her lips curled in a smile, and Rio tried hard to refrain herself. "Happy?"</p><p>"I liked the kinky fight more."</p><p>Agatha pinched her cheeks, Rio smiled; she opened her box, and the ring was beautiful — a shiny emerald all around the ring, and it shined like gold.</p><p>"Rio—"</p><p>"No! I have to be the first—!"</p><p>"Shut up."</p><p>She went mute — now, Agatha could re–try.</p><p>"Rio, would you like to be my wife?"</p><p>Rio opened her box — again — and smiled, eyes still on Agatha. "Only if you agree to be mine."</p><p>Agatha leaned in, lips touching — sealing the promise with a kiss, and Rio gasped; the kiss was intense yet gentle, caring yet harsh, and they felt a tension that had never been there before (or maybe was). They put the boxes on the drawer, and stared at each other, only to continue kissing.</p><p>"Pre–marriage sex?" Rio whispered, making Agatha laugh through the kiss — her hand unbuttoning the shirt; <em>finally</em> doing that.</p><p>"Yes, of course. Is that even a question?"</p><p>Rio pushed Agatha on the bed, staring lovingly.</p><p>"But, Agatha, it's a sin to have sex before marriage," she whined and got closer to her, "I don't want to go to hell."</p><p>"Why did you propose it, then?"</p><p>The clothes were out of the way, and so were Rio's — her lips kissed her body, all over, and over again, Agatha slightly flinched.</p><p>"Because, <em>Hell</em> or <em>Heaven</em> — I don't care, as long as I'm with you."</p><p>Agatha couldn't help but blush. "Cheesy much?"</p><p>"Always."</p><p>And they laughed.</p><p>Time always scared Agatha; because she feared that it was never enough, and that she wouldn't have had enough time — until Rio arrived — and, now, she didn't fear it as much as she usually did — because, time spent with Rio seemed like a dream, and together, it didn't look so scary.</p><p>Knowing that she was happy — after what she had gone through, after many hardships, and times when she just wanted to give up, seemed now a distant memory; now, she wanted to live, to watch the time flow — forever.</p>
