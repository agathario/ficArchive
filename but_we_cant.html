<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>“Why are you so desperate to get under my skin?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged nonchalantly even though her heart was pounding. “You’ve lived comfortably enough in that palace of yours. I’d like to bring you back to reality.”</p><p>Rio-Sofia scoffed.</p><p>Agatha flinched when the door jolted. Rio-Sofia had smacked her hand against the door by her head.</p><p>“Again, you don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>OR: After second in line to the Spanish thrown, Princess Rio-Sofia Vidal was photographed kissing a woman, scandalising the Spanish royal family. Queen Isabella IV sends her daughter to university in London to keep her out of the public eye. This is where she meets Agatha Harkness, and no, they don't get off on the right foot.</p></blockquote>

<strong>Three months prior.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Evanora slammed the newspaper down on the dining table. Agatha, who was midway through a spoonful of Cheerios, raised an eyebrow.<br/>
</p><p>“Read it,” her mother ordered.<br/>
</p><p>She glanced down at the paper; it was the fucking <em>Daily Mail<em>. Yeah, no. Agatha wouldn’t read that shit with a gun to her head. The Daily Mail was written by a bunch of racist, homophobic, egotistical narcissists.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>No wonder it was her mother’s favourite newspaper.<br/>
</p><p>“You couldn’t pay me to read that.”<br/>
</p><p>Bold. Very bold. Her mother had lashed out at her for saying far less. Today, she didn’t care. She was hungover and had an eight-hour shift at their local café to mentally prepare for.<br/>
</p><p>Evanora glared at her as if weighing her options. When she abruptly jerked forward, Agatha braced herself for the smack she might receive. Instead, her mother snatched up the newspaper and cleared her throat.<br/>
</p><p>“Spanish princess almost sends the queen to an early grave,” Evanora recited the headline.<br/>
</p><p>And Agatha was supposed to care about this because…?<br/>
</p><p>Her mother continued, “Second in line to the throne, Princess Rio-Sofia was caught kissing a <em>girl,<em>” her mother emphasised the word as if it were cursed. “On the royals family holiday to Greece. A few hours later, Queen Isabella was photographed being rushed to the hospital.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>Why is she telling me this?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha barely paid attention to her own royal family, let alone the Spanish one. Why was some princess kissing a girl so fascinating to her mother? Her mother was homophobic, this was nothing new.<br/>
</p><p>“Can you imagine the shame?” Evanora shook her head. “The poor queen, to have her own daughter disgrace their prestigious family name. That girl must be a follower of the devil.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha <em>wished<em> she could say, ‘I guess I’ve disgraced our family name too…you know…because I’m a lesbian!' But she kept her mouth shut.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Mother, I really should be getting to work now, so I’m going to-”<br/>
</p><p>“Sit. Down.” Evanora cut her off as Agatha was getting up from her seat.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha lowered herself back into her chair.<br/>
</p><p>Three months. Three months and she’d be out of their stupid little village in Hertfordshire and in the country’s capital, London, to start her first term at King's College London (KCL). It wasn’t nearly as far away from her mother as she’d like to be, but it was a miracle Evanora was letting her go in the first place. She’d been able to attend university on two conditions:<br/>
</p><p>One: she had to be a volunteer at their local church for two years without complaining.<br/>
</p><p>Two: she had to get a job.<br/>
</p><p>Evanora made it clear that she would not be providing any financial support to Agatha whilst she was studying. If she wanted to <em>waste her life,<em> as her mother put it, getting a degree and becoming a lawyer instead of dedicating her life to god, she was on her own.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Her mother started muttering to herself as she scanned the newspaper.<br/>
</p><p>“Hm, perhaps you should watch it instead. Hand over your phone,” Evanora demanded.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha suppressed the urge to groan. She was going to be late for work, her mother didn’t know the first thing about technology. She pulled out her phone from her jeans pocket and made quick work of deleting all the apps she wasn’t supposed to have (social medias, Uber Eats, Sky News).<br/>
</p><p>“Chop chop, I don’t have all day,” Evanora barked, her left hand moving in a ‘give it here’ gesture.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Yeah, and neither do I.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha handed over the phone.<br/>
</p><p>For what felt like an eternity, her mother poked and prodded at her iPhone as if it were a dead frog that needed dissecting during a science lesson. Agatha regretted not staying at Jen’s last night; the fallout would’ve been astronomical, but she’d take being yelled at over whatever this was.<br/>
</p><p>And she was going to be late for bloody work.<br/>
</p><p>“Would you like some help?” Agatha offered.<br/>
</p><p>“Keep quiet!” Evanora scolded.<br/>
</p><p>Why did she even bother?<br/>
</p><p>Another five minutes passed before Evanora finally said:<br/>
</p><p>“Ah. Here it is,” she turned the phone towards Agatha and pressed play.<br/>
</p><p>The Spanish royal family were on Agatha’s phone screen: Queen Isabella IV, Prince consort Felipe, their eldest child and first in line to the throne, Prince Carlos, Princess Rio-Sofia and their youngest child, Princess Ana, all sat in tailored clothing, their crowns and tiaras sat perfectly on their heads.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stifled an eye roll because why the fuck was she supposed to care about this?<br/>
</p><p>“Me gustaría disculparme…” <em>I would like to apologise…<em>Princess Rio-Sofia started.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha had to keep flicking between watching the video and reading the subtitles. She knew Spanish, she’d done it for her GCSEs and A-levels out of spite after her mother had droned on about how in England people should only speak English. But she was out of practice after two years of disuse.<br/>
</p><p>“...Por mis acciones en las semanas anteriores.” <em>...For my actions last week.<br/>
</em></p><p>As the princess continued her speech, Agatha studied her. She had all the poise of a royal, sitting up straight with her head held high as it bore the weight of her silver tiara that Agatha was sure weighed a couple of tones, and had most likely been stolen from one of the colonies the country had colonised back in the day, but there was something <em>off<em> about the princess.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>It came with the way she kept blinking as if trying to suppress an eyeroll, the way her hands kept tensing as they were clasped in her lap. She seemed almost…annoyed. Agatha didn’t know much about royalty, but she was certain they were supposed to conceal their frustration.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>She’s kind of pretty.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The princess’s rich brown hair fell just passed her shoulders in loose waves, her olive skin was painted with bright pink blush, her long eyelashes were covered in a thick layer of mascara, and her lips were coated in the same colour as her cheeks. She was wearing a light blue Chanel tweed blazer and skirt set.<br/>
</p><p>“…So, maybe you can talk some sense into her,” Evanora said.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked. The screen in front of her was now black. She hadn’t heard a word of that.<br/>
</p><p>She cleared her throat. “Talk some sense into her?” Agatha questioned to try and get her mother to tell her what she’d missed. She couldn’t admit she hadn’t been listening and instead had been distracted by the Spanish princess.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, of course,” her mother said as if it were obvious. “You’re both Catholic. She will listen to you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha most certainly was <em>not<em> catholic.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Hm,” Agatha hummed as she took back her phone and stood with her bowl of half-eaten cereal ready for disposal.<br/>
</p><p>“And you’re the same age,” Evanora continued, following her into the kitchen. “You come from a well-respected family, why wouldn’t the queen not want you to be around her?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded, tucking her hair behind her ear as she poured the rest of her cereal down the sink and loaded her dishes into the dishwasher.<br/>
</p><p>And then it hit her…<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sorry…why would a Spanish princess be around me?”<br/>
</p><p>Her mother’s face twisted into an expression of irritation. “Because you’re going to the same university. Have you not been listening?<br/>
</p><p>
<em>WHAT?!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“No, I was…but KCL has campuses all over London,” Agatha covered quickly. “I doubt I’ll see Rio.”<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Princess Rio-Sofia,<em>” her mother corrected. “Remember to address her correctly.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha fought the urge to scoff. “Right…well, I really should be going now.”<br/>
</p><p>“Fine,” Evanora said.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha headed towards the door until her mother’s voice stopped her.<br/>
</p><p>“Hold it.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, for fucksake. What now?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“When did you do that?” Evanora pointed towards the side of her face.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. What was her mother talking…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh…shit, stupid.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Her ear. A couple of weeks ago, she and Jen had pierced each other’s ears. In addition to her lobe being pierced at sixteen, she now had her: helix, her second, flat and tragus…on both ears. She’d been doing such a good job at hiding them, wearing her thick, dark hair down every time she was around her mother.<br/>
</p><p>She just <em>had<em> to tuck her hair behind her ear didn’t she.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“What’s what?” Agatha feigned obliviousness as she bolted out the door.<br/>
</p><p>Her mother would make her pay for that later.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t recognise herself in the mirror. The outfit (more like costume) she’d been forced to wear, the stupid pink blush and god awful pink lipstick had stripped her of her identity. At least they’d left her hair alone; the only thing they’d done to it was give it heat damage with all the curling irons.<br/>
</p><p>None of this was fair. All she’d done was kiss <em>one<em> girl. Her family and the press were making it seem like she’d murdered someone. Her mother having a heart attack was completely unrelated; she’d been suffering from heart disease. But instead of coming out with it, telling the truth, her family had let the narrative that it was Rio’s fault run wild.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Better to throw your own daughter under the bus than appear weak.<br/>
</p><p>“You look nice.” Her brother Carlos appeared behind her in the mirror.<br/>
</p><p>“Say that again and I’ll stab you,” Rio shot back.<br/>
</p><p>Her brother laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Why do you get to wear a suit and I have to wear this thing?” She indicated to the light blue Chanel set. “We both know I look better in them anyway.”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos shook his head playfully. “See, you say things like that and wonder why mother is punishing you.”<br/>
</p><p>“She doesn’t need to send me away,” Rio mumbled. “If she wants me to go to university so bad, why can’t I just study here in Madrid with you?”<br/>
</p><p>“Because she wants you to suffer,” Carlos grinned. “Have you been practicing your English?” He asked, switching languages.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t need to,” Rio followed suit, English tumbling out of her mouth. “I’ve been fluent since the day I could ride a bike.” She groaned, “But I don’t want to speak English 24/7, I don’t want to be in grey, gloomy London. It was a mistake, why can’t madre see that?”<br/>
</p><p>It wasn’t a mistake. Rio regretted nothing.<br/>
</p><p>Speaking in Spanish again, Carlos said:<br/>
</p><p>“She only wants the best for you, Rio.”<br/>
</p><p>“Bullshit,” Rio muttered.<br/>
</p><p>“Riri!” Their eight-year-old sister Ana dashed into the room, Rio’s tiara in hand.<br/>
</p><p>“Ana!” Her nanny called after her. “You aren’t supposed to touch that!”<br/>
</p><p>The nanny appeared and Carlos politely dismissed her, saying the pair would look after Ana from here. Ana’s nanny blushed and nodded far too many times before she left the room.<br/>
</p><p>Her brother had been born to be king, and there was no doubt in Rio’s mind that he wouldn’t be phenomenal at it. Carlos just did everything so right. He was smart, athletic, gifted, but he was also gentle and compassionate. He was everything a king should be.<br/>
</p><p>“Can I put it on?” Ana giggled as Rio stooped down.<br/>
</p><p>“I wouldn’t want anyone else to crown me,” Rio teased, poking Ana in the stomach.<br/>
</p><p>Her little sister smiled as she placed the tiara on her head. Ana took a step back and admired her handiwork.<br/>
</p><p>“I wish I looked like you,” Ana quietly admitted.<br/>
</p><p>Ana had adopted all of their father’s features, from the blonde hair to the green eyes. Rio and Carlos had all of their mother’s. Ana would often make comments like this; it was a known fact in the Vidal household that her little sister felt left out. The age gap between them didn’t help the issue either.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was twelve years older than her, Carlos fourteen. Ana barely saw them. Whilst they were out at school, or attending charity events, or conferences, Ana had to stay at the palace. Alone (with her nannies).<br/>
</p><p>“And I wish I looked like you,” Rio smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Her sister smiled back, nudging Rio’s tiara off-centre.<br/>
</p><p>“Perfect.”<br/>
</p><p>Ana giggled.<br/>
</p><p>One of the queen’s consultants popped her head around Rio’s bedroom door. “The camera crews are ready for you now.”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos smiled. “Break a leg.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to kill you,” Rio said as she shoved him in the arm.<br/>
</p><p>“And mother’s going to kill you if you don’t fix your tiara.” He centred it on her head.<br/>
</p><p>“Carlos!” Ana whined. “She likes it that way!”<br/>
</p><p>“Do you want mother to yell at her?” He asked as they left the room.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Ana grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“Exactly.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio tilted her tiara back to its original off-centred place anyway.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The throne room was swarming with camera crews, makeup artists, journalists, royal advisors, you name it. Rio felt overstimulated. She wanted this over and done with, and they hadn’t even started yet.<br/>
</p><p>Her tiara had been fixed rightfully on her head, and her lipstick had been touched up four times already.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you remember what you have to say?” Her mother asked from her seat on the throne above.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Rio mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“Now say it again, but annunciate and speak up.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio fought the urge to roll her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes.”<br/>
</p><p>“Good.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio had gone over the awful speech all of last night and the rest of this morning. She was supposed to apologise to the country and the entire world (because that made sense), she was supposed to say that she’d made an unforgivable mistake and brought shame to the Spanish royal family (she regretted nothing and thought her parents should get with the programme, this was the twenty first century), and lastly, she was supposed to say she was thrilled to start attending Kings College London to pursue her education, taking a step back from the royal family to think about what she’d done (the thought of having to live in London for three years threatened to kill her, and again, Rio regretted nothing).<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, places,” someone called from somewhere.<br/>
</p><p>Three people swarmed Rio then, running their fingers through her hair, powdering her face and fixing her crown before they scurried away. The woman behind the camera counted down from three with her fingers, and Rio forced a smile onto her face.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Four hours later, the press conference was over. Everyone was clearing out, and Rio was preparing to head out with them. She needed her bed, no, she needed to share a cigarette with her brother.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia,” the queen called from her throne as Rio was getting off hers.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Rio.<em> She wanted to say. She hated her full name.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>Her father had wanted to call her Rio, but her mother had said the name wasn’t regal, hadn’t been recognised in the Vidal family tree. They had compromised: <em>Rio-Sofia.<br/>
</em></p><p>“Stay a moment, would you, please?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio lowered herself to her seat. It’s not like she had a choice.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos gave her a wary look before picking up Ana and heading out of the throne room with the rest of the camera crews and journalists.<br/>
</p><p>Once Rio was alone with her mother and father, the queen spoke:<br/>
</p><p>“You could’ve been clearer, and you kept fidgeting. What have I told you about fidgeting?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio suppressed the urge to groan. Seriously? Her mother was lecturing her <em>now?<br/>
</em></p><p>“I’m sorry, mother.”<br/>
</p><p>The queen’s face twitched as if she wanted to frown but then remembered who she was. Queen’s did not frown. Queen’s didn’t display any emotions other than indifference or power.<br/>
</p><p>“Now that your name has been cleared and you will hopefully be in Spain’s good graces again, you are not to leave Madrid for the remainder of the summer.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “What?! Mami, you can’t do that!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio had plans to travel this summer with her best friend Alice. They were going to go interrailing throughout Europe, explore parts of South East Asia: Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and lastly, end their trip visiting some of Rio’s dad’s side of the family in Puerto Rico.<br/>
</p><p>It was bad enough that Rio was wasting three years of her life going to a university her mother had paid for her to get into, doing a course she had no interest in, in a country that wasn’t home, and now? Now her mother was taking her summer away from her, too.<br/>
</p><p>The queen narrowed her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry, <em>madre<em>, you can’t do that,” Rio corrected. She’d been forbidden to call her mother ‘mami’ the day she turned five.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I must,” the queen replied. “You cannot be in the public eye at the moment. I can’t risk another photo of you being…intimate with someone of the same gender.”<br/>
</p><p>Why had she said it like that? As if it were some doctoral procedure that needed a clinical review? She’d made out with a girl.<br/>
</p><p>“You think sending me to London is going to make this go away? <em>Fix me?<em> There’s nothing wrong with me. I like women.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You…” the queen cut herself off, red creeping up her neck before she breathed in, and the tint faded. “You do not like women, Rio-Sofia,” she said it as if it were fact. “You were just confused. That other girl took advantage of you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio threw her head back, and when she laughed, there was nothing regal about it. “That old rhetoric. You know everything you’re saying is bullshit, right?”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia!”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio!” her father scolded at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>Why was he even there? He hadn’t said a word until now, just letting her mother say whatever she wanted and nodding along idly.<br/>
</p><p>“Watch your tongue,” the queen ordered. She inhaled sharply. “London will be good for you. People will be keeping an eye on you, we can find you a Catholic community to join, you can focus on your studies and clear your head.”<br/>
</p><p>“My head is perfectly fine,” Rio shot back.<br/>
</p><p>The queen pressed her lips into a thin line. “This is not a punishment. You will see that soon enough. When you return home, you will see it was done for good reason. You will come out of the other side…better.”<br/>
</p><p>Straight. Her mother meant straight.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t know why her mother thought London was going to <em>fix her<em>, but at least she wasn’t sending her to conversion therapy.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Okay,” Rio replied because all the fight had drained out of her, and she really did want her bed and that cigarette. “May I leave now?”<br/>
</p><p>Her mother regarded her for a moment before curtly nodding. “Yes, you are dismissed.”<br/>
</p><p>Dismissed. As if Rio were one of her employees and not her daughter.<br/>
</p><p>She said nothing as she got up and left the room.<br/>
</p><p>In three months, Rio was going to be in hell.</p>

<strong>Present day.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Agatha was sweating. She’d had to lug what felt like her entire life through her university accommodation into her new room, mostly by herself. Her mother made it clear she wouldn’t be helping her move in. 
</p><p>Luckily, she had a best friend whose mother loved her as if she were her own. Jen’s mum had driven her and Jen to London and somehow made room to fit both of their belongings in the car.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had spent the fifty-minute journey in the back of their car, surrounded by boxes and luggage cases. 
</p><p>Jen’s mum had to switch between helping Agatha with her stuff and Jen’s. But Jen, the notorious overpacker, had taken most of her mother’s attention. Not that Agatha minded. Jen was her actual daughter; Agatha was just a stray she’d adopted.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, I gotta go,” Jen’s mum said when the last box had been moved into Jen’s room. “They only give us twenty-minute slots for parking. I’ll be back to drop off a week’s worth of food shopping for you both, but then you’re on your own,” she teased.<br/>
</p><p>“Thanks, mum.”<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t have to do that,” Agatha and Jen said at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>As much as Agatha appreciated it, she didn’t want Jen’s mum spending money on her. She always did far too much for her, and Agatha could never return the favour. She didn’t want to think about how much money she owed her best friend's mother, but the thought that she’d be a well-established lawyer in the years to come, and she could finally pay her back, motivated her.<br/>
</p><p>“Nonsense,” Jen’s mother, Valerie, replied. “You are my favourite daughter after all.”<br/>
</p><p>“Hey!” Jen frowned as Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“I love you both. See you in a bit.”<br/>
</p><p>“Love you, mum.”<br/>
</p><p>“Love you, Val,” Agatha and Jen replied simultaneously as Valerie left the room.<br/>
</p><p>When Jen’s door clicked shut and the room was plunged into silence, it hit Agatha. She had done it. She’d left their shitty little village and made it to London. She was going to be studying at her first-choice university, and to top it all off, her best friend was with her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha and Jen turned to each other slowly, and as if they shared the same brain cell, they grabbed each other’s hands, jumping and squealing.<br/>
</p><p>When the moment passed, they let go of one another and cleared their throats.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s never do that again,” Jen shuddered.<br/>
</p><p>“Agreed.”<br/>
</p><p>“Babe, actually deep it,” Jen said, dropping down on her bed. “We lucked the fuck out.”<br/>
</p><p>“We did,” Agatha agreed, sitting next to her. “Same uni, same acom, same flat! I don’t know how we did it.”<br/>
</p><p>And she really didn’t. Agatha and misfortunes had a two-decade-old beef…guess who was winning. Let’s see: dad died at the age of two, she’d spent her life practicing a faith she didn’t believe in, she never had a proper childhood, abusive conservative mother, said abuse conservative mother was an extreme homophobe (Agatha was a lesbian), the list went on.<br/>
</p><p>“And we live in London now,” Jen added.<br/>
</p><p>“And we live in London,” Agatha echoed.<br/>
</p><p>“Now get out. I want to start organising my room,” Jen said, shoving her off the bed.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha batted her hand away. “I’m going! I hope one your many boxes falls on your head now.”<br/>
</p><p>“Thanks,” Jen deadpanned as she left the room.<br/>
</p><p>Their rooms weren’t next to each other. Jen’s was by the flat door, and Agatha’s was by the kitchen. The two doors separating them were for their other flatmates. 
</p><p>Agatha hoped they were at least decent people. She’d heard the stories, nightmare flatmates, and whilst she had no problem dealing with people who pissed her off, she would rather avoid it in the place she had to live. She’d already lived twenty years of hell with her mother, she needed a break.<br/>
</p><p>She made her way down the corridor and pushed her door open. She took in the space that would be her home for the next year. It was an ensuite thank fuck. She didn’t know if she’d be able to handle a communal bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>Her bathroom was on her left by her front door, ahead was the main section of the room and on the right her wardrobe. Her bed was against the wall opposite the window, a desk that ran the width of the room below it. There were three storage cubbies above her bed, shelves on the opposite wall below drawers that were also a bench, and a board to stick pictures on.<br/>
</p><p>She put her hands behind her head and stared at the room filled with her unpacked belongings. The task, unpacking, felt overwhelming, but she had to start somewhere. She inhaled before opening the first box and getting to work.<br/>
</p><p>An hour later, Agatha was just about done. She’d put all her clothes away, set up her desk (laid out her laptop, stationery, lamp, chargers), made her bed, and put away her luggage case and storage boxes underneath it (with some help from Jen, the bed weighed a ton). Now all she had to do was decorate.<br/>
</p><p>She’d bought candles (which she technically wasn’t supposed to have because they were a fire hazard), posters, fairy lights, fake plants (because she couldn’t keep the real ones alive to save her life), blankets and cushions and pictures (of her and Jen, she didn’t have any other friends).<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was midway through sticking a poster of the outline of two women’s faces just before they kissed when there was a knock on her door.<br/>
</p><p>“Mum’s back, kitchen,” Jen ordered.<br/>
</p><p>“Coming,” Agatha called back.<br/>
</p><p>She hopped off her bed, slipped on her slippers (because she wouldn’t be caught dead walking around the flat without shoes on) and made her way to the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>“Have you decided fridge space, cupboards, etc?” Valerie asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Jen answered. “But we’re the first ones here we should be alright.”<br/>
</p><p>As soon as she said it, they heard their front door beep, it opened and closed, and footsteps and laughter sounded from the corridor.<br/>
</p><p>Seconds later, a girl with a black and red streaked wolf cut and a red head appeared at the kitchen door.<br/>
</p><p>“Holy shit!” The girl with the wolf cut screamed, putting a hand over her heart. “I mean…I’m so sorry, I wasn’t expecting anyone to be in here.”<br/>
</p><p>“That’s alright,” Valerie smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m Alice,” Alice extended her arm towards Jen’s mum.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…and I’m Wanda,” the redhead added.<br/>
</p><p>There was no denying it, Wanda was hot. And Agatha realised so was Alice.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Hold it. You’re just saying that because you haven’t been sexually active…like…ever.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>And it wasn’t like she didn’t <em>want<em> to be. She simply couldn’t. Nobody knew she was gay. Before she discovered she was, she’d kissed one boy at fourteen and immediately thrown up the second his lips touched hers. If that wasn’t a sign, Agatha didn’t know what was.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The only girl she’d ever kissed was Jen. When her best friend came out to her, Agatha did too. It had been one of the happiest days of her life. She was scared her best friend would cut her off if she ever discovered the truth about her sexuality. They lived in a small village in the middle of fucking nowhere bringing the queer people count to two, three if she counted the church clerk she caught making out with the priests son.<br/>
</p><p>She and Jen had traded one kiss, albeit a passionate one with tongue and hair pulling. They both wanted to know what it would feel like to kiss another woman. They’d never spoken about it again.<br/>
</p><p>But now she was in London, there were just as many queer women as there were electric scooters.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was planning on having a field day. She had years of sexual experiences she needed to catch up on.<br/>
</p><p>“So I’m guessing you’re our flatmates,” Jen stated.<br/>
</p><p>“Jennifer!” Her mother scolded.<br/>
</p><p>Alice only laughed. “I am. Wanda lives next door.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda nodded.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help noticing Alice’s accent. What was that? Spanish?<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, well, I’m Jen.”<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, it was nice to meet you both. You wouldn’t be interested in field hockey by any chance, would you?”<br/>
</p><p>“Alice,” Wanda smacked her in the arm. “They just got here, let them unpack first.”<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry,” Alice said with a smile. “We’re second years, and I just became hockey captain; I’m starting the recruiting early.”<br/>
</p><p>“I do,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>During secondary school, her mother only let her leave the house outside of school for one of two reasons: going to church or going to hockey practice.<br/>
</p><p>“Jen pretends like she can, but she can’t,” Agatha continued.<br/>
</p><p>“Watch it, Harkness. Remember the time a hockey ball hit you in the head? I could easily do it again, but on purpose this time.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled as Valerie shook her head playfully.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t know how you two haven’t murdered each other yet,” she said as she started putting some of the food she bought in the fridge.<br/>
</p><p>“Brilliant!” Alice said. “You two should definitely come to tryouts next week.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glanced at Jen, who nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay.”<br/>
</p><p>“Perfect. Hasta Luego,” Alice replied as she and Wanda left the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>So, she is Spanish.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“She seems nice,” Valerie commented.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha replied. “Let’s just hope our other flatmate is too.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>It’d been a week since Agatha had first moved in, and there had been no sign of their other flatmate, not that she’d minded.<br/>
</p><p>During the week, she and Jen had explored their campus together (the Strand Campus). They’d lucked out again because even though they were on different courses (Jen was doing politics), they would still be in the same place for the most part (Agatha also had lectures at the Waterloo campus).<br/>
</p><p>They’d gone to their introductory lectures, explored London a bit (they’d visited the Tate Modern, Camden, Covent Garden), and done a four-night bender during freshers week.<br/>
</p><p>From Thursday to Sunday, the girls had been out every night. Agatha had spent far too much money on alcohol and club tickets, where they’d had to pay at the door, making the tickets far more expensive as well as having to stand in queues for over an hour some nights because they had been stupid and not prebought tickets.<br/>
</p><p>They’d bumped into Alice on the Saturday night, and she’d introduced them to some of the hockey girls. They already knew Wanda, but in addition to her, they’d made friends with Natasha, Monica, Darcy and Gamora.<br/>
</p><p>It was Tuesday after hockey tryouts, and Jen had refused to go, claiming she was too hungover even though she’d had over a day to recover. Agatha blamed Alice for her lack of attendance. 
</p><p>On the Sunday night the two had disappeared somewhere, and when they returned an hour later, Jen’s lipstick was smudged. She’d also heard Alice say something about not worrying about going to tryouts. So, Agatha assumed their hockey captain had gone soft on her, which meant an easy in.<br/>
</p><p>But it wasn’t like Agatha could judge. On the Thursday night she made out with one girl, on the Friday, she’d made out with three and one of them was before she’d even gotten into the club, it had been in the queue outside. On the Saturday and Sunday, she’d been with Wanda…slept with Wanda.<br/>
</p><p>She’d surprised herself. She’d thought it would take her at least a month to have sex with someone for the first time…apparently not.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha forced herself up the stairs. Her legs ached, and her body felt like it was about to shut down. And the one day she actually needed to use the lift, it was bloody broken. Why the fuck did they have to live on the fifth floor? 
</p><p>After four days of living off of alcohol, cigarettes, vapes and good vibes, the four-day bender was finally catching up to her. She was actually shocked she hadn’t thrown up after the gruelling two hour and a half hockey session.<br/>
</p><p>What felt like an eternity later, Agatha made it to their flat door. Maybe she needed to lay off the cigarettes, she shouldn’t be sweating and panting after climbing five flights of stairs. 
</p><p>She fumbled around in her skort pocket for her key card. She needed a shower; her hockey kit was sticking to her body and the pieces of hair that had fallen out of her ponytail would not get the fuck off her forehead no matter how many times she swiped at them<br/>
</p><p>She also needed to eat. Her stomach felt empty like when it does after a night out.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha went to tap her key card against their front door when it slipped out of her hand. She muttered expletives as she bent down to pick it up, her hockey stick in her hockey bag sliding down and hitting her on the head. She almost threw it.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha inhaled once before retrieving her key card and tapping it against the door. She needed food now before she broke something.<br/>
</p><p>She let herself into the flat and made a beeline for the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>What did she have? Most of the food Valerie had bought them last week was still in the fridge, the girls had barely eaten any of their own food. 
</p><p>When they hadn’t been going out out, they’d eat in the city, and when they had, they’d sleep during the day and get food from food trucks at the end of the night.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha vaguely remembered having chicken and tortilla wraps in the fridge. She was sure she had peppers and onions too; she could make fajitas.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, for fucksake!” Agatha groaned.<br/>
</p><p>In her kitchen were five men and women in all black suits. They were essentially picking the place apart. The chairs around the island had been flipped upside down and put on the table, the fridge had been pulled out, the cupboards had been emptied, their sofa had been removed.<br/>
</p><p>“What the hell are you doing?!” Agatha demanded.<br/>
</p><p>When one of the beefier men made a move towards her, Agatha didn’t flinch. She could take him. She was pissed off, starving, and armed with a hockey stick.<br/>
</p><p>“Déjala.” <em>Leave it.<em> A voice spoke.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The man stepped back, and a girl with dark brown hair came into view.<br/>
</p><p>It was the fucking Spanish princess.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, for fucksake,” Agatha grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>After wasting away in the palace for the entire summer, the dreaded day had come. Rio was moving to London.<br/>
</p><p>To say she had regrets about spending her last night in Madrid getting paralytically drunk and smoking cigarettes with her brother in the palace gardens wouldn’t be true. The only thing Rio regretted was not drinking a gallon of water before she went to bed. She was violently hungover.<br/>
</p><p>She was curled up in a ball on one of the chairs on the royal’s private jet, sunglasses on, hoodie up, hair over her face so nobody could see it. She had a splitting headache, and the altitude was doing nothing for her nausea.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had only been on the jet for an hour now, and she already missed home. She missed her little sister running into her room at the early hours of the morning with far too much energy, she missed playfighting with her brother around the palace with Nerf guns when he didn’t have some princely obligation. She missed her room. 
</p><p>She missed Spain. She missed her freedom.<br/>
</p><p>Tears began to prick her eyes, and she hastily wiped them away.<br/>
</p><p>She needed a plan. If she caused enough trouble in London, her mother would have no choice but to drag her back to Madrid. Most of Rio’s rebellion had been concealed behind the palace walls, not that she’d done anything <em>too<em> crazy. She just wore black eyeliner and eyeshadow, wore ‘masculine’ clothes as her mother put it, smoked and drank, which her mother had labelled as ‘boyish behaviour’ even though it was perfectly fine when Carlos did it.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Thinking about the double standard between her and her brother always made Rio feel violent because who the fuck cared? Had her mother never heard of intersectional feminism? Equality for all? Just because they were royalty didn’t mean they should uphold patriarchal standards. In fact, being in the public eye, they should be proudly trying to dismantle the thing with all of the influence they had.<br/>
</p><p>Did her mother not understand that she’d been the fourth queen in Spain’s entire history, whereas the country had had copious kings?<br/>
</p><p>Anyways, Rio just needed to start rebelling publicly. There was already a buzz around her considering the whole making out with a girl thing, she just had to ramp it up a notch.<br/>
</p><p>Rio woke up to the sound of the pilot announcing they were to land in twenty minutes. She rubbed the sleet from her eyes. When had she fallen asleep?<br/>
</p><p>“You’re up. Good,” the queen started.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was surprised her mother had left her alone for so long.<br/>
</p><p>“You must change into the clothes I have picked out for you,” her mother told her.<br/>
</p><p>It was <em>another<em> tweed Chanel set except this time it was fucking baby pink.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Could I wear something else?” Rio bargained.<br/>
</p><p>“No, Rio-Sofia. You may not.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t bother suppressing her eyeroll.<br/>
</p><p>“I saw that,” the queen scolded. “Get up and get dressed,” she ordered.<br/>
</p><p>Begrudgingly, Rio did as she was told.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio was sitting across from her mother at a private table at the Ritz whilst the royal security moved all of her belongings into her dorm room. One of the only good things about going to KCL was that it was the university her best friend went to. And by the grace of whoever, her mother had allowed her to live with Alice in her flat.<br/>
</p><p>The original plan was to get Rio a private studio, but she’d convinced her mother that she would do better being around someone she knew. ‘Don’t you want me to get the proper university experience?’ Rio had said. ‘I thought London was supposed to ground me, bring me back to reality.’<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t believe a word she was saying, but the bullshit worked, and the queen was swayed.<br/>
</p><p>“You will have your head of security with you at all times,” her mother said without looking up from the menu she was reading.<br/>
</p><p>“Why?”<br/>
</p><p>“For your protection. To make sure you don’t step out of line.”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t think I need it,” Rio tried to reason. “I didn’t need it back in Madrid.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Madrid.<em> Home. How she missed it dearly, and she hadn’t even been in London for more than two hours yet.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“Well, you aren’t in Madrid, are you?” The question was rhetorical because fucking clearly Rio wasn’t in Madrid.<br/>
</p><p>Rio huffed and started picking at the corners of her menu.<br/>
</p><p>They sat in an uneasy near silence, the classical music of the restaurant, the quiet murmur of distant conversations and the clinking of cutlery against plates filled the void.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia,” the queen spoke moments later.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, mother,” Rio answered.<br/>
</p><p>“I mean it. One step out of line and you will be sent somewhere far worse than a university in London.”<br/>
</p><p>And there went Rio’s plan for rebellion.<br/>
</p><p>She swallowed. “Yes, mother.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The queen had been and gone, leaving Rio to travel back to her university accommodation in her own private car. Her mother had made it clear she was only permitted to travel like this. No walking, no tubes, no buses. She had to notify her driver whenever she wanted to leave her flat, and they would come and take her to wherever she needed to go.<br/>
</p><p>She felt like a prisoner.<br/>
</p><p>When she arrived at her accommodation in Euston, she made her way up the five flights of stairs because the lift was broken, and her head of security let her into the flat as if she didn’t have her own pair of fucking hands.<br/>
</p><p>She knocked on the door that was labelled ‘Alice’ with stickers of glittery guitars, drum sets, and stars on it. No answer. Her best friend wasn’t in. She couldn’t even call her; she wasn’t allowed her phone until later.<br/>
</p><p>Rio went into her own room. Everything had been unpacked and organised in a way she absolutely despised. She’d have to redo it later. When she walked into the kitchen…it didn’t look like a kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Qué estás haciendo?” <em>What are you doing?<em> She asked her security team.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Controles de seguridad, princesa.” <em>Security checks, princess.<em> One of the women replied.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio nodded. This felt a bit excessive.<br/>
</p><p>And that’s when she heard it. The slam of the front door. Was that Alice?<br/>
</p><p>It was not Alice.<br/>
</p><p>Now standing in the doorway of the kitchen was a girl. She wore a navy blue hockey shirt with a V-neckline and matching skort, navy blue hockey socks that reached just below her knees and white astro shoes. She had a purple <em>Grays<em> hockey stick bag slung across her body, and her long, dark hair was tied up in a high ponytail, revealing her ears that were decorated with various gold earrings.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She was…beautiful.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, for fucksake! What the hell are you doing?!” The girl demanded.<br/>
</p><p>The security guard who was blocking Rio from the girl’s view stepped forward.<br/>
</p><p>"Déjala.” <em>Leave it.<em> Rio told him.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>When he stepped back, blue eyes locked onto her. The girl’s eyebrows furrowed briefly before they smoothed out into an expression Rio could only describe as irritation.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, for fucksake,” she grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“Lo siento…I’m sorry?” Rio corrected because she forgot she had to speak English now.<br/>
</p><p>“Why are your people destroying the kitchen?” The girl demanded.<br/>
</p><p>Rio jerked her head, slightly taken aback. She hated how people treated her differently just because she was a princess, but nobody she wasn’t friends with had spoken to her like that before. She had to hand it to her; the girl was brave.<br/>
</p><p>“They are just following protocol,” Rio defended, even though she didn’t know why they were doing it herself.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman scoffed. “And following protocol means destroying my entire kitchen because?” She turned to all the food that was spread across the kitchen counters. “Hey! That stuff's supposed to be in the fridge!” She surged forward, and one of Rio’s security put a firm hand out, blocking her from advancing.<br/>
</p><p>The girl narrowed her eyes. “You seriously want to do that when I have a hockey stick in reach?”<br/>
</p><p>The security guard blinked.<br/>
</p><p>Whoever this girl was, she was fearless.<br/>
</p><p>“Déjala.” <em>Leave it.<em> Rio told him again.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The security guard backed down.<br/>
</p><p>“They have to dispose of it,” Rio told her. “It hasn’t been checked…it might be contaminated.” <em>Poisoned.<em> The Spanish royal family had numerous enemies, just like any other royal family.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“And you think <em>I<em> would try and harm you? One, why would you be eating my food? Two, I didn’t even know you were going to be here until two fucking seconds ago.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio had to admit, she did have a good point.<br/>
</p><p>“It must be done, I’m sorry. All food has to be checked before it comes into the flat from now on,” she reiterated what her mother had told her earlier.<br/>
</p><p>“Bloody brilliant,” the girl muttered.<br/>
</p><p>Alice burst into the room then. “Rio! ¡Estás aquí!” She ran over and hugged her, hockey bag and all.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed. “Hola, Alice.”<br/>
</p><p>Her best friend pulled back and took in her surroundings. “Eh…” she turned on the spot, her hand gesturing to the state of the room. “¿Por qué?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio sighed. “Mi madre.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ah,” Alice nodded. “¿Cómo estás tú?”<br/>
</p><p>“No estoy bien.”<br/>
</p><p>“No?”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio echoed.<br/>
</p><p>“Esh,” Alice replied. She nodded towards the kitchen door. “Vamos.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice stopped short when she noticed the other girl was there.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, hey, Agatha,” Alice said. “I’m sorry, I didn’t see you.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha. So that’s her name.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Alice indicated between the pair. “Have you guys introduced yourselves?”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha replied curtly.<br/>
</p><p>Sharp blue eyes locked onto Rio, and Rio found herself doing the same because why was this girl staring at her like she’d murdered her family?<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…” Alice said, picking up on the tension. “Agatha, this is Rio – I mean – Princess Rio-Sofia. I always forget I’m not allowed to introduce you like that,” Alice whispered to her. “Princess Rio-Sofia, this is our flatmate, Agatha.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha only folded her arms, her glare unwavering.<br/>
</p><p>Alice, sensing that no more words were going to be exchanged between the pair said:<br/>
</p><p>“Okay…we’re going to go. Good job at practice today, Agatha.” Alice began tugging Rio out of the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait, Alice, what am I going to do about dinner? I haven’t eaten since lunch, and these bimbos won’t let me eat the food in the fridge,” she indicated to Rio’s security.<br/>
</p><p>“You should’ve eaten more at lunch then,” Rio snapped before her best friend had a chance to reply. She was aware she shouldn’t have, but this Agatha girl had pissed her right the fuck off.<br/>
</p><p>She was rude, entitled, and demanding for no fucking reason. Rio hadn’t even done anything, and the girl was acting as if Rio’s mere existence had ruined her life.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry, Agatha. Try Wanda’s, she should have something,” Alice replied softly before dragging Rio out of the kitchen before the two had a chance to snap at each other again.</p>

<p>Agatha pounded on Jen’s bedroom door.<br/>
</p><p>“Jen!” She knocked again. “Jen! Open the fucking door!”<br/>
</p><p>Moments later, she heard shuffling on the other side of the door, the lock unlocking, and her best friend blinking at her as if she’d just woken up.<br/>
</p><p>It was 6 PM.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha barged in, shoving her best friend aside. She squinted so that her eyes could adjust to the low lighting of Jen’s room. Her blackout curtains were drawn shut. The only light emitted came from the string of fairy lights that Jen had strung up along her walls.<br/>
</p><p>“The fucking princess of Spain is here!” She told her.<br/>
</p><p>Jen climbed back into bed and croaked a, “What?”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re hungover, not deaf.”<br/>
</p><p>Her best friend rubbed her eyes. “You were the one who told me she was going to KCL. Why are you surprised?”<br/>
</p><p>“No! As in, she is <em>here<em> in our flat.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Jen leaned back against her headboard. “Ah.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha gaped at her.<br/>
</p><p>Jen shot up. “Wait…what?!”<br/>
</p><p>“Finally. You’re getting it,” Agatha groaned as she slumped onto the bed, not caring that she’d sat on her best friend's leg.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, no. No outside clothes on my bed, especially your hockey kit. You’re all sweaty.” She tried to shove Agatha off, but she didn’t budge.<br/>
</p><p>“And guess what? Her fucking security are throwing out all our food.”<br/>
</p><p>“What?!” Jen repeated. “No! My mother bought that stuff with her hard-earned money.” Jen stirred as if to get up.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pushed her back down. “Don’t bother, they won’t hear it. Trust me, I tried.”<br/>
</p><p>“For fucksake,” Jen muttered.<br/>
</p><p>“And she’s a bitch. Not prim and proper like we’d thought she’d be.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen furrowed her eyebrows. “You spoke to her?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah. I wanted to make dinner, you know, because I’m fucking starving and had just done over two hours of hockey – it was good by the way – you missed out. And obviously they were throwing out the food and I told Alice I hadn’t eaten since lunch and the bitchy princess said, and I quote, ‘You should’ve eaten more at lunch then.’”<br/>
</p><p>“Damn,” Jen acknowledged.<br/>
</p><p>“I know.” Agatha threw her hands up. “And her people have destroyed the kitchen. You know the comfy sofa?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah.”<br/>
</p><p>“Gone.”<br/>
</p><p>“What?!” Jen shrieked again. “What the hell!”<br/>
</p><p>“And all the foods gotta be checked before it comes into the flat in case its poisoned or some shit.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen blinked. “They think we’d try and hurt her?”<br/>
</p><p>“I mean, I wasn’t planning on it, but now I am,” Agatha joked half-heartedly.<br/>
</p><p>Jen smacked her on the arm. “Shush! You might end up on some Spanish government watch list.”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t give a fuck!” Agatha groaned as she fell backward on the bed, her head hitting Jen’s knee. When her best friend cried out, she ignored it. “I’m fucking starving and that fucked up princess is now our new flatmate.”<br/>
</p><p>She’d rewatched the speech after her mother had shown it to her because the first time, she’d only been watching Rio, not actually listening to her. The Spanish princess had claimed that she’d made the worst mistake of her life by kissing that girl in the photo. She’d told the entire world that she didn’t know what she was doing and regretted the entire thing.<br/>
</p><p>She was a fake bitch with no backbone. Agatha thought that if you’d done something and it was caught on camera that you should fucking own it. Not backpedal and say you’ve disgraced your entire family because you kissed a woman.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha thought there was nothing more beautiful than having the privilege to do so.<br/>
</p><p>“You could go over to Wanda’s,” Jen suggested.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glanced at her. “That’s what Alice said.”<br/>
</p><p>“Then do it. Have you seen her today?”<br/>
</p><p>“Jen, we’re not fucking dating. I don’t have to see her every day…and I saw her at practice.”<br/>
</p><p>Her best friend laughed.<br/>
</p><p>She and Wanda had agreed that they weren’t going to be a <em>thing<em>, it’d just be casual. Sure, she’d taken Agatha’s virginity, talked her through it, made her come more than she’d thought humanly possible. But Agatha was still only a freshly out lesbian. She didn’t plan on settling down any time soon. The world was her oyster.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Well, all my food's in the bin with yours. Wanda’s your safest bet.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha groaned. “Alright.”<br/>
</p><p>She left Jen’s room, chucked her hockey gear into hers, and made the short walk (literally two steps) to the flat next door.<br/>
</p><p>She knocked and waited.<br/>
</p><p>A short while later, Natasha opened the door. She smiled smugly.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha, back so soon?”<br/>
</p><p>It’d been less than twenty-four hours since she’d last been in their flat.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha ignored her comment. “Is Wanda in?”<br/>
</p><p>“Wanda!” Natasha called. “It appears you have a suitor.”<br/>
</p><p>The other redhead appeared from the kitchen down the hall. She made her way over with a smile on her face.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, Agatha. What’s up?”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda was also in her navy hockey kit, except she’d taken her hair out of its ponytail.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glanced at Natasha, who was still standing between them, her hands clasped in front of her expectantly as if she were waiting for the conversation to occur.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda, catching her gist, turned to Natasha. “Nat?”<br/>
</p><p>She nodded once. “Right.” She turned and headed towards her room.<br/>
</p><p>When her door clicked shut, Agatha said:<br/>
</p><p>“You wouldn’t happen to have any food, would you? All mine's been put in the bin.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow.<br/>
</p><p>“The princess of Spain moved in.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh! Rio-Sofia’s here?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha jerked her head back. “You know her?”<br/>
</p><p>“Know <em>of<em> her. She’s Alice’s best friend.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha nodded slowly.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda snapped her fingers as if she’d remembered why Agatha was there. “Food? No, but do you wanna grab Subway?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’d eat anything right now.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda laughed. “Okay, then. Let’s go.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Subway had a deal on. A six-inch sub, a packet of crisps or a cookie, and a drink. Agatha had gone for a Subway Club, a milk chocolate chip cookie, and a bottle of Blackcurrant Apple Oasis. Wanda had chosen a Spicy Italian, a packet of Quavers, and a bottle of Sprite.<br/>
</p><p>Now the pair were sitting across from each other in the Subway, a ten-minute walk away from the accommodation.<br/>
</p><p>“You better not try and kiss me after you’ve eaten those,” Agatha teased as Wanda chomped on a Quaver.<br/>
</p><p>“You wouldn’t kiss me with onion breath?” Wanda joked back.<br/>
</p><p>“Over my dead body.”<br/>
</p><p>“So…” Wanda said, licking her thumb. “You <em>want<em> me to kiss you outside of sex? Outside of clubbing?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>And Agatha had walked right into that one. She made a mental note to remind herself not to jump at every opportunity to make a joke when it presented itself to her.<br/>
</p><p>It was a good thing she’d mastered the art of deflecting. “Do you want to kiss me outside of it?”<br/>
</p><p>“And what if I did?” Wanda answered straight away.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes before taking a sip of her drink. “Aren’t you fucking that guy on the men’s hockey team? What’s his name? Vision?”<br/>
</p><p>“And what if I am?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head playfully.<br/>
</p><p>“I know you don’t plan on only sleeping with just me, so why can’t I?”<br/>
</p><p>“I never said you couldn’t,” Agatha laughed. “I only asked if you wanted to kiss <em>me<em> outside of sex.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“And I do.”<br/>
</p><p>This was going to get messy, and thank fuck Agatha had grown up sheltered and catholic because she was so ready to welcome <em>messy<em> into her life.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said nonchalantly.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda smiled before she took a sip of her own drink. She shuddered. “I regret the Sprite, too many bubbles.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed. “It’s almost as if it’s a fizzy drink.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda shrugged, that smile still on her lips. “Swap with me for a bit?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha handed Wanda her bottle of Oasis.<br/>
</p><p>She watched as the redhead took a long drink from the bottle before pulling it away from her lips, a trail of saliva following in its wake. She hadn’t broken eye contact once.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck. Why was that hot?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha blinked.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Calm the fuck down. You can’t be this easy, you’re acting like a man.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“How did you find hockey practice?” Wanda asked as if she didn’t know exactly what she was doing.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha acted as if Wanda’s little performance had no effect on her. “It was good. Alice and Natasha are good captains.”<br/>
</p><p>“They are,” Wanda agreed. “You know if you get in, you’re going to have to do the initiation process.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. “What the hell is that?”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda shrugged. “I guess you’ll have to wait and see.”<br/>
</p><p>“Wanda,” Agatha said firmly.<br/>
</p><p>The redhead only giggled.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>“But do you know what I mean, Alice?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio had been ranting in Spanish and pacing around Alice’s room for the past ten minutes.<br/>
</p><p>“And that fucked up princess is our new flatmate,” Rio heard through the wall.<br/>
</p><p>She pointed at the wall as if it were the culprit. “Did you hear that? Did you hear the way she spoke about me?!” Rio whisper yelled.<br/>
</p><p>The walls in their accommodation were thin, and Alice shared a wall with the other flatmate whom she hadn’t met yet.<br/>
</p><p>“And did you see the way she <em>looked<em> at me? As if I was the fucking devil on earth, as if my presence had caused her this massive inconvenience.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Well…” Alice spoke for the first time since they’d gone into her room. “It kinda did.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio glared at her.<br/>
</p><p>Alice laughed. “Ri, she’d just come back from hockey practice. She was probably starving, and your security team was binning all of her food.”<br/>
</p><p>“I didn’t fucking as them too!”<br/>
</p><p>“No, I know,” Alice replied calmly. “But try and think about how she must feel. About how much money she spent on food for it all to go to waste. I knew you were coming, so I hadn’t bought anything this week yet, they didn’t.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio folded her arms. She knew this, but it was just the way <em>Agatha<em> had looked at her, kept looking at her, that had rubbed her the wrong way.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Hm.” She sat down on Alice’s bed. “You think I have enough authority to get her put in another flat?”<br/>
</p><p>Her best friend blinked at her. “…Ri.”<br/>
</p><p>“What.”<br/>
</p><p>“You can’t be serious. Why would you do that?”<br/>
</p><p>“Because I don’t like the way she spoke to me, and I can already tell she’s going to be a problem.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice chucked. “Wow, the princess in you is really coming out today, huh?”<br/>
</p><p>She furrowed her eyebrows until she realised what her best friend meant. She was acting like an entitled brat. The one thing she absolutely despised. Was she serious? Trying to get a girl kicked out of their flat because she’d looked at her funny? That was very pathetic on Rio’s part.<br/>
</p><p>“What is she going to eat, Al?” Rio asked quietly, the guilt consuming her all at once.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sure Agatha will be alright,” Alice reassured her. “She’s probably going to Wanda’s.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. Alice had mentioned Wanda before, she was one of her friends on the hockey team.<br/>
</p><p>“Speaking of…are you going to join the hockey team?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio huffed. “Didn’t I miss tryouts? You told me they were today.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah…but I’m captain. If you want in, you’re in.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “Isn’t that an abuse of power?”<br/>
</p><p>Alice shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>The pair sat in a comfortable silence before Alice said:<br/>
</p><p>“I know what will help.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “With what?”<br/>
</p><p>“With getting on Jen and Agatha’s good side.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio turned to face her best friend. “What?”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, firstly, by replacing the sofa. It was really comfortable. And secondly, rebuy all their food.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. “That’s good, Al.”<br/>
</p><p>“I know,” Alice smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Also…what’s up with the outfit?” Her best friend looked her up and down, her face twisted in concern.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t ask about it,” Rio said abruptly. “I need to change.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio had sent out her security detail to buy everything they’d thrown away from Jen and Agatha’s cupboards and fridges, whilst getting them to buy her and Alice’s weekly shop too.<br/>
</p><p>She’d reorganised her room to the way she liked it, stripping off the pink bed covers and replacing them with forest green ones. She’d discovered her box of plants that had been stashed away in her wardrobe and put them where they had the best opportunity to catch the light. She’d stuck up photos of her siblings, Alice, and her friends back in Spain on the photo board. And she’d changed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio would burn the baby pink number if she could, but instead she’d neatly folded it and stuffed it in the back of her wardrobe. She’d pulled on an XL pair of baggy grey sweatpants that revealed the band of her <em>Calvin Klein<em> black boxers, and a matching sports bra. Her room was boiling, and she didn’t have a fan yet. The open window was doing nothing.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She could also, <em>finally<em>, put the rest of her earrings back in. Her mother only approved of her wearing her firsts and seconds. Whilst Rio had been away at boarding school, her friend had learnt how to pierce ears. She’d come back home for the summer at fifteen with a silver bar through her new industrial piercing and a stud in her tragus.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>When Rio looked in the mirror, she actually recognised herself. She was only missing the eyeliner on her waterline and on her eyelids, but apart from that, Rio, not Princess Rio-Sofia, was staring back at her.<br/>
</p><p>She nodded, a satisfied smile on her face.<br/>
</p><p>A knock on the door. “¿Princesa? Hemos vuelto con la comida.” <em>Princess? We have returned with the food. One of Rio’s security told her.<br/>
</em></p><p>“Gracias,” Rio called through the door.<br/>
</p><p>She left her room, almost walking into the back of her head of security, who was parked up outside her front door and made her way over to Alice’s.<br/>
</p><p>Rio knocked. “Alimento.” <em>Food.<em> She told her best friend.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Alice pulled her door open. “¿En serio?” <em>Seriously?<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“¡Gracias! Me muero de hambre.” <em>Thanks! I’m starving.<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio smiled as her best friend bolted towards the kitchen, barely avoiding Rio’s head of security as she passed him.<br/>
</p><p>The kitchen had been put back to normal, and they’d gotten a new sofa. This one was in an L shape and navy blue. Rio hoped it was just as comfortable as the other one her security had gotten rid of. And she still wasn’t sure why they’d done it.<br/>
</p><p>Alice started rummaging through the fridge. When she shut the door, a frozen pizza in hand, she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, hi, Jen.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio turned to see a girl with a lean figure and brown skin. She was wearing pink plaid pyjama bottoms and a matching tank top, pink fluffy UGG slippers on her feet.<br/>
</p><p>Jen eyed Rio before she said, “Err…hi?”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia, this is our other flatmate, Jen.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re the princess?” Jen asked, her confusion clear. “You didn’t look like that in the video.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t know if she should be offended or not. It technically was a good thing she didn’t look like the fake version of herself with the pink blush and lipstick, but was Jen saying that she looked worse?<br/>
</p><p>She certainly understood why she and Agatha were friends now. She’d heard the other girl stomp over to Jen’s room as soon as she’d gone into Alice’s, and it was clear by the way they were talking to each other that they were well acquainted.<br/>
</p><p>Jen, just like her friend, was speaking to her as if she were anyone and not a Spanish princess, which was actually…fine.<br/>
</p><p>Now that Rio thought about it, she appreciated it.<br/>
</p><p>“I am, yes.”<br/>
</p><p>“Huh.” It was all Jen said.<br/>
</p><p>“I rebought your food,” Rio told her. “I would like to apologise for my security throwing it away. I didn’t know they were going to do that.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen’s cold demeanour melted a little. “You didn’t?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>Jen nodded. “Well…thanks.”<br/>
</p><p>“De nada.”<br/>
</p><p>Their front door slammed shut, and voices sounded down the hall almost immediately after.<br/>
</p><p>“If you try to take what’s left of my Subway, I will shove it so far up your arse you’ll needed it surgically removed!”<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha’s back,” Jen smirked.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, for fucksake.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio heard her head of security mumble something before footsteps stomped down the hallway. Agatha appeared in the doorway, Subway not in hand. She also had a companion, a redhead who Rio assumed to be Wanda.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh! You’re here, good,” she was talking to Rio. “Can you tell you lap dog to give me back my fucking Subway? It’s already bad enough you threw away all my food.”<br/>
</p><p>“She replaced it,” Jen mumbled over a rice cake.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked. “She…what?”<br/>
</p><p>“Bought it all back,” Jen said from behind Rio.<br/>
</p><p>The brunette looked momentarily thrown off before she steeled herself. “Well, I would bloody well hope so. Now, about my Subway?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s head of security came into the kitchen then.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s all clear.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha all but snatched it out of his outstretched hand.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, is it?” Agatha replied sarcastically.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda, to try and ease the tension in the room, Rio supposed, said:<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…hi Princess Rio-Sofia. I’m Wanda. Alice has told me so much about you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “Nice to meet you, Wanda. And Rio’s just fine.”<br/>
</p><p>The redhead nodded.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio shifted her gaze to Agatha, the other girl was shooting daggers at her <em>again.<em> What the fuck had she done now? She’d bought back her food, she’d been able to keep her Subway, the kitchen was back to normal. What more did she want from her?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Before Rio had a chance to snatch at the anger rising in her chest, she spat out:<br/>
</p><p>“But you, on the other hand, can call me by my title.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Do you want me to fucking bow and curtsey too?”<br/>
</p><p>“Take your pick,” Rio smirked.<br/>
</p><p>“Okayy…” Jen and Alice said at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah…” Wanda added. “Not that this hasn’t been…fun…but I actually have to go.” The redhead leaned in and kissed Agatha once, regardless of the scowl on her face, before she left the room.<br/>
</p><p>A weird feeling shot through Rio at the sight.<br/>
</p><p>“You,” Jen pointed at Agatha. “You’re gonna help me make dinner, and you’re not to say a word to her.”<br/>
</p><p>“And you,” Alice said to Rio. “You’re going to do the same.”<br/>
</p><p>“They’re going to kill each other,” Rio heard Jen whisper to Alice.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>First and foremost, fuck Princess Rio-Sofia Vidal.<br/>
</p><p>But <em>fuck<em> did she look good in those grey baggy sweatpants and Calvin Klein sports bra. Agatha made a point to never look at her directly, but she was still in her peripheral vision when they’d all been in the kitchen. Jen had instructed her to help make her dinner, and Alice had told Rio-Sofia to do the same.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Whenever Agatha had caught sight of her, she hated to admit it but, Rio-Sofia looked hot. She didn’t know if it was the abs or the ponytail she’d put her hair in when she started helping Alice prepare a salad. To be honest, Agatha was surprised she even knew how to use a knife. Wasn’t she supposed to have royal chiefs or something?<br/>
</p><p>They also kept touching. On complete and utter accident, of course. Agatha wouldn’t touch the princess on purpose even if she was the last person on earth and they needed to hug to gather body heat, so they didn’t freeze to death.<br/>
</p><p>The touches would occur when they would reach into the same area at the same time, their bodies would brush past one another when they moved about the kitchen. Little stupid things like that.<br/>
</p><p>It was inevitable in the forced proximity, but it wasn’t bloody helpful that Agatha’s body would always buzz whenever they made contact. She chalked it down to being around an attractive woman whilst ovulating. It certainly had <em>nothing<em> to do with Rio-Sofia herself…<br/>
</em></em></p><p>…Because Agatha hated her.<br/>
</p><p>She was still the fake bitch who had kissed a girl and told the entire world that she regretted it and had brought shame on her family. She was still the princess who acted like she was above Agatha and could act however she wanted. She was still the worst flatmate Agatha could have ever asked for.<br/>
</p><p>After they’d made Jen’s dinner (a stir-fry), Agatha went to her room, grabbed everything she’d need for her lecture tomorrow along with some clothes, and headed over to Wanda’s. One, she’d seen enough of Rio-Sofia for one day, and two, she needed a fuck. She was still ovulating.<br/>
</p><p>Now, she was in her first official lecture of the year: <em>The introduction to Criminal Law.<br/>
</em></p><p>She’d sat in the middle of the lecture hall. She didn’t want to be at the front, the lecturer would be more likely to notice her, but she didn’t want to be at the back. The back said, ‘I don’t want to be here’ or ‘I’m scared to be here,' and Agatha was neither of those things.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled out her laptop and placed it on the bench in front of her. She reached back into her bag to grab her water bottle, and when she looked up, a boy was sitting next to her.<br/>
</p><p>“Er…”<br/>
</p><p>“Hi!” He said far too enthusiastically for nine in the morning. “I’m Billy! I’m so nervous. Is this your first time here?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stared at him.<br/>
</p><p>“No, of course it’s your first time here,” he answered his own question. “We’re both first years…or are you? You might be a second-year. How old are you?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had no idea why she answered the boy tweeting away like a baby bird, but she replied, “I’m twenty.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re twenty?!”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah.”<br/>
</p><p>“No, no…I mean…there’s nothing wrong with that. I’m eighteen.”<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t say?” Agatha replied dryly.<br/>
</p><p>“How comes you’re doing first-year now? Did you take two years off to go traveling? Where did you go? Thailand? Australia?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha flared her eyes. She did not need this. It was far too early in the morning to be asked so many questions, not that the child had let her answer any.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah…I’m gonna go sit over there…” she said, grabbing at her laptop.<br/>
</p><p>At the same time, a girl slid onto the bench on the other side of her, trapping her in. She turned to ask the girl to get out of the way when her eyes locked onto deep brown.<br/>
</p><p>“Mierda.” <em>Shit.<br/>
</em></p><p>“Are you fucking kidding me?” Agatha groaned. “Are you stalking me? This feels like stalking.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia scoffed. “Trust me. I don’t want to be here either.”<br/>
</p><p>“Then leave,” Agatha shot back.<br/>
</p><p>A gasp from behind her momentarily pulled her attention away from the princess.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re Princess Rio-Sofia!” The teenager whisper yelled. “And you’re in <em>my<em> lecture on criminal law? This is the greatest day of my life.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio-Sofia scrunched her face and glanced at Agatha, who only rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry,” the boy said. “I just know an egregious amount about you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Thanks?” Rio-Sofia replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Right,” Agatha clapped. “Now that you two have found each other…I’m gonna go.”<br/>
</p><p>She started picking up her belongings before their lecturer strutted onto the lecture stage.<br/>
</p><p>“Seats, everyone, please,” Professor Lilia Calderu told the hall.<br/>
</p><p>Yeah, no. Agatha was not about to spend the next two hours trapped in between a child and a bitchy Spanish princess. She started shuffling along the row, whacking at Rio-Sofia’s knees to get her to move them.<br/>
</p><p>“You there,” Professor Calderu called.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked up and realised her Professor was pointing at her.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s your name, dear?”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, for fucksake.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Agatha, but could you please take your seat? I want to start my lecture,” Professor Calderu smiled.<br/>
</p><p>She heard Rio-Sofia snigger.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Snobby bitch.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha dropped back into her previous seat with a huff, placing her laptop back on the bench.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh my god. If that happened to me, I’d be so embarrassed,” the little boy rambled. “Are you embarrassed? It’s okay if you are.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” the bratty princess chimed in. “Are you? It’s okay if you are,” she echoed and mocked the teenager's words.<br/>
</p><p>Now, Agatha really was contemplating poisoning Rio-Sofia’s food. How the fuck she had found this girl attractive last night she didn’t know.<br/>
</p><p>“If one of you so much as utters another word to me, I’m screaming then blaming it on you. Are we clear?”<br/>
</p><p>The teenage boy nodded far too many times, and Rio-Sofia scoffed.<br/>
</p><p>“Alright, class, I’m Professor Lilia Calderu. Welcome to criminal law.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Professor Calderu had finally allowed them to have a twenty-minute break. In between trying to focus on the lecture and type down notes, Agatha also had to endure the teenager she was sitting next to whispering questions to his favourite princess. Agatha knew Rio-Sofia had no interest in talking to the boy, but she was entertaining it because she knew it was pissing her off.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia was like a leech. Stuck to her everywhere she went, even when she’d tried to rip it off. She was in her flat, on her course, what was next? Was Rio-Sofia going to join the hockey team?<br/>
</p><p>“There’s my favourite lawyer,” a familiar voice said from behind where Agatha was filling up her water bottle at the water fountain.<br/>
</p><p>She rolled her eyes playfully. “I’m not a lawyer yet, Wanda.”<br/>
</p><p>“But you will be,” the ginger smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Today, Agatha was at the Waterloo campus, which is where Wanda had classes sometimes as well. Wanda did Pharmacology.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled Agatha in by the belt loop of her black baggy jeans. “How’s Calderu?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wrapped her free arm around Wanda’s waist. “She’s alright, a bit…kooky.”<br/>
</p><p>“Kooky?” Wanda echoed with a laugh. “That’s a new one. I’ve only heard wispy. How come?”<br/>
</p><p>“Well,” Wanda put a hand on her hip and stepped closer. “She keeps randomly spouting out facts that have no relation to what we’re talking about, and then she acts like it never happened. Maybe she has dementia?”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, yeah?” Wanda hummed, although it didn’t sound like she’d been listening.<br/>
</p><p>And she hadn’t. She’d just been staring at Agatha’s lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you even listening?” Agatha scolded.<br/>
</p><p>“I am, yes,” Wanda said before kissing her.<br/>
</p><p>A man’s voice interrupted them.<br/>
</p><p>“So, this is the first year you’ve been fucking?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned to see a man with a pathetic excuse for a beard, pasty skin and stringy hair. She thought she recognised him.<br/>
</p><p>She did.<br/>
</p><p>“Ralph?”<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha?”<br/>
</p><p>Ralph Bohner, the boy she’d kissed at fourteen and immediately thrown up afterwards.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you doing here?”<br/>
</p><p>“You two know each other?” Wanda asked at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>“What do you think I’m doing here?” Agatha shot back. “And yeah, we know each other from home. How do you know each other?”<br/>
</p><p>“Ralph’s on the men’s hockey team.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. “He is? How’s he done that then?”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda sniggered, burying her head in Agatha’s shoulder to try and conceal it.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve improved a lot, Agatha, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>“Who are you trying to convince, you or me?” She replied.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda laughed again.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha!” The little boy shouted. “We’re going back in, come on.” He was standing next to Rio-Sofia and her head of security. She had her arms folded; her face twisted into an expression of disgust.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>The fuck is her problem?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Who is-?”<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t ask,” Agatha cut her off. “I gotta go,” she gave Wanda a quick peck.<br/>
</p><p>“That was really hot,” Ralph commented.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate before stamping on his foot. “Don’t be a fucking perv,” she told him before shoving him out of the way. “And you,” she stormed over to where Rio-Sofia was standing by the lecture hall door, “Keep glaring at me like that and your face will get stuck like that.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia scoffed. “Says fucking you.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio hadn’t paid attention for the entire: <em>The introduction to Criminal Law<em> lecture. She didn’t care. She didn’t want to be a lawyer; she didn’t even want to go to university. And if she had done, she’d be studying biology. But her mother had said, ‘What is a princess going to do with biology?’<br/>
</em></em></p><p>‘What was a princess going to do with a law degree?’ Rio wanted to say back.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, and to make matters worse, her flatmate from hell was on the same course as her. She’d accidentally sat next to her; she’d just seen a pretty head of hair and been drawn to it like a magnet. She cursed herself for not putting two and two together…not that Agatha had a pretty head of hair…<br/>
</p><p>She’d been forced to endure two hours of questioning from some random boy with black curly hair that had stuck to her like glue even in the break. And then Wanda had appeared, and that weird feeling spread through Rio’s body again. She tried to ignore it, but every time she looked in their direction and Wanda was grabbing onto Agatha in some way, the feeling only got worse.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was just glad she had no more classes today. Her nine to eleven was over and done with, and she could head back to the flat…where Agatha would be. Actually, no. Change of plans.<br/>
</p><p>“Hola, Luis,” Rio said to her driver as she got into her car. “¿Puedes llevarme a-?” <em>Can you take me to a-<br/>
</em></p><p>“No, princesa,” her head of security, Juan, cut her off.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Por qué?”<br/>
</p><p>“Órdenes de la reina, princesa.” <em>Orders from the queen, princess.<br/>
</em></p><p>Well, that didn’t make any sense. The last time Rio checked (which was literally yesterday), she was allowed to go places as long as she was driven there.<br/>
</p><p>“Nosotras tenemos que llevarte a casa.” <em>We have to take you home.<br/>
</em></p><p>Like hell they were. Rio pulled her phone out of her jeans back pocket and rang the palace.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>It turns out, her mother had changed the rules without telling. She had to earn the privilege to go places other than university and her accommodation. To do this, she had to call her mother once a day, send over the notes she’d been taking, and recite extracts of the reading she was doing in voice notes to prove that she was actually paying attention in her lectures.<br/>
</p><p>She was, however, allowed to join one society. That was her only ticket to freedom. Her father had persuaded the queen to allow Rio to choose which society she wanted to join. Which meant she didn’t have to join the catholic society.<br/>
</p><p>For once, she was grateful for her father. He’d actually stuck up for her.<br/>
</p><p>The question was…which society? Alice had offered her a place on the hockey team, but Rio didn’t know if she enjoyed hockey enough to waste her one pick on it. She’d much rather play netball.<br/>
</p><p>Juan let her into the flat because, yet again, to him, Rio’s hands weren’t capable of opening doors on her own. She heard Alice and Jen in the kitchen and headed straight for it.<br/>
</p><p>“Hola, Rio,” Alice said when she saw her.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, Rio-Sofia,” Jen added<br/>
</p><p>“Hola, chicas,” Rio replied, dumping her bag on the floor and climbing onto one of the chairs around the kitchen island.<br/>
</p><p>“So…you two speak fluent English and Spanish?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” Alice nodded. “Ri can also speak six languages.”<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Five<em> I can only speak a little Italian,” Rio corrected.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“That’s still more than me,” Jen said. “Did you learn that at school or…?”<br/>
</p><p>“I had tutors. And before Alice started learning English at school, I would teach her by forcing her to watch American movies with me.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice smiled. “We’d always do impressions of those…what were they called…?”<br/>
</p><p>“Valley Girls?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>Alice snapped her fingers. “That’s it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed before she asked, “What societies do they have at KCL?”<br/>
</p><p>“Why?”<br/>
</p><p>“Because I want to join one. My mother won’t let me leave the flat otherwise.”<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t want to join the hockey team? You’re already in.”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t think-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio got cut off when their front door opened and closed, and laughter trickled down the corridor until Wanda and Agatha appeared in the kitchen<br/>
</p><p>“Good day, ladies,” Wanda greeted.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, look whose home,” Jen said to her best friend. “Are you allergic to this flat or something?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled a face. “No.”<br/>
</p><p>“You sure?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha flipped her off.<br/>
</p><p>“Before I forget,” Alice said. “Congrats, Agatha! You made it into the KCL hockey team!”<br/>
</p><p>Everyone, apart from Rio, clapped at the news.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you…aren’t we supposed to find out next week, though?”<br/>
</p><p>Alice tilted her head back and forth. “Technically yes, but we’re friends now and we live together.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Isn’t that an abuse of power?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio had said that.<br/>
</p><p>Alice shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“So we’re all on the hockey team then?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “You’re on the hockey team?” She was talking to Rio.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t want to waste her one pick on the hockey society. “Yes, I am.” Rio didn't know why she’d said that.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, perfect!” Alice exclaimed. “We need you in defence.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Al, do you know what this means?” Wanda grinned. “We’ve got three freshers who need to go through the initiation process.”<br/>
</p><p>“What the hell is that?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>“I’d also like to know,” Rio added.<br/>
</p><p>“Good luck trying to get either of them to tell you,” Agatha chimed in. “They haven’t told me shit.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice waved a hand dismissively. “It’s fine, just a bit of fun.”<br/>
</p><p>“So…we’re all fucked,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>Alice and Wanda only grinned further.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It was the following Tuesday. The first official hockey practice of the year.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was in an…okay mood (she was fucking fuming).<br/>
</p><p>Her first two weeks at university had been everything she could’ve asked for (with the exception of Rio-Sofia). She was enjoying her course and keeping up to date with all the content, she was getting drunk regularly, she had someone she could fuck regularly, as well as other women she could fuck on occasion, she’d made it on to the hockey team, and she lived with her best friend in London of all places.<br/>
</p><p>Everything was perfect…until her mother called before hockey practice:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Why haven’t you called me?” Her mother asked when she answered the phone.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha was midway through lacing up her astros.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I didn’t think you’d want me to?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Why would you think that?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Oh…I don’t know because you hate me, because you told me having me was the worst thing that had ever happened to you, because you told me I would be on my own when I went to university.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Agatha?” Her mother asked when she hadn’t replied.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Yes?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Answer me when I speak to you!” Her mother shrieked.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Sorry, mother.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“This is so typical of you. I’ve looked after you your entire life.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>It’s almost as if that’s what you’re supposed to do.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“I fed you, watered you, put clothes on your back.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Why is she talking like I’m a fucking plant?<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And this is how you repay me? By not calling? Why did I buy you a phone then?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>You didn’t, I did.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Well?!” Her mother yelled when she hadn’t replied yet again.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>She could hang up right now. Her mother wouldn’t be able to do anything about it.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Sorry, mother,” Agatha answered instead.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Evanora scoffed. “Ridiculous. You need god. He is the only one who can save your diseased soul. You disgust me, and you shall rot in hell.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her mother hung up the phone.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>So yeah…understandable…Agatha was in a foul mood.<br/>
</p><p>“You, okay?” Jen asked whilst they were in the dugout putting on their shin pads.<br/>
</p><p>“Peachy,” Agatha replied flatly.<br/>
</p><p>Her best friend frowned. “What’s up, Aggs?”<br/>
</p><p>“My mother.”<br/>
</p><p>And that was all Jen needed to understand. “I’m sorry, babe.”<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t be,” Agatha replied before she snatched up her hockey stick and made her way over to the rest of the girls in the centre of the astro turf.<br/>
</p><p>She stood in the space between Wanda and Monica. They both smiled at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, ladies,” Alice clapped. “Today we’re starting with something easy…ten laps around the pitch.”<br/>
</p><p>The group of girls groaned.<br/>
</p><p>“Groan and we’ll make it twenty,” Natasha said.<br/>
</p><p>Nobody made a sound.<br/>
</p><p>“Good. Drop your sticks and get on with it.”<br/>
</p><p>They did.<br/>
</p><p>Today, Agatha welcomed the run. Running would take her mind off her mother. At first, she ran with the group of seventy-odd girls, taking up a comfortable spot in the middle. Soon, she found the pace was too slow, it wasn’t making her lungs burn like she wanted them to. She picked up her pace.<br/>
</p><p>By lap three, she was in fifth place, by lap seven, she was at the front…way at the front. She could no longer hear the pitter-patter of footsteps behind her…until lap eight. And, because who else would it be, Rio-Sofia was running alongside her.<br/>
</p><p>She tried to ignore her at first, but when Rio-Sofia began to overtake her, Agatha simply couldn't let that happen. She elongated her strides so that she’d cover more ground, and once again she was at the front of the pack. Until Rio-Sofia copied her.<br/>
</p><p>Was she fucking serious?<br/>
</p><p>They were on lap ten now, stuck in the same cycle. Agatha would take up the lead, Rio-Sofia would overtake her and so on. Agatha was not prepared to lose to the princess, so, as they came up to the end of their lap, she pushed off the astro with more force than she thought she’d ever had. She pumped her arms twice as hard, stretched her strides as far as possible, and she won.<br/>
</p><p>When she was done, she hunched over, resting her hands on her knees, gulping in air. Her lungs burned, her throat was dry, and she felt like she was about to throw up.<br/>
</p><p>It was perfect. Just what she’d needed.<br/>
</p><p>“Impressive, Agatha,” Alice called from the centre of the pitch. “What position do you play again?”<br/>
</p><p>“Left…forward,” she panted.<br/>
</p><p>“Brilliant,” Alice replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Alright, girls, grab a drink,” Natasha said as the other women joined them at the end of the pitch. “Then we’re gonna do some stretching before we do some drills.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha started walking over to the dugout.<br/>
</p><p>“Wow,” Jen said, jogging to catch up with her. “I’ve never seen you run that fast.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>Once they’d reached the dugout, she squirted her water bottle into her mouth before spraying it on her face to cool it down.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey!” Jen scolded when the residue splashed on her. She turned her water bottle around and sprayed Agatha with it.<br/>
</p><p>“It didn’t do it on purpose!” Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>After stretching, Natasha told the girls to get into pairs for passing practice. They were to do twenty push passes, long passes, and slap passes.<br/>
</p><p>Before Agatha could ask, Darcy had partnered up with Jen.<br/>
</p><p>“Wanna be my partner?” That familiar voice asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned to a smiling Wanda. “Well, I wouldn’t want anyone else to-”<br/>
</p><p>“Oi!” Natasha yelled, cutting her off. “Ginger, you’re with me like you told me you’d be.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes. “Why do you remember that?”<br/>
</p><p>“Because I asked you this morning? I need you to help me demonstrate to the social members who haven’t played before.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda groaned. “Sorry, Agatha.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re good,” Agatha replied before Wanda ran off to join Natasha on the other pitch.<br/>
</p><p>She turned back to the girls on her pitch. Everyone was partnered up except for one person.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No. There is no way in hell I’m going to-<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“You two,” Alice yelled from the other end of the pitch. She waved a finger between Agatha and Rio-Sofia. “Grab a ball and partner up.”<br/>
</p><p>“Bloody brilliant,” Agatha muttered to herself as she walked to the ball bag.<br/>
</p><p>Jen produced a regretful smile as she passed.<br/>
</p><p>And yeah, her best friend should feel bad for not picking her to be her partner and making her pair up with the bitchy princess herself.<br/>
</p><p>The pair reached into the ball bag at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glared at her. “We only need one ball.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah? And I was going to get it for us.”<br/>
</p><p>“Even though I got here first?” Agatha shot back.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia scoffed before backing away from the bag, her hands up in mock surrender.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha retrieved a hockey ball before walking further onto the pitch, leaving Rio-Sofia to trail behind her.<br/>
</p><p>She found a space beside Jen and waited for Rio-Sofia to take up the position opposite her, next to Dacy. Agatha began passing the ball to her.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t want to say it, but Rio-Sofia was good. She passed the ball back and forth with precise ease. Each pass was delivered to the end of her stick with the same force. She never had to reach to receive the ball like so many of their peers.<br/>
</p><p>“Ow!” Jen shrieked when a rouge ball hit her foot.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry,” a girl replied meekly down the other end of the pitch. “My bad!”<br/>
</p><p>Jen huffed.<br/>
</p><p>“Maybe that’s your sign you shouldn’t be on the pitch,” Agatha teased. “Are you even good enough to be on the team, Jennifer? You never did show up for tryouts.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen produced her a fake smile before flipping her off. Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Alright, spread out!” Alice instructed once the first drill was over. “On to long passes.”<br/>
</p><p>Again, Rio-Sofia demonstrated that she was a good player. Her passes just as accurate and strong.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re good,” Darcy told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio-Sofia replied with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. She wasn’t <em>that<em> good.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>They moved on to slap passes, spreading out even further.<br/>
</p><p>“You, okay?” Agatha asked with a laugh after she’d smacked the ball to Rio-Sofia. “That ball hit you ten minutes ago.”<br/>
</p><p>Her best friend, the melodramatic theatric that she was, was hobbling around on one foot.<br/>
</p><p>“It hurts,” Jen groaned.<br/>
</p><p>“Duh, it’s a hockey ball,” Agatha laughed. “Do you need an ice pack?” She frowned mockingly.<br/>
</p><p>Just then, a hockey ball whacked Agatha in the foot.<br/>
</p><p>“Ow!” she yelped. Pain shot through her right foot as she held on to it. “What the fuck?!”<br/>
</p><p>“And if you hadn’t been mocking me, I would’ve warned you,” Jen smirked.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry!” Rio-Sofia called from the other side of the pitch. “I thought you were paying attention.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw her hockey stick down and threw both her hands up. “What about me talking to Jen indicates that I was paying attention?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia jerked her head back. “You’ve been talking to Jen this whole time, and you’ve always caught the ball.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>For fucksake, why has she made a good point?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha snatched up her hockey stick again, not caring that small pieces of gravel had gone into her fingernails. She rolled the ball onto her stick side and took a step back before smacking the ball in Rio-Sofia’s direction. Small pieces of gravel left the ground as she did so. The ball took flight, sailing towards Rio-Sofia. She ducked out of the way before it hit her.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you serious?!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha only shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia stormed over to the sideline to retrieve the ball, pushing it out before she side-stepped and hit it with the flat of her stick. The ball took flight again, although Agatha didn’t duck. She tapped the ball midair, and it dropped to the floor with a thud.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey!” Alice called from down the pitch. “We’re playing hockey, not tennis! If you want the balls in the air, join the tennis society. Take a water break.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at Rio-Sofia again, just grabbed her best friend and tugged her into the dugout.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m gonna kill her,” Agatha muttered as she sat down on the bench, taking off her shoe to assess the damage.<br/>
</p><p>“What’d I tell you about the Spanish government watch list?” Jen replied.<br/>
</p><p>“And didn’t I tell you I didn’t give a flying fuck?”<br/>
</p><p>Her foot was fine, but there would definitely be a bruise.<br/>
</p><p>“Just stay away from her from now on,” Jen told her. “How’s your foot?”<br/>
</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha replied flatly.<br/>
</p><p>All that rage from when she’d spoken to her mother was back at full force. She knew she wasn’t actually mad at Rio-Sofia, but she needed to be mad at <em>something.<br/>
</em></p><p>“And I’m alright too, thanks for asking.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply, too pissed off to speak.<br/>
</p><p>Now, to Agatha’s gratitude, they were playing a match.<br/>
</p><p>She’d flat-out told Alice she wouldn’t be putting on one of the red bibs that smelled like they hadn’t been washed in years, and she’d ended up the captain of the non-bib team. Jen and Wanda out among the girls she knew were on it.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia was the captain of the bib team with Darcy, Monica and Gamora. Natasha and Alice were the referees.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, girls, we want a clean game,” Natasha said in the centre of the pitch in between the two centres.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s team had the ball first.<br/>
</p><p>She shoved her gumshield into her mouth just before Natasha blew the whistle and the game began.<br/>
</p><p>Jen, their centre midfielder, pushed passed the ball on to Agatha’s non-stick side. She caught it on her reverse stick, manoeuvring the ball with a one-two tap on either side to get it on her stick side before she shot forward, dribbling the ball at a steady pace.<br/>
</p><p>She looked up and saw that her centre forward was free just ahead of her. She passed the ball with one smooth push of her stick. Their centre forward caught it and advanced further towards the goal. </p><p>Without the ball, Agatha could run faster. She sprinted into the D.<br/>
</p><p>Their centre forward had done a shabby pass to Wanda (right forward), and Gamora, Rio-Sofia’s left defender, intercepted the pass, slapping the ball back down the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>“For fucksake,” Agatha mumbled around her gumshield. She pushed back, exiting the D.<br/>
</p><p>There had been multiple tackles and a close call on Agatha’s team's target before she received the ball again. Now in a better position than before, she dribbled the ball in a curve down their attacking half before entering the D on the left-hand side.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia appeared in front of her. She did a dummy pass, dragging the ball to one side before pulling it back to the other. It made Rio-Sofia lunge left, freeing up Agatha’s right side so now she had a clear channel to the goal.<br/>
</p><p>She ran forward, only the goalie in her way, and slap shot the ball into the corner of the goal.<br/>
</p><p>“One-nil!” Alice yelled from the sideline.<br/>
</p><p>Her team cheered. Agatha walked past a scowling Rio-Sofia with a smirk.<br/>
</p><p>The game was a close one. Neither team ever having more than a one-goal difference. Alice and Natasha had really lucked out with this group of girls. They were all talented, all knew the craft of the sport. The 2024-25 KCL hockey team were going to be a top contender when they played against other universities. Agatha could feel it.<br/>
</p><p>However, as the game had progressed, so had Rio-Sofia’s insight into how Agatha played. She hadn’t fallen for Agatha’s mock pass again; she’d met Agatha every time she’d received the ball so that she’d been forced to pass it as soon as she’d caught it, and her tackles had gotten more forceful.<br/>
</p><p>It was grinding on Agatha's gears. Just like at university and in their home, Agatha couldn’t shake her. Rio-Sofia had stuck to her like glue. The two girls had shoved each other more than once. It was nothing worth getting blown up for, but Natasha and Alice had issued them multiple warnings.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had the ball once again, and once again Rio-Sofia was on her ass. She decided to run straight through her. She pushed forward, forcing Rio-Sofia back towards her D. Agatha had made it to the top of it before Rio-Sofia planted her feet in the ground and surged forward.<br/>
</p><p>Their sticks collided with a harsh slap that rang out across the field. They both stooped in squatting positions as the ball was squeezed in between their hockey sticks. Agatha’s arm began to burn as Rio-Sofia forced her entire body weight into her hockey stick. Agatha did the same, the ball locked in a stalemate with nowhere to go.<br/>
</p><p>She felt Alice run up behind them to referee the tackle.<br/>
</p><p>It was as if time had stopped, and it was just her and Rio-Sofia. They were trapped in this moment, each trying to win the ball.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t take her eyes off it, pushing forward to win.<br/>
</p><p>It wasn’t until Rio-Sofia stepped back that Agatha moved again. No longer being held up by Rio-Sofia pushing back, she tumbled forward, landing on the astro turf with a splat. The ball smashed against her rib from where it had been left.<br/>
</p><p>Pain shot through her instantly and Agatha saw fucking red.<br/>
</p><p>She shot up from the ground and pushed Rio-Sofia with all her might.<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck is your problem?!”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Calm down.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She pushed her again. “Did you think that was funny?”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Stop it.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“We were in a stalemate! The ball wasn’t going anywhere, so I took a step back. It wasn’t my fault you ended up on the floor.”<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, girls. Let’s calm down,” Alice tried to reason as Agatha lunged forward again.<br/>
</p><p>She felt hands grab underneath her arms, felt her feet being lifted off the ground.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey!” Rio-Sofia shouted, surging forward. “Don’t touch her! Put her down! ¡Déjala! ¡Déjala!” <em>Let her go! Let her go!<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio-Sofia’s head of security had yanked Agatha up.<br/>
</p><p>“Ella te estaba haciendo daño, princesa.” <em>She was hurting you, princess,<em> Agatha translated in her head as her feet dangled in the air.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“¡No, no me hacía daño!” <em>No, it wasn't hurting me!<em> Rio-Sofia shrieked.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The other girls had surrounded them then, hitting and smacking at Rio-Sofia’s head of security with their hockey sticks like he was a piñata as they, too, yelled at him to put Agatha down.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha almost smiled, talk about team spirit.<br/>
</p><p>“Put her fucking down!” Rio ordered.<br/>
</p><p>Her bodyguard reluctantly did so.<br/>
</p><p>Jen dragged her away from him almost immediately.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re going,” Rio-Sofia told him. “Get my stuff.”<br/>
</p><p>She left the pitch without another word.</p>

<p>Following orders, that’s what Rio was doing.<br/>
</p><p>She’d told the entire world she regretted something she didn’t because the queen told her to, she was in London going to a university, taking a course she had no interest in because the queen told her to, she hadn’t left the flat except to go to class or hockey practice because the queen <em>told her to.<br/>
</em></p><p>And her security, they were only following orders, too.<br/>
</p><p>They’d reorganised the entire kitchen and thrown away her flatmates food making an awful first impression because of direct orders from the queen, her head of security Juan was by her side everywhere she went because of direct orders from the queen, her head of security Juan had also manhandled Agatha…because of direct orders from the queen…?<br/>
</p><p>Yeah, no. That was crossing the fucking line.<br/>
</p><p>His job was to keep an eye on and protect her; she got that much, but she most certainly did not need protection from a twenty-year-old girl around her strength and physique.<br/>
</p><p>She rang the palace as soon as she got home, that Spanish that she missed speaking consistently flowing out of her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“Hello, mother.”<br/>
</p><p>“Hello, Rio-Sofia. How was hockey practice?” The queen asked.<br/>
</p><p>“It was good.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m glad you and Alice are on the same team again. It had been many years.”<br/>
</p><p>Her mother loved Alice. Her best friend was intelligent, kind and a ferocious leader. Sometimes Rio felt that the queen liked Alice more than her. She often wondered if her mother could, would she trade her for Alice? Maybe then she’d have the perfect daughter she’d always wanted…or…almost perfect. Alice was still gay.<br/>
</p><p>“Me too,” Rio answered.<br/>
</p><p>“What can I do for you, Rio-Sofia? We’ve already spoken today. I know you’re up to date with all your content.”<br/>
</p><p>“My head of security, Juan…can I change him, please?”<br/>
</p><p>There was a pause before the queen said, “Why would I do that?”<br/>
</p><p>Where to fucking start.<br/>
</p><p>“I didn’t like the way he handled another girl on my hockey team today. He grabbed her-”<br/>
</p><p>Her mother cut her off. “If he did that means he thought she was a threat. What was she doing?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing,” she lied. “We were tackling for the ball, we were shoving each other, and he grabbed her. But it wasn’t nice, mother. He’d lifted her so high in the air, and he was squeezing her with far too much force. My hockey team aren’t a threat, and she already hates me enough,” Rio quietly admitted.<br/>
</p><p>She understood why Agatha hated her; she really did. She was some princess who had rocked up and appeared to have told her security to throw away all their food and dismantle their kitchen. And it hadn’t even been Rio’s idea to buy it all back. At the time, she’d been so caught up in the way Agatha had spoken to her, <em>looked<em> at her as if she were the most vile creature on the planet, that had made her focus on the wrong things.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>After that, it had just stuck. Agatha would look at her like she was the dirt on the bottom of her shoe, and Rio would act like a full-out princess to hide the fact that it <em>hurt<em> for this random girl to look at her with her beautiful blue eyes, only for them to be filled with hatred.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Hm,” the queen hummed. “I’m not sure that’s a good enough reason.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio suppressed the urge to scoff. “Please, mother. I have done everything you have asked of me, and I have not asked you for anything but this since I’ve been here. I would like the girls to feel comfortable around me, and they won’t if they are in fear of a seven-foot man manhandling them at any given moment.”<br/>
</p><p>There was another pause as the queen considered. “Very well.” And it was all she said.<br/>
</p><p>Rio would not go into detail about her ideal replacement, just grateful her mother was listening to her at all. “Thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Goodbye, Rio-Sofia. And remember-”<br/>
</p><p>“One foot out of line and I shall be sent somewhere far worse,” Rio finished her sentence. “I understand, mother. Goodbye.”<br/>
</p><p>The queen hung up the phone.<br/>
</p><p>Rio flopped onto her bed with a sigh, it was part relief, part exhaustion.<br/>
</p><p>She needed a shower. She was still in her sweaty hockey kit. She did just that, stripping off her clothes and making her way into her bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>After washing her hair and scrubbing herself raw, she changed into a grey <em>Calvin Klein<em> bralette and black sweatpants before turning on her fan. She didn’t know what it was about university dorms why they were always so hot.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio climbed into bed, ready to put in her AirPods and listen to music, when her phone rang. She smiled when she saw the caller ID.<br/>
</p><p>“You finally remembered I existed, huh?” Rio teased.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos laughed. “It’s been a busy week, Rio-Sofia.”<br/>
</p><p>She groaned, and her brother laughed once again because he knew how much she hated her full name.<br/>
</p><p>“How are you doing? How’s London?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m miserable and I don’t actually know how London is, considering mother won’t let me see any of it.”<br/>
</p><p>There was a pause before Carlos said, “What do you mean?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows. “What do you mean, what do I mean?”<br/>
</p><p>“Mother said you were loving London, that you were the happiest you’ve been in months.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed because of course she fucking had.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s not true?” Carlos asked, his voice stern.<br/>
</p><p>“Nope. I’m only allowed to leave the house unless it’s for class or hockey practice.”<br/>
</p><p>Her brother muttered a string of curse words. “I am so sorry, Rio. I had no idea.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio found herself laughing. “Don’t be, it’s not your fault.”<br/>
</p><p>“I know, but if I had called earlier or answered your texts, I would’ve known.”<br/>
</p><p>She sighed. “It’s not like you can do anything about it, Carlos. I’m still here and you’re still in Spain.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Spain.<em> How she missed it.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“How’s Ana?” Rio asked because she didn’t want to think about how homesick she was.<br/>
</p><p>“She misses you,” her brother replied.<br/>
</p><p>“I miss her too. Hopefully, I can FaceTime her on the weekend.”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos had gone quiet on the other end.<br/>
</p><p>“Carlos?”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t want you to feel ashamed about what you did.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked; the conversation had taken a complete one-eighty.<br/>
</p><p>“Mother wants to make it so you feel so, by sending you off to London, by trapping you there. She wants you to associate the feelings you have now, the isolation, the lack of freedom, the frustration…with how you feel about women. It’s so that you won’t want to do it again because you’ll remember how you felt the last time you did.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched. She wasn’t sure she was ready for this conversation.<br/>
</p><p>“But you can’t let her stop you from liking who you like, Rio. You have nothing to be ashamed of, and just know that Ana and I support you and whoever you choose to love. I know it probably isn’t the same as having mami and papá’s support. But you will always have us, your siblings.”<br/>
</p><p>She hastily wiped at a tear that fell. She hadn’t realised how much she needed to hear that. She hadn’t realised how lonely she’d truly felt. Although she had Alice, her best friend was free to do whatever she wanted, and Rio would never ask her to waste away her second year in their flat to keep her company.<br/>
</p><p>It had just been Rio trapped inside the four walls of her dorm room for a little over a week now.<br/>
</p><p>“I love you, thank you for that,” she told her brother.<br/>
</p><p>“I love you, too,” Carlos replied. “And so does Ana,” he added.<br/>
</p><p>She laughed as she wiped more tears from her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“I unfortunately have to go now, Rio. But I shall speak to you very soon.”<br/>
</p><p>“Bye, Carlos.”<br/>
</p><p>“Bye,” he replied.<br/>
</p><p>Rio hung up the phone, cried some more, and fell asleep.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked awake. She didn’t remember falling asleep. She pushed her damp hair out of her face and sat up, patting her bed down to find her phone. When she found it, she clicked it on to check the time. It was ten past midnight.<br/>
</p><p>What the hell? She’d slept for five hours?<br/>
</p><p>She rolled out her neck and realised she was parched. Her hand found the light switch above her headboard and turned it on. Rio groaned when she picked up her water bottle off her bedside table and realised it was empty.<br/>
</p><p>Sluggishly, she climbed out of bed, put on her slippers and made her way to the kitchen. Juan was gone. Unsurprising, she guessed. It was midnight, and he also needed sleep. One of her other bodyguards would be outside the flat door.<br/>
</p><p>What sounded like cutlery tapping against China sounded from the kitchen as she made her way towards it. Rio passed through the open kitchen door, and blue eyes locked onto her in the dim lighting.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was sitting on one of the chairs around the island, stirring a mug of what smelled like English breakfast tea.<br/>
</p><p>Rio found herself swallowing when the other girl narrowed her eyes slightly.<br/>
</p><p>The grip around her water bottle tightened before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“I’m…I’m sorry about earlier. About Juan. He shouldn’t have touched you like that.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed before turning her attention to the other mug in front of her. She stirred that one too.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m getting a new head of security. You won’t have to see him again.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha said nothing.<br/>
</p><p>Rio tried not to let the lack of response get to her, tried not to let the evident hatred in Agatha’s eyes bother her like it had the last time. Agatha didn’t owe her anything.<br/>
</p><p>She nodded before opening the fridge to retrieve her water jug. She placed it on the island a little away from where the other girl sat and began filling up her forest green water bottle.<br/>
</p><p>The two sat in an intense silence before Agatha spoke:<br/>
</p><p>“Can I ask you a question?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked. What would Agatha possibly want to ask her?<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah?”<br/>
</p><p>“Why did you say that stuff?”<br/>
</p><p>She furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“I watched that video of you, the one from three months ago, after that paparazzi caught you kissing that girl.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows further. Agatha knew about that?<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Well, why wouldn’t she? The whole world knows about it.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Do you know how many queer women you could’ve helped? To have a princess be out and loud about it. They would see you, someone so in the public eye and know that it would be okay for them to be out and loud about it too.” The more she spoke, the more her irritation grew.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t know what to say. It wasn’t like she didn’t <em>want<em> to be out and loud about it. She simply wasn’t allowed to be.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I had to do what was best for my family,” she spoke her mother’s words.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed again. “Why? Because Spain would turn on you?”<br/>
</p><p>Maybe. Rio didn’t know.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you even like women?” Agatha asked. “Or are you just straight, bored and looking for attention?”<br/>
</p><p>Now that hurt.<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t know what you’re talking about,” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t I?”<br/>
</p><p>“No! You don’t,” Rio replied, irritation lacing her own voice. <em>I was following orders;<em> she wanted to say.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Oh, so you didn’t say, and I quote, ‘It was the biggest regret of my life.’”<br/>
</p><p>Rio closed her eyes to keep the rush of memories at bay. The lies, the shame she felt for not sticking up for herself, for not telling her mother that she wouldn’t say that speech because she didn’t believe a word of it.<br/>
</p><p>When she opened her eyes, Agatha was glaring at her again, those blue eyes filled with so much hate…and desperation? Or maybe Rio was seeing things.<br/>
</p><p>“Is that why you hate me?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pushed back her chair and got up. “Amongst other things.”<br/>
</p><p>And it all made sense now.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha put her dirty spoon in the sink, retrieved her two mugs of tea, and left the room without another word.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wanted to chase after her, tell her:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I didn’t want to say any of those things. I didn’t mean any of it. I’m not straight, I’m a lesbian, and I wanted nothing more than to claim to be.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She didn’t, just put her water jug back into the fridge and returned to her room.<br/>
</p><p>Rio gulped down her water, brushed her teeth and flopped into bed. She wanted to go home.<br/>
</p><p>“How so, darlin?” Rio heard from the other side of the wall. That voice that had been so harsh moments before was soft and gentle.<br/>
</p><p>She heard Wanda mumble something before the two broke out into a fit of giggles. Agatha hushed her, reminding her that the walls were thin.<br/>
</p><p>That horrible feeling climbed up Rio’s stomach again because why couldn't Agatha speak to her that way? Her charming British accent used to speak to her sweetly instead of always snapping or biting at her.<br/>
</p><p>She wished she could tell Agatha the truth, but she knew she couldn’t. Their relationship was set in stone. Agatha hated her, and Rio had to pretend she hated her too.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>There was a knock at the door. “¿Princesa?”<br/>
</p><p>That voice, Rio didn’t recognise it.<br/>
</p><p>She rubbed the sleet from her eyes and reluctantly got up out of bed to open the door. Now, standing before her was a woman in a black pantsuit. Her jet black hair was tied up in a ponytail, and her green eyes were looking at her as if she couldn’t believe Rio was standing in front of her. The woman was young, only a couple of years older than her, if she had to guess.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, I’m Lucia, your new head of security.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked at her. <em>This<em> was her new head of security? How? By the grace of whom? Her mother would never let someone this young take control of her security team.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Hi, I’m Rio,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“I know, princesa,” Lucia replied with a smile. “You have a nine-to-eleven you need to be ready for. Would you like to get dressed?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, still not completely understanding what was happening.<br/>
</p><p>“After that, you are getting coffee with Alice, so wear something cute,” Lucia winked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. “That must be a mistake. I’m not allowed to go anywhere other than university.”<br/>
</p><p>“You can now,” Lucia grinned. “I’ll be just here if you need anything.”<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you…” Rio replied before shutting the door.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What the hell is going on?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She grabbed her phone from her bedside table and made her way to the bathroom. As she brushed her teeth, a text message came in:<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Carlos: Have fun with Alice.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Rio laughed. The little shit had somehow persuaded their mother to loosen the reigns a little because of course he had. Her brother could probably get away with murder.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio: thank you :)<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Carlos: You’re welcome.</strong>

<p>Who <em>was<em> that?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>When Agatha had left with Wanda for class this morning, there was a girl…or…woman outside Rio-Sofia’s door. She was beautiful. Her smile was kind, and she had greeted Agatha by telling her good morning and calling her by her name.<br/>
</p><p>How had she known Agatha’s name?<br/>
</p><p>And then she’d appeared in the lecture hall with Rio-Sofia. They were laughing and nattering away in Spanish in the row a few above Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Was she Rio-Sofia’s friend? She looked around their age. But then she’d been outside her door, and she was wearing a pantsuit. What twenty-year-old university student wears a pantsuit to a 9 AM?<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia had mentioned she was getting a new head of security; was that her? Surely not. She seemed way too young and enthusiastic to have taken on a job so dull as to follow around a princess all day.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs!” Jen called from the kitchen when Agatha entered their flat after she’d returned from her lecture.<br/>
</p><p>She entered the room to see Jen and Natasha sitting around the island.<br/>
</p><p>“Have you seen her?” Her best friend asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Seen who?”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia’s new head of security.”<br/>
</p><p>So, she was her new head of security. “No,” Agatha lied.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh my god, wait until they come home, she’s gorgeous!”<br/>
</p><p>“Do you think she’d go for me?” Natasha asked. “Like, how old could she really be?”<br/>
</p><p>“Twenty-three, twenty-five at best,” Jen told her.<br/>
</p><p>"And I’m twenty-one in a couple of months, that’s perfect,” Natasha said.<br/>
</p><p>“Nat, I don’t think Rio’s head of security will be allowed to fuck one of her friends.”<br/>
</p><p>“Why not?” Natasha replied. “If Rio gives her the green light, I’m sure she would. I mean, who wouldn’t want to fuck me?”<br/>
</p><p>“Very true,” Jen agreed.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you two ready for tonight?” Natasha asked.<br/>
</p><p>The initiation process. Now that they were officially on the hockey team, they had to pledge their allegiance or whatever the fuck Alice had told them a couple of days ago, to solidify their place. They were yet to find out what they actually had to do, as Alice had said very ominously, ‘All will be revealed on social night.’<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Jen replied as Agatha sat on the stool next to her. “I don’t know how to prepare.”<br/>
</p><p>“That’s the point. Expect the unexpected,” Natasha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>“If you make me piss on the side of the pavement, I’m not doing it,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>It was common at UK universities that being initiated into a sports team was a gross and gruelling process. Billy had sat next to her again during her lecture that morning, and the little stalker somehow knew she was on the hockey team. He’d said:<br/>
</p><p>‘I don’t know about the girls team, but I heard from my second year flatmate on the boys team that last year he had to run twenty laps around the Waterloo campus, spit on the sacred tree ten times and then down three VK’s all in fifteen minutes. He threw up afterwards. Don’t throw up, that’d be so embarrassing!”<br/>
</p><p>She’d scowled at him, and he’d promptly shut up.<br/>
</p><p>Their front door sounded, followed by three pairs of footsteps and laughter.<br/>
</p><p>Alice, Rio-Sofia, and her new head of security appeared in the kitchen, <em>Blank Street<em> coffee cups in hand.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Hola chicas,” Alice greeted.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, Al,” Natasha replied. “I was just asking the girls if they were ready for the initiation process.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia hadn’t looked at her, but her head of security did and smiled. Not that Agatha cared if Rio-Sofia did or not. After their conversation last night, where the princess appeared to feel no remorse about what she’d said in her speech three months ago, Agatha would be happy if the princess never looked at her again.<br/>
</p><p>“And are you?” Alice asked.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Jen said again.<br/>
</p><p>“I just want to get it over and done with,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“What about you, Ri?” Alice said.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m unavailable this evening.”<br/>
</p><p>“Aw, Princess Rio-Sofia’s going to miss the ball,” Agatha snarked because she genuinely couldn’t help herself.<br/>
</p><p>The princess grinned like a shark. “At least you’re calling me by my title.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. She’d walked right into that one.<br/>
</p><p>“No, I want to go. I’m just not allowed. Unavailable really just means I’m going to be in my room rewatching <em>La Casa de Papel<em> (Money Heist).”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“What?” Alice asked, a frown on her face. “I thought your madre was giving you more freedom now.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, to go on the occasional coffee shop trip and maybe a museum. Socials are off limits.”<br/>
</p><p>The girls (minus Agatha) turned to Rio-Sofia’s head of security.<br/>
</p><p>“Is that true, Lucia?” Alice said.<br/>
</p><p>“Unfortunately,” Lucia replied regretfully.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, but have fun tonight,” Rio smiled. “I’ll be back; I’m just going to put my stuff in my room.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia left with Lucia by her side.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was honestly relieved. She would be able to be around the hockey girls without Rio-Sofia catching her eye wherever she looked. Things were looking up.<br/>
</p><p>“We need a plan,” Alice said in a hushed voice when the princess’s bedroom door closed. “My best friend is not missing out on initiation night.”<br/>
</p><p>Things were no longer looking up.<br/>
</p><p>“Agreed,” Natasha said.<br/>
</p><p>“What are we thinking?” Jen added.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glared at her.<br/>
</p><p>“What? It isn’t fair, Aggs,” Jen told her. “She’s been locked in her room all week now.”<br/>
</p><p>“And how is that our problem?”<br/>
</p><p>The three girls shot daggers at her.<br/>
</p><p>She held her hands up in surrender. “Fine, fine. What are we doing?”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The plan was simple enough. Rio-Sofia would tell Lucia that she wanted an early night, Alice would distract Lucia by asking for her help in the kitchen at the same time, the other girls would announce they were leaving for the social. With all the noise, Rio-Sofia could leave the flat with Lucia none the wiser.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had asked what they would do if she had other bodyguards outside of the flat, the girls had said that they’d cross that bridge when they got to it. Agatha didn’t vocalise the major flaw in that plan, more than happy to let Rio-Sofia get caught and sent back to her room if it came to it.<br/>
</p><p>The world would still spin.<br/>
</p><p>It was 7:45 PM, fifteen minutes before the initiation process started. Wanda was in Agatha’s room as she got ready.<br/>
</p><p>“But what do I wear?” Agatha asked with a huff. “Like do I wear shit that I don’t care about?”<br/>
</p><p>Not that she cared about much in her wardrobe. Most of her clothes covered far too much of her or didn’t fit her right. Her mother dictated everything she wore, and she hadn’t had time to shop for clothes since she’d moved to London. Jen’s wardrobe had become hers too. Her best friend had some pieces that weren’t some shade of pink and something Agatha would actually wear.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, do that. We come back to change anyway.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded, stripping off the white tee she’d been wearing all day and going over to her drawers to find a top she didn’t care about (which was most of them).<br/>
</p><p>“Wanna borrow one of my going-out tops later?” Wanda asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Is it that obvious I need one?”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda laughed. “Don’t get me wrong, you could wear a rubbish bag and still look hot,” she shrugged. “I just figured you would want to wear something from someone else’s wardrobe for a change.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled out a black top from her days as a volunteer at her local church, <em>St Mary of the Angels Church<em>, embroidered in white above her right breast. She tugged the shirt on.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha said as she brushed her dark hair out of her face.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Wanda replied.<br/>
</p><p>Now dressed (black sweatpants and crusty black <em>Air Force 1’s<em> she used to wear to work), all they had to do was wait for the signal.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>It came soon after.<br/>
</p><p>“Ey, Lucia,” Alice said from the other side of the door. “¿Me podría ayudar, por favor? I can’t open this jar of pickles.” <em>Could you help me, please?<br/>
</em></p><p>“Si,” Lucia replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s go,” Wanda said, her grin mischievous.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded and pulled open her bedroom door. Jen, Natasha and Rio-Sofia were in the corridor when they stepped out, and they hastily shuffled their way down it.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re going, Alice. Meet you there,” Jen said.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay!” Alice called from the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>There weren’t additional bodyguards outside their flat, so the girls bolted down the five flights of stairs (the lift was still bloody broken), out of their accommodation and down the street towards Euston Railway Station, where they were due to meet the rest of the hockey team.<br/>
</p><p>“I can’t believe that worked,” Rio-Sofia said through pants once they had stopped running.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not,” Natasha replied. “We’re smart girls, we would’ve figured something out.” She winked at the princess.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>That wink wasn’t necessary, Nat.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Let’s get this shit over and done with,” Jen said as the rest of their friends came over to greet them.<br/>
</p><p>Alice appeared five minutes later, a box of pickles in hand.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait…” Agatha started. “I thought the pickles were just a distraction.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice exchanged knowing glances with Natasha, they both had huge grins on their faces.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, for fucksake,” Agatha muttered.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, girls!” Natasha yelled.<br/>
</p><p>The hockey society gathered round.<br/>
</p><p>“Freshers over there,” she pointed to her left.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha, Jen, Rio-Sofia and the other first years moved to where Natasha had instructed.<br/>
</p><p>“The first round is easy.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen’s eyes widened. “First round?!”<br/>
</p><p>Their friend smiled. “Grab a pickle.”<br/>
</p><p>The girls did so.<br/>
</p><p>“All you have to do is run to our acom and back, but the pickle must be eaten before you return, otherwise you have failed.”<br/>
</p><p>“And you can’t throw it away, we’ll know, we have eyes everywhere,” Natasha added.<br/>
</p><p>“Anddd…go!” Alice said.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha lagged momentarily before she realised the other girls were moving. A beat passed before she started running. Luckily, Jen also had the same reaction, so they were at the back together. They ran down the street back towards their accommodation.<br/>
</p><p>“Is this legal?” Jen asked as Agatha bit into her pickle.<br/>
</p><p>She laughed around her mouthful, chewing the sour food…until that sour taste turned into pure heat.<br/>
</p><p>“What the-”<br/>
</p><p>“They’re spicy pickles!” Jen shrieked before it turned into a bitter laugh. “Our captains are sadists. You gonna be okay?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t handle spicy food; that’s why whenever she went around Jen’s house, Valerie had to make milder versions of their traditional Nigerian food.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt the sweat break across her forehead immediately, felt her cheeks grow hot, felt her mouth begin to burn.<br/>
</p><p>“Fine,” she got out weakly.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was in hell.<br/>
</p><p>She braced herself for her next bite, sucking in a breath before taking a larger one. The faster she ate, the quicker the pain could fuck off.<br/>
</p><p>Other girls had started to pass them as they came up to their accommodation, a lot of them red in the face. Rio-Sofia breezed past them, the pickles apparently having no effect on her; she was even…smiling?<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What the fuck? How is she enjoying this?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>When Jen and Agatha started making their way back to the station, Jen was done eating her pickle, and Agatha was three-quarters way there.<br/>
</p><p>“Come on, Aggs. Just swallow it and it’ll be done,” Jen encouraged.<br/>
</p><p>She nodded. She was sure her mascara was leaking down her face, and her nose was running. She popped the rest of the pickle in her mouth and cursed their captains as they sprinted back down the pavement.<br/>
</p><p>The second and third years were cheering when they made it to the meeting spot. Agatha noticed that the other first years were all downing a bottle of brightly coloured liquids.<br/>
</p><p>They were drinking fucking VK’s. The teenager had been right about something, but Agatha could not count on herself not to throw up, especially after eating that spicy pickle.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda handed her a black cherry-flavoured one with a smile. “Bottom’s up.”<br/>
</p><p>“Did you have to do this shit last year?” Agatha asked as she swiped the bottle from her hand.<br/>
</p><p>“Yup.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes before she tipped the contents down her throat.<br/>
</p><p>Her stomach twisted as the spices from the pickle mixed with the alcohol. And this was only round one.<br/>
</p><p>“Alright, well done you lot,” Natasha congratulated. “You’ve completed the first round.”<br/>
</p><p>“Round two,” Alice started. “Is to go in there,” she pointed at the pub at the bottom of the station, “And get a pint of whatever your heart desires…for free.”<br/>
</p><p>“Are you kidding?” Another first year, Kate, if Agatha was remembering correctly. “Looking like this?”<br/>
</p><p>She was right. Agatha knew she looked like most of the first years around her. Flushed, sweating, with mascara down their faces.<br/>
</p><p>“Do we get to freshen up first?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nope,” Natasha grinned. “But luckily for you, quite a few of the other sports teams are in there. So, pick a person and go crazy.”<br/>
</p><p>“You can get your free drink by intimidation tactics, flattery, begging, whatever you want…as long as you get it,” Alice added. “However, if you don’t like talking to strangers, you can get a friend to get one for you…as long as she gets it for free.”<br/>
</p><p>“Go on then,” Natasha said, shooing them away.<br/>
</p><p>“You know you lot are fucked for this,” Agatha told her friends as Jen dragged her away.<br/>
</p><p>They only smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Fortunately, Agatha was wearing all black, so how much she’d been sweating wasn’t evident. Some of the other girls weren’t so lucky.<br/>
</p><p>“How’d I look?” She asked her best friend.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…”<br/>
</p><p>She threw her hands up. “Great.”<br/>
</p><p>“Does it matter? I thought you’d just start intimidating some poor fucker until they caved.”<br/>
</p><p>“Could do, but flirting’s more fun,” she grinned.<br/>
</p><p>She had really mastered the art in the three weeks she’d been at university. Back in their small village, she was just the polite, reserved catholic girl. Here in London, Agatha was free to be her authentic self. Which was a huge flirt.<br/>
</p><p>When they entered the pub, a lot of the girls had already gotten to work. She saw some flirting with women on the girls football team, saw others explaining their situation to some poor tourists who had been in the wrong pub at the wrong time, saw a few bullying the men’s hockey team into buying, saw Rio-Sofia…<br/>
</p><p>With a huddle of people surrounding her.<br/>
</p><p>She was laughing and working the crowd as they drank in every word she said.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had never seen her like that. So carefree, laughing so hard, smiling so brightly.<br/>
</p><p>It made her feel…she didn’t know.<br/>
</p><p>A girl in the tennis society came up to Jen, and they exchanged greetings. She was on Jen’s course, and her best friend had mentioned her briefly. The girl turned her attention to greet Agatha, who was…distracted…<br/>
</p><p>“So, who wants to buy me that pint then?” Rio-Sofia said, her voice smooth, her smile inviting like one a princess would wear.<br/>
</p><p>Everyone in her vicinity shot their hands in the air.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, aren’t I just the luckiest girl in the world. You’re all so kind.”<br/>
</p><p>How…what…who…<em>was<em> that? Because that was not the stuck-up princess Agatha loved to loathe.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Agatha?”<br/>
</p><p>She turned to see her best friend with two pints of cider in her hand.<br/>
</p><p>“Here, babe. Take this.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. “You got us drinks?”<br/>
</p><p>Jen nodded. “Mindy got them for us because you were distracted…” her gaze shifted to Rio-Sofia, who was being handed drink after drink, before they returned to Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“I was not,” Agatha countered as she took the drink from Jen’s outstretched hand.<br/>
</p><p>“Sure…” her best friend said, although it was clear she didn’t believe her. “Are you ready to go, or do you wanna keep staring at Rio?”<br/>
</p><p>It didn’t go unnoticed by Agatha that Jen wasn’t calling Rio-Sofia by her full name. When had that changed?<br/>
</p><p>“I wasn’t staring at her,” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Sure…” her best friend replied in the same tone.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes before exiting the pub.<br/>
</p><p>She hadn’t been staring at the princess…she hadn’t…</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio returned to the meeting point outside Euston Station with two pints out of the ten she’d received in hand. She’d given the other eight to the girls who hadn’t managed to secure one yet. She didn’t know what to do with the extra one, so she brought it back just in case anyone needed it.<br/>
</p><p>“I think that’s the fastest a group of freshers has completed the second round,” a third year commented.<br/>
</p><p>“It was actually Rio-Sofia,” Kate replied. “She got a shit tone of drinks and gave it to us.”<br/>
</p><p>The third year nodded her approval.<br/>
</p><p>“Of course, she fucking did,” Alice grinned as she stood beside her. “Estoy muy contenta de que estas aqui.” <em>I’m so glad you’re here.<br/>
</em></p><p>“Yo también.” <em>Same here.<br/>
</em></p><p>“Okay!” Natasha clapped once all the girls had returned. “And on to round three.”<br/>
</p><p>“Chug or throw,” Alice said. “It’s simple enough, either you down your pint or choose someone on the team to throw it on.”<br/>
</p><p>“This will test your friendships…” Natasha continued in a stern voice before her lips split into a smile. “We’re joking, but it will tell us who you’re mates with and who you can’t stand.”<br/>
</p><p>The group of first years just stood and stared at their captains as if they were crazy.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you serious?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Deadly,” Natasha replied, her smile unwavering. “Go on then.”<br/>
</p><p>Again, nobody moved, well until…<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry about this, Kate,” a girl said from behind Rio. She turned just in time to see the girl tip her pint of beer on jet black hair.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, you bitch,” Kate replied with a laugh as she threw her own pint on the other girl.<br/>
</p><p>She too laughed. “I’m sorry! I just couldn’t chug any more alcohol right now after that VK and pickle.”<br/>
</p><p>“Dude,” Alice said to her as the other girls started completing the task. Shrieks and encouraging cheers for the girls who were downing their drinks started soon after. “You still have a whole night of drinking to go.”<br/>
</p><p>The first year that had poured the first drink groaned, and Alice laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio felt the splatter of liquids hit her body as she looked at the scene behind her. Girls were chasing after each other with pints of whatever beverage they had; some were trying their hardest to knock back their drink as quickly as possible, but everyone was laughing or encouraging one another in some way.<br/>
</p><p>She smiled. It had been a long time since Rio had been around this many people her age, it had been a long time since she’d been surrounded by so much laughter, it’d been a long time since Rio didn’t feel so lonely.<br/>
</p><p>“So,” that voice said from behind her, “What’s it going to be?”<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes met brown.<br/>
</p><p>In all honesty, Rio hadn’t thought about what she’d do with her two pints. No one had needed the spare. Could she down two pints? She’d decided then and there she wouldn’t throw either of them on Agatha. She was <em>trying<em> (although she had failed miserably after she’d replied to Agatha’s snarky comment this morning with just as much snark) to be less bitchy towards the other girl.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>After last night, Rio understood that Agatha hated her because, in her eyes, Rio had failed. Failed to claim what she’d done, failed to own her sexuality and be out and loud about it, failed to be more than just a stuck-up princess.<br/>
</p><p>And Rio would never tell her the truth. Would never tell her that it wasn’t her choice, would never tell her that it was all lies and she didn’t believe a word of what she’d said in her speech, would never tell her that the stuck up princess routine was just an act to cover up the truth that Agatha hurt her feelings.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha held her gaze for a long time, her eyes kept flickering between the two pints in Rio’s hands and Rio as if she <em>wanted<em> Rio to throw them on her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio let Agatha take her in for a moment longer before she smiled and lifted the glass to her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Weeee…” Natasha and some of the other girls started chanting. “Like to drink with Rio cause Rio is our mate, and when we drink with Rio, she gets it down in eight…seven…”<br/>
</p><p>The girls continued the countdown as Rio forced <em>Thatchers Gold<em> down her throat. It didn’t help that the cider was ice cold, fresh from the pipe. She could feel the brain freeze spreading inside her head.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Two…one! Wooo!” The girls congratulated as Rio finished her drink before the time ran out.<br/>
</p><p>She shook her head to get the brain freeze to calm down.<br/>
</p><p>When Alice took the empty glass from her hand and Rio had finished wiping her mouth with the back of hers, she locked onto Agatha again. Her eyebrows were furrowed ever so slightly. If you looked hard enough, one might say she looked confused, shocked, even.<br/>
</p><p>“Hm,” the sound was short, almost a scoff.<br/>
</p><p>Rio felt it before she registered it. Cold liquid trickling down from her head onto the rest of her body. The other girl smirked with her now-empty pint of cider in her hand.<br/>
</p><p>“Ooh,” she heard some other girls and Wanda exclaim, her teeth biting down on the hand she was using to cover her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>Before Rio could react, she felt something else splash onto her, except this time it was residue from where cider had been poured on Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Jen cackled. “Sorry, Aggs,” she said with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to kill you.”<br/>
</p><p>The other girl’s best friend only laughed and then everyone was laughing again.<br/>
</p><p>Rio still had one pint left, and she knew exactly what she was going to do with it.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry about this,” she said before tipping her remaining pint of cider onto her own best friend's head.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey!” Alice scolded. “No attacking the second or third years!”<br/>
</p><p>War broke out.<br/>
</p><p>All the first years turned to each other, nodded, and collectively decided to throw what was left of their drinks onto said second and third years.<br/>
</p><p>They reacted in kind, grabbing the leftover VK’s and water bottles from the boxes laid out for the initiation process and throwing them on the first years and each other.<br/>
</p><p>Soon, everyone was laughing and squealing as a full-blown water fight commenced outside of Euston Station at 9 PM on a Wednesday.<br/>
</p><p>Alice went straight for Rio, chasing her best friend as she relentlessly threw water at her. When Alice was through with her, Rio was drenched from head to toe.<br/>
</p><p>“How’s this fair, Al?” Rio smiled. “I threw one drink!”<br/>
</p><p>“You started it,” Alice shrugged, a smile on her own lips. “Vamos.”<br/>
</p><p>They’d ran a short distance away from the other girls. As they made their way back, Alice slung an arm around her shoulder.<br/>
</p><p>Upon arrival, Rio witnessed Wanda with an arm wrapped around Agatha’s stomach as she poured water over her. The other girl was laughing whilst trying desperately to wriggle out of the redhead's grip.<br/>
</p><p>That stupid, sick feeling twisted Rio’s stomach like always. She needed to get a grip.<br/>
</p><p>“On that note,” Natasha started once everyone had stopped throwing drinks at one another. “I think it’s safe to call it. Well done first years!”<br/>
</p><p>The hockey society clapped and cheered.<br/>
</p><p>“Fucking finally,” Jen muttered as she slid into the spot next to Alice.<br/>
</p><p>“You are finally free to freshen up for pres before we go out tonight!”<br/>
</p><p>More claps and cheers.<br/>
</p><p>“Remember to come to my flat in half an hour,” Natasha continued. “There’s going to be drinks and games, but remember to bring your own as well because there won’t be enough for all seventy-plus of you. And let’s go out and have a good time tonight, ladies!”<br/>
</p><p>There was one last round of applause and a series of ‘whoops’ before the crowd began to disperse.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait, Al…I can’t be near the flat again. I’ll get caught.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice’s face dropped. “Oh, shit.”<br/>
</p><p>“What is it?” Natasha asked from where she was packing away the unused water bottles and pickles.<br/>
</p><p>“Ri can’t be near the flat in case Lucia or any of her security spots her.”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha waved them off. “She’ll be fine. Get ready at mine and don’t leave until we’re all going to the club. There’s so many of us, I doubt any of her security will notice her in a sea of girls.”<br/>
</p><p>“Nat, not trying to be funny, but that is literally their job. To pick Rio out in a sea of girls,” Alice replied.<br/>
</p><p>Rio hated to admit it, but it was true. “I might have to call it. I mean, I didn’t miss the initiation, so that counts for something,” Rio offered.<br/>
</p><p>“No, Rio,” Natasha said firmly. “You’re doing the whole night out. We’ll carry you around in one of those wheelie bins if we have to.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. It felt nice to be wanted somewhere.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>They really did put Rio in a wheelie bin. Alice found an empty one in their accommodation’s bin room. It was empty and relatively clean. They lugged it up the four flights of stairs before instructing Rio to get in once they hit the fifth.<br/>
</p><p>Still, there was no security outside their flat door. That wouldn’t happen until Lucia was off duty at midnight.<br/>
</p><p>Once in Natasha’s flat corridor, she opened the bin lid to let Rio out, that smirk she often wore on her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Think you might need a shower,” Natasha teased.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “Thank you for this, Nat. Really.”<br/>
</p><p>The redhead waved her off again. “You can shower and stuff at mine and borrow some of my clothes,” she said, opening her bedroom door.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, going to pull open the bathroom door until she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Nat, are you sure? You’re going through a lot of trouble and I-”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha cut her off. “Hey, I would be a really shitty captain if I let one of my girls miss out on a social night, alright? So, stop yapping and go shower.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled and did so.<br/>
</p><p>Twenty minutes later, both girls were showered and dressed. Natasha was wearing a denim mini skirt and black lace-trimmed cami-top that hugged her figure just right. Rio was wearing a pair of Natasha’s black baggy jeans and a deep red tube top.<br/>
</p><p>Alice was with them now, too; she was sitting on Natasha’s bed as she put waves in Rio’s hair with Natasha’s curling iron. Alice was in all black, wearing purposely designed worn-out baggy jeans and a tight-fitted black long-sleeve top with a low neckline. She’d accessorised with a red belt and silver jewellery.<br/>
</p><p>They were two bottles of wine deep between the three of them. And between the VK and the pint of cider Rio had chugged earlier, she was really feeling it.<br/>
</p><p>“We should’ve done your hair before we started drinking,” Alice laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Why? You gonna burn my hair off?” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Wasn’t planning on it but now…”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed.<br/>
</p><p>A few of the hockey girls had already arrived. They were in the kitchen playing music as Natasha finished her makeup.<br/>
</p><p>“Plan for tonight anyone?” Natasha asked as she applied mascara to her long lashes.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve only got my eye on one person,” Alice replied.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha and Rio exchanged knowing glances, smiles on their lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Would that person happen to go by the name of Jennifer Kale by any chance?” Rio asked, she’d put on a faux British accent.<br/>
</p><p>“Hmm, I think you might be right, Rio.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice shoved her in the shoulder playfully. “Shut up.”<br/>
</p><p>“What about you, Nat?”<br/>
</p><p>She shrugged. “If you’re hot and single, that’s all I need.”<br/>
</p><p>“What about Steve?” Alice asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Who’s Steve?”<br/>
</p><p>“Captain of the men’s hockey team,” Alice told her best friend.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha groaned. “It’s not a thing. Sometimes a girl just wants to sleep with a guy who worships the ground you walk on. It’s very good for the soul. Plus, I don’t think so. I want to get with strictly girls tonight.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio and Alice nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“What about you, Rio?” Natasha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s entire body tensed. What could she say? The truth was, Rio probably wasn’t kissing anyone tonight. She still wasn’t allowed to be out, and she was still the princess of Spain. What if someone recognised her with her tongue down a random girl’s throat, filmed it, and then it was all over the tabloids tomorrow?<br/>
</p><p>Her mother would have her on a one-way ticket to hell.<br/>
</p><p>So, as much as Rio wanted to make out with a beautiful girl in the middle of a dance floor, drunk out of her mind, she said:<br/>
</p><p>“No plan.”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha turned to face her from where she’d been looking in her mirror. “Are you-”<br/>
</p><p>Saved by the hockey girls. Cheering and what sounded like a stampede sounded along the corridor.<br/>
</p><p>Alice grinned. “Let’s fucking go.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>This wasn’t new information.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was attracted to Rio-Sofia, had been since she first laid eyes on her when she’d watched that video of her speech in her childhood home three months ago. It was the reason she had to rewatch said speech and came to the realisation that she hated the princess.<br/>
</p><p>And she still did.<br/>
</p><p>Just because earlier in the pub she’d seen Rio-Sofia laugh properly for the first time didn’t mean she’d just forget all the shit she’d pulled.<br/>
</p><p>It was possible to hate beautiful things. Rio-Sofia was like how Agatha viewed lavender. The flower was her favourite colour, stunning to look at, especially when in neat rows in lavender fields. But when you get up close, you realise the smell is too strong and it makes you sneeze, you realise you have to be cautious, otherwise you’ll get stung by wasps and bees, you realise you <em>can’t stand<em> lavender.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>It is only pretty to look at.<br/>
</p><p>She’d gotten ready in Wanda’s room. Whilst the girls had decided on yet another flawed plan to get Rio-Sofia out of the building by putting her in a wheelie bin, Agatha had gone to her room to shower and change before heading over to Wanda’s.<br/>
</p><p>She wasn’t proud of it, but after her shower, she opened the bottle of wine she’d bought for pres and downed half of it as she sat in her towel, her hair soaked. She needed to get drunk and fast; her brain kept replaying Rio-Sofia’s smile on loop.<br/>
</p><p>Lucia was still outside Rio-Sofia’s room, none the wiser as she left. She’d produced Agatha one of those kind smiles she always did when she saw her.<br/>
</p><p>Now, Agatha was sitting in the flat next door's kitchen with the entire hockey society. Music was playing from Natasha’s speaker, everyone was laughing or smiling, and Agatha was relatively buzzed.<br/>
</p><p>“Alright, Jen. Your go,” Wanda said.<br/>
</p><p>Some of them were also playing Ring of Fire.<br/>
</p><p>“Okayy…” her best friend shifted further off the sofa to reach the table that was covered in a circle of cards. A cup mixed with various alcoholic beverages in the centre.<br/>
</p><p>Jen cautiously pulled at a card closest to her, she succeeded in not breaking the circle.<br/>
</p><p>“Nine, rhyme,” Jen announced. “The word is cat.”<br/>
</p><p>“That’s so easy, Jen!” Agatha exclaimed as her best friend shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“Bat,” Natasha started.<br/>
</p><p>“Sat,” Agatha added.<br/>
</p><p>“Chat,” Wanda, next to her, continued.<br/>
</p><p>They went round the circle, Darcy, Monica, Gamora, Kate, Rio-Sofia, Alice, and some other girls Agatha didn’t know the names of, adding their own words. Everyone completed the task with ease.<br/>
</p><p>“Told you it was too easy,” Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>It was Natasha’s turn next. She pulled an eight.<br/>
</p><p>“Eight, mate. Oh Rio-Sofiaaa,” Natasha sing-songed. “Have a drink with me, why don’t you?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia smiled before she leaned over the table to cheers with Natasha before they brought their plastic cups filled with whatever alcoholic drink they had in them to their lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Chug! Chug! Chug!” The girls chanted, which was then followed by screams once they had finished.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia wiped the excess liquid from her mouth with a smirk as she looked at Natasha.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, my turn,” Agatha announced because she wanted to interrupt whatever the fuck that was.<br/>
</p><p>She narrowed her eyes as they darted around the circle of cards. She stretched across the table to pick up a card at the edge of it. With slow, precise movements, she freed the card without breaking the circle.<br/>
</p><p>“Queen, question master,” Agatha told the group.<br/>
</p><p>“Pick someone to ask a question to, Aggs,” Jen said.<br/>
</p><p>A smirk slid across Agatha’s face. Oh, she was going to have fun with this.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia, I have a question for you.”<br/>
</p><p>She felt her best friend tense beside Natasha.<br/>
</p><p>The princess smiled. “Go on.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s smirk only grew wicked. “Why are you such a bitch?”<br/>
</p><p>The energy shifted in the room immediately. Even the girls who weren’t playing stopped their conversations and laughter.<br/>
</p><p>“Come on, Agatha,” Alice warned.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Jen chimed in. “Ask her something else.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Fine, you’re all no fun.”<br/>
</p><p>She leaned back to think. She needed the question to throw Rio-Sofia completely off guard without the group scolding her for it.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Think, think, think. What could I…<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Her smirk only grew more menacing when she settled on the question.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha leaned forward again, her eyes never leaving dark brown.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia, do you find me attractive?”<br/>
</p><p>She watched the princess’s smile drop.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Bingo!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The princess swallowed.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, this is going to be great, I wonder what bullshit she’s going to-<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Why lie, right?<br/>
</p><p>Yes, Rio found Agatha attractive. It was the first thing she’d thought when she’d seen her for the first time.<br/>
</p><p>The other girl jerked her head back slightly, a reaction that you would’ve missed if you hadn’t been looking at her, which Rio always was.<br/>
</p><p>She saw Wanda narrow her eyes in her peripheral.<br/>
</p><p>“Was that the answer you were looking for?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>For the first time ever, the brunette looked at a serious loss for words. Again, only something you would notice about her if you paid close attention to her. Rio saw it in the way her eyes kept flicking between hers as if she’d find the answer there.<br/>
</p><p>The entire room had fallen silent, the only sound was the music blasting through Natasha’s speakers.<br/>
</p><p>Eventually, Agatha cleared her throat. “Glad that’s been confirmed.”<br/>
</p><p>“My turn,” Wanda said hastily.<br/>
</p><p>Rio sat back in her seat, and her eyes landed on Jen. She saw the ghost of a smile there…or maybe Rio was just drunk.<br/>
</p><p>The redhead yanked at a card at random, and the circle split.<br/>
</p><p>“Wanda…you broke the circle,” Alice said awkwardly.<br/>
</p><p>The tension in the air hadn’t been defused yet.<br/>
</p><p>“You gotta drink, Ginger,” Natasha told her.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda nodded and grabbed the cup. She took one sip and spat it out.<br/>
</p><p>The room erupted into laughter, the tension vanishing.<br/>
</p><p>“Yuck!” Darcy grimaced as she wiped brown spit off her arm.<br/>
</p><p>“No! Finish it, finish it!” Natasha laughed as Wanda shook her head frantically.<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck did you guys put in this shit?”<br/>
</p><p>“Pickle juice…wine…tequila…hot sauce…” Alice got out through laughter.<br/>
</p><p>“Drink it, Wanda!” Gamora clapped.<br/>
</p><p>The redhead held her nose before she tipped the contents down her throat.<br/>
</p><p>Most of the girls watched with their faces twisted in disgust as she drank.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda stood up and slammed the empty cup on the table. “Finished!”<br/>
</p><p>Everyone clapped and cheered.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda bowed as she took in the praise. When she sat down again, her face was turning a slight green.<br/>
</p><p>“Ginger?” Natasha asked cautiously. “Don’t you dare-”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha cut herself off when Wanda shot up and bolted out of the room.<br/>
</p><p>“She’s gonna throw up!” Alice announced.<br/>
</p><p>A mixture of laughter and concern came as a result.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to go see if she's okay,” Agatha said, excusing herself.<br/>
</p><p>“Want me to come too?” Alice asked.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s fine.” She glanced at Rio once before she left the room.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Half an hour later, the girls were all far too drunk for their own good.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda had returned after throwing up, teeth brushed, makeup redone.<br/>
</p><p>When Alice had gone back to their flat to get a lighter from her room, she confirmed that Lucia was gone and one of Rio’s security guards was outside the door. Rio would have to get into the wheelie bin after all.<br/>
</p><p>Getting into it was much harder than before, considering she was drunk, and her foot kept missing the bin when she tried to step into it. Once she’d gotten settled, the girls began wheeling her out of the flat. The security guard on duty had asked them what they were doing, and Natasha had told her it was a hockey society thing. No further questions were asked.<br/>
</p><p>If Rio wasn’t as buzzed as she was, she might’ve been concerned that the girls might drop her as they carried her down the stairs. But she was so, this whole thing was utterly hilarious. She had to clamp her hands around her mouth to stop herself from giggling.<br/>
</p><p>She was in a fucking bin!<br/>
</p><p>She jolted when the wheelie bin dropped harshly on the ground.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry!” Alice apologised. Her best friend lifted the lid to find Rio beside herself. “¿Estás bien?” <em>Are you okay?<em> Alice said through a laugh.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Si,” Rio replied as Alice pulled her out.<br/>
</p><p>Her best friend brushed her hair out of her face from where it had gotten messed up with a smile. “Hermosa.” <em>Beautiful.<em><br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio grinned. “As are you.”<br/>
</p><p>Now, outside of their accommodation, the girls huddled around Natasha, who was stashing the wheelie bin away for safekeeping.<br/>
</p><p>“Alright, let’s go,” their captain urged.<br/>
</p><p>Alice linked her arm with Rio’s and started tugging her down the pavement towards Kings Cross, where the club was. Jen fell in line next to Alice.<br/>
</p><p>“Are we sure no one saw us?” Jen asked. “I mean getting Rio out?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shrugged; she was far too drunk to care. “I’ll deal with the consequences if they come.”<br/>
</p><p>She’d probably be eating her words later, but again, she was far too drunk to care.<br/>
</p><p>“Er…guys,” someone said from behind them.<br/>
</p><p>They turned to see a woman in a black suit step out of their accommodation. She turned her head left and right until she locked onto Rio down the pavement.<br/>
</p><p>It was Rio’s security guard.<br/>
</p><p>“Mierda.” <em>Shit.<em> Rio muttered under her breath.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Don’t just stand there fucking run!” Natasha told her.<br/>
</p><p>So, they did.<br/>
</p><p>All seventy-plus girls in the hockey society made a break for it. They bolted down the street, the buildings and the cars on the road beside them blurring as they went. Rio was laughing so hard tears smeared her vision.<br/>
</p><p>This was fucking hilarious.<br/>
</p><p>They ran past Euston Station, back past the pub from earlier, and didn’t stop until they approached the British Library.<br/>
</p><p>“I think we’re good,” Jen panted. “It doesn’t look like she followed us.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio turned to confirm for herself. Jen was right. There was no sign of her security.<br/>
</p><p>“Phew!”<br/>
</p><p>“What are you going to do when we get back?” Alice asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Future me’s problem,” Rio smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha walked past Rio then and joined the end of their line next to Jen. She smelled…different?<br/>
</p><p>“I just realised that’s not my top. Where’d you get it?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked down at her black laced corset top. “It’s Wanda’s.”<br/>
</p><p>And that’s why she didn’t smell like <em>Miss Dior<em>, she smelt like Wanda. Rio’s stomach curled.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“When are we going to go clothes shopping? You need your own clothes,” Jen laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Why? You sick of sharing your wardrobe with me?”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, yes,” her best friend answered simply.<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t do this. She fell back to where Natasha was a few heads behind them.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha greeted her with a smile. “Hey, pretty girl, you okay?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m drunk,” Rio replied with a lazy smile.<br/>
</p><p>“As you should be.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed before wrapping an arm around Natasha’s waist; the redhead did the same, and they continued towards the club.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<em>If fucked up princess…why hot?<em> Agatha asked herself when they had made it into the club.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>Again, she knew she’d always found Rio-Sofia attractive, but there must be something in the air today. Or maybe it was the fact that the princess had flat-out told her in front of everyone that she’d found <em>her<em> attractive.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha still couldn’t quite believe it. For someone who was potentially straight, she’d admitted her attraction boldly, answered with a simple yes and didn’t further elaborate. It was making Agatha’s head spin.<br/>
</p><p>She still <em>hated<em> Rio-Sofia, but…<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>Holy fuck she’s so hot.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The princess was laughing with Natasha, that small gap between her teeth on show.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Stop it. You’re just drunk.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Right. Focus on something else, like Wanda’s hand on your waist.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Wanda guided her towards the table that had been reserved for the hockey society. The girls who had arrived first at the table took up most of the seats. Agatha extracted herself from Wanda’s hold and walked over to where Jen, Rio-Sofia and Natasha were.<br/>
</p><p>The second she'd gotten within an inch of the princess, she swiftly moved to the other side of the table where she’d just been. Monica waved her over, and she went and sat next to her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Er…what the fuck?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She shook the thought away. That had nothing to do with her.<br/>
</p><p>“Right,” Natasha started. “Have fun, drink loads and find either me or Alice if you have any problems.”<br/>
</p><p>The hockey society nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Well…go on then,” Natasha told them.<br/>
</p><p>The girls started to disperse.<br/>
</p><p>“Make good choices!” Alice called out as she sat next to Rio-Sofia.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda walked up to Agatha then and Agatha moved away from her to sit on the other side of Alice.<br/>
</p><p>The princess slapped her hands on her knees. “Right, I need another drink. Nat?”<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t have to tell me twice,” the redhead extended her hand out for Rio-Sofia to take. She pulled her off the sofa with ease and the two ventured further into the club.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked. That was twice now. Twice she’d moved closer to the princess, and she’d run off.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What the fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Wanda slid into the spot next to her. She’d said something, and Agatha just nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha…are you listening to me?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned to face her. “What?”<br/>
</p><p>The redhead laughed. “I said do you want to dance?”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh…yeah sure.”<br/>
</p><p>“Perfect. Alice and Jen, are you coming?”<br/>
</p><p>The two girls were leaning into each other and giggling.<br/>
</p><p>“Nah, we’re good,” Alice replied.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha winked at her best friend, who rolled her eyes before Wanda tugged her away.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Were they playing a game of fucking cat and mouse?<br/>
</p><p>It’d been happening all night. Agatha would get close to the princess, and she’d move. It happened on the dance floor, at the bar whilst ordering drinks, whilst waiting for the toilet. And the whole time she’d been with Natasha, <em>touching<em> Natasha or Natasha would be touching her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Were they attached to the hip? Why were they always holding onto each other?<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t know why this was pissing her off so much. This was a good thing. The annoying princess was leaving her alone. Wasn’t that what she’d wanted this morning? For Rio-Sofia to miss the initiation process so she wouldn’t have to see her?<br/>
</p><p>Yes. Yes, it fucking was. So now the princess was actively avoiding her. Why was she having an issue with it?<br/>
</p><p>Her frustration was making her feel sick. She could barely tolerate Rio-Sofia, she was still the fucked up princess who had told the entire world that kissing a woman was the biggest regret of her life. </p><p>That was something Agatha would never be able to forgive…<br/>
</p><p>…So why was Rio-Sofia’s lack of interest <em>bothering<em> her?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Maybe it was the fact that she’d admitted she’d found her attractive, and now she was avoiding her. As if she could drop that bomb and then walk away from it and leave destruction in its wake. Well, she couldn’t. Not if Agatha could help it.<br/>
</p><p>She was dancing with Wanda on the dance floor; Wanda’s hands were on her waist. Agatha was looking past her to where Rio-Sofia and Natasha were talking to the men’s hockey team’s captain, Steve.<br/>
</p><p>The princess was laughing whilst Natasha held her firmly against her side. Even from a distance, she could see the way Natasha’s thumb kept stroking the exposed skin between Rio-Sofia’s jeans and her top.<br/>
</p><p>Why was she doing that? She didn’t need to do that.<br/>
</p><p>“I feel like you don’t want to be here.”<br/>
</p><p>“Hm?” Agatha asked, her eyes meeting green.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re not really dancing…what’s up?”<br/>
</p><p>Her gaze shifted back towards the princess. People had gotten in her line of sight. Agatha quickly shuffled Wanda along to get a better view again. The princess was whispering something into Natasha’s ear, and she was nodding.<br/>
</p><p>It seemed like Natasha was telling her to hold on, and Rio-Sofia was wiggling around on the spot. She whispered again, and Natasha nodded once. Rio-Sofia was leaving, Rio-Sofia was…<br/>
</p><p>“One sec,” Agatha told Wanda. She ignored the other girl’s protests and made quick work of crossing to the other side of the dance floor.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, Nat. Where’s Rio-Sofia?”<br/>
</p><p>“She’s going to the toilet. I’m going in a sec, I just gotta wrap this up,” her eyes shifted to Steve, who smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll go with her.”<br/>
</p><p>“Er…I don’t think that’s a good idea-”<br/>
</p><p>“Thanks, Natasha!” Agatha cut her off before heading for the stairs that led to the bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>She weaved through people as she bolted up them. Once upstairs, she craned her head left and right until she saw a slither of brown hair down the packed corridor, entering the single bathroom to the left.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha all but shoved the strangers aside until she reached the door and yanked. It gave way thank fuck, and she stepped inside.<br/>
</p><p>Brown eyes widened when Rio-Sofia took her in.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re not Natasha.”<br/>
</p><p>“What gave it away?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha locked the door and stepped forward.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia wrinkled her nose and took a step back.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows because what the fuck.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you doing in here, Agatha?” Rio-Sofia asked.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I don’t fucking know!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Why?”<br/>
</p><p>The princess threw her hands up. “Oh, I don’t know because I want to pee! Can you leave, please?”<br/>
</p><p>“No.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia rolled her eyes before taking a step towards the door. Agatha blocked her path.<br/>
</p><p>She huffed. “I don’t want to fight with you, okay? So could you let me leave?”<br/>
</p><p>“No.”<br/>
</p><p>“Why not?”<br/>
</p><p>“Are princesses not allowed to use the toilet in front of other people?"<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia didn’t reply, just stared at her. Agatha stared back. They stood in a tense silence; the only sounds came from the people outside and the music from the club below.<br/>
</p><p>After a while, Rio-Sofia tried to move towards the door again, and once again, Agatha blocked her from doing so.<br/>
</p><p>“You know you never apologised. About throwing away the food.”<br/>
</p><p>It wasn’t relevant but she needed Rio-Sofia to stay in the toilet with her for a reason she didn’t know.<br/>
</p><p>“You just bought it all back and expected that to solve everything,” Agatha continued.<br/>
</p><p>The princess’s expression turned sombre. “I didn’t know they were going to do that,” she quietly admitted.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t know that.<br/>
</p><p>“But you’re right. I should’ve explained and apologised when it happened, so I’m sorry.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha hadn’t expected that.<br/>
</p><p>“Well…you aren’t forgiven.”<br/>
</p><p>The princess nodded once.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Why isn’t she fighting back?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>That’s what they did, wasn’t it? They snapped at each other. The game wasn’t fun if it was only Agatha playing it.<br/>
</p><p>“Can I leave now, please?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha should let her. There was nothing left to be said. She’d gotten an unexpected apology, and she didn’t want to talk about the whole speech thing because that would end horrifically. But Rio-Sofia looked so pretty in the dim lighting of the bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>Her hair was in loose waves, her eyes popped because of the black eyeliner on her lids and water line and her lips…<br/>
</p><p>So, because of this, Agatha said:<br/>
</p><p>“No.”<br/>
</p><p>The princess jerked her head back. “Why not? I told you,” she stepped towards her for the first time all night. “I don’t want to fight with you! Not now, not ever.” She took another step forward. “So, can you quit trying to get me to?” She took another step forward, and Agatha’s body slammed against the bathroom door.<br/>
</p><p>“Why are you so desperate to get under my skin?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged nonchalantly even though her heart was pounding. “You’ve lived comfortably enough in that palace of yours. I’d like to bring you back to reality.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia scoffed.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha flinched when the door jolted. Rio-Sofia had smacked her hand against the door by her head.<br/>
</p><p>“Again, you don’t know what you’re talking about.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was losing control of this situation. She needed the tables to turn back in her favour.<br/>
</p><p>She laughed breathlessly. “You’re getting off on this, aren’t you?”<br/>
</p><p>“Aren’t you?” Rio-Sofia shot back. “<em>You<em> were the one who came in here and ambushed me!”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>There it is.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The push back Agatha was looking for.<br/>
</p><p>A slow smirk slid across her face as she watched Rio-Sofia’s expression shift. She knew she’d fallen for it, risen to the bait just as Agatha had wanted her to.<br/>
</p><p>Her brown eyes flicked between Agatha’s as they glared at each other once again. Both of their breaths were audible, out of sync with one another.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia narrowed her eyes, and before Agatha could think, lips were on hers.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had to clench her body to stifle a moan because <em>god<em>, this felt good. Rio’s hand that had been on the door slid to her throat; she yanked Agatha forward as she deepened the kiss. Agatha took that as an invitation, forcing her tongue into Rio’s mouth.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The princess moaned, and if Agatha’s lips weren’t preoccupied, she would’ve smiled. Rio’s tongue moved against hers, and Agatha let her hands grab her waist, swiftly flipping the princess so that she was against the door. Rio’s head hit the wood with a bang, but that didn’t stop her. She didn’t pull away.<br/>
</p><p>Rio tasted divine.<br/>
</p><p>Again, Agatha had to tense so that she didn’t moan to let her know that. But when the princess’s free hand dropped to palm her ass, she was a goner. The groan left her mouth without warning, making them momentarily break apart before Rio swallowed the sound.<br/>
</p><p>She opened her mouth wider to let Agatha gain more access to her, and she took it in stride, slowing down the kiss to make it sinful. She moved her tongue purposely against the princess’s, heard her whimper, felt her shift against her body as if it wasn’t enough. As if she needed more.<br/>
</p><p>And it horrified Agatha when she realised she wanted to give it to her.<br/>
</p><p>The princess’s hand on her ass slid into one of her jeans back pockets. She used this to flip them again, turning Agatha and forcing her against wood. Rio lifted up her knee, pushing it softly against Agatha’s core.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Fuck,<em>” Agatha groaned, throwing her head back and slamming it against the door.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio’s lips were on hers again, her cool fingers trailing along Agatha’s exposed stomach, she felt the fingers move down towards-<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She pushed Rio off her. If they were doing this, it would be Agatha doing it to her, not the other way around.<br/>
</p><p>The princess smirked, her lip gloss smudged, her lips swollen.<br/>
</p><p>“See,” Rio panted. “Not straight.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glared at her as she tried to gain control of her own breaths. “I’m drunk,” Agatha stated. “And you’re still an arsehole and we are <em>never<em> doing that again.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio...no. Rio-SOFIA smiled. “Okay, Agatha.”<br/>
</p><p>She went to unlock the door, and Agatha stepped out of the way to let her do so. She slipped out of the room without another word.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha muttered.</p>

<p>After the princess had kissed Agatha, she started to (she wouldn’t say spiral) <em>spiral.<em><br/>
</em></em></p><p>She hastily wiped her lips of any trace of the princess, ran to the sink and the mirror above it to check here appearance (she was a state. Her hair a mess, her lips swollen, her eyes so fucking dilated they were almost pure black). She fixed her appearance as best she could, even contemplating gargling her mouth with toilet tap water to rid herself of Rio-Sofia’s delicious, no, disgusting taste.<br/>
</p><p>Once she was satisfied with how she looked, she left the bathroom, shot down the stairs back into the club and found Wanda. She yanked the redhead into a desperate kiss. Wanda would kiss away any trace of Rio-Sofia, and she could pretend the whole thing never happened.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda pulled away with her eyebrows furrowed. “What lip gloss are you wearing? Tastes good.”<br/>
</p><p>And Wanda just had to fucking say that didn’t she.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Can’t remember.”<br/>
</p><p>She looked past her, eyes scanning for the only person she’d wanted to see that. She locked onto deep brown, who was looking at her with a shit-eating grin on her face.<br/>
</p><p>No. No, she wasn’t supposed to look like that! Where was the disgust? Where was the aggravation?<br/>
</p><p>Agatha needed to do better.<br/>
</p><p>She spent the rest of her night making out with nearly every woman in the club. Each time she’d finished, she’d meet the princess’s eyes, and the same grin would be on her face…well, until the last girl. When she looked, the brunette had Natasha’s arm wrapped around her waist. They were laughing and leaning into each other, and Agatha was ready to kill someone.<br/>
</p><p>She left the main dance floor and headed towards the table reserved for the hockey society. Agatha blinked. Alice and Jen were still in the same place she’d left them almost three hours ago. At least they were having a good night.<br/>
</p><p>“Jen,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>Her best friend turned. “Oh, hey, Aggs. You okay?”<br/>
</p><p>“Can we go home…please?” Agatha was sick of this night.<br/>
</p><p>“Now? I wanted to help get Rio back into our acom.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Rio.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha wanted to never hear that name again. Why had she let her kiss her? And why was it <em>good?<br/>
</em></p><p>“I…just…please, Jen. I don’t feel good. I think I drank too much.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen sat up from where she’d been curled into Alice. “How long have you been feeling like this? Why didn’t you say anything sooner? Of course we can go home babe what the fuck.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded thankfully, and Jen gave Alice a quick kiss before they left.<br/>
</p><p>“You wanna stop at the corner shop? Get you some water? Maybe a snack?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I just need my bed.” <em>And to wipe Rio-Sofia off the face of the planet.<br/>
</em></p><p>Jen nodded.<br/>
</p><p>They arrived at their accommodation fifteen minutes later and were met with the princess’s security guard outside their front door. Agatha felt Jen’s arm around her tense.<br/>
</p><p>“Excuse us, please,” Jen said when she didn’t move out of the way.<br/>
</p><p>“Where is the princess?” Came the response.<br/>
</p><p>“We don’t know,” Jen replied.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had been looking down at the ground, Jen pressing her into her side.<br/>
</p><p>“And you,” the security guard asked her. “Do you know where she is?”<br/>
</p><p>This was the perfect opportunity to get Rio-Sofia banned from leaving the flat for good. She wouldn’t be allowed to attend hockey practice, she could never kiss Agatha again, hell, she might even get sent back to Spain. She should do it, snitch on her.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha answered. “I don’t know where she is.”<br/>
</p><p>Yet she didn’t.<br/>
</p><p>The security guard stepped aside, and Jen reached to tap her keycard against the door when the security guard spoke again:<br/>
</p><p>“Just…is the princess okay?”<br/>
</p><p>It seemed like the guard actually cared. Her tone of voice made it seem like she didn’t want to scold Rio-Sofia, only…protect her.<br/>
</p><p>“She’s fine,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>The older woman nodded, and Jen let them into the flat.<br/>
</p><p>“Goodnight, babe,” Jen told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Night,” Agatha replied, walking down the corridor to her own room.<br/>
</p><p>Once she was inside, she flopped onto her bed and crashed.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stirred awake, her eyes blinking heavily.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What the fuck?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Why was she still in her clothes from last night? And why hadn’t she taken off her makeup? And why did she still have her bloody shoes on? She hadn’t drank that much, had she?<br/>
</p><p>She groaned, lifting her face off her pillow that was now covered in makeup.<br/>
</p><p>“For fucksake,” Agatha muttered as she wiped at it. Now she was going to have to change her sheets.<br/>
</p><p>She kicked off her shoes and reached for her makeup wipes in her makeup bag. As she sat in front of the mirror to remove it, she clicked on her phone.<br/>
</p><p>17:45.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes almost bulged out of their sockets. It was a quarter to six in the afternoon?! No wonder she wasn’t severely hungover; she’d slept through the majority of it. How the hell had she let this happen?<br/>
</p><p>She got up, disposed of the wipes in her bin and headed for the shower. Agatha needed to get her life together. From letting Rio-Sofia kiss her to sleeping until six in the afternoon, she felt like her life was falling apart.<br/>
</p><p>The kiss, now that she was no longer drunk, and she could put it into perspective, was…fine. Kissing someone you hate whilst drunk is totally normal and acceptable. She thought of all the people who kissed or texted their exes whilst drunk. It was stupid and <em>normal<em> and would never happen again, so what did it matter?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The sleeping until six thing…yeah, she didn’t have an excuse for that. <em>Do better<em>, she told herself and left it at that.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>After she’d showered and brushed her teeth, she pulled on one of those shirts she didn’t care much for and a pair of Jen’s sweatpants and headed towards her door. She was starving and that pickle she’d been forced to eat yesterday was the last thing she’d eaten.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha opened her door, she almost slammed into Lucia. Her hand was raised as if she were about to knock. In the other, she had a large white paper shopping bag.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow.<br/>
</p><p>“Good afternoon, Agatha,” Lucia smiled her typical smile. “This is for you.” She handed Agatha the bag, and she almost dislocated her shoulder when it dropped to the ground.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, sorry!” Lucia apologised. “I’ll just tell them to carry the rest of it in.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha jerked her head back. “Erm…the rest of it?”<br/>
</p><p>As soon as she’d finished her sentence, four men walked into her room with more shopping bags and boxes.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Err…??<br/>
</em>
</p><p>They placed them about her room before leaving again.<br/>
</p><p>“And there’s this.” Lucia handed Agatha an envelope. “Tell her or me if you don’t like something or you want a different size, and we’ll sort it.”<br/>
</p><p>“Thank…thank you?”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Lucia smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha closed her door and stared at the bags and boxes.<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck?”<br/>
</p><p>She ripped the envelope and opened up the plain white card within:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<strong>I’m sorry again. Heard you needed a new wardrobe.<br/>
</strong>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<strong>-	R.V<br/>
</strong>
</em>
</p><p>There’s no way she would…<br/>
</p><p>Agatha opened the closest bag to her left, and lo and behold, it was filled to the brim with clothes.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No fucking way, no fucking way.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She opened the next bag and found more clothes. She opened a box and found a pair of black leather knee-high boots; she opened the box to her right and found red <em>Adidas Spezials.<em> There was no fucking way the princess had bought her a whole wardrobe…right? Because that would be insane…<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha gaped at the bags and boxes. How would Rio-Sofia even know her shoe size, or her clothes size or what type of clothes she liked? She grabbed at one of the bags and tipped the contents onto her bed. Agatha picked up a grey shirt, expecting to absolutely hate it…<br/>
</p><p>Why was it the cutest shirt she’d ever seen? It was a grey button-up with gold metallic buttons with crosses etched within. It was something Agatha definitely would’ve picked out for herself.<br/>
</p><p>Okay…one lucky guess.<br/>
</p><p>She picked up another top. This was a going-out top. It was similar to the one she had on yesterday. A corseted black top with lace trimmings around the bust. Okay…next item. An off-the-shoulder navy knitted jumper.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw the jumper back into the pile. How the hell did Rio-Sofia know her style when Agatha hadn’t even had the chance to figure it out herself?<br/>
</p><p>She wouldn’t wear any of it, she decided. Yeah, so, the princess bought her a few clothes (try next to a hundred items) and some shoes (there were at least twenty shoe boxes) that didn’t mean all was well. It actually meant the opposite. Did the princess think she could just buy her way to forgiveness?<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed.<br/>
</p><p>She couldn’t.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Those boots are really nice though…<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Stop it.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>After Rio left the bathroom, she ran downstairs and back into the club. All thoughts about needing to pee forgotten. Why would you need the toilet if you’d just made out with a hot girl? A hot girl who fucking hates your guts.<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t stop smiling. When she’d kissed Agatha, she didn’t know what had come over her. She’d gone into the bathroom to find Rio…why had she done that? And then they were screaming at each other, and Rio had her backed against the door, and she'd looked so pretty.<br/>
</p><p>Her chest rising and falling rapidly, her pupils blown so wide they’d almost completely engulfed her beautiful blue irises. Rio had thought…<em>fuck it. Worst she could do is kill me.<br/>
</em></p><p>But Agatha hadn’t killed her and instead slid her tongue into her mouth and grabbed her waist and shoved her against the door.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>And we are never doing that again.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio had to stop herself from laughing in Agatha’s face. There was no way, not after that kiss, that they weren’t doing it again because it had been <em>good.<em> And she knew Agatha wouldn’t want to give that up. Even if that meant only getting to kiss her whilst they were drunk or shouting at each other. Rio didn’t mind; she’d be waiting patiently for the next time Agatha let her touch her again.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She’d wait a lifetime if that’s what it took.<br/>
</p><p>Now the brunette was making out with Wanda, and usually, that would make Rio sick to her stomach. Today, it was confirming what she already knew. The kiss was good, and now Agatha was spiralling because of it. She needed to prove to Rio that it had no effect on her when her actions were proving the exact opposite.<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes locked onto her across the club, and Rio could only smile. The game that they were playing had unlocked a new level, and Rio couldn’t wait to find out the new plays.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha spent the next however long making out with any girl that had a pulse, and Rio, quite honestly, was getting bored. But she’d watch because that’s what Agatha would want. She wanted to prove that Rio had no effect on her, and Rio had to smile to remind her she saw straight through it.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha had her arm wrapped around her waist the entire time as she spoke to Steve. Rio got what she meant now, about him worshipping the ground she walked on. Natasha would say jump, and Steve would ask how high.<br/>
</p><p>She got it, though. Natasha was gorgeous.<br/>
</p><p>About an hour after Agatha disappeared, Alice, Natasha, Wanda and Rio decided to call it a night. They said goodbye to the hockey girls who remained and headed home.<br/>
</p><p>“Where did Jen and Agatha go?” Natasha asked Alice as they approached their accommodation.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha didn’t feel good, so Jen took her home,” Alice replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh…she didn’t tell me that,” Wanda whispered.<br/>
</p><p>Alice shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“This wouldn’t have anything to do with how long you two took in the bathroom, would it?” Natasha glanced at Rio.<br/>
</p><p>She shrugged. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”<br/>
</p><p>“I thought you two hated each other,” Wanda jumped in hastily.<br/>
</p><p>“Er…” Rio didn’t hate Agatha; Agatha hated Rio. “It’s complicated.”<br/>
</p><p>“How?” Wanda shot back. “She shits on you ever chance she gets.”<br/>
</p><p>“Okayyy,” Alice interjected. “I think we all need our beds,” Alice said as she tapped her keycard, and their accommodation door opened.<br/>
</p><p>They weren’t bothering with the wheelie bin anymore. Rio’s security had already caught her, the damage had been done. Now a little less drunk, she was more concerned with the consequences of her actions.<br/>
</p><p>Her security was sure to tell her mother, and Rio was probably going to be at some conversion camp by this time tomorrow.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, well. At least she’d gotten a kiss with Agatha out of it.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you gonna say when your security asks you where you’ve been?” Alice asked as they made it up the stairs.<br/>
</p><p>“I think it’s pretty obvious where I’ve been, Al,” Rio laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“No, I know. Just know I’ll be by your side for the fallout.”<br/>
</p><p>“Me too,” Natasha chimed in. “I’ll tell the queen that I forced you out against your will, threatened the Spanish royal family or some shit.”<br/>
</p><p>“Nat,” Alice scolded, hitting her in the arm. “You can’t say that.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed again. “Thanks, you guys.”<br/>
</p><p>They pushed open the door to the fifth floor, and Rio locked eyes with her security. Her expression was stern and unwavering as Rio approached hand in hand with Alice. The four girls stared at her, and she stared back.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Estás bien, princesa?” <em>Are you okay, princess?<br/>
</em></p><p>“Si,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>She nodded before stepping away from the door.<br/>
</p><p>Was that it? No questions? No mention of the queen and how she’s on her way to get her right now? Rio figured she probably still was, her security was choosing not to tell her.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…goodnight,” Rio said to Natasha and Wanda.<br/>
</p><p>“Night,” the two girls said together as they tapped the keycard to their own door.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha gave Rio a warm smile before going into her flat.<br/>
</p><p>Alice let them in and shut the door behind them<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck?” Alice mouthed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Hopefully, I’ll see you in the morning. If not, come visit me in whatever prison my mother ships me off too.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice gave her a small smile. It was clear her best friend did not want to joke about the matter. She pulled Rio into a tight hug.<br/>
</p><p>“I love you, Ri. I’ll see you in the morning.”<br/>
</p><p>“I love you, too.” She didn’t say the last bit back. There was no hope for her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio entered her room, shut the door and locked it. She went to her desk, sat down and opened her laptop. There was one last thing she needed to do.<br/>
</p><p>She went on Pinterest and started a new board and called it ‘Agatha’s wardrobe.’ And scoured for hours, searching for items of clothing and outfits she’d thought the other girl would like. Then Rio contacted the palace and told them she needed the clothes by 12 PM today.<br/>
</p><p>If she was never going to see Agatha again, she could at least buy her some new clothes, as it seemed she needed them. Rio also didn’t want her smelling like Wanda, even if she wasn’t going to be around her. Wanda’s scent on Agatha’s skin was like bug repellent, and even if that hadn’t stopped Rio from kissing her, she didn’t want her smelling like her.<br/>
</p><p>She did this until she fell asleep at her desk at six in the morning.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>“Princessa?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shot up from her desk.<br/>
</p><p>Lucia knocked again.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She was still in last night's clothes. Her mother was undoubtedly behind the other side of her door, and it wouldn’t be doing her any favours to open it smelling of alcohol and cigarettes with ruined makeup and party clothes.<br/>
</p><p>“Princessa? ¿Estás despierto?” <em>Are you awake?<br/>
</em></p><p>“Si,” Rio replied. There was no point in dragging out the inevitable.<br/>
</p><p>She got up and went to the door. When she pulled it open, she only found Lucia, who looked her up and down with an amused expression.<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip.<br/>
</p><p>“Estaba comprobando si estabas bien.” <em>I was just checking on you.<em> Lucia told her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio nodded, waiting for the other shoe to drop. For Lucia to tell her that the queen would be arriving shortly.<br/>
</p><p>“Sus paquetes llegarán aquí pronto.” <em>Your packages will be here soon.<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio nodded again, waiting for Lucia to continue.<br/>
</p><p>“Puedes volver a dormir ahora.” <em>You can go back to sleep now.<br/>
</em></p><p>Was that it? No…that couldn’t be. Someone must’ve ratted her out.<br/>
</p><p>“I hope you had a good night out yesterday,” Lucia said with a wink.<br/>
</p><p>So, she knew, and so did Rio’s security guard last night…and yet they hadn’t said anything? Were they going to cover for her?<br/>
</p><p>“Yo…” <em>I…<br/>
</em></p><p>“Dormir bien.” <em>Sleep well.<em> Lucia smiled.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio could only blink. “Gracias.”<br/>
</p><p>“De nada.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shut the door.<br/>
</p><p>There was no fucking way.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Apparently, there was.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had showered, brushed her teeth, changed, napped, and still…no sign of her mother. Not even a text or a call. Maybe Lucia and her security truly were covering for her. She had to make sure to thank them properly. She didn’t know how yet, but she’d figure it out.<br/>
</p><p>Right now, though, she was starving. It was around 8 PM, and she hadn’t eaten all day. She got up and made her way to the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stopped short when she saw the other girl there. Agatha was wearing some of the clothes she’d bought her. An off-the-shoulder thin light blue jumper and grey baggy sweatpants. Her hair was in two Dutch braids, and Rio could see her assortment of gold earrings as they glinted off the lights in the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>She smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“You look good,” Rio said, because she was done pretending that Agatha didn’t.<br/>
</p><p>The other girl turned, a smile twitching her lips. “Don’t I always?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Rio replied without missing a beat.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. She was making a cup of tea. “Just because you bought me all that stuff doesn’t suddenly mean you’re off the hook…you know that right?”<br/>
</p><p>“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Rio grinned.<br/>
</p><p>She rolled her eyes again, disposing of her spoon in the sink before walking towards Rio. She stopped just short of being able to reach out and touch her.<br/>
</p><p>“I still hate you,” Agatha said, her voice low and gravely.<br/>
</p><p>Rio felt her body heating up. She didn’t miss, however, the way Agatha’s gaze dropped to her lips for the briefest of moments.<br/>
</p><p>She fought off a smile. “And I still like pretending that I do,” Rio replied in what she hoped had matched Agatha’s tone.<br/>
</p><p>The other girl scoffed before leaving Rio alone in the kitchen. She heard Agatha’s door open and shut.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled as she moved towards the fridge. “Game on,” she muttered to herself.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha twirled the ends of one of her Dutch braids around her finger as she waited for her tea to cool down<br/>
</p><p>
<em>You look good.<em> Rio-Sofia had shamelessly told her.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>Is that what she was doing now? Openly flirting? What happened to the princess in the video from three months ago? What happened to regretting kissing a woman and essentially denying the fact that she was queer?<br/>
</p><p>Why was Rio-Sofia <em>so confusing?<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha’s thoughts were interrupted by a knock on her door.<br/>
</p><p>She got up and went to open it. Her eyes narrowed when the person behind it was revealed.<br/>
</p><p>“What do you want?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia stared at her before stepping into the room. And for some reason, Agatha let her. The princess waited for the door to shut before she surged forward and kissed her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, god.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Because it was just as good as she remembered it. Rio’s warm tongue slid into her mouth, and her whole body shuddered. She darted her tongue out, parting Rio’s lips until…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Wait. Hold on.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She shoved Rio-Sofia back with so much force that she slammed into the door behind her.<br/>
</p><p>The two girls stared at each other, their chests rising and falling rapidly. After a moment, Rio-Sofia took a step forward, her hand grabbing her waist and yanking her forward.<br/>
</p><p>“Tell me.” She nodded. “Tell me you don’t want this. Tell me to stop pursuing you. Tell me to leave you alone and I will.”<br/>
</p><p>“I already told you we’re never doing that again.”<br/>
</p><p>“Then why don’t I believe you?” Rio-Sofia replied without missing a beat. She drew Agatha closer, her eyes filled with lust and longing. “Why are you still letting me hold you?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t fucking know.<br/>
</p><p>“Tell me, Agatha,” she’d drawn out every word. Her Spanish accent curling around every syllable, making Agatha’s hairs stand on end.<br/>
</p><p>“I hate you,” Agatha told her, because that was all she could think of to say.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s lips twisted into a grin.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glared at her, hoping that her gaze was filled with hatred and frustration before she pulled Rio in harshly by the neck and crashed their lips together again. She felt Rio smile against them and wanted to smack her.<br/>
</p><p>They stumbled towards Agatha’s bed, their lips still connected until Rio was pulling her light blue jumper over her head and Agatha was ridding Rio of her tank top. Then Rio was yanking her sweatpants down, and Agatha was trying to step out of them without breaking the kiss, and Agatha was pushing at Rio’s shorts until they joined Agatha’s clothes on the floor.<br/>
</p><p>Rio went to push her down on the bed, but Agatha caught her hand, twisted her and shoved her onto the bed instead. Like Agatha said, if they were doing this, she was doing it to the princess and <em>not<em> the other way around.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio propped herself up with her elbows as Agatha climbed on top of her, her right hand holding her up by Rio’s shoulder as she used her left to pull down her lacey black underwear. Without warning, she slid her hand down Rio’s core until she could cup it.<br/>
</p><p>The princess groaned as her palm made contact.<br/>
</p><p>“Jesus, you’re dripping. I’ve barely touched you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Hm,” Rio got out, but it was strangled and breathy. “Like you’re not.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt cool skin against her heated stomach. Rio snaked her hand beneath her underwear until she was cupping Agatha too.<br/>
</p><p>She bit down on her bottom lip to try and suppress the moan, but the sound that came out was far worse. A desperate whimper.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s palm slid easily against the wetness, and she grinned. “Told you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha woke up with a jolt.<br/>
</p><p>She blinked as the dream flashed before her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, for fucksake,” Agatha groaned. She shifted and felt the stickiness of her underwear. “Seriously?”<br/>
</p><p>“You okay?” Wanda croaked next to her. Her head pressed into Agatha’s neck.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” Agatha replied. “Go back to sleep.”<br/>
</p><p>She felt the redhead nod against her skin.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was so fucked.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio was late for her 12-2 PM seminar. The traffic in London today was horrendous, and she had to get to the Strand Campus, which was in Westminster of all places. If she could just take the tube, her life would be so much easier.<br/>
</p><p>She got out of the car when it pulled up and ran through the building towards her seminar room. When she walked in, all twenty eyes in it locked onto her. She bit her lip, Professor Calderu was in the middle of speaking.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m…I’m sorry,” Rio apologised.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s alright, dear. Take a seat,” Lilia smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded and scanned the room for an empty seat. Her mouth almost dried out when she locked onto deep blue.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was wearing a black and white pinstriped button-up with a black mini skirt and platform <em>Doc Martins<em>. Her hair was in loose, almost beach waves after she’d taken her hair out of her Dutch braids from last night. And she was wearing fucking glasses.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>When had Agatha worn glasses?<br/>
</p><p>On top of that, she’d left at least four of her top buttons undone, revealing a great deal of cleavage.<br/>
</p><p>Yeah, that did it. Rio was surprised she hadn’t fainted.<br/>
</p><p>She slid into the chair next to her without taking her eyes off her.<br/>
</p><p>The brunette raised an eyebrow, and Rio could only stare at her.<br/>
</p><p>Professor Calderu continued speaking, and it fell on deaf ears because why was Agatha literally perfect?<br/>
</p><p>“And you three can be in a group,” Lilia said, coming over to them.<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked. What had she missed?<br/>
</p><p>Lilia placed a piece of paper on the table with a question on it. “I want you to use the library, the internet, Google Scholar, etc. Research previous answers, collect data and evaluate how to answer the question properly. Next week, you will present your findings to the class.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked up to see Billy smiling at her. When had he gotten there?<br/>
</p><p>Lilia walked away, and the class just stared at her.<br/>
</p><p>She furrowed her eyebrows. “Well…go on then,” Lilia urged.<br/>
</p><p>Rio and Agatha reached for the piece of paper at the same time, their hands grabbing onto either corner. Blue eyes narrowed.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha lifted her hands off the paper and put them up in surrender. “Princess’s first.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “That was uncharacteristically nice of you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “I like to keep you on your toes, darlin.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Darlin<em>, said like that, said in her disarming British accent.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to reply, but nothing came out. Agatha smirked, she knew what she was fucking doing.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you going to read the question then, Rio-Sofia?” Billy asked.<br/>
</p><p>“I…erm…” Rio stuttered.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s smirk only grew.<br/>
</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and began. The question was about two men who had been fighting outside a bar. One of the hypothetical boys, Joe, had been beaten to a pulp. An ambulance had been called twenty minutes later, and once he arrived at the hospital. It was decided he needed a blood transfusion. The doctor, Doctor Murray, didn’t check what Joe’s blood type was, gave him the wrong blood and killed him.<br/>
</p><p>“Fucking idiot,” Agatha mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio let out a short laugh and quickly steeled herself when Agatha looked at her.<br/>
</p><p>The medical evidence indicated that the blood transfusion and the delay to arriving at the hospital contributed significantly to his death.<br/>
</p><p>“Consider the criminal liability of Daniel (the boy who beat him up) and Doctor Murray. You should focus your analysis on offences and defences that we’ve covered in lectures and our own research.”<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha clapped. “Let’s get to work.”<br/>
</p><p>“Does it say what Joe’s blood type was?” Billy asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s irrelevant anyways. They gave him the wrong blood.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh,” Billy squeaked.<br/>
</p><p>“You heard all of that and <em>that’s<em> the only thing you took from it?” Agatha asked, her face scrunched.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I…no…”<br/>
</p><p>“Why are you even doing law? You seem like you’d crumple under the slightest bit of pressure. And you’re like twelve.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not twelve!” Billy spluttered.<br/>
</p><p>“Right, you’re a <em>teen<em> forgot.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You’re only two years older than me!”<br/>
</p><p>“So you say,” Agatha replied, leaning back in her chair.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled.<br/>
</p><p>They spent the next hour and a half going over their notes from their previous lectures and how best they could apply them to the material, whilst Billy asked stupid questions. They set up a plan to meet at the British Library tomorrow at 11 AM.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had a new plan when dealing with the princess. After that very disturbing (fucking phenomenal) dream she had about her, she got an idea. She didn’t have to <em>just<em> be a bitch to Rio-Sofia, she was weirdly into that anyway, she could make her life hell.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>By baiting her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was a flirt. If flirting were an Olympic sport, she was sure she’d win gold. She could flirt with Rio-Sofia and see how far the princess would let her take it.<br/>
</p><p>So, when she found out she’d have to work with Rio-Sofia for a whole week, at first, she was annoyed, but then she realised the princess wouldn’t be able to escape her. Between hockey practice, living together, lectures and now <em>this?<em> Oh, Agatha was going to have a field day.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Her plan was already working. She’d seen the way the princess had looked when she saw her in their seminar and her reaction to Agatha calling her ‘darlin,’ fucking priceless.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s phone buzzed whilst she was walking to her accommodation after going to <em>Sainsbury’s<em> to buy some milk. Now, technically, she should not be going on her phone whilst going down a busy street next to a road, the London phone thieves were alive and well. But Agatha was prepared to kill someone if they dared try to take her purple iPhone 14 she spent all of last summer saving up for.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<strong>Fifth floor lesbians (and a princess), Jen: There’s a man in our flat???<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Fifth floor lesbians (and a princess), Agatha: Ew??? Wtf.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Fifth floor lesbians (and a princess), Alice: can you ask him to leave?<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Fifth floor lesbians (and a princess), Jen: He’s with one of Rio’s security guards. Rio, girl…who is he?<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>The princess didn’t reply.<br/>
</p><p>Well, now Agatha just had to get home. Who and why was there a fucking man in their flat and why did he know Rio-Sofia?<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha approached her accommodation door, Rio-Sofia was getting out of her car. Agatha hated how good she’d looked today. She was wearing a dark washed double denim set. She’d put little plaits throughout her loose waves and was wearing multiple silver hoops in her ears.<br/>
</p><p>“Who’s the man in our flat then?” Agatha asked when she approached with Lucia.<br/>
</p><p>The princess furrowed her eyebrows. “What are you talking about?”<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t know?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia shook her head and looked to Lucia, who was biting her lip.<br/>
</p><p>“Who is it, Lucia?” Rio-Sofia asked her.<br/>
</p><p>“I can only explain when we go up, the queen’s orders.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia looked at her in horror.<br/>
</p><p>As they made their way up in the lift (it’d been fixed thank fuck) Agatha was buzzing with anticipation, who was this mysterious man? Was the princess in trouble? Wait…that wasn’t a good thing because then she couldn’t mess with her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Wait fuck!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>They stepped out of the lift, and Rio-Sofia let them into the flat.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio? Is that you?” Alice called from the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio-Sofia replied. “Agatha’s here too.”<br/>
</p><p>They walked to the kitchen, and the man in question wasn’t exactly a man…he looked their age. He had chocolate brown hair, olive skin and green eyes. He smiled at Rio-Sofia when he saw her and completely ignored Agatha, which was perfectly fine with her.<br/>
</p><p>Lucia cleared her throat. “Princesa, esto es Mateo Ruiz.” <em>Princess, this is Mateo Ruiz.<br/>
</em></p><p>Mateo stepped forward, took Rio-Sofia’s hand and kissed it.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fucking cringe.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia flared her eyes; she looked like a startled deer, and Agatha had to laugh. Mateo’s eyes snapped to her, and she just shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“Encantada de conocerte.” <em>Nice to meet you.<em> He still hadn’t let go of Rio-Sofia’s hand yet, and Agatha could see her squirming to free it.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Err…si. Tú también.” <em>Er...yes. Same here.<br/>
</em></p><p>She finally freed her hand and discreetly wiped it on her jeans. Agatha had to laugh again.<br/>
</p><p>Mateo glared at her, and Agatha only smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Vas a almorzar con él.” <em>You’re having lunch with him.<em> Lucia told her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “Er…I can’t. Agatha and I have an assignment,” Rio said hastily.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait, what’s going on?” Jen interjected.<br/>
</p><p>“They’re going to lunch,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia’s jaw dropped.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh…wait fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She’d revealed her hidden card, that she could understand Spanish. She was trying to keep that fact under wraps just in case the princess and Alice ever thought about talking shit about her in front of her.<br/>
</p><p>“You speak Spanish?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, anyway, I can’t go,” Rio-Sofia repeated.<br/>
</p><p>“Las órdenes de la reina, princesa.” <em>The queen’s orders, princess.<em> Lucia said sympathetically.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio-Sofia scoffed. “Mierda.” <em>Shit.<br/>
</em></p><p>“Should we go?” Mateo asked.<br/>
</p><p>In all honesty, Agatha had forgotten he was even there.<br/>
</p><p>“Fine,” Rio-Sofia replied. “But she’s coming with me,” she pointed at Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“Done,” Lucia said.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>Jen blinked. “You’re gonna go…with them?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Sure, she owes me a lifetime of food anyway. Could be fun.”<br/>
</p><p>And it would be. Agatha would get to watch Rio-Sofia on a date with a man. It was going to be so awkward, so entertaining, so…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>…Wait.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha was going to have to watch Rio-Sofia go on a date with a fucking man?!</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>They were at <em>The Ritz<em> again. A private table again.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Why three twenty-year-olds needed to be eating at <em>The Ritz<em> for lunch, Rio didn’t know, but her mother was paying, so it wasn’t Rio’s issue.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She was sitting between Agatha and Mateo around their small circular table.<br/>
</p><p>Fucking Mateo. What was her mother thinking? Sending her off on some date without even fucking telling her. Inviting Agatha was a spur-of-the-moment type of thing. She hadn’t actually expected the brunette to say yes. But like Agatha said, she was keeping her on her toes.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled down her shirt, revealing more of her cleavage, and Rio had to turn away so she wouldn’t stare. Fucking bitch, she was trying to kill her.<br/>
</p><p>“So…” Mateo said awkwardly. “Have you found a church to go to yet, Rio-Sofia? Your mother, our queen, said you were looking for one.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Of course, she fucking did.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Er…no.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve found one, I can bring you to the next service if you would like?” Mateo offered with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>“No…that’s…it’s okay. I’m not catholic.”<br/>
</p><p>Mateo furrowed his eyebrows. “You’re not…catholic?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“But you’re the princess of Spain,” he told her.<br/>
</p><p>Yes. Rio was well aware.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snorted, and Mateo snapped his gaze to her.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, sorry,” Agatha said through a laugh. “Just because she’s the princess of Spain, she must be catholic?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Mateo replied sharply.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed harder. “That’s the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard. It’s like me saying I have to be catholic because my mother is.”<br/>
</p><p>“You grew up catholic?” Rio asked in surprise.<br/>
</p><p>“You couldn’t tell?”<br/>
</p><p>“I should’ve been able to,” Rio clicked her tongue. “You are a bitch, raging lesbian and a bit of a slag.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned. “There she is. I was getting bored with you being all nice to me. And look at you with the British lingo.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled back. “I learn from the best.”<br/>
</p><p>Mateo cleared his throat.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, right. You’re still here.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The two girls turned to him with bored expressions.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Qué quieres comer-?” <em>What do you want to eat-?<em> Mateo started before Rio cut him off.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Let’s stick to English, why don’t we? I wouldn’t want anyone feeling left out. Although,” she turned to Agatha. “You speak Spanish. Where’d you pick that up anyway?”<br/>
</p><p>“I did it for my GCSES and A levels,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “You did? Why?”<br/>
</p><p>The brunette shrugged. “Had a point to prove.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed playfully. “Of course, you did.”<br/>
</p><p>Mateo cleared his throat again. “So, food?”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The waitress had been and gone, their food had been ordered, and now Rio was sitting with a glass of Sprite and a slice of warm baguette on her side plate. She leaned across the table at the same time Agatha did to grab the butter. Their fingers touched, and Rio’s entire body buzzed.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What the fuck? I’m not even drunk!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The brunette raised an eyebrow. “I think it’s only fair you let me go first this time after the graciousness I showed you earlier.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio let go of the dish. “Agatha’s first,” Rio gestured.<br/>
</p><p>“Only correct answer,” Agatha replied as she took the butter.<br/>
</p><p>Rio watched as she tucked one of her loose waves behind her ear, revealing her decked-out ear covered in gold.<br/>
</p><p>“You look really beautiful today,” Rio told her before she had the chance to think.<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes snapped up from where they’d been concentrated on buttering her bread.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s these clothes,” Agatha replied. “Yeah, this super-rich princess took it upon herself to buy me some. I think she wants to be my sugar mama or something.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed, rolling her eyes. “The princess regrets nothing.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s face fell the slightest of inches like she wanted to soften her expression, but she steeled herself, her lips tugging into a smirk. “I noticed there were <em>a lot<em> of miniskirts…why’s that?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Was there? Rio genuinely hadn’t noticed; her brain was working on two settings: Agatha would like that, Agatha would burn that. Whatever she thought Agatha would like, she bought.<br/>
</p><p>But Rio didn’t say that…no…<br/>
</p><p>“Easy access.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha quirked an eyebrow, her smirk never wavering. “Oh, yeah? I’ll let Wanda know who to thank.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s hands clenched into fists underneath the table, but she kept her face neutral. “I’ll expect a handwritten letter from her and anyone else who benefits.”<br/>
</p><p>“Noted,” Agatha replied. She placed the butter next to Rio’s plate.<br/>
</p><p>“So, Rio-Sofia, what do you like to do?” Mateo asked.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>You’re still here???<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Oh…erm…”<br/>
</p><p>“Go on,” Agatha urged.<br/>
</p><p>“I like to sew and garden. I don’t have a garden here, but I have plants and flowers in my room. And cook. I love to cook,” the words tumbling out of her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you have a favourite flower or plant?” Mateo asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared at him until Agatha leaned forward, seemingly intrigued.<br/>
</p><p>“Lavender, azaleas, ferns.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows furrowed. “Lavender?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha muttered under her breath.<br/>
</p><p>Before Rio had a chance to ask, Mateo cut in:<br/>
</p><p>“Those are lovely choices, Rio-Sofia.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio cringed.<br/>
</p><p>“What about you, Agatha?” She asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Hockey, pissing off men, sleeping with hot women,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>Rio snorted, and Mateo looked at her in horror.<br/>
</p><p>“How long have you been playing hockey for?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Since I was eleven.”<br/>
</p><p>She let out a low whistle. “Long time. Did you ever think about going pro?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Couldn’t have even if I wanted to.”<br/>
</p><p>She’d said it with such finality that Rio knew there was a second force at play that had nothing to do with Agatha’s ability to play the sport.<br/>
</p><p>“Have you ever been to see an England game live?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha took a bite of her bread before she said, “Nope.”<br/>
</p><p>“If I can, I’d like to take you to one…one day,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s mouth parted as if she wanted to say something. In the end, she didn’t, just stared at her, but it was <em>different<em>. Rio had never seen her look at her like that before.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“What about you, Rio-Sofia? Have you watched any sports live?” Mateo asked.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Why the fuck is he still here?!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio blinked at him until Agatha said:<br/>
</p><p>“Enlighten us, princess.”<br/>
</p><p>“Formula 1 and football…<em>women’s<em> football. You couldn’t pay me to watch a bunch of sweaty men running about a field for ninety minutes.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha laughed. “What teams do you support?”<br/>
</p><p>“Real Madrid, obviously, and Ferrari.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ferrari? What colour are they again?”<br/>
</p><p>It was Rio’s turn to laugh. “Oh, come on, everyone knows that.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Nope.”<br/>
</p><p>“Red. Speaking of what <em>is<em> your favourite colour?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio figured she already knew she just wanted the confirmation.<br/>
</p><p>“Why? You gonna buy me everything that colour?” Agatha smiled. “Guess.”<br/>
</p><p>“Purple.”<br/>
</p><p>“I feel like you have people watching me. Why do you know that?”<br/>
</p><p>“Guess mine then.”<br/>
</p><p>“Green.”<br/>
</p><p>“I feel like you have people watching me. Why do you know that?” Rio smirked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as Mateo cleared his throat. He was like a pest that wouldn’t fucking leave you alone.<br/>
</p><p>“Mine’s orange.”<br/>
</p><p>“No one asked,” Agatha replied bluntly.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>She was being far too nice. Yeah, okay, so Agatha was switching tactics but that meant <em>flirting<em> not whatever the fuck was happening now. Why were they getting to know each other?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>They weren’t supposed to be doing that; that wasn’t what they did. She blamed Mateo (because everything was a man’s fault), if he hadn’t randomly shown up at Rio-Sofia’s door, then none of this would’ve happened.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Dickhead.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha had to do better.<br/>
</p><p>She took a spoonful of her tomato soup and purposely let some slip down the corner of her mouth. When she locked eyes with Rio-Sofia, the princess gestured to it.<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve got something…”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, do I?” she feigned surprise. “Silly me.”<br/>
</p><p>Without breaking eye contact, she pushed her thumb into her mouth collecting the soup before sucking on it. She watched the princess's throat bobble.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha dropped her voice low when she asked, “Gone?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia blinked before she nodded her head rapidly.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned, “Thanks, darlin.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia scoffed before sticking her tongue in her cheek.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Woah??? What the fuck was that?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>This was a new development; Rio-Sofia had never done that before.<br/>
</p><p>“So, you’re doing law?” Annoying Mateo asked the princess.<br/>
</p><p>She nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you enjoying it?”<br/>
</p><p>“Erm, it’s-”<br/>
</p><p>She cut herself off when Agatha slid her foot in between Rio-Sofia’s legs, pressing on the inside of her ankle.<br/>
</p><p>Brown eyes snapped to her, and Agatha smiled. “Go on,” her smile innocent.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha moved her foot up, and Rio-Sofia’s body stiffened.<br/>
</p><p>To drive the knife in Agatha:<br/>
</p><p>“Tell us,” she urged, leaning in and resting her hand on Rio-Sofia’s knee underneath the table.<br/>
</p><p>The princess’s eyes widened before she pushed her hand away.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s fine,” she got out. “I wouldn’t have picked it myself.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, no?” Agatha questioned; she slid her foot even further up her leg.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia bit her lip, and Agatha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>This was so fucking fun.<br/>
</p><p>“No, I would’ve done biology, but my mother wouldn’t let me,” she replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Wouldn’t let you?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>The princess shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Interesting.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“What about you? Why law?”<br/>
</p><p>Now, this Agatha could answer easily. She went to do just that when she felt soft skin on her bare leg. She looked at Rio-Sofia, who was leaning down ever so slightly, her fingertips creating patterns on her exposed leg.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fucking bitch.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She tried to pull it away, but Rio-Sofia had trapped it there, pressing her legs together so she couldn’t move hers.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t tell me I have you at a loss for words…” Rio-Sofia smiled. “With my question, I mean.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha should’ve known she wasn’t going to make it easy again after the way she had cleared the floor with her during their seminar earlier.<br/>
</p><p>“Law, because I like to prove people wrong when they doubt me, because they never should,” Agatha powered through. She would not allow the princess to know she was affecting her.<br/>
</p><p>“No, they shouldn’t,” Rio-Sofia replied, her voice far too raspy for Agatha’s liking.<br/>
</p><p>The waitress arrived then. Good, Agatha needed a new play.<br/>
</p><p>“How’s your food today, everyone?” The waitress asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to reply before the princess beat her to it.<br/>
</p><p>“Good, thank you. You’ve been such a wonderful waitress; I would like to pass on my compliments to your boss. What’s your name?” Rio-Sofia replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh,” the waitress blushed. “Erm…it’s Emma.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia smiled. “It suits you. You’re beautiful by the way,” Rio-Sofia told the stunning waitress with big hazel eyes, brown skin and curly hair whilst she was <em>still<em> drawing patterns on Agatha’s bare leg.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Why was this happening? Why did the princess have the upper hand? This wasn’t…she wasn’t supposed to-<br/>
</p><p>“Thank…thank…you,” the beautiful fucking waitress Emma stuttered. “You’re stunning also.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia’s smile only grew. “Why, thank you. I think you’ve just made my day. Nothing beats being complimented by a beautiful girl.”<br/>
</p><p>Emma continued to blush like a fucking idiot and Rio-Sofia was eating it up because Agatha had started squirming (unintentionally) in her seat.<br/>
</p><p>“How long have you worked here, Emma?” Rio-Sofia asked, carrying on the conversation that should’ve ended after she asked them if their food was okay.<br/>
</p><p>“Not long. I’m a uni student working here part-time.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, you are?” Rio-Sofia leaned in as if she were interested when Agatha figured it was just an excuse to reach further along her leg. “Where do you go?”<br/>
</p><p>“KCL,” Emma told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, no way! Us too, isn’t that right, Agatha?” She turned to her, her eyes mischievous.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was going to fucking strangle her.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm. Emma, don’t you have other tables that need attending to?” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Emma stiffened. “Erm…yes…yes. If you need me, feel free to shout.”<br/>
</p><p>“We won’t,” Agatha cut in before Rio-Sofia had a chance to flirt again.<br/>
</p><p>“We’ll let you know if we need anything,” the princess replied with her stupid fucking smile.<br/>
</p><p>Emma finally fucked off.<br/>
</p><p>“She seemed nice,” Mateo said, oblivious to what had happened.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Very<em>,” Rio-Sofia grinned as she finally let go of Agatha’s leg.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha shuffled up on her chair and moved her legs away from Rio-Sofia.<br/>
</p><p>She’d lost that round. Agatha fucking hated losing.</p>

<p>“And how was lunch yesterday?” The queen asked Rio as she sat on her bed, lacing up her black and white <em>Wales Bonner X Adidas Samba’s<em>. She’d added an ‘I heart NY’ pin to her left shoe and a silver dragonfly to the right.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Fine,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Good to hear. Do you like Mateo?”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I literally said about five words to him.<em> “He’s not really…like him how?” Rio asked instead.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“You know what I mean, Rio-Sofia. He is the first out of five potential candidates whom you might want to wed.”<br/>
</p><p>“Wed?” Rio spluttered. “What?! Mother, I’m twenty and gay!”<br/>
</p><p>“You won’t marry them now. You still have a couple of years,” she’d ignored the last part of Rio’s statement. “You have a lunch each week for the next four. You’re lucky, Rio-Sofia.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed.<br/>
</p><p>“You are. I didn’t get five options,” the queen continued.<br/>
</p><p>Was Rio supposed to be thankful that her mother was letting her pick from five <em>men<em>? When Rio didn’t like men, period?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“What if I don’t go?” Rio pushed back because what in the actual fuck.<br/>
</p><p>“Then you’re not coming back to Spain,” her mother stated simply.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you serious?” Rio almost yelled.<br/>
</p><p>“Deadly. So, how was the date from one to ten?”<br/>
</p><p>“A zero,” Rio replied before she hung up the phone.<br/>
</p><p>Now, technically, that was a lie. Minus Mateo, the date with <em>Agatha<em> was an eleven. Rio felt like she actually knew her a little now. Before it was purely attraction, observation and a mutual hate. But now…<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio knew she’d been playing hockey since she was eleven, her favourite colour was purple (Rio actually already knew this, but it was nice to have the confirmation), she had a weird thing about lavender, and she’d learnt Spanish for fourteen years at least.<br/>
</p><p>She also discovered that although Agatha was right-handed, she used her cutlery as if she were left; she appeared to like butter after the healthy amount of it she would add to her slices of bread, and she can’t go a few mouthfuls without having a drink of something.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was also <em>flirting<em>. Which she knew she had started doing, but at lunch? The soup stuff? The leg stuff? Rio had not been prepared for that. She almost shattered into a million pieces the first time she felt Agatha’s foot on her ankle. She almost combusted when her shoe lifted up her jeans, and she felt Agatha’s bare leg against her bare shin.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio thought she wasn’t going to be able to continue with the lunch until she remembered…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>…Wait. I can do that too.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>And she did.<br/>
</p><p>Teasing Agatha was almost as fun as being teased herself. The cherry on top of the cake was when their super-hot waitress came, and Rio jumped in to flirt with her before Agatha could. To see the brunette squirm in her seat as Rio did so was something she wouldn’t be forgetting anytime soon.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio opened the door to find Agatha behind it. She was wearing a body fitting white tank top that had a red lace bra poking out the top and sides, along with some wide leg baggy grey Nike sweatpants. The black leather <em>Longchamp<em> bag Rio had gotten her on her shoulder. She’d added a gold ‘A’ keychain to the zip as well as a small purple plastic bunny.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Her hair was down, and she was wearing those damn glasses.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, for fucksake.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was so fucked.<br/>
</p><p>“You ready for the library?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, going to retrieve her own uni bag, phone and water bottle before joining Agatha outside her room.<br/>
</p><p>“Can we walk?” Agatha asked. “I know you have to be driven everywhere, but the British Library is down the street, and I could use the fresh air.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio turned to Lucia, “¿Por favor, Cia?”<br/>
</p><p>Lucia huffed before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Vamos.” <em>Go on.<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio hugged her. “¡Muchas gracias!”<br/>
</p><p>“De nada,” Lucia replied through a laugh. “I’ll be walking behind you the entire time, though.”<br/>
</p><p>“Eso está bien.” <em>That’s okay.<em> Rio replied.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Vale.” <em>Okay.<em> Agatha replied at the same time.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio and Lucia stared at her. Yes, she now knew Agatha spoke Spanish, but she wasn’t expecting her to start whipping it out. Why was her accent almost perfect? Rio would still be able to tell she was British, her accent too strong to ever actually be concealed, but it was a close second.<br/>
</p><p>“Shall we go then?” Agatha asked when they had stared at her for a moment too long.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio smiled. “Let’s go.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The weather was nippy as expected at a quarter to eleven in London during autumn. Rio had on black vintage windbreaker <em>Adidas<em> bottoms (and yes, she was very happy that the stripe coordinated with her shoes), her favourite t-shirt that her mother would murder her if she knew she owned, it was light blue and had ‘Father Figure’ written over the bust. And a dark grey Carhart hoodie because it was five degrees, and she wasn’t cold-blooded like Agatha appeared to be.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You’re not cold?” Rio asked her as they stepped into the library.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Nope. You’re in England now, princess, get used to it,” she grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>Billy had texted them that he’d found a table on the first floor. As Agatha navigated her way around the large space, evidently having been there before, Rio had to stop to take it all in. She would always be in awe of libraries. They were spaces filled to the brim with facts and tales. A place for people to learn as much as their heart and brain would allow them to.<br/>
</p><p>Libraries, in Rio’s opinion, were just as powerful as an armoury. Why else are they always targeted first during wars?<br/>
</p><p>She looked up at the wall of books concealed behind glass that reached the ceiling. It was-<br/>
</p><p>“Beautiful, right?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio turned to Agatha, who was standing next to her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah, it is.”<br/>
</p><p>The two just stood there for a moment, staring at the books.<br/>
</p><p>“If I could,” Agatha spoke moments later. “I would read every book in this place.”<br/>
</p><p>“Would you want some company?” Rio replied before she could stop herself.<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes glanced at her before returning to the books. “Yes.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched.<br/>
</p><p>“Just not yours,” Agatha continued with a smirk before she walked off.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was full-blown smiling now as she followed the other girl up the steps and towards Billy.<br/>
</p><p>He lit up when he saw them, shuffling his textbooks around so that the places in front of the empty chairs were cleared.<br/>
</p><p>“Morning,” he whisper yelled.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grunted, and Rio replied with her own good morning.<br/>
</p><p>Billy pulled out the crinkled piece of paper with the question on it and placed it in the centre of the table.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s get to work then,” he grinned.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Now, Rio was <em>supposed<em> to be working. Reading through her texts and lecture notes to help her focus her analysis on the offences and defences of the case.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>But there was a teeny tiny little problem…<br/>
</p><p>Agatha ran her hand down the side of her neck in a back-and-forth motion. Her long hair falling over her right shoulder as she bit down on her pen, her glasses framing her blue eyes running down the length of the textbook she was reading.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Focus.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio blinked.<br/>
</p><p>Yes. She should be focusing. She returned her gaze to her textbook…momentarily. Her eyes drifted back to the brunette.<br/>
</p><p>She watched as Agatha jotted notes down on her notepad. Her long, slender fingers curled around the pen as she wrote. Rio could see the veins shooting up her hand as she tensed it to write. She couldn’t help but wonder what those fingers might feel like inside-<br/>
</p><p>“Are you okay, Rio-Sofia?” Billy asked her.<br/>
</p><p>She almost jumped out of her skin.<br/>
</p><p>“Jesus, you scared me,” Rio told him, her hand over her heart.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“By asking you if you’re okay…?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Rio defended. “The library’s quiet, so when you spoke, I wasn’t expecting it.”<br/>
</p><p>“Right…” Billy said sceptically. “I was just asking because you haven’t written anything, and we’ve been here for nearly an hour now.”<br/>
</p><p>That couldn’t be true. Rio looked down, and lo and behold, it was true. What the hell had she been doing this entire time (staring at Agatha)?<br/>
</p><p>“No, I have,” Rio replied weakly. “I’ve just been…reading.”<br/>
</p><p>“Okay…” Billy continued in his same sceptical tone. “I’m going outside for a vape break. Does anyone want to come?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head, and Agatha waved him off.<br/>
</p><p>“Alright then,” Billy said and left.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay over there, darlin?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>And she just had to call her that when Rio was already in heat.<br/>
</p><p>She leaned towards her, and the straps of her top and bra fell off her shoulder. Of course, Agatha didn’t bother pulling them up.<br/>
</p><p>“Wow. You really haven’t written anything.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was so close now Rio could tell she’d recently washed her hair. Fruity fragrances wafted up her nose, and she had to stop herself from sighing obnoxiously loud because of it.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, what’s the issue?” Agatha asked as she climbed onto the chair next to her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio could feel her body heat now, could see the goosebumps along her arms…which was strange because she wasn’t supposed to be cold.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you struggling with?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Agatha laughed. “I’m not getting a shitty grade because you aren’t doing any work.”<br/>
</p><p>How does one tell the girl they’re crushing on that they don’t in fact need any help and would be fine if they just put a bin bag over their head?<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows in amusement when Rio didn’t reply.<br/>
</p><p>“Hm,” she hummed as she studied Rio’s face.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, how desperately she wanted to turn away from her and look at anything else. But she couldn't otherwise, she would’ve lost. It would be mortifying to lose like this, considering Agatha hadn’t even flirted or touched her.<br/>
</p><p>She’d just sat and looked pretty…<em>literally.<br/>
</em></p><p>“Oh!” Agatha said as if she’d come to the realisation. She slid her hand along Rio’s thigh until she gripped it, and Rio’s leg jumped involuntarily. “Fucking knew it,” Agatha muttered victoriously. “It’s me, isn’t? I’m distracting you, huh?”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio replied petulantly. Here is where she would’ve slapped Agatha’s hand away, but if she did that, she would just be proving her point.<br/>
</p><p>Instead, Rio had to sit and try to ignore the tight knot twisting in her core.<br/>
</p><p>“I haven’t even started messing with you yet, and I’ve been affecting you <em>this<em> much?” Agatha laughed. “Do I have you wrapped around my finger, Rio-Sofia?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>Yes.<em> “No,” Rio snapped.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha moved her hand dangerously higher up Rio’s thigh.<br/>
</p><p>Thank god there were only a few people around. This behaviour was not appropriate for a public library.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s lips brushed the shell of Rio’s ear when she whispered in a sing-song voice:<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t believe you. I bet you’re dripping for me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s entire body went rigid at Agatha’s words.<br/>
</p><p>Damn. She was losing badly.<br/>
</p><p>Rio leaned in from where Agatha had pulled back, their noses almost touching, before Rio whispered into Agatha’s ear:<br/>
</p><p>“I am. Would you like to feel just how much?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha jerked her head back, eyes blinking rapidly.<br/>
</p><p>Andddd…Rio Vidal was back.<br/>
</p><p>Why deny when you can just be brutally honest, right? Why allow yourself to be teased when you can just get railed if you’re bold enough? Why <em>not<em> tell the beautiful brunette that she is in fact, correct and that you are dripping for her to throw her off guard.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“What’s the matter, baby?” Rio asked patronisingly as Agatha continued to blink at her. “Did I not follow the script?”<br/>
</p><p>She felt Agatha’s grip tighten around her thigh.<br/>
</p><p>“Or, we could skip to the next scene and find the closest bathroom before we violate a couple laws all having to do with public indecency.” Rio dropped her gaze to Agatha’s twitching fingers that were inches away from brushing against her core.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snatched her hand away.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio whined. “Put it back, I liked it there!” Rio teased.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck you,” Agatha snapped. “You’re not going to know what’s hit you when I’m through with you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Can’t wait,” Rio grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Billy returned then, and good because Rio was certain Agatha was seconds away from biting her head off.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>To put it lightly…Agatha was pissed.<br/>
</p><p>Not only had she lost yesterday, she had just lost again! They weren’t even supposed to be playing yet. She actually was trying to get her work done. But then Rio-Sofia had to sit there and get all flustered over Agatha doing absolutely nothing. And then Agatha had to mess with her, and then Rio-Sofia had to one-up her again!<br/>
</p><p>Now, Agatha was fuming and cold because the library was bloody freezing.<br/>
</p><p>She tapped her foot incessantly as she tried to return to her work. The princess seemed to be working perfectly fine now. She’d filled four pages of her A4 notepad, whereas thirty minutes ago it was blank.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t focus.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia looked up from where she had been reading her laptop, and Agatha swore to whoever that if the princess said anything even remotely teasing, she was going to slap her.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you want my jumper?”<br/>
</p><p>That…that wasn’t teasing.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re shivering and have been for the past half an hour,” Rio-Sofia continued.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha should say no. If she admitted to being cold, then it’d be taking back her words from earlier. And what about Rio-Sofia? Wouldn’t she be cold?<br/>
</p><p>
<em>You’re not supposed to care about that.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Right.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Give it,” Agatha demanded.<br/>
</p><p>The princess smiled before shrugging off her dark grey <em>Carhart<em> hoodie and handing it to her. Agatha made a point to not thank Rio-Sofia as she pulled the hoodie over her head and settled it on her body.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>It was warm with Rio-Sofia’s body heat and smelt like her. Vanilla, sandalwood and something nutty filled Agatha’s nostrils along with…was that honey?<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, for fucksake.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha pulled the sleeves halfway up her hands, and when she did, she noticed the little ‘R.V.’ sewn with green thread on the right cuff. Was that some type of mandatory royal thing? All their clothes had to be labelled?<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Or just a Rio-Sofia thing. She did say she liked to sew. It’s really well done, actually.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Stop it.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Her brain kept doing that. Remembering things that Rio-Sofia had told her yesterday at lunch. Wanda had been wearing a red top when she came to see her last night, and she immediately thought, <em>Oh, like Rio-Sofia’s favourite car racing team.<br/>
</em></p><p>She’d started cutting up a cucumber for her dinner and Agatha had thought, <em>Green, like Rio-Sofia’s favourite colour.<br/>
</em></p><p>It was becoming a problem.<br/>
</p><p>“Is it warm enough?” Rio-Sofia asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked up at her, a scowl on her face, until her gaze dropped to the princess’s shirt. ‘Father figure’ was written across it.<br/>
</p><p>Why was that the hottest thing Agatha had ever seen her in?<br/>
</p><p>She shoved the thought away to get out a grumbled:<br/>
</p><p>“No.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia laughed. “Well, it’s all I’ve got. So, deal with it or give it back.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned away from her, that being a response in itself. She saw the princess shake her head in her peripheral, saw her do that stupidly hot tongue thing.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was ready to go home now.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Two hours and a silent ten-minute walk home later, Agatha was back at home. She’d locked in for the last hour and a half at the library, blanking the princess out completely (partially).<br/>
</p><p>“In here,” Alice called from the kitchen when Rio-Sofia let them into their flat.<br/>
</p><p>The two girls and Lucia made their way to the kitchen, where Alice, Jen, Natasha and Wanda were sitting around the island.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda smiled at her when she saw her, and Natasha smiled at Rio-Sofia.<br/>
</p><p>“I haven’t seen you in days,” Natasha told the princess as she turned in her chair to hug her.<br/>
</p><p>“You saw me on Wednesday, Nat,” Rio-Sofia replied as they hugged.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes…which was days ago.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia laughed, pulling away as Agatha felt Wanda’s arm wrap around her waist. She suppressed the urge to pull away.<br/>
</p><p>“We were thinking about going out tonight,” Jen told them. “What do you think?”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, you know I’m always down for a night out,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia shook her head. “I can’t go out again. I got lucky last time. I don’t think I should risk it again. Plus,” she turned to Alice. “With the new sowing kit you got me, I can entertain myself for hours.” She smiled. “You guys have fun.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice turned to Lucia. “¿Cia, por favor? Nosotros cuidaremos de ella.” <em>Cia, please? We will look after her.<em> Alice pleaded.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Lucia pressed her lips into a tight line. Her eyes darted around the table of girls.<br/>
</p><p>“Hablé con Carlos, y me dijo-” <em>I spoke to Carlos, and he told me-<em> Alice continued before Lucia cut her off.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Ah!”<br/>
</p><p>The princess furrowed her eyebrows. “¿Qué te dijo mi hermano?” <em>What did my brother tell you?<br/>
“</em></p><p>Do you all promise to keep an eye out for her?” Lucia addressed the girls.<br/>
</p><p>They all nodded, and Lucia locked eyes with Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Lo prometes?” <em>Do you promise?<em> She was speaking to Agatha and Agatha alone.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>For some reason, Agatha felt the need to swallow. “Sí.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda’s grip tightened around her waist, drawing her closer.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay then. You can go out <em>just<em> once,” Lucia told them.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The girls squealed and clapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait, what are you going to wear?” Alice asked her.<br/>
</p><p>All the girls broke out into a conversation about what they were going to wear.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha, however, kept quiet. She was plotting.<br/>
</p><p>If Rio-Sofia wasn’t a whining mess by the end of tonight, then Agatha had failed.<br/>
</p><p>She wasn’t doing that again.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha’s plan was going swimmingly.<br/>
</p><p>Firstly, whilst she was making dinner, she <em>accidentally<em> dropped her wooden spoon on the floor when she was stirring her pasta. She picked it up in the sluttiest way possible giving Rio-Sofia a full view of her ass as she did so (she was wearing the shortest shorts known to man).<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Secondly, she announced that she was going to be wearing a red one-shoulder top and mini skirt out tonight. She described it in full detail so that Rio-Sofia knew exactly which skirt she was referring to. A simple black skirt that sat low-waisted on her hips and could probably pass as a belt (there’s no point wearing a mini skirt if it could <em>not<em> pass as a belt). She also made a joke about the ‘easy access’ Rio-Sofia had spoken about the other day.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Lastly, and this truly was by accident. She’d gone out of her room in just her lacy purple underwear and top because Jen had borrowed said mini skirt and she needed it back. It was only a quick trip, so she didn’t bother putting on more clothes. Rio-Sofia to Agatha’s luck was leaving Alice’s room as she entered the hallway, and Agatha had to hold back a laugh at the way her jaw dropped to the floor.<br/>
</p><p>Now they were at pres on the sofas in their flat, and Agatha had made a point to sit next to the princess. They were a couple of drinks in, and Agatha had started to let her hands wander. Just a graze of an elbow here and a hand on a thigh as she leaned over to grab her drink there.<br/>
</p><p>They were playing twenty-one questions (the drinking version where every time you said a number, you had to drink (so they were drinking all the time)).<br/>
</p><p>“Twenty-one,” Rio-Sofia said, taking a sip of vodka squash. “Give it to me.”<br/>
</p><p>“I have a question,” Agatha announced immediately.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…I’m not sure that’s a good idea,” Alice told her. “You know…because of the last time.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Natasha chimed in. “You’re not gonna be bitch to Ri again, are you?”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Ri. When the fuck did she start calling her that?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha waved them off. “It’s harmless. Just normal drinking game questions. What do you say, Rio-Sofia?” Agatha asked, leaning into her so their arms touched.<br/>
</p><p>“Go on.”<br/>
</p><p>“Who was the last person you slept with?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wanted to know…for research purposes…<br/>
</p><p>The princess shifted, pulling away from her so they were no longer touching.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…I haven’t…I mean not properly. I’ve only given, not received,” the princess said awkwardly.<br/>
</p><p>Now <em>that<em> was interesting information.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“What?” Natasha asked, surprised. “I wouldn’t have thought that.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia shrugged. “Not by choice obviously. It’s the whole princess of Spain thing,” she quipped.<br/>
</p><p>“Ah,” Natasha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“And who was the person?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“You only get one question,” Rio-Sofia smirked, leaning back into her.<br/>
</p><p>“Why do you want to know, Aggs?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Sometimes, Jennifer, a question is just a question.”<br/>
</p><p>“Right,” Jen replied, clearly not believing her.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay! I’m starting,” Wanda interrupted.<br/>
</p><p>She started counting again, and Agatha was churning over this new piece of information. This was <em>good<em> stuff. She knew what it felt like to be in heat and not be able to do anything about it. Up until a few weeks ago, she’d have to watch pretty girls walk by and leave it at that when she was foaming at the mouth for them. She’d have to go without the touch of a woman because she was in her small shitty down in the closest with her mother watching her every move.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>That wasn’t her anymore, but that was <em>still<em> Rio-Sofia.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>All those times they’d spent teasing each other, Agatha had outlets to find her release. Wanda, a random girl she picked up at a club or on campus. But Rio…sorry, Rio-Sofia, had no one except her own fingers and maybe a vibrator.<br/>
</p><p>So, the more Agatha pushed, the more desperate the princess would become because she had no other outlet. It was Agatha or no one.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt as if this new power she’d acquired was radiating off of her. A purple glow (purple because if Agatha had magical powers, she swore they’d be her favourite colour) that emitted from her entire body.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, this is gonna be fun.<em> She thought as she pressed up even more on Rio-Sofia.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>Agatha was going to push her until she shattered.<br/>
</p><p>More drinks and games later, Rio-Sofia announced she needed to go to the toilet.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll come,” Agatha said as she shuffled past Jen to get out.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” the princess replied as she started to leave the kitchen. “Your room or mine?”<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s go to yours,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>She’d never actually been inside the princess's room, only seen it from the door.<br/>
</p><p>Lucia asked them if they were okay when they approached her door, and when they told her they were fine, Rio-Sofia let them inside.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll just be a sec,” Rio-Sofia told her, unlocking her bathroom door.<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t want me to come in? I need to wee too, you know.”<br/>
</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. “Why? Are we gonna hold hands whilst we go?”<br/>
</p><p>“Could do,” Agatha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>The princess rolled her eyes. “Just stay out here, I’ll be quick.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t argue; this was the perfect time to snoop.<br/>
</p><p>She was unsurprised that Rio-Sofia’s bedsheets were her favourite colour. On her windowsill was an array of plants and flowers. Agatha didn’t know if it was because she was drunk why the fact that a pot of lavender was amongst them made her feel like she was going to throw up. She turned away from it quickly to stop that from happening.<br/>
</p><p>Her eyes landed on Rio-Sofia’s photo wall. She drew closer, her eyes darting across the cluster of photos. She spotted Alice in most of them, it was either a photo of just the two of them or with some other girls, seemingly their friends from Spain. In every photo, the princess was smiling. That real smile Agatha saw back at the pub on initiation night.<br/>
</p><p>She’d seen it more now, that real smile. It often appeared when the princess was around her. Agatha’s eyes stopped on the photo next to the one of her and Alice on what appeared to be a ski trip. It was Rio-Sofia and her two siblings.<br/>
</p><p>Upon first glance, it was a professional photo of them in their best. They looked like the royal family they were meant to be, tailored designer clothing with crowns and tiaras atop their heads. But the closer you looked, you could see each of the Vidal’s were discreetly flipping the camera person off.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia’s brother had his finger pressed against the side of his leg as his arm was limp by his side. Rio-Sofia’s was on her arm as they were folded on her stomach, and the princess’s little sister had hers on her belly, her hands planted on either side of her hips.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s my favourite photo,” the princess said, announcing her return.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha jumped; she’d been so intrigued by the photo she hadn’t heard her. She cleared her throat.<br/>
</p><p>“I can see why. I bet the queen was real happy when she saw this.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia smiled. “She grounded us for a month, but I think it was worth it.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha found herself smiling too…until she realised…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>…Wait, hold on.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She blinked before returning to her scheme. She took Rio-Sofia’s hand and used it to point at a random photo on the board. She heard the princess’s breath hitch, and she tried and failed to stifle her smirk.<br/>
</p><p>“Tell me about this one.”<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…”<br/>
</p><p>Their faces were so close now as Agatha stared at Rio-Sofia, her arm the only thing stopping their faces from touching altogether.<br/>
</p><p>“That was me, Alice and some of our friends back home at…”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha started flicking her eyes slowly between the princess’s.<br/>
</p><p>“…At…erm…my brother’s birthday party. Our mother…”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha bit her lip with a nod, and Rio-Sofia swallowed.<br/>
</p><p>“…Erm…she lets him have a huge one every two years. They’re always a lot of fun.”<br/>
</p><p>“Do you ever get one? A party, I mean.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared at her for a moment, her big brown eyes looking at her as if she were the most beautiful thing in the world.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” the princess replied quietly.<br/>
</p><p>And suddenly, Agatha felt sorry for her.<br/>
</p><p>“How come?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia shrugged. “Second in line means you don’t get parties.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah.”<br/>
</p><p>They continued to stare at each other, Agatha’s hand still on Rio’s. It was soft and warm, and Agatha didn’t mind holding it.<br/>
</p><p>A loud knock at the door had her snatching her hand away.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs, Rio-Sofia? You done?” Wanda called. “We’re thinking of leaving now.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t need to pee?” Rio-Sofia asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Nope,” Agatha told her with a grin before pushing past her.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>They were going back the club from initiation night. One, it was only in Kings Cross so they could walk and didn’t have to get the tube. And two, Natasha told them it was 2010s night, meaning they were only playing music from that era. It perfect. The rush of nostalgia, plus messing with the princess meant that Agatha was in for a good night.<br/>
</p><p>She was trapped with Wanda as they walked, Rio-Sofia in front of her with Natasha, their arms wrapped around each other’s waists like the last time. Why? Agatha didn’t know. Wanda and Natasha were getting in the way of her scheming.<br/>
</p><p>“Does anyone have a fag?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha parted her lips to reply when Jen said:<br/>
</p><p>“As in a cigarette. I don’t wanna hear any more of your jokes,” her best friend scolded her.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re no fun, Jen,” Agatha whined as Jen flipped her off.<br/>
</p><p>“I do, wanna share?” Alice replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Please.”<br/>
</p><p>“Can I have one too, please, Al?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Course.”<br/>
</p><p>As they stopped for Alice to fish out her cigarettes, Agatha noticed the lace of Natasha’s right navy blue Samba was coming undone. She strategically untangled herself from Wanda and edged closer to her to step on her shoe lace. When Natasha shifted, the lace undid itself completely.<br/>
</p><p>She walked closer to Alice to hide her smirk.<br/>
</p><p>“Here you go,” Alice said, handing her the cigarette. “I can’t find my lighter one sec.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve got one,” Rio-Sofia replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Perfect,” Agatha said, walking up to her, the cigarette in her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia shielded the end with her hand as she lit it with her lighter. Agatha noticed it was a deep green and had a gold spider etched on the front. The lighter looked very cool and very expensive, and it came to no surprise to her that the princess owned it.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia lit it, and Agatha inhaled, the bitter yet delicious smoke filling her mouth until she breathed it out, throwing her head back. The nicotine shot to her head immediately, adding fuel to her alcohol buzz.<br/>
</p><p>“You want?” She offered her cigarette to the princess.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia nodded and allowed Agatha to press it to her lips, her fingers ghosting over them.<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve never shared a cigarette with me,” Wanda complained. “You literally told me you don’t like sharing them.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“Alright, let’s go,” Alice said once she and Jen had their cigarette lit.<br/>
</p><p>They started walking, and Natasha told them her lace was undone and if they could wait. Agatha pretended she hadn’t heard, sticking her free hand in Rio-Sofia’s jean pocket to keep her walking.<br/>
</p><p>The princess tensed before her body relaxed into it, her hip pressing into Agatha’s.<br/>
</p><p>“You ever done blow backs?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Do pigs fly?” The princess replied sarcastically.<br/>
</p><p>She grinned. “Do one with me,” she ordered.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia nodded.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha inhaled before leaning into her. Rio-Sofia brought her lips to hers and allowed her to blow smoke into them. Agatha let their lips touch, that sweet-tasting lip gloss she remembered the princess wearing the first time she kissed her coating the edge of her lips.<br/>
</p><p>She passed the smoke through them and pulled away. The princess inhaled the smoke from Agatha’s mouth before she grinned.<br/>
</p><p>“Thought we weren’t doing that again.”<br/>
</p><p>“Calm down, our lips barely grazed.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia’s grin never wavered. “They might as well have.”<br/>
</p><p>“Guys!” Jen yelled. “Are you two fucking deaf? We said to wait. Nat had to do her shoe lace up.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, sorry! We didn’t hear you,” Agatha lied.<br/>
</p><p>The other girls caught up to them.<br/>
</p><p>“Get your ears cleaned,” her best friend told her.<br/>
</p><p>If Agatha wasn’t holding a cigarette in one hand and had the other in Rio-Sofia’s pocket, she would’ve flipped her off.<br/>
</p><p>They continued towards the club, Agatha sharing her cigarette with the princess until it ran out, her thumb stroking back and forth on her ass in her jeans pocket. She felt Rio-Sofia twitching against her and just knew she was driving her insane.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had never felt prouder of herself in her life.<br/>
</p><p>Once at the club, Rio-Sofia bought them a round of tequila shots. When every girl had necked theirs, they made their way to the dance floor.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey,” Wanda said, pulling on her arm before she could follow Rio-Sofia onto the dance floor. “Are you okay? Are you and Rio-Sofia arguing again?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows with a laugh. Did they look like they were fighting?<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, yeah. We’ve been arguing all day.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda deadpanned. “I’m being serious. You can talk to me if you are, and we can stay away from her.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed again. “Shut up, Wanda and let’s dance. Kay?” She took the redhead's hand and pulled her forward.<br/>
</p><p>When they got onto the dance floor, <em>Justin Bieber’s Boyfriend<em> had just started playing.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Wanda wrapped her arms around her neck, and they started moving. Agatha locked eyes with Rio-Sofia just ahead, who was dancing with Natasha, Jen and Alice next to them.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t know if it was the strobe lights or the fact that she was drunk why the princess looked…pretty? Prettier than usual. They kept eye contact as they danced with their partners, Rio-Sofia’s lips lifting into a smirk as Natasha held onto her.<br/>
</p><p>The chorus dropped, and Natasha spun Rio-Sofia around. Agatha took this as the perfect opportunity to duck under Wanda’s shoulder and catch the princess before she could spin into Natasha again. She slammed into her, and Rio-Sofia’s eyes widened until she realised who had caught her.<br/>
</p><p>The princess rolled her eyes before Agatha turned her around so that her back was pressed against her, her hand falling to Rio-Sofia’s hip. She was wearing a black backless top, so Agatha’s hand rested on bare, heated skin.<br/>
</p><p>It took mere moments for the princess to start shifting her hips, her ass brushing against Agatha’s core as she used her hand to guide the princess’s movement.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt…tingly…?<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia pushed back further, her hand coming up to grip Agatha’s neck, her hand tangling in her hair.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha felt the new stickiness of her underwear. She bit her lip. She couldn’t get turned on. That defeated the whole purpose of messing with the princess.<br/>
</p><p>She used the hand on Rio-Sofia’s hip to spin her back around, hand running across her exposed back, so they were facing each other again. It was as if Rio knew because the grin she was wearing was shit eating.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha fought the urge to roll her eyes, placing her free hand on Rio-Sofia’s other hip and drawing her closer. She was to carry on as usual because this, dancing with the princess, was not affecting her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia wrapped her hands around her neck as they moved to the music.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Girlfriend, girlfriend. You could be my girlfriend,<em>” JB said in his song.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>Girlfriend? I wonder what it would be like to be a princess’s girlfriend.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Stop. It.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha was drunk. She couldn’t care less what it would be like to be a princess’s girlfriend. She wasn’t interested in any princesses.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia lifted her hands off her neck, stepped back, and the next thing Agatha knew, Wanda was there again. <em>Why?<em> Could Wanda not see that she was scheming?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha tried not to let her irritation show as the redhead latched onto her once more.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s go dance with the girls,” Agatha told her, before twisting out of Wanda’s grasp and dragging her towards their group.<br/>
</p><p>The circle they had created opened up and thank fuck Agatha found herself next to the princess again.<br/>
</p><p>The song had gotten to the slow part, and Jen, Alice, Natasha and Rio-Sofia were screaming the lyrics to the top of their lungs before the last chorus dropped.<br/>
</p><p>Before Natasha could even think about grabbing onto Rio again, Agatha swooped in, readjusting them to their previous position. Although Rio didn’t put her hands around her neck again. Nope, instead, she started trailing both hands along Agatha’s body.<br/>
</p><p>She started from her neck, running her hand across her bare shoulder, down her chest, down her stomach. All while Agatha swayed their hips.<br/>
</p><p>In the end, Agatha leaned her head forward so that their foreheads touched. Rio drew her in by her neck, her warm hands pressing into her skin, their lips so close Agatha could feel her breath.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio started smiling, Agatha found herself smiling too, a laugh floating out of her lips. Rio’s giggle joined it. Agatha pulled her impossibly closer, and Rio did the same, her thumb stroking against her neck.<br/>
</p><p>Once the song ended, Rio pulled away, her hand dropping to Agatha’s arm, tugging her.<br/>
</p><p>They left the dance floor, went up the crowded flight of stairs and into the bathroom of their first kiss. Rio-Sofia locked the door and spun on her.<br/>
</p><p>“Kiss me,” she demanded.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Is that what you want?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, otherwise I wouldn’t have said it,” the princess snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Hm,” Agatha hummed, nudging Rio backwards until she was pressed against the door.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched as Agatha dipped her head. She pulled Rio’s bottom lip into her mouth before she bit it. Not hard enough to draw blood, but hard enough that the princess whimpered, her body shuddering. Agatha released it with a smirk before she soothed the bite by running her tongue over her lip. It dipped into the princess’s mouth, and Agatha withdrew before she did something stupid like kiss her.<br/>
</p><p>Like usual, Rio tasted divine.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha breathed against her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“No?” Rio asked in alarm.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I told you; we’re never doing that again.”<br/>
</p><p>“But,” the princess spluttered. “Why not?!”<br/>
</p><p>“I know you want me to, which makes me <em>not<em> want to do it.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio blinked at her. “But…<em>please<em>,” she got out desperately.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Are you begging, Rio-Sofia?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes.”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, I never. The princess of Spain begging little old me to kiss her. What would everyone say?”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t care! Kiss. Me.” Rio demanded again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Not even a please. What has the world come to?”<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck you,” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“I bet you want me to, huh?” Agatha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio huffed before shoving Agatha away from her and storming out of the bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>Point Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>There had been a role reversal.<br/>
</p><p>It wasn’t like the last time Rio had left that bathroom. She had come out on top. Agatha was spiralling, and Rio had never felt so smug in her life. Now, it was Rio’s turn to spiral.<br/>
</p><p>All night, Agatha had been toying with her, but she’d held on because she figured it would end how it had the last time they got drunk together. They’d end up making out in that shitty toilet. But no. Agatha had denied her.<br/>
</p><p>She ran back onto the dance floor and made her way to where she had last left the girls.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay?” Natasha asked her when she was close enough.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was not okay. She had a tight coil in her stomach that wouldn’t be moving any time soon.<br/>
</p><p>“Fine,” Rio replied, forcing a smile.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha came back then, a smirk on her face as she breezed past her. She tugged on Wanda’s arm, who was facing away from them, talking to one of her friends, spun her around and kissed her.<br/>
</p><p>She fucking kissed her right in front of Rio’s face as if she hadn’t been begging her to kiss her moments prior.<br/>
</p><p>How come Wanda got to kiss her just like that? Without having to work for it. Wanda just got to stand there, and Agatha would just kiss her as if it were the easiest thing in the world.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had to stop her jaw from hitting the floor.<br/>
</p><p>She squeezed her legs together, watching in horror as Agatha shoved her tongue down Wanda’s throat.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, fuck this.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Stop. Think before you do something stupid.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>But Rio didn’t think, her need for release overriding her common sense, overriding the fact that she was still the princess of Spain and could not be seen kissing a girl out in public.<br/>
</p><p>She grabbed Natasha by the arm and crashed their lips together.<br/>
</p><p>She felt the redhead tense before she relaxed into it. She pulled Rio in by the waist, her hand coming up to cradle her neck.<br/>
</p><p>Rio darted her tongue into Natasha’s mouth and hummed when the action was reciprocated.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fucking finally.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Release.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio pulled back, Natasha raised an eyebrow, but there was a smirk on her face that told Rio she didn’t hate what had just happened.<br/>
</p><p>She grinned. Natasha leaned in for another when a strong arm grabbed her and tugged.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t stop until they were off the dance floor and in an empty corridor at the front of the club.<br/>
</p><p>“Whose lips would you rather have? Mine or hers?” Agatha seethed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared at her for a moment before she finally said:<br/>
</p><p>“Yours.”<br/>
</p><p>“That’s what I thought. If you kiss anyone else tonight, I’m never touching you again. Are we clear?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio wanted to say, <em>Oh, so you can kiss other people, but I can’t?<br/>
</em></p><p>But she couldn’t say that. She needed to feel Agatha’s touch again, in any way possible.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Good-”<br/>
</p><p>“Are you the girl who fucked my girlfriend?” Some girl cut Agatha off.<br/>
</p><p>The two girls looked at their new company. It was a blonde girl who had a look on her face that Rio could only describe as murderous.<br/>
</p><p>“Who-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was cut off once more when the blonde punched her in the face.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened before she dragged Agatha behind her. “What the fuck?!”<br/>
</p><p>“You are you bitch! Don’t even try to deny it!”<br/>
</p><p>“Who the fuck even is your girlfriend?” Agatha shrieked, blood pouring out of her nose.<br/>
</p><p>“Izzy!” The blonde shouted.<br/>
</p><p>“Who – oh – her.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>There’s no fucking way she did that.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“She told me she was single. It’s not my fault your girlfriend lied,” Agatha shot back.<br/>
</p><p>The blonde lunged for her again, but a bouncer caught her before she could cause any more damage.<br/>
</p><p>“No fighting in my club! You’re all out,” he barked.<br/>
</p><p>“But it wasn’t us!” Rio protested.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t give a flying fuck. You’re all out!”</p>

<p>After they’d been kicked out of the club, Rio went to the closest food truck to ask for some ice for Agatha. She’d given it to her, and they’d made their way to <em>Coal Drops Yard<em> to sit at the steps by the River Thames.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Who the fuck is Izzy, Agatha?” Rio asked as the brunette pressed the ice wrapped in tissue paper against her bloody nose.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Some girl I fucked last week. She told me she was single.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow.<br/>
</p><p>“I swear! I would never fuck someone in a relationship. I always ask first. I’m messy, but I’m not <em>that<em> messy.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio nodded, turning her attention to the river and the brightly lit buildings of London beyond.<br/>
</p><p>After a while, Rio said:<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to text the girls what happened.” She patted her pocket for her phone, only to realise it wasn’t there. She checked her other pocket and found the same result. “Mierda.” <em>Shit.<br/>
</em></p><p>“What?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Eres una estúpida idiota.” <em>You stupid idiot<em>. Rio muttered under her breath.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“What?!” Agatha asked again.<br/>
</p><p>“I left my phone in the flat,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha said, disappointed that that was what Rio was so worried about. “Here,” she said, handing Rio her phone. “Use mine.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio sent their group chat a quick text before she gave it back.<br/>
</p><p>“Can you not leave me…please? It’s just…I don’t have a phone and I-”<br/>
</p><p>“You think I would leave you?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>She seemed almost…hurt? That Rio would imply such a thing.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shrugged, turning to face her.<br/>
</p><p>“Never, I would never leave you,” Agatha replied, holding her gaze.<br/>
</p><p>They stared at each other for a long moment until Agatha cleared her throat.<br/>
</p><p>“Or any girl alone by themselves,” she added. “I’m a bitch not a cunt.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed. “Noted.”<br/>
</p><p>Another beat passed before Rio asked:<br/>
</p><p>“How’s your nose?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha lifted the makeshift ice pack off her face to show her. It looked fine, nothing broken, just dried bits of blood here and there.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s alright. Hurts like a bitch.”<br/>
</p><p>“She got you good, huh?” Rio smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Evidently. I’m never fucking a girl again,” Agatha declared.<br/>
</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed with an eyeroll. “Shut up.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled, and they fell back into a somewhat comfortable silence.<br/>
</p><p>She returned to staring out at the murky water, her eyes tracking the odd car or cyclist riding past on the road just ahead.<br/>
</p><p>“Does…does my nose look okay?” Agatha asked quietly.<br/>
</p><p>Rio turned to face her again, and there was a look on Agatha’s face that Rio had never seen before.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>“No, I mean…does it <em>look<em> okay?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>And now Rio understood.<br/>
</p><p>“Your nose is perfect,” Rio answered honestly, because it was.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned away from her with a nod, replacing the ice pack on it.<br/>
</p><p>“My mother tells me it ruins my face,” Agatha admitted.<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked. One, because nothing could possibly ruin Agatha’s face. Two, no mother should ever say that to their child. And three, she was surprised Agatha would admit that to her.<br/>
</p><p>“Your mother doesn’t know what she’s talking about, then.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio realised then that their mothers might be similar. Although the queen had never said any of her features ruined her face, always telling her that if she kept scowling, it would take away from her beauty, her mother would comment on her size.<br/>
</p><p>It was no secret that Rio loved to eat during family meals with her dad’s side. Her Abuela was the best cook in the world in Rio’s opinion. She was the one who taught her how to cook and was the one who made her fall in love with it. On the rare occasion the royal family were allowed to visit her dad’s side in the south, her mother would always say:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>‘And watch it with the food, Rio-Sofia. You are a princess; you have standards to keep up with.’<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Of course, she’d never said the same to her brother.<br/>
</p><p>Luckily, it never stopped Rio. Her mother’s comments often rolled over her head, but she worried for her sister. Ana wasn’t old enough for those comments yet, but when she was, Rio was scared that she might not be able to ignore them the way she had.<br/>
</p><p>The silence stretched on for a while, neither girl having anything to say until:<br/>
</p><p>“Is it okay if we go home? I don’t think I want to be out anymore.” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s lips lifted into a smirk. “The notorious party girl wants to go home? Never thought I’d see the day.”<br/>
</p><p>“Hey!” Agatha shoved her playfully. “How do you know that? You weren’t here during freshers week.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, but I was there the week after. And Jen can’t keep her mouth shut,” Rio smiled, getting up.<br/>
</p><p>She offered her hand to Agatha, who hesitated before taking it and letting Rio pull her up.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to murder her,” Agatha replied as they began walking.<br/>
</p><p>They stopped by a bin so that she could dispose of her ice pack, and once Agatha had wiped away the remaining blood, they continued.<br/>
</p><p>“I still want a fag though,” Agatha said as they passed a group that appeared to be university students.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t have any, sorry,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>“No worries. I’ll get one.”<br/>
</p><p>Before Rio had a chance to ask what she meant, Agatha was sauntering over to the group. It took all but five seconds for three cigarettes to be shoved in her direction. She took all three, making Rio laugh.<br/>
</p><p>When she returned, Rio told her:<br/>
</p><p>“No wonder you got punched in the face; you’re a serial flirter.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “What can I say? When you have a gift, you use it to your advantage. How else do you think I got a princess to buy me an entire wardrobe?” Agatha smirked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio tutted. “You weren’t flirting with me then; you just hated me.”<br/>
</p><p>“Still do,” Agatha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Can I use your lighter again?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Sure,” Rio replied, fishing it out of her pocket.<br/>
</p><p>“Can I say I love how you remembered your lighter but forgot your phone.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed. “I had my priorities in order.”<br/>
</p><p>She looked down and noticed Agatha’s shoe lace was undone. Rio stooped without question to tie it.<br/>
</p><p>“You want?”<br/>
</p><p>When Rio looked up, Agatha was offering her cigarette again, even though Wanda had informed her that Agatha didn’t like sharing them. Not to mention, she had two spare that she’d put in her pocket.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, and Agatha pressed the cigarette into her mouth, her fingers grazing over Rio’s teeth as she took a drag. Rio had to stop herself from poking her tongue out to taste them. She wondered what Agatha’s fingers would taste like, what they would feel like if she could suck on them.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Stop it.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She was still drunk.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled the cigarette away, and Rio looked up at her through her eyelashes. She had never wanted to kiss someone so badly in her life. She wouldn’t ask again. She knew Agatha wouldn’t allow her to.<br/>
</p><p>The brunette stared down at her, and Rio didn’t miss the way her breath hitched before she put the cigarette back in her mouth. Rio smirked. It was nice to know that she was still affecting Agatha, even if the other girl wasn’t as willing to crumble as she was.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha flicked her gaze between Rio’s eyes before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“You done?”<br/>
</p><p>“With what?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>A smirk slid across Agatha’s lips. “With tying up my shoe?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked. Is that why she was down there?<br/>
</p><p>“Er…” she finished tying Agatha’s laces. “Yeah,” she said, standing up.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay then.”<br/>
</p><p>The two girls walked back to their accommodation, sharing two out of Agatha’s three cigarettes between them.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio knocked on the flat next door's front door and waited.<br/>
</p><p>She needed to talk to Natasha, to apologise for kissing her so abruptly, to make sure she hadn’t accidentally ruined their friendship. The relationship she’d built with Natasha over the past couple of days had become far more important to her than she ever would’ve imagined.<br/>
</p><p>Although they hadn’t seen each other since Thursday, they texted every day without fail. Rio found Natasha’s unwavering confidence addictive. In ways, she looked up to her because of it. It reminded her of Agatha. They were both so unapologetically, shamelessly themselves, every second of every day. Rio <em>wished<em> she could be like that.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She wasn’t allowed.<br/>
</p><p>Most of the time, she had to be Princess Rio-Sofia Vidal, second in line to the Spanish throne.<br/>
</p><p>The public-facing version of herself. The disingenuous version of herself.<br/>
</p><p>The door opened, and the wrong redhead was on the other side.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “Hi, Wanda. Is Nat in?”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda glared at her before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Nat! Rio-Sofia’s here.”<br/>
</p><p>“You can just call me Rio, Wanda,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>“Nah, Rio-Sofia’s just fine.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What’s up with her?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She opened her mouth to ask just that when Natasha opened her door.<br/>
</p><p>“Come on in, Ri.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio walked past Wanda, who was still glaring at her and made her way to Natasha’s room.<br/>
</p><p>The redhead let her in and offered her a seat on her bed.<br/>
</p><p>“To what do I owe the pleasure?” Natasha asked when she was settled.<br/>
</p><p>“I just came to see how your night went last night,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha smiled before she took up the place next to her. “Nobody else got punched if that’s what you’re asking.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio threw her head back and laughed. “I don’t know how she ends up in the situations she does.”<br/>
</p><p>“I can’t even judge her, I fear I’m just as bad,” Natasha replied.<br/>
</p><p>The two settled into a comfortable silence for a beat before Rio said:<br/>
</p><p>“Nat…I’m sorry about…about yesterday. I shouldn’t have kissed you.”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha quirked an eyebrow. “And why not?”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, I…” Rio stuttered. “I mean…I didn’t exactly warn you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Those are the best types of kisses, no? The unexpected ones?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio tilted her head in agreement.<br/>
</p><p>“So, do you like girls then?” Natasha asked, getting straight to the point and not beating around the bush.<br/>
</p><p>What could Rio say? She was <em>supposed<em> to say no. Deny, deny, deny, like the queen told her to. But this was Natasha.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Yes,” Rio answered.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha pointed at her. “Da! Bloody knew it!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m guessing that’s something you’re not supposed to tell people,” Natasha continued.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. “So, if you wouldn’t-”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha cut her off. “Ri, I’m not going to tell anyone. I promise.”<br/>
</p><p>“Thanks.”<br/>
</p><p>“It’s fucked your mum made you say all that shit then, though.”<br/>
</p><p>There had to be a better word than fucked. It was ridiculous, preposterous, absurd.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said quietly.<br/>
</p><p>“Thanks for telling me, Rio. And, if you ever want someone to kiss or…<em>more<em> then...” Natasha gestured to herself.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “You serious?”<br/>
</p><p>“Course. And before you ask, it won’t fuck up our friendship or any of that trivial shit,” Natasha continued.<br/>
</p><p>“Promise?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>Because she couldn’t lose this friendship with Natasha no matter how horny she was, or how much Agatha was driving her insane with all her relentless teasing.<br/>
</p><p>“Promise,” Natasha nodded.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>It’d been two weeks since Agatha had gotten punched, and in those two weeks she’d gotten…sluttier?<br/>
</p><p>It was the fucking Spanish princess’s fault.<br/>
</p><p>The pair hadn’t stopped teasing each other. It was nonstop: at hockey practice, during lectures, seminars, in their flat.<br/>
</p><p>Last Friday, during their group presentation, Rio-Sofia had purposely stood behind Agatha as she presented to the class. The princess was twirling the ends of Agatha’s hair, her fingers trailing patterns on her back. It had made her stutter on her words as her body came alive because of the electrifying, no, irritating sensation. She couldn’t even move away from her because she had to see the smart board she was reading off of.<br/>
</p><p>That wasn’t to say Agatha hadn’t gotten her back, though. She’d gone out of her way to always be in the kitchen when the princess was, always <em>accidentally<em> touching her, flirting with her. She never missed the way Rio-Sofia would subtly squeeze her legs together every time she did so.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>But because of the nonstop teasing, Agatha had needed to find release far more often. She was <em>constantly<em> horny.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Luckily, Rio-Sofia hadn’t been on a night out with them since that night two weeks ago. And Agatha thanked whoever because she was sure she would’ve snapped by now and they would’ve fucked. Now, Agatha was free to enjoy her nights out picking up random girls from the club and taking them home with her or vice versa.<br/>
</p><p>She made sure to triple-check that they weren’t in relationships first because she was not getting punched in the face again.<br/>
</p><p>She’d been seeking out Wanda less now too. The redhead had gotten…what was the word for it…clingy? Agatha didn’t do clingy.<br/>
</p><p>A knock at her door had Agatha groaning as she pulled herself out of bed. She was hungover and it was…12 PM. Wait…why was it 12 PM?<br/>
</p><p>The door opened to reveal Jen on the other side with a brown paper bag from <em>Gail’s Bakery.<br/>
</em></p><p>Her best friend raised an eyebrow as she took in her appearance. Agatha knew what she looked like. Messy hair, last night's makeup in her underwear and Rio-Sofia’s hoodie.<br/>
</p><p>A rustling in her room dragged Jen’s attention away from her as she laid eyes on another brunette scurrying about the place, picking up her belongings.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck!” The other brunette muttered. “I didn’t realise the time; I’ve got an appointment.”<br/>
</p><p>Once she was half dressed with her shoes on, she moved past Agatha and Jen.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll call you,” she told Agatha before she left.<br/>
</p><p>When their front door had shut, Jen raised an eyebrow again.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck boy Agatha makes her return tenfold then? What’s that…the fifth girl this week? And none of them being Wanda.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“You got me something from Gail’s? What is it?”<br/>
</p><p>Jen dangled the bag in front of her face, urging her to take it. When Agatha did, she smiled in delight.<br/>
</p><p>“A cinnamon roll? God, I love you,” Agatha told her, sinking her teeth in and walking into her room.<br/>
</p><p>“No, you love Rio.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha almost choked on her food.<br/>
</p><p>“She was the one who bought it for you,” Jen continued.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded, sitting on her bed.<br/>
</p><p>“Speaking of,” Jen said, sitting next to her. “What’s going on between you two?”<br/>
</p><p>“What do you mean?” Agatha replied around her mouthful.<br/>
</p><p>“The Saturday you got punched in the face? When you two were dancing? I was waiting for you to bring it up, but you never did.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Nothing. Friends can dance together, right?”<br/>
</p><p>“Agreed,” Jen nodded. “But you two aren’t friends. You were the one who told me that. Are you more?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had to swallow to stop herself from throwing up. “God, no, Jen. What the fuck?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m just saying…friends or <em>not friends<em> don’t act the way you two do,” her best friend shrugged.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I hate her,” Agatha stated.<br/>
</p><p>“Sureeee,” Jen replied. She stood. “Have a shower, Aggs and air out your room. You and it stink of sex.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha flipped her off as Jen went to leave.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Now, she wasn’t proud of it, but Agatha had spent the entire day napping and rotting in bed. It was only now, at half past midnight, that she’d left her room for the first time to fill up her water bottle in the kitchen. That’s when their front door opened and shut, and Rio-Sofia breezed into the room, a stupid smile on her face.<br/>
</p><p>“And where have you been?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia’s eyebrows lifted in amusement before she replied:<br/>
</p><p>“I was at Natasha’s, is that okay with you mom?”<br/>
</p><p>“Are you fucking?” Agatha asked, getting straight to the point.<br/>
</p><p>She wanted to know. Recently, the princess was always in the other flat. Why? For what possible reason?<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia’s lips twisted into a smirk. “Maybe.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “I thought I told you if you kissed anyone else, I would never touch you again.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia shook her head before taking the water jug by Agatha’s bottle to fill up her own. “No, you said if I kissed anyone else <em>tonight<em>, then you wouldn’t touch me again. That was two weeks ago.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Same rules still apply.”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t care,” Rio-Sofia answered simply.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Wait…hold on…what?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged nonchalantly. “Guess I’m never touching you again then.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia twisted the cap on her water bottle, taking her sweet, precious time with it.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wanted to hit her.<br/>
</p><p>When she looked up, the princess said:<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t believe you.”<br/>
</p><p>She walked closer to Agatha, just close enough that she could feel Rio-Sofia’s body heat radiating off her. Agatha forced herself to stay put.<br/>
</p><p>“I know you want me just as badly as I want you,” Rio-Sofia nodded to emphasise her point. “So, when you’re ready to acknowledge that fact, you know where to find me.”<br/>
</p><p>She leaned in until Agatha could feel her lips brush against the shell of her ear.<br/>
</p><p>“The room next to yours,” she said in a low, gravely voice that made Agatha’s core clench.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glared at her as Rio-Sofia smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Good night, Agatha,” the princess said, running her hand down her arm.<br/>
</p><p>She left Agatha alone in the kitchen, and she had to resist the urge to take Rio up on her offer, because she couldn’t…right?</p>

<p>As soon as Rio put her water bottle down on her bedside table after returning to her room, there was a knock at her door.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>There’s no way.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Apparently, there was.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was standing on the other side of the door. The brunette walked in without an invitation and shut the door behind her.<br/>
</p><p>“If we do this,” Agatha started. “I’m in control.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio grinned. “Okay.”<br/>
</p><p>“That easy, huh?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s grin never wavered. “I like giving you the illusion of control. I know you crave it. I maintain it in my own little way.”<br/>
</p><p>“What does that mean?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio closed the distance between them, putting her hand on Agatha's waist and drawing her closer.<br/>
</p><p>“Like this. I touch you, and you let me even though you want to fight me. Like how you let me kiss you and then told me <em>afterwards<em> that we’re never doing that again.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She moved her hand underneath Agatha’s tank top, so it rested on bare skin. When Agatha didn’t pull herself away or snatch Rio’s hand away, she watched her fingers stroke the skin just above Agatha’s underwear with a knowing smile.<br/>
</p><p>“See.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha yanked her chin up then, and Rio was forced to look at deep blue. Agatha’s thumb was pressed against her bottom lip, pulling.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had never been so turned on in her life. She watched Agatha with half-lidded eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m,” Agatha walked her backwards until she was flat against her bedroom wall. “In. Control.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio flicked her eyes between Agatha’s before she got out in a raspy voice, “Whatever you say, baby.”<br/>
</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s thumb was still on her bottom lip. She dragged it across Rio’s lip, her eyes fixated on the movement as if she were in a trance.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha’s eyes returned to Rio’s, she bit her own lip.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wanted to say something like she was losing control already, but she kept her mouth shut, enjoying the way they were getting lost in each other.<br/>
</p><p>“I crave you in every sense of the word,” Rio got out. “Your touch, your scent. I want it. I want you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Prove it then.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smirked before she used the hand on Agatha’s hip to guide her, replacing her body on the wall with Agatha’s.<br/>
</p><p>The brunette narrowed her eyes before she took her thumb off Rio’s lip, moving her hand to her shoulder before pushing Rio down to her knees.<br/>
</p><p>She went willingly, more than happy to kneel before the most beautiful girl she’d ever laid eyes on. Her hands trailed down the curve of Agatha’s body as she went until she stopped them, resting them on the waistband of Agatha’s sweatpants.<br/>
</p><p>Without breaking eye contact, Rio hooked her fingers in either side before she started shifting them down. She did it slowly, moving the piece of clothing an inch at a time on either leg.<br/>
</p><p>She could see Agatha getting impatient, which only made her move slower.<br/>
</p><p>“If you don’t hurry up, I’m leaving,” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smirked. “We both know you’re not going anywhere.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glared at her but didn’t say anything.<br/>
</p><p>When her sweatpants were just past her knees, Rio couldn’t help it. She leaned in and started kissing Agatha’s thigh. With so much exposed skin right in front of her eyes, how could she not?<br/>
</p><p>She alternated between each leg, planting one kiss on one and then planting another kiss on the other. All while she continued to pull her sweatpants down.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha kept twitching as she did so. Every time Rio’s lips touched her skin, the leg that had her attention would bounce.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was literally in succession for the Spanish throne, and yet she had never felt more powerful than in this moment.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s sweatpants hit the floor, and Rio tapped her ankle. “Step out of these for me, please, baby.”<br/>
</p><p>She was surprised when Agatha complied so easily, eager to rid herself of the clothing.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio’s eyes landed on Agatha’s underwear, she could see the dark patch on her light grey pants.<br/>
</p><p>She smiled. “Told you there was no way you were going anywhere.”<br/>
</p><p>“My vibrator would’ve done the job just fine,” Agatha replied weakly.<br/>
</p><p>“You keep telling yourself that,” Rio winked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio tugged her underwear down and felt the rush of wetness in her own when Agatha arched her back to make them easier to pull off. The wetness only doubled when Rio looked up to see Agatha’s bare cunt in full view.<br/>
</p><p>She was soaked; the damp dark curls unmissable.<br/>
</p><p>Rio swallowed and committed the image to memory.<br/>
</p><p>She lifted her hands, pressing them in between Agatha’s thighs to spread them further.<br/>
</p><p>“You like this, don’t you?” Rio husked. “A princess on her knees for you. You feel powerful, don’t you, Agatha?”<br/>
</p><p>Because she knew what to say to push her even further.<br/>
</p><p>The brunette's chest was rising and falling so rapidly you might think she’d just ran a half marathon.<br/>
</p><p>“If you don’t fucking touch me right now, I swear to god,” Agatha bit out.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smirked before she leaned in, her tongue out and ready to taste the girl who had turned her world upside down.<br/>
</p><p>She moaned when she pressed her tongue inside Agatha’s core. She tasted just as good as Rio thought she would. Agatha’s back arched off the wall at the same time her hand flew to grip Rio’s head.<br/>
</p><p>“Hm,” Agatha groaned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shot up in bed, panting.<br/>
</p><p>She blinked as the dream receded.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck,” she muttered as she dragged her hand down her face.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was still moaning, but it was on the other side of the wall.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Puta.” <em>Bitch.<br/>
</em></p><p>Recently, every time Agatha had a girl over (which was every other day), she made it her mission to be as loud as possible. She knew the walls were thin, she knew Rio would be able to hear her.<br/>
</p><p>That’s why Rio had been spending more time at Natasha’s or Alice’s. She couldn’t hear it and know that it wasn’t her making Agatha sound like that. She couldn’t hear it without it driving her insane with want.<br/>
</p><p>Although she’d found other means of release (Natasha), it would never be the same as actually having Agatha. She and Natasha only kissed; Rio never wanted it to go further. No one had ever touched her like that before, and as much as Rio didn’t give a fuck about preserving her virginity. There was only one person she wanted her first time to be with.<br/>
</p><p>She was holding out for her and would do so until she was on her deathbed if that’s what Agatha decided.<br/>
</p><p>Rio groaned as she got out of bed, groaned again when she felt the stickiness of her underwear.<br/>
</p><p>“For fucksake,” Rio grumbled as she headed to the shower.<br/>
</p><p>As she showered, she thought about the dreadful date she’d been forced to go on the other day. As of now, she’d been on three out of the five dates her mother had set up for her. Without Agatha there to make them interesting, she found herself poking at her food for two hours as the boys tried and failed to hold a conversation with her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio thought more than once about getting up and leaving, but she couldn’t. Her mother wouldn’t let her return to Spain if she did, and that was one of the only things keeping her going, the promise of returning home. To her friends, to her siblings.<br/>
</p><p>Once she’d finished showering, the other girl was <em>still<em> going. Still moaning as loudly as humanly possible.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio couldn’t listen to that. She put on a black <em>Nike<em> sports bra and sweatpants and headed to Alice’s room, having a quick chat with Lucia before she went.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Her best friend opened the door with a smile, Spanish flowing out of her mouth as she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Morning, Riri.”<br/>
</p><p>There were only two people in the world that Rio let call her that. Her little sister and Alice.<br/>
</p><p>“Morning,” she said as Alice let her in.<br/>
</p><p>“What do you wanna do today?” Alice asked. “Because I was thinking we ask Cia if we can go to brunch.”<br/>
</p><p>“I could do brunch,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>As soon as she finished her sentence, her phone began to ring. Rio pulled it out of her pocket and smiled when she saw who was FaceTiming her.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, Annie.”<br/>
</p><p>Her little sister was on her phone screen. She had her blonde hair in two bunches.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, Riri! I’m in your room!” Ana said as she panned the camera.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed. “I can see that. Alice is here too,” she turned the phone so that her sister could see.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, Ali!” Ana said.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, Ana,” Alice replied. “I like you’re hair.”<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you,” Ana giggled.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you doing in my room?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>Ana frowned before she said, “I like coming in here. I miss you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s heart ached. “I miss you too.”<br/>
</p><p>“When are you coming home?”<br/>
</p><p>“In two weeks, hopefully,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>Ana lit up. “Really?”<br/>
</p><p>“Hopefully, if mami lets me,” Rio smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“I hope she does! I don’t like that you don’t live at home,” Ana told her.<br/>
</p><p>And neither did Rio. She didn’t say this, though; she had to be positive when talking to Ana. She never wanted her sister to know how lonely and miserable she’d been until recently.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll be home soon, okay? And it’s not all bad.”<br/>
</p><p>Her sister furrowed her eyebrows. “No?”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Alice echoed. “Riri’s found herself a little girlfriend,” Alice teased.<br/>
</p><p>Rio whacked her in the arm.<br/>
</p><p>"What?” Alice said through a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“You have!” Ana exclaimed. “What’s her name?”<br/>
</p><p>Before Rio had a chance to tell her sister she in fact, did <em>not<em> have a girlfriend, Alice replied:<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Agatha.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ooo! I bet she’s pretty,” Ana giggled.<br/>
</p><p>“She’s the prettiest, but she is <em>not my girlfriend.”<br/>
</em></p><p>“She isn’t? What is she then?” Her sister asked.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What is she?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio didn’t fucking know. They weren’t friends, they weren’t enemies because she was sure Agatha didn’t hate her anymore, but they weren’t lovers either. Rio liked Agatha, and Agatha liked toying with her. Their relationship was just a whole lot of sexual tension.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s complicated,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Is it?” Alice questioned, her voice high-pitched as if she didn’t believe her.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said matter-of-factly. “Now enough about me, how’s school?”<br/>
</p><p>“I want to meet her,” Ana ignored her question. “Can you bring her home?”<br/>
</p><p>In all honesty, Rio wanted nothing more. She would love to bring Agatha back to Madrid with her, show her all her favourite spots, introduce her to her friends and siblings. But that would never happen.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head, and Ana pouted.<br/>
</p><p>“Now, how’s school?” Rio asked again.<br/>
</p><p>Her sister shrugged. “It’s okay. Boring. Ooo! I’m doing more English lessons, so if I come visit, I can speak it better.”<br/>
</p><p>“Go on,” Rio urged.<br/>
</p><p>Ana switched languages. “Hi, Rio and Alice. My name is Ana, and I have two siblings. My favourite colour is pink, and I like pizza!”<br/>
</p><p>Alice and Rio clapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Well done,” Alice said.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re doing amazing, sweetie,” Rio quoted the trio's favourite meme, which earned her a laugh from both of them.<br/>
</p><p>A voice, Ana’s nanny, told her she had to go. Her sister sighed before she said in Spanish:<br/>
</p><p>“I have to go now. Talk to you soon, sissy. Bye, Ali.”<br/>
</p><p>“Bye,” Alice and Rio said together.<br/>
</p><p>“I love you,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>“I love you too,” Ana replied before she hung up.<br/>
</p><p>Rio put her phone down and turned to Alice, who had her eyebrow raised.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s complicated, huh?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Shut up and go change, I’m starving.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice laughed.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>“For fucksake,” Agatha grumbled as she looked down.<br/>
</p><p>She’d started her fucking period.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha hated everything.<br/>
</p><p>After her conversation with Rio-Sofia last night, Agatha very nearly knocked on the princess’s door. She paced around outside it for about twenty minutes until she finally talked herself out of it, texted Wanda for the first time all week, and invited her over for a fuck.<br/>
</p><p>They’d been at it all night and all morning, and she <em>still<em> couldn't get the princess out of her head. Was Rio-Sofia a drug? Why the fuck couldn’t she stop thinking about her? She felt like a coke addict who could only think about their next fix.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>And now she was on her fucking period.<br/>
</p><p>“Bloody brilliant,” Agatha muttered.<br/>
</p><p>She got off the toilet and headed to the shower. Once she was moisturised and dressed, she filled up her hot water bottle, got out her stuffed bunny Señor Scratchy, her father had given to her as a baby before he died from her wardrobe, and curled into a foetal position on her bed.<br/>
</p><p>Her cramps were kicking her ass.<br/>
</p><p>She tried to wait it out. She always felt good when she powered through her cramps without taking ibuprofen or paracetamol. It made her feel powerful when she battled them without any aid.<br/>
</p><p>She tossed and turned in bed, her stuffed bunny pressed into her chest until she couldn’t do it anymore. She rolled her eyes before finding her box of ibuprofen, popping two in her mouth and washing them down with water.<br/>
</p><p>Once that was done, she went into her wardrobe to put on Rio-Sofia’s hoodie. She put the hood up and climbed back into bed.<br/>
</p><p>She fell asleep.<br/>
</p><p>When she woke up her cramps had finally fucked off and she had a craving for ice cream.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t have any ice cream. Agatha also didn’t feel like leaving the flat. She picked up her phone from her bedside table.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: Are you out rn?<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia replied almost immediately.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Bitchy Princess: yeah. i’m with al. we’re coming back soon. why?<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: Are you going to the supermarket?<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Bitchy Princess: wasn’t planning on it. what do you want?<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: nothing.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Bitchy Princess: agatha.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: Ice cream…<em>Ben and Jerry’s<em>…cookie dough…please?<br/>
</em></em></strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Bitchy Princess: you got it ;)<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and put her phone down.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>An hour later, there was a knock on her door.<br/>
</p><p>“Come in,” Agatha said because she wasn’t getting up.<br/>
</p><p>Her door opened and closed, and Rio-Sofia appeared. She had an orange <em>Sainsbury’s<em> shopping bag in her hand.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio-Sofia lifted her eyebrows in amusement as she took in Agatha’s position. She was still curled in a ball with her hot water bottle and stuffed bunny.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay?”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha grumbled. “I’m on my period.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ah, that explains why you were being weird,” Rio-Sofia replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Huh?”<br/>
</p><p>“You said ‘please’ in your text. You never say please,” Rio-Sofia said.<br/>
</p><p>“I say please,” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Maybe, just never to me,” Rio-Sofia smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glared at her before she handed over the bag.<br/>
</p><p>“M’lady,” Rio-Sofia said as Agatha took it. “Your ice cream.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled the bag open to see <em>six<em> tubs of Ben and Jerry’s cookie dough ice cream.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha looked up at her in shock. “Rio-Sofia I asked for one tub of ice cream.”<br/>
</p><p>“You actually didn’t specify,” the princess replied without missing a beat.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “You always have to go above and beyond, don’t you?”<br/>
</p><p>“When it’s for the right person, yes,” Rio-Sofia winked. “Enjoy,” she said in a sing-song voice before she left the room.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha fought the urge to smile. She pulled one of the tubs from the bag and groaned when she realised she didn’t have a spoon.<br/>
</p><p>She dragged herself out of bed and made her way to the kitchen, where she found Jen eating a bowl of pasta.<br/>
</p><p>“You alright, babe?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m on my bloody period,” Agatha replied as she pulled open the freezer door so she could put her ice cream tubs in her drawer.<br/>
</p><p>“Ah, sorry.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grunted in response as she tried to fit in all of her ice cream. Did she have enough space for all of it?<br/>
</p><p>“Woah, did you take out a small loan?” Jen asked as she eyed Agatha’s ice cream tubs. “Ben and Jerry’s goes for £5.25 a tub at least.”<br/>
</p><p>“I actually have no problem spending that much on a tub of Ben and Jerry’s. They are one of the only companies that speak up about world issues,” Agatha huffed as she couldn’t fit the fifth tub into the freezer.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes…but we’re uni students. We can afford one every blue moon.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned to glare at her.<br/>
</p><p>Jen snapped her fingers. “Rio bought them for you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked. Yes…but how would her best friend know that?<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Agatha replied, turning back to the freezer.<br/>
</p><p>Jen laughed. “She did. You really do have the princess of Spain wrapped around your finger, huh?” Jen laughed again. “Of course, you fucking do. You’re the only person who could.”<br/>
</p><p>Thank fuck Agatha’s head was in the freezer because there was no hiding the grin that painted her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Whatever,” Agatha replied when she’d finally gotten the fifth tub in.<br/>
</p><p>She retrieved the one she left on the countertop, grabbed two spoons and sat next to Jen around the kitchen island. She handed Jen the spare spoon.<br/>
</p><p>“I haven’t finished my pasta yet,” Jen told her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha just stared at her until her best friend sighed and took the spoon.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha cracked the tub open and dug in. It was just what she needed.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, what are you going to be for Halloween?” Jen asked as she licked her spoon.<br/>
</p><p>“Huh?”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, it’s this week,” Jen replied. “You gotta decide now.”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t know. I’ve never done Halloween.”<br/>
</p><p>Her mother deemed Halloween the devil’s holiday, and therefore, Agatha had never celebrated it.<br/>
</p><p>“So? We aren’t at home anymore. Halloween is the messiest night of the year for uni students, according to Nat. We gotta go all out,” Jen told her.<br/>
</p><p>Mess. Agatha could do with more mess.<br/>
</p><p>“What did you have in mind?” Agatha grinned.</p>

<em>The messiest night of the year.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>That’s what Natasha said, had kept saying every day leading up to it.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had never celebrated Halloween, they didn’t in Spain, you know, catholic country and all. And even if they did, her mother would never allow her to, you know, Spanish princess and all.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was certain she wouldn’t be allowed to go. She’d already pushed her luck with the night out from a couple of weeks ago, she didn’t want to ask Lucia again. But the girls kept nagging, and the more Natasha spoke about their last Halloween, the more Rio wanted to go.<br/>
</p><p>They had been in the kitchen on the Tuesday when Rio asked:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Cia, would I be able to go out on Halloween…please?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Rio,” Lucia warned in that voice that was laced with authority that she rarely ever used on her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Please, Lucia,” Natasha begged. “We’ll look after her, and my sister’s coming down from uni in Manchester and I want Rio to meet her.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lucia shook her head. “I can’t let Rio go out on her own again. Plus, as much as me and Cami (Rio’s bodyguard who hadn’t snitched on her on initiation night) are willing to cover for you, there is a limit.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio nodded. It had been worth a shot.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“What if you come with us?” Alice asked.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lucia and Rio both raised an eyebrow.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I’m being serious. That way, Cia can watch over Ri. That’s the biggest issue, right?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lucia shook her head. “I don’t know. Aren’t I too old to be around you guys at a party?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“How old are you?” Natasha asked eagerly.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio glanced at her. She was not being subtle at all.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Twenty-two,” Lucia replied.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Natasha waved her off. “That’s fine. The party we’re going to is at Steve’s house, and he lives with a bunch of third years. There’s bound to be some twenty-two-year-olds there.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>It was clear Lucia was still sceptical. “I don’t know.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Cia, please,” Rio pleaded.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lucia stared at her for a while, clearly conflicted about what to say.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>She huffed before she said, “Fine.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>That evening, Rio and Alice ordered their Halloween costumes. After an hour long discussion of what Rio could be, she and Alice, with some input from Lucia decided she was going to be a knight…a slutty knight.<br/>
</p><p>Alice would be a Barbie because she and Jen thought it would be funny to switch aesthetics. They also ordered Lucia a costume. She said she didn’t want to dress up, but Rio couldn’t have Lucia not in costume. She’d stick out like a sore thumb. Lucia was going to be a cowgirl.<br/>
</p><p>Their costumes arrived the next day, and after Rio’s lecture, she and Alice spent the afternoon spray painting her top silver. Rio guessed it wasn’t surprising that sparkly silver tops were a bitch to find.<br/>
</p><p>She’d ordered a white strapless corset that had to be laced up by ribbons down each side, a silver metallic mini skirt Alice had somehow found, a knight’s helmet with matching gloves and a plastic sword.<br/>
</p><p>Once the corset was painted and dried, they added splats of a bronze paint on the skirt and top to give it a dirty, well-worn look. As for Rio’s shoes, she luckily had a pair of silver <em>Adidas Samba’s X Wales Bonner’s<em> with white stripes that worked surprisingly well.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Now, on Thursday, the day of Halloween, Rio was buzzing. She was ready for a night promised of mess and alcohol. Although she still didn’t know what Agatha was going to be. The brunette had been tight-lipped on that fact.<br/>
</p><p>She was in Alice’s bedroom after her seminar, counting down the minutes until she could start getting ready. Jen was there too.<br/>
</p><p>“When does pres start again?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>“I think Nat said seven, she has to pick Yelena up from Euston,” Alice replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Have you met her sister before?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>Alice nodded. “She’s nice but insane. She stayed in Russia for a few more years than Nat did, and you know the Russians, they love to drink,” Alice laughed as if recalling a memory. “Last year, when she came to visit, she made us do a shot every ten minutes. I’d never been so drunk in my life.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed. “And I thought Nat was bad.”<br/>
</p><p>“Nat is nothing compared to Yelena,” Alice laughed again.<br/>
</p><p>There was a knock on Alice’s door then.<br/>
</p><p>“Come in,” Alice called.<br/>
</p><p>The door opened, and Agatha stepped inside. It was evident she was in the middle of getting ready. Her wet hair was tied up in a bun, and she’d started prepping her face for makeup.<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve started already?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha replied. “We’ve got two hours, and you know how long I take. I’m surprised <em>you<em> haven’t started yet.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Jen sat up from where she’d been sprawled out on Alice’s bed. “You’re so right. Bye guys,” Jen said before she left.<br/>
</p><p>“Bye,” Rio and Alice said through a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“Are either of you good at eyeliner? I’ve never done it before, and I wanna do it for tonight,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio is,” Alice replied. “I mean look at it,” she pointed at Rio’s eyeliner.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded as if admiring her handiwork.<br/>
</p><p>“Help me?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked at her for a long moment before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Sure.”<br/>
</p><p>“Perfect, come with me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio sighed before getting off Alice’s bed. “See you later, Al.”<br/>
</p><p>“Bye,” Alice replied.<br/>
</p><p>They left Alice’s room and headed to Agatha’s, saying hi to Lucia before they entered.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s room was a mess; her clothes were all over the floor, her hair products were on every surface, and her makeup was spread across her desk.<br/>
</p><p>“What have you been doing?” Rio asked through a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scowled at her. “What does it look like I’ve been doing?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head playfully.<br/>
</p><p>“Right, how are we doing this?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio just needed her to sit down somewhere so that she could lean over her…but where was the fun in that? They were still fucking with each other after all.<br/>
</p><p>“Lie down on your bed,” Rio instructed.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Is that necessary?”<br/>
</p><p>“You want the best results or not?” Rio argued.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha huffed before she did as Rio asked, moving the clothes on her bed onto the floor so she could lie down.<br/>
</p><p>Rio spotted the stuffed bunny she’d been cradling on the weekend amongst the clothes. She picked it up and put it on the bed.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t think your bunny deserves to be on the floor,” she said.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s their name?”<br/>
</p><p>“Señor Scratchy,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, el es Español.” <em>Oh, he’s Spanish<em>. Rio replied with a smile.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Sí.”<br/>
</p><p>“¿Por qué?” <em>Why?<br/>
</em></p><p>“No es asunto tuyo.” <em>None of your business.<em> Agatha snapped.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Okay,” Rio laughed. “Where’s your eyeliner?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pointed to her desk, which was covered in her makeup products.<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed. “Course.”<br/>
</p><p>She went over to it and poked around at the array of items for a good couple of minutes before she found a black eyeliner pencil and black liquid eyeliner. She grabbed both and climbed on Agatha’s bed before straddling her, sitting on her stomach.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “This isn’t necessary.”<br/>
</p><p>“Hey,” Rio tapped her on the arm. “Who’s the eyeliner guru? Me or you?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha cringed. “Don’t ever say that again.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed.<br/>
</p><p>She uncapped the eyeliner pencil and arched her back so she could lean over Agatha’s face.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>God, her eyes are so pretty.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>This close, Rio could see the misty white that spread out from Agatha’s pupils into the rest of her blue irises.<br/>
</p><p>“Your eyes are beautiful,” Rio breathed.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Shut up and do my eyeliner.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed before she asked her to close her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha did, Rio caressed her face, fingers resting lightly on her chin to keep her head in place, thumb pressing into her cheek. She didn’t miss the way the brunette’s breath hitched as she did so.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled before beginning to apply the eyeliner. She’d almost finished with Agatha’s right eye when she very nearly had to start all over again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s hands had snaked up her the back of her thighs to rest on her hips. She stroked the bare skin between Rio’s shorts and tank top with her thumbs.<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked to try and keep her concentration. Her entire body tingled because of the sensation, and she could feel her underwear dampening.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Normally, she would power through, but she wanted to do Agatha’s eyeliner properly.<br/>
</p><p>“S…<em>stop<em>,” Rio got out breathlessly.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Why?” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>Her eyes were still shut, thank god. She couldn’t see the facial expression on Rio’s face.<br/>
</p><p>“Can you not focus?” Agatha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>“N…” Rio cut herself off with a quiet moan when Agatha’s hands dropped to palm her ass.<br/>
</p><p>“You said being like this was necessary,” Agatha told her. “This is what you wanted, right?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s fingers rubbed the bare skin underneath Rio’s shorts, and she had to make sure she kept herself upright and didn’t fall on the girl beneath her.<br/>
</p><p>“You can keep going, darlin. I believe in you,” Agatha mocked.<br/>
</p><p>“N…no. I can’t. I don’t want to ruin your makeup-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha cut her off. “Keep. Going.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip, goosebumps spreading across her arms as her body came alive the more Agatha touched her ass.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I need to fuck her. I need to fuck her. I need to fuck her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Oh…okay,” Rio got out.<br/>
</p><p>With a shaky hand, she moved on to Agatha’s left eye. She strengthened her grip around the pencil so much that her knuckles turned white. Rio tried and failed to steady her breath as Agatha continued with her incessive movement.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha’s left hand ran up the length of her back underneath her top, Rio almost fell on her.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay?” Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck you,” Rio whispered as her hand trembled.<br/>
</p><p>What felt like a lifetime later, she’d finished with Agatha’s eyeliner. Normally, she’d go over the pencil with liquid eyeliner, but she needed to get off Agatha as quickly as possible.<br/>
</p><p>It was most definitely not her best work, but it would do.<br/>
</p><p>“Done,” Rio announced as she snatch Agatha’s hands off her body and scrambled off the bed.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha sat up with a smirk, and Rio tried her hardest not to squeeze her legs together. She needed to get hosed down; she needed a shower.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m gonna get ready now.”<br/>
</p><p>“Why the rush?” Agatha’s smirk never wavered.<br/>
</p><p>“Gotta go get myself off to you in the shower,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha burst out laughing.<br/>
</p><p>“Adios,” Rio said as she turned to leave.<br/>
</p><p>“You want help?”<br/>
</p><p>“Get fucked,” Rio called back as she left the room.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>After Rio’s <em>very<em> long shower, she did her makeup and changed into her costume. Alice had done her hair by adding silver pieces of tinsel throughout. Every time it caught the light, her dark hair would shimmer.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>There was a knock on her door before that voice said:<br/>
</p><p>“You wanna see my costume?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio had been waiting all day. “Yeah, come in.”<br/>
</p><p>The door opened, and Rio’s jaw dropped.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was Princess Mia Thermopolis from <em>The Princess Diaries.<em> She wore a short cream strapless dress that had a ruffled trim around the bust. The dress was corseted on her frame before it flowed out into the short skirt at the end. She had long cream gloves to match, black headphones atop her head of loose beach waves and what looked like a replica of Rio’s tiara from her speech four months ago.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>That’s when Rio noticed the pink lipstick and pink blush. It was the <em>exact<em> shade she’d been wearing on that dreadful day.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You…how did you get my tiara?” Rio got out.<br/>
</p><p>“I spoke to Lucia,” Agatha grinned as she walked into the room.<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked at her, her mouth still agape because she genuinely didn’t know what to say.<br/>
</p><p>“You gonna be my knight in shining armour tonight then?” Agatha teased as she flipped the cover of Rio’s helmet down to cover her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was still gaping at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Hm,” Agatha hummed, undeterred by how unresponsive Rio was. “It’s missing something.”<br/>
</p><p>She pulled off Rio’s helmet and pressed the plastic to her lips. When she removed it, there was a kiss mark on it.<br/>
</p><p>“There!” Agatha said as she admired her handiwork. “Now, everyone knows you have a princess waiting for you at home.”<br/>
</p><p>That took Rio out of her perplexed state.<br/>
</p><p>“You’ll be waiting for me then?”<br/>
</p><p>“You would want that, wouldn’t you?” Agatha smirked. “Nope, but it’ll let people know you’re spoken for.”<br/>
</p><p>“Which I’m not,” Rio replied. “One wipe and that’s gone.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. She was caught. Either she admitted she wanted Rio, or she accepted the fact that Rio could do whatever she pleased tonight.<br/>
</p><p>With her eyes still narrowed, she walked Rio backwards until her knees hit the back of her bed and she fell onto it.<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What is she-<br/>
</em>
</p><p>That thought got cut off when Agatha tipped her head to kiss the edge of her right breast.<br/>
</p><p>Rio froze as the wet lips stayed glued to her for far longer than was necessary.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha pulled away, a string of saliva followed in her wake, and Rio squeezed her legs together.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Try getting that off.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked down at the bright pink kiss mark on her chest.<br/>
</p><p>“See you at Nat’s,” Agatha sing-songed as she turned on her heels and left the room.<br/>
</p><p>“Mierda.” <em>Shit.<em> Rio muttered under her breath.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha was going to kill her.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Natasha’s sister Yelena was Agatha’s type of person. She was yelling ‘shot o’clock’ every ten minutes, and every ten minutes, Agatha was tipping some sort of alcohol down her throat in a plastic shot glass.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha, I love you!” Yelena exclaimed in her thick Russian accent. The blonde was wearing a black skin-tight spy costume identical to her sister’s. “You’re the only one keeping up!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed as Yelena handed her another shot.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was fucked.<br/>
</p><p>Should she be this fucked at 8 PM? Nope.<br/>
</p><p>She was glad her period had finished the day before, in fear that she wouldn’t be able to wear her costume. She’d known what she wanted to be since she’d decided with Jen on the Sunday. Agatha wanted to mess with the princess, and her costume, a literal princess, was the best way to do so.<br/>
</p><p>She spent far too long researching what shade of lipstick and blush the princess had been wearing in her speech, so she could buy it. Luckily, with the tiara, all she had to do was ask Lucia, and she told her where she could buy a replica.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia’s reaction was priceless. Agatha wished she could’ve taken a picture.<br/>
</p><p>And not that Agatha liked this fact, but she didn’t mind that Rio-Sofia was a knight…it kind of seemed like they had done it on purpose.<br/>
</p><p>A princess and a knight. Like they’d coordinated. (Like a couple).<br/>
</p><p>Agatha necked the shot and winced when she realised Yelena had given her vodka.<br/>
</p><p>“Eugh!” Agatha grimaced as Yelena laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s the good stuff!”<br/>
</p><p>“Cheap vodka from <em>Tesco<em>? Yeah, I don’t think so,” Agatha wiped her chin from where she’d spilt her drink.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You and your girlfriend are cute by the way, your couple's costume,” Yelena added.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows, too drunk to process what Yelena was saying.<br/>
</p><p>“The girl you were talking to when you came in,” she nodded to Rio-Sofia.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha replied when she understood. <em>Oh<em>. “That’s not my girlfriend,” Agatha spluttered. “That’s my…er…”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Right…” Yelena laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“She’s the princess of Spain, you know, Rio-Sofia,” Agatha said because that she did know.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh!” Yelena snapped her fingers in recognition. “<em>That’s her?<em> Nat was not lying, she's gorgeous.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted with anger and discomfort.<br/>
</p><p>“What are we drinking?” Jen said from behind her, her hands resting on Agatha’s shoulders. “Ooo,” Jen said as she pulled her hand away. “Maybe I went too far with the body glitter." She rubbed her fingers together.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned to see her best friend in Alice’s clothes with heavy eyeliner and eyeshadow. She even had Alice’s hair, a black wolf cut streaked with red.<br/>
</p><p>“Where on earth did you get that from?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Costume shop,” Jen grinned. “You like?” She twirled on the spot.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Love,<em>” Agatha smiled.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Oh, you must be Yelena,” Jen said to the blonde.<br/>
</p><p>They started up a conversation, and Agatha no longer needed to be in the kitchen; she was drunk enough. She picked up her <em>Pepsi<em> and rum and, with extra effort, and made her way to the seating area. It was made up of mostly the hockey girls and some of Natasha’s course friends.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The sofa was full, Rio-Sofia sitting between Lucia in her cowboy costume and Alice in a bright pink Barbie dress.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not sure if there’s space over there, Aggs,” Wanda told her from her chair in the corner away from the sofa. “You wanna sit with me?”<br/>
</p><p>“It’s okay,” Agatha replied before she made her way to the sofa.<br/>
</p><p>She shuffled between people’s legs hanging off the sofa and the table before it, until she plopped herself down on Rio-Sofia’s lap. She almost made the princess spill her drink.<br/>
</p><p>“Hello?” Rio-Sofia laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“There was no space and your legs were free,” Agatha shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Rio-Sofia replied as she wrapped the free arm not holding her drink around Agatha’s stomach.<br/>
</p><p>“Are they together officially now?" Agatha overheard Lucia whisper to Alice.<br/>
</p><p>“No one knows at this point,” Alice replied.</p>

<p>Everyone was off their fucking faces.<br/>
</p><p>Yelena and Natasha had been on a mission to get everyone as drunk as humanly possible, and they had succeeded. Agatha didn’t even want to think about how many bottles of alcohol they’d been through, enough to fill a landfill if she <em>had<em> to guess.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Yelena had come round what felt like every minute with a tray of plastic shot glasses, and everyone dutifully took one.<br/>
</p><p>She’d been sitting on Rio-Sofia’s lap throughout pres and revelled in the fact that she had to keep getting up and down to grab her shot. It was making the princess squirm beneath her, her ass brushing up against Rio-Sofia’s core whenever she shifted.<br/>
</p><p>The princess’s hand around her stomach had kept tensing as if trying to get a hold of herself, and Agatha had never felt so smug in her life.<br/>
</p><p>It felt powerful to know she could have this much of an effect on someone, that she could touch Rio-Sofia in any way and know that she’d melt in her hands like she had in her bedroom earlier.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia’s skin had been so soft, so perfect under Agatha’s hands.<br/>
</p><p>Now, after trying to navigate the London tube system with only three brain cells working between all thirty of the pres party, they’d made it to Steve’s student house in Finchley.<br/>
</p><p>The three-story house was <em>packed.<em> People spilt out into the street, and the music, along with laughter and shouts, could be heard down the road.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Fuck me,” Jen mumbled as she looked at the house.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha and Rio-Sofia laughed. The princess had her arm wrapped around her waist.<br/>
</p><p>They’d been inseparable. Agatha tried to start up with their game, but she couldn’t bring herself to pull away from Rio-Sofia. Whilst they were stumbling around trying to find the right tube back in Euston Station, Rio’s hand was in hers the entire time. On the tube, she’d sat on Rio’s lap again when there were multiple seats available.<br/>
</p><p>They began walking into the house when the princess whispered in her ear:<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s see how long you can keep your hands off me then.”<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha looked at her, she smirked before disappearing through the open door and into the raging party beyond.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The game had begun.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>OMG by Usher ft will.i.am<em> was blaring once Agatha stepped inside the house.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“You look like you’ve short-circuited,” Jen laughed. “Are you too drunk? You need water?”<br/>
</p><p>No. Agatha didn’t need water. She needed to win.<br/>
</p><p>So what, she’d had complete and utter access to Rio-Sofia for the past two hours? She had self-control. She could go the entire night without touching her.<br/>
</p><p>“Vodka,” was all Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>Jen eyed her sceptically. “Are you sure? You literally look like someone has stolen the breath from your lungs.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glared at her. “Jen! Where’s the fucking vodka?!”<br/>
</p><p>Her best friend's eyes widened. “I don’t know. We’ll find the kitchen.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen took her by the hand and dragged her down the flight of stairs before them. They weaved through people until they made it to the large table covered in drinks.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snatched up the closest bottle of vodka, twisted off the cap, and drank it straight from the bottle.<br/>
</p><p>Jen blinked at her. “I always knew you were a little crazy…but that’s just straight up psychotic. How the hell have you just gone and done that?”<br/>
</p><p>“Straight vodka? Are you crumbling already, Agatha?” That irritating fucking voice rasped in her ear.<br/>
</p><p>Where the fuck had Rio-Sofia even come from?!<br/>
</p><p>The princess pulled the bottle out of her hand and drank from it too. She never broke eye contact as she guzzled it down like water.<br/>
</p><p>“Guess you're crumbling too,” Agatha nodded to the bottle.<br/>
</p><p>“Nope. I want you; I’ve made that very clear. <em>I<em> can touch you unless you tell me not to.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio-Sofia reached up to run her thumb over Agatha’s bottom lip, collecting the residue vodka that had been left there. She sucked her thumb into her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“See. No resistance,” Rio-Sofia smirked. “Question is, how long can you resist not touching me?”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re gonna be very disappointed when you go this entire night untouched,” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Is that why your hand is twitching?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked down to see her left hand tensing just before Rio-Sofia’s thigh.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s the alcohol,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Whatever you say, princess,” the princess winked before she pushed the vodka bottle into Agatha’s hand and walked away.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s hand tightened around the bottle.<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck was that about?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply, just brought the vodka bottle to her lips and chugged.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Maybe it was the way Agatha had touched Rio in her bedroom earlier, maybe it was Agatha’s lips imprinted on her right breast, maybe it was because it was the messiest night of the year, why Rio had the burning desire to push Agatha to her limits tonight.<br/>
</p><p>She’d indulged in the way the brunette was so willing to touch her earlier at pres and that’s when Rio had thought of the idea. What if she just…cut Agatha off?<br/>
</p><p>Rio was dancing with Alice and Lucia on the dance floor (living room). A disco ball had been strung up, white dots washed over the room. Rio was sweating and laughing as bodies pushed into her. There had to be next to a hundred people in the house.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha came up to them then, and she didn’t hesitate to grab Rio’s hips and press her against her back. Their bodies moved together in time with the music, <em>Like A G6 by Far East Movement, The Cataracs, DEV.<em> Rio brought her hand up to run through her hair.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She laughed, her head falling back on Natasha’s heated body.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, how Rio loved being drunk.<br/>
</p><p>When she lifted her head again, she locked onto Agatha on the sofa on the other side of the room. With so many people in the way, the contact broke, and the next time Rio saw her again, she had her tongue down Wanda’s throat.<br/>
</p><p>Rio grinned.<br/>
</p><p>She was so winning this round.<br/>
</p><p>She turned to face Natasha.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Put your hands up, make you put your hands up, p-put your hands up<em>,” the song instructed.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Everyone on the makeshift dance floor complied.<br/>
</p><p>Rio locked her hands with Natasha’s, their fingers tangling together as she brought their arms down in a rainbow type ark. The beat kicked in again, and Natasha started shimmying her shoulders backwards. Rio laughed before she copied the movement forward and vice versa.<br/>
</p><p>She freed her right hand to beckon Natasha forward with her index finger.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha went dutifully and pressed their lips together in a lazy kiss.<br/>
</p><p>She needed respite. She’d gone without Agatha’s touch for a little over half an hour now. Rio didn’t know what was worse, having Agatha touch her and not getting release, or having Agatha not touch her, and the knots in her stomach tighten regardless.<br/>
</p><p>Now, should Rio be kissing someone in the open like this?<br/>
</p><p>Nope. But drunk Rio doesn’t give a fuck if the last couple of weeks had told her anything.<br/>
</p><p>“Oi! Stop getting me to kiss you out in public, it’s not allowed,” Natasha teased.<br/>
</p><p>Rio threw her head back and laughed. “You have free will, Nat.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, but you’re pretty. I’m not saying no to you,” she smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed again before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“I’m gonna get another drink.”<br/>
</p><p>“Alright.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio entered the kitchen and grinned when she saw the only girl that mattered there.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha hadn’t seen her as she was filling up her cup, so naturally, Rio snuck up behind her and whispered in her ear:<br/>
</p><p>“How you holding up, baby? Is Wanda keeping you satisfied, or is it my turn yet?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha flinched at the sound of her voice. She steeled herself before turning to face her, her blue eyes looking up at Rio through her eyelashes.<br/>
</p><p>Rio forced herself not to swallow. Agatha was so fucking sexy.<br/>
</p><p>“Did you wish it was me?” Agatha’s voice was dripping with seduction.<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“Dancing with you. Did you wish it was my hands holding on you, my body pressed against yours, your fingers in my hair, your lips against mine?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yep,” Rio replied without missing a beat. “But we’re seeing how long you can go without touching me. Balls in your court. You ready to play?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m <em>not<em> touching you.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio grinned. “Keep telling yourself that.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, picking up her drink and leaving.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“You missing me yet?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You can have me, just say the word.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You could kiss Wanda all night, and that tight knot wouldn’t be going anywhere, do you know why? Because she isn’t me.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“<em>How soaked are you right now?”<br/>
</em></p><p>All night, Rio-Sofia whispered things like this into Agatha’s ear. She would pop out of nowhere, brush her lips against her skin, smirk, and then disappear.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wouldn’t cave.<br/>
</p><p>But oh, how she wanted to watch Rio-Sofia shatter under her touch.<br/>
</p><p>If she just gave in…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Stop it.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She’d had the upper hand the entire evening up until the party, and she needed to maintain it. So what Rio-Sofia had introduced this diabolical play? Agatha could keep up.<br/>
</p><p>She rolled her head back to try and relax her body. It was pent up with unreleased tension and the princess was fucking right. Wanda wasn’t working today.<br/>
</p><p>Why wasn’t she working?<br/>
</p><p>Her core ached; she’d been clenching around nothing for nearly three hours now.<br/>
</p><p>Fingers threaded through the ends of her hair, and Agatha couldn’t help the quiet moan that left her mouth as she tipped her head back.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Stop it.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She turned slowly, until she was facing her.<br/>
</p><p>“My fingers can do so much more than play with your hair,” Rio-Sofia hummed.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Do it. Touch her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>No, don’t! Stop. It.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha glared at her, the battle that had been playing out in her head all night louder than ever. She could feel her breath getting deeper as brown eyes flicked between hers.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Don’t you dare…<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Bingo.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>A slow smile spread across Agatha’s lips. She walked past Rio-Sofia and beckoned her to follow. To no surprise to Agatha, the princess followed.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t stop walking until they were in the closest bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>“Lock the door,” she ordered.<br/>
</p><p>Rio did so.<br/>
</p><p>“On your knees.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed before she did as she was told.<br/>
</p><p>“You said you were still going to touch me, right?”<br/>
</p><p>The princess nodded, looking up at her from the floor.<br/>
</p><p>The princess of Spain kneeling before Agatha. How it all made sense.<br/>
</p><p>“Touch me then,” Agatha told her as she rested her back against the sink.<br/>
</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “You’re letting me?”<br/>
</p><p>“I think I just said that. By your rules, <em>you<em> can touch me. So, do it.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio’s hands snaked up her legs, and Agatha had to stop herself from shuddering. She spread her legs open slowly, and Agatha almost groaned when the cool air breezed over her soaked underwear.<br/>
</p><p>“Hold that up,” Rio instructed as she nodded to the fabric of Agatha’s dress.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled it up casually as if she weren’t dying for Rio to put her fingers or tongue inside her.<br/>
</p><p>The princess didn’t break eye contact as she planted the first kiss on Agatha’s inner thigh. Her thigh tingled immediately, and Agatha had to force herself to keep her eyes open. Closing them meant surrender.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wasn’t surrendering.<br/>
</p><p>Brown eyes remained locked on her as she planted more soft kisses on Agatha’s right thigh before she switched to the left.<br/>
</p><p>Rio took her eyes off her to run her tongue over her underwear, and Agatha bit her lip to stifle her moan. She already hated herself for giving in like this, she wouldn’t give the princess the satisfaction of knowing how good she was making her feel.<br/>
</p><p>Rio licked her lips. “Sweet.” It was all she said.<br/>
</p><p>At the speed of a fucking snail, Rio pulled Agatha’s lacey black underwear off her body until it dropped to the ground.<br/>
</p><p>Brown eyes were on her again, and Agatha’s grip around the sink top tightened as she fought the urge to reach out and touch her. She was still winning this. She would still go the entire night without touching her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s fingers grazed the edge of her core, playing with the short hair there, and Agatha physically couldn’t stop herself from jolting every time her cunt clenched around nothing.<br/>
</p><p>The princess’s grin was wicked.<br/>
</p><p>“Even if you won’t admit to me that you want me, your body is,” Rio said as Agatha’s body twitched again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt her breath getting shallower. “Put your fingers inside me,” Agatha demanded until she whimpered when Rio’s finger ran against her entrance.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” came the response.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha parted her lips to scream at her when Rio’s tongue ran through her folds.<br/>
</p><p>This time, she couldn’t stop the groan that left her mouth. Her core reacted in kind, and she felt the first rush of wetness leak out.<br/>
</p><p>Rio lapped it up eagerly until the next flood came.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha fought the urge to thread her hand through Rio’s hair to keep her head in place. Her knuckles were going white as she gripped onto the sink counter for dear life.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s hips jerked up when Rio drew back to blow a cool stream of air over her sensitive clit. Her hand flew up to her mouth to stifle her moans.<br/>
</p><p>Her hand vibrated with a low hum as Rio circled her clit with the tip of her tongue. The movement was slow and precise, and Agatha’s hips twitched again.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Fuck, fuck, fuck<em>,” Agatha mumbled breathlessly.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio circled her clit again, and again, and Agatha could feel the climax building.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had fucked a number of girls, and no one had ever made her feel like this. Her entire body was alive and buzzing with adrenaline and anticipation as it searched for its release.<br/>
</p><p>Rio gradually picked up her pace, those slow circles becoming faster and eager.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt her body tensing up, knowing it was moments away from release. Her hips pushed desperately against Rio’s mouth…until the princess stopped.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio pulled back, her mouth and chin were glistening with Agatha’s slick. That tongue that had been in Agatha’s cunt seconds before darted out to lap it up.<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck are you doing?” Agatha panted.<br/>
</p><p>“You ready to touch me yet?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked, still in her haze of lust.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What the fuck is she talking about? Oh-<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha got out, her chest still rising and falling rapidly.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay then,” Rio-Sofia got up.<br/>
</p><p>“W-what do you mean?” Agatha spluttered.<br/>
</p><p>The princess shrugged. “I’m done now.”<br/>
</p><p>“No, you’re fucking not!” Agatha shrieked. “Get on your knees again.”<br/>
</p><p>“You gonna touch me?”<br/>
</p><p>“No.”<br/>
</p><p>“Then no.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked at her. “But you can’t…you just…”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia grinned. “Oh, I think I can. Touch me and then we can pick up where we left off, kay?”<br/>
</p><p>The princess pecked her then, and Agatha tasted herself on Rio-Sofia’s lips before she left the bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped. Rio-Sofia had left her with her underwear around her ankles, still fucking soaked and moments away from release.<br/>
</p><p>Understandably, Agatha was fuming.<br/>
</p><p>She yanked her underwear up and stormed out of the bathroom with one thing on her mind.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Get release.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She entered the kitchen and saw Rio-Sofia around the drinks table laughing with the girls as if she wasn’t about to make Agatha come ten seconds ago.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scanned the room for a potential candidate when a girl bumped into her. She turned to scowl at her when her eyes widened.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>You?<em>”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>It was fucking Izzy.<br/>
</p><p>“Your fucking girlfriend punched me in the face the other day!” Agatha yelled. “I asked you twice if you were single, and you said yes!”<br/>
</p><p>The brunette nodded before her face turned sombre. “She’s not my girlfriend anymore. She broke up with me.”<br/>
</p><p>“No fucking shit! You cheated!”<br/>
</p><p>“I couldn’t say no to you!” The girl replied. “You’re just so fucking beautiful I had to have you. I’m sorry,” she whispered the last part.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “So, you’re single?”<br/>
</p><p>Izzy nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“You wanna eat me out in the bathroom?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes!” Izzy replied eagerly.<br/>
</p><p>“Perfect!” Agatha grabbed Izzy by the neck and kissed her.<br/>
</p><p>She peeled an eye open and lo and behold, Rio-Sofia was glaring at her, her hand tightening around the cup she was holding.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Bingo.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She pulled away from Izzy and dragged her to the bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The head was…okay? (It was nothing compared to how Rio-Sofia had made her feel). At least she’d come.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha told Izzy to leave as she freshened up. When she walked out of the bathroom and saw Rio-Sofia again, she had to act like she'd just had the best sex of her life.<br/>
</p><p>She ran her fingers through her hair, centred her tiara, and breezed out of the bathroom with a smirk on her face.<br/>
</p><p>The girls, minus Alice, were still at the drinks table as she approached.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha caught Natasha’s expression first; her eyes were stern as she glared at Wanda. Jen looked confused, and Rio-Sofia looked panicked, her eyes rimmed with tears. Those eyes widened before Wanda threw her drink in the princess’s face.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stopped short, a mixture of rage and confusion halting her until the rage won out and she stormed over to them.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha?” Wanda asked. Agatha ignored her.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey,” she reached out to touch Rio for the first time since they arrived. Her hand gripped her wet arm. “Are you okay? Let’s get you dried off.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio snatched her hand away. “Don’t fucking touch me!” She said, her tears falling down her face stained with <em>Pepsi.<br/>
</em></p><p>The kiss mark that Agatha had left on her chest was ruined now.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha jerked her head back. “Rio?”<br/>
</p><p>“Leave me alone!” Rio yelled before she headed for the garden next to them.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha and Jen followed suit.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda scoffed before she turned on her heels and ventured further into the house.<br/>
</p><p>“Wanda!” Agatha called. The redhead didn’t stop. “Wanda!” She caught her arm in the corridor and turned her around. “What the fuck was that?!”<br/>
</p><p>She shrugged. “Nothing.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, come off it. Why the hell did you do that?”<br/>
</p><p>“I like you,” Wanda blurted out.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled a face. Did Wanda think it was appropriate to tell her that <em>now<em>, when she’d just thrown a drink on Rio?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Why did you throw your drink in Rio’s face?”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda scoffed again. “<em>That’s<em> what you have to say after I tell you something like that?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Answer my fucking question,” Agatha demanded.<br/>
</p><p>“I threw it on her because she deserved it, okay?” Wanda replied nonchalantly.<br/>
</p><p>“What’d she do?”<br/>
</p><p>“Does it matter?!” Wanda snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes!” Agatha seethed. “Oh, you know what, fuck this. I’m asking her.”<br/>
</p><p>“She won’t want to talk to you,” Wanda sing-songed.<br/>
</p><p>She’d said it with such finality that it made Agatha’s stomach drop.<br/>
</p><p>She ignored the feeling and Wanda’s calls as she made her way back to the garden.<br/>
</p><p>It was mostly empty, just a few people dotted around smoking weed or cigarettes. Upon first glance, she couldn’t find her friends or the princess. The garden was too dark to see anything properly. Agatha walked further in and came to understand just how far the garden stretched. That’s when she spotted Alice and Rio down the other end.<br/>
</p><p>She had to squint to see them; the light from the house didn’t reach that far.<br/>
</p><p>They were leaning in close as if Alice was trying to stop her best friend from crying. A wave of sadness washed over Agatha at the thought of that, of Rio crying.<br/>
</p><p>As she got closer, Agatha realised that it wasn’t Alice, it was Jen in Alice’s clothes. And they weren’t just leaning into each other…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>…There’s no fucking way.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>They were kissing.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Well, that was definitely…something…<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed before she headed back inside the house. She didn’t care that her best friend was making out with the princess, why would she? She didn’t give a fuck about Rio-Sofia. She was just someone she liked to toy with, and she was certain Rio-Sofia felt the same.<br/>
</p><p>Sure, she’d told Agatha that <em>she wanted her<em> whatever the fuck that meant. She was obviously over it because she was necking off her best friend.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She stumbled, almost smacking her hip against the drinks table, when arms caught her. She looked up to see Izzy again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha straightened, and Izzy took her hands off her.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you following me?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Izzy replied.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged; she liked honesty. “Wanna go back to your place?”<br/>
</p><p>Izzy nodded eagerly.<br/>
</p><p>“Show the princess the way,” Agatha said, waving her hand in front of her.<br/>
</p><p>Izzy took her by the hand and dragged her out of the party.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had been sufficiently fucked.<br/>
</p><p>It was the next morning, and she was lying half-naked and spent in Izzy’s bed. Her hair was a mess, she still had her makeup from last night on, and her princess costume had been tossed carelessly about the place.<br/>
</p><p>She glanced at Izzy, who was panting next to her, her arm around Agatha’s body. She rolled her eyes and threw it off her. She wanted to go home now…or did she? She didn’t want to see Rio-Sofia. Jen, she didn’t care about; she and the princess weren’t a thing, her best friend had every right to kiss her if she wanted to.<br/>
</p><p>But Rio-Sofia…now with a clearer head, Wanda’s words screamed in her mind, <em>she won’t want to talk to you<em>. And she hadn’t. She’d literally told Agatha not to touch her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>When it happened, Agatha hated to admit it, but it hurt.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia <em>always<em> wanted her to touch her. Had begged her to, in fact.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>What had changed? Wait…I don’t care.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t care.<br/>
</p><p>“Got any clothes I can borrow? I don’t wanna go out in my costume,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>“Top drawer,” Izzy nodded.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha slid off the bed and went to it. She dug inside the drawer until she found a top that said, ‘Lesbians eat what?’ with a cat beneath it, and some grey joggers. She tugged them on as well as her shoes and grabbed her phone<br/>
</p><p>“Walk me to the door?”<br/>
</p><p>Izzy nodded and pulled on some shorts and a sports bra. “You don’t want your costume?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Nah, keep it. Call it a souvenir.”<br/>
</p><p>Izzy laughed before she picked up Agatha’s tiara.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha froze as Izzy placed it atop her head. “You should keep that, though. It was made for you.”<br/>
</p><p>Actually, it was made for Rio-Sofia. And because of that, it could burn for all Agatha cared.<br/>
</p><p>But she didn’t say this, no, she just nodded and walked to Izzy’s bedroom door, down the corridor, and to her front door.<br/>
</p><p>“See you around?” Izzy asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “London’s a small place,” she quipped.<br/>
</p><p>Izzy smiled before she planted a kiss on her cheek as Agatha pulled the door open.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you fucking with me?”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, of course.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The blonde from a few weeks ago, Izzy’s ex-girlfriend…the girl who punched her in the face.<br/>
</p><p>Izzy’s jaw dropped before she said, “What the fuck are you doing here?”<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck is <em>she<em> doing here?!” The blonde shrieked as she pointed at Agatha.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha rocked on her heels…this was fun.<br/>
</p><p>“I was coming back here to tell you I still loved you! That I wanted you back! And I come to find her leaving your flat?!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha let out a low whistle. “Not a good start, Iz.”<br/>
</p><p>“I…erm…” Izzy stuttered.<br/>
</p><p>The blonde glared at her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha clapped her hands. “Welp…this has been fun, but I gotta go. Thanks for the good fuck, Iz. Call me,” Agatha winked.<br/>
</p><p>The blonde seethed and lunged for her as if she might punch her again. Agatha dodged it before Izzy grabbed her ex.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha, get out of here before she hurts you!” Izzy yelled as she restrained her ex, who was thrashing around in her arms like a dog with rabies.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t have to tell me twice,” she walked out the door and called behind her, “I hope you two work it out!”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m gonna kill the bitch,” Izzy’s ex yelled.<br/>
</p><p>“Lizzie calm the fuck down!” Izzy said as the door shut behind them.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was feeling particularly menacing today…she was also still a little drunk from last night.<br/>
</p><p>Why should other people get to be happy with their girlfriends when the girl she wanted…wait…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I don’t want anyone.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>That’s right. Agatha didn't want anyone.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>She almost missed her stop getting off the tube. She’d fallen asleep, and it was only a man bumping his briefcase into her leg that woke her up. Would you look at that…a man had been good for something, when did that ever happen?<br/>
</p><p>She tapped out at Euston Square Station and sluggishly made the short walk to her accommodation, where she locked eyes with…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, for fucksake.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Bloody brilliant,” Agatha muttered.<br/>
</p><p>…her mother.<br/>
</p><p>Evanora gaped at her. It wasn’t great. The one time her mother had decided to visit Agatha she was still in yesterday’s makeup, hair a mess and wearing a top that said lesbians ate pussy…oh, and she still had her tiara on.<br/>
</p><p>“What in god’s name,” Evanora blinked.<br/>
</p><p>Yeah…it really wasn’t great.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t bother fixing her appearance, she didn’t care, and she needed her mother to fuck off.<br/>
</p><p>“Mother! What are you doing here?” Agatha asked with mock enthusiasm.<br/>
</p><p>“I was coming to make sure you hadn’t formed a stronger bond with the devil, but it appears you already have.”<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” Agatha nodded. “Yep, me and the devil are real close now,” she crossed her fingers to emphasise her point. “So, you probably shouldn’t be around me. In fact, you should go home so that you don’t catch what I’ve got.”<br/>
</p><p>Evanora clutched the cross necklace around her neck. “The lord will always protect me. Take me up to your room this instant!” Evanora demanded.<br/>
</p><p>“Ooo…” Agatha started. “I’m not sure that’s a good idea. I’m on the fifth floor, you hate heights.”<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha!” Evanora shrieked. “Let me up right now before I slap you right here in the middle of the street in front of all these people.”<br/>
</p><p>“Do it,” Agatha challenged. “Someone will call the police on you.”<br/>
</p><p>Evanora lowered her voice. “If you do not follow my orders, you will get far worse than a measly little slap. Sure, people <em>could<em> call the police, but you’ll certainly end up in a hospital bed.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha swallowed. That drained the fight out of her and sobered her up.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, mother.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tapped her key card against her accommodation door and let her mother inside. They went up to the fifth floor in silence and continued that way until Agatha opened her bedroom door.<br/>
</p><p>Her room was still a mess.<br/>
</p><p>Evanora walked in, her face twisted with horror as she took in the posters of lesbian art, Agatha’s new clothes scattered across the floor and the new photos she’d added to her photo board. A lot of them (most) were from club photobooths. The girls were all drunk and all doing ‘inappropriate’ hand actions, or kissing, or something like that.<br/>
</p><p>There wasn’t any warning. Evanora turned around and slapped her. Agatha’s head snapped to the side from the blow, her tiara flying off. Gingerly, she brought her hand up to cradle the now tender skin.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m bringing you home,” Evanora told her calmly. “You will not continue with university.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened as tears began to well.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha whispered. “You can’t-”<br/>
</p><p>“Can’t what?” Evanora snapped as she began ripping Agatha’s posters off her walls and shredding them into pieces.<br/>
</p><p>“Mother,” Agatha tried to reason. “Mother, <em>please<em>. Stop it!”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Evil, evil, evil,” Evanora muttered under her breath as she tore down more posters. “Evil. Devil’s spawn. Evil.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>You’re not evil, you’re not evil, you’re not evil.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha reminded herself.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Don’t listen to her, you’re not.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>When Evanora turned her attention to Agatha’s photo board, she produced a slow grin before she surged forward and yanked as many photos as she could from it.<br/>
</p><p>“Mother!” Agatha yelled as she tried to stop her.<br/>
</p><p>Evanora shoved her back with so much force that she hit the wall behind her. Her head smacked against it, and Agatha stumbled. Black spots clouded her vision.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha straightened, her free hand going to rest on her head to soothe it.<br/>
</p><p>Her mother kept going, kept ripping up the photos, kept stomping on them as if they were insects that needed killing, kept spitting on them like they were on fire and needed to be put out.<br/>
</p><p>When Evanora’s eyes landed on Señor Scratchy, Agatha’s heart dropped.<br/>
</p><p>Evanora scoffed. “You still have this?” She lifted the stuffed bunny. “You killed him, you know? Your father? That was you. You were so evil that it killed him.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha bit her lip as more tears fell. “Please,” Agatha pleaded. “Just…just put him down.”<br/>
</p><p>Evanora held her gaze for a long moment before she said, “Okay, sweetheart.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted as her mother tore the only thing her father had ever given her in two.<br/>
</p><p>She was so numb now that she couldn’t even scream.<br/>
</p><p>She watched as the fluff spilt out onto her messy bedroom floor.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was no longer surprised when her mother grabbed a pair of scissors off her desk and grabbed at the first piece of clothing she could. It was a black tank top.<br/>
</p><p>“And where did you get all of these horrendous clothes from?” Her mother shrieked as she sliced through it.<br/>
</p><p>She let the ruined item fall to the ground before she leaned over and picked up a dark grey hoodie.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>But it wasn’t just any dark grey hoodie, it was Rio-Sofia’s.<br/>
</p><p>“No! No, not that,” Agatha yelled as she snatched it from her mother’s grasp just before she cut into it.<br/>
</p><p>Evanora’s hand holding the scissors shook with rage.<br/>
</p><p>She lunged for Agatha then, yanking her by her hair and twisting it into a tight knot as she pulled her down.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha bit her lip so she wouldn’t scream.<br/>
</p><p>“And what’s so special about that, huh?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply, just kept the jumper behind her back as her mother continued to pull.<br/>
</p><p>“You make me so unbelievably <em>sick<em>, Agatha,” her mother spat.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha knew she was trembling. She wanted to stop, wanted to fight it, but she could feel her hair being ripped from her scalp.<br/>
</p><p>“You show up here smelling like alcohol, your makeup done like a whore, a shirt with the most vile statement I have ever read in my life on it.” Evanora scoffed. “You will <em>rot<em> in hell, daughter.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She brought the scissors up to Agatha’s face then, and for a split second, Agatha thought her mother might cut her with them.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t, just hacked off large pieces of Agatha’s hair.<br/>
</p><p>It tumbled to the floor, resting next to the remains of her stuffed bunny, shredded photos and the cut-up piece of clothing that Rio-Sofia bought her.<br/>
</p><p>Evanora released her then, and Agatha’s hand flew up to grab at the hair that was no longer there. Her hair was one of her favourite things about herself. She’d grown it out for forever; it was long, healthy and thick.<br/>
</p><p>“Try whoring around with hair like that plus your croaked nose,” Evanora snapped. She yanked her by the hair again. “I will return, and when I do, I will make sure you are leaving with me.”<br/>
</p><p>Her mother shoved her out of the way and left.<br/>
</p><p>Left Agatha in her room with her shredded things. Left her bruised and exhausted. Left her with the fear that she might return.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t be in her room anymore.<br/>
</p><p>She walked out into the corridor.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha? Are you okay?” Lucia asked.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t reply, tears blurring her vision as she left the flat.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had walked until she ended up at Primrose Hill. There weren’t many people about, which she guessed made sense for 10 AM on a Friday.<br/>
</p><p>She’d put on Rio’s hoodie and pulled it around her knees, which were pressed against her chest, the hood up. And stared down the steep hill and the London skyline ahead.<br/>
</p><p>She’d stopped crying now, but her face and head still hurt. She hadn’t seen her hair yet, she didn’t want to know. There would be no saving it, and she could only handle one devastating truth at a time.<br/>
</p><p>She felt movement from behind her until someone sat next to her.<br/>
</p><p>“What happened?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>She thought she wasn’t mad at her best friend for kissing Rio-Sofia…but now, as Jen sat next to her…maybe she was.<br/>
</p><p>“Talk to me, babe,” Jen urged softly.<br/>
</p><p>“How’d you even find me?” Agatha asked, her voice hoarse from all the crying.<br/>
</p><p>Jen pulled out her phone and wiggled it. “<em>Life 360<em> is a godsend.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Remind me to turn that off whenever I want to be alone.”<br/>
</p><p>“Nah, then I would’ve asked Lucia to track you down. She and Rio were the ones who told me you were upset in the first place.”<br/>
</p><p>“She still cares?” Agatha mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>Because at the end of last night, the princess wanted nothing to do with her.<br/>
</p><p>“Huh?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt the tears welling in her eyes again, at the mention of Rio, at Jen mentioning her. She couldn’t stop the words tumbling out of her mouth:<br/>
</p><p>“Jen, why did you kiss her?” She turned to face her best friend for the first time since she sat down.<br/>
</p><p>“What happened to your face?” Jen shrieked, her eyes scanning it as she reached out to touch her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha batted her hands away. “Jen, answer my fucking question!”<br/>
</p><p>“What question? Mines is more important, what the <em>fuck<em> happened?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Jen-”<br/>
</p><p>Her best friend cut her off. “No! Who did that to you? Tell me,” Jen demanded.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha huffed before she turned away from her. “My mother came and paid me a visit.”<br/>
</p><p>She felt Jen tense next to her.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to fucking kill her!” Jen yelled, which earned her a few glances from the other people sitting on the hill. Jen didn’t care. “Why the fuck did she do that? You didn’t even do anything!”<br/>
</p><p>Jen wouldn’t have known that, but her best friend had a tendency to believe Agatha was always in the right about everything she got herself into, unless it was truly diabolical, then Jen wouldn’t back her. She’d be screaming at her instead.<br/>
</p><p>“Can we get you a restraining order? So, she can’t go anywhere near you?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed for the first time all day. “Restraining orders are near impossible to obtain, especially in the UK.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, but I feel like this is a special case.”<br/>
</p><p>“But wait,” Agatha said, beginning to pull down her hood. “It gets worse.”<br/>
</p><p>When she’d pulled the hood all the way down, Jen gasped, her hands flying to her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>Her best friend just blinked at her, and it was all Agatha needed. She knew…but Jen had really confirmed how bad it was.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Yup. Not great-”<br/>
</p><p>“Layers!” Jen cut in. “Yep, that’s it. You’re getting layers…like, right the fuck now. I can’t be seen out with you looking like that.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen went to stand when Agatha dragged her down again.<br/>
</p><p>“My question first. Why did you kiss Rio-Sofia?”<br/>
</p><p>Jen blinked at her. “Why did I…<em>what?”<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha groaned. She didn’t want to have to ask for the third time. “You bloody well heard me. Tell me why.”<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs…are you on crack cocaine? Why would I-”<br/>
</p><p>“I saw you!” Agatha interrupted. “After Wanda threw her drink on Rio-Sofia, and you were in the garden.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen tilted her head up as if trying to recall a memory before she burst out laughing.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Kiss her?<em> Aggs, we weren’t fucking kissing. I was comforting her whilst Nat went to find Alice.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“But I-”<br/>
</p><p>“No, you fucking didn’t,” Jen cackled. “One it was dark, and you weren’t wearing your glasses, two you were off your fucking face and three, me and Alice are literally dating. Why would I kiss my girlfriend’s best friend?”<br/>
</p><p>It was Agatha’s turn to blink.<br/>
</p><p>Now that she thought about it…she hadn’t actually <em>seen<em> any kissing. She’d just seen two heads close together, and her drunken mind had assumed the worst.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Oh…”<br/>
</p><p>“…Yeah,” Jen laughed. “Would you have cared if we were?”<br/>
</p><p>The question had caught her so off guard that Agatha choked on her spit. “Why didn’t you tell me you and Alice started dating?” Agatha asked, changing the subject.<br/>
</p><p>She knew her best friend and knew she would jump at the chance to yap about Alice.<br/>
</p><p>“Because she asked me yesterday, and you were locked in your room all day plotting for Halloween.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled her phone out of her pocket. “We have things called iPhones; you also live in the same flat as me.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen waved her off. “Now up, we gotta get you to a hair salon…like now.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed before she allowed her best friend to help her up.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Was Agatha fucking serious?<br/>
</p><p>Rio had just been on her knees in the bathroom for her, ready to give her everything she wanted. But of course, she couldn’t allow Rio to do that. Of course, she had to be stubborn and not touch Rio, which Rio knew she wanted to do.<br/>
</p><p>No, instead, Agatha was making out with some girl down the hall. Her eyes opened, fixed on Rio as she basically inhaled the other girl. Rio tightened her grip around her cup, her anger building slowly, the more Agatha’s eyes sparkled with mischief.<br/>
</p><p>She broke eye contact to pull the girl down the corridor and into the bathroom. The same bathroom Rio had just been giving her head in.<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed because of fucking course.<br/>
</p><p>She knocked her drink back, ready to make another when she felt a tap on her shoulder. Rio turned. Wanda.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, hey,” she smiled. “What’s up?”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda smiled back. “Nothing. I gotta talk to you though.”<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Rio replied as she followed Wanda out into the fairly empty, barely lit garden.<br/>
</p><p>Rio watched as Wanda clicked away at her phone until she turned it around to a photo of her and Natasha dancing.<br/>
</p><p>“Aw!” Rio said as she took Wanda’s phone. “These are so cute! Thanks for taking them.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda grinned. “Keep swiping.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio did. There were more photos of her and Natasha. With every swipe, they got closer and closer until…they were kissing.<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked up with her eyebrows furrowed. “Why’d you take this one?”<br/>
</p><p>“To send to every tabloid if you don’t do what I say.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio froze. Her hand clenching around Wanda’s phone. If she was quick enough, she could delete them. But she hesitated, and the redhead snatched her phone back.<br/>
</p><p>“So stupid. Caught kissing a woman <em>again<em>. That wasn’t very smart, Rio-Sofia.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio stared at her for a long moment until she burst out laughing.<br/>
</p><p>“Good one, Wanda. You had me there for a moment.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m being serious,” Wanda snapped, her gaze stern.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s smile wavered until she laughed again. “But you wouldn’t actually do that.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda’s gaze was unmoving.<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked at her. “You know that’s fucked…right?” She emphasised the last word so that Wanda truly understood how insane she sounded.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck around and find out,” Wanda replied simply.<br/>
</p><p>Rio jerked her head back, her stomach beginning to twist as her new reality set in. “But…but why?” Rio stuttered. “I haven’t done <em>anything<em> to you!”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, no. Please enlighten me.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda said nothing.<br/>
</p><p>“Go on then!” Rio urged.<br/>
</p><p>The redhead stepped closer, her voice dropping low. “Stay away from her. You’re not to touch her, don’t even look at her if you can help it.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Her? Who’s…oh.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>And it all made sense now.<br/>
</p><p>“This is about fucking Agatha?!” Rio whisper yelled. She threw her head back and laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda tilted her head to the side, the action sinister, precise. “I just threatened to ruin your life again, and you’re laughing?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m laughing at how psycho this is. You’re doing all this for a girl who doesn’t even want me? Agatha has the attention of most of London, and you’re going after me?! If this is a jealousy thing, Wanda, you’re going to have to find dirt on a lot more people if you want them to stay away from her.”<br/>
</p><p>“This isn’t about most of London, this is about you!” Wanda snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“But <em>why<em>? We toy with each other, we play games, Agatha doesn’t actually want me!”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Yes, she-” Wanda cut herself off, breathing in deeply as if to calm herself down. “Do you agree to stay away from her?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda produced a tight smile before she tapped at her phone. When she turned it around, <em>Instagram<em> was up, the photo of Natasha and Rio kissing ready to be uploaded.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio’s body stiffened.<br/>
</p><p>It really did seem like Wanda would do it. And as much as Rio wanted to call her bluff, if she did press send, it would be back to square one. It would be another speech where she would be forced to say things she didn’t mean. She would be ripped from her home again, yet this time she’d be going to conversion therapy. She’d have to go months instead of weeks without talking to her siblings.<br/>
</p><p>London had been hell at first, but she always had Alice. She’d found her friends, the hockey society, she had Lucia.<br/>
</p><p>Had Agatha…well…at least she used to.<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t restart. So, because of this, she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Yes.” But it was weak, and her voice cracked.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda nodded with a grin. “Good. Tell anyone about this, and that photo goes up.”<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t expect her to stay away from me,” Rio blurted out. “Because I’m telling you right now, she won’t.” She knew this like she knew the sun would rise in the east.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda glared at her, and Rio left her to do so, walking further into the garden.<br/>
</p><p>How could she let this happen? She knew she was being stupid, letting her desires make her lose her head in public. But she never thought someone she considered a friend would betray her like that.<br/>
</p><p>Rio felt sick.<br/>
</p><p>She’d only liked a girl. Why did liking a girl mean she got threatened? She didn’t choose to like the same one Wanda did.<br/>
</p><p>She felt like she did after the incident five months ago. Questioning why she couldn’t have been smarter, more discreet, hidden her feelings.<br/>
</p><p>Because she should just hide them, right?<br/>
</p><p>Being a lesbian, liking women had only fucked her life up. Maybe her mother was right. Maybe she should just settle down with one of the stupid men she’d been forced to go on a date with. That would keep her out of trouble.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>But you can’t let her stop you from liking who you like, Rio.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Her brother’s voice.<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked as the thought slammed into her mind.<br/>
</p><p>He had been talking about their mother…but it applied to Wanda too.<br/>
</p><p>Rio cringed at the spiral she was about to let herself fall down. The fact that she was even considering settling down with a man made her stomach clench, and she gagged. When nothing came out, she straightened up and went back inside the house.<br/>
</p><p>“Ri!” Alice screamed as she ran up to her. “Did you fuck?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows. “Who-?”<br/>
</p><p>“You and Agatha,” Alice whispered. “I saw you go into the bathroom, and you didn’t come out for a while…”<br/>
</p><p>“Shush!” Rio hushed in fear Wanda might hear<br/>
</p><p>“So did you?” Alice asked eagerly.<br/>
</p><p>“Darlin, I need help with my costume real quick.”<br/>
</p><p>Saved by the Jen.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re not done discussing this,” Alice said as her girlfriend dragged her away.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio tried to forget about the Wanda thing. She was too drunk to actually process what had happened and thought it would be best to decipher it when she wasn’t off her face. Plus, it was still Halloween and Rio had been having a good night before Wanda ruined it.<br/>
</p><p>She decided she wouldn’t let her.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha had offered to make her one of her ‘special drinks,’ which just meant she was going to pour half a bottle of vodka into a cup and add a dash of whatever mixer she felt like.<br/>
</p><p>Jen was helping too, when Wanda appeared.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you fucking serious?” Wanda shrieked.<br/>
</p><p>Jen furrowed her eyebrows. “About what? What’s going on?”<br/>
</p><p>“Alice just told me what you guys did,” Wanda continued.<br/>
</p><p>Rio swallowed. Alice wouldn’t have known not to tell Wanda…no one did.<br/>
</p><p>“It was before we spoke,” Rio tried to reason.<br/>
</p><p>“Bullshit,” Wanda stepped closer, her hand tightening around her cup. “Do you want to test me, Rio-Sofia? Because I wouldn’t.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oi!” Natasha cut in. “I don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about but you’re steaming. You need to sober up.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda ignored her. “You think you can just sneak around and think I won’t find out?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio felt the tears welling in her eyes. Out of frustration for not being believed, out of betrayal, out of genuine fear that Wanda would make good on her threat.<br/>
</p><p>“It was before. It was before we spoke, I promise,” Rio got out desperately.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re such a fucking liar, Rio-Sofia.”<br/>
</p><p>And then Wanda was throwing her drink on her.<br/>
</p><p>“Wanda! What the fuck?!”<br/>
</p><p>“Are you fucking serious?” Jen and Natasha said at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked down at her soaking wet costume. The tears fell. Rio couldn’t stop them.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha?” Wanda asked in shock.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha said gently.<br/>
</p><p>Rio felt those soft hands on her for the first time all night. She looked up and was met with deep blue.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s hand tightened around Rio’s wet arm as she said, “Are you okay? Let’s get you cleaned up.”<br/>
</p><p>She caught Wanda’s eyes narrowing in her peripheral and as much as she wanted to let Agatha guide her away, she couldn’t give the ginger more ammo.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t fucking touch me!” Rio yelled, snatching her arm free.<br/>
</p><p>It physically hurt her to do so, and the tears only fell faster.<br/>
</p><p>The pained look on Agatha’s face made Rio’s stomach twist.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha sounded so betrayed.<br/>
</p><p>“Leave me alone!” Rio forced out before she headed to the garden.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, babe!” Jen called.<br/>
</p><p>Rio kept walking.<br/>
</p><p>“Ri!” Natasha yelled.<br/>
</p><p>They caught up to her, catching her arms, so she stopped.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio, what just happened?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>But Rio couldn’t stop crying.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll go get Alice and Lucia,” Natasha said.<br/>
</p><p>Jen nodded. “Hey,” she soothed. “It’s okay,” she lowered Rio onto the bench next to them and held her close.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t know how long she sobbed for or why she was doing it. Was it because a drink had been thrown at her? Was it because now, whenever Wanda felt like it, she could expose her? Was it because it wasn’t Agatha who was holding her?<br/>
</p><p>When her body stopped shuddering, she lifted her head, and Jen ran her thumbs under her eyes to wipe away her tears.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay?”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio said through a wet laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Riri, Qué pasó?” <em>Riri, what happened?<em> Alice asked, sliding onto the bench next to her, wrapping her in her arms.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“No quiero hablar.” <em>I don’t want to talk.<em> Rio mumbled into Alice’s chest.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“¿No?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“Bien.” <em>Okay.<br/>
</em></p><p>“¿Quieres ir a casa?” <em>Do you want to go home?<em> Lucia asked.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Sí,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Vamos.” <em>Come on.<em> Lucia nodded.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Alice lifted her up, pressing her body against her side as they left the party.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>She was in Natasha’s room the next morning.<br/>
</p><p>After crying into her pillow until she fell asleep, Rio didn’t feel like being alone. Alice was in Jen’s room after she had insisted she didn’t have to stay with her last night. And the one person she actually wanted for one wasn’t in the flat, and two, she wasn’t allowed to want.<br/>
</p><p>“You wanna tell me what happened last night?” Natasha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“No."<br/>
</p><p>“Ri-”<br/>
</p><p>She shook her head. “Don’t.”<br/>
</p><p>It wasn’t like she didn’t want to talk about it with someone, but the rules Wanda had set were clear. She couldn’t talk about it because if she did, the photo would be uploaded or sent to tabloids or given straight to her mother.<br/>
</p><p>She couldn’t risk it. And she knew Natasha. If she told her, she would run to Wanda’s room, bang her door down and scream at her until she sobbed.<br/>
</p><p>Then Wanda would definitely leak the photo.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha studied her for a beat before she nodded and dropped onto the bed next to her. “Would you like me to speak to Wanda?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>There was a knock on the door.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha went to open it, and Lucia stood behind it with two cups of <em>Blank Street<em> white chocolate iced matcha and pastry bags.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio smiled. “Cia, I told you, you didn’t have to get us those.”<br/>
</p><p>“You looked like you needed them,” Lucia replied.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha took them. “Thank you, Lucia.”<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio echoed.<br/>
</p><p>“No problem,” Lucia said. “I’m going to grab your metal straws from your flat.”<br/>
</p><p>She left.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m all for saving the planet, but can’t they come up with something better than paper straws?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“But do you get it? The paper gets all soggy and then your drink tastes like cardboard,” Natasha continued.<br/>
</p><p>“No, I get it,” Rio replied as she took her drink.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s phone buzzed.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled it out to a text from Lucia:<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Lucia: Agatha just ran out of the flat crying.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped. What had happened? Who had made her cry? Where was she going?<br/>
</p><p>The urge to get up and chase her down was so strong that her body twitched.<br/>
</p><p>But she couldn’t do that. She wasn’t fucking allowed.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay?” Natasha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>She did the next best thing. Texted Jen.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>It was now 4 PM, and Rio hadn’t heard a peep from Jen. Neither she nor Agatha had returned. She had to fight the urge to text Agatha, which would definitely break the rules of Wanda’s threat.<br/>
</p><p>She’d taken to stress baking. It’d been a while since she’d made her Abuela’s tres leches.<br/>
</p><p>Alice and Lucia had offered to help, and Rio had told them they could as long as they didn’t ask her what happened last night. They’d both hesitated before they complied.<br/>
</p><p>The kitchen was covered in flour, caster sugar and egg shells when their front door sounded. Footsteps followed, and Jen appeared, then so did Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Rio dropped the bowl she was holding, her lips parting as she stared at her.<br/>
</p><p>She’d gotten a haircut. Her long, dark hair was a little shorter now, and she’d added layers that curled inwards like a '90s blowout would.<br/>
</p><p>The short front pieces of her hair fell around her face to frame it, and if Rio hadn’t spent forever studying Agatha’s face, she would’ve missed the bruise on the top of her cheek that had been hidden behind her hair.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t think before she walked up to her, caught her chin and turned her head with the same care you would handle a newborn with.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tried to pull away, but Rio only tightened her grip. Agatha stopped resisting.<br/>
</p><p>Slowly, Rio brought her hand up to push away the hair concealing the bruise. She gasped when it was revealed. A nasty purple patch that stood out unmistakably against perfect pale skin.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha swallowed, and Rio released her.<br/>
</p><p>She wanted to ask:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Who the fuck did that to you? Are you okay? What happened?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She didn’t. It wasn’t allowed.<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes shifted to hers and held her gaze.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s arms twitched beside her. They wanted to reach out and touch Agatha again.<br/>
</p><p>And as she continued to fight against the desire, Agatha surged forward and hugged her, her arms circling her neck. Agatha had thrown herself forward with so much force that Rio stumbled, her hand firm against Agatha’s back so they wouldn’t fall.<br/>
</p><p>She felt the other girl nuzzle her head against her neck, felt the soft poke of Agatha’s beautiful nose against her heated skin.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wrapped the arm on Agatha’s back around her and brought her free hand up to run through Agatha's gorgeous hair.<br/>
</p><p>“Estás bien, bebe.” <em>You’re okay, baby.<em> Rio soothed.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She shouldn’t have.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t care.<br/>
</p><p>Rio felt Agatha nod as she tightened her grip around her neck.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t know how long they stayed like that, but it was only when Jen cleared her throat that Agatha pulled back a little.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, yes…because there were still other people in the kitchen. You could’ve fooled Rio. The world only felt like her and Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>She still hadn’t let go of Rio, and she was sure she wouldn’t have until their front door opened and an older woman Rio had never seen before stormed in with a moving bin rolling behind her.<br/>
</p><p>“Come on, Agatha! Let’s go!” The woman barked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows as Jen muttered:<br/>
</p><p>“She better be so fucking for real.”<br/>
</p><p>“What are you doing just standing there?” The woman continued as she walked the length of their long corridor and into the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t miss the way Agatha flinched and stepped back.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not…I’m not going,” Agatha got out.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had never heard her sound so uncertain before.<br/>
</p><p>The woman reached forward as if she might grab Agatha’s arm, and Rio didn’t hesitate to pull her behind her.<br/>
</p><p>“Who are you?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>The woman’s ice blue eyes narrowed. “Unhand her, please. She needs to pack.”<br/>
</p><p>“She’s not going with you,” Jen snapped.<br/>
</p><p>The woman’s gaze shifted to Jen, who didn’t cower. No, Agatha’s best friend stepped towards her.<br/>
</p><p>“You think you can just come in here and start ordering her around? She worked her ass off to be able to come to university. And you think you can do that to her face, to her hair, destroy her room, and she’s going to come with you?” Jen scoffed. “In your fucking dreams.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s stomach twisted. This woman did what to Agatha?<br/>
</p><p>The woman sighed. “Jennifer-”<br/>
</p><p>“No!” Jen cut her off. “Get the fuck out of here.”<br/>
</p><p>“Mother,” Agatha squeaked. “Please.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Mother?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>And now Rio was angry. Agatha’s mother had given her that bruise and done what to Agatha’s room?<br/>
</p><p>“Do not make me repeat myself. Come. With. Me-”<br/>
</p><p>“That’s assault,” Rio cut in. “You could go to jail for that.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s mother’s lips twisted into a cruel smile. “With what evidence, dear?”<br/>
</p><p>“The bruise on her face, that’s a start,” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“I am her mother. I care and love her, who would believe little old me could be capable of that?”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, as the Princess of Spain, I think I can be quite persuasive to any authorities who might think to question Agatha’s statement if she wishes to make one.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio hated pulling the princess card, but this felt necessary.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s mother’s face dropped as if she’d suddenly recognised her.<br/>
</p><p>“You look…you look different,” the old woman stuttered.<br/>
</p><p>“Is it the eyeliner?” Rio challenged.<br/>
</p><p>The old bat just stared at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Get. Out.” Rio ordered.<br/>
</p><p>Lucia came up from behind them. “Let’s go, ma’am,” she nudged Agatha’s mother down the corridor.<br/>
</p><p>When their front door clicked shut, she turned to Agatha, whose eyes were filled with unshed tears.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you,” she whispered.<br/>
</p><p>A smile slid onto Rio’s lips. “You’re being weird again. You never say thank you,” Rio teased.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed as tears spilt down her face.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>After Agatha’s mother left, she and Jen went into her room and didn’t come back out. Understandably, and probably for the best, because Rio didn’t think she could be around her without touching her again.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, Rio was so fucked.<br/>
</p><p>How the hell was she supposed to stay away from her? All she wanted to do was check on her, be there for her, talk to her. But no.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fucking Wanda.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She went back to making her tres leches cake with Alice and Lucia, making sure to focus on nothing but making it perfect. She followed her Abuela’s recipe to a T, and when they were done, she went to her room to work.<br/>
</p><p>When did Rio ever willingly do work for the degree she hated? Never. But work meant another task to do, work meant not thinking about Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>A knock on her door pulled her attention away from her laptop, which she’d been staring at for…FOUR HOURS?!<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What the hell?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Where had the time gone?<br/>
</p><p>“Come in,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>The door opened, and Agatha walked in. She was wearing black shorts and Rio’s hoodie. Her hair was tied up in a high ponytail, the shorter hair from her new layers that didn’t quite fit into it falling around her face to frame it.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Jesus.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha could not be in her room. Not now, and unfortunately not ever.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha said awkwardly.<br/>
</p><p>When was Agatha ever awkward?<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows before a smile split her lips. “What’s up with you?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha jerked her head back. “Nothing!” She said defensively.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Okay. What’d you come in here for?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha parted her lips as if to speak twice before she said. “You know what, never mind.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned to leave; she’d made it to the door before she spun around again.<br/>
</p><p>“Nope. That was too easy.” She walked back into the room. “Where’s the fight? Where’s the begging me to stay?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay…now what’s up with you?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Some psycho bitch is blackmailing me and now I can’t be around you.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Did I say something was up with me?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, stepping closer to Rio, sitting at her desk.<br/>
</p><p>Rio held her gaze and shouldn’t have; those knots deep in her stomach started to twist, and she tore her eyes away, returning her attention to her laptop.<br/>
</p><p>Well…until Agatha grabbed the back of her desk chair and spun her around. Her hands going to either of the armrests, so Agatha was bracketing her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked up into deep blue and almost drowned.<br/>
</p><p>“I came to say thank you again,” Agatha said, her voice low and silky.<br/>
</p><p>Rio willed herself not to swallow. “You’re welcome. Your mother’s a bitch.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snorted, and a smile spread across Rio’s lips. Agatha snorted?<br/>
</p><p>“That she is.”<br/>
</p><p>She held Rio’s gaze for a long moment, letting the silence wash over them as their smiles faded and the air grew thick with want.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve been thinking…” Agatha started before Rio shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t think.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha quirked an eyebrow. “That’ll be hard for me, darlin. I’m quite the genius.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio fought the urge to smile, her eyes rolling playfully. She turned her head before it snapped back towards the brunette when Rio felt her weight on her lap.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was straddling her…Agatha couldn’t do that.<br/>
</p><p>Rio went to push her off when Agatha said:<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t fight me. We both know you can’t.”<br/>
</p><p>And boy was she right. But for the sake of Rio not flipping her life upside down, she had to try.<br/>
</p><p>She leaned forward. “I could if I wanted to.”<br/>
</p><p>Wrong move. Now she and Agatha were close…too close. Rio could feel her heated breath against her skin.<br/>
</p><p>“But you don’t want to,” Agatha replied simply. “Who was on their knees for me last night?”<br/>
</p><p>“Me,” Rio replied nonchalantly. “But who didn’t come because they didn’t touch me?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m touching you now, aren’t I? How’s this?” Agatha shifted, inching up Rio’s body until her cunt was pressed against Rio’s.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio let out a breathy laugh. “Who knew all it took was for me to come to your rescue? Maybe I really am your knight in shining armour.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Stop it. Stop playing the game before you fuck your life up.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio ignored the warnings she was giving herself.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha hummed, her hand coming up to dance her fingers along the side of Rio’s neck. “Maybe.”<br/>
</p><p>Her touch felt like lightning bolts. Dangerous yet energising.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Stop this.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio blinked. Yeah, no. She couldn’t fuck her life up.<br/>
</p><p>In an attempt to defuse the tension, Rio said:<br/>
</p><p>“I’m never getting that hoodie back, am I?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked down at the dark grey <em>Carhartt<em> hoodie she was wearing.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She quirked an eyebrow. “You want it back?”<br/>
</p><p>Before Rio could reply, she was shrugging it off, pulling the jumper over her head to reveal the top underneath…except it wasn’t a top. Nope, it was a dark purple bralette.<br/>
</p><p>Rio swallowed at the expanse of skin. She forced herself to not look down at Agatha’s tits.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tossed the hoodie on Rio’s bed carelessly. “There. Now it’s yours again.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio could only nod.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Stop this.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Right.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She put her hands on Agatha’s waist and lifted her off her with ease, earning her a yelp from the other girl.<br/>
</p><p>“I gotta pee,” Rio said abruptly, getting up and walking past Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Well, until Agatha caught her arm and spun her around again.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha said firmly. “You don’t.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled her arm free. “And how would you know?” Rio challenged.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stepped closer. “Why are you fighting me, Rio-Sofia?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio hated her full name, and yet on Agatha’s tongue, said like that? Rio had never loved her name more.<br/>
</p><p>“I know you want this,” Agatha continued.<br/>
</p><p>“And do you?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha held her gaze, deep blue, looking at her so intensely that Rio thought she might burn a hole through her head.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m standing half-naked in your room, what do you think?” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s-” Rio cut herself off when Agatha drew her in by the waist, her hand resting on the bare skin between her sweatpants and tank top. Rio powered through. “What’s changed?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head, a smirk painting her face. “Can’t tell you. Ruins the fun.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, going to turn away when a firm hand turned her head back.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t ruin my fun,” Agatha breathed.<br/>
</p><p>And before Rio could react, Agatha was bringing her lips to Rio’s. When her soft lips pressed against hers, she froze…because Agatha was kissing her. They weren’t drunk, they hadn’t been toying with each other, this wasn’t a dream…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Is this a dream?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio pinched herself.<br/>
</p><p>Nope. Not a dream.<br/>
</p><p>She’d been so taken aback by what was happening that she hadn’t closed her eyes yet and quickly shut them to rectify that.<br/>
</p><p>Rio hummed when Agatha slid her tongue into her mouth, the action slow and tender. She did the same, their tongues moving against each other in a slow and deliberate rhythm.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha drew her in closer, and Rio brought her hand up to run through Agatha’s hair.<br/>
</p><p>Her lips were sticky, and Rio tasted her lip balm on her tongue. Somehow, it only made the kiss better. She craved the sensation, the taste and chased it, deepening the kiss.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled back slightly but only to turn her head the other way to get a new angle, new access to Rio’s mouth. A string of saliva connected them still whilst she did so.<br/>
</p><p>One of the hands on Rio’s waist dropped to grab her ass. Rio moaned before Agatha swallowed the sound.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha walked them backwards until Rio’s knees hit the back of her bed, and they buckled, the pair collapsing on the mattress. But the kiss never broke. Rio rolled on top of Agatha, pulling her up so that she was straddling her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s hands found her ass again and they squeezed. Rio had to pull away before she suffocated. But she needed her lips on Agatha again. She dipped her head down to kiss her neck, felt the other girl sigh as she did so.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tilted her head up so that Rio could gain more access to her, and she took it in stride, kissing up the length of her neck.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Fuck<em>,” Agatha got out. “That feels…you feel…good.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio smiled against her skin before she licked up the side of her neck until she got to her earlobe and nipped it. Agatha let out a soft moan.<br/>
</p><p>“Why’s your top still on?” Agatha snapped as she reached to pull it off.<br/>
</p><p>“Good question,” Rio teased before…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Wait, fuck! Stop it!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She scrambled off Agatha, leaving the other girl panting and confused.<br/>
</p><p>“And where do you think you’re going?” Agatha demanded.<br/>
</p><p>Rio ran her hand through her hair. “Can’t.” She shook her head, waving her finger between them. “Can’t do this.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scrunched her face evidently pissed.<br/>
</p><p>“And why the fuck not?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head again.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re gonna have to do better than that, baby.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked at the pet name. She’d never called her that before, and now all Rio wanted to do was climb back on top of her and pick up where they left off.<br/>
</p><p>She snapped herself out of it. “Can’t,” she repeated. “You can’t touch me.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes before her expression relaxed and a smirk slid across her lips. “How about I don’t touch you?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s smirk was unwavering. “You trust me?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Rio replied without missing a beat.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes sparkled with mischief. “Where’s your vibrator?”<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…I…” Rio stuttered. “Top drawer,” she nodded to her bedside table.<br/>
</p><p>“Hm, that’s where I keep mine.” Agatha pulled it open, her eyebrows lifting in amusement as she turned back to Rio. “Never would’ve expected this from the princess of Spain.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s collection wasn’t crazy, just a rose toy, a magic bullet and a vibrator ring.<br/>
</p><p>“How often do you use these?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stuck her tongue in her cheek. “A lot more since I met you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “I have that effect on people. Which one am I using then?”<br/>
</p><p>“Er…”<br/>
</p><p>“On you, that is.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio gaped at her. “Vas a...vas a usar...mí...?” <em>You’re going... you’re going to use…me?<br/>
</em></p><p>Spanish because she couldn’t translate her thoughts into English. Not that she was making sense in Spanish either.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Sí. ¿Querrías eso?” <em>Yes. Would you want that?<br/>
</em></p><p>All Rio could do was blink.<br/>
</p><p>“Dijiste que no puedo tocarte.” <em>You said I can’t touch you.<em> “Next best thing.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>Think about this. This definitely isn’t allowed. What about Wanda-<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Yes.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s grin didn’t budge. “Which one do you want?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s mouth had dried out. “You pick.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly. “Acostarse.” <em>Lie down.<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio did as she was told. She could feel the new wetness in her underwear due to the anticipation. Although Agatha wasn’t going to be touching her, she’d never received before. This was the closest she’d ever gotten.<br/>
</p><p>When she was done rummaging in Rio’s drawer, Agatha started taking Rio’s sweatpants off from around her ankles, pulling at the material and encouraging Rio to lift her hips to make it easier. When Rio was rid of the clothing, Agatha climbed onto the bed, pushed Rio’s legs up until her feet were pressed into the mattress and spread open her thighs, settling into the new space.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped to Rio’s underwear, her head tilting like a curious cat’s.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re dripping, darlin. You sure you don’t want me to use my fingers…” she darted her tongue out to lick her lips. “…My tongue?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio wanted nothing more, but it wasn’t fucking allowed. Technically, this wasn’t allowed either, but Rio was too far gone.<br/>
</p><p>She nodded.<br/>
</p><p>A brief flicker of disappointment crossed Agatha’s face before she hid it behind indifference as she shrugged. “Your loss.”<br/>
</p><p>And it really was.<br/>
</p><p>“You said I can’t touch you. So slide those off for me, would you please, princess.”<br/>
</p><p>“Please?” Rio scoffed as she shifted her black <em>Calvin Kleins<em> off. “You fucking me means you use manners?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha tutted. “<em>I’m<em> not fucking you. The ring is,” she waved her left index finger in front of Rio’s face.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>When Rio’s underwear was off her body, Agatha came into view, her face looming over Rio’s. Her right arm by her head to keep herself up.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Estás segura de que quieres esto?” <em>Are you sure you want this?<em> Agatha asked softly.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio had never heard her speak to her like that before.<br/>
</p><p>Brown eyes flicked between blue, and Rio couldn’t help herself. She brought her hand up to tuck away stray strands of hair behind Agatha’s ear, her fingertips brushing against Agatha’s many earrings.<br/>
</p><p>“Sí,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha held her gaze for a moment longer as if waiting for Rio to change her mind. When Rio didn’t, she nodded.<br/>
</p><p>The low buzz of the vibrator filled the room before Rio felt Agatha’s knuckle press against her core until it was replaced by cool silicone. Rio’s back arched as Agatha pressed the ring in, the flat surface spreading her open.<br/>
</p><p>She felt the vibrations through Agatha’s hand on her inner thighs and groaned when the ring skimmed her clit.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Fuck<em>,” Rio whimpered, her eyes drifting shut.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Rio-Sofia,” Agatha whispered in her ear. “Open your eyes, baby.”<br/>
</p><p>It was like Agatha had the remote to her brain. Her eyes opened obediently.<br/>
</p><p>“There she is,” Agatha hummed as she brushed the vibrator against Rio’s clit again. “Keep them open for me, there’s a good girl.”<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes were going to drown her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped to Agatha’s lips. She watched as they parted, soft gasps escaping from her as her finger continued to move the vibrator.<br/>
</p><p>A rush of wetness leaked from Rio’s core.<br/>
</p><p>A smile spread across Agatha’s lips. “There you go. I want more of that.”<br/>
</p><p>And on command, Rio’s body reacted.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha giggled as she pressed the ring against Rio’s clit and held it there. Her body arched further, her eyes rolling back into her head.<br/>
</p><p>“Nuh, uh,” Agatha scolded. “Eyes on me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked to refocus, feeling that her eyes were welling slightly. It was pathetic, she knew, but this just felt <em>so good.<em> Would be even better if it were Agatha’s fingers, but beggars couldn’t be choosers.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The more the vibrator pressed against her clit, the tighter her body pulled. She could feel her orgasm building, slowly but surely.<br/>
</p><p>But she wanted to be filled.<br/>
</p><p>“Use your fingers,” Rio got out.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha lifted her eyebrows in amusement. “You were the one who told me I couldn’t touch you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ignore me…you always do,” Rio panted.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Nope. You laid out these rules, we’re sticking to them.”<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha! Put your fucking fingers in-”<br/>
</p><p>“Push against me,” Agatha cut her off.<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“Do it. Grind against my finger.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio hesitated before she did so. She shuddered as she felt the ring plus Agatha’s curled index inside her. It wasn’t enough, nowhere near, but it would do.<br/>
</p><p>Breathy high-pitched gasps left Rio’s mouth as she grew closer to her release.<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes stared down at her, her bottom lip between her teeth as Rio shifted beneath her. She rolled her hips slowly, not wanting to rush, wanting to drag this out for as long as possible because she knew they’d never be allowed to do this again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pressed firmer against her, and Rio whined. Her hips rolled faster without meaning to. She chased the feeling of Agatha’s knuckle running against her wet walls.<br/>
</p><p>Beads of sweat started to form on Rio’s forehead as she picked up her pace.<br/>
</p><p>“You gonna come for me, darlin?” Agatha asked breathlessly.<br/>
</p><p>As soon as she said it, Rio was pushed over the edge. A loud moan left her mouth, her back arching. Agatha’s eyes were still locked on hers, her own gasp merging with Rio’s, drowning out the buzzing.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s body twitched from the release, kept twitching because Agatha hadn’t pulled out yet, letting her ride out her orgasm.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio stopped shuddering and her body fell back onto the mattress, Agatha carefully withdrew, switching off the ring.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Estás bien?” <em>Are you okay?<em> Agatha asked softly.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Use your words, baby.”<br/>
</p><p>She caught her breath before she said. “Sí.”<br/>
</p><p>“¿Promesa?” <em>Promise?<br/>
</em></p><p>“Sí.”<br/>
</p><p>“Okay.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha got off her and Rio sat up. She was sweating buckets.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled the ring off and Rio’s jaw dropped when she sucked the wetness off her finger like she hadn’t had any water in days. Agatha didn’t break eye contact as she did so.<br/>
</p><p>She licked her lips before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“I want more.” She licked her lips again. “Will you give it to me?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes…” Rio trailed off.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>You’re already pushing your luck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio dropped her head. “Actually, no. I can’t.”<br/>
</p><p>She felt Agatha’s gaze on her, studying her as if she were trying to work Rio out. She was allowed to fuck her with a vibrating ring…but couldn’t use her mouth or fingers…even when Rio was begging her to moments before.<br/>
</p><p>“Ah,” Agatha hummed as if she had concluded. “We’re still playing, aren’t we?”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No! No, I don’t want to play anymore. I just want you!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“Huh,” Agatha scoffed. She reached over to pick up Rio’s hoodie. “I’m keeping this.”<br/>
</p><p>“Figured,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Until next round, Vidal,” Agatha said as she left the room.<br/>
</p><p>Rio groaned, flopping onto her bed when the door clicked shut.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fucking Wanda.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Now was Agatha pissed…no (yes).<br/>
</p><p>So what the princess didn’t want to fuck her. That was fine (was not fine).<br/>
</p><p>If she was being honest, she didn’t know what had come over her. She and Jen had spent the better part of three hours cleaning her room after her mother had destroyed it. She’d binned all the shredded photos and Scratchy. She couldn’t bring herself to keep him after the state he’d been left in.<br/>
</p><p>They put him in the kitchen bin. She couldn’t see his dismantled body every time she had to throw something away.<br/>
</p><p>When they were done and she’d been left alone, she’d had this startling realisation that she wanted to be around Rio…sorry, Rio-Sofia.<br/>
</p><p>Maybe it was the way she’d hugged Agatha back earlier, maybe it was the way she’d defended her. Agatha didn’t fucking know. She didn’t even know why she’d hugged her in the first place.<br/>
</p><p>She’d just touched her so tenderly, looked at her with such genuine compassion that Agatha realised that maybe it wasn’t all about toying with each other. That maybe the princess genuinely had feelings for her.<br/>
</p><p>Sure, the princess had said that she’d wanted her, but Agatha had been thinking more in a sexual way. That she wanted her body. But Agatha was starting to get the feeling that she was wrong.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t know what that meant for her. She didn’t know if she wanted the princess back in that sense. What she did know, however, was that she’d gotten an insatiable craving for Rio-Sofia. And went out to get it.<br/>
</p><p>And she got it…sort of? The princess still didn’t want her to touch her…well, she did…and then she didn’t…? But Agatha didn’t think she could leave without doing <em>something<em> with her. That’s when the thought popped into her head. Vibrator. Loophole. It wasn’t anywhere near as close as actually being inside Rio, but that was fine (not fine).<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She would respect the princess’s wishes.<br/>
</p><p>The game was the game. And it wasn’t over yet.<br/>
</p><p>She groaned before she fished out one of her vibrators from her bedside table drawer. She regretted tasting the princess; she craved her. The knot in her core was pulled so tight it almost hurt.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha collapsed on her bed and pulled her underwear down. She was going to be extra loud tonight.<br/>
</p><p>Thank fuck for thin walls.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha slept in the next day. She felt like she deserved it.<br/>
</p><p>Her body was exhausted from what her mother put her through, and then was exhausted <em>again<em> from how much she’d used her vibrator last night.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She got up and headed to the bathroom. At first, she didn’t recognise herself. The bruise on her face, the new layers in her hair.<br/>
</p><p>She wasn’t sure if she liked it at first, but the way Rio-Sofia had looked at her when she first saw her…before she noticed the bruise on her face, sold it to her…<br/>
</p><p>Not that the princess’s opinion mattered.<br/>
</p><p>She reached over to grab her toothbrush when there was a knock on her door.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha went to open it and found no one there. She furrowed her eyebrows until she looked down and saw…<br/>
</p><p>“Scratchy?”<br/>
</p><p>Her stuffed bunny was sewn back together and restuffed. There was a tag around his neck and Agatha flipped it over.<br/>
</p><p>
<em><strong>I don’t think he belongs in the bin, R.S.V.<br/>
</strong></em>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes playfully. Yes, because the princess could sew.<br/>
</p><p>She pressed her bunny against her chest and closed her bedroom door behind her.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Had Agatha sniffed some sort of drug, and now she was hallucinating? Or tripping? Or had entered some sort of alternate reality?<br/>
</p><p>Four days. Four days after she and the princess had done some form of fucking. Four days after Rio-Sofia had fixed Scratchy after her mother had torn him in two, and yet…<br/>
</p><p>The princess was avoiding her like the fucking plague.<br/>
</p><p>Yeah, Agatha must be on shrooms because there was no other way to explain this.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha knew this play, the 'come and run.' She’d written the playbook for it with all of her…activities. But she wouldn’t have expected that from Rio-Sofia because she thought the princess liked her. Truly liked her. Had she read the situation wrong?<br/>
</p><p>Every time she’d knocked on Rio-Sofia’s door, she wasn’t in, didn’t reply, or Lucia said she was busy. Agatha couldn’t even barge in after Lucia left at midnight because she’d started locking her fucking door. At lectures and seminars, she made it a point to sit as far away from Agatha as possible.<br/>
</p><p>Was this a new gameplay? Get Agatha to let her guard down a little and then make her crave her with all the time they spent apart? Well, if it was, it was bloody working. Agatha’s thoughts for the past few days had consisted of:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Rio-Sofia, la princesa de España, Rio...<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Stop it.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>So, it was safe to say that Agatha had been itching for this hockey practice on Tuesday. The one place the princess couldn’t avoid her. Kudos to the princess; she had tried. During warm up, Rio-Sofia had ran at the back of the group knowing Agatha would be at the front, during drills she partnered up with Natasha immediately…which was fine (not fine). But now as they were being split into teams for a match, there was no way she could avoid Agatha. Not when Agatha was left forward, and Rio-Sofia was left defence for the opposite team.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha finally had her caught. Well…<br/>
</p><p>“Al, can I play something else today?” Rio-Sofia asked when they’d been allocated their positions.<br/>
</p><p>Alice furrowed her eyebrows. “Like…like right defence?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia shook her head. “Maybe a forward?”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Of fucking course, so she has to be down the other end of the pitch.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Alice’s eyebrows furrowed further. “But…but you’re our best defender. We would’ve lost to QMUL last week if it weren’t for you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia parted her lips to reply before Agatha jumped in:<br/>
</p><p>“Why the sudden change of heart?”<br/>
</p><p>The princess didn’t look at her, only Alice. “I just wanted to try something new.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No, you’re trying to get away from me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Which is fine,” Natasha joined in. “You can if you-”<br/>
</p><p>“But couldn’t she try that out another day? We’ve already sorted out teams and positions, and we’re wasting time. We wanna play,” Agatha said, twisting her stick to emphasise her point.<br/>
</p><p>Alice nodded. “Yeah, you can try something new after reading week…how’s that?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia bit her lip before she reluctantly nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Brilliant! Let’s play!” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>The twenty-one girls on their pitch began to spread out, and Agatha caught Rio-Sofia’s arm before she had a chance to leave, spinning her around.<br/>
</p><p>“Not wanting to play in your usual position…what’s that about?<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia’s eyes shifted to the side nervously.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What the fuck?<em> “What was that?”<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“What was what?” The princess asked.<br/>
</p><p>“That…that…what did you just look at?” Agatha got out.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t know what you’re on about,” Rio-Sofia shrugged before she left for her position on the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha watched her with narrowed eyes as she did so.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Okay, what in the actual fuck?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha was sweating, the stray strands in her high ponytail sticking to her forehead, her shin pads rubbing uncomfortably against her shins. They had just started their second quarter, Agatha had had six shots on goal, four of them successful…why? Because the princess wasn’t defending her.<br/>
</p><p>No, in fact, Rio-Sofia was doing the complete opposite, watching Agatha dribble past her and doing nothing about it.<br/>
</p><p>It had happened again, Agatha scoring, when Alice shouted from the sideline:<br/>
</p><p>“Ri! What the fuck? Are you off your game today? Why aren’t you tackling her?”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t know,” Wanda chimed in from across the pitch. “I think she’s doing a good job.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glared at her. She still hadn’t spoken to Wanda since Halloween, since she’d thrown her drink at Rio without any explanation. It’s not like Wanda hadn’t tried to speak to her; Agatha was just avoiding her like the princess was avoiding <em>her.<br/>
</em></p><p>Now that Agatha thought about it…everything that happened had boiled down to Halloween.<br/>
</p><p>Messiest night of the year, or what?<br/>
</p><p>“Not helping ginger!” Natasha yelled from her sideline.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio-Sofia said as the girls reset for the next play.<br/>
</p><p>“You really are off your game today,” Agatha said from behind her as the princess got into position. Agatha made sure she was level with her before she whispered in her ear, “You scared of me, darlin?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t miss the way Rio-Sofia’s breath hitched before she turned, making direct eye contact with her for the first time in god knows how long. A strange feeling shot through Agatha as those brown eyes locked onto her.<br/>
</p><p>She was immediately brought back to the princess’s bedroom four days ago. Rio withering beneath her, her soft gasps as Agatha’s index ran through wet folds, the hopeless longing in her eyes as Agatha forced her to keep eye contact with her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked the thought away as Rio-Sofia stared her down.<br/>
</p><p>“Are there pigs in the sky?”<br/>
</p><p>“There she is,” Agatha smirked. “Do me a favour and play like the player I know you are. I’m getting bored, this is too easy.”<br/>
</p><p>“Maybe there really are pigs in the sky because you just complimented me,” Rio-Sofia replied.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged as she walked past, heading to her position up the pitch. “You avoid me, I give you compliments until you come back to me. Seems fair, right?” She winked.<br/>
</p><p>“Is that your play now?” Rio-Sofia called.<br/>
</p><p>“Amongst other things,” Agatha called back.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia was finally playing like she usually did. Agatha hadn’t scored a goal since they’d spoken.<br/>
</p><p>She’d received the ball from Jen halfway up the pitch and was dribbling towards the D when Rio-Sofia appeared before her. Agatha smirked around her gumshield. She didn’t bother doing a dummy pass to herself, or dribbling around the princess, nope. She let the princess tackle her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha lost the ball, let Rio-Sofia dribble a little away, preparing for a slap pass, when Agatha ran in front of her as soon as her stick connected with the ball. Because of how powerful Rio-Sofia’s slap passes usually were, the ball lifted off the air an inch, hitting Agatha just above her shinpad.<br/>
</p><p>“Ow!” Agatha shrieked as she collapsed to the ground.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia dropped her stick immediately, rushing to her aid.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you okay?” She asked, as Agatha held her shin.<br/>
</p><p>“No! You just lobbed a hockey at me! I thought we passed that, Rio-Sofia.”<br/>
</p><p>The princess rolled her eyes. “What were you doing walking in direct line of a slap pass without your stick down anyway?” She snapped. Her expression softened the more she took in Agatha cradling her injury. “Does it hurt?” She asked softly.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs, you okay?” Alice asked when she’d gotten to them.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you want an ice pack?”<br/>
</p><p>“Please,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay. Let me get one of the reserves to ref and I’ll sit with you in the dugout,” Alice told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Can Rio-Sofia do it…please? I mean, she did injure me,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>She caught the princess rolling her eyes again, and she had to fight to stifle her smirk.<br/>
</p><p>Alice turned to her best friend, a hesitant look in her eyes. “¿Te parecería bien?” <em>Would that be okay with you?<br/>
</em></p><p>“She speaks Spanish, Al. She knows what you said. Yeah, that’s fine,” Rio-Sofia replied.<br/>
</p><p>Alice’s eyes darted between the pair before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, I’ll get the reserves to sub.” Alice left to do so.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia nodded to the dugout. “Come on then.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Can’t. You’re going to have to help me up.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia raised an eyebrow. “You can’t walk? I didn’t hit you that hard.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “It just…it <em>really<em> hurts.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The princess muttered Spanish under her breath that Agatha didn’t catch before she went to help her off the ground.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha caught her best friend looking at her from down the pitch, her head shaking playfully because Jen could always see right through her.<br/>
</p><p>She put almost her entire body weight on Rio-Sofia as she began to limp to the dugouts. Agatha was aware she was being eye-stabbingly slow, but the longer she could go with Rio-Sofia touching her, the better.<br/>
</p><p>“Not to be an ass because I know you just got injured, but is there anyway you could…hurry up? You’re stopping the gameplay,” Natasha said from the sidelines.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m so sorry, Nat. I just – ow!” Agatha exclaimed as she put her ‘injured’ leg down. “It just hurts.”<br/>
</p><p>She heard the princess huff before she bent down and scooped Agatha up bridal style. Agatha yelped, clinging onto Rio-Sofia’s neck as she carried her off the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>“Thanks, Ri!” Natasha called before she blew the whistle, and the game began again.<br/>
</p><p>Once they’d made it to the dugout, Rio-Sofia lowered Agatha gently to the ground. Agatha found herself reluctant to let go of the princess. She wanted to hold her forever.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Wait, huh? What the fuck, why do I want to do that?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Dark brown eyes held her gaze before slowly extracting Agatha’s hands from around her neck. Agatha resisted, but eventually she gave in and let Rio…sorry, Rio-Sofia detach her from her body.<br/>
</p><p>“You can’t stand, remember?” The princess teased.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha should’ve said something witty back, should’ve insulted her or <em>something.<em> Instead, she found herself looking up at the princess through her eyelashes. Found herself itching to reach out and touch her again.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>God, she’s beautiful.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Maybe it was the eyeliner that Rio-Sofia always wore on her lids and waterline that looked better today than any other, maybe it was the way her ponytail had come loose from playing hockey, maybe it was the fact that Agatha had to tilt her head up to look at her.<br/>
</p><p>Or maybe Agatha was falling for the princess…<em>hard.<br/>
</em></p><p>
<em>I’m not falling for her!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Sit,” Rio-Sofia ordered. “Whilst I get you an ice pack.”<br/>
</p><p>And because Agatha was so caught up in everything that was Rio-Sofia, she actually listened.<br/>
</p><p>The princess went to fetch one and returned moments later. Her hand reached out as if she wanted to put the ice pack on Agatha’s leg, but stopped herself, handing it to Agatha instead.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Why?<em> Rio-Sofia had no problem touching her. Why was she now so reluctant to do so?<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>Agatha snatched the ice pack from her hand because now she was pissed. It was probably a game play, but Agatha didn’t want to play-<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Shut up!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“How’s your leg?”<br/>
</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>The princess nodded once. “Okay, well, I think I’m going to go play again-”<br/>
</p><p>“Like hell you are,” Agatha cut her off. “Sit.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia’s eyes darted onto the pitch again.<br/>
</p><p>“Who do you keep looking at?!” Agatha demanded.<br/>
</p><p>“No one!”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re so fucking annoying,” Agatha muttered.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Rio-Sofia laughed. “I’m going back on the pitch-”<br/>
</p><p>“No, wait!” Agatha said hastily, grabbing onto the princess’s wrist so she couldn’t leave. “Don’t…<em>please?<em>”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio-Sofia’s eyes dropped to Agatha’s hand holding on to her. “<em>Please?<em> Are you begging, Miss Harkness?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Only for you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia’s jaw dropped.<br/>
</p><p>This is where Agatha would usually smirk because she’d gotten the upper hand, but now she was just confused because <em>why the hell<em> had she said that?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She pulled her hand away and turned away from her.<br/>
</p><p>“Got ahead of yourself there, didn’t you?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t need to see the princess to know that she was smirking.<br/>
</p><p>“Just sit down, would you?” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia did as she was told.<br/>
</p><p>They sat in a long silence, watching the game before them. Every so often, Jen would run past with a smirk, and Agatha had to resist the urge to flip her off. Wanda would jog past too, a smile on her face until it dropped the second her gaze landed on Rio-Sofia.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wondered what the fuck had happened between the pair why Wanda specifically had it out for the princess.<br/>
</p><p>“I never actually hurt you, did I?” Rio-Sofia said into the near silence.<br/>
</p><p>“Nope,” Agatha said simply.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia scoffed. “Course.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re avoiding me,” Agatha stated.<br/>
</p><p>The princess turned to her then, her face twisted in an expression Agatha couldn’t place. What was that…desperation? Longing? Before she steeled herself.<br/>
</p><p>“Correct,” Rio-Sofia said matter-of-factly.<br/>
</p><p>“Why?” And it came out too quietly for Agatha’s liking.<br/>
</p><p>The princess’s eyebrows pinched at that, at how <em>hurt<em> Agatha sounded.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio held her gaze for a long moment before…<br/>
</p><p>“Ri! Get your ass back on the pitch we’re loosing badly without you!” Kate yelled. She turned to the substitute. “Sorry, girl. But we need the best.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia nodded, leaving Agatha without another word.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fucking Wanda.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Because of the ginger bitch, Rio had, had to avoid Agatha like the plague. She felt she deserved a medal for the restraint she was showing. With the help of Lucia, she’d managed to stay away from her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s blood boiled every time Agatha would knock on her door, and she had to pretend she wasn’t in or that Agatha didn’t exist. Because it was Wanda’s fault she couldn’t touch, kiss, or fuck the only girl that would ever matter.<br/>
</p><p>Apart from on Tuesday at hockey practice, Rio hadn’t spoken to her. When Agatha had told her she was avoiding her, all Rio wanted to do was explain, point the blame at Wanda and be done with it.<br/>
</p><p>She couldn’t. She <em>could not<em> fuck her life up again. Maybe if it were clear that Agatha actually wanted her, then it would be worth it. But nothing was ever clear with Agatha. It was all fog and cloudy skies.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>As of now, on the Thursday, she was with Alice in a tattoo shop. Her best friend had spoken about getting this tattoo that all the women in her family had for the longest while, and today was the day. Rio offered to go with her. She needed something to do other than think about Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s up with you?” Alice asked from the tattoo chair. The tattoo was halfway done now.<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing.”<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t give me that,” Alice said. “You’ve been off since Halloween.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m still hungover from Halloween,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>Alice burst out laughing, which earned her a glare from the tattoo artist. “Sorry,” she apologised. “You bounce back so fast don’t give me that shit. Do you remember Carlos’ eighteenth birthday?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled at the memory.<br/>
</p><p>Alice was the only friend of Rio’s that Carlos had invited that year. He told her it was a big number to turn and wanted as few of his little sister’s friends there as possible. Rio didn’t mind as long as she had Alice, which her brother had told her was the only person he wanted to invite.<br/>
</p><p>Alice was adored by all of her family members. Sometimes it felt like she was just another one of her siblings.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos’ eighteenth birthday had been pure and utter chaos. They’d started drinking at 9 AM and continued to do so until 9 the next morning. They’d had less than 24 hours to recover before they had to do it all over again, except this time on a yacht.<br/>
</p><p>The queen hadn’t wanted Rio or Alice to go, considering they were sixteen, but Carlos had gotten his way because he always did.<br/>
</p><p>“I bounced back because I chugged two litres of water and then slept for ten hours, which <em>you<em> didn’t do even though I told you to.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Alice laughed again, earning her yet another scowl from her tattoo artist.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio darted her eyes about the place, taking in the various tattoo designs and the piercings they offered.<br/>
</p><p>“You should get one,” Alice told her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “A tattoo? Yeah, and how well do you think that will go down? I can see the headlines now, ‘La Princesa de España captada con un nuevo tatuaje.’” <em>The princess of Spain caught with a new tattoo.<br/>
</em></p><p>Alice tried to stifle her laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“The queen would murder me,” Rio continued.<br/>
</p><p>“What about a new piercing? You haven’t gotten one in a while,” Alice replied.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m trying to reduce the things my mother has to be mad at me for, remember, Al? I’m already pushing my luck with all the clubbing. If I get a new piercing, it’s because I’m having a psychotic break.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s phone buzzed then. She pulled it out of her jeans pocket to see a text from Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: Rules, Doja Cat 0:27<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows and went on to Spotify…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>‘Said play with my pussy, but don’t play with my emotions.’<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio gaped at her phone.<br/>
</p><p>“What is it?” Alice asked.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m getting a new piercing,” Rio announced.</p>

<p>A belly button piercing. Easy to hide, plus it looked good.<br/>
</p><p>Lucia had tried to scold her for it when Rio and Alice had finished up at the tattoo shop…it lasted all of five seconds before she gushed over how well it suited her.<br/>
</p><p>When they returned to the flat, Rio heard Agatha’s voice in the kitchen and quickly slipped into her room. Rio was just glad she could <em>finally<em> return to Spain tomorrow for reading week. She could be in her home again, in her country again, with her siblings again.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>It’d been over a month since she last saw them, the longest Rio had ever gone. Whenever Rio felt like her life was spinning out of control, she would turn to her siblings. She’d need five minutes, and her world would be put back on its axis. Sure, her siblings irritated her to no end, but it was just that which grounded her.<br/>
</p><p>She also wanted to speak to her brother about the Wanda thing. Carlos would know what to do, he always knew what to do.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled out her luggage case that was stuffed in her wardrobe and began packing. Her flight was early the next day, and she had stupidly left it to the last minute.<br/>
</p><p>Three hours later, Rio was mostly done. She would’ve been done sooner if she hadn’t kept taking breaks (scrolling on her social media). It’d been Wanda’s recent photo dump that had Rio staring at her wall for forty-five minutes.<br/>
</p><p>There had been a photo of Agatha. She was sitting on a bench in Rio’s hoodie, phone in hand, with a smirk on her face as if she’d been caught off guard. Her hair didn’t have any layers, which meant the photo hadn't been taken recently. Rio tried to ignore how relieved she felt about that.<br/>
</p><p>But what had Rio staring at her wall was the fact that Wanda could just <em>do<em> that. Upload a picture out of the many of Agatha she had in her camera roll. Rio didn’t even have one picture of Agatha. How was it fair that the ginger bitch just got to pull out her phone and stare at the prettiest girl on the planet whenever she felt like it?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio was sitting on her luggage case, trying to get it to close, when her phone rang.<br/>
</p><p>Her mother.<br/>
</p><p>Rio huffed. She’d just stopped spiralling about the girl she liked. She was in no condition to be talking to her. Rio picked up the phone regardless.<br/>
</p><p>“Hello, moth-”<br/>
</p><p>“You are not coming home,” the queen cut her off.<br/>
</p><p>Rio jerked her head back. <em>You are not coming home<em>…no…no, her ears must be deceiving her. There’s no way she heard that right.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I’m sorry-”<br/>
</p><p>“You missed one of the dates I had set up for you last Friday. I told you, if you miss <em>one<em>, you aren’t coming home for the break. You missed one Rio-Sofia.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio blinked. <em>How?<em> She’d sat through hours of torment every week just so she’d be able to return to Spain. What the hell had she been doing last Friday why she’d…<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>Oh.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha had left the flat crying last Friday. Rio had thought about nothing but Agatha last Friday. Rio had defended Agatha against her mother last Friday. Rio and Agatha had done some form of fucking last Friday.<br/>
</p><p>“I was most displeased when I realised that for you to have missed your date, your head of security would’ve had to forget too. I got rid of her.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s stomach twisted.<br/>
</p><p>Her mother was saying something, but Rio dropped her phone on the bed and bolted to her bedroom door, pulled it open…<br/>
</p><p>Lucia was gone.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio mumbled. “No, no, no.”<br/>
</p><p>She returned to her bed, picking up her phone, cutting off whatever her mother was saying.<br/>
</p><p>“It was my fault, mother. Cia – I mean, Lucia, had nothing to do with this. I was upset, and she was comforting me and we...I…just forgot.”<br/>
</p><p>There was a pause before the queen said, “So, she was comforting you instead of doing her job? She’s not your friend, Rio-Sofia. She is your employee.”<br/>
</p><p>“I…” Rio started. “So, if I were upset, you wouldn’t want my head of security to make sure I was alright?”<br/>
</p><p>The queen huffed. “You are a princess. The people who work for us are never supposed to know we get upset. It is a neutral face in public, whatever your heart desires in private. I have told you this many times.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio was genuinely at a loss for words. She opened and closed her mouth three times before her mother spoke again:<br/>
</p><p>“You didn’t hold up your end of the bargain; therefore, you are not coming home,” the queen repeated. “Maybe you’ll have better luck at Christmas.”<br/>
</p><p>Now that made tears prick Rio’s eyes. “You’d…you’d stop me coming home for Christmas?”<br/>
</p><p>This year, they were going to be spending it with her dad’s Puerto Rican side of the family. She’d get to spend the days leading up to Christmas cooking with her Abuela. It had been a good five years since Rio had gotten the opportunity to do that.<br/>
</p><p>“If you don’t follow my rules, yes. I’m not asking for much, Rio-Sofia. You listen to me, you come home. Simple.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio slumped onto her bed. “Okay, and what about Lucia? When can she come back?”<br/>
</p><p>“She can’t,” the queen said matter-of-factly.<br/>
</p><p>Rio spluttered. “What do you mean?”<br/>
</p><p>“You heard me. I think I might bring in your former head of security, Juan.”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio said firmly.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t care if arguing with her mother about this kept her in London until next year, Juan would not come back. Not after the way he handled Agatha, not after the way he made the girls feel uncomfortable.<br/>
</p><p>“No?” Her mother echoed.<br/>
</p><p>“You heard me,” Rio replied. She hadn’t spoken to her mother like this in a long time. “He’s not coming back. I won’t allow it.”<br/>
</p><p>“You won’t allow it?” The queen scoffed.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s exactly what I said. He makes the girls uncomfortable. I told you how he handled Ag- one of the girls on my hockey team. He is not coming back.”<br/>
</p><p>Radio silence.<br/>
</p><p>Rio thought her mother had hung up because of how long it stretched on until she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Very well. We shall find you <em>another<em> head of security.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Unnecessary. I have Lucia,” Rio argued because at this point, she might as well.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Had<em> Lucia,” her mother corrected. “She’s not coming back, just like you’re not coming back to Spain.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>And just like that, all the fight started to drain away. Her mother had twisted the knife in.<br/>
</p><p>“Please,” Rio whispered. “All the girls are going home tomorrow. I’ll be by myself for a week. I don’t…I <em>can’t<em> be alone for that long, mother.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She’d lose her mind. Ever since she’d kissed that girl all those months ago, Rio found it hard to be alone for too long. Her thoughts would get all jumbled up, and things she didn’t mean or believe would start screaming at her. If she were by herself, she would have no one to help tune them out.<br/>
</p><p>“You should’ve thought about that before you missed your date,” the queen replied simply.<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed as tears fell. “But it was one date. I went on all the others. We can reschedule. Just…please, <em>please<em> let me come home.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>There was another long pause before the queen finally said:<br/>
</p><p>“No, Rio-Sofia. You must learn so that you don’t repeat your mistakes. Good night.”<br/>
</p><p>Her mother hung up.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s mouth parted as she tried to process the fact that she didn’t need to reply because her mother was gone. She started blinking rapidly, her breathing doing the same as she tried and failed to suck in air.<br/>
</p><p>Tears came fast and hard and she couldn’t even cry properly because she couldn't fucking breathe. Rio gripped her covers to try and ground herself, to remind herself that she was alive, and breathing, and this was just a silly little panic attack.<br/>
</p><p>A heavy feeling started to wrap around her heart, and Rio clutched at her shirt, rubbing to soothe the feeling. She wasn’t about to faint, her heart wasn’t about to stop, she wasn’t dying.<br/>
</p><p>Her breathing only got more frantic. Her tears never stopping. The feeling around her heart getting worse.<br/>
</p><p>There was a knock on her wall.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Estás bien?” <em>Are you okay?<em> Agatha asked, panicked.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio couldn’t have replied if she wanted to.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio could only choke out a sob.<br/>
</p><p>In mere moments, Agatha was bursting through her bedroom door.<br/>
</p><p>She took in Rio in her entirety and without hesitation, dropped to the floor, kneeling in front of Rio sitting at the edge of her bed. Agatha placed her hands on her thighs and said:<br/>
</p><p>“We’re going to breathe in for three, out for three. Okay?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded once as tears continued to roll down her face.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, ready?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“In,” Agatha instructed. They held for three counts before Agatha said, “Out. <em>Good.<em> We’re gonna do that again.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>They did this seven times before Rio’s breathing started to level out.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re doing such a good job, love,” Agatha encouraged. “One last time?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“In…out. Good.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s breathing was somewhat back to normal, but the tears didn’t stop. Now that she could actually breathe, the gasps were escaping her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, shush,” Agatha soothed, getting up. She sat next to Rio and tugged her into her arms. Her hand came up to run through Rio’s hair. “Estás bien, bebe.” <em>You’re okay, baby.<br/>
</em></p><p>And that only made Rio cry harder. It was the stupid fucking pet name, the stupid fucking fact that Rio had said the exact same thing to her last week. She cried because she longed for Agatha this way.<br/>
</p><p>She couldn’t have it, have her.<br/>
</p><p>Not if Wanda could help it, not if her mother could help it…not if Agatha could.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio, baby,” Agatha said gently, lifting Rio’s head off her chest. “Remember to breathe, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>She hadn’t even noticed her breathing picking up again.<br/>
</p><p>“Just focus on me,” Agatha nodded.<br/>
</p><p>Rio knew how to do that like her heart knew how to pump blood around her body.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha leaned forward until their foreheads touched.<br/>
</p><p>In Rio’s blurry vision, she locked onto deep blue, the most beautiful blue. She had the sudden urge to touch Agatha’s hair. Her hand twitched to do so when she stopped herself.<br/>
</p><p>“No, go on,” Agatha encouraged.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, reaching out and threading her fingers through soft, dark hair. She focused on the movement, watching how Agatha’s locks ran over her fingers like water, watching how her shorter layers would always be the first to fall, watching how the other girl’s breath hitched.<br/>
</p><p>She wasn’t sure how long she did this for until Agatha spoke again:<br/>
</p><p>“How are you feeling?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled back, her hand leaving Agatha’s hair. “Better. Thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>“¿Promesa?” <em>Promise?<br/>
</em></p><p>“Sí.”<br/>
</p><p>“Do you…” Agatha trailed off. “If you want to talk,” she shrugged. “I’ll listen.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched. “You’ll listen to me? I didn’t think you were capable of that,” Rio teased.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged again. “There’s only one way to find out.”<br/>
</p><p>The fact that she hadn’t teased Rio back made her realise that she meant it.<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes held her gaze patiently.<br/>
</p><p>Rio parted her lips before Agatha jumped in:<br/>
</p><p>“I mean…you don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to.”<br/>
</p><p>A small smile spread across Rio’s lips. “No, it’s fine.” Rio huffed, “My mother isn’t letting me go back to Spain for reading week and Cia…I think she might’ve fired her.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio dropped her shoulders. It felt good to get something off her chest to Agatha. It wasn’t what she <em>actually<em> wanted to tell her, but it would do.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Letting you go back to Spain?” Agatha furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes. I missed one of the idiotic dates she’s forcing me on,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Why?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha then, lifting her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha jerked her head back a little. “Me?”<br/>
</p><p>“But before you say anything, I’m not blaming you. My fault,” Rio added.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re not going home…because of me?”<br/>
</p><p>“Again, not your fault,” Rio repeated.<br/>
</p><p>“But how did I make you miss one of your dates?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“You…never mind,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha said firmly. “Don’t <em>never mind<em> me. Tell me.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warned.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia,” Agatha replied without missing a beat. “Tell me. How did I-”<br/>
</p><p>“I was worried about you!” Rio blurted out.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“Cia had told me you left the flat crying, and then you and Jen were gone for the entire day. And I just,” Rio huffed. “Cia was making sure I was okay, and we both forgot about the date. My mother said I could return to Spain as long as I attended every date…and I didn’t.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a long moment, her eyes flicking between Rio’s before she said in a quiet voice:<br/>
</p><p>“You were worried about me?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio let out a soft, short chuckle. “I think I’ll always worry about you,” she replied, holding her gaze.<br/>
</p><p>Then Agatha’s face was scrunching. “Then why the fuck are you ignoring me?! You can’t say that shit, we can’t fuck and then you just disappear on me Rio! That’s not – hey, hey, calm down.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s breathing had ramped up again.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll shut up,” Agatha nodded. “It’s fine, you’re fine. Just breathe, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shuffled up on Rio’s bed until her back was against the headboard. “Come here,” Agatha beckoned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio joined her, resting her head on Agatha’s chest. The other girl started threading her fingers through her hair.<br/>
</p><p>“Just keep breathing for me, darlin,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio did, sucking in deep gulps of air until she fell asleep.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t bring herself to leave. Rio-Sofia had fallen asleep on her chest, and as much as Agatha knew she should return to her own room, she didn’t.<br/>
</p><p>Instead, she’d flipped off the princess’s bedroom light, shuffled them down so they were lying flat, wrapped her arms around her, and fallen asleep.<br/>
</p><p>She woke up to the sound of Jen knocking on her bedroom door.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs!” Jen yelled.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha groaned, carefully extracting herself from a sleeping Rio-Sofia to open the door.<br/>
</p><p>Jen jumped when Agatha appeared from behind the princess's bedroom door instead of her own.<br/>
</p><p>Jen furrowed her eyebrows before she smirked. “It was about damn time.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “It’s not what you think.”<br/>
</p><p>“Sureee,” her best friend replied. “Anyways, mum’s coming in twenty, are you packed?”<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was supposed to be staying at Jen’s for reading week.<br/>
</p><p>“I think I’m gonna stay here.”<br/>
</p><p>Her best friend furrowed her eyebrows again. “You are? Is it because you’re scared you’re going to see your mum? Trust me, Aggs. Mother Valarie will not let her-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha burst out laughing. “No, it’s not that.”<br/>
</p><p>“Then – oh – Rio. I hear it. Okay, have fun,” Jen replied, walking back to her room.<br/>
</p><p>“Who said this has anything to do with-”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re only lying to yourself, Aggie baby,” Jen mocked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha genuinely thought she was going to throw up. Her best friend only called her that when she had a serious point to make.<br/>
</p><p>“Wanker,” Agatha said as Jen’s door snapped shut, cutting her chuckle off.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, stepping back into Rio-Sofia’s room until her eyes fell on her standing just ahead.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re staying?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Is that okay?” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah. Yeah, that’s okay.”<br/>
</p><p>They held each other’s gaze, small smiles tugging their lips when Agatha’s eyes dropped to the princess’s stomach. She had to stop her jaw from hitting the floor.<br/>
</p><p>“When did you…when did you get that?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked confused for a moment until she looked down and laughed. “The piercing? Yesterday. Do you like?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stared at the two circular-shaped diamonds against olive skin until her eyes climbed up Rio’s body, meeting deep brown again.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s…here nor there,” Agatha replied nonchalantly.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s lips twisted into a smirk. “You’re lying. I saw the way your breath hitched. Saw how your pupils dilated. Heard you stutter.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “If you knew, why did you ask?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Wanted to hear you say it,” she paused before she added, “Will you?”<br/>
</p><p>“Will I…” Agatha prompted.<br/>
</p><p>“Tell me it looks good,” Rio replied swiftly. Her smile turned teasing when she said, “I know you want to-”<br/>
</p><p>“<em>You<em> look good, Rio-Sofia,” Agatha cut her off. “You always do.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The princess stepped back, stunned, and Agatha only found herself eager to close the distance.<br/>
</p><p>“Is that what you wanted from me?” Agatha asked, voice silky, looking up at her through her eyelashes.<br/>
</p><p>Rio parted her lips to reply when there was a knock on the door.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha almost hoped Rio would ignore it, and they could just stay like this, them. Only them.<br/>
</p><p>The knock came again, followed by a small voice:<br/>
</p><p>“¿Fia? ¿Estas despierta?” <em>Fia? You awake?<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows, walking to the door. Once she pulled it open, it revealed a little girl with blonde hair and green eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Ana!” Rio exclaimed, dropping down to hug her. “¿Qué estás haciendo aquí?” <em>What are you doing here?<br/>
</em></p><p>
<em>Ohhh, Rio’s little sister.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Ana giggled as Rio pretended to drop her on the floor.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha found herself smiling.<br/>
</p><p>“Carlos escuchó que mami no te iba a dejar volver a casa.” Ana shrugged. “Nosotras decidimos venir a ti.” <em>Carlos heard that mum wasn’t going to let you come home. We decided to come to you.<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio brushed at the hair that had fallen over Ana’s face. “No voy a preguntar.” <em>I’m not going to ask.<em> Rio laughed.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>That’s when green eyes locked onto Agatha. She found herself swaying awkwardly on the spot.<br/>
</p><p>“Tenías razón, tu novia es la más linda.” <em>You were right, your girlfriend is the prettiest.<em> Ana whispered.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>And for some reason, that made Agatha blush.<br/>
</p><p>“Ella no es mi novia.” <em>She’s not my girlfriend.<br/>
</em></p><p>A weird feeling twisted Agatha’s stomach then. What was that…disappointment?<br/>
</p><p>Ana stepped into the room. “I’m Ana. Nice to meet you, Agatha.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked. She really was Spanish royalty because she’d never heard a child articulate their words so well. Especially considering English was not her first language.<br/>
</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Ana,” Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you coming out with us today?”<br/>
</p><p>“Wait, what are we doing?” Rio cut in.<br/>
</p><p>“Wouldn’t you like to know?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked up and saw Carlos Vidal, first in line to the Spanish throne.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The royal's plan for today ended up being a trip to the Tate Modern museum with lunch afterwards. Agatha wasn’t going to go, but Carlos had insisted.<br/>
</p><p>He really was ready to take on the position as king. Agatha saw it in the way he held himself, the way he had convinced her of all people to do as he suggested, the way his siblings clutched on to his every word.<br/>
</p><p>When he spoke, you listened. It was as if there was no other option.<br/>
</p><p>They’d driven to the Tate in the royal's private car, which dropped them off by the Millennium Bridge across from the museum. Agatha noticed that Rio was a little…hesitant? To go across it.<br/>
</p><p>“She hates bridges,” Ana whispered before Carlos picked her up.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned setting eyes on the princess in her blue ‘Father Figure’ shirt and way too baggy jeans that hung low on her waist revealing a beautiful slither of stomach that showed off that fucking gorgeous bellybutton piercing.<br/>
</p><p>She shook her head to clear it of all of the…<em>dangerous<em> thoughts she was having about Rio. Agatha watched her as she tapped her foot on the bridge as if to test its sturdiness.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She bit back a laugh. “Want me to hold your hand?” Agatha teased, although she was only half joking.<br/>
</p><p>Rio produced an uneasy smile before she took her first step.<br/>
</p><p>“I mean…I can…if you want,” Agatha followed up, except this time her tone was serious.<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked at her for a beat as if weighing her options before she shook her head. “It’s fine.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded. She continued at the snail’s pace the princess had set. She fiddled with her fingers to stop herself from doing something stupid like touching Rio-Sofia.<br/>
</p><p>“What is it about bridges?” Agatha asked as Rio took another cautious step.<br/>
</p><p>Rio took her eyes off her feet to glance at her. She bit her lip before huffing. “You promise not to laugh?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nope,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shifted uncomfortably, and Agatha quickly said:<br/>
</p><p>“Yes. I promise not to laugh.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. She didn’t speak for a long moment until she blurted out:<br/>
</p><p>“When I was four, I had a dream that a troll ate me under a bridge.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked, trying to process what she said before she burst out laughing. She felt Rio’s glare as she doubled over.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck you, Harkness.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s words fell on deaf ears.<br/>
</p><p>“You…because of a…troll?” Agatha got out between laughs.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “You can go back to the flat by the way. You don’t need to be here.”<br/>
</p><p>She left Agatha to laugh until Agatha caught up with her, pulling at her arm to slow down.<br/>
</p><p>“I want to be here,” Agatha admitted.<br/>
</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“I do. Who says this wasn’t some ploy to get you across?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha watched as Rio took in how far she’d come.<br/>
</p><p>“It was my plan all along,” Agatha continued.<br/>
</p><p>The wind picked up, pushing Rio into Agatha’s arms as the bridge began to sway. Rio pulled back, her eyes wide.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” she mumbled. “No, no, no.”<br/>
</p><p>“Calm down. It always does this, we’re fine.” She slipped her hand in Rio’s, tugging.<br/>
</p><p>“London Bridge <em>always<em> wobbles?!” Rio asked in alarm.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Ah,” Agatha tutted. “This is the <em>Millennium Bridge<em>,” she nodded her head up the river. “That shitshow is the London Bridge.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio didn’t look, just kept her eyes on their interlocked hands as they walked.<br/>
</p><p>Once they were off the bridge, the princess sighed in relief, and Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Next time I’ll carry you, we would’ve been done a lot quicker.”<br/>
</p><p>The sickly look that had taken over Rio’s face for the past five minutes faded as her lips curled into a smirk.<br/>
</p><p>“Who’s being knightly now?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Only right. You are la princesa de España after all. I was only a princess for the night.”<br/>
</p><p>“Stick with me and you could become a princess permanently.”<br/>
</p><p>And then Rio’s smirk fell as if she wasn’t supposed to have said that.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha got in before the princess had a chance to take it back.<br/>
</p><p>But before Rio could reply, Ana was yelling at them to hurry up.<br/>
</p><p>Rio moved her hand as if to let go. Agatha only tightened her grip. She didn’t give Rio the time to question it before she pulled them towards her siblings.<br/>
</p><p>Ana’s eyes dropped to their hands as they approached, a playful smile twisting her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Si ella no es tu novia ¿Por qué se toman de la mano?” <em>If she’s not your girlfriend, why are you holding hands?<br/>
</em></p><p>A pink tint crept onto Rio’s cheeks as she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Ana, ella habla Español.”<em>Ana, she speaks Spanish.<br/>
</em></p><p>Ana’s eyes widened in fascination as Carlos laughed.<br/>
</p><p>For some stupid reason, Agatha felt herself blushing too.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Agatha, tú hablas español?” <em>Agatha, you speak Spanish?<br/>
</em></p><p>Green eyes were staring at her with so much excitement that Agatha doubted her ability to do so.<br/>
</p><p>“Er…sí.”<br/>
</p><p>“Cásate con ella.” <em>Marry her.<em> Ana said hastily.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Ana!” Rio scolded.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned away to calm herself down. She was sure she looked like a bloody tomato.<br/>
</p><p>“No les metas ideas en la cabeza.” <em>Don’t put ideas in their heads.<em> Carlos teased.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“¡Carlos! Ella no es mi novia.” <em>Carlos! She’s not my girlfriend.<em> Rio snapped.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha was really going to need Rio to stop saying that.<br/>
</p><p>“I am for today. ¿Cómo es eso?” <em>How’s that?<em> Agatha said.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio’s eyes looked like they were going to bulge out of their sockets.<br/>
</p><p>“¡Perfecta!” Ana exclaimed as she jumped down from Carlos’s hold. “Fia, I wanna hold your girlfriend’s hand.”<br/>
</p><p>“I…” Rio stuttered before she cleared her throat. “Well ask her then.”<br/>
</p><p>Big green eyes locked onto her, and Agatha knew what her answer would be already. She held her hand out, and Ana took it with a grin.<br/>
</p><p>They started walking, Agatha sandwiched between her girlfriend and her girlfriend’s little sister. The orange sign for the entrance of the Tate came into view…and so did the crowd beneath it. As soon as their presence was noticed, the crowd, a mix of paparazzi and the general public, bolted towards them.<br/>
</p><p>The paparazzi’s cameras were raised, and Agatha tried to ignore how much her stomach twisted as Rio-Sofia hastily pulled her hand out of hers.<br/>
</p><p>“Joder.” <em>Fuck.<em> Carlos muttered. “They found us.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The royal security team swarmed them then, ushering them back towards the bridge as others fended off the enthusiastic crowd.<br/>
</p><p>In all honesty, Agatha had forgotten that this was Rio’s reality. Sure, she knew Rio was the princess of Spain…but she’d forgotten that <em>Rio-Sofia<em> was the princess of Spain. That she’d always have to deal with paparazzi taking photos of her, she’d always have to mind what she says in public before someone recorded her and put it on the internet.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Now that Agatha was thinking about it, that must be a lot, to constantly be on your toes. The princess had to be careful before someone caught her in a compromising position and ruined her life…like what happened four months ago.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio was caught kissing that girl.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt sick because she understood. Understood why Rio said all that bullshit in her speech and denied being a lesbian. It was all about image.<br/>
</p><p>But who would have a problem with Rio’s sexuality? Agatha had been around the Vidal siblings long enough to know that it was clear they accepted Rio for who she was. So, it was something else some-<br/>
</p><p>Her mother.<br/>
</p><p>She and Rio were the same, and Agatha <em>hated<em> herself for not figuring that out sooner.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The sudden urge to cry overcame her. She’d given Rio so much shit for what she’d done, so caught up in the fact that Rio had chosen to be silent instead of helping others. It had never crossed her mind that maybe Rio didn’t want to say what she did.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>You don’t know what you’re talking about<em>, Rio had told her.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>And she really hadn’t.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked; dark brown eyes were locked on her as she stood outside the royal car. When had they gotten back there?<br/>
</p><p>“Are you okay?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha blurted out.<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows. “For…?”<br/>
</p><p>“Being a bitch,” Agatha added.<br/>
</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes suspiciously. “Are you hungry? You must be you’re being weird. Get in,” Rio nodded her head towards the car.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha bit her lip and as she walked past her, Rio whispered:<br/>
</p><p>“I actually like that you’re a bitch. It’s the reason I like you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snorted as she climbed in.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia Vidal was not being smart. She was being the complete and utter opposite. Dumb. No, worse than that. Idiotic.<br/>
</p><p>What was she doing holding Agatha’s hand, letting her spend the day with her family, cuddling her in bed, not being <em>off<em> with her? Sure, it was fine now with Wanda home for reading week. She could act however she wanted with Agatha.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>But what about in a week’s time?<br/>
</p><p>What about when the reality of her situation set in again, and she’d have to start ignoring her. That wasn’t fair. Rio couldn’t flirt, hold hands, and be Agatha’s <em>girlfriend<em> for the day and then ghost her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Oh, yeah…speaking of…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I am for today.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Internally, Rio died. Physically, she just gaped at Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>She was actually very impressed with herself. It had taken her a lot not to get on her knees and thank Agatha a thousand times over like a peasant before a god that had granted them their only wish.<br/>
</p><p>After this careful reflection on the drive to the restaurant, you think Rio would have decided to become smarter, right?<br/>
</p><p>She was not being smarter.<br/>
</p><p>Nope, she’d slipped her hand into Agatha’s as her thoughts spun on a loop about how bad of an idea this was.<br/>
</p><p>Now, at Ana’s restaurant of choice, <em>Circolo Popolare<em>, in their cornered off private table, Rio was watching Agatha deep in conversation with her brother about Aeschylus…was it? The father of tragedy, whilst Ana played with Agatha’s hair.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio’s eyes climbed up Agatha’s body, roaming over her denim mini skirt to the black V-neck top that allowed for her black lace bra to poke out, to her stack of gold earrings. To her sharp jawline and perfect nose, to how fast her red lips moved as she debated with Carlos.<br/>
</p><p>“Care to weigh in?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked. “Huh?”<br/>
</p><p>“Do you agree that almost all of Shakespeare’s plays were written with Greek Tragedy in mind? It’s what we’re debating,” Agatha continued.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…?”<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve lost her when it comes to things like this,” Carlos said. “But talk to her about plants, wildlife or F1 and she’s all ears,” he smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t forget football,” Agatha added with her own.<br/>
</p><p>“How could I? She called me in a fit last week when Spain lost to Germany.”<br/>
</p><p>Ana groaned as Rio said:<br/>
</p><p>“Because that was your fault!”<br/>
</p><p>“Whenever you go to a game, we lose!” Ana joined in.<br/>
</p><p>“And I told you,” Rio continued. “Not to go to the game even if they invite you because we need to win…and what do you do?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was laughing now.<br/>
</p><p>“You went!”<br/>
</p><p>“You went to the game!” Rio and Ana said at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>“I didn’t want Ana going by herself,” Carlos said defensively. “You weren’t there to go with her, and I didn’t think she’d have much fun going with her nanny’s.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>You weren’t there to go with her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio dropped her head. There was no malicious intent behind it, but it still hurt. Still hurt that Rio couldn’t do the things she could only do in Spain. Her siblings had flown all this way to come and visit her, and she was grateful…<br/>
</p><p>But this wasn’t home.<br/>
</p><p>A warm hand slid across her thigh and squeezed. Rio’s head snapped up to see Agatha’s hand, her thumb rubbing soothingly.<br/>
</p><p>“What about you, Agatha? Are you in to football?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Not even a little bit.”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos laughed. “How’s hockey?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha parted her lips to speak before Ana cut in:<br/>
</p><p>“Can you teach me how to play…please? Rio never stops talking about how good you are, and I want to learn from the best.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio put her hand to her heart, feigning offence. “Ow. My heart has broken into a million pieces.”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos rolled his eyes playfully as Ana shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“You play defence anyway. I wanna be an attacker.” She turned her attention back to Agatha. “So…will you teach me? Please?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio thought she might hesitate or use that witty little tongue of hers to come up with an excuse. What she didn’t expect was:<br/>
</p><p>“Of course.” As if there was no debating the answer.<br/>
</p><p>Their waiter had come, they’d ordered their food, and Agatha and her siblings were talking about something else. Rio hadn’t been paying attention because Agatha’s hand was still on her thigh.<br/>
</p><p>This didn’t feel like a game play, though; this felt like something deeper. But it still had the same effect as a game play. Still made Rio’s head spin and body tingle and pulse with want.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>For fucksake.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio was so cooked.<br/>
</p><p>“What do you two do for fun in London?” Ana asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glanced at her then, and Rio had to hold back a laugh. What <em>they<em> did for fun was not for the ears of an eight-year-old.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“We like to cook together,” Agatha offered.<br/>
</p><p>“We’ve only done that once, mi amor.” Rio couldn’t help the pet name that slipped out.<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes blinked at her, slightly taken aback, before her lips curled into a grin.<br/>
</p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha said, turning back to Ana. “But it was very fun and I’m waiting for the day I get to make something with her again.” She squeezed Rio’s thigh.<br/>
</p><p>Ana smiled. “What did you make?”<br/>
</p><p>“Paella,” Rio replied. “But next time I make it, I’m gonna have to use less seasoning.”<br/>
</p><p>Her siblings stared at her in horror.<br/>
</p><p>“And why the hell would you do that?” Carlos asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs can’t do spice,” Rio told them.<br/>
</p><p>Ana and Carlos furrowed their eyebrows as Agatha said:<br/>
</p><p>“I <em>can<em> do spice.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“What is she going to do when you bring her home? Most of Abuela’s food has a kick to it,” Carlos asked, almost panicked.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, Fia,” Ana chimed in. “And you know Abuela won’t let her get away with not eating anything.”<br/>
</p><p>“You need to start building up her tolerance,” Carlos continued as if he were working out a twenty-step plan in his head. “Little by little increase the spice in take in her food.”<br/>
</p><p>It was sweet that her siblings were worrying about this, but this was a problem Rio would never have. Agatha was her girlfriend for today.<br/>
</p><p>That was it.<br/>
</p><p>“I can handle spice!” Agatha said defensively.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head again, which made her girlfriend roll her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha huffed, removing her hand from Rio’s thigh, making her body grow cold.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to the bathroom,” Agatha announced and left.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh no, did we upset her?” Ana asked quietly.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “No, she’s fine.”<br/>
</p><p>“Go check just in case,” Carlos told her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, sliding out of the booth.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio called as she stepped into the empty bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, baby?” Came the muffled reply.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had to bite her lip to stop the moan that wanted to leave her lips. Agatha and her stupid fucking accent was going to kill Rio off.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you okay?”<br/>
</p><p>The toilet flushed, and Agatha stepped out of the cubicle. “Fine, why?” She said as she went to wash her hands.<br/>
</p><p>“I…just checking. I know we’re giving you shit about spice.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes with a smile. “It’s fine, honestly. It’s nice they’re trying to prepare me for when we go to Spain.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched. <em>When.<em> As if it were decided, as if it were finite and inevitable that they would go.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>But it wasn’t and would never happen.<br/>
</p><p>“And I want to make something with you and Ana before she leaves. You can choose, but I want to do it. I think it’ll be fun.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. “We can do whatever you want.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. She leaned in and planted a soft kiss on Rio’s lips.<br/>
</p><p>When she pulled back, all Rio could do was blink at her.<br/>
</p><p>“You really are a good girlfriend,” Agatha told her with a smirk before she left Rio in the bathroom, dazed and confused, blinking stupidly at the wall.</p>

<p>It was over too fast.<br/>
</p><p>The days spent with Agatha and her siblings dwindled to nothing. Ana and Carlos were leaving in a couple of hours…and Wanda was returning. That meant the delusional spell Rio had been under, where she and Agatha could be together, was about to break.<br/>
</p><p>Every night before they returned to their own rooms, Agatha would say:<br/>
</p><p>“I want more time.”<br/>
</p><p>And Rio would always hesitate because she knew what the answer should be, knew that she would only be hurting them both by entertaining this fantasy any longer. But the reply was always:<br/>
</p><p>“Okay.”<br/>
</p><p>That’s how girlfriend for the day turned into girlfriend for the week. That’s how her siblings only knowing Agatha through Rio turned into actually getting to know her for themselves. That’s how Rio’s feelings for Agatha turned into…turned into something she wasn’t ready to understand yet.<br/>
</p><p>“Ana! Careful, please,” Rio said as her little sister dumped what seemed like half the bag of caster sugar into the bowl.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry,” Ana said, putting her hands up in surrender. “And technically, churros are <em>supposed<em> to be sweet.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Sweet, yes,” Rio agreed. “But sweet doesn’t mean you give us heart disease.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snorted, which earned a giggle from both the Vidal sisters.<br/>
</p><p>“How do you do that?” Ana asked as Rio started scooping out the sugar from the bowl, her eyes on the scale to make sure she was taking out the right amount.<br/>
</p><p>“How do I snort?” Agatha questioned.<br/>
</p><p>Ana nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…I don’t know, it just happens.”<br/>
</p><p>“It’s when you catch her off guard,” Rio corrected.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. “I don’t think-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio sighed before she tickled her girlfriend, a snort left Agatha’s mouth instantly as she slapped at Rio to stop.<br/>
</p><p>“Puta.” <em>Bitch.<em> Agatha said when Rio let go of her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Ah! No swearing in front of the minor,” Rio scolded.<br/>
</p><p>“Fia,” Ana whined. “It’s fine! I’ve heard swear words before.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, but if you repeated them, who’s mami gonna blame? Me or you?”<br/>
</p><p>“Blame me,” Agatha chimed in. “I feel like I’m gonna make a bad first impression anyway.”<br/>
</p><p>Ana shook her head. “She’ll love you just like we do.”<br/>
</p><p>And boy, did Rio wish her sister were right.<br/>
</p><p>After the sugar, salt and vegetable oil were heated over boiling water, they moved on to adding the flour.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, wait, come here,” Rio said just before Agatha put the flour in.<br/>
</p><p>Her girlfriend came over to her.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m gonna tie your hair up.”<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t want hair in your food?” Agatha teased.<br/>
</p><p>“Not particularly,” Rio smiled as her finger threaded through Agatha’s soft locks.<br/>
</p><p>She saw her girlfriend’s shoulders drop, heard her sigh. Rio’s smile only grew.<br/>
</p><p>“Done,” she said once she was finished. “Oh,” Rio said, pulling a piece of hair that had gotten caught in Agatha’s earring with her pinkie. “Okay, now I’m done.”<br/>
</p><p>“Why thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha measured the flour, added it and stirred the mixture until it was a dough. After that, Rio helped Ana put it into a pastry bag.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, now step back, please. This is hot oil, I don’t want you burning yourself,” Rio told her sister before Agatha swooped in, taking the pastry bag off her.<br/>
</p><p>“Now step back, please. This is hot oil, I don’t want you burning yourself,” Agatha echoed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled a face. “I’m not gonna-”<br/>
</p><p>“Who cut themselves cooking last time?”<br/>
</p><p>“That was your fault!” Rio argued. “If you hadn’t been distracting me.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tutted. “Excuses, excuses.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “I’ve done this a thousand times-”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia,” Agatha warned. Rio promptly shut up and stepped back.<br/>
</p><p>Ana let out a sound that was a mix between a giggle and a scoff. “You’re not going to tell her off?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. “What do you mean?”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio doesn’t like it when people call her by her full name.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned. “You don’t?”<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…no,” Rio shrugged. “I only like it when you say it.”<br/>
</p><p>“You do?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, and Agatha’s lips curled.<br/>
</p><p>“Good to know.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip as Agatha turned her attention back to the pan.<br/>
</p><p>Just then, their front door opened and closed.<br/>
</p><p>“Anyone burn the food yet?” Carlos asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Fucking typical you come just in time to eat but not help.”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos appeared, a grin on his face. “Not my fault, Fia. My meeting overran.” He walked over to Agatha, who was dropping the churros dough into the pan. “Hey, Aggs.”<br/>
</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Why aren’t you helping?” Carlos asked Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“Because – ow!” Agatha smacked Rio’s hand away when she reached for the pastry bag. “Agatha won’t let me.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ohh, did she find out about the time you burnt yourself?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio scowled at her brother as her girlfriend spun on her.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>‘I’ve done this a thousand times’<em> and yet you failed to mention you burnt yourself?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Carlos tried to stifle his chuckle as Rio hit him around the head.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey! No messing around by the stove,” Ana scolded.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you, Ana,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>“Shut the fuck up says you,” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia!” Carlos and Agatha said at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>Rio slapped her brother again.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t call me that,” Rio said as Agatha:<br/>
</p><p>“There are minors present.”<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs!” Ana whined. “You guys can swear around me.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Ri, I gotta pee,” Ana said.<br/>
</p><p>“Go on then, my door's unlocked.”<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Ana said before she took her sister’s hand and pulled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed. “See you in a sec.”<br/>
</p><p>“Bye,” Agatha and Carlos replied.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s door clicked shut, and Agatha was left alone with Carlos. If this had been six days ago, Agatha would have found some excuse to leave. Now, she and Carlos started squeezing more churros dough into the pan.<br/>
</p><p>“Thanks for putting up with us this week,” Carlos said. “I know we can be a bit…much.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Not too much for me. I know it means a lot to her that you came. Especially because she couldn’t go back and Lucia.”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos waved his hand. “Don’t worry about Lucia. She’ll be back.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows as she turned over the churros. “What do you mean?”<br/>
</p><p>“I fixed it,” Carlos said simply.<br/>
</p><p>“Just like that?”<br/>
</p><p>“Just like that,” Carlos echoed.<br/>
</p><p>Now, Agatha hated to admit it because Carlos was, in fact, a man, but he fascinated her. He seemed so…what was the word…powerful? Throughout Agatha’s entire life, that was all she’d craved: power.<br/>
</p><p>“How do you do it?” Agatha asked quietly.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos turned his head, and deep brown eyes looked at her with the same sincerity Agatha had only ever found in his sister.<br/>
</p><p>“Something tells me you already know the answer, but you can’t convince the unconvinceable until you can convince yourself,” Carlos told her. “Then you can persuade anyone to do anything.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded as Carlos took the churros out of the pan.<br/>
</p><p>“But Rio tells me how persuasive you can be. I also saw it this week when you got the maintenance guy to fix the lift five days earlier than he planned to.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snorted.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re going to make a great lawyer, Agatha. Great person,” Carlos added.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows pinched as she stupidly felt the urge to cry. “Rio and Ana are lucky to have you.”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos smiled. “I’m lucky to have them.”<br/>
</p><p>They returned to the task at hand. Agatha made three more churros before Carlos said:<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t know what’s going on with you two, but just know Ana and I are rooting for it. Our parents probably won’t, but I hope we’re enough.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha offered a small smile. “It’s fine, my mother won’t approve either.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sorry.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Can I just ask,” Agatha said after a beat. “Why?”<br/>
</p><p>Because she genuinely didn’t understand. Up until recently Agatha had been a cunt to Rio and Rio to her. And yes, their relationship had evolved…to fucking with each other and Agatha doubted Carlos knew about that.<br/>
</p><p>“Los ojos no mienten.” <em>The eyes do not lie.<br/>
</em></p><p>And luckily Agatha didn’t have to come up with a reply because Ana and Rio walked back in.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos clapped. “¿Quién está listo para comer?” <em>Who’s ready to eat?<br/>
</em></p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Ana and Carlos had left for Spain as soon as they had finished their churros. They’d hugged and kissed Rio and Agatha goodbye, and that they hoped they’d see them soon.<br/>
</p><p>Now, after the girlfriends had cleaned the kitchen, they were in Rio’s room, sitting opposite each other on her bed. Rio, as per her new habit, was playing with Agatha’s hair. It was to calm her, to ground her to this moment as the minutes leading up to the spell being broken crept in.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you hate me?” Rio asked. She didn’t look up…<em>couldn’t.<br/>
</em></p><p>“Not at the moment, no.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio could hear the amusement in Agatha’s voice. If only anything were amusing about this conversation.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to remember you said that,” Rio said quietly.<br/>
</p><p>To remind herself that, for a split second, they had been okay.<br/>
</p><p>She’d forgotten to ask Carlos. This week had been more than anything Rio could’ve asked for, and anything outside of Agatha and her siblings had gone to the back of her mind. She’d lost her chance to save them until the next time she saw her brother, and Rio was sure Agatha would’ve lost interest in her by then.<br/>
</p><p>“Why?” Agatha laughed. “You planning on pissing me off soon?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled but didn’t reply.<br/>
</p><p>She could feel Agatha’s gaze on her, stern and unwavering.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s wrong darlin?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, her brows pinching.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, how she was going to miss this.<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing.”<br/>
</p><p>A gentle hand slid to Rio’s chin, tugging until blue eyes met brown.<br/>
</p><p>“Is it because Ana and Carlos had to leave?” Agatha asked, running her thumb over Rio’s cheek.<br/>
</p><p>If only it were just that.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s a lot of things,” Rio whispered.<br/>
</p><p>“What can I do?”<br/>
</p><p>And Rio was a goner. The tears started to well.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby? Bebé ¿Qué pasa?” <em>Baby, what’s wrong?<em> Agatha said, shuffling closer.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“It’s fine,” Rio replied, pulling away. “You should…you should go,” she forced out.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t have to-”<br/>
</p><p>“Go,” Rio cut her off because she could no longer do this. Could no longer pretend that the world wasn’t out to get them.<br/>
</p><p>The spell had been broken, and Rio had to turn back into a pumpkin.<br/>
</p><p>“But Rio-” Agatha tried to argue before she was interrupted again.<br/>
</p><p>“Leave!” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha jerked her head before she got up. “I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with you but sort it out before you speak to me again,” Agatha said, pushing past her and leaving the room.<br/>
</p><p>But that wouldn’t be a problem because Rio wouldn’t be speaking to her anytime soon.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Two. Fucking. Days.<br/>
</p><p>Rio hadn’t spoken to Agatha in two days.<br/>
</p><p>She’d been waiting (obviously) for the princess to apologise after the way things ended on the night her siblings left.<br/>
</p><p>Nothing.<br/>
</p><p>As if it were back to how things were before reading week. Lucia was back like Carlos had said, but now Agatha wished she wasn’t. She was like a wall that blocked Agatha from even catching a glimpse of the princess.<br/>
</p><p>What the fuck had happened between making churros and Rio’s siblings leaving that was making her act this way? It wasn’t fucking fair! For seven days straight they had been glued to the fucking hip, they’d been <em>together<em> in whatever way you wanted to call it and now Rio-Sofia was just fucking avoiding her?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Aggs?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked.<br/>
</p><p>“You keep doing that,” Jen said as she tugged her along by their linked arms.<br/>
</p><p>“Doing what?”<br/>
</p><p>“Getting stuck in your head. What are you thinking about?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha huffed, her breath forming before her. “I’m thinking about how I want this fireworks display to be over with so we can get wankered and go to the club.”<br/>
</p><p>“Alcoholic,” Jen teased. “You can’t even go over a week without wanting to get drunk.”<br/>
</p><p>“We’re British,” Agatha replied. “It is perfectly acceptable for me to want a drink after socialising, technically, we should start drinking now.”<br/>
</p><p>“Chill. I’m not sure we should be at the Ali Pali <em>family<em> bonfire night off our faces.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“As if parents won’t be whilst their little shits cause havoc.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes with a smile. “Just remember you get to watch things explode and a fake man being burnt alive. That should get you out of the bad mood you’ve been in for two fucking days.”<br/>
</p><p>They weaved in and out of the entirely too large crowd to find a semi-decent spot to watch the show from.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, you got back two days ago…so what does that tell you?”<br/>
</p><p>“That my best friend’s an asshole?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed as Jen drew to a stop behind Alexandra Palace in the centre of the land before it. People surrounded them from every angle, and Agatha wanted to scream at her best friend for her choice of location.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t you guys think it’s odd that you celebrate a man’s attempt to blow up parliament?” Alice said, appearing next to Jen with a plate of chips.<br/>
</p><p>Jen took one immediately. She shrugged before she popped it in her mouth, “Any excuse to get drunk and burn shit is welcomed here, babe.”<br/>
</p><p>“And this is England, Al. Nothing makes sense,” Agatha added.<br/>
</p><p>Alice hummed her agreement.<br/>
</p><p>“Where’s Rio?” Jen asked. “Shows about to start.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha perked up at that, her head craning to see if she could catch a glimpse of the princess.<br/>
</p><p>“Not sure,” Alice said. “Last time I saw her, she and Nat were getting on some ride.”<br/>
</p><p>And now Agatha was going to get violent because Rio-Sofia could hang out with fucking Natasha and not her?<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Fuck her because why was it only Agatha Rio-Sofia was avoiding? You don’t act like a couple, spend an entire week with someone’s family and get said family’s stamp of approval all to avoid the person.<br/>
</p><p>It didn’t matter.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t have to deal with this. She had a long list of women who would chew off their left toe just to fuck her. Why the hell was she wasting away getting worked up about some Spanish princess because…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Fuck her.<br/>
</p><p>The first set of fireworks going off yanked her out of her thoughts. Orange and pink littered the night sky, and everyone gasped and cheered.<br/>
</p><p>Alice giggled, pulling Jen closer.<br/>
</p><p>The sky was on fire.<br/>
</p><p>Gold, orange and red dotted it in bursts. It felt as if the sun was in the sky again. Agatha pulled her eyes away; the light blinding her and immediately regretted it because everyone in her vicinity was a happy fucking couple.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What in the fuck?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Where were all the little shits? Where were all the stressed-out parents?<br/>
</p><p>A whistling sound ripped through the air, and Agatha caught the start of a large firework shooting into the sky like a rocket. It exploded with a loud bang, blue, green and gold spraying out.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, wow. That one was beautiful,” Alice told Jen, who now had her arms wrapped around her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha ignored the bitter feeling that captured her heart at the sight.<br/>
</p><p>“They need to do more pink fireworks,” Jen replied, which made Alice laugh.<br/>
</p><p>Purple.<br/>
</p><p>That was up next. The sky was taken over by it.<br/>
</p><p>Green.<br/>
</p><p>It joined the purple in the sky.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but gape at it. One after the other, purple and green fireworks would burst, working in harmony to decorate the night sky.<br/>
</p><p>She could feel the tears welling.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>She’s green. When I see green, I think of her…<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Stop it.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>But the green and purple fireworks didn’t stop.<br/>
</p><p>On instinct, Agatha turned her head, and there she was staring up at the sky with her lip between her teeth. The light from the fireworks illuminating the tears in her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>And it was as if Rio could sense her because dark brown locked onto deep blue.<br/>
</p><p>Tears slipped down her cheeks before she swiped them away and averted her gaze.<br/>
</p><p>The tears were rolling down Agatha’s face now because <em>why?<br/>
</em></p><p>Why did that have to feel like a knife to the heart? Why did a sick feeling start climbing up Agatha’s body? Why…<br/>
</p><p>…why did she <em>want<em> Rio-Sofia?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha wanted her in every way you could want a person, and she had to stop pretending that she didn’t.<br/>
</p><p>In all honesty, it horrified her. Rio had fucked with her head and yet she still felt this burning desire to be with her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s gaze returned to the sky the same time a red firework exploded, interrupting the steady flow of green and purple.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Tell her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Because Agatha needed to.<br/>
</p><p>When she looked back at the princess’s location, she was gone. Agatha furrowed her eyebrows until she caught a glimpse of dark brown hair squeezing between people in the crowd.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t hesitate.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs?” Jen called.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha ignored her, hurrying to catch Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha called, although it got drowned out by the fireworks. “Rio, wait!”<br/>
</p><p>The princess disappeared behind a wall of teenagers, and Agatha had to physically push people to get through.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha made it out of the other side, Rio was already halfway down the path.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha yelled.<br/>
</p><p>The princess turned for a millisecond before she picked up her pace.<br/>
</p><p>And now Agatha was fucked off.<br/>
</p><p>She’d always been that little bit faster and caught up to Rio in no time, pulling on her arm to get her to stop. Rio tried to pull away, but Agatha stepped in front of her to block her path.<br/>
</p><p>“Cut the fucking shit. Talk to me,” Agatha demanded.<br/>
</p><p>Those tears were glazing Rio’s eyes again.<br/>
</p><p>“Well!” Agatha said when Rio didn’t say anything.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “How fucking dare you!” Agatha continued. “You can’t treat me like I’m you’re girlfriend one week and the next act as if I don’t exist! That’s not fair!”<br/>
</p><p>“Because that’s usually your move, right?” Rio said. “Because you’re always so fair.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re deflecting,” Agatha stated. “Explain yourself.”<br/>
</p><p>“There’s nothing to explain,” Rio whispered.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw her head back, cackling manically. “If you and I both know I’m not stupid, why are you treating me like I am? Just…” her voice softened “…talk to me.”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t want to,” Rio replied simply.<br/>
</p><p>“Bullshit! I just…” Agatha paused before she blurted out, “You want me,” her voice cracking. “I know you do,” she nodded to punctuate her point. “So, for you to be acting like this doesn’t make any sense. I’m missing something, tell me.”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t want you,” Rio told her, although her voice was as weak as tissue paper.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw her hands up. “Again, we both know I’m not stupid! Your actions, the way you speak to me, the way your <em>siblings<em> speak about us tells me the opposite. So-”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Do you want me?” Rio cut in.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha jerked her head back, the question causing the movement as if it’d slapped her. She parted her lips three times before Rio scoffed.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s what I-”<br/>
</p><p>“In every way you could want a person.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared at her, tears in her eyes once more.<br/>
</p><p>“And I <em>hate<em> feeling like this. I feel like I’ve given up control of my own emotions but I…I’m getting over myself because you have proven time and time again that you’re worth it.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>And then Rio was shaking her head, tears spilling down her face.<br/>
</p><p>“Take it back,” Rio croaked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“Take it back!” Rio urged. “You hate me, I’m the bitchy princess you can’t stand.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked before she scoffed. “Fuck you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows pinched.<br/>
</p><p>“I just let my guard down, have been for the past god knows how long, and you want me to hate you?”<br/>
</p><p>Anger had taken over Agatha’s voice again.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s good,” Rio nodded. “Be angry.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head, tilting it upwards to stop the tears from flowing. “Why aren’t you fighting for us anymore? <em>You<em> started all of this.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio shrugged, her tears still falling. “We’re not worth the fight.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha thought her heart might’ve shattered.<br/>
</p><p>“You deserve better than what I can offer you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled a face before she swiped angrily at a tear that fell. “How would you know? That’s not your decision to fucking make it’s mine!”<br/>
</p><p>Before Rio could reply, she was being swept away by a sea of people. Agatha realised the fireworks display must be over. Rio let the tide carry her out, didn’t bother looking back.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed, wiping at more tears.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay?” A soft voice said from behind.<br/>
</p><p>Deep blue met green.<br/>
</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha forced a smile.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda offered a sympathetic one. “Let’s go home, shall we?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded and let Wanda slip her hand in hers.</p>

<p>Agatha hadn’t been in Wanda’s room in a while. She guessed it looked the same with the addition of a 50s-style poster with a woman hanging out of a green car, waving as it drove away.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Green, Rio-Sofia’s favourite colour…<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Stop it.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>And she had to. That was over with.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Take it back!<em> Rio-Sofia had told her.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>Agatha should’ve never said anything. Who did she think she was having <em>genuine<em> feelings for someone? She didn’t do that, and she didn’t understand what part of her thought she did. She should’ve stuck to what she knew, fucking around, sleeping with strangers, not acknowledging that part of her that longed for something deeper.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She’d gone twenty years without feeling anything even remotely similar to what she felt for Rio-Sofia…what was a little longer? Actually, no. Eternity. Yeah, that worked because she never wanted to feel as stupid as the princess had just made her feel.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you sure you still want to go out tonight?” Wanda asked. She’d been running her fingers through Agatha’s hair. Usually that felt nice, but it was probably because it wasn’t Rio who was doing it why-<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Stop it.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“We can stay in, if you want?” Wanda suggested.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I need to get drunk.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda laughed. “Okay, we can do that.” She paused before she said, “Does the reason you’re upset have something to do with Rio-Sofia?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glanced at her. “Don’t worry about it.”<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Wanda said, still threading her fingers through Agatha’s hair. “But if you ever need to rant like you used to…like when you hated her,” she shrugged. “I’ll still listen. I’m not the biggest fan of the princess either.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows, pulling back to look at her. “And why is that?”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda shrugged. “She almost took something from me. Plus, she hurts people.”<br/>
</p><p>“What’d she take?”<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Almost<em>,” Wanda corrected, getting off the bed.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said as she watched Wanda move about the room. “What’d she <em>almost<em> take?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” Wanda echoed her words from earlier.<br/>
</p><p>“But I want to know if Rio’s done something to you. She can’t keep getting away with this shit,” Agatha huffed.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda paused her faffing, a smile on her lips. “The fact that you’re showing you care about me is better than anything talking would do.”<br/>
</p><p>“I care about you,” Agatha grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah…and that’s why I’ve barely seen you in two weeks,” Wanda laughed, returning to her task.<br/>
</p><p>“I was…busy,” Agatha defended.<br/>
</p><p>“With Rio-Sofia?” Wanda asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scowled before she said, “That won’t be a problem anymore.”<br/>
</p><p>“No?” There was no hiding the delight in her voice.<br/>
</p><p>“Nope – and what are you looking for?” Agatha asked when Wanda slammed another one of her drawers shut.<br/>
</p><p>The redhead waved a metal box in front of Agatha’s face. “You wanna get high?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio had thrown up twice now.<br/>
</p><p>Once in a bush right after her conversation with Agatha, and now in her room. On the drive back from Alexandra Palace, Rio had put on a mask that she hadn’t used in a long time, the mask of a princess. The one that was indifferent, passive even.<br/>
</p><p>Lucia had still sensed something was off anyway and asked her repeatedly if she was okay. Rio had told her she was fine.<br/>
</p><p>Just this once, she was going to take her mother’s advice, a neutral face in public, whatever her heart desired in private.<br/>
</p><p>So, in private, she was hunched over her toilet bowl with tears streaming down her face.<br/>
</p><p>The guilt Rio felt was enough to make her want to crawl into a dark hole and never come out because Agatha was right, <em>how dare<em> she do that. Rio knew she shouldn’t have entertained the ‘girlfriend for the week’ fantasy, and yet she had. She’d strung Agatha along and then done a complete 180 on her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>What gave Rio the right to mess with someone’s emotions like that? Unlike everything else that had happened between them this wasn’t a fucking game.<br/>
</p><p>It had been selfish. She was selfish.<br/>
</p><p>Her body contracted, and more vomit spewed out.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I want to go home.<em> Rio thought as she wiped at her tears.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>
<em>We’re not worth fighting for.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Her own words slamming into her brain, making her wince.<br/>
</p><p>Because at the time, it felt necessary. Wanda had given her an out, a chance to end things because <em>Rio<em> was right.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha deserved far more than what she could offer her. Say Wanda wasn’t a problem; her mother still was.<br/>
</p><p>Rio would always be Princess Rio-Sofia, second in line to the Spanish throne. She’d always be in the closet, she’d always have a date with a man at the end of the week, she’d always have to hide who she truly was.<br/>
</p><p>Like Rio said, Agatha was so unapologetically herself. Rio would never want her to have to hide any part of herself.<br/>
</p><p>And yeah, maybe Agatha was right, it wasn’t her decision to make. But Rio felt like she already knew what she’d say because why would Agatha ever settle for hiding?<br/>
</p><p>She felt her body had calmed down now. Rio picked herself up off the floor and made her way to her bed. She kicked off her shoes, wiping at more tears and flopped backwards.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Her pocket started vibrating, and Rio blinked awake. She rubbed at the sleet in her eyes before she got out a croaky:<br/>
</p><p>“Hello?”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio, what’s wrong?”<br/>
</p><p>It took her a second to register her brother’s voice.<br/>
</p><p>“What…erm…nothing.”<br/>
</p><p>“Please don’t lie to me. Lucia told me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip. “I…I’m just feeling really homesick today.”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos sighed. “I’m so sorry, Fia. Maybe spend time with Agatha? That always cheers you up.”<br/>
</p><p>And her brother just had to fucking say that didn’t he.<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t stop the choking sound that left her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio?” Carlos asked, his tone urgent. “What is it?”<br/>
</p><p>“N…nothing,” Rio got out between sobs.<br/>
</p><p>There was a pause, and Rio knew this game. Her brother wasn’t going to say anything else until she said something other than ‘nothing.’<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t think this is a conversation we can have over the phone,” Rio offered. “I was supposed to ask you about it when you were here, but I forgot.”<br/>
</p><p>“Why don’t you think we can speak over the phone?”<br/>
</p><p>“Because she might hear.”<br/>
</p><p>“Someone has something on you, what is it?” Carlos asked immediately.<br/>
</p><p>Rio let out a short, wet chuckle because her brother <em>always<em> knew.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“What is it, Rio-Sofia?”<br/>
</p><p>And Rio knew her brother was ready to do whatever was necessary because he’d used her full name unironically.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Tell him.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Because Rio needed to.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…this girl she…she’s blackmailing me.”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos inhaled sharply, trying and failing to conceal his anger. “What does she have on you and why?”<br/>
</p><p>“Pictures of me kissing Natasha, and because…” Rio trailed off.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio,” Carlos urged softly.<br/>
</p><p>“Because…I mean…I think it’s because she thinks I’m getting in the way of her and Agatha,” Rio got out.<br/>
</p><p>“Because you’re getting in the way? So is Agatha leading you both on?”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio jumped in. “I mean, I know where I stand with her, I knew what I was getting myself into and went willingly. I don’t know what’s going on with them.”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos paused before he said:<br/>
</p><p>“Right. Well, I need a name, Rio. This ends now.”<br/>
</p><p>“But…but what if she releases the photos before you can do anything? Carlos, you know where Mami will send me if she finds out, and you wouldn’t be able to talk me out of it,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Fine. I’ll see you in a few hours.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m coming to England. I told you, this ends now,” Carlos continued.<br/>
</p><p>“I- but it’s midnight for you,” Rio pointed out.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t care, Rio.” She heard her brother mumbling something to someone until he said, “I’m assuming Agatha doesn’t know.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. “No.”<br/>
</p><p>“Tell her. See you soon,” Carlos said, hanging up before Rio could protest his coming.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Tell her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Because Rio needed to.<br/>
</p><p>She left her room and knocked on Agatha’s door.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha?”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t think she’s in, Rio,” Lucia told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio muttered.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>High and drunk, that’s what Agatha was.<br/>
</p><p>After she and Wanda had smoked, they’d gotten ready high out of their minds. Agatha didn’t know if it was the weed or what, but she looked <em>good<em>, more so than usual. Wanda had blown out her hair so that her layers sat in curls, her lace black bra was poking out her skin tight black top, she had her favourite black mini skirt on and a truck load of gold jewellery.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>During pres, Agatha shot one too many <em>Bacardi’s<em> with Jen, so now at the club, Agatha could barely walk straight, let alone think.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>This definitely wasn’t what you call ‘healthy,’ but Agatha was going through something. The rules of health didn’t apply to her.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay?” Jen asked as she typed away on her phone.<br/>
</p><p>“Peachy,” Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Whenever you want to go home, let me know, okay?” Jen told her, putting her phone away.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm. That won’t be happening anytime soon, I hope you know,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Alright, you need any water?”<br/>
</p><p>“No, Jen, I need to dance with my best friend,” Agatha said, grabbing her and pulling her onto the dance floor.<br/>
</p><p>They spent god knows how long dancing. Alice and Natasha joined them after they returned from getting more shots, which Agatha wasn’t allowed because Jen had cut her off.<br/>
</p><p>The room was spinning, and Agatha was sure she was falling over until hands grabbed her.<br/>
</p><p>“You wanna sit down?” Wanda laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head with a lazy smile. “Dance with me?”<br/>
</p><p>“Always.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Latch by Disclosure, Sam Smith<em> began to play as Wanda spun her.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“Woah,” Agatha said, gripping onto the redhead when Wanda pulled her back. “Maybe don’t do that.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, shit you’re right.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed, her head falling to the crook of Wanda’s neck. When she lifted it again, strobe lights were flashing, white and…green.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>A light-headed feeling overcame her then, and everything began to blur. Faces were no longer faces; bodies were no longer bodies. She blinked, maybe Wanda was saying something.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Green, like her favourite colour.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>It was all Agatha could see.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Now I’ve got you in my space, I won’t let go of you,<em>” the song said repeatedly.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>But Agatha had let go.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>What did you give me to make my heart bleed out of my chest?<em>” The song continued.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Because what had Rio-Sofia given her? Those feelings she was trying so hard to forget about were starting to make an appearance, even under the thick layer of alcohol and marijuana.<br/>
</p><p>The club started to spin again, and green was everywhere…and then so was Rio.<br/>
</p><p>With half-lidded eyes, Agatha reached out to touch her.<br/>
</p><p>Something was different. Her hair was too long.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha lifted a piece, and it turned ginger before it returned to perfect dark brown.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha?”<br/>
</p><p>Her voice sounded different. It’d lost its Spanish twang.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked again.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda. Not Rio.<br/>
</p><p>Why wasn’t Wanda Rio? Why was she even here without Rio?<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t look so good,” Wanda said, panic in her voice…maybe? Agatha couldn’t tell. “We should sit down.”<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs?”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Spanish twang.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“¿Qué pasa?” <em>What’s wrong?<br/>
</em></p><p>Deep brown locked onto her, and Agatha knew she was going to cry. She was about to break down in Rio’s arms when she was gone again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows; maybe she did need to sit down.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Wanda yanked her into the same corridor Agatha had gotten punched in all those weeks ago.<br/>
</p><p>“You can’t leave her by herself like that,” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“What did I fucking tell you? I told you not to talk to her!”<br/>
</p><p>“Wanda!” Rio yelled as the ginger blocked her path. “One of us has to go and get her; she shouldn’t be alone!” Rio scoffed when Wanda stopped her again. “You know, for someone who supposedly likes her, you don’t care much about her safety.”<br/>
</p><p>“I <em>love<em> her,” Wanda corrected. “And I do that’s why I prioritised getting you away from her. You’ll cause her more damage than any drug would do.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The words hit Rio like a slap to the face because Wanda was unfortunately right.<br/>
</p><p>Maybe there was no point in telling Agatha. Maybe she should let Carlos sort this out and let whatever happens, happen.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>You owe it to her. Don’t make the decision for her again.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Right.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Just go make sure she’s okay at least-”<br/>
</p><p>“Do you want me to upload those photos of you and Natasha? Because it seems like you do. Do you not have any shame, Rio-Sofia? I was standing right next to her, and yet you spoke to her anyway.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio glared at her, “Like I said, she looked like she was going to throw up in the middle of the dance floor. If the result was that you ended up uploading those photos of me and Nat kissing,” Rio shrugged. “I’d happily go to conversion therapy if it meant she was okay.”<br/>
</p><p>“You have some fucking nerve-”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda got cut off when a pale hand slapped her across the face.<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked before she registered what was happening.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha went for her again, and Rio grabbed her hand before she could do so.<br/>
</p><p>“You did what you fucking bitch?!” Agatha seethed as Rio held her back.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda cradled her face, a red hand mark blossoming on her cheek, tears welling.<br/>
</p><p>“What the actual fuck are you crying about?” Agatha snapped as she continued to fight Rio, who was still stopping her from going for Wanda again.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs…let me explain,” Wanda tried to reason.<br/>
</p><p>“Explain what? That you’ve been blackmailing my girl?!” Agatha shrieked.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>My girl.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio could’ve cried.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio, let go of me! Let me fucking at her!” Agatha yelled.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll let go once you’ve calmed down,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“And that won’t be anytime soon because how dare you!” Agatha screamed. “What do you think would’ve happened to her if you outed her? Do you know how much danger you could’ve put her in?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio turned to hide her smile. Agatha was so attractive like this.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda looked at her, tears streaming down her face, lip between her teeth. “I wasn’t actually going to do it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows. “You weren’t?”<br/>
</p><p>“Does it fucking matter?” Agatha said at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>“I was trying to protect you!” Wanda argued. “She’s not good for you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped before she surged forward; Rio just about stopped her from hitting Wanda again.<br/>
</p><p>“Who even are you?” Agatha said as she tried to scramble out of Rio’s grip. “We <em>fuck<em>! That’s fucking it! You have no say in who I fuck, who I date, who I talk to. Do you not have any self-respect? I’ve barley spoken to you in weeks and the only time I have is when I want a fuck because I haven’t been able to fuck Rio.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio had to stifle her laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“W…what?” Wanda stuttered.<br/>
</p><p>“You heard me you fucking cow! If you thought for one second that I’m picking you over Rio, you are sorely mistaken.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda’s eyebrows pinched.<br/>
</p><p>“Give me your phone,” Agatha demanded.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs,” Rio warned.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t think you’re off the hook, why the fuck wouldn’t you tell me about this? You know I would’ve beat the shit out of her, right?”<br/>
</p><p>“I-” Rio started before Agatha cut her off.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll deal with you later. Phone,” Agatha snapped again.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda handed it over without question.<br/>
</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha went through Wanda’s camera roll, deleting every photo she had of her and Natasha and then every photo she had with or of Agatha. Once they were wiped from Wanda’s recently deleted, Agatha shoved the phone back into Wanda’s hand.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re lucky I’m not breaking it.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda nodded, tears streaming down her face. “I’m…I’m sorry.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “And you still don’t fucking get it. It isn’t me you need to be apologising to.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda’s gaze shifted to Rio behind her.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sorry, Rio.”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia,” Agatha corrected.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s Princess Rio-Sofia, second in line to the Spanish throne to you. Address her correctly,” Agatha snapped. “And bow too, she deserves to look down on you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Mi amor-”<br/>
</p><p>“You still don’t speak,” Agatha cut her off.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t speak to us, don’t even look at us,” Agatha continued. “Get out of my sight and I swear to god Wanda if you pull shit like this again you will regret the day you ever met me, are we clear?”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda nodded far too many times before she bowed and left.<br/>
</p><p>Rio let go of Agatha, and she pulled down her skirt…yes, because she’d done all of that in a miniskirt.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re going home and you’re explaining everything,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, my love,” came the reply.</p>

<p>It turned out Rio couldn’t explain just yet. Carlos had asked if she could meet him at the airport. Agatha hadn’t even asked if she could come, just climbed into Rio’s car before it left.<br/>
</p><p>Rio offered Agatha water and the bag of chips and ketchup she’d asked Lucia to get for her because Agatha was still drunk…and high.<br/>
</p><p>“I should’ve done more,” Agatha said around her mouthful. “I should’ve bitten you, so you’d let go and then just gone for her.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I don’t think biting me would’ve gotten me to release you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Why?” Agatha lifted her eyebrows. “You’re into that stuff, aren’t you?”<br/>
</p><p>“I…”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha giggled before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Noted. Anyways, I should’ve thrown her into a wall…or, or…ripped her hair out! Yes! Her armpit hair too because that would’ve hurt like a bitch, right, baby?” Agatha rambled.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sure it would’ve, yes.”<br/>
</p><p>“Your fault,” Agatha huffed as she slumped in her car seat. “You should’ve let me!”<br/>
</p><p>“If you did too much damage, you could’ve gone to jail,” Rio tried to reason.<br/>
</p><p>“And?!” Agatha argued. “I’d happily go to prison for beating the shit out of her. You’ve got money, you can bail me out.”<br/>
</p><p>“That’s not the point-”<br/>
</p><p>“And she wouldn’t dare press charges after the shit she pulled,” Agatha interrupted. “Why weren’t you more mad?” She groaned, “I’m telling you; <em>you should’ve let me!”<br/>
</em></p><p>“You’re drunk and you just told me you smoked half a zoot…I wouldn’t want you to wake up in the morning and have regrets,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>“The only <em>regret<em> I have is not being fast enough to get another hit in before you grabbed me.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio threw her head back and laughed. Agatha’s joined it before they settled into a comfortable silence.<br/>
</p><p>“We’ll talk about all of this, I promise,” Rio said after a while.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s cute you think you have a choice,” Agatha replied. “I’m still mad at you, but I’m being mature and waiting until I’ve sobered up so I can remember yelling at you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “Can’t wait.”<br/>
</p><p>They pulled up to Biggin Hill Private Airport, and in seconds the door was opening, and Carlos was climbing into the row of seats opposite them.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh,” Carlos said in surprise. “Hi, Aggs.”<br/>
</p><p>The car began to drive again.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha replied as she munched on her chips.<br/>
</p><p>“You told her then?”<br/>
</p><p>“She overheard,” Rio told him.<br/>
</p><p>“And then I tried to beat her up, but Rio wouldn’t let me,” Agatha grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos narrowed his eyes before he said:<br/>
</p><p>“…You didn’t get <em>one<em> hit in?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Oh, no, I did,” Agatha replied with a grin.<br/>
</p><p>“Atta girl,” Carlos said as he high-fived her.<br/>
</p><p>“Carlos?” Rio warned.<br/>
</p><p>“What, Fia? You shouldn’t have stopped her.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw her hands up. “That’s what I said!”<br/>
</p><p>“She could’ve gotten into a lot of trouble,” Rio continued.<br/>
</p><p>He pulled a face. “We’re royalty…we can get away with anything we want. As long as Agatha has us, which she does, who’s going to punish her?”<br/>
</p><p>“<em>See!<em>” Agatha exclaimed. “What’d I tell you!”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You know you shouldn’t be condoning violence as the <em>future king<em> of Spain, right?” Rio said.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I’m an older brother before I’m king of anything. You know that, Rio,” Carlos replied.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Carlos clapped. “Did you get her to delete the photos?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s hand shot into the air. “I deleted them!”<br/>
</p><p>“Of course you did,” Carlos chuckled, shaking his head playfully. “And do we know if she has any backups?”<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha frowned.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s fine, we’ll sort it. I was talking to the lawyers, and there are three ways we can go about this,” Carlos continued.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha leaned forward eagerly. “What are they?”<br/>
</p><p>“Calm down,” Rio said, placing a hand on her thigh.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s body twitched at the contact before she sank back into leather.<br/>
</p><p>“We can get her kicked out of KCL; we can press chargers-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shot up again. “Press charges!”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos laughed as Rio:<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs,” and squeezed her thigh. “Let’s get her kicked out.”<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t want to hear the third option?”<br/>
</p><p>“Is it murder, or hitting her with a car? I’ll drive!” Agatha said, practically vibrating.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos lifted his eyebrows, thoroughly amused.<br/>
</p><p>“Ignore her, she’s drunk,” Rio laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“And high,” Agatha added. “Not that it matters because I’d be saying all of this sober. Wanda’s a bitch!”<br/>
</p><p>“Huh,” Carlos said, leaning backwards. “So that’s her name.”<br/>
</p><p>“Or can I stab her? You said I can get away with anything, right?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Remind me we need to get high together,” Carlos smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Please!<em>” Agatha exclaimed.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“So you want us to get Wanda kicked out?” Carlos reaffirmed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. “I mean…what do you think?”<br/>
</p><p>“Doesn’t matter what I think,” Carlos shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“Why-”<br/>
</p><p>“Because he agrees with me,” Agatha cut in with a grin.<br/>
</p><p>“You do?”<br/>
</p><p>“Of course,” Carlos replied matter-of-factly. “What’s her face was blackmailing my baby sister. That’s not something I take lightly.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m hardly a baby,” Rio replied, folding her arms.<br/>
</p><p>“Who’s sulking right now?” Carlos teased.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha poked her in the cheek, and Rio slapped her hand away.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, she’s definitely sulking now,” Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“I regret the day I introduced you to each other,” Rio snapped. “I hate you both.”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia!” Carlos said with mock sympathy as Agatha:<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia, baby! It’s a bit of fun.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio leaned forward and smacked her brother on the arm. “Don’t call me that!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha and Carlos burst out laughing.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t remember much after they’d picked up Carlos earlier that morning. All she knew was that Wanda was getting kicked out of university and she’d somehow ended up back in her bed.<br/>
</p><p>She rubbed her eyes before searching for her phone. She located it on her bedside table and reached over to pick it up and turn it on.<br/>
</p><p>3 PM.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha groaned.<br/>
</p><p>Was she fucking serious? She promised herself she was going to cut that out.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled out of bed and headed for the shower.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>6 PM.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha knocked on Rio’s door.<br/>
</p><p>“Come in,” came the reply.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pushed the door open and breezed inside as if she owned the place.<br/>
</p><p>“Talk,” Agatha said, dropping down on Rio’s bed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared at her from where she was standing by her desk before she asked, “How are you feeling though? Before we start.”<br/>
</p><p>“Peachy. Talk. Why didn’t you tell me Wanda was blackmailing you?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia huffed, running her hand through her hair before she sat down on her desk chair, legs spread, right hand draped over her crotch where her multiple silver rings decorated each of her long, slender fingers.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha fought the urge to swallow. Rio couldn’t fucking sit like that when they were about to have a serious conversation.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pushed her hips forward before she said, “I didn’t tell you because I was scared, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>“Of…” Agatha prompted.<br/>
</p><p>“Of being exposed…of being outed,” Rio said quietly. “My mother would’ve sent me to hell, and I couldn’t call her bluff. It was too risky.”<br/>
</p><p>“But my thing is, why wouldn’t you just tell me?” Agatha asked. “Did you not trust me?”<br/>
</p><p>“It…I didn’t know how things were between us. I didn’t want to say anything, and you not believe me.”<br/>
</p><p>Now that fucking hurt.<br/>
</p><p>“Why do you think I wouldn’t believe you?” And her voice just had to crack.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shrugged, averting her gaze. “You liked Wanda. She was your friend, I never was.”<br/>
</p><p>“You were more,” Agatha corrected.<br/>
</p><p>Dark brown locked with deep blue.<br/>
</p><p>“But you hated me for a long time,” Rio reminded her.<br/>
</p><p>“And I shouldn’t have,” Agatha said. “I hated you because I was projecting,” she admitted. "I didn’t understand why if you’d been caught kissing a girl…then why wouldn’t you own up to it. Because if I had been allowed to come clean about my sexuality, I would’ve.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, urging her to go on.<br/>
</p><p>“But then you hid. Told the whole world it was your biggest regret.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip, tears welling.<br/>
</p><p>“And I didn’t understand,” Agatha continued. “Why you wouldn’t choose to be a role model for the people who saw themselves in you…who would’ve needed you. I realised the other day that you wouldn’t have done it willingly.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio wiped at a tear that fell.<br/>
</p><p>“So, I’m sorry. I was just mad because I could’ve done with someone like you,” she shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sorry I couldn’t have been what you needed me to be,” Rio whispered.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “It was wrong of me to put that type of pressure on someone who didn’t owe anything to anyone.”<br/>
</p><p>“But this is what I mean,” Rio said. “I don’t think I can be what you need me to be.”<br/>
</p><p>And now Rio was ripping her heart out again.<br/>
</p><p>“Wanda had given me an out. I mean, I shouldn’t have taken it, but I just thought if you hated me, I wouldn’t have to say this but,” Rio sighed. “Agatha, I can never be your girlfriend in the way you deserve to have a girlfriend. I can never show you off, I can never kiss you for the whole world to see, I can never claim you publicly as mine. Which is everything I want to do and more.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows pinched.<br/>
</p><p>“And I know I shouldn’t have made the decision for you, but what I said last night, that you deserve better than what I can offer you, still stands,” Rio concluded.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was right. Agatha wanted to be shown off and claimed so that anyone who had eyes could witness. But did it fucking matter if it wasn’t Rio doing it?<br/>
</p><p>“What I said still stands,” Agatha replied. “I want you in every way you could want a person.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head, wiping at her tears. “Please don’t settle for this,” she pleaded. “You can find so much better, someone who doesn’t have to hide.”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t want <em>someone<em>, I want you!” Agatha yelled.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio was shaking her head again. “I want better for you.”<br/>
</p><p>“So you don’t want me?” Agatha argued.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared at her, tears rolling down her face. “I don’t think I’ll ever want anyone as badly as I’ve wanted you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Great,” Agatha said, getting off the bed and walking over to Rio. “Then it’s settled.”<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha-”<br/>
</p><p>“Baby, I want you and only you.” She dropped onto Rio’s lap. “Don’t fight me,” a smirk lifted her lips. “We both know you can’t.”<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t hesitate.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha dipped her head, planting a tender kiss on Rio’s lips. She felt the princess’s body tense before she sighed, sinking into it, her hands finding Agatha’s waist and tugging her closer.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha almost squealed when Rio slid her tongue into her mouth. It was slow and deliberate, and if Agatha were standing, it would’ve made her knees buckle. Rio’s hand slid to her neck, collecting some of the hair that rested there before she pulled, pressing their lips firmer together.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha moaned, her body going limp on Rio’s lap.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled away, and Agatha seriously considered slapping her.<br/>
</p><p>“Just…before we continue,” Rio said breathlessly.<br/>
</p><p>“What could you possibly have to say right now? I want to fuck you so badly I-”<br/>
</p><p>“Can I be your girlfriend?” Rio cut her off.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled a face. “You’ve been my girlfriend for a week now, what the fuck do you think?” Agatha said before she grabbed Rio’s neck and yanked her lips onto hers again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha forced her tongue in and revelled in the way that Rio whined because of it. Their tongues moved against each other sinfully, both teasing each other, edging each other.<br/>
</p><p>In one swift movement, Rio was picking Agatha up, her legs wrapping around Rio’s waist, her fingers threading through her hair as Rio moved them to the bed. Rio threw her down, and Agatha had never been more turned on in her life.<br/>
</p><p>She propped herself up on her elbows as she stared the princess down.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha spread her legs slowly as Rio’s gaze dropped to them hanging off the mattress. Rio darted her tongue out, coating her lips in saliva.<br/>
</p><p>“You want to taste me so badly, baby, huh?” Agatha said, voice dripping with seduction.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded; her eyes still fixed on Agatha’s cunt. “Without a doubt,” she paused before she added. “But I want to remove every piece of clothing off your body first.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Then what’s stopping you, pretty boy?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha watched as Rio-Sofia’s olive cheeks flushed pink; her grin only widened.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t tell me I’ve gotten you all flustered already? You were doing such a good job, princesa.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio flashed her a fake smile before she ordered:<br/>
</p><p>“Arms, lift them.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha bit her lip.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The Princess of Spain was so hot.<br/>
</p><p>“Make me,” Agatha said, her eyes blinking innocently.<br/>
</p><p>“I won’t touch you,” Rio shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “You wouldn’t fucking dare.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, I would,” Rio smiled. “Arms up or I’m not touching you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck you,” Agatha snapped before she lifted her arms.<br/>
</p><p>Rio grinned. “I think that’s the fastest you’ve ever caved. Are you that desperate to be touched?”<br/>
</p><p>“Like you won’t come the second you taste me, the second your fingers are inside me,” Agatha replied as Rio-Sofia lifted her tank top off her shoulders.<br/>
</p><p>Rio took a step back, taking in Agatha’s bare chest for the first time. She pulled her lip into her mouth, eyes fixated on the perfect tits in front of her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha quirked an eyebrow. “Scratch that, looks like you won’t even need to touch me. Why do you look like you’re going to come at the sight of my tits alone?”<br/>
</p><p>"And what if I did?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha's lips curled. “Then you’re easy.”<br/>
</p><p>“For you, yes. I told you that.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha almost let her jaw drop.<br/>
</p><p>“Sweats off, bebé. Lift your hips,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>And Rio was right; Agatha was caving. She needed Rio-Sofia like you needed basic human essentials.<br/>
</p><p>She lifted her hips, and Rio took her sweet time pulling Agatha’s sweatpants and lace underwear off. She couldn’t help the way her body twitched when her damp panties were tugged unbearably slow off her sticky cunt.<br/>
</p><p>“You better fucking touch me right now,” Agatha snapped as Rio pocketed her underwear.<br/>
</p><p>“So demanding,” Rio teased as she pushed Agatha to lie back, straddling her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt soft hands and cool metal trail up the curve of her body before they squeezed her breasts. She couldn’t stop the groan that escaped her lips, the way her back arched.<br/>
</p><p>She felt her body being lifted before Rio began kissing her chest with feather-like kisses. It made Agatha’s entire body tingle. Those feather-light kisses grew claws as Rio started sucking and biting. Agatha couldn’t help the whine that escaped her lips, couldn’t help the next one when Rio circled her nipples with her tongue before blowing a cool stream of air on them.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was <em>not<em> easy, but Rio was going to make her come right here right now.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She shifted to try and stop the wave that was about to crash over her when a warm hand with a biting chill spread her legs open. Rio’s hand rubbed soothingly against Agatha’s inner thigh making her body buzz and cunt clench around nothing.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha was fighting for her life.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled back, and Agatha looked down to admire her handiwork. Her breasts were covered in the princess’s spit and hickey’s and bite marks littered them.<br/>
</p><p>“I knew you were into biting,” Agatha taunted.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “You know me so well.”<br/>
</p><p>That hand on Agatha’s thigh slid higher.<br/>
</p><p>“How many fingers do you want?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled a face. “Why the fuck are you even asking?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio hummed. “One it is then.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, you better not-”<br/>
</p><p>She got cut off with a moan when Rio slipped a finger in.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Esto es para mí?” <em>Is this for me?<em> When Rio’s finger met zero resistance.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Spanish. Fucking Spanish rolling off her tongue and scratching an itch in Agatha’s brain that only the princess could reach.<br/>
</p><p>“Evidently,” Rio grinned as another rush of wetness leaked from Agatha’s core.<br/>
</p><p>“More,” Agatha demanded when Rio’s one finger started pumping.<br/>
</p><p>“Paciencia, bebé.” <em>Patience, baby.<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha glared at her. “You and I both know I have none, so why-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s free hand threaded through her hair the same time her finger sunk knuckles deep.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes rolled into the back of her head as cool silver pressed inside her walls. The hand in her hair yanked her head forward, and once again, Agatha thought she might come.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia’s pupils were blown wide, what was left of her brown irises sparkling with something Agatha had never seen before. Agatha thought she might pass out as those eyes trapped her in some type of trance.<br/>
</p><p>The trance snapped when Rio added another finger. On instinct, Agatha went to throw her head back again, but the hand in her hair stopped her.<br/>
</p><p>“Nuh uh,” Rio tutted as her fingers tightened on Agatha’s scalp. “Head up.”<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck – <em>hm<em> – fuck you,” Agatha groaned as she was filled with metal and the princess’s fingers.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Can you be patient? We know I’m next,” Rio teased.<br/>
</p><p>She added a third finger, and Agatha screamed. The hand in her hair gripping, tilting her head up.<br/>
</p><p>She squirmed as Rio pumped her fingers, cold metal growing warmer the longer it was inside her. Agatha felt her eyes begin to water, she’d never been fucked with rings before, and she was confused as to why because this felt so fucking good.<br/>
</p><p>Or maybe it was because it was Rio.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, no. It was definitely Rio.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pressed her thumb against Agatha’s clit and Agatha’s body twitched. The ring on Rio’s thumb was still cold stimulating her clit further as her fingers continued to pump.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wasn’t proud of the pathetic sounds that were leaving her lips. Her eyes were glassy as she stared into deep brown. It made Rio shine, her outline blurring as if she were an angel sent down from the heavens.<br/>
</p><p>Maybe she was.<br/>
</p><p>Rio dipped down to plant a single kiss on Agatha’s lips then she whispered:<br/>
</p><p>“Mine,” in Agatha's ear, before the hand in her hair pulled, tugging Agatha’s head back.<br/>
</p><p>The orgasm crashed through Agatha violently. Her mouth fell open in a silent scream, her legs shaking around the princess’s hand.<br/>
</p><p>“Buena chica.” <em>Good girl.<em> Rio cooed; her fingers still pumping.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Stupid fucking Spanish.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was gone again.<br/>
</p><p>Her back arched, and she came.<br/>
</p><p>She’d never done that before.<br/>
</p><p>Rio giggled.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, fuck you,” Agatha panted as Rio pulled her fingers out.<br/>
</p><p>“Should I just speak in Spanish next time? I’m gonna need you to do that again.”<br/>
</p><p>If Rio only spoke Spanish when they fucked Agatha would die.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you okay?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Yeah.”<br/>
</p><p>“You did so well, pretty girl,” Rio replied before she parted Agatha’s lips with her soaked fingers.<br/>
</p><p>No hesitation.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha sucked her slick off the princess’s fingers, swirling her tongue around them to get every last drop. Rio-Sofia, seemingly satisfied, went to remove her fingers when Agatha caught them with her teeth. Rio’s cheeks flushed before she grazed her teeth along her index finger, pulling the ring off.<br/>
</p><p>Metal and salt filled her mouth before she took the ring out of her mouth, eye contact unwavering as brown eyes watched saliva drip from the ring. Agatha grinned before she slid it onto her own finger.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t even wear silver, but this is mine now.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, biting down on her bottom lip so hard Agatha thought she might draw blood.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha sat up, her tone softening. “Are you ready, darlin?”<br/>
</p><p>Because her princess had never received before.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve been ready for you for weeks now,” came the quiet reply.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded with a smile. “Me too. I was just scared to admit it.”<br/>
</p><p>She pushed Rio backwards until she was standing again.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s take these off, shall we?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, and Agatha took off her sports bra. She walked the princess back some more before getting on her knees to tug her sweatpants down.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re on your knees,” Rio teased.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked up at her as she lifted Rio’s feet out of her clothes.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re a princess. I’m supposed to kneel for you…I do it willingly.”<br/>
</p><p>She could see the tears collecting in Rio’s eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Qué pasa, baby?” <em>What’s wrong, baby?<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio fell to her knees, her hands cradling Agatha’s neck before she drew her in for a kiss.<br/>
</p><p>When she pulled away, Rio said:<br/>
</p><p>“There are so many things I don’t like about my place in the world, but you…you make it seem not so bad.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s lips lifted. “And I’m about to make it better. Come on, sweetheart.”<br/>
</p><p>She pulled Rio to stand and guided her back towards the bed. Agatha was about to take off the princess’s underwear when she was stopped short. She quirked an eyebrow before a smile split her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“How long have you had those then?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows, looking down before she laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio was wearing green hipster pants with <em>‘Property of A.H’<em> sewn in purple along the edge.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Like I said, I’ve been ready for weeks.” Rio shrugged. “I’ve made multiple.”<br/>
</p><p>“And you’ve just been wearing them, knowing I wouldn’t see them?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“I knew you’d see them one day. You and I both know we would’ve end up fucking at some point,” Rio grinned.<br/>
</p><p>“This is true,” Agatha said, hopping on the bed and pushing Rio up it, making her squeal and giggle. “And I desperately need to taste you, so let’s get these off,” she said as she encouraged Rio to lift her hips.<br/>
</p><p>Rio complied, and Agatha tugged her underwear down. Agatha kissed Rio on the lips once before she started kissing her neck.<br/>
</p><p>Rio let out a quiet moan as Agatha moved down her body, pressing hot kisses to her skin, setting her body alight.<br/>
</p><p>When she got to her new belly button piercing, she circled it with soft kisses.<br/>
</p><p>“I love this,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched as Agatha kissed it before settling between her legs.<br/>
</p><p>“What do you think you might like, darlin?” Agatha asked as she kissed Rio’s inner thigh.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m…I’m not sure,” Rio admitted.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s okay,” she pressed another kiss to heated skin. “You just tell me if you want me to keep going or if I should do something different.” One more kiss.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. “I’m…I’m nervous now.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha offered a warm smile. “That’s okay. If at any point you want to stop, let me know.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded again.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Estás listo?” <em>Are you ready?<br/>
</em></p><p>“Sí.”<br/>
</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha kissed her inner thigh again before she dipped her head.<br/>
</p><p>Rio groaned the second Agatha’s tongue pressed inside her core, groaned again the more Agatha’s tongue ran through her folds.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm. Eso es bueno.” <em>That’s good.<br/>
</em></p><p>Spanish because she couldn’t possibly translate her thoughts into English right now.<br/>
</p><p>“Mas rapida.” <em>Faster.<em> Rio got out.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha complied, and Rio’s back arched.<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes looked up at her from where she was eating out her cunt and Rio could feel Agatha grin against it.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha sucked on her clit, Rio couldn’t help the way her thighs started shaking, the little whimpers that escaped her mouth, the rapid rise and fall of her chest.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Estás tratando de matarme?” <em>Are you trying to kill me?!<em> Rio panted.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha smiled against her core again.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Estás bien?” <em>Are you okay?<em> Agatha mumbled<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Sí. Do that again.”<br/>
</p><p>No warning.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha began circling Rio’s clit with the tip of her tongue before sucking.<br/>
</p><p>“Bebe,” Rio whined pathetically. “Bebe, eso se siente tan bien.” <em>Baby, that feels so good.<br/>
</em></p><p>She felt Agatha’s hands snake up the back of her thighs, grabbing at her ass and pushing Rio’s cunt further into her face.<br/>
</p><p>The other girl switched between circling and sucking her clit desperately, as if Agatha needed this as badly as she needed to breathe.<br/>
</p><p>Rio continued to whimper as sweat beaded on her forehead.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled back but only to bite Rio’s inner thigh before sucking her clit once again.<br/>
</p><p>And Rio was gone.<br/>
</p><p>Her body pulled taut, an obnoxiously loud moan leaving her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Joder, fuck, joder<em>,” Rio got out as Agatha returned to lapping up her slick to help her ride out her orgasm.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>When Rio stopped shaking and her breathing calmed down, Agatha’s full face came into view. She looked like a siren. Blue eyes sparkling, her gorgeous hair a little damp with sweat, falling around her face in its perfect layers, her lips swollen and glistening with Rio’s slick just like the rest of the lower half of her face.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you okay, darlin?"<br/>
</p><p>Stupid English accent. Did Agatha want Rio to come all over again?<br/>
</p><p>“Yes.”<br/>
</p><p>“I was alright for you?”<br/>
</p><p>The way she asked reminded Rio of when Agatha asked if her nose looked okay after she’d been punched, after she’d said her mother had told her nose ruined her appearance.<br/>
</p><p>Rio sat up, pulling Agatha into her lap.<br/>
</p><p>“You were perfect,” Rio said, nodding to emphasise her point. “I wouldn’t have let anyone else take my virginity.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. “No?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nope.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled before she dipped her head down and kissed Rio. When she slid her tongue in, Rio tasted herself and groaned, her body heating up again. She knew Agatha felt the same as her hips started bucking.<br/>
</p><p>“Again,” Agatha got out desperately as Rio threaded her fingers through her hair.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes. Now.” Rio demanded.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>They were spent.<br/>
</p><p>After god know how many rounds of Agatha trying out different ways to fuck Rio to see which one she responded to the best. And god knows how many rounds of Rio getting to be inside of Agatha until the other girl genuinely couldn’t go again, they were wrapped in each other’s arms. Rio, of course, running her hands through Agatha’s hair.<br/>
</p><p>She pressed kisses into Agatha’s damp forehead, Agatha returning the favour by dotting her cheeks, making Rio giggle.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re going to be okay now, right?” Agatha asked as she ran her thumb over Rio’s arm.<br/>
</p><p>“Carlos and the lawyers are speaking to Wanda as we speak,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s not what I meant. No more lying…from either of us, okay?” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, pressing another kiss to Agatha’s forehead. “No more lying.”</p>

<p>Rio’s eyes fluttered open. The weight pressed against her naked body confusing her at first until she looked down at her girlfriend’s sleeping form. She smiled as Agatha’s hair brushed her chin. Rio couldn’t help herself; her fingers started running through soft, dark locks.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stirred, a soft moan escaping her lips before she tilted her head up, and Rio was staring into beautiful blue.<br/>
</p><p>“Morning,” Rio whispered.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes playfully. “Good morning.”<br/>
</p><p>Again, Rio couldn’t help herself; she leaned down, kissing Agatha’s forehead because now she could. Now she could kiss and touch her girlfriend as long as Agatha allowed her too.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “No, I want your lips.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed. “I haven’t brushed my teeth yet, and neither have you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha sat up before she said, “I don’t care.”<br/>
</p><p>Her hand snaked up Rio’s neck, pulling until their lips met. Rio sighed, her entire body relaxing.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha pulled back, she rested her forehead on hers, eyes closed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio watched as her girlfriend’s closed eyes pinched.<br/>
</p><p>“What is it?” Rio asked softly.<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing.”<br/>
</p><p>“What’d we say about lying, baby?” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>When blue eyes opened, they were glazed with tears. “I’m just…happy.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s lips spread into a slow smile. “Who knew you could get so sappy?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pushed at her face. “Shut the fuck up. I’m never telling you anything again,” she said as she tried to climb off Rio.<br/>
</p><p>Rio caught her arm, pulling Agatha back on top of her, crashing their lips together.<br/>
</p><p>“No, keep it coming,” Rio said when she pulled away, peppering Agatha’s face with kisses.<br/>
</p><p>“Get…off…me,” Agatha giggled as she slapped at Rio.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s phone buzzing caught their attention. She groaned before she grabbed it off her nightstand, pressing the answer icon and holding her phone up to her ear.<br/>
</p><p>“Fia, I called you three times last night and have been for the past hour this morning. You’ve got to come meet the lawyers with me,” Carlos told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh. Erm…sorry. I’ll come now.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha groaned, and Rio shushed her.<br/>
</p><p>“Alright, see you soon,” Carlos replied before hanging up.<br/>
</p><p>“I gotta go,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>“No, you don’t,” Agatha replied. “You have nowhere to be but with me. Might I add you owe me, you said some fucked up shit.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip, nodding. “Okay…tell you what, when I’m done with the lawyers, we’re going shopping. I’ll buy you whatever you want.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, although she couldn’t quite hide her delight. “You can’t just buy me shit whenever you fuck up.”<br/>
</p><p>“Plus head,” Rio added as if she hadn’t heard.<br/>
</p><p>“What-”<br/>
</p><p>“Till my jaw locks,” Rio concluded.<br/>
</p><p>She watched as her girlfriend’s breath hitched at the mere thought.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re not complaining now, huh?” Rio teased.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“I do have to go now, though. But baby, if you see Wanda…don’t do anything.”<br/>
</p><p>“No promises,” Agatha mumbled, turning away from her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio grabbed her face, twisting it back, fingers pressing into Agatha’s cheeks.<br/>
</p><p>“I mean it. She’s not worth it, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha just stared at her, a pout on her adorably squished face.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re not going to do anything,” Rio said, moving Agatha’s jaw with her hand, her voice acting as if it were Agatha’s. “Good girl.” She released her then, getting off the bed. “Now get out,” Rio told her, planting a kiss on her cheek before throwing her clothes at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Good fucking morning to me,” Agatha grumbled as she pulled on her tank top.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio had texted Agatha to be ready for 1 PM. In the time leading up to it, she’d showered, which had taken her longer than usual because she couldn’t stop looking at her breasts. Rio had done a number on her. Purple bruises littered her pale skin, marking her.<br/>
</p><p>Claiming her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha <em>hated<em> hickey’s. She’d never let any of the multiple women she’d slept with leave any on her, only she them. She’d granted Rio full access to her body without a second thought she realised as water trickled down her skin…she didn’t want to think about what that meant.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha had also eaten, put on her outfit for today (a dark grey off-shoulder knitted jumper, black baggy jeans and wine coloured Sambas), and studied because she’d almost forgotten about the degree she was supposed to be getting.<br/>
</p><p>1 PM rolled around soon enough, and Rio told her she was outside their accommodation.<br/>
</p><p>Now, she promised Rio she wouldn’t knock the living daylights out of Wanda if she saw her, but her girlfriend had said nothing about not being a petty bitch. So as Agatha left the flat, she pulled up <em>Spotify<em> just in case…<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Wanda stepped out of her own, her face streaked with tears, moving boxes in hand. Agatha couldn’t help herself; she burst out laughing. What the fuck did she have to be crying about?<br/>
</p><p>Wanda bit her lip before she got out, “Agatha-”<br/>
</p><p>She cut herself off when Agatha put a hand up to silence her. She turned up her volume, then pressed play on <em>No Words by Dave, MoStack:<br/>
</em></p><p>“<em>I don’t wanna dead no beef. I don’t wanna sort it out.<em>”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Wanda furrowed her eyebrows. She parted her lips as if to speak, stepping towards her. Agatha made quick work of jumping away as if Wanda had some contagious disease. She brought her hand up to her ear, encouraging Wanda to listen:<br/>
</p><p>“<em>I don’t wanna hear no words.<em>” She shook her head patronisingly. “<em>I don’t wanna talk it out.<em>” She waggled her finger.<br/>
</em></em></em></em></p><p>“But Agatha-” Wanda said as she tried to approach again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha held her phone out as if it were a gun, the lyrics continuing to blast from her phone speakers:<br/>
</p><p>“<em>I don’t wanna dead no beef. I don’t wanna sort it out.<em>”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The song carried on as Agatha made her way down the corridor.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>I don’t wanna hear no words.<em>” She flipped Wanda off as she went. “<em>I don’t wanna talk it out.<em>”<br/>
</em></em></em></em></p><p>She clicked on the button for the lift, groaned when it was on the twelfth floor. Fuck it. The stairs would be quicker. Agatha leapt down them, more than ready to see her girlfriend after four hours apart.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha was whipped.<br/>
</p><p>And now she was pissed off because why the fuck had Rio-Sofia altered her entire brain chemistry? She climbed into the car with a scowl on her face.<br/>
</p><p>Rio side-eyed her. “What’s wrong with you?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, yeah? Why are you sulking then?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m not-” she cut herself off when she took in the princess in her entirety.<br/>
</p><p>Jesus fucking Christ her girlfriend was so hot.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was wearing overly baggy light washed jeans, blue and white plaid boxers that were peaking out above them, a silver star carabiner with a gold ‘A’ charm hanging off it, black tank top, a sliver necklace with a small black heart around her neck and black <em>New York Yankees<em> cap…which was on backwards.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You’re not…” Rio prompted.<br/>
</p><p>What the fuck was she going to say? Agatha cleared her throat.<br/>
</p><p>“Just…where are we going?” Agatha said instead, turning away.<br/>
</p><p>“Up to you, bebe.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fucking Spanish.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha shifted in her seat, using the action to buy her some time to avoid stuttering. “Oxford Street,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“You got it,” Rio grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes again, the same time Rio-Sofia gripped her thigh.<br/>
</p><p>Was it the princess’s mission to turn her on or something?<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shifted again.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay?” Rio said through a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was going to hit her.<br/>
</p><p>“Just,” Agatha said, holding up a hand.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed but didn’t say anything.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Twenty-five minutes later, they pulled up alongside one of the streets just off Oxford Street. Rio hadn’t stopped running her thumb along Agatha’s inner thigh and her purple lace underwear was sticking to her cunt like fucking super glue.<br/>
</p><p>“We would’ve gotten here ten times faster if we’d just gotten the tube,” Agatha commented.<br/>
</p><p>“You know I can’t get the tube,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Even if Lucia came with you?”<br/>
</p><p>Lucia shook her head from the front passenger seat. “It’s not safe. Halloween was a one-off.”<br/>
</p><p>There were so many <em>rules<em> that came with being a princess, Agatha genuinely didn’t know how hers did it.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Lucia gave Rio a pointed look before she got out the car.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows before Rio said:<br/>
</p><p>“I need to go over ground rules with you.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Great, more fucking rules.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“I would love to hold your hand and all that shit in public…but we can’t.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha knew this would probably be the case but it still fucking sucked.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay.”<br/>
</p><p>“Just because people might recognise me, put it on the internet, and then I’m being shipped off somewhere.”<br/>
</p><p>“I understand, Rio,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>“I…you can still back out of this, you know? Like I said, I never want you to have to hide-”<br/>
</p><p>“Shut the fuck up.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio promptly did so with a nod.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha went to open the car door when Rio added:<br/>
</p><p>“And Cia has to be with us, but she’s going to walk behind and wait outside the shops.”<br/>
</p><p>“Got it,” Agatha said as she pushed open the door.<br/>
</p><p>Once they were both out of the car, they made their way to their first destination, which was…<br/>
</p><p>“Where we going?”<br/>
</p><p>“Selfridges,” Agatha replied as Rio placed a hand on the small of her back, guiding her onto her other side so she wasn’t next to the road.<br/>
</p><p>Right…as if Rio-Sofia wasn’t the literal Princess of Spain and wasn’t the one who <em>actually<em> needed protecting.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha fought the smile that wanted to paint her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said as she held the door open for her, and they stepped inside the humongous store. “Where do we start?”<br/>
</p><p>“Makeup,” Agatha said without hesitation.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha went to stand after stand, tossing item after item into the basket Rio was holding.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby, this colour would look so good on you,” Agatha said as she held up a Plum <em>Mac<em> lip liner. “We’re getting it and you’re trying it.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Aggs,” Rio warned.<br/>
</p><p>Right…because she’d been too loud with the pet name.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry.”<br/>
</p><p>Once they were done with the ground floor and Rio had offloaded their bags to Lucia, they went to the third floor for shoes.<br/>
</p><p>“Get em,” Agatha said as Rio practically foamed at the mouth because of the dark green <em>Adidas Samba Japan’s<em> she was holding.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I don’t need any more shoes,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Nobody <em>needs<em> any more anything. Just do it,” came the reply.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Okay,” Rio said with a laugh. “And what would you like, mi amor?” She’d lowered her voice for the pet name, which was…fine (not fine).<br/>
</p><p>Agatha huffed before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“I’m alright for shoes.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re sure?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay.”<br/>
</p><p>Next, it was down to the basement for jewellery.<br/>
</p><p>“Can I ask, where did you get the keyring from? Were you prepared for this with that too?” Agatha teased.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “Ana gave it to Carlos to give to me to wear for you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t bother hiding this smile. “She’s cute.”<br/>
</p><p>They ended up buying a silver and gold intwined ring from <em>Missoma<em>. Gold for Agatha, silver for Rio. Intertwined just as they were now.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“How gay is it that we’ve been officially dating for less than 24 hours, and we’ve already got matching rings?” Agatha asked as they left.<br/>
</p><p>“Extremely,” Rio grinned.<br/>
</p><p>“We make me sick,” Agatha replied, which made Rio laugh.<br/>
</p><p>They headed over to John Lewis where Rio bought three packs of CK boxers from the men’s section, crossed over the road to Stradivarius where Agatha piled so many clothes into Rio’s arms she was surprised she hadn’t complained, and lastly Footlocker where Agatha had encouraged her girlfriend to buy yet another pair of shoes.<br/>
</p><p>“Where to-” Rio cut herself off when Agatha stuck her hand out in front of her when she almost walked into traffic.<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve done that twice now,” Agatha told her. “Every time you cross over the road, you never look, you are aware you can die if a car hits you, right?”<br/>
</p><p>“Can I?” Rio asked, wiggling her eyebrows. “Maybe I’m unkillable,” she gasped. “Death herself?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes playfully. “You’re waffling,” she replied as she pulled Rio across.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m…<em>what<em>?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You’re…I’ve never said that to you before?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s a shocker, means you’re chatting out your arse,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh…waffling?” Rio laughed. “Why do you Brits have the weirdest sayings?”<br/>
</p><p>“Can’t be asked,” Agatha mumbled with a chuckle.<br/>
</p><p>“Can’t be…what’s that mean?”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re fucking with me,” Agatha cackled.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s it mean?” Rio urged.<br/>
</p><p>“Means you can’t be bothered.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh.”<br/>
</p><p>“Just when I thought you were getting the hang of British slang,” Agatha teased.<br/>
</p><p>She locked eyes with Lucia, who shook her head playfully as they approached the next store. Rio was too caught up in the new phrases she’d learnt that she hadn’t noticed.<br/>
</p><p>“And when would you-” she cut herself off when she took in her surroundings.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned. “I think I need new underwear,” she started as she ventured further into the store. “I mean, I should, right? My promiscuous days are behind me, I’m only going to be fucking you,” she dropped her voice low for the last bit. “You deserve to fuck me in things no one else has.”<br/>
</p><p>She watched as Rio’s face flushed pink.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t you agree, princesa?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio swallowed, and Agatha smirked.<br/>
</p><p>Let the games fucking begin.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha walked over to the slip dresses on her right, running her hand over the deep blue one beside her.<br/>
</p><p>“Matches my eyes, don’t you think?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded dumbly.<br/>
</p><p>“Thought so too.” Agatha found her size and offloaded it to her girlfriend.<br/>
</p><p>She picked out two more, one a dark red, the other black with a lace trim.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha crossed the shop with her princess trailing behind her, still very much dumbfounded.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve ever tried a bodysuit like that,” Agatha said as she nodded to the forest green see-through lace bodysuit with cut-outs down the centre and the sides. She turned to Rio-Sofia, her expression innocent as she looked up at her. “Do you think it would suit me?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio swallowed, her mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water before she steeled herself. “Does it matter? I’ll be ripping it off you anyway.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned. “No, you’re right. I'd better get multiple.”<br/>
</p><p>She pulled four different hangers off the rack and handed them to Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“What do I need next?” Agatha asked, tapping her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“I think I should get those,” Rio said, walking over to the table of lace thongs.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Wait…<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Yes, because she’d forgotten who her girlfriend was for a second. Why had she not anticipated the pushback?<br/>
</p><p>Rio threw Agatha’s load over her shoulder before she picked up one of the deep purple thongs on the table.<br/>
</p><p>“Not sure I could sew anything on it because the lace would break, but it being in your favourite colour helps, right, bebe?”<br/>
</p><p>Yes, it fucking helped.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged, feigning nonchalance.<br/>
</p><p>Rio grinned like a shark. “I should get a couple too, right? I don’t think you’ll break any of my boxers, but <em>these<em>,” Rio dangled the underwear off her index finger she wore their matching ring on. “Well, I know how you are when you get impatient.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha flashed the princess a mocking smile before she walked off, her underwear noticeably damper.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, for fucksake.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She made a beeline for the bras and waited for Rio-Sofia to fall in line behind her.<br/>
</p><p>“We should pick something out for each other,” Agatha said as they stared up at the vast selection.<br/>
</p><p>“Perdóneme...” <em>Pardon me...<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched into a smirk. “You’re short-circuiting already? We haven’t even made it to the changing room yet.”<br/>
</p><p>“Perdóneme,” Rio repeated again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s smirk only widened. “Well, of course. How will I know if you like any of it?”<br/>
</p><p>“Trust me. I’ll like it,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m trying it just in case.”<br/>
</p><p>“I…I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Rio tried to reason.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned to face her, her smirk still firmly in place. “Why? You don’t think you can handle it?”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio replied without missing a beat.<br/>
</p><p>Her smirk was unwavering. “All the more reason to try them then.”<br/>
</p><p>The princess genuinely looked like she was watching a tsunami drawing towards her, knowing she had no means of escape.<br/>
</p><p>“We’ll meet in the changing rooms when we’ve picked, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>“I…yeah,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“!Perfecta!”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Ten minutes later, both girls had placed their hand-picked bras in the other's changing rooms. Agatha had lucked the fuck out with hers scoring one of the biggest ones she’d ever seen in her life. There were mirrors on every wall and enough space to do two back flips <em>at least<em>. It was essentially a mini dance studio.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She’d instructed the princess to wait outside as she pulled on the black slip-on.<br/>
</p><p>“You can come in now,” Agatha called.<br/>
</p><p>The curtain pulled back, and Rio slipped inside. Her jaw dropped.<br/>
</p><p>“Te daré todo lo que quieras.” <em>I will give you anything you want.<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha laughed. “You already do.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio hadn’t heard her, her hands twitching by her sides as if she were physically restraining herself from touching Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha decided she wouldn’t indulge her, instead walking to the opposite side of the room to look at herself in the mirror.<br/>
</p><p>“So you approve, baby?”<br/>
</p><p>“Is the sun in the fucking sky? Of course, I fucking approve. You don’t need to try anything else; we should go home,” Rio spluttered as she came up behind Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha moved away again, looking at herself in another mirror. “Go home? What for?”<br/>
</p><p>“So I can fuck you until you see stars what else for?” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Hm…not just yet. I need to try more things, and I need to see you in the bra I picked out.”<br/>
</p><p>“But mi amor-”<br/>
</p><p>“Out,” Agatha ordered.<br/>
</p><p>Rio did as she was told.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tried on two more slip dresses and one of the corsets. She was fairly certain Rio was going to drop dead. The princess was flushed, sweat sticking her dark hair to her face, her cap long removed.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha still hadn’t let her touch her, and every time Rio entered the room, she’d squeeze her legs together, face twisting as if the knot between her legs almost hurt.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was loving every fucking second of it.<br/>
</p><p>“Go try on the bra I picked out,” Agatha instructed.<br/>
</p><p>“Can’t I try it at home?” Rio whined. “Baby, we have <em>got<em> to get out of here.” ‘<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“What’s the rush?” Agatha patronised. “Go put it on, then come back.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio groaned before leaving.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha dug through her items until she found the bra Rio had picked.<br/>
</p><p>She shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“Of fucking course,” she muttered with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>It was a see-through (emphasis on the see-through) lilac lace bra that would definitely not be covering her nipples.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha finished fastening the clasp the same time her curtain shifted, and the princess stepped in.<br/>
</p><p>She let her jaw drop.<br/>
</p><p>She’d picked out a muted green, yellow and purple bra that was shaped like a pair of butterfly wings for her girlfriend, considering her love for nature. Agatha knew Rio-Sofia would look good, but boy, did she look <em>good.<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio’s expression mirrored hers.<br/>
</p><p>“I want to eat you,” was all Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>That snapped Agatha out of her trance as she laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Home. Now.” Rio demanded.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly, hands behind her back to push her chest out.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s the rush?”<br/>
</p><p>“You better be so fucking for real right now,” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“No, darlin…I mean, why would we go home if I can help you out here?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes bulged. “We…we can’t do that,” she stuttered.<br/>
</p><p>“Why not?” Agatha asked innocently. “I mean that’s gotta be a form of self-harm,” she continued, her gaze dropping to Rio’s crossed legs. “I bet that <em>hurts<em>, huh, baby? I wouldn’t want you to be in pain.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She pushed Rio against the mirror behind her.<br/>
</p><p>“We <em>can’t<em>,” Rio tried. “There are so many people,” Rio whispered.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>They both listened to the quiet natter of the people outside.<br/>
</p><p>“They’ll never know,” Agatha whispered in her ear, which caused the princess’s body to twitch, heated skin bumping into hers before it fell back. “You can be quiet, right?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, today you can.” Agatha began to tug down Rio’s boxers. “You’re gonna do what I say,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s pupils dilated immediately. She nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Good boy,” Agatha cooed.<br/>
</p><p>As soon as she said it, Rio’s back arched and Agatha didn’t hesitate to slide a finger in.<br/>
</p><p>No fucking resistance. She grinned like the Cheshire Cat.<br/>
</p><p>A far too loud groan left Rio’s mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“Shush,” Agatha patronised. “I need you to be quiet,” she said as she pulled her finger back, so it only just pressed inside Rio’s entrance.<br/>
</p><p>“More,” Rio demanded.<br/>
</p><p>“Hm…” Agatha started as she began teasing. “Nah.”<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha-”<br/>
</p><p>“Take what I give you,” was the swift reply.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll do it my fucking self if you-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha yanked Rio forward by her necklace, the chain digging into her girlfriend’s neck.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t be such a fucking brat. <em>Take<em> what I give you.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The whimper that left Rio’s mouth was fucking pathetic.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was surprised she didn’t come.<br/>
</p><p>The princess nodded, her teeth sinking into her bottom lip.<br/>
</p><p>“Wasn’t so hard, was it?” Agatha replied as she released her, her index finger returning to its teasing.<br/>
</p><p>She could see Rio fighting herself to snap at her, her teeth digging further into perfect lips. It only spurred Agatha on; she had no interest in letting the princess find her release yet. If she was so ready to wait the twenty-five-minute journey home, this was nothing.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tilted her head as she took her girlfriend in.<br/>
</p><p>“Tears already? But baby, I’m just getting started,” Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio said nothing, just started her down as her eyes went glassy and she twitched like live wire against the mirror.<br/>
</p><p>She continued to fiddle with her girlfriend’s cunt until she slipped her finger down to the first knuckle.<br/>
</p><p>The moan the princess let out was far too loud.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia,” Agatha warned as a shuffling sound sounded outside. “<em>Shut<em> up.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled her finger out to the tip again, and Rio slammed her head back, making a banging sound as her head collided with the mirror. She squeezed her eyes shut, black tears from her mascara streaming.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“You look so good like this, desperate for me to make you come.”<br/>
</p><p>Dark brown locked onto her, eyes red from smudged eyeliner and mascara.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, I know I do,” came the smug reply. “But I’m not whimpering yet, so I don’t think you’re doing as good a job as you-”<br/>
</p><p>She got cut off when Agatha slid her index finger all the way and curled.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Fu…ck!<em>”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Too fucking loud.<br/>
</p><p>“What’d I tell you?” Agatha snapped as she continued to pump her curled finger.<br/>
</p><p>Brown eyes narrowed as tears continued to leak from them. “Fucking gag me then.”<br/>
</p><p>But Agatha didn’t have anything to-<br/>
</p><p>She parted Rio’s lips with her free right hand and shoved her middle fingers in.<br/>
</p><p>“Choke on that,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio clamped her teeth down and Agatha saw fucking stars, her knees buckling before Rio caught her, a smile around Agatha’s fingers.<br/>
</p><p>The princess parted her lips as if to speak, but Agatha jumped in:<br/>
</p><p>“Say another word and I’m not letting you come.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s red eyes seemed to sparkle as she nodded.<br/>
</p><p>No warning. Two fingers pressed inside Rio’s cunt and her eyes rolled into the back of her head, taking Agatha’s fingers with them as her girlfriend’s head fell back.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio looked so good needy, and fighting for her life.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s teeth sank deeper into Agatha’s flesh, and she used this to tug the princess’s head forward again.<br/>
</p><p>“I wanna see the tears in your eyes, keep looking at me,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s irises went fucking black.<br/>
</p><p>She continued to pump and curl her two fingers, muffled pants escaping Rio’s lips as the people in the other changing rooms continued about their day without the knowledge that the Princess of Spain was being fucked by her girlfriend next to them.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s saliva had started to drip down Agatha’s hand, and Agatha swore to <em>god<em> that she was about to come untouched.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She’d never done that before…she’d like to keep it that way.<br/>
</p><p>She added a third finger, and Rio’s back arched, Agatha’s fingers sliding deeper with ease.<br/>
</p><p>She finally applied direct pressure to Rio’s clit. The reaction was immediate, a new rush of wetness leaking onto Agatha’s pumping fingers.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s…it’s not fucking funny anymore, Agatha,” Rio slurred around her fingers. “Let me come,” she whined.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “What the fuck did I tell you about-”<br/>
</p><p>She got cut off when Rio slid her underwear to the side and sunk three fingers in.<br/>
</p><p>The groan that escaped her lips was involuntary, and as soon as it sounded, a firm hand clamped over her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened as her girlfriend started pumping her fingers in sync with hers.<br/>
</p><p>She tried to pull back, but a strong hand gripped her waist.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled her wet fingers out of Rio’s mouth as the princess got out:<br/>
</p><p>“You’re not coming unless I do.”<br/>
</p><p>And now Agatha was the one trying to stifle her moans as metal and her princess’s fingers filled her for the umpteenth time in twelve hours.<br/>
</p><p>“You think you’re so fucking smart for this,” Agatha mumbled. “You-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s thumb pressed against her clit and the hand on her waist slid to grab her ass.<br/>
</p><p>She was on autopilot as her entire palm ran through the princess.<br/>
</p><p>Their backs arched, and Agatha quickly clamped her hand over Rio’s mouth to cut off her moan as the princess’s stifled hers.<br/>
</p><p>Her thighs trembled around Rio’s hand as Rio’s shook around hers as they came.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” Agatha slurred as the princess removed her hand, their sweaty foreheads pressing against each other.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck me,” Rio panted before the pants turned into giggles.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help herself; she giggled too.<br/>
</p><p>“That was so hot, baby,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re telling me. You okay?”<br/>
</p><p>“Never fucking better. You?”<br/>
</p><p>“Lo mismo aquí, bebé.” <em>Same here, baby.<br/>
</em></p><p>“Next time,” Rio got out. “We gotta use the mirrors.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha lifted her head. “I think that’s the best idea you’ve ever come up with.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed before planting a kiss on her lips.</p>

<p>Agatha stared at her, the ginger bitch who almost ruined her girlfriend’s life. Why the fuck she had even bothered knocking on her door was beyond her. She cursed her best friend for letting her in, even though Jen knew nothing about the situation.<br/>
</p><p>“I-” Wanda started before Agatha went to slam the door in her face.<br/>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the redheaded tart was quick and stuck her foot out before Agatha could.<br/>
</p><p>“I will crush every bone in your foot if you don’t move it,” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“So you’re talking to me now?” Wanda replied as Agatha continued to nudge Wanda’s foot out of the way.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m <em>threatening<em> you, yes!”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Just…hear me out, please?” Wanda tried to reason.<br/>
</p><p>“You are aware my girlfriend’s lawyers could put you in jail, right? You’re getting off lucky, your limbs are still attached to your body, keep pissing me off and that will change.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda scoffed.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha flashed her a smile. “You think I’m joking?”<br/>
</p><p>“She’s your girlfriend now?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled a face. “That’s what I just said, wasn't it?”<br/>
</p><p>“She’s not good for you,” came the reply.<br/>
</p><p>Was Agatha hearing right? Where the fuck did this bitch’s audacity come from?<br/>
</p><p>“Do you need me to slap you again?”<br/>
</p><p>“I didn’t come here to fight,” Wanda told her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scrunched her face further. “That’s exactly what-”<br/>
</p><p>“I still want us to be friends,” Wanda got out.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha gaped at her before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Am I a dickhead?”<br/>
</p><p>“What-”<br/>
</p><p>“Do I have dickhead written across my forehead?” Agatha continued. “Why the <em>fuck<em> would I want to be friends with you?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Because we-”<br/>
</p><p>The front door sounding cut Wanda off, and if deep brown eyes could kill.<br/>
</p><p>“Wanda. Get. Out.” Rio’s voice sliced through the air like a knife.<br/>
</p><p>Damp. Wet. Tear trickling down her thigh, no, no, a goddam waterfall. Agatha needed a fucking hair tie and to be on her knees for her princess <em>now<em>. Wanda could watch for all she cared.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha bit her lip, pupils blown wide as Rio-Sofia stormed up to them.<br/>
</p><p>“You were supposed to be gone,” Rio checked her phone. “An hour ago. Why the fuck am I still looking at you?”<br/>
</p><p>This- that- there was nothing regal or princess-like about Rio’s tone. It was pure fucking venom ready to spit out and poison.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha subtly squeezed her legs together.<br/>
</p><p>“I was just coming to say goodbye to Agatha,” Wanda said nonchalantly.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s held tilted a fraction, the movement calculated, precise…<em>sinister.<br/>
</em></p><p>“But you know damn well that she wouldn’t want to see you. Do you not understand she would’ve killed you if I hadn’t stopped her?”<br/>
</p><p>“Still can,” Agatha said without missing a beat. “Just say the word, baby.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio fought off the smirk Agatha knew wanted to paint her lips as she slid her arm around Agatha’s waist.<br/>
</p><p>Ooo…nope. Rio couldn’t do that. Agatha was already in fucking heat dying off her words alone and now her girlfriend was touching her?<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>And Rio needed to.<br/>
</p><p>“Why are we still looking at you?” Agatha snapped because Wanda was getting in the way of her fucking her girlfriend <em>again.<br/>
</em></p><p>The ginger twat nodded, finally turning to leave before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“She’ll have to hide you. All three of us know you won’t do well being hidden, Agatha,” Wanda shrugged as she continued to walk away. “Food for thought.”<br/>
</p><p>She let Wanda’s words roll off her back, but Rio…Agatha felt her body tense against hers, caught the tight press of her lips, knew the murderous glint that would be in her eyes knowing she couldn’t act on those desires. Princess of Spain and all that. But Agatha wasn’t.<br/>
</p><p>No thoughts.<br/>
</p><p>She walked out of Rio’s hold, grabbed Wanda’s phone out of her back pocket…<br/>
</p><p>The redhead spun on her. “You wouldn’t-”<br/>
</p><p>“Whoops.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda’s phone landed on the ground screen first with a splat. The shattering and splitting of glass breaking against hard wooden floor was music to Agatha’s ears. To drive the knife in further…<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t you-”<br/>
</p><p>Thank god for <em>Doc Martens.<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha stomped on Wanda’s phone, causing more damage.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re gonna let her do that?!” Wanda yelled over the noise.<br/>
</p><p>“I told her she couldn’t touch you…she’s not,” Rio said simply.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stepped back to admire her handiwork. Tiny black shards of glass littered their floor, the red backing of Wanda’s phone was shattered, and the camera lenses were destroyed.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Huh…how poetic.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Wanda picked up what was left of her phone. “You said you weren’t going to break it!”<br/>
</p><p>“And I said to never talk to us again,” Agatha replied just as fast.<br/>
</p><p>“Look who’s still talking,” Rio chimed in, arm wrapping around Agatha’s waist again.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Jesus fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t know what Rio was on today, but the way she was actually fighting Wanda back, adding to Agatha’s chaos, letting Agatha run wild? Yeah…till Agatha’s knees were bloody and bruising.<br/>
</p><p>“Te necesito ahora.” <em>I need you now<em>. Agatha got out.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio smirked. “Paciencia, bebé. La perra pelirroja todavía está aquí.” <em>Patience, baby. The redheaded bitch is still here.<br/>
</em></p><p>“You guys know I don’t understand what you’re saying, right?” Wanda said.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glanced at Wanda before returning her gaze to Rio. “¿Es ella estúpida?” <em>Is she stupid?<br/>
</em></p><p>“Yes. Wanda, get out.”<br/>
</p><p>She glared at them before finally fucking off.<br/>
</p><p>“Jesus that-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha crashing their lips together cut Rio off.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha swallowed her words. She’d take her right here in the corridor.<br/>
</p><p>“We…” Rio tried to get out until:<br/>
</p><p>“AHEM!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled away, a scowl on her face ready to point at whoever was stopping her from devouring her girlfriend.<br/>
</p><p>She was met with Jen and Alice poking their heads out of Jen’s bedroom and Natasha and Lucia standing by their front door.<br/>
</p><p>“It was about damn time,” Alice mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“What was all that noise about?” Jen asked the same time:<br/>
</p><p>“So you’re official then?” Natasha called down to them.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” Agatha replied. “And you’re all currently cock blocking me so if you don’t mind,” Agatha opened her bedroom door, pushing Rio in. “I’m going to go eat out my girlfriend now!”<br/>
</p><p>“This girl,” Jen muttered.<br/>
</p><p>“I think that’s our cue to leave the flat,” Alice said.<br/>
</p><p>“But what was all that-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha cut her off. “Much appreciated!” She replied before she pounced on her princess.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Wanda was officially gone for good. They hadn’t told the girls what exactly had gone down, but they were all smart enough to figure out it wasn’t great. Carlos had handled the situation and the lawyers with the queen none the wiser, and everything was back to normal.<br/>
</p><p>Now, it was the week before the Christmas holidays, and Agatha, along with the rest of the girls, were dying (in the middle of exam season). She couldn’t catch a break between studying, remembering to feed herself, and trying not to crash out every five minutes.<br/>
</p><p>This also meant her relationship was on the back end of things which was fine (not fucking fine at all). The degree came first, would always come first. They’d barely seen each other. Studying together was not an option. They tried once, fifteen minutes later Rio had torn all her clothes off and had her body pinned to the mattress.<br/>
</p><p>As much as Agatha would love to fuck her girlfriend every time she typed something down, it was unproductive. This meant rules. They had to stay away from each other, which was fine (Agatha was going to kill herself).<br/>
</p><p>She needed a coffee, actually, no, she needed to rip her hair out. She was sitting at her desk, gearing up to answer another practice question in timed conditions when…<br/>
</p><p>“Mi amor?” And a knock to follow.<br/>
</p><p>She would never get tired of it. Of the pet name, of the Spanish, of the way Rio specifically sounded when she spoke it. Her voice always got softer with Spanish, calmer and carefree (unless she was venting or telling Agatha off).<br/>
</p><p>“Come in,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio opened the door with a…<br/>
</p><p>“I could kiss you!”<br/>
</p><p>“Could or should?” Rio countered as she walked in with a large <em>Blank Street<em> iced coffee. “Yes, there’s caramel in it before you ask.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Oh, you definitely get a kiss now,” Agatha grinned as she pulled her girlfriend in by her t-shirt.<br/>
</p><p>They pecked before Agatha took the coffee and sipped.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s all I get?” Rio asked, offence in her tone.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m practising self-restraint.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio scrunched her face. “Why?”<br/>
</p><p>“Because I can’t have my lips on yours for more than five seconds without wanting to get you naked, alright?” Agatha huffed, which made Rio laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“Can’t keep it in your pants?” Rio teased.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glared at her. “Says fucking you!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio cackled, wiping the glare clean off her face. Rio’s laugh was her favourite laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“And how’s that going?” Rio nodded to Agatha’s laptop with the practice question on it.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s going. Fourth question today, but I don’t know. I feel like shits not sticking.” She took another sip.<br/>
</p><p>“Have you eaten at all?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha took an extremely long sip of coffee.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby?” But there was warning in Rio’s voice.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“What was that?”<br/>
</p><p>“No, I haven’t fucking eaten!” Agatha yelled.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s,” Rio checked her watch (which was fucking attractive by the way. Recently she’d started wearing one and Agatha kept wondering what it might feel like if she put it…anyway). “It’s 4 PM.”<br/>
</p><p>“Sue me,” Agatha grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“Put your shoes on,” Rio ordered.<br/>
</p><p>“What-”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m taking you to get food. Shoes on now.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha groaned. “Rio, I don’t have time, I have to-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia tilted her head ever so slightly and for some fucked up reason it made Agatha shut up.<br/>
</p><p>“Shoes.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded and did as she was told…yes, that’s right…<em>Agatha<em> did as she was told.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>Fuck me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She was whipped.<br/>
</p><p>“And bring a coat.”<br/>
</p><p>“Like hell I will, I don’t need one,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>They ended up at an <em>Itsu<em>. Agatha was craving sushi. They split chicken gyozas whilst Agatha got a sushi festival and Rio got a salmon poke.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I think you discovering sushi was the best thing that has happened to you,” Rio laughed as her girlfriend demolished her sushi platter.<br/>
</p><p>“Another reason to hate my mother, she stopped me from discovering <em>this<em>?” Agatha said around her mouthful.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio’s smile wavered a little. “Is she why you do everything with your right hand even though you’re left-handed?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s chewing slowed. “How do you know I’m left-handed?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded to the chopsticks in her left hand. “You eat as someone who’s left-handed, your passes are stronger with your left hand at practice, and when you fin-” Rio cut herself off.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smirked. “When I finger you, I use my left hand? Is that what you were going to say?” She whispered.<br/>
</p><p>Rio kicked her under the table making her laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“Is that why?” Rio prompted.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s laughter died out, and she swallowed roughly. “Erm…yeah. Left handed people are evil devil worshippers and all that shit.” She shrugged as if it were nothing before picking up another piece of sushi.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s stomach twisted, but she also felt the undeniable rise of anger bubbling just beneath her skin.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, how she hated Evanora Harkness.<br/>
</p><p>“Didn’t matter that she beat right-handedness into me anyway, she still believes I’m evil.”<br/>
</p><p>Here’s where Rio would’ve called her ‘mi amor’ or ‘baby’ but they were in fucking public.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha.” Because it was all she was allowed to say. “You are not evil.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded, eyes fixed on her food. “No, I know. But I’m…I’m weak.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio jerked her head back. “That’s the most bullshit I’ve heard in my life.<br/>
</p><p>“No…in the sense that I can’t stand up to her. I never have,” she shrugged once again. “Makes me weak.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio wanted to reach out and touch her, hold her hand, rest hers on her lap, <em>something<em>. She balled her hands into fists to stop herself.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“It doesn’t make you weak, bab- Agatha.”<br/>
</p><p>“That’s why I refuse to be weak or <em>bad<em> at anything else,” Agatha continued as if she hadn’t heard. “I must excel so I can survive without her.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The way her girlfriend said it was like it was a mantra she told herself.<br/>
</p><p>“I want…”<br/>
</p><p>“Power,” Rio finished her sentence. “You want power over your mother.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Complete financial, mental, physical. When I have that, I’ll no longer be scared of her. I won’t be weak.”<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes met brown.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. “What for?”<br/>
</p><p>“For telling me.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked as if she hadn’t realised that’s what she’d done…shared…willingly.<br/>
</p><p>She averted her gaze again. “You unfortunately make it easy.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched. “I-”<br/>
</p><p>“If you tease me, I <em>will<em> stab your eyeball out with this chopstick. I do not care if Lucia kills me afterwards.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Speaking of…can we ditch her? I want to take you on the tube.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shot her a look that said, ‘Be serious.’<br/>
</p><p>“What?”<br/>
</p><p>“We can’t ditch Cia. One, she was almost fired a few weeks ago; two, she’s here to protect me.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled a face. “You think I can’t protect you? I’ll kill anyone if they dare attack you, I’m scrappy.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed again. “Yes, because your 5’2 ass is going to protect my 5’9.”<br/>
</p><p>“5’4,” Agatha corrected. “And yes! I’m fast and scrappy. You’ve literally seen it when I went for the ginger tart.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t stop laughing.<br/>
</p><p>“And I’ll show you right now.”<br/>
</p><p>No warning.<br/>
</p><p>She grabbed Rio’s arm and dragged them out of the shop towards the tube station before Lucia could stop them. Agatha tapped her Oyster card and pushed Rio through the barricades with her as one of the station workers yelled at them to come back. They shot down the escalator and slipped into a tube carriage right before the doors squeezed shut.<br/>
</p><p>The girls were panting and red-faced with their hair sticking to damp skin. Agatha smiled, and Rio could never help the way hers immediately followed.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby, what the hell?” Rio whispered.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha giggled. “What? You need to be a Londoner for an evening.”<br/>
</p><p>“Where are we going?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t know?”<br/>
</p><p>“That’s what makes it fun. We’ll get off when we feel it in our gut,” Agatha told her with a grin.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded slowly. “Right…”<br/>
</p><p>“Just shut up and trust me.”<br/>
</p><p>And Rio did.<br/>
</p><p>She sat next to her girlfriend as the Northern Line service from High Barnet via Bank made its way to its final destination, Morden.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pressed her arm against Rio’s as they watched the doors open and shut as they drew into each station, watched people leave and join their carriage. She wanted so desperately to be able to pull Agatha’s hand into her lap and hold it.<br/>
</p><p>They’d reached London Bridge Station now, the doors just sliding open when Agatha announced:<br/>
</p><p>“We’re getting off.”<br/>
</p><p>“What?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t have time to collect her thoughts as her girlfriend dragged her out of the carriage just before the doors snapped shut.<br/>
</p><p>“You could’ve murdered me!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You were fine!” She started tugging Rio to the exit.<br/>
</p><p>“And you’re not funny by the way.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows as they got onto the escalator.<br/>
</p><p>“London Bridge station, Aggs?”<br/>
</p><p>Her girlfriend looked genuinely confused for a moment until she connected the dots. “Oh! I swear I didn’t do it on purpose, I <em>truly<em> forgot you hate bridges.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Shut the fuck up.”<br/>
</p><p>“I <em>did<em>!” Agatha laughed. “Promise. Look, I’ll hold your hand again.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I would love that-”<br/>
</p><p>“But we can’t,” Agatha huffed because she’d forgotten that too.<br/>
</p><p>Once they left the station, Agatha made them run across the bridge so Rio wouldn’t have to think about it.<br/>
</p><p>“See, no trolls and the shit show,” she nodded to the bridge.<br/>
</p><p>“Why is the actual London Bridge so disappointing compared to the others?” Rio asked as she shrugged off her <em>North Face<em> puffer.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Something about them not being able to – I don’t need it,” Agatha said when Rio put her coat around her.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re shivering. I told you to bring a coat,” Rio teased as she pulled at her hoodie sleeves and adjusted her red beanie.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes before pulling the coat on. “Something about them not being able to replicate the original after it burnt down, so they just gave up and built that poor excuse instead.”<br/>
</p><p>They began descending a flight of stairs that brought them level with the River Thames.<br/>
</p><p>The sky was dark; the street lamps lit the walkway, and there were minimal people out considering it was 8 PM on a week day during winter. It was only because of this that Rio thought it was safe to…<br/>
</p><p>Agatha gasped. “Are we holding pinkies right now, Rio-Sofia? In <em>public<em>?! You do know this is supposed to be a secret relationship, right? You’re ruining all my fun.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Yes, she could hold Agatha’s pinkie. She couldn’t commit to a full on hand hold, but she could give her girlfriend this as the bottom of the barrel bare fucking minimum.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Actually, no. You’re too close for comfort. I want my secrecy,” Agatha said before she ran.<br/>
</p><p>Fucking ran away from Rio as she bolted down the length of the River Thames.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you fucking serious?!” Rio called.<br/>
</p><p>And yes she was because Agatha didn’t stop.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes playfully before she took off after her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio chased her until she could snatch Agatha up, lifting her off the ground and spinning her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed as they spun. “I’m trying to get away from you!” She said as her laughter continued.<br/>
</p><p>Rio put her down and turned Agatha to face her. “You’re never getting away from me.”<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes were looking up at her. “Is that so?”<br/>
</p><p>She shouldn’t have, but she did it anyway. She brushed her girlfriend’s hair out of her face. “Not if I can help it.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes teasingly. “Imma hold you to that.”<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t think.<br/>
</p><p>Rio dipped her head down and kissed Agatha in the shadows of the street lamps, in the cloaking of the night sky.<br/>
</p><p>A warm feeling spread around her heart, and when Agatha pulled away, she found her hand flying up to clutch onto it. To trap the feeling beneath her clothes before it disappeared.<br/>
</p><p>“Thought we weren’t allowed to do that,” Agatha said, nudging her in the arm.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “You know what you said the other day?”<br/>
</p><p>“I say a lot of things, baby. You have to be more specific.”<br/>
</p><p>“That you were happy,” Rio elaborated.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah?”<br/>
</p><p>“Me too,” Rio nodded. “Your fault.”<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha smiled, it reached her eyes. “My bad.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed before slipping her entire hand in Agatha’s as they continued down the river.</p>

<p>A month.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had gone an entire fucking month without seeing her girlfriend. Having to go from seeing Rio every day to only texting, seeing her face on a phone screen, and the occasional TV appearance was a violent shock to the system, like being doused in ice water.<br/>
</p><p>And oh yes…the TV appearances. Christmas like in most catholic countries was a big ass fucking deal. Rio had warned her that on the two days leading up to Christmas and on January 6th, she wouldn’t be able to talk much, which was fine (Agatha was going through withdrawals).<br/>
</p><p>It was fascinating however, to see the switch. To watch her girlfriend go from Rio to Princess Rio-Sofia of Spain. She never looked like herself, not really, whenever Agatha watched her on the news or in videos on social media. Her signature eyeliner was always gone, her stack of earrings too. Her makeup was soft, and her clothes were always some pastel colour. Her facial expressions were always controlled as if they had been preplanned out, which was interesting to observe considering how expressive Agatha knew she could be.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt like she did the first time she’d seen Rio’s speech half a year ago. She still caught the blinking as if Rio was trying to suppress an eyeroll, the fidgeting if you paid close enough attention. Her girlfriend was a princess sure, but under that thick layer of perfection, Agatha could still see Rio. And she realised even before she knew her, that she always had.<br/>
</p><p>She missed her so much.<br/>
</p><p>The day Rio had left for the Christmas holidays, she’d sent a picture of her aeroplane window, ‘I miss you, baby,’ below. Agatha had told her to shut up and that they’d only been apart for two hours. She immediately took it back half an hour after she’d replied. Two hours might as well have been two centuries.<br/>
</p><p>She’d spent the holidays and the New Year with Jen and her family back home whilst avoiding her mother like the plague, which proved more difficult in their small village. She realised then that she did not miss her home town. It could burn for all she cared. Everything was too slow, too simple. London, with its chaos and its vibrancy was where Agatha thrived.<br/>
</p><p>Thank fuck she was going back today.<br/>
</p><p>She was in the car with Jen and Valarie ten minutes away from their accommodation, when the first text came in:<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Munch: guess what…<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: No. Tell me.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Munch: agatha.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: Yes, baby?<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Munch: guess!<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: No.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Five minutes passed. Agatha sighed before she texted back:<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: You’re actually Portuguese?<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Munch: ha. i’m deadpanning rn i hope you know. no, i got you berry methanol cigs.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Because Agatha had gone on a rant a couple of weeks ago about how it wasn’t fair that they didn’t sell them in the UK because she wanted to try them. Rio had let her go on for at least half an hour about how much more they would hit than a normal cigarette when drunk.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: STFU?!<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Munch: yup :)<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Munch: see you soon &lt;3<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Agatha locked her phone with the biggest smile on her face.<br/>
</p><p>“And what are you two smiling about?” Valarie asked as she pulled into a parking spot just outside their accommodation.<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing,” Jen replied as she too put down her phone.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re talking to your girlfriends, aren’t you?”<br/>
</p><p>Neither responded, their grins unwavering.<br/>
</p><p>“And when do I get to meet yours, Aggs? Jen hasn’t shut up about Alice, I’m surprised you don’t talk about yours more.”<br/>
</p><p>God, did she wish she could. She would yap about Rio-Sofia for hours on end if she were allowed.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re trying to keep it quiet.”<br/>
</p><p>Valarie turned to look at her, her eyebrows furrowed. “When are you ever quiet about anything?”<br/>
</p><p>Why did that feel like a punch to the gut?<br/>
</p><p>“Or maybe,” Jen jumped in. “She doesn’t want to talk about her relationship with her mum, you ever considered that, mother?”<br/>
</p><p>Valarie tilted her head in a ‘fair enough.’ “Right, out. I don’t want to get a ticket. You girls still want to grab dinner next week when I’m here for work?”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re buying, duh.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, please,” Agatha replied at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>“And this is why you aren’t my favourite daughter, Jennifer.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed as she pushed open her car door. “Bye, Val.”<br/>
</p><p>“Whatever. Bye, mum.”<br/>
</p><p>“Bye, girls, love you.”<br/>
</p><p>“We love you too.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen opened the boot, and they pulled out their bags before she closed it again.<br/>
</p><p>“Second term, babe,” Jen said as they entered their accommodation.<br/>
</p><p>“I know. Times flying by and – fucksake.”<br/>
</p><p>“Again?!”<br/>
</p><p>The lift was broken.<br/>
</p><p>“Fucking useless,” Jen muttered as they made their way to the stairs.<br/>
</p><p>“But I’m excited,” Agatha continued. “Plus, I gotta get my arse back into a club it’s been over a month.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen cackled. “Imagine you’re gonna be someone’s lawyer one day.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled a face. “Yeah, and I’m going to be a bloody brilliant one. You’re probably going to be snorting coke before you have to speak in commons.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen nudged her with a laugh. “Shut the fuck up. I’m never touching that stuff, that’s rich white men's activities.”<br/>
</p><p>It was Agatha’s turn to laugh.<br/>
</p><p>She tapped the key card against their door and…<br/>
</p><p>“BOO!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha and Jen screamed in unison.<br/>
</p><p>Alice and Rio burst out laughing, falling to the floor as they tried to suck in air.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you two fucking serious?!” Jen screeched with her hand over her heart.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to kill you both!” Agatha screamed.<br/>
</p><p>Their scolding fell on deaf ears as the laughter continued.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha climbed over her girlfriend and Alice fully intending to stomp off to her room when an arm grabbed her and spun her. Soft lips met hers and Agatha sighed. It’d been far too long since she’d felt them.<br/>
</p><p>God, she’d missed Rio so much.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, baby,” Rio grinned. “Sorry for scaring you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck off,” Agatha replied although she couldn’t stop smiling. “Your hair's cute,” she said as she twirled one of Rio’s bangs she’d left out of her ponytail.<br/>
</p><p>“Why thank you,” Rio replied as she planted a kiss to her cheek.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha giggled like a fucking school girl.<br/>
</p><p>“Gangs all here,” Alice said as she held Jen in her arms.<br/>
</p><p>“The world is right again,” Agatha quipped, which earned her some laughs.<br/>
</p><p>“Are we doing Christmas presents now?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>They’d all agreed to buy each other gifts during the break.<br/>
</p><p>“Can’t,” Rio replied. “I’ve got dinner with my mum. I had to beg her to let me come home for your arrival.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha frowned. She’d just gotten her girlfriend back, and now she was leaving again.<br/>
</p><p>“Great,” Agatha grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, don’t give me that,” Rio said softly. “I’ll be all yours tomorrow.”<br/>
</p><p>“Tomorrow?!” Agatha gaped.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry, mi amor. Princess duties, etc.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t pout.” Rio kissed her. “I gotta go. The cigs are on your bed.” She kissed her again. “Adios.”<br/>
</p><p>“Bye,” the girls replied in unison.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Stupid fucking princess duties.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio hadn’t missed 9 AMs. She didn’t know if it was the evening spent with her mother where she rehashed the rules of being back at uni, the added dates with more men she would have to go on this term, the lack of sleep, or what, but she was feeling extremely irritable this morning.<br/>
</p><p>She also couldn’t tell if it was because she was so irritable why she felt like everyone was looking at Agatha today. Yes, her girlfriend was in a miniskirt and hot, every person in London knew that, but that didn’t permit everyone in London to look.<br/>
</p><p>Eyes. They followed them as they sat down in the lecture hall for their Wednesday lecture. More specifically, a green pair that was to their left and a brown pair two rows below.<br/>
</p><p>Who were they and what the fuck did they want?<br/>
</p><p>“Why does that girl keep staring at you?” Rio whispered as Professor Calderu nattered away.<br/>
</p><p>“Hm?” Agatha replied, glasses on the tip of her nose, her head down in her notes.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded to the girl on their left, and Agatha turned to look.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha murmured before returning her gaze to her laptop.<br/>
</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes and waited for Agatha to explain. When she didn’t, her tone took on a bite as she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha.”<br/>
</p><p>And the shift was so drastic that her girlfriend’s head snapped up to look at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Who. Is. That?”<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes dilated before she swallowed.<br/>
</p><p>“Just this girl I used to fuck.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared at her, that irritation that had been plaguing her all morning growing steadily. Agatha waited for a response, and Rio decided she wouldn’t give her one. She could process this normally. The fact that someone else had touched her girlfriend the way she had was perfectly fine.<br/>
</p><p>Her gaze returned to her laptop, and she began typing away as if her blood wasn’t hot enough to burn.<br/>
</p><p>“Is that it?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm.”<br/>
</p><p>“Why do I feel like you’re mad?”<br/>
</p><p>“Why would I be mad that some girl can’t keep her fucking eyes off you?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Can’t help that I’m hot.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh. So that’s how she wants to play it.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>A smile slid onto Rio’s lips as she looked at Agatha again. “Oh, I know you are,” Rio replied. “But you’re dating me now.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha quirked an eyebrow. “Is that supposed to mean something to people? No one knows you are.”<br/>
</p><p>Her girlfriend had chosen violence today.<br/>
</p><p>It was a good thing Rio’s blood was already scalding.<br/>
</p><p>“Is that a dig, baby?” She whispered.<br/>
</p><p>“Not a dig, just a fact,” Agatha replied nonchalantly.<br/>
</p><p>“They’ll know.”<br/>
</p><p>“Pardon?”<br/>
</p><p>“They’ll know.” Rio left it at that.<br/>
</p><p>As the lecture continued, green and brown eyes kept looking in their direction, and Rio had to keep rolling her neck before she did something stupid like swing. She’d decided earlier on that she wasn’t going to engage with them, that she’d let them know after the break, but that plan…<br/>
</p><p>That plan was going to complete and utter shit because Agatha was entertaining it.<br/>
</p><p>Her girlfriend was an instigator through and through. Rio had seen the way she reacted to her earlier. Agatha was getting off on her jealousy because of course she fucking was.<br/>
</p><p>Those brown eyes in the row below turned around again, and she genuinely couldn’t help herself. Rio locked eyes with her and stared daggers into the other girl’s soul.<br/>
</p><p>The bitch held her gaze as if Rio couldn’t order her head of security to kill her right now…which of course she would never let Lucia do…<br/>
</p><p>Rio tilted her head an inch, her gaze unwavering as she dared the other girl to continue challenging her. That seemed to throw the girl off a little. She saw it in the way her shoulders dropped, the way her throat bobbled.<br/>
</p><p>Drive the knife in.<br/>
</p><p>Rio leaned forward, tipping her head so that you could only see the white in her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>Dead.<br/>
</p><p>The other girl turned around hastily. Didn’t look again.<br/>
</p><p>“If looks could kill,” Agatha muttered.<br/>
</p><p>Rio directed the same look at her girlfriend, who also shut up and returned to her work.<br/>
</p><p>For once, those years of having to learn to regulate her emotions seemed worth it. She channelled every bit of rage she had and focused it in her eyes. This look she’d mastered was one that even her brother was scared of.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>El diablo<em>. Carlos had called her once.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>And maybe today, she was.<br/>
</p><p>Green eyes were next. Her gaze climbed up Agatha’s form, focusing on her legs in her miniskirt, her lace bra poking out her V-neck long sleeve until they locked on to Rio watching her.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio smiled, it was cruel. It was a simple gesture. Rio pointed at herself, made a gun with her fingers aimed at her head and then pointed at the girl.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Keep looking at her, and I’ll kill you.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Simple.<br/>
</p><p>Message not received because this other bitch had the audacity to snort as if Rio was fucking joking.<br/>
</p><p>She shouldn’t have, but she did it anyway. She grabbed the pen next to her and, with Professor Calderu’s back turned and everyone’s heads down in their laptops, Rio threw it.<br/>
</p><p>The pen spun in the air before it hit the girl in the head. Thank fuck the cap was off. Now the girl had a black line on her forehead.<br/>
</p><p>So much for that princess-like control; it was just Agatha made her insane. Sure, most of the women at KCL had fucked her girlfriend, that was fine, but they no longer could. Agatha was hers now, and she had more than enough pens to go around.<br/>
</p><p>The green-eyed girl dared to look offended as if Rio hadn’t warned her. She turned around, her hand cradling her head with a sulk on her face.<br/>
</p><p>“So we’re throwing pens now?” Agatha scolded.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, baby, we both know you just came untouched by me doing that.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, and Rio shot her one last glare before she returned to her work.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Finally, they were let out for a fifteen-minute break. Agatha didn’t know what was going on with Rio-Sofia today, but she liked it…craved it even. The jealousy, how reckless yet controlled her girlfriend was being. It stirred up feelings within her that were almost animalistic.<br/>
</p><p>That’s why she egged on the girls staring at her, eye fucked them, teased them with lip bites and hair twirls knowing her girlfriend was closed to choking them…or her. Agatha would’ve been okay with that.<br/>
</p><p>They’d just stepped out of the lecture hall when Rio grabbed her wrist and tugged. Agatha put up no resistance as she was dragged along the corridors of their campus.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha?”<br/>
</p><p>And boy, did she know that voice. She didn’t bother hiding her grin.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, Iz.”<br/>
</p><p>The brunette walked over with a smile. “Haven’t seen you in a while, how were your Christmas holidays?”<br/>
</p><p>“Good,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>That grip on her wrist tightened.<br/>
</p><p>“How were yours?”<br/>
</p><p>“Good too. I missed you.”<br/>
</p><p>And now that grip almost hurt.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha was so turned on right now.<br/>
</p><p>“Doesn’t everyone?”<br/>
</p><p>Izzy nodded her agreement. “I was wondering if you were free to-”<br/>
</p><p>“She’s busy,” Rio cut in.<br/>
</p><p>“Am I?” Agatha challenged. “Because I don’t think-”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re busy,” Rio told her, glare drilling a hole in her skull.<br/>
</p><p>She tried to ignore the new wetness in her underwear.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, her grin unwavering. “No. I don’t think I am. What did you have in mind?”<br/>
</p><p>“I was thinking-”<br/>
</p><p>“Izzy.”<br/>
</p><p>A chill washed over Agatha with Rio’s tone.<br/>
</p><p>“She’s busy for the next century.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t have a chance to catch the laugh that left her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“I-”<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck. Off.” Rio ordered.<br/>
</p><p>Izzy did.<br/>
</p><p>“Wow. Way to-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha cut herself off when Rio yanked her into the seminar room next to them.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t have a second to think before Rio’s hands were on her waist, lifting her onto the lecturer’s desk behind her, her miniskirt riding up.<br/>
</p><p>“Easy access,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>“What-”<br/>
</p><p>The sentence went unfinished when her girlfriend moved her underwear to the side and slid three fingers in easily.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha groaned, her eyes rolling into the back of her head.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled the shoulder of her top down.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s it say? Read it to me,” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>How the fuck did Rio want her to know what anything said right now?<br/>
</p><p>“You tell me,” Agatha bit back.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s free hand yanked her chin forward.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha. What does it say?” Rio demanded.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s gaze shifted from dark brown to the strap of her bra where ‘Rio-Sofia’s’ was sewn into the strap.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia’s,” Agatha got out as her girlfriend’s fingers continued to pump.<br/>
</p><p>“Exactly. So what does that mean?”<br/>
</p><p>“You know exactly what it means,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Mi Inglés no es bueno.” <em>My English is no good.<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha scoffed before it turned into a gasp when Rio pressed her thumb against her clit.<br/>
</p><p>“Dime.” <em>Tell me.<br/>
</em></p><p>“N…no,” Agatha forced out as her orgasm built.<br/>
</p><p>“I will cut off your orgasm right now,” Rio growled.<br/>
</p><p>And she fucking would. The first time Rio ate her out and didn’t let her finish on Halloween sprung to mind.<br/>
</p><p>“It means you know how to fucking sew!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed, and Agatha felt her hand about to pull out. She grabbed onto Rio’s wrist to keep it there.<br/>
</p><p>“Yours.”<br/>
</p><p>“What was that?” Rio prompted as Agatha guided her fingers back in.<br/>
</p><p>“It means no one else can touch me but you. Yours,” Agatha continued.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pouted mockingly as she tucked Agatha’s hair behind her ear. “Now was that so hard, mi amor?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to fucking kill you,” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Then how will you ever come again?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t get to respond, a soft moan escaping her lips as Rio dipped her head down, her lips pressing against heated skin as she sucked, bit and licked Agatha’s pulse point. Her long fingers still pumping as her thumb rubbed ideally over Agatha’s clit.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s hand came up to grip Rio’s hair, pressing her firmer against her neck.<br/>
</p><p>Her thighs began to shake around Rio’s hand, and the sounds that were escaping her lips were downright pathetic. It was Rio’s tongue curling around her earlobe and sucking that pushed her over the edge.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha screamed as her orgasm crashed into her.<br/>
</p><p>“Shush!” Rio hushed, her free hand flying up to cover her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>That’s right because they were fucking on a deck in a seminar room at university.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s fingers continued to pump as she helped Agatha ride out her orgasm, her whimpers muffled behind the princess’s hand.<br/>
</p><p>Rio gently removed her fingers, and Agatha slumped against her.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re mine,” Rio whispered in her ear as she ran the hand that was once over her mouth through her hair. “Don’t you ever forget it,” Rio warned.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Won’t.”<br/>
</p><p>“Not that you will be any time soon,” Rio replied as she fixed Agatha’s panties.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows, and Rio took her phone out with a grin. She snapped a photo and showed it to her.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, you fucking bitch.”<br/>
</p><p>The biggest hickey known to man was blossoming on her neck.<br/>
</p><p>Rio slid the hair bubble off her wrist and handed it to Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“Hair up. I want everyone to see it.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes before she took it.<br/>
</p><p>“And hurry up, you’re gonna be late to the lecture,” Rio told her as she left the room.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes again, a smile on her lips as she began to tie her hair up.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio stared at her ceiling. She was pissed off for the second morning in a row.<br/>
</p><p>After her 9 AM lecture where she fucked her girlfriend during said lecture, she’d been ushered off to another date with a fucking man. And to make matters worse it was fucking Mateo again. Lucia had apologised a million times over when she broke the news, apologised again when it was revealed it wouldn’t just be lunch this time. No, it would be the entire fucking afternoon and evening.<br/>
</p><p>They’d gone to lunch, the cinema to watch some dumb ass film Mateo had picked and then dinner where Rio had drunk herself stupid. Sue her. She deserved it after getting through eight hours of hell.<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but feel like her mother knew something. This was the second evening in a row that she hadn’t been allowed to just be in the flat.<br/>
</p><p>Be with Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>As much as she loved being back home for the holidays, she’d forgotten she’d be thrusted into the world of Princess Rio-Sofia, second in line to the Spanish throne. She’d been out of the public eye for so long that she hadn’t remembered the constant need to perform.<br/>
</p><p>Thank fuck for the Christmas spent with her dad’s Puerto Rican side in the south. She and her Abuela were locked away in the kitchen for hours on end whilst they repeatedly kicked Carlos out for stealing food. Ana helping where she could.<br/>
</p><p>She tried to avoid her mother during Christmas Day because she didn’t want the usual comments: ‘Stop eating, Rio-Sofia, you’ll put on weight.’ ‘Drinking with your brother, Rio-Sofia? That’s not ladylike.’ ‘What are you wearing, Rio-Sofia? There’s a dress I picked out for you to put on.’<br/>
</p><p>It hadn’t worked. The comments came just the same.<br/>
</p><p>She also missed Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>It felt like she could never have everything she wanted. When she was in England, she missed Spain, and when she was in Spain, she missed Agatha. It was as if the universe knew she would never be able to have all that she wanted at once.<br/>
</p><p>To make matters worse, her mother had decided that she was ready to be in the public eye permanently again upon her return to London. That meant charity events, brunches with people in their circle, parading around with her mother when she visited.<br/>
</p><p>Like she said, Rio felt like her mother knew.<br/>
</p><p>So now she was on her bed staring up at her ceiling because she’d had to go another night without sleeping next to her girlfriend. She thought it best not to knock on Agatha’s door wasted like a deadbeat coming home after spending the night with their mistress.<br/>
</p><p>Her phone buzzing caught her attention. She picked it up and clicked it on:<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Princesa: Good morning, baby-<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Rio threw her phone down and squealed. Agatha had called her baby (Agatha always called her this). She picked up her phone again, read the message up until the word ‘baby,’ threw her phone down and squealed once again…<br/>
</p><p>…She did this four times.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Princesa: Baby? Yes, or no?<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Baby.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio went to squeal and throw her phone down again when she realised she probably needed to reply since Agatha had sent the first text…TEN MINUTES AGO?!<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Princesa: Good morning, baby. Me and Jen are going to Blank Street. Do you want your usual?<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio: buenos días, mi amor. Sí, por favor, gracias.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Princesa: No pasa nada x<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Joder.<em> Fuck.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>Rio was such a fucking simp.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Half an hour later, Rio heard their front door slam. She didn’t hesitate to leap off her bed and dash into the corridor.<br/>
</p><p>“Ten cuidado, princesa.” <em>Be careful, princess.<em> Lucia warned when Rio tripped over her own feet to greet Agatha.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Her girlfriend yelped when she picked her up and spun her whilst dotting kisses on her face.<br/>
</p><p>“Ten cuidado, bebe. The drinks,” Agatha laughed as she held an iced white chocolate matcha and iced caramel latte.<br/>
</p><p>“Missed you,” Rio said, putting her down.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed in response. “Is that a new perfume?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes. Carlos got it for me for Christmas and- oh shit! You don’t like lavender, do you?” Rio started wiping at her skin as if it would rid it of the scent.<br/>
</p><p>“No, it’s fine,” Agatha replied. “I like it now.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice opened her door then, a smile on her lips when she took in Jen holding her drink.<br/>
</p><p>“Why didn’t you run out of your room when you heard the door like Rio did?” Jen snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“I was on the phone with my mum,” Alice replied, her smile unwavering.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed as Agatha handed her, her drink.<br/>
</p><p>“Sure,” Jen replied, begrudgingly giving Alice hers.<br/>
</p><p>“Eres tan divertida.” <em>You’re so funny.<em> Alice said through a laugh.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Translate.”<br/>
</p><p>“She’s laughing at you,” Agatha smiled. “When are you going to start learning Spanish for your girlfriend, Jen?”<br/>
</p><p>“You only know Spanish because you’ve done it for most your life. You had a head start,” Jen bit back. “I did French for my A Levels.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, tu connais Français?” <em>Oh, you know French?<em> Rio asked.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Erm…” Jen started.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Oh, come on, Jen! Even I know that.”<br/>
</p><p>“It’s been two years since I’ve touched that language, leave it out!” Jen snapped, which earned her laughter in response.<br/>
</p><p>They made their way to the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>“Just out of curiosity…how many languages do you speak?”<br/>
</p><p>“Five,” Rio replied. “Spanish, English, French, German and Portuguese.”<br/>
</p><p>She watched as her girlfriend’s eyes dilated, watched her pull her bottom lip into her mouth, and Rio laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Chica abjo.” <em>Down girl.<em> Rio grinned.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Puta.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio cackled as she sat down around the island.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait, are we not doing Christmas presents?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh fuck, yeah. Let’s get them. I’ll grab Nat,” Alice said as they headed for their rooms.<br/>
</p><p>Five minutes later, they were back in the kitchen. Natasha waltzing in, Alice behind.<br/>
</p><p>“You whores miss me?” She greeted.<br/>
</p><p>Jen, Agatha and Rio grinned as they got up to hug her.<br/>
</p><p>“Maybe,” Jen said.<br/>
</p><p>“Course,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Was missing my daily dose of Russian bitch,” Rio followed.<br/>
</p><p>“Why, thank you, princesa. I certainly was not missing you…Lucia, however…” Rio nudged her as Natasha let go.<br/>
</p><p>The girls sat around the island and swapped gifts before they opened them.<br/>
</p><p>“You got me a camcorder?!” Alice shrieked.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah. Not sure you deserve it anymore-”<br/>
</p><p>Alice shut Jen up with a kiss.<br/>
</p><p>“I love it! Thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen tried and failed to fight the smile forming on her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re using that tonight,” Natasha said. “We’re still going out, right?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio went to protest when Natasha cut her off. “I spoke to Cia; she’s coming with. You’re allowed out.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “I don’t believe-”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re coming,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was going.<br/>
</p><p>Alice had gotten Jen a mini fridge for her skincare products, Natasha had gotten them a bottle of bedazzled vodka each from Russia, Jen had gotten Natasha a new speaker, Rio a gift card for <em>Foot Locker<em> and Agatha…<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Oh, you bitch,” Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Jen had gotten her…<br/>
</p><p>“Handcuffs? Lube? A blindfold?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio swallowed, the thought of Agatha handcuffed flashing before her eyes. The thought of Agatha handcuffing her next.<br/>
</p><p>“Thought it was best I didn’t give this one to you in front of mum.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey! Don’t act like you and Rio won’t use them. You two fucked in a changing room.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha and Rio stared at her wide-eyed.<br/>
</p><p>“You did what?!” Natasha gaped. “No fair! I want to do that.”<br/>
</p><p>“You know?” Alice said.<br/>
</p><p>“You do?” Jen questioned.<br/>
</p><p>“Of course!”<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck?! Why didn’t you tell me?” They said in unison.<br/>
</p><p>“Anyways!” Rio said loudly.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled out her gift from Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>It was a silver ‘A’ necklace, except the ‘A’ was decorated with multiple different plants…Rio’s favourites.<br/>
</p><p>Lavenders. Azaleas. Ferns.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared in disbelief.<br/>
</p><p>“You hate it,” Agatha said, trying to grab it.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio shook her head, batting her hand away. “No, it’s my most prized possession.”<br/>
</p><p>And Rio owned tiaras, a mansion, a forest green Ferrari Portofino.<br/>
</p><p>“It is?” Agatha asked quietly.<br/>
</p><p>“It is. Help me put it on, mi amor.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha did so, moving Rio’s ponytail to the side so she could clasp the necklace together.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha was finished Rio looked down at the sliver pendant, her heart so fucking full she thought it might explode.<br/>
</p><p>“Gracias, princesa.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched at the last word before Rio stole a kiss, that warm sensation spreading around her heart, wrapping it in a warm blanket of lov-<br/>
</p><p>Something.<br/>
</p><p>“You two make me sick,” Natasha scoffed. “Your present, Aggs.”<br/>
</p><p>“Right,” Agatha said as she pulled away.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had gotten her a <em>Jellycat<em> lilac bunny. She’d sewn a white fabric with little lavenders into the ears. It smelt of lavender too, and she scolded herself for forgetting her girlfriend hadn’t liked lavender until twenty minutes ago. She’d just thought pretty purple flower and thought of Agatha.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Her gift seemed fucking pathetic now.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay I fucking love this!” Agatha exclaimed as she pressed the bunny to her chest.<br/>
</p><p>“You do?” Rio asked the same time:<br/>
</p><p>“Who knew London’s most notorious retired fuckboy is actually a huge softy,” Natasha quipped.<br/>
</p><p>Jen cackled. “You don’t even know the half of it.”<br/>
</p><p>“Shut the fuck up,” Agatha snapped. “And yes, I do. Thank you, Rio-Sofia.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Rio-Sofia.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The only person on the planet who could’ve made her fall in love with her first name.<br/>
</p><p>“Alright you lot,” Natasha said, clapping her hands. “I gotta go, but see you all later for pres.”<br/>
</p><p>The girls uttered their goodbyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Can you do my eyeliner tonight, please, baby?” Agatha asked as they got up.<br/>
</p><p>“Course.”<br/>
</p><p>“And Al, bring your camera,” Natasha called from down the hall.<br/>
</p><p>“Course.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>If only Rio wasn’t giving her shit would she be able to fully appreciate how good she looked. The princess was wearing black baggy jeans, her red boxers poking out the top, a black tight fitted short sleeve button up, only the first button done to reveal her red lace bra that matched her underwear. She was also dripping in silver jewellery, her abs and belly button piercing on show.<br/>
</p><p>Like Agatha said, if Rio wasn’t giving her shit, she’d be foaming at the mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio repeated for what felt like the one thousandth time.<br/>
</p><p>Alice shook her head. “Tu novia es blanca.” <em>Your girlfriend is white.<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio blinked in disbelief. “No.”<br/>
</p><p>“Es <em>blanca<em>,” Alice mumbled.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Estás mintiendo, bebé.” <em>You’re lying, baby.<em> Rio said like a plea.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Natasha swallowed her rum and coke before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs, I’m Russian and even I don’t get that.”<br/>
</p><p>“You also grew up in South London,” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“You get plain chicken at Nando’s, Agatha?!” Rio screeched.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “It’s not that deep.”<br/>
</p><p>That earned her a series of protests.<br/>
</p><p>“Give up now,” Jen started. “I’ve been trying to get her to try something else for years.”<br/>
</p><p>“Mi amor,” Rio said, dropping to her knees dramatically.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha folded her arms with a huff as Rio-Sofia put her hands on her thighs.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Please<em>, can I get you to try lemon and herb at least!”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes again before they landed on her girlfriend on her knees looking up at her with her stupid fucking doe eyes, hands clasped in prayer.<br/>
</p><p>A sudden rush of heat shot through her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blamed the alcohol because there was no way she was getting heated over this.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>For fucksake.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>When she felt the new stickiness of her underwear.<br/>
</p><p>The princess made her so fucking easy, like pathetic men that got boners just from eye contact.<br/>
</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha said because Rio had to stop looking at her like that.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes!” Rio replied as the rest of the girls cheered.<br/>
</p><p>Rio sat on the sofa and tugged Agatha onto her lap.<br/>
</p><p>“Medium will change your life,” Rio said as she reached for her drink.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “You said lemon and herb.”<br/>
</p><p>“Did I?” Rio feigned obliviousness as she took a sip.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes!”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t recall.”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio giggled.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Yeah…so the girls were drunk.<br/>
</p><p>Alice had her camcorder out and Agatha was pulling faces in front of it, <em>Von dutch by Charli xcx<em> playing through Natasha’s new speaker when Rio said:<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“No, you’ve gotta get her full fit, Al.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice stepped back so the camera caught her low-waisted flared jeans and leopard print trim laced cami.<br/>
</p><p>Rio got up and spun her so that Alice got all of her outfit before pulling away as if to give Agatha the spotlight.<br/>
</p><p>“No, get in it,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Now presenting…” Alice boomed from behind the camera. “La Princesa de España y her novia!”<br/>
</p><p>Alice panned to Jen and Natasha, who were bowing and curtsying.<br/>
</p><p>When Alice pulled the camera back on them, Rio-Sofia was planting a deep kiss on her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“You gotta play this video on their wedding day.” Agatha heard Natasha say.<br/>
</p><p>Rio grinned when they broke apart.<br/>
</p><p>“You fucked our lip combos,” Agatha laughed. She tried to wipe at Rio’s pink chin when her girlfriend batted her hand away.<br/>
</p><p>“Leave it!”<br/>
</p><p>“You wanna go out with both of our lip glosses down your chin?” Agatha poked her.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Rio pouted.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed again.<br/>
</p><p>“Princesa,” Lucia warned. “You can’t…remember.”<br/>
</p><p>“Joder.” <em>Fuck.<br/>
</em></p><p>She let Agatha wipe her face.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, let’s go! I wanna dance,” Natasha said, knocking her drink back and grabbing Lucia’s hand, dragging her out the room.<br/>
</p><p>The other girls followed, giggles floating out their mouths.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>So…Rio was fucked.<br/>
</p><p>Fucked alcoholically, fucked because she was definitely getting exposed tonight. There was absolutely no fucking way she was keeping her hands off her girlfriend. Not when Agatha was wearing those low waisted jeans and her tits were spilling out of her cami top.<br/>
</p><p>At first, Lucia was keeping her in check, reminding her to stare and not touch. Natasha had since taken all of her head of security’s attention. Which, good for them. Natasha had been plotting on Lucia since day one.<br/>
</p><p>The two cigarettes from Agatha’s pack that Rio bought her which they shared weren’t helping either, only adding to the way she craved her girlfriend.<br/>
</p><p>She should have learnt her lesson by now, right? That she couldn’t be stupid when drunk. That’s how she’d been caught kissing that girl; that’s why she’d kissed Natasha, and Wanda had gotten pictures of them.<br/>
</p><p>Bad things happen in threes.<br/>
</p><p>If she weren’t smart, it was basically fate that she and Agatha would get photographed kissing.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I don’t think I care.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>But drunk Rio doesn’t care.<br/>
</p><p>They walked into the club, pinkies linked.<br/>
</p><p>Jen bought them a round of vodka shots which they downed before they headed to the dance floor. <em>West Ten by AJ Tracey, Mabel<em> was playing.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I fucking love this song!” Jen yelled, which earned her agreements from the other British girls.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve never heard it,” Alice replied.<br/>
</p><p>“What?!” Jen, Natasha and Agatha said in unison.<br/>
</p><p>“Neither,” Rio added.<br/>
</p><p>The group pushed through the crowd until they found a space.<br/>
</p><p>“Can’t believe you don’t know this song!” Agatha said, spinning on her from where she’d been leading the way.<br/>
</p><p>She started mouthing the lyrics:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Don’t you know I’m walking away? Now I’m in my own space. Babe, you know I ain’t waiting for you.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows because what in the British was this song?<br/>
</p><p>Natasha and Jen joined in as they started chanting the words along with every person in the club. People knew this song as if it were the national anthem.<br/>
</p><p>“You all love this song, huh?” Rio laughed as Agatha started jumping, her hands locking with Rio’s to encourage her to join in.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Know I ain’t waiting for you,”<em> Agatha and the rest of the club yelled along.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“I’m gonna request a song,” Alice said into Rio’s ear before she disappeared into the crowd.<br/>
</p><p>When West Ten ended, the girls were panting with lazy smiles on their faces.<br/>
</p><p>“Fucking banger!” Natasha shouted above the next song…<br/>
</p><p>“No fucking way!”<br/>
</p><p>“How?” Lucia and Rio said at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>“I told you I was going to ask for a song request,” Alice appeared.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Despues De La 1 by Cris MJ, FloyyMenor, LOUKI<em> rang out from the club speakers. A few confused glances were passed before people started moving to the music.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“You know this song?” Rio asked as she pulled Agatha in by the waist.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s a great song to dance to.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows before Rio turned her, a hand sliding around her girlfriend’s stomach pressing her against her. Agatha laughed until it was cut off with a gasp when the beat dropped and Rio started swaying her hips, guiding Agatha’s with the arm around her body.<br/>
</p><p>They moved to the beat, Agatha pushing her ass against Rio’s cunt.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio was no one’s strongest soldier.<br/>
</p><p>Her head fell to the crook of Agatha’s neck, and Agatha’s hand flew up to grasp Rio’s hair, bunching it, pulling, as if she physically needed Rio to ground herself to reality.<br/>
</p><p>Maybe Agatha did.<br/>
</p><p>Rio certainly did.<br/>
</p><p>She wasn’t sure when the hand on Agatha’s waist slid further, resting half on heated skin, half dangerously close to where Rio wanted to put her face and fingers later.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t know how she heard it over all the noise, but she heard Agatha moan, her head falling back to rest on Rio’s.<br/>
</p><p>Rio spun Agatha before they committed public indecency…which they had been so close to committing already.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pressed their foreheads together, their hands finding each other’s waists as they slowed their movements to keep up with the music’s new pace.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>She’s gonna kill me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Deep blue eyes were fucking mesmerising in the flashing lights of the night club. A slow smirk slid across Agatha’s lips before she leaned in. And it wasn’t like Rio was a god with remarkable self-control or some shit, she was a mere mortal. How could she <em>not<em> kiss her irresistible girlfriend?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She closed the distance. Agatha slid her tongue in, and Rio let her. Agatha pulled her closer, and Rio let her. Agatha was kissing her in the middle of a fucking dance floor in a club in Central London…<br/>
</p><p>And Rio let her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled back, that grin unwavering. Rio would never be able to help it, the grin that followed.<br/>
</p><p>“You can’t do that,” Rio tried to scold.<br/>
</p><p>“And yet you let me.”<br/>
</p><p>And yet she had.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked like she wanted to kiss her again, and Rio decided to be smart for once. Well…sort of. She kept eye contact as Agatha held her waist, swaying her hips in the most provocative way she could as she lowered herself before rising again.<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes turned black, and Rio grinned.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay, baby?” She rasped in Agatha’s ear.<br/>
</p><p>Her girlfriend was biting her bottom lip, eyes filled with desperation.<br/>
</p><p>If she could, Rio would’ve put this image in the Louvre.<br/>
</p><p>“Not okay then?” Rio answered for her with a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“Take me home. You need to fuck me.” Was all Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, princesa,” came the reply.</p>

<p>Fucking princess duties.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha woke up, Rio was gone. Her girlfriend had left a note saying she had to go to some bruncheon with the queen, which was fine (absolutely not fucking fine).<br/>
</p><p>Recently, it felt like they didn’t have it. Time. Rio was always being shipped off to some place or another. They’d spend the morning together; Rio had to be gone in the afternoon. They’d fuck all night like they had yesterday, but they couldn’t wake up together. They might as well be doing long distance again like they were during the Christmas holidays.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her wrists; they still felt raw from the handcuffs (she made a mental note to buy her best friend coffee as a thank you) before she picked up her phone.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Munch: morning, mi amor. sorry i had to leave, but i’ll see you later.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Agatha reacted to the message with a heart and then started scrolling through her social media. Her eyes narrowed when the first video on her for you page was of her girlfriend. Ever since Rio had begun making more public appearances, the edits, thirst tweets, and photos of her had spiked significantly.<br/>
</p><p>The video was an edit to <em>Timeless by The Weekend<em>. Two emotions overcame Agatha. Lust. The editor had only chosen clips where Rio-Sofia was wearing suits. Anger. The comment section was also lusting over the fact that the editor had only chosen clips of Rio-Sofia wearing suits.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<strong>Chloe:<br/>
<em>born to ride or wtv lana said<br/>
</em></strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Alex:<br/>
<em>I’m so gay.<br/>
</em></strong>
</p><p>
<strong>E&lt;3:<br/>
<em>why is there a tear running down my thigh?<br/>
</em></strong>
</p><p>Agatha needed a gun.<br/>
</p><p>How dare these random girls on the internet thirst over <em>her<em> princess. Hello? Couldn’t they tell she had a girlfriend?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha begrudgingly saved the video to her ‘Rio-Sofia’ folder and moved on…to another edit of Rio.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos featured in this one, that song Agatha hated ‘At the same damn time’ or however the fuck it went behind it.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>aisha:<br/>
<em>fuck the monarchy ;)<br/>
</em></strong>
</p><p>
<strong>LJ:<br/>
<em>Good day to be bisexual.<br/>
</em></strong>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes before reporting the editing account for ‘Inappropriate Content.’<br/>
</p><p>Luckily, the next video was of Primrose Hill at sunset, which reminded Agatha she needed to take Rio one evening.<br/>
</p><p>Her luck was short-lived when <em>another<em> edit of Rio-Sofia graced her phone screen, but this edit wasn’t a thirst trap. No, this video was to Lana Del Ray’s Brooklyn Baby instrumental.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha had to sit up.<br/>
</p><p>The video contained Rio-Sofia’s quieter moments. The princess was always in the background at some royal event, fiddling with her hands, her doe eyes fixed on something off camera. A warm smile here, a tilt of her tiara there.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia’s beauty was almost poetic, like it had been written by the most descriptive author, painted by the most skilled painter, worked out by the most intelligent mathematician.<br/>
</p><p>It spoke volumes even in the princess’s quietest moments.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was so in love with her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Hold on-<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>No, no, no. I’m not in love...<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha was in love.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Am I even capable of it?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She exited the app, not ready to deal with whatever can of worms she’d accidentally opened.<br/>
</p><p>Twitter, for once, with its copious thirst tweets about her girlfriend, was welcomed.<br/>
</p><p>The same set of photos flooded her timeline; they must’ve been from today because Agatha hadn’t seen them before. Her girlfriend was wearing a black knitted long-sleeved turtle neck, a white miniskirt and black knee-high boots. Her hair was blown out, and her makeup was soft like it always was when she had to be the Princess of Spain.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was standing outside the royal car with the queen, Lucia, behind. The wind had caught her hair in some images; others she looked like the picture-perfect princess she was supposed to be.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Hole for Rio-Sofia:<br/>
<em>Is it treason to say I am merely a hole for Princess Rio-Sofia?<br/>
</em></strong>
</p><p>Agatha pulled a face. Did these people not have any shame?<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Mol:<br/>
<em>Wowsers I just made a mess in my trousers.<br/>
</em></strong>
</p><p>The only person who Rio was allowed to make a mess in her trousers was Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Tiyaaaa:<br/>
<em>does she have a girlfriend, and can she fight?<br/>
</em></strong>
</p><p>Yes. Rio did have a girlfriend, and yes. Agatha could fight.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio-Sofia’s gf:<br/>
<em>why do you guys keep reposting my gf?<br/>
</em></strong>
</p><p>Agatha saw fucking red. User @riosofsgf was not Rio’s girlfriend; Agatha was!<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t hesitate to report multiple posts on @riosofsgf account before blocking them.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha needed to do better. Reporting and blocking the crazy lesbians going after her princess was not enough. She needed to terrorise them.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pressed the ‘add new account’ button and got to work.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Stupid fucking princess duties.<br/>
</p><p>The queen was in London for the <em>Ruiz Watches<em> bruncheon, and she requested Rio join her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>Requested<em>, as if Rio could decline.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>Rio hadn’t gone three days without something pissing her off. Today it was because she had to leave her beautiful girlfriend sound asleep to get her hair and makeup done by the royal stylists at stupid o’clock in the morning.<br/>
</p><p>She tugged at her turtleneck as she followed her mother through the event, Lucia and their security guards a few steps behind. Heads turned at their presence. The whispers and points Rio would never get used to followed. And then…<br/>
</p><p>Fucking Mateo.<br/>
</p><p>She’d seen enough of that boy this week to last her a lifetime.<br/>
</p><p>“Stop fidgeting,” her mother muttered under her breath when Rio pulled at her turtleneck again.<br/>
</p><p>Rio suppressed an eyeroll as she dropped her hand.<br/>
</p><p>Mateo and his father, Miguel, greeted them with smiles.<br/>
</p><p>“Queen Isabella, Princess Rio-Sofia,” Miguel said as he and his son bowed.<br/>
</p><p>Mateo took Rio’s hand and kissed it like he usually did, and this time Rio didn’t have the energy to hide her disgust.<br/>
</p><p>“Eugh.”<br/>
</p><p>Her mother shot her a look, and Rio steeled herself.<br/>
</p><p>Mateo nor his father seemed to notice.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re so pleased to have you this morning, Your Majesty,” Miguel continued.<br/>
</p><p>The queen nodded, waited…<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you for having us,” Rio said on cue.<br/>
</p><p>Miguel bowed his head again. “I must go now, but I hope to speak with you both soon.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio would prefer if he didn’t.<br/>
</p><p>She and her mother nodded, and Miguel bowed once more before her left.<br/>
</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn’t take Mateo with him.<br/>
</p><p>“Please, Rio-Sofia. If you’d like to follow me, we are sitting together.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio forced herself not to pull a face. She glanced at her mother who smiled and pushed her to join Mateo.<br/>
</p><p>The table Rio had to sit at was filled with people she’d met at similar events. Half of them were her age, the rest older.<br/>
</p><p>They all got up and bowed or curtsied when she arrived, and Mateo pulled out a chair for her.<br/>
</p><p>“Good morning, Princess Rio-Sofia,” they greeted.<br/>
</p><p>“Good morning,” Rio replied with that practised smile.<br/>
</p><p>The next god knows how long were filled with questions about her studies, Carlos, and how she was adjusting to life in London.<br/>
</p><p>“Apparently, you two are getting married?” The girl, Alexia, if Rio remembered correctly, asked.<br/>
</p><p>She tugged at her turtleneck. “Where did you hear that?” Rio forced a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>Alexia shrugged. “People talk, Rio-Sofia.”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, they don’t talk to me. We’re not getting married. I’m focusing on my education.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t give a fuck about her law degree.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s good though,” Alexia continued. “You’re going to have all of Spain jealous of you. You know how anyone who is anyone wants Mateo, especially the people in our circle. Of course, our princess would be the only one lucky enough to marry him.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled a face. If Spain knew who her girlfriend was, they’d be far more envious.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not marrying him,” Rio said matter-of-factly.<br/>
</p><p>“Yet,” Alexia grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled at her turtleneck.<br/>
</p><p>It didn’t stop after that. The comments about marriage, weddings, Mateo.<br/>
</p><p>The side of Rio’s neck started to sting from where she kept nicking it with her nails as she tugged on her jumper.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio turned to see her mother.<br/>
</p><p>“Come with me for a moment, please.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, excusing herself from the table and following her mother to a secluded corridor.<br/>
</p><p>“Stop fidgeting,” the queen ordered. “I’ve been watching you pull at your clothing all morning.”<br/>
</p><p>“I didn’t realise-”<br/>
</p><p>“Princesses do not pull at their clothes,” her mother interrupted. “So stop it. Are we clear?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, mother.”<br/>
</p><p>“Now say it again, clearer this time and annunciate.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her tongue to stop herself from snapping at her mother before she repeated, “Yes, mother.”<br/>
</p><p>“I never have to say these things to Carlos,” the queen huffed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio dropped her head.<br/>
</p><p>“Return to the table,” her mother told her.<br/>
</p><p>“I- please may I go to the toilet?”<br/>
</p><p>“Quickly,” the queen snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Rio left without another word.<br/>
</p><p>She slipped inside the toilet and entered the closest cubicle. She didn’t know when her breathing had ramped up, but all of a sudden, she couldn’t breathe. Rio yanked at her turtleneck, feeling as if it were cutting off her airflow.<br/>
</p><p>It wasn’t helping.<br/>
</p><p>She needed to rip it off.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled desperately, tears pricking her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I never have to say these things to Carlos.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Apparently, you two are getting married?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Stop fidgeting.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>You’re going to have all of Spain jealous of you.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Stop fidgeting.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Why can’t you be more like you’re brother?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Stop fidgeting.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Her thoughts screamed at her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio clawed at her jumper, her nails digging into her skin.<br/>
</p><p>That suffocating feeling she knew all too well squeezed her heart.<br/>
</p><p>A gift she’d gotten in Spain, an anxiety diagnosis.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos had found her in a similar state during a Christmas event and forced her to go to the royal health professionals who told her what she’d already suspected.<br/>
</p><p>The queen had denied it, stating princessess didn’t have ‘problems.’<br/>
</p><p>If only it were that easy. If only Rio could turn around and say, ‘No, I don’t have anxiety.’<br/>
</p><p>Rio slid down the cubicle door.<br/>
</p><p>She couldn’t think. What usually calmed her down?<br/>
</p><p>
<em>How about if I-<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Stop fidgeting.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Why can’t you be more like you’re brother?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Why can’t you be more like you’re brother?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Stop fidgeting.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She dragged her nails down her neck again, the pain making her wince…the pain making her thoughts a little quieter.<br/>
</p><p>She did it again.<br/>
</p><p>Same result.<br/>
</p><p>She started digging her nails into her palms.<br/>
</p><p>Those screams became whispers.<br/>
</p><p>She shivered when something cold hit her chest. Rio furrowed her eyebrows, digging underneath her jumper to pull out the ‘A’ necklace Agatha had given her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio clasped the pendant with her left hand as she dug her nails into her right.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I’m just…happy.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha’s voice broke through vitriolic thoughts.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I want you in every way you could want a person.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Don’t fight me. We both know you can’t.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha’s smile flashed in Rio’s brain; her laugh joined it.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Is that so?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Thank you, Rio-Sofia.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio’s breathing evened out, and she wiped at unshed tears.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Baby, I want you and only you.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She took three deep breaths for good measure before she got up and dusted herself off.<br/>
</p><p>Rio exited the cubicle, blinked when she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror. She’d smudged her mascara.<br/>
</p><p>“Fucksake,” Rio muttered as she ran her fingers under her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>Once she’d fixed her appearance and tucked her necklace underneath her jumper, Rio placed that practised smile on her face and left the toilet.<br/>
</p><p>Her mother shot her a suspicious look when she took her place at the table. She ignored it, returning to forced conversations, digging her nails into her palms whenever everything felt too much.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>After Rio’s morning of hell, she was back in her room. She’d changed out of that godforsaken turtleneck, putting on a <em>Real Madrid<em> jersey and grey baggy sweatpants.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>A thunderstorm warning had been announced on the car journey home. Rain beat against Rio’s window; the candles dotted around her room producing the only light. She looked down at her palms, at the indents she’d stabbed into them.<br/>
</p><p>Rio needed to get a grip.<br/>
</p><p>Hurting herself to get a hold of reality was not how she was supposed to deal with things, and as a princess especially.<br/>
</p><p>Princesses were supposed to be better as her mother always said. Their heads didn’t get fucked; they didn’t have panic attacks at public appearances. They handled pressure as easily as breathing.<br/>
</p><p>She closed her eyes, head resting against her headboard as she tried to rein in her thoughts, tried to ebb the tightening feeling that was squeezing her heart again.<br/>
</p><p>Three knocks on the wall.<br/>
</p><p>“Darlin?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah?” But Rio’s voice barely carried.<br/>
</p><p>A moment later, Agatha was in her room sitting on her bed.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Qué pasa?” <em>What’s wrong?<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio peeled her eyes open.<br/>
</p><p>“How do you know something’s wrong?"<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled a face. “You spoke to me different.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“You were quiet.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t elaborate.<br/>
</p><p>“What does that mean?” Rio pressed.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stared at her before she sighed. “You were quiet in the way you are when you’re unsure. You’re never unsure when you speak to me…not anymore.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not,” Rio found herself saying.<br/>
</p><p>“I know. That’s why I know something's wrong. What is it, love?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip. They weren’t supposed to lie to each other.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha studied her, her gaze sweeping until they landed on Rio’s bruised palms. She tried to hide her hands before Agatha grabbed them.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s noth-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio was silenced when Agatha kissed the indents on both palms then locked their hands together.<br/>
</p><p>“Your anxiety, baby?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded, squeezing tighter.<br/>
</p><p>That suffocating feeling around Rio’s heart started to subside.<br/>
</p><p>“You…” Rio paused, building up the courage to get out: “You know how you said your mother makes you feel weak?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded again.<br/>
</p><p>“So does mine. She says a princess doesn’t have…<em>problems<em>, and if they do, they are better at concealing them.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha started rubbing her thumbs soothingly, urging Rio on.<br/>
</p><p>“Sometimes I- I feel like there’s been a mistake. That someone else who is actually fit to be a princess should be me instead. Because…well, I just keep fucking up.”<br/>
</p><p>“Having anxiety doesn’t mean you’re fucking up,” Agatha told her. “You didn’t choose to have it.”<br/>
</p><p>“But it’s more than that,” Rio said. “It’s getting caught kissing a girl, it’s Wanda, it’s-”<br/>
</p><p>“Over with,” Agatha cut in. “Those things are behind you. You’re human, you’re allowed to make mistakes. Being a princess doesn’t change that.”<br/>
</p><p>“My mother doesn’t seem to think so.”<br/>
</p><p>Her girlfriend breathed in, seemingly holding her tongue before she got out:<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia. You’re allowed to make mistakes.”<br/>
</p><p>And Agatha had said it with such certainty that this time, Rio believed her.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. “Okay.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned her hands over and started running her thumbs over the indents.<br/>
</p><p>“If you ever feel like hurting yourself…can you call me instead, please?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha hadn’t looked up; her eyes trained on her movements. Rio watched her for a moment, let the drumming of rain against her window fill the void before saying:<br/>
</p><p>“Okay.”<br/>
</p><p>“I mean it. <em>Please<em>, call me.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I will.”<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes glazed with tears met brown.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t cry, bebe,” Rio soothed, moving to pull Agatha into her arms. “I won’t do it again.”<br/>
</p><p>She felt Agatha nod against her shoulder.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled back to wipe at Agatha’s tears before she planted a tender kiss to perfect lips.<br/>
</p><p>“I promise,” Rio breathed.</p>

<p>Agatha liked Carlos for a number of reasons; the biggest one to date was sneaking Rio a suit to wear to the latest social event she had to attend.<br/>
</p><p>Her girlfriend was sulking about the frilly white number that Lucia had given her. The queen’s requested dress attire. Carlos had shown up twenty minutes later with a black <em>YSL<em> suit. Agatha helped button up the white shirt, helped tie the maroon and white striped tie, helped buckle up the black stilettos.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She couldn’t help it, couldn’t keep her hands off Rio-Sofia.<br/>
</p><p>“My handsome prince,” Agatha breathed as she ran her fingers through Rio’s hair.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes before she planted a kiss on Agatha’s lips.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha giggled before she wiped at Rio’s chin. “You fucked your lipstick.”<br/>
</p><p>“And I’d mess it up ten times over if it meant kissing you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled before she pushed at Rio’s face. “You make me sick.”<br/>
</p><p>Her girlfriend grinned.<br/>
</p><p>A knock on the door.<br/>
</p><p>“Fia, you ready? We gotta go,” Carlos called.<br/>
</p><p>“Sí,” Rio replied. She kissed Agatha on the cheek. “See you later.”<br/>
</p><p>“See you. And remember to call if you-”<br/>
</p><p>“Promise.” Rio pecked her.<br/>
</p><p>“You fucked your lipstick again,” Agatha scolded.<br/>
</p><p>“Sue a girl,” Rio said as she walked to the door.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, wait, are you gonna be back in time for Natasha’s party?”<br/>
</p><p>“Should be.”<br/>
</p><p>“What’s this about a party?” Carlos asked when Rio opened the door.<br/>
</p><p>“None,” Rio pushed him. “Of your business.”<br/>
</p><p>“Mine,” Natasha’s voice sounded from the corridor. “And you must be Spain’s future king.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha walked to her door to see Carlos and Natasha shaking hands.<br/>
</p><p>“And you must be Natasha.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, Your Majesty,” Natasha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>“Pisstake,” Agatha muttered, which made everyone laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m twenty-one now, which means <em> big<em>  party. Come if you dare.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Natty, don’t invite him, you wouldn’t want a rodent scurrying about the place,” Rio teased, earning her an elbow to the stomach.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey!” Rio said, slapping her brother on the arm.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. At the end of the day, the Vidal siblings were just that…siblings. Not the potential future King or Queen of Spain.<br/>
</p><p>“Thanks for the invite, Natasha, but I won’t come if Rio doesn’t want me there.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio groaned. “I guess you can come.”<br/>
</p><p>“Great! I’m coming.”<br/>
</p><p>“You were supposed to put up more of a fight,” Rio complained.<br/>
</p><p>“There’s not enough time in the world. Speaking of, we really have to go.”<br/>
</p><p>“Fucksake. Right, see you all later.” Rio kissed Agatha once, then came back for another.<br/>
</p><p>“You fucked your lipstick!” Agatha called as Rio and Carlos walked to the front door.<br/>
</p><p>“Like I said, sue a girl!” Rio called back.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“And wear a costume, it’s a costume party!” Natasha shouted as the door clicked shut.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha spun on her. “Coffee?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha replied. “Let me grab my phone.”<br/>
</p><p>“Alright, I’ll get Jen.”<br/>
</p><p>“No Alice?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nah, she’s at a lecture.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ah.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha jumped, looking up from her phone.<br/>
</p><p>“What?!”<br/>
</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes from across the table. “Stop stalking your girlfriend on social media and join in the conversation.”<br/>
</p><p>“I wasn’t stalking my girlfriend,” Agatha grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>She was actually trolling all the freak lesbians who were thirsting over her in her suit. Her timeline was flooded once again with an endless stream of photos of Rio.<br/>
</p><p>A win for Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>An absolute loss for Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t have enough thumbs.<br/>
</p><p>She was also glued to her phone just in case Rio called or texted.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt sick when she noticed the angry red indents in Rio’s palms, felt even sicker when Rio told her the things her mother would say to her. She’d somehow held her tongue, knowing it was more important to say the right words than condemn the queen of Spain to a life of eternal misery.<br/>
</p><p>“You were,” Natasha said, taking a sip of her iced latte. “You wanna put your phone down?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha flashed her a fake smile before doing so.<br/>
</p><p>“You guys ready for tonight?” Natasha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Very. Did you buy the Malibu?” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Yup.”<br/>
</p><p>“I owe you my left kidney. I’ll bank transfer you the money.”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha waved her off. “It’s fine. I’m the host, right? I should have <em> some<em>  drinks.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Jen and Agatha pulled a face.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s your birthday.”<br/>
</p><p>“Let her pay you back, Nat,” Jen and Agatha said at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>“Ah,” Natasha pointed a finger. “Technically, my birthday was in December, but you know, stupid exams, etc.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed. “I’ll buy you something in return.”<br/>
</p><p>“Thanks, Aggs.”<br/>
</p><p>“Who’s coming?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>“My course friends, hockey society, men’s and women’s,” Natasha tilted her head to think. “My sister-”<br/>
</p><p>“Yelena’s coming?!” Agatha hadn’t meant to squeal.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Natasha chuckled.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait,” Jen said, holding her hands out. “That means we're going to get <em> fucked<em> , but like, actually. Off our faces, hammered.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“That’s the plan, yes. It’s my fucking birthday!” Natasha reminded them.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha and Jen nodded their agreement.<br/>
</p><p>“And obviously you guys, Lucia, now the future king of Spain?”<br/>
</p><p>Jen furrowed her eyebrows. “Carlos is coming?”<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm.”<br/>
</p><p>“Interesting. I’ve wanted to meet him for ages.”<br/>
</p><p>“You have?” Agatha asked. “Why?”<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve never wanted to meet a future King?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “Fairs.”<br/>
</p><p>“But Lucia suggested that the kitchen is a no phone zone because, one, Carlos will be there, two, you and Rio won’t have to worry about anyone potentially recording you. You guys can’t keep your hands off each other whilst drunk, and I don’t want Rio being shipped off somewhere,” Natasha explained.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scrunched her face. “We can.”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha and Jen deadpanned.<br/>
</p><p>“We <em> can<em> .”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Anyway,” Jen said loudly. “What’s going on with you two?”<br/>
</p><p>“With who two?”<br/>
</p><p>This time, it was Agatha and Jen deadpanning.<br/>
</p><p>“Lucia, Nat,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Ohhh…I’m cooking.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen and Agatha glanced at each other.<br/>
</p><p>“Care to elaborate?” Jen pressed.<br/>
</p><p>“Nope.”<br/>
</p><p>“Why-”<br/>
</p><p>“Hola, chicas,” Alice greeted as she slid into the chair beside Jen.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey,” the girls replied in unison.<br/>
</p><p>“How’d you know where we were?” Jen asked when Alice pulled away from their kiss.<br/>
</p><p>That sinking feeling that always hit Agatha when she saw couples being PDA overcame her. She wasn’t jealous of her best friend, never. She just wished she and Rio could be as carefree as they were.<br/>
</p><p>“<em> Life 360<em> , my godsend.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Everyone laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s everyone’s costumes for later?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Not telling you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Nada,” Agatha and Natasha replied at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait and see,” Natasha winked.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The event, a charity fundraiser to raise money for some art museum Rio hadn’t bothered to catch the name of, had overrun.<br/>
</p><p>Her girlfriend was going to kill her.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha’s party started in half an hour, and Rio was just stepping out of the car outside her accommodation. Agatha was waiting outside, already in costume, foot tapping impatiently.<br/>
</p><p>Rio let her jaw drop.<br/>
</p><p>Her girlfriend looked fucking incredible.<br/>
</p><p>Her long hair was scrunched and messy in that camera-ready way; she’d done her makeup to look like soot and dirt in that pretty Hollywood way with a fake knife cut on her cheekbone. And she had on a white oversized button-up night shirt with red wellie boots.<br/>
</p><p>“You look-”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re late,” Agatha cut in, dragging Rio inside by her tie.<br/>
</p><p>Rio got dressed in Agatha’s room, putting on her white linen pyjama shorts set with a V-neck body-fitting cropped top and <em> Timberland<em>  boots. Her girlfriend started adding the fake blood and dirt.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You having fun there?” Rio asked when Agatha had spent an awfully long time on her abs.<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes looked up, then rolled.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m making sure people know who we are.”<br/>
</p><p>“We’re Mr and Mrs Smith…or Mrs and Mrs Harkness-Vidal,” Rio winked. “However you wanna put it. It’s easy.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes again, straightening up before adding more dirt smears to Rio’s clothes with her makeup brush.<br/>
</p><p>“I like that you’ve decided on the one shoulder,” Rio commented.<br/>
</p><p>“You only like it because you can see my bra,” Agatha scolded.<br/>
</p><p>“Precisely,” Rio mumbled against Agatha’s lips before she kissed her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio parted Agatha’s lips with her tongue as she pushed her girlfriend back, her body hitting the wall. Agatha lifted a leg, wrapping it around Rio’s waist, and Rio slid her hand underneath Agatha’s thigh to keep it there.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s hands raked desperately through Rio’s hair as they devoured each other, their tongues moving against one another frantically as if there wasn’t enough time in the world. That hand on Agatha’s thigh moved to grab at lace underwear and soft flesh. Agatha groaned, her back arching.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck, fuck,” Agatha got out. “I need you to-”<br/>
</p><p>A knock on the door.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you two ready?” Alice called.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw her head back with a groan.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha slapped her on the shoulder. “Why would you say that?” Agatha whispered.<br/>
</p><p>“Because we’ve got plenty of time later,” Rio grinned. “Let’s go.”<br/>
</p><p>“Your lip gloss is smudged,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>“So’s yours,” Rio grinned.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>To absolutely nobody’s surprise, the girls were fucked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blamed Yelena for her getting drunk five times faster than she usually would. Like on Halloween, Yelena was yelling shot o’clock every five minutes, and sometimes Natasha would force her to do a double because <em> it was her birthday.<br/>
</em></p><p>“Have I told you how good you look?” Agatha yelled over the noise. Natasha’s kitchen was packed, and her speakers were on full blast.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha twirled in her Jessica Rabbit costume. She stumbled into Sam, the other men’s hockey captain and Agatha and Yelena had to grab her to stop her from falling.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry, Wilson,” Agatha apologised.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re good,” he smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha giggled. “Thank you, Aggs. Yours and Rio’s costumes are so cunt.”<br/>
</p><p>“You mean Spanish princess who Agatha definitely didn’t match with on Halloween?” Yelena asked, adjusting her fox ears. “You’re matching again?”<br/>
</p><p>“I think it’s time for more shots!” Agatha announced.<br/>
</p><p>Yelena would never argue with that.<br/>
</p><p>Once Agatha had downed her apple sour shot, she went over to Jen in her mermaid costume who had been sitting next to the speaker for most of the night.<br/>
</p><p>“I come with presents,” Agatha said, handing her best friend a Malibu shot and a cup of rum and Coke.<br/>
</p><p>“I love you,” Jen replied as she took them. “Being a DJ is hard work.”<br/>
</p><p>“You know you can just let a playlist run.”<br/>
</p><p>“No!” Jen snapped, which made Agatha put her hand up in surrender. “Plus, there is only one phone in this entire room, and I have it. I don’t trust anyone else.”<br/>
</p><p>“Aw, Jenny! Are you trying to make sure me and Rio have a good night?”<br/>
</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“You are! Oh, you love me <em> bad<em> , huh?” Agatha teased.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Do one.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed, throwing her arms around her. “I don’t tell you this enough, but I love you, kay?” Agatha pulled back. “We’re not blood, but we might as well be.”<br/>
</p><p>Her best friend blinked before she turned away.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, you are <em> drunk<em> !” Agatha cackled. “Not you crying.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Jen swiped at her tears. “Why are you still here? Don’t you have a girlfriend to pester?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed again.<br/>
</p><p>“¡Mi hermana!” <em> Sister<em> . Carlos exclaimed, his cowboy hat askew as he walked up to Agatha, three drinks in hand.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Hola,” Agatha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos kissed her twice on the cheek before handing Agatha and Jen the drinks.<br/>
</p><p>“What is-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha choked, cutting her best friend off. “How much tequila did you put in this?”<br/>
</p><p>“Not a clue, but it’s my special. Fia helped,” Carlos grinned.<br/>
</p><p>“Spanish royalty are trying to kill us,” Jen said. “That’ll make a headline.”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos threw his head back and laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Alice came over then, she lifted her eyepatch off her eye before saying:<br/>
</p><p>“Baby, let me put on a song.”<br/>
</p><p>“Why?” Jen asked, shielding the phone.<br/>
</p><p>“Me and Ri are working on a plan for Nat and Cia.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen gave the phone to her girlfriend.<br/>
</p><p>“That still hasn’t happened yet? I thought Rio gave Lucia the green light,” Carlos said.<br/>
</p><p>“She did,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Nat’s been too busy hosting to actually do anything,” Alice told them.<br/>
</p><p>
<em> Tití me preguntó by Bad Bunny<em> , started playing.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“¡Ayyyy!” Carlos exclaimed. “¡Vamos, Ali!”<br/>
</p><p>Alice laughed as she dragged her girlfriend to the dance floor.<br/>
</p><p>“¡Vamos, Aggs!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned as Carlos nudged her.<br/>
</p><p>“¡Mi novia!” <em> My girlfriend!<em>  Rio screamed when she saw Agatha, flinging her arms around her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Alice pulled Natasha and Lucia into the crowd.<br/>
</p><p>Body’s started moving, the lights from Natasha’s disco lights started flashing, and Agatha yelped when Rio grabbed her hand and spun her. She slammed into her girlfriend, who spun her again, let go of her, and made her crash into Carlos.<br/>
</p><p>“Lo siento,” Agatha apologised.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Qué?” <em> What?<em>  Carlos laughed before he too, grabbed her hand and spun her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The Vidal siblings were trying to kill her. Agatha felt nauseous.<br/>
</p><p>She fell into Rio again, who stopped her from falling.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Estás bien, bebé?” <em> You okay, baby?<br/>
</em></p><p>“¡No!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio cackled before she lifted Agatha’s arms and started bouncing them in time with the music.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos started pointing at them, and Agatha, her girlfriend, and her brother started bouncing to the music.<br/>
</p><p>
<em> “Vamo a tirarno un sefi, say ‘cheese.’”<em>  The song said.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“Say cheese!” Alice yelled as she waved her camcorder in their faces.<br/>
</p><p>They did.<br/>
</p><p>
<em> “Me gustan mucho las Gabriela’, las Patracia’, Las Nicole’, las Sofia’.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“¡Las Sofia!” Every Spanish person in the room yelled and pointed at Rio, who bowed.<br/>
</p><p>“¡Mi princesa!” Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio grinned and kissed her cheek.<br/>
</p><p>“Nooo,” Carlos scolded teasingly.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shoved him<br/>
</p><p>“Ali,” Agatha said, beckoning for the camera.<br/>
</p><p>Alice gave it to her, and Agatha danced over to Lucia and Natasha with their arms around each other. Natasha was closing the distance, was kissing her.<br/>
</p><p>“¡Ayyyyy!” Everyone screamed.<br/>
</p><p>Neither girl noticed, getting lost in the kiss.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha panned the camera to Steve two heads away.<br/>
</p><p>“Esh,” Agatha mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>To say he looked upset would be an understatement. The poor fucker had had a crush on Natasha all year.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned again, filming Kate and Yelena dancing.<br/>
</p><p>“Come on, Aggs!” Kate beckoned.<br/>
</p><p>She shimmed over to them, jumping as they were.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha fucking loved this. The dizzying, giddy feeling that came with being happy and drunk.<br/>
</p><p>“You guys have to come to Manny,” Yelena said over the noise. “You lot would love it there.”<br/>
</p><p>“Agreed,” Kate nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t worry, we’re coming,” Agatha smiled. “You better have enough space for us.”<br/>
</p><p>“Space…no. But we won’t be sleeping anyway,” Yelena laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Hands grabbed Agatha’s waist, and she leaned back into her girlfriend’s body.<br/>
</p><p>Alice swooped in and took her camcorder back. “I don’t want you two breaking it.”<br/>
</p><p>“Why would we-”<br/>
</p><p>She got cut off when Rio picked her up and twirled her.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s why,” Alice cackled.<br/>
</p><p>
<em> “Tití me preguntó-to-to-to-to-to-to”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio put her down and flung her arms around Agatha’s neck.<br/>
</p><p>“Nuh uh,” Agatha grinned, twisting Rio.<br/>
</p><p>Her girlfriend knew exactly what she meant, letting Agatha step in front of her before Agatha started grinding on Rio. Rio’s left hand came to rest on her waist, and Agatha snaked hers up to grip Rio’s neck. She felt her girlfriend move in time with her, felt that rush of wetness leak from her core.<br/>
</p><p>
<em> Fuckkkk.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha was going to come untouched.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s free hand trailed up her body to grab one of her tits.<br/>
</p><p>
<em> Double fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha was gone.<br/>
</p><p>She bit her lip to get a hold of herself. She leaned into Rio, resting her head in the crook of her neck.<br/>
</p><p>“You feel so fucking good, baby,” Rio murmured into her ear as her hips shifted.<br/>
</p><p>And Agatha was fucking gone again.<br/>
</p><p>“So do – <em> hm<em> ,” when Rio squeezed again. “So do you,” Agatha got out breathlessly. Agatha turned. “We gotta go home.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Already?” Rio laughed. She stopped when she took in the desperation in Agatha’s eyes. “Tell you what, we’ll go, fuck, and then come back?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, that,” Agatha said as she pulled Rio out of the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>They never went back.</p>

<p>Agatha blinked awake. Her brain felt fuzzy, and she knew she was going to have the hangover of her life.<br/>
</p><p>What time was it?<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t know.<br/>
</p><p>She sat up to see Rio passed out, her mouth slightly open, streaks of dried mascara on her cheeks from the multiple rounds of fucking they did last night. Agatha chuckled lightly before moving her wrists to find they were still sore from the handcuffs. She sighed, placing her head in its rightful position on Rio’s chest.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled when she heard Rio’s heartbeat thudding against her ear. It was always her favourite sound to wake up to. She cherished the mornings she got to listen to it; the proof that Rio hadn’t left to attend some royal event.<br/>
</p><p>And Agatha genuinely couldn’t help it. She tilted her head to gaze at Rio again. Her princess always looked so peaceful in sleep. All the worries that plague her at every minute of every day, vanishing with unconsciousness.<br/>
</p><p>“You wanna quit staring at me?” Rio mumbled into her hair a good while later.<br/>
</p><p>“What?”<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve been staring at me for the past twenty minutes.”<br/>
</p><p>“Have not,” Agatha countered.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Thought we promised to stop lying to each other.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pushed at Rio’s face, earning her a giggle in response.<br/>
</p><p>“They’re your words,” Rio grinned. “What? You can’t follow your own instructions?”<br/>
</p><p>“Have I ever told you I hate you?”<br/>
</p><p>“Many a times, yes,” her grin unwavering.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, sitting up to reach for and tug on Rio’s dark grey <em>Carhartt<em> hoodie.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You have access to my entire wardrobe now, and yet that hoodie is always your go-to,” Rio stated.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “It’s the first thing of yours you ever gave me,” she shrugged again. “Means something.”<br/>
</p><p>Her girlfriend didn’t say anything, the rustling of Agatha fixing the jumper being the only sound before Rio replied:<br/>
</p><p>“You sure you hate me?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned, and that look in Rio’s eyes made her want to melt.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was so in love with her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>SHUT THE FUCK UP!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Yup.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed. “Give me back my hoodie then.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’d have to take it off my corpse.”<br/>
</p><p>“Drama queen,” Rio teased, getting up and planting a kiss on Agatha’s cheek.<br/>
</p><p>She walked to Agatha’s drawer underneath her photo board in her Spider-Man boxers, opened it and pulled on one of Agatha’s (Rio’s) hoodies.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha watched as Rio scanned the photos above her.<br/>
</p><p>“I have a shrine.”<br/>
</p><p>“You what?”<br/>
</p><p>“A shrine,” Rio repeated, turning with a grin.<br/>
</p><p>“Look, there’s me,” she pointed to a picture of her and Agatha cuddling in bed. “And me,” she pointed to a picture of them sitting on the edge of a pavement, drunk, with cigarettes hanging out of their mouths. “And oh look,” Rio nodded to a strip of photobooth photos. The first one was them giving the camera the finger, the second, Rio had pissed Agatha off, and Rio was grinning, Agatha scowling. The third, Rio grabbing a pissed off Agatha’s face, drawing her in. The last, Rio kissing Agatha mid laugh, the scowl clean off her face. “Me again.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw her hands out in a ‘What’s your point?’<br/>
</p><p>“I’m in almost every photo; therefore, this is my shrine.”<br/>
</p><p>“Can you shut up?”<br/>
</p><p>“Never.” She smiled that stupid smile that always had Agatha fighting off her own.<br/>
</p><p>Her girlfriend huffed. “I want salsa.”<br/>
</p><p>“Pardon?”<br/>
</p><p>“Salsa and tortilla chips,” Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s what your hungover ass wants at,” Agatha checked her phone. “Ten in the morning?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Rio frowned. “My Abuela’s recipe too. Do we have the ingredients?”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t know, baby. You’ll have to-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio was marching to the door before she could finish.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw her hands up yet again as it swung open.<br/>
</p><p>“Carlos, what the fuck?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows, got up…<br/>
</p><p>Carlos was sprawled out in the corridor, cowboy costume still on.<br/>
</p><p>He stirred. “Oh. Hi, Fia. Hi, Aggs.”<br/>
</p><p>The girlfriends glanced at each other before returning their gaze to Carlos.<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck are you doing on the floor?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Sleeping,” Carlos mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“Why didn’t you go back to your hotel?”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos waved his hand around. “It was <em>so<em> far.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha snorted, and Rio kicked him so he’d stop blocking their exit.<br/>
</p><p>“Fia!” Carlos groaned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio ignored him. “I’m making Abuela’s salsa and you’re helping.”<br/>
</p><p>“Fine.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio took Agatha’s hand and dragged her into the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>She scanned through the cupboards and drawers, closing them with a bang that made Agatha and Carlos wince as they sat around the island with a tub of pineapple.<br/>
</p><p>Rio folded her arms. “I’m gonna have to go to the supermarket.” She walked over to Agatha who popped a pineapple piece into her girlfriend’s mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“So you’re obsessed with pineapples too, huh?” Carlos asked.<br/>
</p><p>“What do you mean?” Agatha said around her mouthful.<br/>
</p><p>“When Rio was home for the holidays, she wouldn’t stop eating pineapple, and what was the other thing?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Cranberry juice?”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos snapped his fingers. “That was it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s ears turned pink. “I like the taste! It’s sweet,” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, I’m well aware.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio slapped her on the shoulder, and Agatha cackled.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos furrowed his eyebrows. “What’s so funny?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing.”<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing!” Rio and Agatha said together.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to the supermarket,” Rio repeated.<br/>
</p><p>“Now?” Carlos startled.<br/>
</p><p>“But baby, we <em>just<em> woke up,” Agatha whined.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You don’t have to come, I just need to get a couple of things,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Then I’ll feel bad,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>“Then feel bad,” Rio winked, dipping down to kiss Agatha’s cheek. “I’m gonna shower and change. Where’s Cia?”<br/>
</p><p>“At Natasha’s,” Carlos yawned.<br/>
</p><p>“Course. Okay, you’re coming with me.”<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Carlos protested.<br/>
</p><p>“Lucia’s busy. If I go out with you, your security guard comes with us and mother won’t be on my ass about leaving the flat by myself,” Rio said boredly.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos huffed, getting out of his seat.<br/>
</p><p>"See you later, mi amor.”<br/>
</p><p>“Bye,” Agatha replied, stretching. She really did need to go back to sleep.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>It was around 4 PM when Agatha left her room. She’d slept for most of the day, the night of fucking taking a much bigger toll on her than she’d previously thought. She was sure she would’ve fallen asleep again after her shower if it weren’t for the laughter coming from the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>When she entered, her friends and Carlos were sitting around the island eating Rio’s homemade salsa.<br/>
</p><p>“Glad to see you lot were thinking of me,” Agatha said, announcing her presence.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, sleepy head,” Rio said, getting up and pulling out a chair for her. “I went into your room four times today, and each time I did, you were asleep.”<br/>
</p><p>“I second that,” Jen said. “When I knocked, I got no reply.”<br/>
</p><p>“And you didn’t think to wake me?” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Nope.”<br/>
</p><p>“No, baby. Why would we wake you if you obviously needed the rest?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Salsa?” Jen offered. “It’s really good.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glared at her, and her best friend laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Make sure you give her the right one,” Carlos said from across the table in his seat next to Lucia.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“There’s spicy and a non-spicy.”<br/>
</p><p>“Why?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Because Rio knows you can’t handle spice and made a mild one just for you!” Jen replied with mock enthusiasm.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stared Rio down, and she bit her lip.<br/>
</p><p>She threw her hands up. “How many times do I have to say this? I can handle fucking spice!” Agatha yelled.<br/>
</p><p>All conversations halted, the room falling silent until Natasha snorted. Soon after, everyone was laughing, smacking the table and almost falling off chairs because of how hard they were cackling.<br/>
</p><p>“I hate you all,” Agatha sulked.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs, we love you,” Alice said through a chuckle.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re just taking the piss,” Natasha chimed.<br/>
</p><p>“You should be taking this as a compliment, you’ve made us all laugh,” Jen added.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha flipped her off, which only made Jen laugh again.<br/>
</p><p>“Ignore them,” Rio grinned, holding out a tortilla chip with salsa. Agatha leaned in and took it in her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re not off the hook,” Agatha said, covering her mouth as she ate. “Your-” Agatha coughed, the salsa tickling her throat.<br/>
</p><p>And right on cue…<br/>
</p><p>The group burst out laughing.<br/>
</p><p>“I am so sorry, baby,” Rio handed her a glass of water. “I thought I gave you the right one.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha swiped the glass from her girlfriend’s hand and downed it in one gulp.<br/>
</p><p>“So I’m guessing this isn’t the right time for me to show you guys what I found on Twitter earlier,” Alice said, eyeing Agatha with concern.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha waved her off. “Talk, Al. Anything to get you dickheads to stop staring at me.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice nodded with a smile, scrolling through her Twitter.<br/>
</p><p>A beat passed before Alice said:<br/>
</p><p>“Wait, sorry, I thought I saved it.”<br/>
</p><p>“What was it about?” Lucia asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Our group has made it onto Rio-Sofia stan Twitter.”<br/>
</p><p>“What?!” Jen shrieked. “What do you mean?”<br/>
</p><p>“I mean, we’ve been papped, babe.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re fucking with me,” Natasha said, leaning in to look at Alice’s phone.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned to Rio, who had a nervous expression on her face. She nudged her, and Rio shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck is that?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha snatched Alice’s phone out of her hand.<br/>
</p><p>“What the hell?”<br/>
</p><p>“What – oh…” Carlos trailed off when he’d seen.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia and her bodyguard definitely did it,” Natasha read.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shot up, leaned across the table and yanked the phone from Natasha.<br/>
</p><p>A picture of Rio arriving at an event with Lucia holding an umbrella for her shone back at her.<br/>
</p><p>Lucia raised an eyebrow. “Are people seriously shipping us?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio leaned in, her eyes scanning over the many comments under the post that agreed. “Seems like it,” she laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio <em>laughed<em> as if anything was funny.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I don’t know how to process this information,” Lucia’s laugh joined Rio’s.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glared at her girlfriend who was too busy laughing with Lucia to notice. Agatha’s eyes snapped to Natasha’s, her expression mirroring hers. It was as if they shared the same brain cell. They nodded simultaneously before Natasha grabbed Lucia and Agatha, Rio.<br/>
</p><p>They left the kitchen, Natasha pulling Lucia out of the flat and Agatha pulling Rio into her room. She let the door slam, locked it.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Rio bit out.<br/>
</p><p>“You thought that was funny?” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>She shouldn’t have been surprised when a slow smirk spread across Rio’s lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah?” But her voice was smooth like honey, taunting, tempting. “What? You didn’t, baby? The world thinks I’m fucking my security guard. Funniest thing I ever heard.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was looking up into dark brown eyes; she didn’t say anything. Let her glare burn holes into Rio’s eye sockets.<br/>
</p><p>The silence was tense, the only thing making noise being Rio. Her girlfriend’s breath kept hitching in anticipation. Her pupils slowly but surely dilating.<br/>
</p><p>“Strip,” Agatha ordered almost five minutes later.<br/>
</p><p>That smirk was back again.<br/>
</p><p>“Make m-”<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Make me<em>,” Agatha mimicked. “I’ll touch myself and force you to watch. You want that?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Will you handcuff me if you do?” Rio asked, biting her lip.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” Agatha nodded. She stepped closer. “I’ll make myself come over and over, and all you’ll be able to do is watch. I’ll get off to your desperate whimpers, your begging.” Agatha rasped in her ear, pushing Rio backwards. “And sure, you’ll think it’s fun…the first time. What happens when it’s me who’s the whimpering mess, knowing you had no hand in it?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s smirk dropped.<br/>
</p><p>“You still want that, darlin?”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio replied petulantly.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Didn’t fucking think so. Strip.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes before pushing off her sweatpants and pulling off her jumper, leaving her in her <em>Calvin Klein<em> boxers.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“In your own time,” Agatha yawned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed before she tugged her underwear off.<br/>
</p><p>“Thought you’d want to rip them off me,” Rio commented.<br/>
</p><p>“Nah,” Agatha said, stepping in front of her.<br/>
</p><p>Her breath hitched as it almost always did when she gazed at Rio’s naked body. The only thing she had on now was her silver jewellery: the stacks of earrings, the ‘A’ necklace, the diamond belly button piercing.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Her princess was perfect.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “You’ve gotta work for everything tonight.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow.<br/>
</p><p>“Undress me,” Agatha commanded.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, Miss Harkness,” Rio husked in her ear before she lifted Agatha’s arms and rid her of her hoodie.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha hadn’t even asked her to do this.<br/>
</p><p>Rio got on her knees, bare skin on cool wooden floor. Agatha saw the goosebumps travel up Rio’s arms as she slowly pulled down Agatha sweatpants. She raised each of Agatha's feet out of her clothing, leaving her in her lace underwear.<br/>
</p><p>Brown eyes, almost black, looked up.<br/>
</p><p>“Anything else, princesa?”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuckkkk.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio was going to ruin everything. She was being somewhat obedient, which she never fucking was during sex <em>and<em> she was on her knees calling Agatha ‘Princesa.’<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha almost forgot why she was mad at her…<br/>
</p><p>Almost.<br/>
</p><p>Rio reached to take off her underwear, and Agatha stepped back.<br/>
</p><p>“I got it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio jerked her head. “Why?”<br/>
</p><p>“You can’t touch yet.”<br/>
</p><p>“But you're mine,” Rio snapped, her head nodding to the panties where <em>‘Rio-Sofia’s cunt’<em> was sewn in small lavender purple across the front.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“And you're mine,” Agatha countered easily. “Yet you think it’s funny when people think you’re fucking your head of security.”<br/>
</p><p>That fucking smirk was back on Rio’s face.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s driving you insane, isn’t it?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nope. Only you are. Up.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared at her, her tongue poking her cheek.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stared back.<br/>
</p><p>Waited…<br/>
</p><p>Waited some more…<br/>
</p><p>“Are your ears not working?” Agatha seethed.<br/>
</p><p>“They’re working perfectly fine, actually,” came the simple reply.<br/>
</p><p>“Then why aren’t you-”<br/>
</p><p>“Why would I listen to you if you won’t let me touch you?” Rio stated.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes because of fucking course her princess would revert to being a brat the second she didn’t get what she wanted.<br/>
</p><p>She scoffed, walking over to her top drawer to retrieve their handcuffs. Rio practically drooled at the sight of them. Agatha dropped them in her lap.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t make me have to say it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her tongue around her bottom teeth before she cuffed her right hand.<br/>
</p><p>She shrugged. “Can’t do the other one.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head with narrowed eyes. “Get up, and I’ll do it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shot up like a rocket.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed again because of fucking course. She’d played right into her girlfriend’s hands. She wanted this.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha used the free cuff to spin Rio around, locking her hands behind her back.<br/>
</p><p>“There. Turn.”<br/>
</p><p>When Rio did, there was a look in her eye that Agatha could only describe as desperate. A slow smirk began to form. Oh, the power. To know that someone who could be the Head of State of an entire nation was bound at the hands of her, trusted her enough to allow her to do so…<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt like a God.<br/>
</p><p>The power Rio held gone and given straight to Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>She nodded to the bed. “Sit.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t take her eyes off her as she sat at the edge of it.<br/>
</p><p>“Spread your legs.”<br/>
</p><p>Again, the eye contact was unwavering as the princess followed Agatha’s orders, her chest rising and falling rapidly in anticipation.<br/>
</p><p>“Good boy,” Agatha said as she dropped to her knees, hooking Rio’s legs around her shoulders.<br/>
</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “This doesn’t feel like a punishment.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked up at her through her eyelashes. “No? You still can’t touch me. Like you <em>literally<em> cannot touch me.” Agatha’s gaze shifted to Rio’s hands locked behind her back.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio’s face dropped.<br/>
</p><p>“You remember the safe word?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. “Lavender.”<br/>
</p><p>“Good. You move or make any snarky remarks, I stop,” Agatha continued.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“You roll your eyes or pull any faces, I stop.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s face twitched as if she wanted to do so before she steeled herself.<br/>
</p><p>“Would you look at that,” Agatha cooed, running a hand down Rio’s face that she pulled away from. “You <em>can<em> listen.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio’s lips parted, probably to snap at her until she remembered the rules. Instead, she stuck her tongue out.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to let that one slide because you’ve actually shut up.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned her attention to her princess’s dripping cunt.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, my love, you’re soaked. Pathetic, don’t you think considering I haven’t even touched you yet?” Agatha taunted.<br/>
</p><p>She blew a cool stream of air directly on Rio’s clit, making her jolt.<br/>
</p><p>“Ah,” Agatha tutted. “What’d I say?”<br/>
</p><p>“You-” Rio cut herself off, pressing her lips into a thin line.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned before she pressed a dirty kiss to a heated thigh, her eyes locking onto the needy ones above.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m the only one who has ever touched you like this.” Another kiss. “The only one who ever will.” Another.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was trembling now, biting down on her bottom lip out of desperation? Frustration? Probably both.<br/>
</p><p>She nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“So it doesn’t matter who people think their princess is fucking because you’ll only <em>ever<em> be fucking me.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio nodded again.<br/>
</p><p>“Spain’s princess, mine first.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yours only,” came the swift reply.<br/>
</p><p>And she wasn’t supposed to speak, but Agatha would always let Rio vocalise her devotion to her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned and, without warning, swept her tongue through Rio’s wetness, purposely grazing her clit without applying any pressure as she did so.<br/>
</p><p>Rio jolted once more, and Agatha pulled away.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, come on,” Rio groaned. “I didn’t fucking mean to…I mean how do you expect me to…?” She snapped her lips shut.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head playfully before readjusting and darting her tongue back in. She revealed in Rio’s taste, her wetness, the coarse hairs that tickled her skin.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, god.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio was so fucking perfect and most importantly, perfect for Agatha and Agatha alone.<br/>
</p><p>She couldn’t help the moan when Rio twitched, her cunt pressing further into Agatha’s face.<br/>
</p><p>She realised she’d happily die like this; her head wedged between Rio-Sofia’s thighs as she lapped up her slick.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha put her hand underneath her chin and pushed two fingers inside, moving in tandem with her tongue. And the sounds Rio was making. Those desperate little whimpers that made Agatha’s eyes roll into the back of her head and her core clench around nothing.<br/>
</p><p>Power.<br/>
</p><p>So fucking much of it, radiating off her as she fucked her princess, making her a mess under her fingers and tongue.<br/>
</p><p>She could feel Rio tensing against her restraints, the urge to touch Agatha so strong that the trembling from before had ramped up significantly. Her girlfriend’s thighs shook around her head, the evidence that she was shattering, that the princess of Spain was falling from grace with Agatha there to catch her.<br/>
</p><p>Power. In every sense of the fucking word.<br/>
</p><p>A gasp when Agatha started circling Rio’s clit with her tongue and curled her fingers. Another when Agatha sped up both. Rio shifted her hips, forcing her cunt into Agatha’s face even more if that were possible. Agatha felt her nose press into her girlfriend’s folds, felt Rio twitch when she did so.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you regretting making me shut up now? Just think of all the praise I could be telling you, baby. Let me say it.”<br/>
</p><p>And Agatha couldn’t argue with that. Her stupid fucking praise kink always ruined her plans.<br/>
</p><p>She waved her free hand, and right on cue…<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Fuck!<em>” Rio groaned. “You make me feel so good, princessa.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>Stupid fucking praise kink.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>When Agatha felt the new wetness of her underwear.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re the only person who’s ever had access to me like this.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Stupid fucking corruption kink.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She’d taken of all people the bloody princess of Spain’s virginity, and if that wasn’t already turning her on, the fact that she knew Rio genuinely wouldn’t let anyone else have her the way Agatha had was the cherry on top of the cake.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled her mouth from Rio’s cunt but kept her fingers pumping. The need to kiss Rio overcoming her. Agatha got up on her knees and snaked her free hand up Rio’s neck, dragging her forward to plant a filthy kiss on her princess’s lips.<br/>
</p><p>She felt Rio’s shoulders bounce as if she'd tried to move to touch Agatha when she remembered she was bound. Her body deflated, a pathetic whine escaping her lips and into Agatha’s mouth.<br/>
</p><p>Those whines didn’t stop as Agatha hit her clit with every pump, swallowing the sounds like she was guzzling water, like this was her only means of survival.<br/>
</p><p>Maybe Rio was.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s core clench around her fingers, felt her tilt her head back to let out a loud moan as she came.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha could only grin, satisfied once again that the potential future queen of Spain was hers. That only <em>she<em> would be able to hear the delicious sounds her princess was making.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“That’s a good girl,” Agatha praised, her grin unwavering.<br/>
</p><p>She pushed Rio’s damp hair out of her eyes as her fingers kept pumping to ride out Rio’s orgasm.<br/>
</p><p>When it had passed, Agatha carefully extracted them.<br/>
</p><p>“My turn?” Rio got out through shallow breaths.<br/>
</p><p>“Your turn, but we’re trying something new.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s body came alive again, twitching at the mere thought.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll be back in a sec.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha headed to the bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio could barely breathe.<br/>
</p><p>She felt lightheaded, her cunt sensitive, her wrists sore from tensing against her restraints…<br/>
</p><p>She was on cloud fucking nine…eight.<br/>
</p><p>Rio deducted a point because she’d been in agony staring down at the only girl who would ever matter without running her hands through her gorgeous hair.<br/>
</p><p>She’d wanted this, the handcuffs, but fuck, if she could somehow touch Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s bathroom door creaked.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck. Me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha in a harness, a dark green strap protruding from her body.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s mouth dried out as she blinked rapidly.<br/>
</p><p>Rio-Sofia Vidal was getting fucking strapped.<br/>
</p><p>“You like?” Agatha asked as she ran her hand down the five and a half inches.<br/>
</p><p>Rio could only nod.<br/>
</p><p>Her girlfriend came closer, continuing her strokes along the shaft.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s core clenched around nothing as if it hadn’t found its release mere moments ago.<br/>
</p><p>She moved her arm to touch, but it resisted against the metal cuffs.<br/>
</p><p>“Uncuff me,” Rio demanded. “I need to-”<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Agatha smiled, her hand still moving, taunting. “Thought you wanted the handcuffs.”<br/>
</p><p>“That was before-”<br/>
</p><p>“Before I brought my dick out?” Agatha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio glared at her.<br/>
</p><p>“I will.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio let out a sigh of relief.<br/>
</p><p>“Just not yet.”<br/>
</p><p>“W-what?!” Rio spluttered. “But I <em>need<em> to touch.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You can.” It was all Agatha said as she waited for Rio to put the pieces together.<br/>
</p><p>She furrowed her eyebrows, her brain churning when…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>And Rio’s mouth dried out all over again.<br/>
</p><p>“Can I?”<br/>
</p><p>“I would like to think so, yes,” Agatha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>No fucking thoughts.<br/>
</p><p>Rio got off the bed, sinking to her knees. Her mouth watered as she looked at the strap, then at Agatha above.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was so fucking attractive. Rio knew she would come if she kept staring at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Say the safe word or stop if it gets too much, okay?” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>She might as well have been talking to a brick wall; Rio’s gaze had returned to the strap.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warned, lifting her chin. “Safe word or stop if it gets too much.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said dismissively.<br/>
</p><p>She was done with looking, hungry for her lips to be around silicone.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you listening to-”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes!” Rio snapped. “I’ll stop.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio wouldn’t be stopping.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m just making…” Agatha trailed off, her expression softening. “Would you like me to uncuff you?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled a face. “Fuck no.”<br/>
</p><p>“Baby, I’m just checking. You’ve never-”<br/>
</p><p>“And I still haven’t,” Rio snapped. “I’m fine, I’m ready, I <em>want<em> this.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha held her gaze for a moment, looking for any signs that Rio was unsure. When she didn’t find any, her grin returned. “Okay then.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled on Rio’s jaw, encouraging her to part her lips before she gently slid the tip in.<br/>
</p><p>Rio saw fucking stars as her mouth filled.<br/>
</p><p>Wasn’t enough.<br/>
</p><p>She needed more.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shuffled closer, taking more of Agatha’s cock.<br/>
</p><p>“Careful,” Agatha warned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t give a flying fuck. If she could take the strap in one go, she would.<br/>
</p><p>She pressed her tongue flat against silicone, running her tongue up to the tip before she closed her mouth around it and pressed her head forward.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha moaning had her eyes snapping up. Her girlfriend’s head was thrown back, her bottom lip between her teeth as Rio’s movements caused the friction pad to rub against her clit.<br/>
</p><p>She needed Agatha to look at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Look at me,” Rio ordered around Agatha’s dick.<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes peeled open, and Rio grinned before she continued to take more of her.<br/>
</p><p>“Put your hand in my hair,” Rio instructed because Agatha was being sweet with her.<br/>
</p><p>Sure, she’d never done this before, but Rio knew what she wanted.<br/>
</p><p>Sweetness wasn’t it.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s fingers threaded through Rio’s locks, and Rio hummed when they tightened and pushed her forward. Her head started bobbing, back and forth, back and forth, each time taking more of Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Was there a better feeling than this?<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t think so.<br/>
</p><p>She spluttered when the tip hit the back of her throat.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” Agatha apologised, pulling out. “I didn’t mean-”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio mumbled, shuffling forward again.<br/>
</p><p>She knew she was drooling when her saliva started trickling down her chin, not that she cared. Rio was gone, enveloped in it all. The rhyme, the blue eyes in her glassy vision, Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha in her entirety as she looked down at Rio with aching need.<br/>
</p><p>It only drove Rio on.<br/>
</p><p>The hand in her hair tightened, and Rio groaned at the sensation, her cunt clenching around nothing as she squeezed her thighs together.<br/>
</p><p>She gaged again when the tip grazed her throat, and that’s what did it.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck!”<br/>
</p><p>As her body shuddered, come trickling down her thighs.<br/>
</p><p>Rio let the strap slip out of her mouth, and the grin she flashed Agatha was nothing short of menacing.<br/>
</p><p>She leaned forward, greedily flattening her tongue to clean the mess she’d made. The eye contact was unwavering as those unshed tears in her eyes fell. Agatha moved to wipe them, jolted when Rio switched to polish off the other thigh.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha sucked in a short breath when she pulled her hand away. And although Rio’s joints were stiff from kneeling on hardwood, she got up without assistance, towering over her girlfriend. The wet strap pressed against her entrance, and the only thing Rio had to say was:<br/>
</p><p>“Baby, I need your dick in me.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded, biting her lip, her breath jagged as she moved to grab the keys for the handcuffs.<br/>
</p><p>Once Rio’s hands were free, she rolled her shoulders in preparation for what was to come, waiting patiently (not) as Agatha coated the strap in lube. Agatha lay down on the bed.<br/>
</p><p>“Come on then,” Agatha beckoned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t need to be told twice, jumping onto the mattress for the next set of instructions.<br/>
</p><p>“Hop on,” Agatha winked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shuffled up Agatha’s legs just short of the strap. She breathed in before rising to her knees, her girlfriend positioning her dick just shy of her entrance.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay?” When Rio started sinking.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” came the reply.<br/>
</p><p>She was laser-focused as her cunt spread to accommodate.<br/>
</p><p>“Jesus.”<br/>
</p><p>Because Rio had never felt so full in her life. She felt like she was being split open, and yes, it hurt a little, but…<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck me.”<br/>
</p><p>Did it feel good.<br/>
</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath when she swallowed it all, her clit rubbing against the belt.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay, baby?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. “I just…give me a sec.”<br/>
</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha replied. “We won’t do anything until you’re ready, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded again, letting her body adjust to the new fullness. She felt Agatha’s gaze on her as she did so.<br/>
</p><p>When they locked eyes, a slow smile spread across her girlfriend’s lips, and as always, Rio couldn’t help the one that followed.<br/>
</p><p>“I look good?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve told you, you always look good.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “So do you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Tell me something I don’t know.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smacked her lightly on the arm, and Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“I think I’m ready.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s hands slid to grip Rio’s waist. “You sure?”<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Go on then, pretty girl.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio leaned forward, placing her hands on Agatha’s chest before she shifted her hips, lifting herself slightly before coming down.<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked. “<em>Fuck me.<em>”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The fullness she wasn’t quite used to yet, but that friction from her first movements…yeah, she needed more of that.<br/>
</p><p>She did it again, lifting herself before rolling her hips. Agatha helped, letting her hands move with Rio’s body.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re doing so well, baby,” Agatha encouraged as they continued.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled before the hands on Agatha’s breasts started squeezing, and those fucking sounds that filled her ears in response had her walls contracting.<br/>
</p><p>She hummed. This felt far too good.<br/>
</p><p>The cold chain of her ‘A’ necklace kept hitting heated skin every time she bounced, and she watched as Agatha eyed it. And the smirk that flew onto her face when the idea formed. Rio leaned further forward, and it was as if their brains were one. Agatha pulled the ‘A’ pendant into her mouth, curling her tongue around it the same time Rio pulled back, the chain pulling taut, digging into her neck.<br/>
</p><p>And fuck if Rio could catch the gasp that escaped her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned, the pendant hidden behind her tongue as the tip of it pressed into the back of her front teeth, the chain coming out from either side.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Good, god.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio was gone.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re so hot,” Rio got out as she rode the strap.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha let the pendant slip out of her mouth. It was coated in her saliva, dripping down the valley between her breasts before it hit Rio’s chest, warm saliva on even warmer skin.<br/>
</p><p>And if Rio wasn’t a slut for her girlfriend’s saliva.<br/>
</p><p>She licked the excess off Agatha’s chin whilst simultaneously pinching her hard nipples. The shudder from her girl beneath her was almost immediate, her hips bucking.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Fu-ck<em>,” Rio breathed.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Sorry, baby. I didn’t-”<br/>
</p><p>“Shut up and do that again,” Rio cut in.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed but did so.<br/>
</p><p>Rio threw her head back as she bounced, Agatha’s hands rolling her hips, Agatha’s hips fucking into her.<br/>
</p><p>“Faster,” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you sure-”<br/>
</p><p>“Now whose ears aren’t working? I said <em>faster<em>.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Fucking brat,” Agatha muttered before she picked up her pace.<br/>
</p><p>“Jesus.” It was all Rio could think of to say as her orgasm built.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I’d give her everything I have.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The thought slammed into her mind out of nowhere.<br/>
</p><p>Maybe it was the sex haze, maybe it was because she was riding Agatha’s dick, maybe it was because this was surrender.<br/>
</p><p>Surrender. In every sense of the fucking word.<br/>
</p><p>Because wasn’t this? Yes, Agatha had taken everything she possibly could from Rio in a sexual sense, Rio handing it over willingly, but it was <em>more.<em> It was their relationship as a whole because Rio would lose it all without hesitation. The power that came with being a princess, Spain’s approval, her parents, all for the sake of staying with Agatha.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Princess Rio-Sofia would fall from grace with Agatha there to catch her.<br/>
</p><p>And she would fall happily.<br/>
</p><p>“Shit, darlin, I’m gonna come.”<br/>
</p><p>“Me…too,” Rio panted.<br/>
</p><p>As soon as she said it…<br/>
</p><p>Their moans filled the room, Agatha’s head falling back as Rio’s walls fluttered around her cock.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck me,” Agatha gasped.<br/>
</p><p>“Mierda.” <em>Shit.<br/>
</em></p><p>When their movements slowed. Rio flopped onto Agatha’s sweaty chest, her body twitching whenever her cunt pulsed from the after waves.<br/>
</p><p>She smiled into Agatha’s skin, her girlfriend running her fingers through damp hair.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay, love?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio lifted her head. “Bloody brilliant.” Which earned her a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>They gazed at each other a moment, taking one another in, Agatha’s hand never stilling.<br/>
</p><p>“Bebe-”<br/>
</p><p>“You wanna go again?” Agatha cut in when enough silence had passed.<br/>
</p><p>And that smile returned because her girlfriend knew her all too well.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, and Agatha planted a kiss on her lips.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>First year was flying by.<br/>
</p><p>One minute it was January, the next it was February and now it was the end of March. Between hockey practice, classes, and royal events, Rio felt like the weeks merged into one. She never had a second to breathe...actually, no, that wasn’t true.<br/>
</p><p>Time slowed when she was with her friends, stopped altogether when she was with her girlfriend.<br/>
</p><p>Their relationship had evolved in a way Rio never expected. She’d grown to understand Agatha like the back of her hand. She knew when her girlfriend was mad or on the brink of a crash out if she started twisting their matching ring, knew when Agatha was overworked when she couldn’t keep still, knew when she was hungry if she kept snapping at her.<br/>
</p><p>Along with understanding Agatha’s tells, Rio also began to understand Agatha’s mind…or…at least tried to. Agatha was, to put it lightly, one of the smartest people Rio had ever met. It was all so easy for her. Rio would be stuck on a question; Agatha would have a planned-out essay for her to use just from glancing at it. Rio wouldn’t know the date a law had been passed, Agatha would say it before you could snap your fingers.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha just had this avid need to know.<br/>
</p><p>To defy people’s expectations.<br/>
</p><p>It had broken Rio’s heart when she realised where the need came from, broke her heart further when Agatha confirmed it.<br/>
</p><p>Her mother.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“In England, we speak English. People should only speak English here; speaking anything else is downright disrespectful.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha had spent almost half her life learning Spanish.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Keeping up with politics as if you’ll be able to understand it. Turn that Sky News stuff off. All you need to know are that all the leftists need god.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha (except for Jen) was the most politically informed person Rio knew.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“You aren’t intelligent enough to get into university.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha had gotten into KCL with three A*’s.<br/>
</p><p>In a way, Rio was grateful to Evanora. Her abuse had created the most wonderful human. Someone who was intellectual, charismatic, beautiful.<br/>
</p><p>Rio loved her so much.<br/>
</p><p>She hadn’t said it yet, was waiting for the perfect moment, just like she was waiting for the perfect moment to tell her mother and the world she was dating a woman.<br/>
</p><p>She’d already decided when she rode Agatha’s strap for the first time, didn’t mention it until the week later because Rio hadn’t known if she’d meant it or if it was just the sex.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had meant it.<br/>
</p><p>She was going to the world…at some point.<br/>
</p><p>She’d also gotten to use a strap for the first time. Dark purple in the name of her girlfriend’s favourite colour.<br/>
</p><p>After that…there’s no going back. This was it for Rio, Agatha was, and they wouldn’t survive if Rio kept them a secret.<br/>
</p><p>Another recent development was Agatha’s tramp stamp which Rio died dead the first time she saw it. Initially, it’d been a joke. Agatha used a temporary tattoo patch to stick ‘Princesa’ on her lower back to mock Rio as she fucked her from behind. Rio convinced her to get a real one.<br/>
</p><p>Now, her girlfriend had a small bouquet of lavender tattooed on her beautifully pale skin. Rio hadn’t been able to stop staring at it, still caught herself doing so now two months later.<br/>
</p><p>It was then Rio realised she hadn’t seen Agatha all day. The new term meant they only had one class together. Agatha had been at university all day, and Rio had a 9 AM lecture before she was carted off to a charity event.<br/>
</p><p>She got out of bed and made her way to her girlfriend’s room.<br/>
</p><p>“Princesa?” Rio called as she entered.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha came into view, she was shuffling around on her bed, crunching sounds sounding with every movement.<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows. “What are you doing?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing,” came the hoarse reply.<br/>
</p><p>Liar.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t do that,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha sniffed. “Do what?”<br/>
</p><p>“Lie. We promised.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not lying-”<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t!” Rio cut in. “We don’t do that.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shifted uncomfortably, and Rio’s expression softened.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sorry for raising my voice, baby.”<br/>
</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha replied, turning to face Rio for the first time.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s reaction was immediate.<br/>
</p><p>She sat on Agatha’s bed cradling her tear-streaked face.<br/>
</p><p>“Why are you crying, mi vida?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head, the tears continuing.<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t want to talk about it?” Rio asked as she wiped them away.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stared at her a moment, lip between her teeth as if weighing her options. A moment later, she pulled something from underneath her. Rio furrowed her eyebrows as her girlfriend handed her a crumpled piece of paper.<br/>
</p><p>She smoothed it out, her stomach flipping when she scanned it.<br/>
</p><p>It was a picture of Agatha, or what was supposed to be Agatha. It didn’t look like her. The image had altered her appearance, warped her features, made her into something she wasn’t.<br/>
</p><p>The writing on it was what made Rio’s stomach twist.<br/>
</p><p>‘Nothing could fix that.’<br/>
</p><p>‘The true face of the devil.’<br/>
</p><p>‘Thank god your father isn’t alive to see how disgusting you’ve turned out.’<br/>
</p><p>Rio had to stop reading before she did something impulsive like hunt down Evanora Harkness and kill her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio scrunched the paper in her clenched fist. “It isn’t true,” she said matter-of-factly.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged, getting up and pushing more pieces of paper from underneath her. Rio couldn’t believe it; there were at least one hundred pages of double-sided A4 covered in butchered images of her princesa.<br/>
</p><p>She gaped at them, her fists still clenched, tears pricking her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby, your mother is sick. She needs help. What she is saying to you is the ramblings of a mad woman.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged again.<br/>
</p><p>Fear shot through Rio at the idea that Agatha might be taking what her mother was saying seriously.<br/>
</p><p>“Mi amor, say you understand.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned away.<br/>
</p><p>Nothing could stop the tears now. This wasn’t fair! Evanora had done one thing and all of a sudden, Agatha was questioning herself?<br/>
</p><p>“Baby-”<br/>
</p><p>“It’s honestly fine,” Agatha cut her off. “It’s not as bad as what she sent me last week.”<br/>
</p><p>“Last we-” Rio couldn’t finish the sentence, choking on her tears. She swiped them angrily before she continued, “How many times has she done this?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s gaze remained fixed on the wall, “nine.”<br/>
</p><p>“N-nine?” Rio spluttered.<br/>
</p><p>Because what the actual fuck? How the hell hadn’t she noticed? She thought she knew Agatha like the back of her hand. Why hadn’t she seen the tells, seen the photos, noticed a shift in Agatha’s energy?<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t know what to process first: the disappointment in herself, the anger because Agatha had been lying to her, the desperation to fix everything Evanora had destroyed.<br/>
</p><p>The anger won out.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Why?<em> Why wouldn’t you tell me about this?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“It’s not a big deal,” Agatha said nonchalantly.<br/>
</p><p>“Not a big deal?!” Rio yelled. “Your mother has been tormenting you for weeks, and you didn’t think your <em>girlfriend<em> ought to know about it?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>And this truly was the only way Evanora could get to her. She wouldn’t dare come back to London with Rio there, ready to have her arrested the second she set foot in the city. In their small village forty-five minutes away, she was untouchable. Destroying her daughter’s life one envelope at a time.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s got nothing to do with you.”<br/>
</p><p>Was Rio hearing right?<br/>
</p><p>“It concerns you, which means it has <em>everything<em> to do with me!”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped to hers. “Drop. It.” She bit out.<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed. “You’re fucking with me. There’s no way in fucking hell! Why didn’t you tell me?”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” was the swift reply.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha.”<br/>
</p><p>“No.”<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t make me ask you again-”<br/>
</p><p>“Because I was embarrassed, okay?!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows, her tone softening. “Embarrassed of what, baby?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned away again.<br/>
</p><p>“Embarrassed that…my mother might be right. That if I showed you, you’d find something you didn’t like about me.” She paused, twisting their matching ring. “It’s made me realise there are some things that I don’t like about me.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>That I don’t like about me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows pinched, tears slipping down her face.<br/>
</p><p>She’d never heard such harrowing words.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said, turning her chin so that deep blue eyes were looking at her. “That girl in those photos isn’t you. That’s not what you look like, mi amor.”<br/>
</p><p>“I…I can’t tell the difference anymore. I look in the mirror and I don’t know if the person I’m looking at is me. Suddenly, my nose has changed, or my lips don’t feel like they fit my face.”<br/>
</p><p>“How long have you been feeling this way?” Rio asked, running her fingers through Agatha’s hair.<br/>
</p><p>“Since the photos started coming.” She shrugged. “I shouldn’t have, but I’d just stare at them, wonder if that’s how everyone sees me and if I’ve been fooling myself this entire time.”<br/>
</p><p>You might as well have ripped Rio’s heart out.<br/>
</p><p>She shook her head. “No.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s lips lifted slightly. “You have to say that you’re my girlfriend.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to kill your mother,” Rio muttered.<br/>
</p><p>“Huh?” Agatha questioned.<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio said, grabbing Agatha by the hand and tugging her into the bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>“Why are we-”<br/>
</p><p>“Shush,” Rio interrupted, gazing back at their reflection in the mirror before them.<br/>
</p><p>Silence washed over them, Agatha taking herself in for a brief moment.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio told her, pushing Agatha’s chin back when she turned away.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t want to look at her, Rio,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>As in herself.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Not me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>As if she’d separated her mind from her body.<br/>
</p><p>“Why not, baby? She’s beautiful,” Rio whispered in her ear.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Her mind is brilliant, her soul just as much.”<br/>
</p><p>A tear slipped from Agatha’s closed eye, and Rio didn’t hesitate to brush it away with the backs of her knuckles.<br/>
</p><p>“And even if you don’t believe it, I do, will continue to believe it for the both of us. You know exactly who you are, Aggs,” Rio continued.<br/>
</p><p>Another tear fell.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s one of the things I admire most about you. You are so unapologetically, shamelessly yourself.” Rio wiped it away. “Don’t let your mother take that from you; she’s taken far too much.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded, fluttering her glassy eyes open.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s lips curled. “There she is. Estás radiante, mi corazon.” <em>You’re glowing, my heart.<br/>
</em></p><p>At that, Agatha’s breath hitched. She turned, hand finding Rio’s neck.<br/>
</p><p>“I lo- need to kiss you.” She did, drawing her girlfriend into her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t help the way she flinched when Agatha’s tears splattered on her face.<br/>
</p><p>Her words, they hadn’t helped.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha breathed against her lips. “Don’t do that,” she said, patting Rio’s tears.<br/>
</p><p>“Can’t help it,” Rio shrugged. “This hurts.”<br/>
</p><p>And that look on Agatha’s face, the horror, the disbelief.<br/>
</p><p>She shook her head. “I don’t want that.”<br/>
</p><p>“Baby, this isn’t about me; this is about you and how you feel right now. I shouldn’t have said anything.”<br/>
</p><p>“Well then you would’ve lied,” Agatha replied. “We don’t do that.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes with a small smile.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s gaze returned to the mirror. She leaned back, resting her head in the crook of Rio’s neck, and Rio didn’t hesitate to wrap an arm around her waist. The other hand, her left, she used to caress Agatha’s cheek.<br/>
</p><p>“If perfect needed a dictionary definition,” Rio murmured in her ear as her thumb ran over Agatha’s bottom lip.<br/>
</p><p>The shudder in response was unmissable.<br/>
</p><p>“And your eyes, princesa. I’d happily drown in them.”<br/>
</p><p>That blue Rio spoke about was fading into pitch black.<br/>
</p><p>She smiled, staring back at her girlfriend in the mirror. She needed a moment; they needed it, to simply appreciate Agatha in her entirety.<br/>
</p><p>There weren’t words for this, for much Rio loved Agatha. For how much she loved every part of her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tilted her head curiously as she stared her reflection down, squeezing Rio’s arm around her.<br/>
</p><p>“And guess what,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised one of her perfect eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“Your mother doesn’t have a single A-level, and what did you tell me, that she has two GCSEs?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snorted.<br/>
</p><p>“She’s got absolutely nothing on you. Who’s in higher education? Who’s going on to do a master's? Who’s going to be one of the best lawyers in the world?” Rio continued.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was giggling now.<br/>
</p><p>“Might I add, you’re doing it all on your own. She can’t take any of it, Aggs. Not your brains, not your beauty, not what you’re going to achieve, and it kills her. That’s why she’s attacking the <em>only<em> thing she can.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha nodded. “She can’t take any of it,” she echoed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio exhaled deeply; it seemed like her words were finally setting in. “You told me you want power against your mother, and I’m telling you, Aggs, you already have it.”<br/>
</p><p>The smirk that followed, the one that Rio would start a war to protect, appeared on Agatha’s face.<br/>
</p><p>“I do, don’t I?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s smirk joined her girlfriend’s in the mirror reflection. “You do.”<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha’s smirk turned into a grin, it was all teeth.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank god I have the Princess of Spain to stop me from spiralling now. What would I ever do without you?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio threw her head back cackling.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s expression softened a little. “No, en serio.” <em>No, seriously.<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio’s laughter cut off instantaneously.<br/>
</p><p>“I-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s ringtone sliced through the air, interrupting the sudden quiet that had washed over them.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “Answer it.”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t-”<br/>
</p><p>She rolled her eyes, tugging Rio out of the bathroom, found Rio’s phone on the bed and handed it to her.<br/>
</p><p>It was Rio’s turn to roll her eyes because she swore to god he always interrupted the most important moments.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Qué?” <em>What?<em> Rio snapped.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“¿Eh…hola, Fia? ¿Qué te pasa?” <em>Erm...hi, Fia. What’s wrong with you?<em> Carlos replied.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Estoy ocupada.” <em>I'm busy.<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha snorted, and Rio slapped at her making her snort again.<br/>
</p><p>“Seré rápido.” <em>I’ll be quick.<em> Carlos told her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio huffed. “Vamos, vamos, vamos.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was full-on cackling now.<br/>
</p><p>Rio did the ‘wanker’ gesture with her hand as Carlos continued on the other end:<br/>
</p><p>“¿Esa es, Aggs?” <em>Is that, Aggs?<em>  Carlos asked, his new delight evident.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Sí.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ponme en altavoz.” <em>Put me on speaker.<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio complied.<br/>
</p><p>“Hermanas ¡esta es su invitación oficial a mi fiesta de cumpleaños!” <em>Sisters, this is your official invitation to my birthday party!<em> Carlos exclaimed.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The girlfriends glanced at each other.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Qué?” <em>What?<em> Agatha said.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Carlos huffed. “Fia, you haven’t mentioned my parties to Agatha?”<br/>
</p><p>“I have,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Then what are you confused about-”<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…maybe about the fact that the party is in Spain.”<br/>
</p><p>“So?” Carlos questioned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Madre mía.” <em>My goodness.<em> “Which means Aggs can’t come.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Yes, she can,” Carlos replied without missing a beat.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Qué?”<br/>
</p><p>“It’s all sorted. Dates, flights, the rest of your friends are coming too.”<br/>
</p><p>And Rio knew he was grinning.<br/>
</p><p>“But Mami won’t-”<br/>
</p><p>“That’s sorted too.”<br/>
</p><p>The girlfriends glanced at each other again, expressions of disbelief mirrors. Of fucking course Carlos convinced their mother to fly Rio’s friends out to Spain just for his birthday. Rio would never dream of doing such a thing.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked. “I…guess we’re going to Spain then?”<br/>
</p><p>And then it hit her. Rio was finally taking her girlfriend home. She could show her Madrid, introduce her to her Abuela, the list was endless.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos did this for her. Sure, it was about his birthday, but this was also about his sister.<br/>
</p><p>“Te amo, Carlos,” because that was all Rio could think of to say.<br/>
</p><p>“Lo sé.” <em>I know.<em> Carlos replied, and he was most definitely grinning.</em></em></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Oh, Madrid. How Agatha loved it.<br/>
</p><p>Minus almost burning to death due to the unexpected heatwave, she was in her element. From the food, the music, the scenery, all of it, everything. Rio had taken her on a late-night walk around Parque de El Retiro, shown her Plaza Mayor and talked her ear off about the history behind it, taken her to La Latina on a Sunday, walked through the narrow streets and browsed through El Rastro flea market before ending the evening at a tapas bar.<br/>
</p><p>Her accommodation wasn’t bad either…<br/>
</p><p>The Royal Palace of Madrid, to put it lightly, was one of the most beautiful buildings Agatha had ever laid eyes on. The extravagant limestone palace that stretched for as far as the eye could see just happened to be her girlfriend’s home. And don’t even get her started on the interior. Everything from the Spanish marble that created the stairs, the mahogany doors, the art that adorned every wall and the statues that filled every empty space was the definition of perfection.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha made a joke about how she couldn’t believe Rio had traded all this for their measly accommodation back in London, especially when she’d seen Rio’s room.<br/>
</p><p>Her princess had a King-sized four-post bed in the centre, the ceiling just happened to be covered in a fresco by Italian artist Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, a handful of chaise longues dotted the place and Rio-Sofia’s walk-in closet? Agatha didn’t know how she hadn’t gotten lost. Rio’s influence on the place was undeniable. She felt it most on the balcony which her girlfriend turned into a mini forest with all the plants she’d covered it in.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha could genuinely see it, her living here. Rio had grown accustomed to London, but Agatha knew some part of her always missed home. Madrid could easily become Agatha’s. Maybe she was getting ahead of herself. They still had two years of university left and Agatha’s master’s, who knew what their lives would look like by then.<br/>
</p><p>She huffed. “Are you sure you can’t sack it off?”<br/>
</p><p>“No, mi amor,” came the reply from the bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>“But you promised you’d take me to that rooftop garden thingy.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio emerged from her ensuite wearing a denim miniskirt and button-up short-sleeve <em>Chanel<em> set. She had an orange and blue brooch on the left side of her chest and a smaller one on the shirt pocket just below. Her hair was straight, makeup soft, and her stack of earrings apart from her firsts, gone.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Welcome back the Princess of Spain.<br/>
</p><p>“I know, and I am sorry. I didn’t know my mother was going to drag me into this shit.”<br/>
</p><p>“The whole point of me coming to Spain early was so that we could spend time together before the girls got here,” Agatha complained.<br/>
</p><p>“This isn’t my fault, Agatha,” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha parted her lips to bite back until she stopped. She knew how much Rio hated doing the princess shit, and she wasn’t helping.<br/>
</p><p>“I know,” Agatha replied softly, tugging Rio into her arms. “I’m sorry. I’m just mugged off that I can’t spend the day with you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rested her head on her shoulder. “Me too.”<br/>
</p><p>A knock on the door.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha hated how quickly Rio pulled away.<br/>
</p><p>They were in the lion’s den, sure, but Agatha hadn’t seen the Queen in the three days she’d been in Madrid.<br/>
</p><p>“Fia?” That small voice called.<br/>
</p><p>Rio relaxed, stepping back into Agatha’s space. “Entra, Ana.” <em>Come in, Ana.<br/>
</em></p><p>Ana did.<br/>
</p><p>“¡Buenos días!" <em>Good morning!<br/>
</em></p><p>“Buenos días," the girlfriends replied.<br/>
</p><p>Ana furrowed her eyebrows, taking in Agatha in her pyjamas and Rio in her Chanel set.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Adónde vas tú?” <em>Where are you going?<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “No sé. Sigo las órdenes de mami.” <em>I don’t know. I’m following mami’s orders.<br/>
</em></p><p>“Oh. ¿No vas, Aggs?” <em>You’re not going, Aggs?<br/>
</em></p><p>She shook her head, and Ana grinned.<br/>
</p><p>“Wanna spend the day with me?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s grin mirrored hers. “Vale.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Would Agatha ever get used to walking around with a bodyguard? Probably not, but at least Ana didn’t have to wear a disguise like Rio did when they went to crowded places.<br/>
</p><p>The sun was sweltering like it had been the entire trip. Agatha was wearing a literal minidress with spaghetti straps, and she was still sweating. A gift from Rio. The red dress with its ruffled bottom, see-through knitted body and double-layered bust was her favourite thing she’d ever worn.<br/>
</p><p>Ana slipped her hand in hers and tugged.<br/>
</p><p>“¡Venga, vamos, Aggs!” <em>Come on, let’s go, Aggs!<br/>
</em></p><p>“¿A dónde vamos?” <em>Where are we going?<em> Agatha said through a laugh.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Ana didn’t reply, just kept tugging her down the street. When Ana did stop, Agatha found she was looking at a set of street performers getting ready to play. Her eyes darted from the guitars to the cajón and castanets.<br/>
</p><p>Ana looked up with a smile. “They’re my favourite performers, but they only play here once a week and I wanted to show you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Gracias.”<br/>
</p><p>“No pasa nada.”<br/>
</p><p>It didn’t take long for flamenco music to fill her ears. Soon, a crowd accumulated. The clapping and dancing following in succession. Agatha laughed, pulling her phone from her handbag to record Ana, who hadn’t hesitated to join the crowd dancing.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha muttered when the <em>iCloud storage full<em> notification popped up.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She needed to sort that out. Her camera roll had stayed full ever since she started dating the princess. She couldn’t help it; Rio just happened to look adorable at every second of every day, and Agatha wanted the memories forever.<br/>
</p><p>Sue her.<br/>
</p><p>She put her phone away the same time Ana dragged her into the crowd. Did all Vidal’s have a knack for dancing? Ana was phenomenal, steps hitting every beat, body moving to the rhythm as she moved Agatha along by their joined hands.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t think I’m cut out for this,” Agatha said, trying to keep up.<br/>
</p><p>“Lo estás haciendo muy bien.” <em>You’re doing very well.<em> Ana encouraged.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I-” Agatha began before her foot caught on cobbled stone and she stumbled. She deadpanned, and Ana snorted.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows, a smile appearing. “You snort now?”<br/>
</p><p>Ana shrugged. “I like when you do it…might’ve copied you.”<br/>
</p><p>And for some reason, Agatha felt like tearing up. Rio’s family always made her feel so seen, even when they’d just met her. Was this what it felt like to have a family? Was this what she’d been missing out on her entire life?<br/>
</p><p>“Suits you.”<br/>
</p><p>Ana grinned as Agatha spun her.<br/>
</p><p>When the song came to an end, Agatha was sweating, more so, if that were even possible. She fanned under her arms and blew the hair that came out of her bun out of her face.<br/>
</p><p>“Agua,” Ana nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Sí.”<br/>
</p><p>They went into the closest shop and Ana’s bodyguard bought them both a bottle. Ana’s hand was in Agatha’s again when they returned to the street. Vibrant flowers in their bouquets outside a shop window caught her eye.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s Fia’s favourite shop,” Ana commented. “She wanted to take you today.”<br/>
</p><p>Well Agatha <em>had<em> to go in now.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Vamos,” Agatha said. “Let’s make her a bouquet.”<br/>
</p><p>The complete arrangement consisted of orange orchards, lavender and pink lilies (Ana’s contribution).<br/>
</p><p>“Este es un ramo grande.” <em>This is a big bouquet.<em> The florist commented.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>"Es para su novia." <em>It’s for her girlfriend.<em> Ana jumped in before Agatha could.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She shook her head playfully.<br/>
</p><p>Once the bouquet was arranged in the way Agatha knew Rio would like, she paid and left with the biggest bouquet known to man slung over her shoulder.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s go home then, those need water,” Ana said.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded, and right on cue, Ana laced her fingers with hers.<br/>
</p><p>Yeah…Agatha could definitely live in Madrid.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
“</p><p>Aggs!”<br/>
</p><p>She turned to see Carlos coming up behind her. Ana had some homework to do, and she’d been left to return to Rio’s room alone.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s up?”<br/>
</p><p>“I…” Carlos trailed off, taking in the sum of flowers she held. “She’ll love them.”<br/>
</p><p>“She better. No one told me how heavy flowers are.”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“What’d you need?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos took the flowers off her and together they headed to Rio’s room.<br/>
</p><p>“I haven’t told anyone I’m doing this yet…I’m still unsure, so I wanted to get your opinion.”<br/>
</p><p>The Prince of Spain…the future King…wanted Agatha’s opinion on something he hadn’t told anyone else? Yeah, because this was just her life now.<br/>
</p><p>“Go on,” she prompted.<br/>
</p><p>“I want to speak at this LGBT+ event tomorrow. I want to let the world know that the Spanish royal family are changing with the times. I want to show my support for Rio, let her know that there are actions behind my words.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t know what to say. Time and time again Carlos had shown up for his sister, even when their own mother hadn’t. It filled her with so much joy to know that no matter what, Rio would always have her brother.<br/>
</p><p>“I…yeah. You should do it.”<br/>
</p><p>A smile flew onto Carlos’ lips. “Really?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded. “But if you’re still not sure, you can also talk to Rio about it.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah.”<br/>
</p><p>They continued down the long corridors.<br/>
</p><p>“Would you…help me write my speech?”<br/>
</p><p>“W-what?” Agatha spluttered.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos burst out laughing. “What?”<br/>
</p><p>“You want <em>me<em> to help you, the future King of Spain, with a speech?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Of course. You’re only the world's best lawyer.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m not a lawyer yet, Carlos.”<br/>
</p><p>“But you will be,” he replied easily. “And you’ll be the best. I’ve decided.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. That easy confidence that Carlos exuded back at full force. Whatever he said went.<br/>
</p><p>“So…will you help me?”<br/>
</p><p>She’d be stupid not to.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio was so fucking pissed off if someone even breathed funny, she was going to strangle them.<br/>
</p><p>Firstly, her mother had dragged her to an event even though she knew she had a ‘friend’ visiting from university and had promised to excuse Rio from all public appearances until her friends left. Secondly, the event was another <em>Ruiz Watches<em> bruncheon, which meant fucking Mateo was there because he too was home for the Easter Holidays. Thirdly, her mother informed her she was throwing a dinner in the palace later that evening, which Rio needed to attend.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>It'd taken a lot of arguing and her father stepping in for the Queen to agree to let Agatha come. Rio had to remind her mother of how rude it would be to leave a guest on their own whilst they were staying with them.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t understand why she needed to come early,” her mother said as they entered the palace.<br/>
</p><p>“Because Agatha’s my best friend and I wanted to show her Madrid before we left.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Best friend.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>It tasted like acid in her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>The Queen sighed. “Fine.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio turned to leave when her mother’s voice stopped her.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you wearing tonight?"<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t know.” Rio tried and failed to keep the irritation out of her voice.<br/>
</p><p>“Come, let’s pick it out,” her mother told her, nudging Rio towards her room.<br/>
</p><p>“Can’t we do this later?” Rio suggested.<br/>
</p><p>Because right now, the only thing she wanted to do was spend time with her girlfriend, and she was too close to screaming at her mother to continue to be around her.<br/>
</p><p>“No, Rio-Sofia,” the Queen said dismissively.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t bother hiding the eye roll.<br/>
</p><p>“I saw that.”<br/>
</p><p>“Good,” Rio grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>Moments later, they arrived at Rio’s room. She swung the door open, stopped. Her brother and girlfriend were crowded around her desk, scribbling away on a piece of paper. She waited for either of them to acknowledge her presence, and when they didn’t…<br/>
</p><p>The Queen cleared her throat.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, hi, ba-” Agatha cut herself off when she took in Rio and her mother standing next to her.<br/>
</p><p>Her girlfriend blinked, straightened.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, mum. Hi, Fia,” Carlos greeted.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey…what are you doing?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>The pair glanced at each other.<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha replied. “Hi,” she said, making her way towards her mother. “I’m Agatha, Rio’s…friend.”<br/>
</p><p>The Queen took the hand Agatha extended towards her, shook it.<br/>
</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Agatha. You speak Spanish?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>The Queen nodded, the only indication she was impressed. “Are you enjoying Madrid?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha repeated. “Very much.”<br/>
</p><p>It was only then Rio realised Agatha was wearing the dress she’d bought her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>It looked even better on her than she’d imagined. She needed to buy her girlfriend more red; it complemented her dark hair so beautifully, made her deep blue eyes pop.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-Sofia?”<br/>
</p><p>“What?” She blurted.<br/>
</p><p>Rio understood this was not the first time her mother had said her name.<br/>
</p><p>Her mother’s face shifted an inch, and if Rio hadn’t spent years watching her mother’s expressions, she wouldn’t have been able to catch the disappointment.<br/>
</p><p>“I said, shall we decide what you’re going to wear?”<br/>
</p><p>“Why?” Carlos butt in. “Mum, didn’t you say this was a casual dinner?”<br/>
</p><p>“Casual in terms of our standards, yes.”<br/>
</p><p>Which meant it wasn’t going to be casual.<br/>
</p><p>“Exactly, so let Fia wear what she wants,” Carlos said.<br/>
</p><p>The Queen’s head tilted a fraction. “She has an appearance to keep up. Mateo and his father will be there and-”<br/>
</p><p>“Which further proves my point. You’re so hellbent on this match between them, and yet Rio’s never been allowed to dress or act like herself around him. Who would want to be with someone they don’t know?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t dare look at Agatha, couldn’t stand to see the pain that was most likely etched across her face. In the grand scheme of things, she knew Agatha would understand. Her brother, just like her girlfriend, was ruthless, said anything to get what he wanted.<br/>
</p><p>Today, that meant using Mateo.<br/>
</p><p>Their mother narrowed her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, it’s you who wants this,” Carlos shrugged. “Might I add, you said this was casual,” he concluded, leaning back on Rio’s desk.<br/>
</p><p>The Queen sighed. “Very well.” She turned to leave. “What would you do without your brother to fight your battles, I wonder?” She asked only loud enough for Rio to hear.<br/>
</p><p>Then she was gone.<br/>
</p><p>Rio swallowed. She could fight her own battles…couldn’t she?<br/>
</p><p>“Now that you’re both here,” Carlos started, interrupting her thoughts. “Aggs, I have another question.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows. “Another-?”<br/>
</p><p>Her brother came over, phone out and angled towards Agatha. “Is this you?”<br/>
</p><p>Her girlfriend’s eyes flared. “No.”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos grinned. “You replied instantly which means you’re lying. Good try though.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flushed red.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you talking about?”<br/>
</p><p>“Your-”<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing!” Agatha cut in.<br/>
</p><p>Carlos burst out laughing.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t have time for this. She swiped the phone from Carlos’s hand and made a break for it whilst simultaneously trying to read the screen.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha shrieked as Rio batted her hands away.<br/>
</p><p>Her brother’s cackles came just the same.<br/>
</p><p>“Who’s @actuallyriosofiasgf?”<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha,” Carlos smirked.<br/>
</p><p>A smile appeared on Rio’s face. “What?”<br/>
</p><p>The flush on her girlfriend’s cheeks only deepened.<br/>
</p><p>“Why do you have a Twitter account called that?”<br/>
</p><p>“I-”<br/>
</p><p>“To troll people,” Carlos replied without missing a beat.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Rio said through a laugh. “Why?”<br/>
</p><p>“I-”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos took his phone back, clicked around. “Read that.”<br/>
</p><p>“’I need her to do ungodly things to me.’” Rio said aloud. She blinked. “Her as in…as in me?”<br/>
</p><p>Carlos nodded.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Jesus.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>This is why Rio didn’t have Twitter.<br/>
</p><p>“Here in which Agatha replied, ‘Seek mental help.’” Carlos finished.<br/>
</p><p>Rio turned to her, eyebrow raised. Agatha said nothing, just folded her arms with a scowl.<br/>
</p><p>“There’s more, look,” Carlos encouraged.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped to a paparazzi picture of her in London. She wore a red retro Spain football jersey, dark-washed baggy jeans with the lace trim of her white underwear on show (a fashion statement she’d stolen from her girlfriend) to match her white <em>Wales Bonner X Adidas Sambas.<br/>
</em></p><p>“Loved that outfit,” Rio commented.<br/>
</p><p>“No, the caption.”<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Maia:<br/>
<em>Quick, get the stra-<br/>
</em></strong>
</p><p>“Oh...erm…I…”<br/>
</p><p>Was there a correct way to respond to this?<br/>
</p><p>“The replies are the interesting bit,” Carlos continued.<br/>
</p><p>Rio scrolled.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Bea:<br/>
<em>delete this before you know who finds you.<br/>
</em></strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Maia:<br/>
<em>Can’t even thirst about my Spanish princess anymore because of woke.<br/>
</em></strong>
</p><p>
<strong>A:<br/>
<em>Yours?<br/>
</em></strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Bea:<br/>

</em></strong>
</p><p>
<strong>A:<br/>
<em>Ijbol. Rio-Sofia doesn’t even know you exist, mind you, she’s lying right next to me as I type this.<br/>
</em></strong>
</p><p>Rio looked up, her mouth open in disbelief before she burst out laughing.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs?!”<br/>
</p><p>“What?!”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re terrorising people on Twitter?” Rio cackled.<br/>
</p><p>“Only a couple!” Agatha argued.<br/>
</p><p>“More like the entire fandom,” Carlos smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Snake.”<br/>
</p><p>He shrugged. “Welcome to having siblings.”<br/>
</p><p>“How did you know it was me?” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Rio and Carlos deadpanned.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you serious? It took me one tweet to figure that out.”<br/>
</p><p>“And our social media team snuffed you out the second you made your account,” Carlos added with a grin.<br/>
</p><p>“Jealousy is a disease,” Rio teased.<br/>
</p><p>“Whatever,” Agatha grumbled with an eyeroll.<br/>
</p><p>“Right,” Carlos clapped. “I’m gonna get ready.” He picked up the piece of paper he and Agatha were working on. “See you both later.”<br/>
</p><p>“Bye,” the girlfriends said in unison.<br/>
</p><p>Dark brown locked with deep blue. She switched to English asking:<br/>
</p><p>“So you’re defending my honour then?”<br/>
</p><p>“I bought you flowers,” was the reply instead.<br/>
</p><p>“What-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned Rio’s head to her balcony where a large vase was overflowing with fresh flowers. Lilies, lavender, orchids. Every colour working in perfect harmony.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby, those are beautiful,” Rio told her, going to them.<br/>
</p><p>“You like?”<br/>
</p><p>“Love,” Rio corrected, cupping an orange orchid. “Thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re welcome. Thank Ana too; she helped.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. “I will. What’s the occasion?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Just cuz.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes, tugging Agatha back inside. “You’ve been buying me a lot of ‘just cuz’ flowers recently.”<br/>
</p><p>“Wow! You’re very perceptive!” Agatha replied sarcastically.<br/>
</p><p>“Why?” Rio continued undeterred.<br/>
</p><p>"Sod off,” Agatha said, trying and failing to wiggle out of Rio’s grip.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered. “Tell me,” she said, pulling Agatha closer.<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes glared at her for a moment before she rushed out:<br/>
</p><p>“Because for some stupid reason I just want to buy you everything that reminds me of you, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s lips lifted. “You and me both, baby girl.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not sure,” Rio said, looking at herself in the mirror.<br/>
</p><p>They’d had to get ready in triple the speed because hands had wandered, teasing remarks were exchanged, and somehow, they’d ended up naked. Her mother was going to kill her if they were late.<br/>
</p><p>“Why?” Agatha asked. “Red lipstick looks good on you.”<br/>
</p><p>“But it’s more your thing.”<br/>
</p><p>“Could be <em>our<em> thing,” Agatha replied without missing a beat.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She came up behind Rio, wrapping her arms around her waist. Rio took them in. Her in her long black silk backless dress, and Agatha in her deep purple floor-length plunge halter-neck satin dress.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Did they look good together.<br/>
</p><p>Rio brought her hand up to clasp onto one of Agatha’s, their gold and silver matching rings resting easily next to the other. A smile began to form on Rio’s lips as Agatha rested her chin on her shoulder. This was so it for her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to tell my mum about us soon, I promise.”<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes locked with hers in the mirror.<br/>
</p><p>“You always say that and yet…”<br/>
</p><p>“No, I know. I mean it this time,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Words are just words, princesa.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded because what else could she say?<br/>
</p><p>Agatha let go and sat on the bed to put her heels on. She didn’t say anything else until…<br/>
</p><p>“Why are you taking that off?” Her eyes dropped to the ‘A’ necklace that was now in Rio’s hand instead of around her neck. “You never take it off.”<br/>
</p><p>“I can’t hide it with this dress on.”<br/>
</p><p>“But we match,” Agatha told her, tugging at the gold ‘R’ necklace Rio bought her yesterday.<br/>
</p><p>“But we can’t.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stared at her.<br/>
</p><p>“You should probably take yours off too.”<br/>
</p><p>That stare turned into a glare.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>’I’ll tell my mum about us soon, I promise,’<em>” Agatha mimicked. “And yet we can’t even wear our fucking necklaces.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Her girlfriend yanked hers off and slammed it on the desk beside Rio. She pulled their ring off too.<br/>
</p><p>“Probably shouldn’t be wearing that either,” Agatha snapped before she left Rio alone in her room.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>All three of us know you won’t do well being hidden, Agatha.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Wanda’s voice in her head out of all fucking people.<br/>
</p><p>Well fuck Wanda and her words from five months ago. Rio wasn’t hiding her girlfriend…well…she wouldn’t from now on.</p>

<p><em>But we can’t.</em></p><p>How many times would she have to hear it? How many times would Rio promise to tell her mother and fail to do so? How many times could Agatha ignore how much having to hide was eating away at her?</p><p><em>All three of us know you won’t do well being hidden, Agatha. </em></p><p>Wanda’s voice often popped into her head after arguments like that one. Without fail, the grating voice of the ginger bitch would appear, taunting and mocking as if Wanda knew anything in the fucking first place.</p><p><em>But we can’t.</em></p><p>And why not? Her girlfriend always said she was waiting for the perfect moment, but there was no such fucking thing. No matter how she spun it, she was dating a girl. Her mother would hate it just the same.</p><p>Wasn’t Rio-Sofia sick of not being able to take her hand in public, not being able to kiss her, not being able to wear their fucking matching necklaces around her family? It was always the same stupid response:</p><p><em>But we can’t.</em></p><p>Agatha huffed, her neck already feeling bare without the chain that had only just found a home around it. She tried to ignore the feeling, focusing on the click-clacking of her heels against marble. Maybe she shouldn’t have been so impulsive about leaving; she didn’t have a fucking clue where she was headed. Agatha rolled her eyes when she went to twist the ring on her left index finger and remembered she’d taken it off.  </p><p>Why the <em>fuck</em> had she done that?</p><p>What was a girl without her emotional support jewellery?</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p><em>Thank god. </em></p><p>She turned, locking eyes with Carlos at the end of the hall in a pinstriped <em>Tom Ford </em>suit.</p><p>“You look nice,” Carlos commented as she approached. He kissed both her cheeks in greeting.</p><p>“Thank you. You look alright, I guess.”</p><p>Carlos laughed, and she couldn’t help but smile. The sibling banter came so naturally, like they’d been this way their entire lives.</p><p>“I’ll take it. Where’s Fia?”</p><p>Agatha’s smile had never faded so fast. Oh, yeah, because they’d just had a stupid argument.</p><p>“Erm-”</p><p>“Here I am.”</p><p>Agatha felt Rio-Sofia behind her, hated how her skin still tingled when Rio’s arm skimmed hers.</p><p>“Is that the suit we got the other day?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Mhm. How does it look on?”</p><p>“Alright,” Rio replied.</p><p>Carlos laughed again. “Your girlfriend just said that to me.”</p><p>Agatha knew Rio was glancing at her in her peripheral, hated once again how her body reacted, goosebumps travelled up her skin.</p><p>“¡Princesas!” Ana exclaimed.</p><p>Agatha looked past Carlos to see Ana running towards them in a pink ball gown, a small gold tiara atop her head of blonde curls.</p><p>“Ambas se ven hermosas.<em>” You both look beautiful. </em></p><p>“Muchas gracias.”</p><p>“Gracias,” Agatha and Rio replied.</p><p>“Tú también.” <em>So do you. </em></p><p>“¿Dónde está tu tiara?” <em>Fia, where’s your tiara? </em></p><p>“No iba a usar uno.” <em>I wasn’t going to wear one. </em>Rio replied.</p><p>Ana frowned. “Pero yo quería que coincidiéramos.” <em>But I wanted to match. </em></p><p>The reply wasn’t immediate, Agatha knowing her girlfriend was weighing her options without looking at her.</p><p>“Vale.”</p><p>Ana grinned. “Vamos.”</p><p>Agatha jolted when Ana tugged her along with them.</p><p>She’d never been in the crown room before, shouldn’t have been surprised by how full it was. On every surface of the small space was a velvet cushion topped with jewellery. Agatha tried not to gape, failed. Her eyes darted from the emerald-crusted tiara on her left, to the simple gold one on her right, to the rows of diamond brooches before her.</p><p>Yeah…because her girlfriend casually had access to all of this.</p><p>Agatha ventured further into the room until she stopped short. She would recognise the <em>Cartier Pearl and Diamond Tiara</em> anywhere.</p><p><em>Me gustaría disculparme</em>…<em>I would like to apologise for… </em></p><p>Rio’s voice, Rio’s speech, Rio’s biggest regret.</p><p>The day she lied, the day she denied who she was, the day she was forced to hide her sexuality from the world.</p><p>The weight of all of that staring back at her in the form of a devastatingly beautiful tiara.</p><p>Agatha heard Rio’s breath hitch, knew she’d seen it too. She didn’t hesitate, turned to look at Rio for the first time that evening.</p><p>“Oh, darlin.”</p><p>Tears rimmed her princess’s eyes. She probably hadn’t seen the thing since the last time she wore it. It needed binning, no, to be trodden on a thousand times over by a herd of elephants.</p><p>No thoughts.</p><p>She pulled Rio-Sofia into a hug, ran her fingers through her loose curls.</p><p>“You’re okay,” Agatha soothed.</p><p>And now Agatha just felt dumb. No wonder Rio needed to work up the courage to tell her mother about them. The last time the topic of her sexuality came up, the Queen forced her back into the closet.</p><p>“¿Rio, qué pasa? <em>Rio, what’s wrong? </em>Ana squeaked.</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio replied, wiping at her tears. “Estoy reventada.” <em>I’m exhausted. </em></p><p>A smile split Rio’s lips when her sister joined the hug.</p><p>“Lo siento,” Ana mumbled.</p><p>“It’s not your fault,” Rio replied.</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped to the right when she heard a camera snapping.</p><p>The three girls scowled at their brother.</p><p>“You’ll thank me for that later,” Carlos said nonchalantly, putting his phone away.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes before pulling away. “Which one should I wear?” She asked Agatha, indicating to the tiaras.</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “You’re asking me?”</p><p>“Course.”</p><p>Agatha extracted herself from the hug and made a beeline for the tiara in the furthest corner of the room.</p><p>“This one,” she said, pointing at the <em>Mellerio Shell Tiara, </em>a custom-made piece for Queen Isabella II.</p><p>“Me encanta esa.” <em>I love that one. </em>Ana commented.</p><p>A knock on the door.</p><p>“La cena está lista, Sus Altezas.” <em>The dinner is ready, Your Highnesses. </em>A voice came from behind.</p><p>Carlos huffed. “Vamos.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>She didn’t let go of Agatha’s pinkie. The risk? Huge. The fucks Rio gave? None.</p><p>She was telling her mother soon so she might as well dip a toe in. Rio held her girlfriend’s finger behind her dress as she spoke with distant cousins and politics, held it when they were forced to make conversation with Mateo.</p><p>More than once, Agatha tried to let go, and every time Rio only tightened her grip. The lies, the secrets, the sneaking around would be over soon. This was her way of letting Agatha know that.</p><p>Only once did Rio hesitate, and that was when she locked eyes with her father. She knew he’d seen it with the way his gaze flicked behind her dress and returned to her eyes. She swallowed, waited for the outcry…</p><p>It never came.</p><p>Her father shook his head playfully before continuing his conversation with her mother and Carlos.</p><p>Rio smiled. That wasn’t so bad.</p><p>One parent down, the worst to go.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>“We’re fucking,” Agatha announced the second they got back to Rio’s room.</p><p>Her girlfriend laughed. “What-” Rio got cut off when Agatha spun her around, yanked at her dress zip, pulled her tiara off and tossed it on the bed.</p><p>“I just spent three hours being bored to death listening to conversations I could barely keep up with because everyone was talking so fast. I deserve a reward,” she continued, ripping Rio’s dress off.</p><p>She twisted Rio around again, grabbed her ass and squeezed. Yeah, that fucking did it, the brown in her princess’s eyes dissolved to black.</p><p>“Too easy,” Agatha smirked. “And no underwear? Slut,” she husked against her girlfriend's lips.</p><p>“Shut up,” came the reply before Rio crashed their lips together.</p><p>It took mere seconds for Rio to rid Agatha of her dress. Her girlfriend devoured her, her tongue exploring Agatha’s mouth, licking at her teeth, moving harshly against hers. Rio fisted her hair, jerking her head back to angle Agatha exactly the way she wanted her.</p><p>Oh, to be handled this way by her princess.</p><p>If the Agatha from five months ago could see her now, what would she say? <em>You’ve lost the mother fucking plot, mate. </em>Maybe she had. Agatha searched her entire life for power, and yet she felt it most when she gave in, let the person with the <em>most </em>power take it from her.</p><p><em>Take it from me. </em></p><p>When Rio pulled harder.</p><p><em>Take it from me. </em></p><p>When Rio threw her onto the bed.</p><p><em>Take it from me. </em></p><p>When Rio sank her teeth into her neck.</p><p>Did anything else matter outside of this little bubble they’d created?</p><p>Why should it?</p><p>There was the rest of the world, and then there was them.</p><p>“I wanna…I wanna try something,” Rio mumbled against her skin.</p><p>“Whatever you want,” Agatha replied.</p><p>Rio paused, pulled back.</p><p>Agatha knew why; it was usually Rio who gave in so readily.</p><p>Her girlfriend smirked. “You’re not even going to question me today, princesa?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha breathed.</p><p>Brown eyes flicked between the blue beneath her, her expression softening.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I take it back.”</p><p>A grin flew onto Rio’s lips. “You can’t.” And then she was dipping down to dot kisses on Agatha’s face.</p><p>They fell back into the rhythm they always did, effortlessly getting lost in the way they consumed each other. Agatha didn’t question the fact that Rio had moved her to the edge of the bed, didn’t question why she’d sat behind her, didn’t-</p><p>She stared at their naked bodies in the mirror.</p><p><em>Fucking hell. </em></p><p>Is that what she looked like?</p><p>Rio’s red lipstick covered her chin, her mascara and eyeliner were smudged, and her hair was mussed, layers all over the place. She smiled, noticing Rio in the same predicament.</p><p>“We really did a number on each other, huh?” Rio murmured in her ear the same time she brushed the hair from Agatha’s neck, letting cool air hit it</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut when Rio pressed a tender kiss to heated skin, snapped them open when she realised she wanted to see, wanted to watch herself crumble under the princess’s touch.</p><p>“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do this,” Rio hummed, biting her earlobe.</p><p>Agatha watched her reflection’s mouth part in response, heard her moan bounce off the walls.</p><p>“Oh, my pretty girl, look how desperate you look.”</p><p>And she did.</p><p>Agatha never thought she could look the way she did. Her pupils had engulfed her irises, she was nibbling feverishly at her swollen lip, and she was gripping onto Rio’s knees for dear life.</p><p><em>God. </em></p><p>She looked fucking pathetic.</p><p>Rio made her pathetic.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes locked with Rio’s in the mirror, realised again that Rio looked just like her.</p><p>Agatha made Rio pathetic.</p><p>“You’re missing something,” Rio told her.</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. “I’m not-”</p><p>She cut herself off when Rio placed her tiara on her head, running her fingers through her hair to make sure it stayed put.</p><p>“You forgot your tiara, princesa.”</p><p>And now Agatha understood why Rio had asked her to pick. All she could do was blink. Was that her in the reflection staring back? Was that her with a diamond, platinum and pearl-encrusted tiara adorning her head, her Spanish Princess behind her? Rio’s lips curled as she gazed at her.</p><p>“I don’t know what to say.”</p><p>“Don’t say anything,” Rio whispered, her hand sliding between Agatha’s thighs to spread them open.</p><p>“You’re soaked,” Rio said, eyes fixated on Agatha’s dripping cunt in the mirror.</p><p>“Glad we’re – <em>hm</em>,” when Rio easily slid two fingers in. “Glad we’re stating the fucking obvious.”</p><p>Rio grinned before her free hand snaked up Agatha’s body to squeeze her breast. She couldn’t help the way she dissolved into Rio, couldn’t help the way she groaned when she saw Rio pinch her nipple in the mirror. It was a strange sort of sensation to watch and feel her slick rushing out of her.</p><p>“That’s my good girl,” Rio cooed, her fingers pumping effortlessly with the new wetness.</p><p>Agatha saw the way her eyes were glazing over, saw the way her bottom lip quivered as her mouth kept parting, saw the way her cheeks flushed.</p><p>She’d never looked so good in her life.</p><p>Her eyes returned to Rio, wasn’t surprised when her core leaked again. Her girlfriend was gone, mesmerised by the way Agatha was coming undone by her hands alone. What would they look like falling from grace side by side?</p><p>No thoughts.</p><p>Agatha took her left hand off Rio’s knee and brought it behind her, hummed when she made contact with damp curls, hummed again when she met no resistance, three fingers pressing into wet folds. Her arm would definitely make her pay for this later, but right now she didn’t care. All that mattered was making sure her girlfriend could see and feel her pleasure.</p><p>“You feel so good, baby,” Agatha got out.</p><p>And that whimper in response, the head nod, because it was all Rio could manage.</p><p>Drive the knife in.</p><p>She shifted, leaning on Rio’s right side, angling her head up. When Rio’s fingers curled, she let her moans tumble directly into her girlfriend’s ear. The reaction was immediate, Rio’s walls pulsing around Agatha’s fingers.</p><p>She couldn’t help the grin.</p><p>Rio’s eyes drifted shut, and that just wouldn’t do.</p><p>“Look at us or I’ll stop.”</p><p>On command, her princess’s eyes reopened.</p><p>“Good boy.”</p><p>Again, Rio could no longer vocalise her response.</p><p>It was exhilarating to <em>watch </em>the build-up to the release. The way their bodies tightened, backs arched, the more frequent, desperate way their lips kept parting the faster their fingers pumped. Agatha knew it was because of this why she was falling over the edge faster than usual. It took one press of Rio’s thumb over her clit for Agatha to throw her back, a moan ripping from her throat, the tiara slipping backwards.</p><p>Rio’s hand grabbed her face and brought it back down so that Agatha caught the last of her orgasm. Her girlfriend held her head in place, forcing her to watch herself ride it out.</p><p>“Jesus,” Agatha got out.</p><p>Why was watching herself come one of the hottest things she’d ever seen?</p><p>“Fuck I look good,” she panted.</p><p>Rio grinned. “I get to see that every time.”</p><p>“Lucky you.”</p><p>Her girlfriend laughed, and it was only then Agatha remembered her fingers had stopped.</p><p>“Oh, shit. Sorry, baby-”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “I’m getting the strap.”</p><p>A slow smirk slid across Agatha’s face as her girlfriend detangled herself. She adjusted the tiara with her clean hand whilst sucking on the other covered in her girlfriend’s slick.</p><p>“Thank god for cranberry juice and pineapples,” Agatha teased, polishing off her digits.</p><p>“Thank god,” Rio echoed with a laugh.</p><p>When Agatha turned, Rio had already put the harness on.</p><p>“That was quick.”</p><p>“Girl’s got needs.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Well, come on then.”</p><p>Rio huffed. “I can’t find the lube.”</p><p>That grin only widened. “We won’t need it.”</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows as Agatha walked towards her.</p><p>“What-”</p><p>“I said,” Agatha guided Rio’s hand between her legs. “We won’t need it.”</p><p>Rio hummed, her fingers moving ideally through wet folds.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, felt another orgasm creeping up. When Rio removed her fingers, there was no stopping the whine that left her mouth.</p><p>“Complaining as if you’re not getting me dick.”</p><p>“I don’t have it yet,” Agatha noted, pulling the tiara off and placing it on Rio’s head before dragging them to the desk. “I’ll complain until you’re inside me. Get inside me.”  </p><p>Rio chuckled. “Oh, there she is.”</p><p>Because the brat had come out at full force.</p><p>“Desk?” Rio questioned.</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “I wanna see again.”</p><p>“Course you do,” Rio replied, bending her over.</p><p>Rio needed a beat, like always, to appreciate her girlfriend like this. That fucking tramp stamp was going to be the death of her. Rio ran her fingers over it, watched the goosebumps travel up Agatha’s skin in response. Agatha pushed her ass back.</p><p>“Hurry the <em>fuck </em>up,” Agatha snapped.</p><p>“Paciencia, mi vida.”</p><p>Spanish because Rio wanted Agatha begging.</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha whined, pushing back as she stepped away. “Don’t do that.”</p><p>“¿Qué quieres decir?” <em>What do you mean? </em>Rio asked innocently.</p><p>“Te voy a matar.” <em>I’m going to kill you. </em></p><p>Rio smirked. “Go on then.”</p><p>“I-” she cut herself off when Rio slid the strap against her core.  </p><p>“You…” Rio prompted, collecting Agatha’s slick and coating the silicone with every teasing stroke.</p><p>“…Can get – <em>hm </em>– fucked. Stop – <em>fucking hell </em>– fucking with me.”</p><p>“Would I ever do such a thing?” Rio asked, hand finding her waist, gripping.</p><p>The other hand she used to thread through the hairs at the back of Agatha’s neck, held on firmly, tugged at the roots the way she knew her girlfriend liked.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>“¿Sí, nena?”</p><p>“P...please.”</p><p>Bingo.</p><p>Rio grinned. “What was that?”</p><p>Agatha let out a sound that was a cross between a whine and a whimper.</p><p>“<em>Please</em>,” Agatha repeated.</p><p>“Y en Español.” <em>And in Spanish. </em></p><p>“Puta.” <em>Bitch. </em>Agatha grumbled, making Rio laugh. “Por favor.”</p><p>“Wasn’t so hard,” Rio told her, lining up the tip and rocking her hips forward, pressing the strap in an inch. She pulled back and repeated the action, sinking further.</p><p>“Fuck!” Agatha screamed at the intrusion.</p><p>“¿Estás bien?” <em>You okay? </em> </p><p>“More!” Agatha demanded.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, hand tightening around Agatha’s neck. “Greedy girl,” she said as she withdrew.</p><p>The cry that followed when Rio sank to the hilt? She needed it tattooed in her brain. Oh, how delicious Agatha’s sounds were. She craved them, needed to hear them again. Rio withdrew and snapped her hips forward once more.</p><p>She didn’t know what to focus on, fucking harshly into her girlfriend, the way her girlfriend looked in the mirror as she did so (mouth open, flushed, tits bouncing), the way <em>she </em>looked in the mirror. It would only be brief glances, Rio preferring to watch Agatha, but she genuinely couldn’t believe it was her. The Princess of Spain was strapping her girlfriend with an over €100,000 custom-made tiara on her head.</p><p>If her late great-grandmother could see how her tiara was being worn now.</p><p>Rio was clueless as to how many times they came; all she was aware of was that at some point they’d move to the bed, and at some point Agatha was on top of her, and at some point the tiara had rolled off the bed with a clatter.</p><p>Now they were tangled in each other’s arms, breathing heavy, exhaustion evident. Rio pressed a kiss to Agatha’s damp forehead, brushing at her soft locks.</p><p>“You okay, mi amor?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Mhm. Sleepy.”</p><p>Rio smiled, tightening her grip around her. “Get some rest then.”</p><p>Silence washed over them for a long moment until Agatha asked:</p><p>“We’re okay, right?”</p><p>And the way she’d asked as if she needed it to be the truest thing in the world.</p><p>Rio pressed another kiss to her forehead. Yes, they’d fought today. Yes, Rio hadn’t made good on her promise yet. Yes, Agatha was still her best-kept secret.</p><p>Yes…that was going to change.</p><p>Rio loved her so much.</p><p>If she didn’t tell her mother and the world soon, then her world would collapse. Nothing was more important than them. So, the answer was simple:</p><p>“Yes, we will be.”</p>

<p>Today was going to end in chaos…Rio couldn’t wait.</p><p>Carlos’s birthday was always the most jampacked day of the year, this year more so with her friends from university coming. She’d have to wake up at stupid o’clock for the five-hour car drive to Nerja, get the girls settled at her Abuela’s house where they’d be staying, begin the drinking and partying at the beach around midday and then prepare and go to Carlos’s party in the evening. She was most likely going to be putting in a 12-12 drinking shift, so like Rio said…chaos.</p><p>After leaving Ana behind in the capital, the girlfriends were on hour three of five of their journey down south. Another thing Rio loved about being home was that she could drive. She hadn’t set foot in her beloved forest green <em>Ferrari Portofino</em> in months, and now she was using it to drive her girlfriend around.</p><p>Agatha giggling to herself pulled Rio’s eyes off the road to glance at her. She rolled her eyes. “You’re laughing because you can see my Hulk boxers, right?”</p><p>“No,” her girlfriend snorted, eyes fixed on the little hulk poking out beneath denim.</p><p>Rio huffed. “Sue me for thinking you wouldn’t be able to see them.”</p><p>Agatha was cackling now. “Baby, you’re wearing a miniskirt, one of <em>mine, </em>might I add. You seriously thought the skirt would be longer than the pants?”</p><p>Rio pulled a face before announcing, “For that, I’m revoking your aux privileges.”</p><p>“Noooo!” Agatha countered, batting Rio’s hand away.</p><p>“Nooowuh,” Rio mimicked.</p><p>Agatha deadpanned, her hand stilling. “You’re taking the mick, shut up.”</p><p>“Shuup,” Rio grinned.</p><p>Her girlfriend glared at her.</p><p>“You’re so funny, did you know that?” Rio continued undeterred.</p><p>Agatha said nothing, turning her attention to her phone.</p><p>“You not gonna talk to me now?” Rio teased, poking Agatha in the cheek.</p><p>Again, no reply.</p><p>“Oh, so when it’s my turn to make fun of you, I get the silent treatment? Because that’s fair.” That grin hadn’t gone anywhere. Rio lived for the simple things, and the simple things were winding up her girlfriend.</p><p>“Because you’re always so fair,” Agatha grumbled.</p><p>“<em>Ouch!</em>” Rio said, putting a hand to her heart. “My own words being thrown back at me.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Just stop talking and listen to this.”</p><p>“Baby, I’ve heard <em>Planet Her</em> a thousand times. We don’t have to listen to it in silence for me to get the ‘full experience’ I-”</p><p>“Shush,” Agatha replied, her tone playful.</p><p>The voice that filled Rio’s ears she would recognise anywhere.</p><p>“Why are we-”</p><p>Agatha waggled a finger, and Rio kept quiet.</p><p>“<em>I know a lot of people will be surprised to see me here this morning,” </em>Carlos’s voice continued in Spanish through the car speakers. <em>“On my birthday, I always choose to speak at a place on a topic I feel strongly about, and this year it’s here with you.” </em></p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha nibbling on her bottom lip. She furrowed her eyebrows.</p><p><em>“As a representative of this country, it is my duty to let it be known that I stand for all of you. The incredible work done by LoveOne LGBT+ charity deserves to be platformed and recognised.”  </em></p><p>Rio’s breath caught. She’d spoken to her brother about this, about how she would work with LoveOne if she were allowed. They did remarkable work for queer people in Spain, helping those who had gone through conversion therapy, youths who had become homeless due to not being accepted by their families, giving people a sense of community when they’d been outcast.</p><p>She loved their work; knew she’d probably need it if she weren’t who she was.</p><p><em>“From now on, I will be working closely with the extraordinary people here, and I shall be starting by donating €500,000 from my own funds.” </em></p><p>“W…what,” Rio stuttered.</p><p>Agatha only smiled.</p><p><em>“Someone very close to me brought this charity to my attention, and I’m sorry it took her finding it for me also to do so,” Carlos paused. “I want her to know that I’m with her, I will stand with her and always will.” </em></p><p>Rio had the world’s best brother.</p><p><em>“I want to remind anyone who is being told that their sexuality is poisoning them, that is not. Love isn’t prototypical; there isn’t one definition of it.”</em></p><p>‘Love isn’t prototypical,’ where had Rio heard that before?</p><p>She smelt cigarettes, the earth after it rained, and-</p><p>“He got that from you,” Rio said, remembering a conversation they’d had on her balcony a couple nights ago.</p><p>Agatha shrugged.</p><p><em>“Love comes in all shapes and sizes, and most importantly, it is never a sin.”</em></p><p>Carlos’s audience started clapping, his words getting drowned out.</p><p><em>“Thank you for having me today, and to the brilliant woman who helped me write this, thank you. I’m so grateful for you.” </em></p><p>The applause only got louder.</p><p>“That’s what you were working on the other day?” Rio asked when Agatha pressed pause.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows pinched.</p><p>What to process first?</p><p>The fact that her brother had chosen to speak up for her when she couldn’t herself, the fact that he trusted Agatha enough to let her in on it, the fact that the brilliant words of her girlfriend were going to be heard by millions across the world…</p><p>The fact that they cared about her deeply enough to do this.</p><p>“I-” <em>love you. </em>“Thank you.”</p><p>“Don’t thank me, thank Carlos. It was his idea,” Agatha told her.</p><p>“But you helped.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “It was a no-brainer.”</p><p>Rio smiled, placing a hand on Agatha’s thigh and squeezing.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>“Yep,” Jen said, taking a sip of Rio’s Abuela’s homemade mojito. “This is the fucking life.”</p><p>She couldn’t help but laugh. The girls were already there when they arrived. Her Abuela made sure they felt at home before urging them to put on their bikinis and get ready for the beach, whilst she prepared them drinks and snacks. It’d only been a couple of days since she last saw them, but it might as well have been years.</p><p>“So…you guys just like…own this?” Natasha asked, pointing to the private beach and the white mansion with coral-orange brick roofing.</p><p>“You say this as if she doesn’t live in a palace,” Jen commented.</p><p>“No, I know it’s just…” Natasha trailed off, blinking at the large house. “Jesus. Why am I dating your security guard? I should’ve gone for you when I had the chance.”</p><p>“Puta,” Lucia said, slapping at her the same time Agatha called from inside:</p><p>“I heard that!”</p><p>The girls laughed.</p><p>“Your Abuela really likes her,” Alice whispered.</p><p>Agatha’s snort filled Rio’s ears as she turned to look at her girlfriend and grandmother nattering away in the kitchen.</p><p>“No Vidal is immune to Agatha Harkness,” Rio said, stretching. “Abuela’s already planning a family trip to Puerto Rico so Abuelo can meet her too.”</p><p>“Wowww, and she hates him, that’s big.”</p><p>Rio laughed, settling further into her sunbed.</p><p>She pushed her army print <em>Yankee’s</em> cap, which matched her green and gold bikini, further onto her face to block the sun. The heatwave was no joke, and she needed to actually make it her brother’s party. Alcohol and blinding sunshine were a deadly combo. She closed her eyes, sipping casually on her mojito as afrobeats, the sound of crashing waves and the construction of the tent for the party later went underway.</p><p>Jen was right, this was the fucking life.</p><p>“I love this song!” Alice exclaimed a good while later.</p><p><em>BAILE INoLVIDABLE by Bad Bunny. </em></p><p>“I know,” Jen said, turning it up. “That’s why I put it on the playlist.”</p><p>“Rio!” Alice called.</p><p>The next thing she felt were hands.</p><p>“Get up! We’re dancing,” Alice told her.</p><p>Her best friend didn’t give her a chance to reply, pulling her up. The head rush was immediate. She swayed on the spot.</p><p>“Woah,” Rio got out, steadying herself.</p><p>Alice laughed, dragging each of their friends out of their sunbeds.</p><p>“Harkness, get your ass out here!” Natasha yelled.</p><p>It wasn’t long before her girlfriend joined them, her Abuela on her heels. Rio couldn’t help the giggle when her Abuela spun her before spinning Agatha.</p><p>“Mija, muéstrales tus pasos de salsa.” <em>Show them your salsa moves. </em>Her Abuela encouraged.</p><p>Rio shook her head. “No, necesito estar más borracho." <em>No, I need to be more drunk. </em></p><p>“Disparates.” <em>Nonsense. </em>Her Abuela replied, nudging Rio to demonstrate.</p><p>“What is she saying?” Natasha asked.</p><p>“She wants Rio to show us her salsa moves,” Lucia informed.</p><p>“Oh! Do it!”</p><p>“Yeah, go on, Ri!” Jen added.</p><p>“We all know you can dance, Fia. Don’t hold out on us now,” Agatha grinned.</p><p><em>Fia. </em></p><p>Only her family called her that, but technically, Agatha <em>was </em>family. Rio might as well add Vidal to the back of Agatha’s name. Each Vidal (minus her parents) had immediately accepted Agatha as one of their own. That wasn’t something they did, couldn’t be. When you’re royalty, you have to be cautious as to who you let into your life, but with Agatha, it hadn’t even been a question. It was just ‘Oh, you like Rio? We like you.’</p><p>“Look, I’ll help,” Alice said, starting to mimic playing the trumpets in time with the music.</p><p>Jen joined her, the couple acting as if they were a part of a full-on orchestra.</p><p>“I’ll take the pressure off,” Lucia announced, swaying her hips.</p><p>“¡Ayyy, vamos!” Alice smiled. “Venga, vamos. I don’t want to see anyone standing still.”</p><p>“¿Cuánto ha bebido?” <em>How much has she had to drink? </em>Her Abuela whispered.</p><p>“No sé.” <em>I don’t know. </em>Rio replied through a laugh.</p><p>Like Rio, Alice’s favourite day of the year was Carlos’s birthday. This was how she got. Rio loved to see it, her best friend, the shy, fearless leader that she was choosing this year every year to let loose.</p><p>It didn’t take long for the girls to find the rhythm. Natasha copied Lucia, Jen copied Alice, and Rio watched as her Abuela tried to teach Agatha simple steps.</p><p>“Uno, dos, uno, dos, sí,” when Agatha picked it up. “Fia,” her Abuela nodded towards her girlfriend.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes before extending a hand for Agatha to take. Her princesa accepted it gratefully. Agatha yelped when Rio spun her into her, heated skin against heated skin.</p><p>“Have I told you I love you in red?” Rio murmured into her ear as they swayed.</p><p>“Why do you think I’m wearing a red bikini?”</p><p>Rio smiled, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s cheek, then spinning her back out.</p><p>They joined hands again, Rio leading the way as she stepped to the right, then to the left. She watched her girlfriend, who watched their feet, trying to keep up.</p><p>“Eyes up here, love.”</p><p>Agatha huffed, blue eyes locking with brown. “Do you want me to fall on my face? I almost did when I was dancing with Ana.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I’d pay to see that.”</p><p>Agatha swept her foot under Rio’s, and she stumbled.</p><p>“Whoops.”</p><p>Rio pulled a face before yanking Agatha into her and lifting her off the ground.</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha said playfully as they spun.</p><p>“You’re lucky I’m not putting you in the sea.”</p><p>“Sod off!” Agatha replied, slapping at her.</p><p>Rio put her down, and they joined the others. She was forced into the middle as the girls chanted her name. Those chants turned into screams when Rio finally showed off her salsa steps.</p><p>“Ali,” Rio beckoned.</p><p>Her best friend joined her, and together, they danced, shimming their shoulders, rolling their bodies, swaying their hips.</p><p>“Lucia, vamos.”</p><p>Lucia did.</p><p>“¡Mis novias!” <em>Our girlfriends! </em>Agatha smiled, Alice’s camcorder out.</p><p>“You don’t get off that easily,” Rio replied, taking the camcorder and putting it down.</p><p>Simultaneously, they reached for their girls.</p><p>The next minutes were filled with laughter and dancing.</p><p>Rio genuinely couldn’t believe this was her life. She’d come so far. Nine months ago, it felt like her world had ended. She’d kissed a girl, and the entire planet had witnessed it. Then she’d lied and was forced to go to hell (London), but going to hell was the best thing that ever happened to her. Her mother had meant for it to be a punishment, and at first it had been. Now? Now she had a girlfriend and best friends who just happened to be in her favourite place with her.</p><p>“Lucia put me down!” Natasha laughed as Lucia ran towards the water with Natasha over her shoulder.</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha.</p><p>“Don’t you fucking dare-”</p><p>She cut herself off when Rio picked her up bridal style and shot towards the sea.</p><p>“Give up now, you can’t pick me up,” Rio heard Jen say from behind.</p><p>“Rio-Sofia Vidal, I swear to fucking god!” Agatha screamed when Rio pretended to drop her. “At least let me take off my jewellery.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, her gaze raking over the bracelets, rings, earrings and necklace on sunburnt tanned skin. “You think I’m gonna buy you fake gold? It’s waterproof.”</p><p>Agatha’s feet tangled just above the water.</p><p>“Okay…let me think of a better excuse then.”</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>Rio dropped her in the salt water.</p><p>“¡Puta!”</p><p>And then Agatha was dragging her under the waves.</p><p>The girls spent the rest of the afternoon playing in the sea, drinking away common sense and dancing with Rio’s Abuela.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Drunk as a mother fucking skunk.</p><p>That was the best way Agatha could think to describe the state she was in. She had no clue how she managed to get ready, actually, she did. Her girlfriend had done everything: washed her, dressed her, done her makeup whilst Agatha sipped on more mojitos.</p><p>Now she was dressed in her outfit for the evening, a long black lace dress with spaghetti straps, Rio beneath her in a black pinstriped suit, little silver diamonds dotted throughout, suit jacket open to reveal a black lace bra that matched her dress as she did up Agatha’s heels.</p><p>“I don’t know how you managed to do my hair and makeup as drunk as you are.”</p><p>Rio had added silver tinsel to her hair and silver eyeshadow to her eyes, topping it off with black eyeliner on her waterline and the neatest wings Rio had ever done.</p><p>“Years of practice,” Rio replied.</p><p>“This is how you and Alice turn up to Carlos’s party every year?” Agatha asked in alarm.</p><p>“Every two,” Rio corrected, tapping on her ankle so that she’d give Rio her other foot.</p><p>“Madre mía,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>Rio smiled. “Done. You ready?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, Rio catching her when she wobbled.</p><p>“Fuck. Me.”</p><p>“I will later. Let’s go,” Rio said, stealing a kiss.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Maybe if she were sober, she would appreciate the sight before her. That tent they’d been setting up on the beach earlier was more of a mini house. There were multiple rooms all decked out with ice sculptures, black and silver balloons hung from the ceiling alongside chandeliers, pyramids of glasses filled with champagne were on every corner beside buffets of food and clusters of tables and chairs were spread out sporadically. Not to mention the place was <em>packed. </em>How the hell did Carlos know so many people?</p><p>Speaking of…</p><p>“¡Ahí está!” <em>There he is! </em>Alice exclaimed when Carlos appeared in a white shirt revealing most of his chest, black slacks and black masquerade mask.</p><p>“¡Ali!” Carlos replied, pulling her into a bear hug.</p><p>“¡Feliz cumpleaños!” <em>Happy birthday! </em>Alice yelled over the noise.</p><p>“Muchas gracias,” Carlos said, releasing her.</p><p>“¡Feliz cumpleaños, hermano!” Rio told him, kissing his cheeks.</p><p>“Gracias, Fia.”</p><p>He mumbled something into Rio’s ear which made her roll her eyes.</p><p>The rest of the girls wished him happy birthday until it was Agatha’s turn.</p><p>“Gran discurso.” <em>Great speech. </em></p><p>Carlos smiled. “Muchas gracias. I wrote it all on my own,” he winked.</p><p>Agatha shoved him playfully before she kissed his cheeks. “Feliz cumpleaños,” she told him as they hugged.</p><p>“Gracias, hermana. Okay,” Carlos started when he pulled away. “Drink loads, have fun, come find me if you need anything.”</p><p>The girls nodded.</p><p>“Ciao,” Carlos said and left.</p><p>“Come meet my friends,” Rio whispered.</p><p>She nodded, and her girlfriend led her away.</p><p>She wished she were less drunk. This was important, wasn’t it? She was meeting the people Rio spent hours talking about, but Agatha was too drunk to remember names, let alone faces. They seemed like nice people, and they were trying to hold conversations with her, but the alcohol was making the Spanish get lost in translation.</p><p>Brown eyes coated in black eyeshadow behind a silver masquerade mask locked onto her, smiled.</p><p>“Do we need to cut you off?”</p><p>“Nuh uh,” Agatha replied petulantly. !Es…estoy bien!” <em>I…I’m fine! </em>Agatha got out.</p><p>“¿Y en Ingles?” <em>And in English? </em></p><p>Agatha pulled a face. “I’m fine.”</p><p>“She needs to dance it off,” Jen said from behind.</p><p>Agatha turned to see her best friend in her gold top and miniskirt hand in hand with Alice in a white suit.</p><p>“I could dance,” Natasha replied in her sparkly black dress that matched Lucia’s corset suit.</p><p>Rio held out a hand. “Vamos…or do you need me to say that in English?”</p><p>Agatha flipped her off as Rio took her to the dancefloor. “I can understand it’s just taking me a beat.”</p><p>“Sureee,” Rio teased then spun her.</p><p>“Okay, <em>slower! </em>I don’t wanna throw up.”</p><p>Rio laughed as <em>Rude Boy by Rihanna </em>blasted through the speakers. Her girlfriend didn’t hesitate to press her flush against her.</p><p>Bold.</p><p>Just as bold as holding her pinkie yesterday at dinner. Agatha was too drunk to question <em>why</em> Rio was feeling brave enough to touch her like this in front of people who most definitely didn’t know she was gay. They fell into that easy pattern they always did when they were drunk and dancing. Rio’s hand found a home on her waist, the other snaking up her body in lazy strokes.</p><p>So her girlfriend wanted them to fuck right here on this dancefloor? Agatha was game.</p><p>The hand on her waist bunched the material by her underwear, and Agatha felt one of Rio’s fingers brush against the hem. Like clockwork, her eyes rolled into the back of her head. Rio’s touch was like ecstasy, only heightened by the alcohol.</p><p>Fuck dancing like this, Agatha wanted to see the golden pools of brown that were her princess’s eyes reflecting off the yellow and silver disco lights. She turned, bit her lip when she locked onto them.  </p><p><em>God. </em></p><p>Rio-Sofia was fucking perfect.</p><p>Agatha pulled her into her, hands locking behind her neck.</p><p>“You okay, nena?”</p><p>“Soooo okay,” Agatha replied, earning her a smile.</p><p>Bold.</p><p>Agatha tugged Rio by her suit collar, drew her in and just before their lips touched, Rio’s gaze shifted. She huffed.</p><p>“Be back in a sec.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha replied, tried and failed to hide her disappointment.</p><p>That disappointment faded quickly, her friends surrounding and dancing with her.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>“I needed that,” Jen said, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand as they stood by the drinks table.</p><p>“Don’t know how you’re still wearing those,” Natasha nodded to her heels. “Took mine off four songs ago.”</p><p>Jen shrugged. “I was made for this.”</p><p>“Hey, where’s Rio?” Alice interjected.</p><p>It was then Agatha realised her girlfriend hadn’t come back.</p><p>“I don’t-”</p><p>Spanish filled her ears, cutting her off.</p><p>“It’s time for some slow dancing,” the DJ announced. “Grab yourself a partner and make your way to the dancefloor.”</p><p>“What’d he say?” Natasha asked.</p><p>“Slow dancing,” Agatha replied.</p><p>Natasha threw her hands up. “Great, where’s my girlfriend when I need her?”</p><p>“I was going to say the same thing,” Agatha mumbled.</p><p>Natasha sighed. “Come on then,” she said, looping her arm with Agatha’s. “We might as well watch.”</p><p>But Agatha didn’t want to <em>watch; </em>she wanted to dance with Rio.</p><p>They stood at the edge of the dancefloor with the rest of the losers who wouldn’t be dancing. <em>Say It Right by Nelly Furtado </em>wouldn’t have been Agatha’s first choice for a slow dance but hey, she wasn’t the one DJaying.</p><p>The couples started moving, but it seemed rehearsed, like this dance had been preplanned. Was there a dance she was supposed to learn? This looked straight out of Bridgerton. Every foot moved at the same time, every head. Maybe it was because she was drunk why she felt like she’d stepped onto a movie set.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m out,” Jen said, falling in line beside Agatha. “I can’t keep up.”</p><p>“You didn’t even try, babe,” Alice smiled, wrapping her arms around her.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze returned to the dancers.</p><p><em>‘You don’t mean nothing at all to me.’ </em></p><p>The lyrics said…but why was her brain trying to twist it, trying to make something out of nothing?</p><p><em>I’m drunk. </em></p><p>She needed the reminder.</p><p>There was one girl Agatha kept being drawn to. Maybe it was her height, the way her body moved, the colour of her hair. It reminded her of-</p><p>It wasn’t. This girl was wearing a long gold dress and mask; Rio was wearing a suit. Plus, she was dancing with a man.</p><p>The man spun the girl, dipped her, drew her close.</p><p><em>Is it her-?</em></p><p>No, the dancing was too intimate.</p><p>Sinking.</p><p>A sinking feeling began in Agatha’s chest and spread down to her stomach.</p><p><em>I’m drunk. </em></p><p>When she felt like she wanted to vomit.</p><p><em>Stop looking. </em></p><p>She pulled her eyes off the girl, tried to focus on <em>anything </em>else. Her gaze returned. It was her olive skin, what looked like a belly button piercing beneath the thin material of her dress, her slender fingers as she held onto the man she was dancing with.</p><p>Jen nudged her. “Is that the Queen?”</p><p>Agatha snapped her head in the direction Jen had indicated, and lo and behold.</p><p><em>‘You don’t mean nothing at all to me.’</em></p><p>Did she, to Rio?</p><p>Who the hell was she kidding to think they could exist in their own little bubble? That the <em>Queen of Spain </em>would have no influence on it, that Rio would all of a sudden break every rule in the book to be with her.</p><p>At the end of the day, her girlfriend was Rio-Sofia Vidal, second in line to the Spanish throne.</p><p>Her stomach twisted when the man the girl was dancing with ran his hand through her hair. Maybe she tried to pull back, maybe she batted his hand away, Agatha couldn’t tell.</p><p><em>‘But you’ve got what it takes to set me free.’ </em></p><p>Rio did. She could set Agatha free from all of this, the hiding, the secrets, the lies. She could let Agatha go and pretend none of this ever happened, and shouldn’t she? This wasn’t fucking fair!</p><p><em>You don’t know that’s her, you don’t know that’s her, you don’t-</em></p><p>Agatha thought she stopped breathing when the man kissed the girl. Maybe it was a peck, maybe it was the longest three seconds of her life, but when the girl pushed the man away, tears flooded Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>Rio held her mask, hand over her lips as if she couldn’t believe it. She was saying something to the man, and the man was saying something back.</p><p>“Aggs?”</p><p>Maybe Jen said her name, Agatha was, however, running.</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio called.</p><p>No fucking thoughts just getting the <em>fuck </em>out of there.</p><p>Tears blurred her vision as she stumbled across the beach, kicking up sand as she went. Her foot caught on her dress, and she fell. Hands grabbed her.</p><p>“Don’t touch me!” Agatha screamed, pushing Rio off her. She got to her feet, swiping at heavy tears. “What the fuck, Rio?!”</p><p>“Let me explain-”</p><p>“Explain what?! What’s there to fucking explain? That you let that man kiss you!”</p><p>Rio jerked her head back. “<em>Let him. </em>Is that what that looked like to you?”</p><p>In all honesty, Agatha didn’t know what it looked like.</p><p>“Let’s just calm down,” Rio tried to reason.</p><p>“No! No, I’m not-”</p><p><em>Pause, calm down. Don’t jump to any conclusions, hear her out- </em></p><p>“I’m not waiting for you!” Agatha blurted.</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows pinched. “What does that mean?”</p><p>“What I said,” Agatha snapped. “I’m not waiting for the promises to end, or the lies or the secrets. I refuse to be your dirty little secret!”</p><p>A tear slipped down Rio’s cheek. “You’re not,” she whispered.</p><p>“Then what am I then, huh? Because if I were your girlfriend, what happened in there.” Agatha pointed to the tent. “Wouldn’t have happened.”</p><p>“You don’t understand-”</p><p>Agatha threw her head back, cackling manically. “It’s the same fucking shit with you! ‘Let me explain, let’s just wait to tell my mum, tell the world.’</p><p>“But I told you,” Rio started, venom creeping into her own voice. “You deserve better than what I can offer you. I <em>said</em>, I told you to back out, and you fucking didn’t! Why?”</p><p>And the answer was so simple.</p><p>Agatha scoffed.</p><p>When Rio understood she wasn’t getting a reply, she continued. “I want to…everything I promised I want to do, and I will. But right now, we can’t-”</p><p>“No, <em>you </em>can’t.”</p><p>Rio’s face dropped.</p><p>“It’s all <em>you, </em>Rio-Sofia.”</p><p>She might as well have shot Rio by the way her body reacted when Agatha said her full name.</p><p>“I’m free to do what I want; you’re the one holding us back.”</p><p>Rio said nothing, her tears continuing to fall, the sound of the waves crashing harshly against the shore.</p><p><em>Don’t do this.

<p>That night. On a loop in Rio’s head for the past two weeks.</p><p><em>Agatha tugged her by her suit collar, drew her in and just before their lips touched, Rio’s gaze shifted. Lucia was beckoning her over, the movement rapid and urgent. </em></p><p><em>Rio huffed. “Be back in a sec.”</em></p><p><em>“Okay,” Agatha replied, tried and failed to hide her disappointment.</em></p><p><em>She left her girlfriend on the dancefloor, speeding up her walk the more frantic Lucia became. </em></p><p><em>“What is it, Cia?” </em></p><p><em>“Your mother.” </em></p><p><em>Rio’s stomach dropped. “What? Why is she here?” </em></p><p><em>Lucia shook her head. “I don’t know, but she told me to tell you to meet her outside.” </em></p><p>Oh, for fucksake.</p><p><em>“Alright.”</em></p><p><em>So first, Carlos had told her Mateo was there and </em>now <em>so was her mother? Seriously? Could she catch a fucking break? </em></p><p><em>Rio exited the tent, the cool night air hitting her skin the second she did. Waves crashing against the shore was notably louder than earlier. Was a storm brewing? She caught sight of her mother beside her Abuela’s house, arms folded, foot tapping impatiently. Rio turned her walk into a jog.</em></p><p><em>“Hello, mot-”</em></p><p><em>“You’re changing,” her mother announced when she arrived. </em></p><p>Not even a hello?</p><p><em>“What-?”</em></p><p><em>“There’s a dress waiting for you, follow me.” </em></p><p><em>“But why am I changing?” Rio asked, entering the house.</em></p><p><em>What was wrong with her suit? Yeah, okay, her entire stomach was out, and that belly button piercing she most definitely shouldn’t have was on show, but who cared? This was her brother’s party; he certainly wouldn’t. </em></p><p><em>“Mateo is here,” her mother said. </em></p><p><em>“So?” </em></p><p><em>The Queen spun on her. “I know you’re dating a woman.” </em></p><p><em>Rio froze, her insides clenching. </em></p><p><em>“I…what?” </em></p><p><em>The Queen scoffed. “You didn’t even have the decency to lie.” </em></p><p><em>Rio blinked, her mind racing. How? What? </em></p><p><em>“I will not allow it, Rio-Sofia.” </em></p><p><em>Just like that, her confusion vanished. The truth was out now, so who the fuck cared? </em></p><p><em>“Too bad.” </em></p><p><em>The Queen's glare turned to ice. </em></p><p><em>“Excuse me.” </em></p><p><em>“I said, ‘Too bad,’” Rio repeated. “I’ve told you on multiple occasions that I’m a lesbian; you have chosen to ignore me. That’s not my problem.” </em></p><p><em>A chill washed over Rio as her mother’s eyes narrowed, that glare unwavering as if she wanted to burn a hole through Rio’s skull. </em></p><p><em>“And I have told you that you are not.” </em></p><p><em>Rio gaped at her, her mouth opening and closing, trying to figure out what to get out first. </em></p><p><em>“You can’t tell me what I am, mother!” Rio bit out. “I’m gay! I’m fucking gay and I’m in love with the most amazing girl and if you just gave her a chance, you’d-”</em></p><p><em>“No,” was the curt reply. </em><em>“No, no, no. No daughter of mine is…” she couldn’t bring herself to finish the sentence. “I have no problem with that community. If that is how people choose to live, then so be it, but </em>you <em>will not be a part of it.” </em></p><p><em>And it was so fucking stupid, but tears glazed Rio’s eyes. </em></p><p><em>“I’m doing this for you, Rio-Sofia. What would Spain think?” </em></p><p><em>“Spain don’t give a flying fuck what my sexuality is! Half the world thinks I’m queer anyway!” </em></p><p><em>“They won’t respect you,” the Queen continued dismissively. “I can’t have that. You are second in line; you have young girls looking up to you. Think about what you’ll be teaching them.” </em></p><p><em>“I’ll be teaching them that love is not prototypical! That there isn’t one definition of it.” </em></p><p><em>The Queen’s eyebrows furrowed an inch. “That is the second time I’ve heard that today,” she muttered. “Where are you and your brother getting this notion from?” </em></p><p><em>“You heard Carlos’s speech?” </em></p><p><em>“Of course I did.” </em></p><p><em>“And you had no problem with it?” </em></p><p><em>“Of course I didn’t,” came the immediate reply. “As I have said, it is fine when other people do it, just not the royal family of Spain!” </em></p><p><em>The way she’d raised her voice, her mother didn’t do so often. </em></p><p><em>“We have a reputation to uphold, and you will ruin it if you continue with what you are doing. We are </em>good<em> Catholics.” </em></p><p><em>The first tear slipped down Rio’s face.</em></p><p><em>“I’m not even Catholic,” Rio whispered. “And being gay doesn’t make you a bad one.” </em></p><p><em>Her mother didn’t reply, just stared at her. </em></p><p><em>“We’ve been down this road before, don’t you remember?” The Queen spoke a moment later. “And I shipped you off to London. What did I always threaten next?” </em></p><p><em>Rio choked on the vomit climbing up her throat. </em></p><p><em>“No,” she breathed. </em></p><p><em>Her mother nodded. “Do not think for a second I won’t send you to conversion therapy, because I will.” </em></p><p><em>Who knew it would take one sentence for Rio’s world to come crashing down?</em></p><p><em>“Get. Dressed.” The Queen ordered through clenched teeth.</em></p><p><em>Rio didn’t argue, heading for the stairs on her left. </em></p><p><em>She sobbed as she took off her suit, replacing it with a gold long-sleeve dress. How had it all gone so wrong so quickly? Why did this keep happening to her? Couldn’t the universe give her </em>something<em>? Rio caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror, mascara running down her face, her smokey eyeshadow smudged. </em></p><p><em>A ruined princess. </em></p><p><em>That’s all she was. </em></p><p><em>As she wiped her makeup with makeup wipes, her Abuela poked her head around the door. It took mere moments for Rio to break down again. Her Abuela rushed to her aid, wrapping her arms around her. </em></p><p><em>“You’re okay, mija.” </em></p><p><em>“No,” Rio replied, shaking her head. “No, everything is…is falling apart.” </em></p><p><em>“You’ll fix it,” her Abuela told her, running her fingers through her hair. “You always do.” </em></p><p><em>No. Carlos always did. </em></p><p><em>What had Rio ever done on her own? Her mother was right. What would she do without her brother to fight her battles? </em></p><p><em>Lose. </em></p><p><em>She’d fucking lose. </em></p><p><em>“There’s no fixing this,” Rio replied, pulling back to wipe her tears. </em></p><p><em>“What makes you say that?” </em></p><p><em>Rio scoffed. “My mother.” </em></p><p><em>Her Abuela paused, studying her, and Rio turned away before she started crying again. </em></p><p><em>“Well, maybe she’s doing it because she loves you?” And she’d phrased it as a question. </em></p><p><em>A good one. Food for thought. </em></p><p><em>Did her mother love her? </em></p><p><em>It didn’t fucking feel like it.</em></p><p><em>“Do you know what happened?” Rio asked. </em></p><p><em>Her Abuela shook her head. </em></p><p><em>“If you did, I don’t think you’d say that.” </em></p><p><em>Her Abuela blinked, thrown.  </em></p><p><em>“What happened, Rio?” </em></p><p><em>Rio shook her head. “No. We can’t-”</em></p><p><em>“Rio-Sofia, are you ready?” Her mother’s voice sounded. </em></p><p><em>Rio threw her makeup wipe in the bin. “Yeah.” </em></p><p><em>“Rio-”</em></p><p><em>“I’m fine, Abuela.” </em></p><p><em>Her grandmother knew she was lying, but nodded anyway. </em></p><p><em>“Then let’s go,” the Queen instructed. </em></p><p><em>“You will dance with Mateo,” her mother ordered as they returned to the beach. “He is a good man and will make an even better husband.” </em></p><p><em>It was white nose. Everything her mother said went in one ear and out the other. How would she explain this to Agatha? </em></p><p><em>“I ensured only the best men this country has to offer could be eligible bachelors for you, and do you know why?” </em></p><p><em>She’d been so close to having everything.</em></p><p><em>“Because I love you, Rio-Sofia.” </em></p><p><em>That ripped Rio out of her thoughts. </em></p><p><em>“Pardon?” </em></p><p><em>“I love you,” the Queen nodded as if it were the only truth in the world. “My parents didn’t care whether the man I married was good for me, just if he’d be good for Spain.” </em></p><p><em>Was Rio hearing right? Was her mother trying to justify this? </em></p><p><em>“I got lucky with your father, but I may not have. Mateo is </em>good, <em>I promise. We did the research-”</em></p><p><em>“Stop talking!” Rio yelled. “I’m doing as you ask! Don’t you dare try to justify this to me because it’s fucked up!” </em></p><p><em>The Queen blinked, taken aback, before nodding. </em></p><p><em>Rio went to leave when her mother’s voice stopped her. </em></p><p><em>“The necklace, Rio-Sofia.” </em></p><p><em>Rio’s hand flew to the silver chain, the ‘A’ hanging off it, her most prized possession. The tears threatened to return, but she sucked in a breath, reigning them back in. With trembling hands, she unclasped the necklace, hesitated, dropped it into her mother’s outstretched hand. </em></p><p><em>“Give it back,” Rio snapped. </em></p><p><em>It was the last thing she said before she disappeared into the tent. </em></p><p>The following events only added to the nightmare. Mateo, dancing with him, him <em>kissing </em>her without any fucking warning.</p><p><em>“I’m sorry. I thought there was a vibe,” he said when Rio pushed him off. </em></p><p><em>“There wasn’t!” </em></p><p><em>“I’m so sorry, Rio-Sofia,” Mateo repeated. “I read the situation wrong. I-”</em></p><p><em>His words faded to nothing when Rio caught sight of Agatha. The look on her face. Rio would never forget it. </em></p><p><em>“Agatha!” Rio called as her girlfriend fled. </em></p><p><em>Carlos jumped in then, shoving at Mateo the same time Rio ran to chase Agatha. </em></p><p>It had been one of the worst nights of Rio’s life, and that was saying something. She’d been threatened with conversion therapy, kissed by a man, and broken up with all in the span of an hour.</p><p>She truly was in hell.</p><p>They hadn’t spoken since. Agatha spent her last day in Spain avoiding her and hadn’t responded to the dozen messages Rio sent over the past two weeks. Would she avoid her now on the day she returned to London? There was so much Rio had to explain, and it wasn’t fucking fair that Agatha wasn’t giving her the chance to do so.</p><p>“You ready?” Lucia asked as they pulled up to her accommodation.</p><p>After spending her days moping around the palace with Carlos, Ana and Alice trying every trick in the book to cheer her up, she was. The only thing that could lighten up Rio’s mood was fixing things with Agatha.</p><p>She nodded, and they got out of the car.</p><p>The lift was broken like it typically was and Rio realised as she climbed the stairs that she was <em>scared</em>. How the actual fuck was she supposed to go about this situation? If, and that was a big <em>if, </em>Agatha let her explain, could they be together? Her ex-girlfriend made it clear she had no interest in being hidden anymore, and Rio would never ask her to do so, but she didn’t want to lose Agatha.</p><p>She’d rather die.</p><p>But conversion therapy…Rio didn’t know if she could survive that.</p><p>Just before she tapped her keycard on her flat door, the door beside her swung open. Rio caught a flash of red hair before Natasha pounced on Lucia.</p><p>“Ooof!” Lucia laughed, catching Natasha on her hips.</p><p>Natasha didn’t hesitate to plant a deep kiss on her lips.</p><p>“Missed you,” Natasha smiled when they broke apart.</p><p>“Missed you too,” Lucia replied.</p><p>She put her girlfriend down, and Natasha whispered something into her ear.</p><p>“No, baby. I’m working.”</p><p>Natasha tugged on her suit collar, drawing her closer. “<em>Please</em>.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Rio interrupted. “You can hang out.”</p><p>Lucia shook her head. “No Rio-”</p><p>“It’s fine, Cia. I’m not going anywhere. Have fun, seriously.”</p><p>“I-”</p><p>“I love you, Ri,” Natasha cut in before dragging Lucia into her flat.</p><p>Rio smiled.</p><p>At least they were happy.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Yeah…so Agatha had fucked up.</p><p>Now that she wasn’t completely off her face, she could recall the night accurately. Rio hadn’t <em>let him </em>like Agatha accused her of; the man had kissed her girlfriend without permission. In the moment, it was so easy to believe that Rio just let it happen. That was fucked. Agatha was fucked for thinking it.</p><p>The pain, betrayal and alcohol overrode any logical thinking, and no, that wasn’t an excuse.</p><p>To add salt to the wound, she’d broken up with Rio. Why <em>the fuck </em>had she done that? Her girlfriend needed her, and Agatha, like she always fucking did, ran. Thrown biting words in Rio’s face and ignored her for the rest of the Easter Holidays.</p><p>An avoidant to her core.</p><p>Every time a message came in, she wanted to respond, but her body physically wouldn’t allow her to. The weight of what she’d done, the guilt, the shame, it was all too much. She’d rather be the source of her own demise than face herself, face Rio.</p><p>She missed her princess so much.</p><p>Agatha’s ears perked up when she heard her flat door open and close. On instinct, she ran her thumb over the <em>R.S. </em>sewn in dark green thread on the cuff of Rio’s grey <em>Carhartt</em> hoodie. She’d worn it every day since she returned from Spain.</p><p>It no longer smelled of Rio.</p><p>She wore it anyway.</p><p>The shuffling next door was immediate the second Rio entered her room. A sweat broke across Agatha’s forehead.</p><p>It was time to talk.</p><p>Nervousness was an understatement as she left her room and headed for Rio’s. It crashed down on her all at once when she laid eyes on her girlfriend’s door. How she’d have to communicate, and own up to what she’d done, and <em>apologise. </em> </p><p>“Fuckkkk,” Agatha muttered, throwing her head back.</p><p>How she hated doing all three of those things.</p><p><em>Just do it, just knock. </em></p><p>She raised a hand to do so, hesitated, dropped it.</p><p><em>Just do it! </em></p><p>She repeated the action, dropped her hand again.</p><p>They could talk later, right?</p><p><em>Yes, we can. </em></p><p>She turned to leave.</p><p><em>Stop being a little bitch! </em></p><p>Yeah…</p><p>“Okay, okay, okay,” she mumbled. “This is easy, it’s just Rio.”</p><p>It was just Rio.</p><p>She lifted her hand the same time the door swung open.</p><p>Deep blue locked with dark brown.</p><p>A thousand memories, a thousand thoughts.</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows pinched as she took Rio in. It was her dark hair in its loose waves, her radiant olive skin, her clothes, a baggy blue button-up and navy cargo trousers. Her full lips, her stack of silver earrings, her-</p><p> ‘A’ necklace. Rio wore it even now.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help the slow smile that spread across her face. Rio couldn’t help hers either.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha breathed.</p><p>“Hola,” was the reply.</p><p>That smile stayed firmly in place.</p><p>She lowered her head, fiddling with her jeans belt loop.</p><p>“I…erm…we should talk.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Not here.”</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. “Why-?”</p><p>“You trust me?”</p><p>And the reply was easy.</p><p>“Always.”</p><p>“Then come on,” Rio beckoned.  </p><p>Agatha didn’t question it, following Rio out of the flat. She did, however, question her girlfriend when they walked outside. The sky was painted in the most wonderful colours, bright pink, orange, yellow.</p><p>“Why are we-?”</p><p>“No more questions,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha kept quiet.</p><p>Her curiosity spiked once again when they entered Euston Station. She said nothing as they headed down the escalator, through the barriers and into the underground. She said nothing as they got onto the Victoria line to Oxford Circus, changed to the Bakerloo line (she contemplated saying something when they did; Agatha despised the Bakerloo line), and got off at Piccadilly Circus.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha finally said when they stopped in the centre of it all.</p><p>The large billboards flashed with their vibrant ads beside her, and the buzz of the capital was so evident. Street performers played their tunes or performed their shows before large crowds.</p><p>“What are we doing here?”</p><p>“Talk,” Rio encouraged.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “Here?” She asked over the noise.</p><p>“Mhm,” Rio nodded. “Talk.”</p><p>Agatha whipped her head around, eyes tracking the multiple people who walked past.</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>Rio nodded again.</p><p>“Erm…okay.”</p><p>This was a million times harder than having a private discussion behind closed doors.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha began. “After what happened at Carlos’s party, I shouldn’t have…you needed me, and I ran…” she paused then added, “And broke up with you.”</p><p>“Yeah, fuck you for that,” Rio said playfully.</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Shut up! I’m trying to apologise here.”</p><p>Rio laughed.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have done that,” Agatha continued. “I also shouldn’t have thrown all that stuff in your face. I know it’s not your fault, and yet I blamed you anyway-”</p><p>A car horn blaring interrupted her.</p><p>Agatha huffed. “Are we sure we can’t do this at home?”</p><p>“Nope, continue.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “If you insist on making this difficult for me-”</p><p>“Go on,” Rio urged.</p><p>Because she knew Agatha was stalling.</p><p>She cleared her throat. “I guess this is all to say that…erm…I’m…I’m okay with being a secret.”</p><p>Rio’s head jerked, blinking rapidly as if she couldn’t believe the words.</p><p>Another thing Agatha realised during their weeks apart.</p><p>Maybe a small part of her would hate herself for it. Being hidden went against everything she valued, but for Rio-Sofia, Agatha would genuinely do anything. The feelings she felt for Rio overrode logic. It wasn’t something she’d be able to explain; she didn’t even understand it herself, all she knew was that this was it for her.</p><p>Rio was.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Agatha dropped her head, took a deep breath, and forced out:</p><p>“Because I love you.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched.</p><p>“Because I want you in every way you could want a person and always will.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes rimmed with tears.</p><p>“So there’s no point breaking up or me trying to convince myself that this isn’t worth it because it is, you are.”</p><p>Rio parted her lips to speak, but Agatha stopped her.</p><p>“I know what you’re going to say, that I haven’t thought this through and that I deserve better than what you can offer me, but-”</p><p>Silenced with a kiss.</p><p>Rio kissed her in front of the world.</p><p>Agatha blinked a couple of times, closed her eyes and let herself get lost in it.</p><p>She felt movement, Rio bringing her hand up to clutch her heart like she often did, and this time Agatha’s hand joined it, clasping her fingers around Rio’s.</p><p>When Rio pulled back, tears stained her cheeks.</p><p>“I love you too.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, pressing their foreheads together.</p><p>“You don’t have to hide anymore,” Rio told her. “You’re done with that; you’ll never have to do so again.”</p><p>“What’s changed?” Agatha murmured.</p><p>“Me. I don’t want to put you in that position.”</p><p>“But your mum, Spain-”</p><p>“Fuck em,” Rio said through a wet laugh. “I’ll deal with the consequences.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows furrowed at that.</p><p>“And what are they?”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “It’s worth it.”</p><p>Panic bubbled up through Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“No, Rio.” She stepped back. “What are they?”</p><p>Rio shook her head again. “Please don’t, just-”</p><p>She moved into Agatha’s orbit again.  </p><p>“Just know that I love you, even if I’m not around to say it.”</p><p>And now tears pricked Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>“What are you saying-”</p><p>“Let me have this,” Rio interjected. “<em>Please</em>. Let’s just live in the now.”</p><p>“You can’t just ask me to-”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said firmly. “I can. We love each other, that’s all that matters. Promise me you’ll forget about everything except us for right now.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked between Rio’s as she took in her pleading face.  </p><p>“…Okay.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio echoed.</p><p>Rio grabbed her hand then. “Tonight, we’re tourists.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Show me what London has to offer, baby.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Alright then.”</p><p>She spent the rest of the night taking Rio to every landmark. Big Ben, the London Eye, Tower Bridge, the Shard, and at every one, Rio would stop to kiss her, didn’t hesitate to lace their fingers together.</p><p>Was this true happiness?</p><p>Showing the girl you love, the city you love?</p><p>Agatha thought so.</p><p>It was around midnight when the girlfriends returned to the flat, and at around 23:45, Rio’s phone started blowing up.</p><p>Rio huffed. “I gotta deal with this,” she said, pulling out her phone from her pocket.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip. “Or…you could deal with it in the morning? What happened to being present?”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Stop using my words against me.” She kissed her. “I’ll come into your room when I’m done. Don’t pout.” When Agatha did. “I love you.”</p><p>Three stupid little words, and yet Agatha’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>“I love you too.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Agatha blinked awake, the sun trying and failing to break through her black out curtains.</p><p>“What the hell?” She croaked, scratching her head.</p><p>It was then she realised something was <em>off. </em>There was no warmth, no smell of lavender, no arms wrapped around her. Rio never came into her room? The last thing she remembered was waiting up for her; in the time between now and then, she must’ve fallen asleep.</p><p>She knocked on the wall beside her, waited for a response…</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows, pushing off her duvet and heading for her door.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha called, knocking. “You up?”</p><p>A door opened but it wasn’t her girlfriend’s.</p><p>Alice appeared, tears falling in streams.</p><p>She uttered one single sentence, and Agatha’s world came crashing down.</p><p>“She’s gone, Aggs.”</p>

She shook her head, “No, that can’t be true. It’s the fucking <em>Daily Mail</em>. They report fake news all the time.”</p><p>Alice sniffed. “Then why is Rio gone, Aggs?”</p><p>“I-”</p><p><em>I’ll deal with the consequences. </em></p><p>Consequences…</p><p><em>Just know that I love you, even if I’m not around to say it.</em></p><p>That motherfucker.</p><p>Agatha bolted to her room, Alice on her tail.</p><p>“Aggs? Wh-”</p><p>Agatha held up a hand for silence as she dialled. The call went straight to voicemail. She tried again. Same result.</p><p>“No, no, no,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>Had her girlfriend got herself sent to conversion therapy just so she wouldn’t have to hide? That’s what was threatened next, that’s why Wanda blackmailing Rio was so fucked up, that’s why they had to be a secret.</p><p>Rio had sacrificed <em>everything </em>just for her.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Why couldn’t her girlfriend be selfish for one goddamn minute?!</p><p>“Have you seen Lucia?”</p><p>Alice shook her head. “I assumed she’d be gone with-”</p><p>She didn’t let Alice finish her sentence, dashing out of her room to pound on the flat next door.</p><p>“Nat!” Agatha called. “Nat!”</p><p>The door swung open, and Natasha looked just as panicked as Alice had been.</p><p>“You’ve seen it?” Alice asked.</p><p>“Seen what?” Jen jumped in, materialising next to them in the hallway.</p><p>Alice gave Jen her phone the same time Natasha said:</p><p>“Lucia’s phone started blowing up, and then she said she had to go.”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Jen said, her hand covering her mouth. “Is this true?”</p><p>“We don’t-”</p><p>“No!” Agatha cut in. “No, it’s not true.”</p><p>“Then where are they, Aggs?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t want to think about where they might be.</p><p>“I tried calling Lucia, but it went straight to voicemail.”</p><p>“Same with Rio,” Agatha added.</p><p>“Then what do we do?” Alice whispered, her tears falling.</p><p>The girls turned to look at her.</p><p>Right, because she was Agatha fucking Harkness, and she always had the solution for everything.</p><p>“I…” Agatha trailed off.</p><p>Not this time. This time, Agatha didn’t have a clue in the fucking world.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Rio’s phone wouldn’t stop going off, not a single message giving any context.</p><p><em>Pick up the phone, Rio-Sofia. </em></p><p><em>Fia, when are you coming home? </em></p><p><em>Mija, please ring someone back and let them know you’re okay. </em></p><p><em>Rio, answer your phone, sweetheart. </em></p><p><em>RIO-SOFIA ANSWER YOUR PHONE THIS INSTANT! </em></p><p>Thirty missed calls.</p><p>The thirty-first from her mother breaking through the iMessage notifications.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>Was that a sigh of relief she heard on the other end?</p><p>“Are you okay?” Her mother asked softly.</p><p>Her mother hadn’t spoken to her like that in a long time.</p><p>“…Yes, why?”</p><p>Her mother paused. “Nothing,” she finally said. “You’re coming home now.”</p><p>Rio was expecting this. A photo of her and Agatha had most definitely reached her mother by now. She cursed the internet for being so fast.</p><p>“Look,” Rio began. “I know-”</p><p>“Rio-Sofia, we don’t have time for this. We’ll talk when you’re home.”</p><p>The line went dead.</p><p>Great.</p><p>Her mother wasn’t even going to hear her out.</p><p>Lucia burst into her room then.</p><p>“We gotta go,” she urged.</p><p>Rio shook her head, tears pricking her eyes. “Cia, please don’t make me. I don’t want to go.”</p><p>Sympathy washed over Lucia’s face. “Don’t be scared. It’ll be okay.”</p><p>What about going to conversion therapy would be okay?</p><p>“Come on, Rio,” Lucia nodded to the door.</p><p>Rio stared unmoving.</p><p>“Don’t make this hard, <em>please. </em>If you don’t come with me, you know your mother’s going to send someone ten times worse.”</p><p>A chill washed over Rio at the thought.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>She contemplated saying goodbye to Agatha, decided against it. What would be the point? It’d end in tears and more heartbreak, and Rio wanted to go out on a high note.</p><p><em>I love you too. </em></p><p>Agatha’s last words to her.</p><p>She’d like to keep it that way.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Agatha couldn’t be in the flat.</p><p>All they did was wait around for a reliable news source to report the car crash. Agatha knew it wasn’t true. She knew where Rio had gone. Still, some part of her hoped that her girlfriend would pick up the phone, explain the situation and tell her she’d be back soon.</p><p>Maybe Rio had gone out for breakfast.</p><p>Maybe she’d gone for a walk.</p><p>Maybe she had some princess duty she needed to attend to.</p><p>Agatha decided she’d skip university today because who the fuck cared, right? Her princess was fucking missing. She found herself on Primrose Hill like she always did when she needed an escape. The wind blew the stray strands of her Dutch braids as she sat cross-legged with <em>The Handmaid’s Tale </em>in her lap and AirPods on full volume.</p><p>She’d read it more times than she could count. It was the layers behind every word, the messages to decode, the context of the book in today’s world that made her so drawn to it. It was easy to let her mind get stuck in it, to analyse and pick apart every sentence than think about what was going on in her own life.</p><p>She’d shown Rio once.</p><p><em>“Say it again,” Rio asked from beside her on the bed. </em></p><p><em>“Nolite te bastardes carbourn-dorum.” </em></p><p><em>“Don’t let the bastards grind you down?” </em></p><p><em>Agatha scoffed. “Of course, you know Latin.” </em></p><p><em>Rio shrugged. “Had to learn at school.” </em></p><p><em>Agatha scoffed again. “Course.” </em></p><p><em>“And what’s the deeper meaning?” </em></p><p><em>“Well, it was like a secret message between the handmaids. Offred discovered the writing on the floor of her wardrobe where no one else would look. The previous handmaid was telling her not to give up.” </em></p><p><em>“I thought the previous handmaid killed herself,” Rio pointed out. “Wasn’t that giving up?” </em></p><p><em>Agatha tilted her head back and forth. “Debatable. Did she give up, or did she want an escape?” </em></p><p><em>Rio quirked a brow. </em></p><p><em>“Point is,” Agatha continued. “It was unity when the theocracy wanted to divide them. Sure, it was a small gesture, but it was the best she could do.”</em></p><p><em>“Nolite te bastardes carbourn-dorum,” Rio echoed. </em></p><p><em>“Mhm.” </em></p><p><em>She watched Rio as she pondered the words. </em></p><p><em>“Don’t you ever stop fighting for what you believe in. Don’t give up,” Agatha told her. </em></p><p>Tears splattered onto the worn pages.</p><p>Agatha hoped Rio remembered that now, wherever she was.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>The rain beat down on her as she stepped onto the airport concrete, the first glints of daylight peeking out on the horizon. Lucia ushered Rio into the car waiting for them, and the driver sped off the second the doors snapped shut.</p><p>At the end of the day, Rio would end up in hell.</p><p>Her phone had been taken by one of her security guards, and nobody would answer her when she asked what was happening. She knew, wanted the confirmation. Why was everyone being so secretive? It was clear her mother only wanted to add to the punishment by making her sit in suspense.</p><p>That anxiety she knew all too well started creeping into her system. It was the constant fidgeting, the nail biting, the pulling at her hair. She knew better than to dig her nails into her palms. She made a promise to her girlfriend and wouldn’t be breaking it, especially not now.</p><p>Would she ever see Agatha again?</p><p>The thought had her choking on a sob.</p><p>She would do yesterday all over again, kissing Agatha in the middle of London, running around with her afterwards, all of it, everything, if it meant her girlfriend didn’t have to hide.</p><p>Rio loved her too much to watch her suffer.</p><p>She was, however, shocked when Agatha confessed she was willing to keep being a secret. It went against who she was as a person. As Rio always said, her girlfriend was so unapologetically, shamelessly herself.</p><p>They’d both been willing to make sacrifices, Rio realised. It was only she who had to pay the price.</p><p>She’d do it again.</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows when they pulled up to the palace an hour or so later. This wasn’t some remote undisclosed location…this was home.</p><p>Lucia opened the car door, and Rio climbed out.</p><p>“Get some sleep, princess.”</p><p>“What’s going on, Cia?”</p><p>Lucia shook her head. “Goodnight.”</p><p>Rio huffed. “Night,” she mumbled, stepping inside.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>This had to be a nightmare.</p><p>Of course it was. This was the tiresome cycle of restless sleep and consciousness that Rio had found herself in all night. She just had to wait for the next time she woke up.</p><p>Her brother was not in an intensive care unit in a private hospital. He wasn’t hooked up to various machines working relentlessly to keep his body alive. He wasn’t…</p><p>Nope.</p><p>A nightmare.</p><p>The worst fucking nightmare of Rio’s life.</p><p>She pinched herself, forcing herself to wake up.</p><p>“Stop it, Fia,” Ana whispered, tears staining her cheeks.</p><p>But she couldn’t stop otherwise she wouldn’t wake up.</p><p>Rio pinched herself again.</p><p>“Fia!” Ana croaked. “<em>Stop it.” </em></p><p>Rio swallowed, her attention turning to the doctor speaking with her parents.</p><p>But this was a nightmare…wasn’t it?</p><p align="center">***</p><p>This was entirely Agatha’s fault.</p><p>The TV flashed before her eyes as the girls sat huddled together on the sofa in Natasha’s flat. Aerial shots of a wrecked red <em>Ferrari</em> in the streets of Madrid played on a loop as the BBC news reporter voiced over the clips.</p><p>“<em>At around 23:00, first in line to the Spanish throne, Prince Carlos Vidal, was reported to be in a car crash.” </em></p><p>Alice choked, and Jen drew her girlfriend into a hug.</p><p><em>“Two black SUVS were seen chasing the Princes in the late hours of the night, inevitably forcing him into a construction bin on the side of the street. Although the potential suspects have not been found, we know they are a part of a far-right group – the ERS – who have been vocal about their disapproval of the Prince’s speech at AmorUno (LoveOne) charity on his twenty-third birthday.” </em></p><p>As Agatha said, entirely her fault.</p><p>She should’ve said no to helping write the speech, should’ve said, ‘No, Rio wouldn’t like it if you spoke at the event.’ She’d have regrets, but it would be better than Carlos being in a…</p><p><em>“It has been reported that the Prince is in critical condition and in a coma. The Spanish Royal Family is yet to comment.” </em></p><p>“This is fucked,” Natasha muttered.</p><p>Understatement of the fucking century.</p><p>“I just…” Alice sniffed. “I just can’t help thinking about poor Ana…and…and <em>Rio</em>.”  </p><p>“I can’t even imagine what they’re going through,” Jen chimed in.</p><p>“Has anyone spoken to Rio?” Natasha asked.</p><p>Maybe the girls were looking at her.</p><p>Where did Agatha even begin to process this?</p><p>She’d spent the entire day sick to her stomach, worried that her girlfriend had been sent to conversion therapy when actually, her brother was in a coma, critical condition, hadn’t woken up.</p><p>She felt everything and nothing.</p><p>“Aggs?”</p><p>Maybe Jen said her name.</p><p>“I just…” Agatha trailed off. “I just need a minute.”</p><p>She got up, her body moving without her brain's instruction. Somehow, she was in the corridor, and then every emotion hit her at once.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t stop the vomit that climbed up her throat and spewed out.</p><p>Jen was by her side immediately.</p><p>“You’re okay,” Jen said, pulling her hair out of her face.</p><p>Agatha heaved, and her sick splattered into the bucket that appeared beneath her feet.</p><p>“Let it out, babe,” Jen soothed, rubbing her back as Agatha knelt by the bucket.</p><p>Tears tumbled into it alongside the next round of sick.</p><p><em>Everything’s gone so wrong. </em></p><p><em>Rio. </em></p><p><em>This is my fault. </em></p><p><em>Rio. </em></p><p><em>Will Carlos die? </em></p><p><em>Rio. </em></p><p>Agatha thought her insides would come out. The vomiting felt never-ending as her friends whispered comforting words and offered comforting touches.</p><p>Oh…how this was all so incredibly fucked.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Rio didn’t know what time it was, just that the sun was long gone. The night sky kept her company as she held her brother’s hand and prayed to whatever deity that would listen that he would wake soon.</p><p>He had a bandage wrapped around his head, his right arm was in a cast, and he had bruises on his face. She wiped angrily at a tear. She’d spent the day crying, and she was sick of it. Why couldn’t Carlos just wake up?!</p><p>“Please, Carlos,” Rio whispered into the silence. “I know you can hear me. I can’t do this without you, so just WAKE THE FUCK UP!” Rio screamed.</p><p>Her parents shot into the room then, their disappointment evident when they were met with a still unconscious Carlos.</p><p>“Rio,” her father said softly. “I think you should join your sister at home.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, wiping at yet another tear. “No. I’m not leaving him.”</p><p>Her father frowned, and Rio turned her attention back to her brother.</p><p>This was her fucking fault.</p><p>Why had she mentioned the charity? Why hadn’t she figured out what Carlos was planning and stopped him from doing it? This should be her. She should’ve been the one to speak, to stand up for herself. Why did she always let Carlos defend her? When was she going to start defending herself?</p><p>“Mija,” her father said, placing a gentle hand on Rio’s shoulder that made her flinch. “The doctors say that the brain d…that your brother might not wake up.”</p><p>Rio’s body went rigid.</p><p><em>Not wake up…</em></p><p>That didn’t make any sense.</p><p>“Well, the doctors don’t know what they’re talking about,” Rio sniped. “They don’t know him.”</p><p>Rio squeezed Carlos’s limp hand, urging him now more than ever to wake up and prove the idiot fucking professionals wrong.</p><p>“Right…” her father continued. “Because your brother never specified what he would like to happen to him if he were ever put in this unfortunate position, the decision has fallen to your mother and I.”</p><p>“What decision?” Rio asked.</p><p>Her father paused. “We have decided that if…if it’s too much to keep him alive, then we’ll let the doctors withdraw treatment.”</p><p><em>Withdraw treatment…</em></p><p>“What does that mean?”</p><p>She knew exactly what it meant.</p><p>“It means he will die, Rio-Sofia.”</p><p>Rio snapped her head in her mother’s direction.</p><p>How the <em>fuck </em>could she just say that? No warning, no easing into it, just ‘Oh, we’re going to kill your brother.’</p><p>“You wouldn’t fucking dare,” Rio seethed. “Are you that heartless? He is your son!”</p><p>The Queen stared at her, her mask of neutrality always so firmly in place.</p><p>“It won’t be good for Spain,” her mother continued. “For them to be at unease waiting for Carlos’s recovery.”</p><p>“Spain?!” Rio shouted, getting up. “Who the fuck cares about Spain? Think about us! No, think about Carlos! Again, your fucking son!”</p><p>“Fia, let’s not use that language,” her father told her.</p><p>“Tell her she’s sick!” Rio continued. “Tell your wife she’s sick in the fucking head for trying to take <em>my </em>brother, Ana’s.”</p><p>“I’m thinking of Spain,” the Queen stated.</p><p>No, it was about image.</p><p>A prince in a coma sounds pathetic; better for Carlos to be dead.</p><p>“If you do this, I will <em>hate </em>you forever,” Rio got out as her tears fell.</p><p>Her mother nodded, sympathy flashing across her eyes before it disappeared again.</p><p>Panic consumed Rio then, the weight of what her parents were saying finally setting in.</p><p>She could lose her brother.</p><p>“Mami,” Rio pleaded. “Don’t do this. Don’t take him from me.”</p><p>“Let’s get you home, mija,” her father encouraged.</p><p>“Just tell me you won’t pull the plug if it comes down to it,” Rio said.</p><p>The hospital room door opened, and this time, one of Rio’s bodyguards came in.</p><p>“Take her home, Lorenzo,” her mother instructed.</p><p>Rio shook her head. “No. No, I’m not leaving, not until you answer me.”</p><p>Lorenzo locked eyes with her mother, who nodded. He took a step forward as Rio stepped back, stumbling and landing on her unconscious brother. Carlos’s body jolted, but he remained asleep.</p><p>“Carlos, wake up!” Rio screamed.</p><p>She was ripped from his arms, her feet lifting off the ground when her security guard picked her up. Rio tried to fight him, but she was no match for the seven-foot man.</p><p>“Mami!” Rio cried, her voice echoing off the hospital walls she was being carried down. “Don’t do this! <em>Please </em>don’t do this! Don’t take him from me!”</p><p>Her throat began to burn the louder she shrieked.</p><p>“You’ll kill us both if you do this!”</p><p>Because a part of her would die with her brother.</p><p>She was put into a waiting vehicle en route to the palace. The tears never stopped falling, and neither did the thoughts.</p><p><em>What if they kill him? </em></p><p><em>What if Carlos doesn’t wake up? </em></p><p><em>What about Ana? </em></p><p><em>What about me? </em></p><p><em>What if he never wakes up? </em></p><p><em>What does this mean for the Spanish throne? </em></p><p>And then it hit her.</p><p>If Carlos didn’t wake up, she would no longer be Rio-Sofia, second in line to the Spanish throne…</p><p>She’d be first.</p>

<p>Three knocks on her bedroom door.</p><p>“Rio-Sofia?”</p><p>Rio pushed at damp pillows to sit up, her head pounding from the hours spent crying, lack of sleep and dehydration.</p><p>“Are you awake, mija?”</p><p>This was another nightmare then. Rio hadn’t been spoken to this way by her in years.</p><p>“Y…yeah,” Rio croaked.</p><p>The sooner she let this scenario play out, the sooner she could wake up from it.</p><p>Her mother entered the room accompanied by one of their maids. The Queen nodded for the tray of food and tea to be put on Rio’s bed before she dismissed her. The maid bowed and left. Rio furrowed her eyebrows. When was the last time the Queen did this? She’d been wrong; her brain wasn’t plaguing her with a nightmare and instead was giving her some respite with this fairy dreamland sequence.</p><p>“May I please sit?” Her mother asked.</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything, just gestured to her bed.</p><p>When her mother got comfortable, she said:</p><p>“How are you feeling this morning?”</p><p>“Like shit,” Rio replied bluntly.</p><p>Her mother nodded. “You will do; you haven’t been eating. You must look after yourself, Rio-Sofia, princesses-”</p><p>Rio groaned, flopping back on her pillows.</p><p>So much for fairy dreamland.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” the Queen apologised. “I didn’t come in here to-”</p><p>“What did you come in here for then, huh? All you ever do is scream at me, and right now, I’m not in the mood!” Rio yelled, winced when the volume caused pain to shoot through her skull.</p><p>“What is it, mija?” Her mother asked.</p><p>Rio flinched when her mother placed a gentle hand on her and started rubbing soothingly. For the third time this morning, Rio was out of her mind confused. Could her brain pick one? Was this a nightmare or a dream? She didn’t have time for the head fuckery!</p><p>A sob forced its way out, and Rio flinched again when her mother pulled her into her arms. She felt like a piece of cardboard against her mother’s cold body until she gave in, melting into her embrace. Rio let her head rest on her shoulder as the Queen ran her hand through her hair.</p><p>“It’s okay, Rio-Sofia,” her mother soothed.</p><p>“None of this is okay, <em>mami</em>.”</p><p>Old habits.</p><p>“But it will be.”</p><p>And yet her mother hadn’t scolded her for it.</p><p>Rio wrapped her arms around her mother, squeezed her tight. It could be another decade before they hugged like this again. She had to make it count. Dark brown eyes locked with dark brown as her mother wiped at her tears.</p><p>“I do not tell you this enough, but you are so strong.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes at that. They were having a nice moment; her mother didn’t need to ruin it by lying to her.</p><p>“I’m serious. I know I’m not always…I can be quite hard on you, but you have started to deal with it extremely well.”</p><p>Sure…if dealing with it well meant having crippling anxiety and reminding herself not to dig her nails into her palms, then yeah, Rio was dealing with it wonderfully.</p><p>“It’s those qualities that will make you a brilliant queen.”</p><p>Rio froze, her tears still streaming from unblinking eyes.</p><p>“You’ve killed him?”</p><p>The Queen stared at her for a long moment, and Rio’s stomach twisted. This was it. The end of the world. When Rio gagged, the Queen said hastily:</p><p>“No, your brother isn’t dead. And don’t say that. We aren’t killing him, the coma is.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “You have the power to; it’s the same bloody thing.”</p><p>She groaned when another wave of pain slammed into her skull. She held her head with her right hand and found a mug being pressed into her left.</p><p>“Drink something, please. It’ll help with the headache, and I’ll get someone to bring some medication for you.”</p><p>“So, is this what this is? You’re being motherly so I’ll do as you say? Be the perfect Carlos replacement?” Rio bit out.</p><p>The Queen shook her head. “No, Rio-So-”</p><p>“Sureee,” Rio replied. “I will not be manipulated again, mother. If you kill my brother, I promise you I’ll be the worst first in line the Spanish monarchy has ever-”</p><p>“It is that hard to believe that I care about you?!” The Queen shouted. When she locked onto Rio, tears glazed her eyes.</p><p>Queens didn’t shout.</p><p>Queens didn’t cry.</p><p>Queens were never…weak.</p><p>Rio jerked her head, completely taken aback. For her mother to show vulnerability and especially in front of her was unheard of.</p><p>“It is actually,” Rio replied a moment later. “You don’t treat me like someone you care about.”</p><p>Her mother swiped at her tears. “It is because I want you to be the best version of yourself. I may not go about it the right way in your eyes, but it’s gotten the results. You are the beloved Princess of Spain. Our citizens only see you as the gracious picture-perfect princess you are supposed to be; that was because of me, Rio-Sofia.”</p><p>Rio stared at her.</p><p>“And I couldn’t have you ruining that by…by…”</p><p>“By being a lesbian?” Rio finished her sentence.</p><p>“By acting out, by being in the wrong crowd, by behaving like your brother. Men can get away with murder; women cannot. Not in this society, unfortunately.”</p><p>She didn’t have the energy to argue.</p><p>“So at least try and believe me when I tell you I love and care about you. I <em>promise you </em>I do.”</p><p>Rio said nothing, and when her mother realised she wasn’t getting a response, she nodded.</p><p>“Being first in line is a huge responsibility, and god forbid your brother doesn’t make it, you’ll be queen and can aim to change things.”</p><p>“You could do it,” Rio told her.</p><p>The Queen got up. “It’s too late for me; I have a reputation to uphold. You’re young, the people will respect you for it.”</p><p>“Mother, that doesn’t make any-”</p><p>“If you won’t be a good first in line for yourself, at least do it for your brother,” the Queen cut her off, hand on the door handle. She turned to get out, “And eat something, please, Rio.”</p><p>Her mother never called her Rio.</p><p>The Queen left, leaving her alone with a cold breakfast and a spinning head.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Tuesday, May 14<sup>th</sup> 2025.</p><p>For most people, today will be the same. Average. Maybe if their lucky, the weather will be decent. For Agatha, today will also be the same. Below average. Not even. She’d be in the pits of fucking hell, and more so because today was-</p><p>“Maybe she’ll call you back today,” Jen said softly as she finished off Agatha’s second Dutch braid.</p><p>“Yeah, maybe.”</p><p>“I mean…it’s her birthday. I don’t think she’ll be able to get through it without talking to you.”</p><p>Agatha was fairly certain Rio-Sofia could.</p><p>It was clear her girlfriend (could she still call her that?) didn’t need her. Why would she need a shoulder to cry on when-</p><p>“I know what you’re doing,” Jen huffed, sitting next to her on her bed.</p><p>“I didn’t even say anything,” Agatha replied.</p><p>“You’re spiralling,” Jen continued. “Just because you haven’t been talking doesn’t mean she doesn’t need you. She’s going through a lot, Aggs. Give her time.”</p><p>How much time did Rio need to answer one fucking phone call? Agatha had called her every day since the accident. She only wanted to know how her girlfriend was; she hated having to rely on media outlets for information when she should be able to talk to the source. Why didn’t the source want to talk to her? What had she done? Why was Rio-</p><p>“Stop it,” Jen’s voice said at the edge of her thoughts. “The world doesn’t evolve around you. Stop taking it personally.”</p><p>Ah, yes, because her best friend knew her so well.</p><p>“Just be patient, okay?” Jen told her.</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>“Are you sure you still want to come to Manchester with us? I’m sure Yelena wouldn’t mind if you missed her birthday, and Alice would also use it as an excuse to stay home so-”</p><p>“No, I’m coming,” Agatha replied, running her thumb over the ‘<em>R.V.’ </em>stitched in green on Rio’s hoodie. “I need the distraction.”</p><p>And she did.</p><p>All she’d done for the past two weeks was neglect her education to stare at her phone for the next news update.</p><p>“Alright then, let’s go. Trains in twenty.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Twenty-one.</p><p>That’s a big number, right?</p><p>A milestone. A new phase of life.</p><p>Rio had never celebrated a birthday without her brother; dreaded to think this might be the first of many. The clock struck midnight on the fourteenth of May, and her mother found her hunched over Carlos’s hospital bed, his limp hand in hers. Rio thought maybe Carlos might want to take the spotlight off her, wake up on her birthday.</p><p>He hadn’t.  </p><p>She spent most of the day by his side until her mother sent her home to change for her birthday dinner. She would’ve preferred to rot in bed but didn’t argue. Rio-Sofia didn’t do that much anymore. She didn’t have the energy, wanted to cause as few problems as possible. Her mother was right; she needed to do right by Carlos because it was her fault he was in the fucking coma in the first place.</p><p>It wasn’t all bad.</p><p>If she really did have to take on the mantle of queen one day, she could dismantle the traditional norms of the monarchy rule by rule. No more succumbing to the patriarchy, no more forcing your children to marry, no more hiding the fact that she was queer.</p><p>Rio didn’t want to be queen.</p><p>She was the spare, the ruined princess, the fuck up. Carlos was <em>everything. </em>Even at her best, Rio-Sofia could never be him.</p><p>A sigh left Rio’s mouth as she took herself in in the mirror. At least her dress was nice, <em>Versace</em> Spring 2005 Ready-to-Wear collection. It was a gold floor-length dress with a V-neckline. Rio appreciated the design of it, the thick left strap on her shoulder covered with sparkling diamonds which was a complete juxtaposition to the thin spaghetti strap on her right. The contrast was evened out by the high slit that revealed most of her right leg. She ran her hand down her side covered in more diamonds, the beading emulating the shape of the dress in thin rows.</p><p>There were <em>some</em> perks to being first in line. This dress was among the many new items in Rio-Sofia’s wardrobe. Her mother was letting her take control of her princess duty attire for the first time in her life. They’d spent the day going through archival 90s/early 2000s runway pieces to purchase, and although her mother turned her nose up and some choices, she liked most.</p><p>This had easily become one of Rio’s favourite memories with her mother, not that she could recall many.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched when silver glinted at her in the reflection. With tender fingers, she clutched the silver ‘A’ that hung off her neck.</p><p><em>Agatha. </em></p><p>She tried not to think about the other girl nowadays.</p><p>Too painful.</p><p>Rio-Sofia was already dying. Talking, let alone thinking about Agatha, would finish the job. What was the point anyway? Agatha couldn’t be there, couldn’t help her through it, couldn’t take away the pain or stop the suffering. She’d only be making things worse. Agatha hated feeling powerless, and offloading all her shit to her knowing there was nothing she could do about it would only make the other girl spiral.</p><p>Rio needed Agatha to focus, to prioritise herself, to focus on her studies, to…forget her.</p><p>She unclasped the necklace, placed it on the desk beside her.</p><p>“Fia?”</p><p>Ana’s muffled voice behind the door.</p><p>“Are you ready?”</p><p><em>No. </em>“Yes, coming.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>They were in the smallest dining room in the palace which came as a shock to Rio. She’d asked her mother to keep the dinner small, hadn’t expected her to listen. She’d been doing that a lot recently, listening<em>. </em>Rio-Sofia wondered if it’d ever stop feeling like Christmas every time she did. She hadn’t escaped Mateo nor the other bachelors though, but at least she got to sit next to Ana.</p><p>Her little sister’s hand found hers beneath the tablecloth as servers placed food onto the table decorated with candles and flower arrangements. Again, her mother had listened. They were Rio’s favourite flowers minus lavender. She’d asked for it to be removed; couldn’t see it or smell it without feeling sick.  </p><p>Rio set eyes on her dish of Gambas al Ajillo, before her gaze shifted to Ana’s tomato soup. Her stomach twisted.</p><p><em>“You’ve got something…” </em></p><p><em>“Oh, do I? Silly me.” Agatha pushed the tomato soup into her mouth with her thumb. “Gone?” </em></p><p><em>Rio blinked before nodding her head. </em></p><p><em>“Thanks, darlin.” </em></p><p>Rio’s breath hitched as the memory faded. Agatha had left a mark on everything. Try as she might, Rio could never get rid of her.</p><p>That feeling she knew all too well started inching up her body. The air felt thinner, lights too bright, voices too loud.</p><p>“Did you speak to Agatha today?” Ana asked amongst the chatter.</p><p>Rio felt like she’d gotten the wind knocked out of her.</p><p>“W-what?”</p><p>“Did you speak to her?” Ana repeated.</p><p>“I-”</p><p>“How is she doing anyway?” Mateo asked. “You’ve usually mentioned her by now.”</p><p>Rio dug her nails into her palms to stop the sob. When she yelped instead, the twenty people around the table turned to look at her.</p><p>“Are you okay, Rio?” Her father asked.</p><p>Rio-Sofia nodded. “Yes. Please would you excuse me for a moment?”</p><p>Rio locked onto her mother who gave her the go-ahead.</p><p>With that practised smile, she got up. The elegant, well-rehearsed walk she’d been sporting turned into a run the second she left the room. Rio picked up her dress and bolted towards the palace gardens. She didn’t make it very far; her knees buckled, and she collapsed. Rio wasn’t surprised when she looked up and saw Fuente de las Conchas (Fountain of the Shells).</p><p>A symbol.</p><p>The convergence of every path leading to the same final destination.</p><p>This was always Rio-Sofia’s fate.</p><p>She was always meant to be the picture-perfect princess who was dead inside. No matter which way she spun it, all roads led to this. It was a fact Rio would’ve ended up in conversion therapy. It would’ve chipped away at her soul until she was weak, easy to control, the picture-perfect princess.</p><p>Dead inside.</p><p>She couldn’t breathe.</p><p>A burning sensation wrapped around her heart, squeezed, wouldn’t let go. It was all so tempting. Inflicting pain on herself would make-</p><p><em>No. </em></p><p>She’d already broken that promise once tonight. Her hand snaked up to rest on her chest, and Rio sobbed when she remembered she’d taken her necklace off.</p><p><em>Why? </em></p><p>Why the fuck had she done that?</p><p>Her hands curled into fists.</p><p><em>Don’t do it. </em></p><p>But it was oh so tempting.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Agatha hadn’t felt like drinking tonight; instead, she’d opted for smoking a joint with Natasha before the party. It was a strange one, to have to put on a happy face when you’re rotting from the inside. She had to. If she wanted to mope around feeling sorry for herself, she should’ve stayed at home.</p><p><em>I need the distraction. </em>Agatha reminded herself throughout the night.</p><p>Yelena’s flat kitchen was overflowing with people. There was a DJ to her left and a drinks table to her right. Agatha was alone. Jen was with Alice, who was throwing up in Yelena’s toilet, and Natasha had disappeared half an hour ago, same with her sister, although Agatha had a sneaking suspicion she’d run off somewhere with Ava.</p><p>Agatha wondered what she’d be doing if Rio were here right now. She smiled at the thought. Her girlfriend would most definitely be forcing her to dance. Rio would make a show of it because drunk Rio never cared about the risks. They’d be in the heart of the chaos, and Agatha wouldn’t have it any other way.</p><p>Agatha missed her so much it physically hurt.</p><p>“I like your outfit,” a voice said from behind.</p><p>Agatha looked down at her black miniskirt and corset set. “Thank you, it’s-” she cut herself off when blue eyes met green.</p><p>Yeah, no. Agatha wasn’t doing this.  </p><p>“Agatha!” Wanda called when Agatha headed for the corridor. She caught her arm, and Agatha yanked it free.</p><p>“Fuck off,” Agatha grit out because why had Wanda chosen <em>now</em> to show her face?</p><p>“It didn’t work out, did it?” Wanda said. “With Rio. I was right, wasn’t I?”</p><p>Agatha felt like she was drowning, Wanda’s words grabbing hold of her and yanking her towards the murky depths. Tears pricked her eyes.</p><p>“What is <em>wrong </em>with you?” Agatha spat. “Seriously? Her brother is in a fucking coma, they only just caught the guys who did it, and you’re talking about the fact that you were right? There are more important things at stake here, Wanda!”</p><p>“There’s no need to yell, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, turning away when-</p><p>“Look, if you ever need me, I’m here, okay?” Wanda paused before she added. “I’ll always love you, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, tongue poking her cheek. “You disgust me.”</p><p>It was the last thing she said before she turned on her heels and continued down the corridor. Her phone started ringing then.</p><p>No caller ID.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Agatha left Yelena’s flat, heading for the stairs on her right.</p><p>“Hello?” Agatha repeated, hoping to pick up the reply now that it was quieter.</p><p>Same result.</p><p>At their big age, someone had prank-called her.</p><p>“You’re hilarious by the way,” Agatha said dryly before hanging up.</p><p>She made it outside, the night air hitting her skin when she realised-</p><p>“Fuck!” Agatha muttered. “Fuck, fuck, fuck!”</p><p>She unlocked her phone, tried to call the number back even though it was futile. Agatha slid down the wall of Yelena’s accommodation, her phone in her lap pleading with the universe that the number would call back. How had she been so stupid? Why hadn’t she connected the-</p><p>Her screen lit up, and Agatha didn’t hesitate to answer.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Strangled breaths filled her ears.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “You’re okay, baby. Just breathe with me, okay? Just listen to my voice: in for three, out for three.”</p><p>Rio wheezed like one would if they were being suffocated. A tear fell. This was it, complete and utter powerlessness. Agatha thought she knew what that felt like. How incredibly wrong she’d been.</p><p>“Baby, you gotta listen to my voice. In,” Agatha inhaled. She exhaled, “Out.”</p><p>Rio spluttered, and Agatha repeated the process, did so until it sounded like Rio wasn’t seconds away from dying.</p><p>“Would you like me to keep going?” Agatha asked.</p><p>The next thing she heard was a whimper that quickly turned into a sob.</p><p>Agatha’s hand tightened around her phone as tears slipped down her cheeks. If she could only <em>see</em> Rio, touch her, hold her.</p><p>“Baby, did you…did you hurt yourself?”</p><p>When Rio didn’t reply, Agatha was sure her heart stopped.</p><p>“It’s-”</p><p>“I called, didn’t I?”</p><p>And just like that, warm blood pumped around Agatha’s body at the sound of Rio’s voice.</p><p>“You told me to call you instead of hurting myself, and I promised I would,” Rio continued.</p><p>“You remembered?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I remember everything you’ve ever said to me, Agatha.”</p><p>She smiled as more tears escaped.</p><p>Silence kept them company for a while until Agatha said:</p><p>“Feliz cumpleaños, by the way. Have I ever told you I like older women?”</p><p>Rio’s laugh trickled into her ears, and it felt like breathing again. Had she really gone that long without hearing it?</p><p>“Gracias.”</p><p>“De nada. Hopefully I’ll get to see you and give you your present soon.”</p><p>Silence once again.</p><p>“Rio-”</p><p>The princess sighed. “You deserve better than-”</p><p>“Don’t you dare,” Agatha cut in, her voice cracking.</p><p>“This is already hard,” Rio whispered. “Don’t make it harder.”</p><p>“Then <em>stop</em>,” Agatha urged. “I don’t want this, I’m telling you, <em>I do not want this</em>.”</p><p>“Neither do I.” </p><p>“Then don’t-”</p><p>“I’m letting you go, Agatha,” Rio told her.</p><p>“No,” was the immediate reply.</p><p>“What-”</p><p>“It’s not allowed; I won’t allow it,” Agatha said flat out.</p><p>“But we can’t do this anymore, Agatha,” Rio insisted. “I can’t be what you need me to be. I’m barely holding on-”</p><p>“Then let me ground you. Let me be your foot on solid earth.”</p><p>Rio sniffed. “That’s not fair on you. It’s too much pressure. I need you to focus on your studies, baby. I need you to get everything you want out of life, and you won’t get it with me holding you back.”</p><p>“You’re not-”</p><p>“You said it yourself,” Rio interrupted. “And as much as it hurt to admit, it’s the truth. I’m not doing that anymore…you’re free of me.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean a word of that,” Agatha bit back. “I was drunk and angry. <em>You </em>told <em>me </em>that I was never getting away from you. What’s this then?”</p><p>“A lie just like yours.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “But we promised not to do that.”</p><p>“And we both failed.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows pinched, her tears flowing fast and hard.</p><p>“Remember that I love you,” Rio said moments later. “Even though I’m not around to say it.”</p><p>The line went dead.</p>

<p>Agatha had never cried so hard in her life, and that was saying fucking something.</p><p>She thought the veins in her head might explode, that the 60% of water in her body would dwindle to nothing, that she would die. There were worse ways to go, dying of heartbreak was somewhat poetic, dare she say romantic.</p><p><em>The Princess of Spain kills the love of her life. </em></p><p>What a headline.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>She looked up, caught a glimpse of red hair before Natasha embraced her.</p><p>“Why are you crying?” Natasha asked.</p><p>Agatha parted her lips to reply, choked when the weight of what happened hit her <em>again</em>. Rio had broken up with her. Rio had-</p><p>“I’m gonna throw up,” Agatha mumbled.</p><p>Natasha hastily pulled back, going behind her to hold her hair as she heaved. All that came out was liquid. Why shouldn’t it? She hadn’t been eating. Her body was in a consistent state of restlessness and therefore the thought of eating made her stomach churn. Agatha gagged three times before her body relaxed.  </p><p>“Are you having a bad trip?” Natasha questioned.</p><p>Was this a bad trip? Had Agatha hallucinated that entire conversation, and her princess hadn’t actually broken up with her? It was Bonfire Night all over again. Wanda, not Rio. Ginger hair, not brown. A trick of the mind. Yeah, perfect. Her brain was deceiving her.</p><p>“Who were you on the phone to?” Natasha said, picking up Agatha’s phone from the pavement, her call log up.</p><p>Agatha stared at it.</p><p><em>No Caller ID: 4 minutes. </em></p><p><em>No Caller ID: 30 seconds. </em></p><p>It’d taken months for Rio to get Agatha to open up her heart, four minutes to break it.</p><p>A burning sensation shot up her nose as tears filled her eyes.</p><p>“Aggs?”</p><p>“She broke up with me.”</p><p>Natasha’s breath hitched, tears welling in her own. “So did Lucia.”</p><p>A single tear rolled down Agatha’s face. “I’m so sorry, Nat.”</p><p>“I’m sorry too.”</p><p>They stared at each other a moment before embracing once again. They held each other as their bodies shook, sobs escaped, tears flowed. It occurred to Agatha then that this was all happening by a main road. Central Manchester had seen worse. Two girls crying over their girlfriends breaking up with them was nothing.</p><p>“Are you ladies alright?” A low voice asked.</p><p>“Fuck off!”</p><p>“Get out of here!”</p><p>The girls said simultaneously.</p><p>“Jesus,” the man muttered. “Next time I ask females anything.”</p><p>“I’m angry and heartbroken,” Agatha shrieked. “So keep pissing me off or call us ‘females’ one more time I fucking dare you!”</p><p>“I- I’m sorry,” the man stuttered, scurrying away.</p><p>“Fucking prick!” Natasha yelled, wrapping her arms around Agatha again.</p><p>Agatha sighed, resting her head on her shoulder, her tears still streaming.</p><p>“We’ll be okay eventually, okay babe?” Natasha said.</p><p><em>No. I really won’t. </em></p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p><em>Heated skin against cool, wet metal.</em></p><p><em>The smell of the earth after it’d rained. </em></p><p><em>The night air that was far warmer than it should be for this time of year. </em></p><p><em>Rio stared out at the palace gardens illuminated by the moon and lampposts. Mazes, flower beds, the Fountain of the Shells. She smiled, sinking further into her chair. This was only Agatha’s second night in Madrid, and Rio knew she’d miss these moments before they were over. If only somehow, some way, they could stay here. </em></p><p><em>Trapped in this moment in time forever.</em></p><p><em>The sex haze hadn’t worn off, wouldn’t anytime soon. Rio’s body always came alive whenever Agatha touched her, so when her girlfriend did so for hours on end, there was no coming down for a good couple of hours. </em></p><p><em>Rio’s eyes fluttered shut, her smile widening when she felt her presence. </em></p><p><em>“You just gonna watch me?” </em></p><p><em>“I was yearning,” Agatha replied. </em></p><p><em>Rio burst out laughing, opening her eyes to see her girlfriend in her balcony doorway in the red lace bra and matching underwear Rio swore she’d ripped, her lighter in hand. Agatha moved the chair opposite Rio beside her and sat down, encouraging Rio to put her legs over hers. </em></p><p><em>“You okay?” Agatha asked, freeing one of the cigarettes she’d placed underneath her bra strap. </em></p><p><em>“Mhm,” Rio replied, leaning forward to let Agatha place it in her mouth. </em></p><p><em>Her girlfriend lit hers before lighting the other cigarette she had. They fell into a comfortable silence taking drags from their cigarettes. Agatha started running her fingers down Rio’s bare legs, and just like that, Rio’s body was more alive than ever. </em></p><p><em>“You’re too far,” Agatha moaned after a while. </em></p><p><em>“Huh?” </em></p><p><em>“Up,” Agatha ordered, tugging on Rio’s arm. </em></p><p><em>Rio did as she was told and soon found hands on either side of her Calvin Klein boxers. Agatha encouraged her backwards until she dropped into her girlfriend’s lap with a yelp. </em></p><p><em>“That’s better,” Agatha grinned. </em></p><p><em>“Sex always makes you clingy…why?” Rio asked. </em></p><p><em>Agatha inhaled. “No, it doesn’t,” she replied petulantly, smoke tumbling out of her mouth as she spoke. </em></p><p><em>“Thought we weren’t supposed to lie to each other,” Rio teased. </em></p><p><em>Her girlfriend rolled her eyes. “I like touching you, tells me that you’re real and I didn’t make you up.” </em></p><p><em>“Because I could disappear at any moment?” Rio quipped. </em></p><p><em>“Because you’re too good to be true…too good for me.” And she’d whispered the last bit. </em></p><p><em>Rio shook her head. “No. Nothing could ever be too good for you, especially me.” </em></p><p><em>Blue eyes flicked slowly between brown. “I say otherwise.” </em></p><p><em>“And if I say you’re too good for me, now what?” </em></p><p><em>A smile split Agatha’s lips. “Then we’re perfect for each other.” </em></p><p><em>“Damn straight,” Rio replied. </em></p><p><em>Agatha’s smile was unwavering as Rio kissed her nose. </em></p><p><em>They fell into another spell of silence, finishing off their cigarettes as Agatha fiddled with the lace of Rio’s black bra. </em></p><p><em>“Do you know what I realised the other day?” Agatha spoke. </em></p><p><em>“Enlighten me,” Rio said, tapping her cigarette over her ashtray. </em></p><p><em>“I don’t think I’ll ever get bored of you.” </em></p><p><em>Rio furrowed her eyebrows. “…Thanks…I guess?” </em></p><p><em>“No, like this morning you were talking to me about how rare red robins are in the UK, and I actually listened. Mind you, I don’t give a flying fuck about red robins.” </em></p><p><em>Rio laughed. </em></p><p><em>“You could talk about anything on this planet, and I’d listen as if you’d just discovered time travel.” </em></p><p><em>Rio narrowed her eyes suspiciously. “Does that mean I can talk to you about metamorphosis?” </em></p><p><em>“Yes,” was the immediate reply. </em></p><p><em>Rio jerked her head, jaw open in shock. </em></p><p><em>Agatha bounced her leg, making Rio jump. “Permission to speak about frog life cycles granted. Go…” </em></p><p><em>Rio blinked a couple of times before diving right in: </em></p><p><em>“So they start off as eggs, right, baby? And-”</em></p><p>Rio's eyes fluttered open.</p><p>What was worse? The nightmares or the memories her brain kept plaguing her with in sleep? The torture was all the same. Her brother dying.  A past life where she was happy, where she was just out of reach from getting everything she’d ever wanted. She and Agatha had spoken for hours that night watching the moon fade and the sun paint the sky.</p><p>If only she could’ve trapped them there.</p><p>Rio had broken up with her girlfriend less than twelve hours ago but the pain in her chest was still the same, still fresh and bleeding like the moment she’d cut it.</p><p><em>You did the right thing, </em>Rio-Sofia reminded herself.</p><p>Maybe Agatha would be hurt now, but she’d get over it. Her girlfriend was a survivor, and Rio knew she’d survived far worse than her.</p><p>A knock on the door.</p><p>“Rio? Are you up, sweetheart?” Her mother called.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Okay, good.” The queen opened her door. “We’ve got a lot to get through today.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>The armchair in Carlos’s hospital room was becoming somewhat of a third home. Rio had the palace, her dorm room in London and now here. She would’ve come early, but you know, stupid fucking princess duties. Now, at a quarter to midnight, Rio-Sofia had spent the night yapping to her brother about her break-up. She wasn’t so sure about her decision anymore, or maybe the ache was too much for her to bear. It would all go away if she just fought for her girlfriend back.</p><p>That wasn’t fair.</p><p>Rio was a half-dead zombie; you don’t date zombies, they suck the life out of you until you become one. Agatha, with all her intelligence, wit and charm, didn’t deserve that.</p><p>She deserved to be free; she always had.</p><p>A princess with her one thousand and one rules and obligations wasn’t allowed freedom, never would be.</p><p>Rio drummed her fingernails on the cover of the play she was reading.</p><p><em>Romeo and Juliet. </em></p><p>That’s right. Her heartbreak had driven her to new lows…talking to a person who couldn’t reply…and reading fucking Shakespeare. She’d seen it on Carlos’s desk when she’d been in his room earlier, remembered the hours he and Agatha would spend debating his and other playwrights plays.</p><p>Her girlfriend, sorry, ex-girlfriend and brother were a bunch of literature freaks.</p><p>Rio smiled as she opened the page she was on, her breath hitching when her gaze landed on <em>that </em>line.  </p><p>All of sudden it was the Easter Holidays again:</p><p><em>“Fia?” </em></p><p><em>“Hm?” Rio stirred. </em></p><p><em>Her brother and girlfriend glanced at each other. </em></p><p><em>“You haven’t been listening, have you?” Carlos laughed. </em></p><p><em>Rio stretched before flopping back on her bed. “I’m sorry…I tried though. You both know Shakespeare’s not my thing.” </em></p><p><em>Agatha rolled her eyes. </em></p><p><em>“But this is interesting,” Carlos continued. </em></p><p><em>“Is it…?”</em></p><p><em>“The star-crossed lovers,” Carlos interjected loudly, waving his script of Romeo and Juliet around. “Fighting to be together even when the entire world was against them.” </em></p><p><em>Brown eyes locked with deep blue. </em></p><p><em>“And when they couldn’t be together in this life, they were able to in the next.” </em></p><p><em>Agatha held her gaze for a long moment before turning away. </em></p><p><em>Rio found herself swallowing. “That’s a nice way to say they both died in the end.” </em></p><p><em>Carlos smiled. “That’s what Aggs and I are debating. Sure, they died, but who’s to say that wherever they ended up wasn’t better?” </em></p><p><em>“It all depends on whether you’re a man of science or not,” Agatha replied. “If you believe in life after death, then fine, but if you don’t then they’re simply…dead.” </em></p><p><em>“Dead,” Carlos said at the same time. </em></p><p><em>“As if a forbidden love story couldn’t get more tragic,” Rio grumbled. </em></p><p><em>“I do not long to speak, I long to die,” Agatha murmured. </em></p><p><em>“What?” </em></p><p><em>Her girlfriend blinked, snapping herself out of whatever trance she’d been in. “Sorry, it’s my favourite quote.” </em></p><p><em>“What’s it mean?” Rio asked. </em></p><p><em>“That Juliet was desperate. That she would rather die than be forced to marry a man she didn’t love.” </em></p><p><em>A sickly feeling buried itself in Rio’s gut. </em></p><p><em>Agatha shrugged. “Some argue she only said it in the heat of the moment, but it’s such a testament to how strong our emotions can be, especially when love is involved. What would you do to avoid a loveless marriage…well Juliet was prepared to die.” </em></p><p><em>“What would you do for love in general?" Carlos added. </em></p><p><em>Brown eyes found blue again before they fell to Agatha’s fingers twisting their matching ring. </em></p><p><em>What were </em>they <em>prepared to do? </em></p><p>Rio’s room faded, the harsh white lights of Carlos’s hospital room taking its place. She ran her finger underneath the sentence.</p><p>“I do not long to speak, I long to die,” Rio recited amongst the beeps and whirls of the machinery.</p><p>“I thought you didn’t like Shakespeare.”</p><p>Rio snapped her head up. Deep brown eyes identical to her own were staring back at her. She blinked rapidly, tears slipping down her cheeks.</p><p>“Carlos?”</p><p>His lips lifted in a weak smile. “Hi, Fia.”</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate to leap off her chair and fling her arms around him. She sobbed, her body shaking as stiff arms embraced her. This was it. True and utter relief. She lifted her head only to kiss Carlos’s cheeks before lying back down again.</p><p>Oh, to hear his heartbeat pump at the typical rate.</p><p>To be able to look into her brother’s eyes, the windows to his soul.</p><p>To see him move.</p><p>To have him operating like a fully functioning human being.</p><p>“I’ve missed you <em>so </em>much,” Rio cried.</p><p>“Missed me?” Carlos croaked.</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>That’s right. Carlos had no idea what had happened to him or how long he’d been asleep for.</p><p>“Erm…I’ll get the doctors,” she said, getting up. She only made it a few steps before running back to her brother and planting another kiss on his face.</p><p>He shoved her away playfully. “Why are you acting like this? Did I die?”</p><p>Rio whacked at him. “That would be funny if we were in any other situation. Now stay there.”</p><p>Carlos waved his arms which were hooked up to various machines. “Yeah, because I’m going somewhere.”</p><p>Rio laughed and Carlos’s joined it. The tears came again. Some part of her thought she’d lost the privilege of hearing it.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio called over her shoulder as she stepped into the corridor.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah…I love you too,” Carlos replied as the door snapped shut.</p><p>Maybe it was because it was midnight why it took so goddamn long to find a nurse. Rio searched the hospital wing for a good five minutes before she found someone. She informed the woman about Carlos, and she grinned. Soon, two other nurses and a doctor were on their way to his room.</p><p>“We shall inform the Queen,” the nurse told her.</p><p>Rio nodded with a smile.</p><p>For the first time in two weeks, she could think straight, breathe properly, not act as if she were on autopilot. She’d meant what she’d said, that a part of her would die with her brother. She was slowly losing herself the more time went on. Now? Now, Rio was back at full force…dare she say…she’d been reborn?</p><p>Maybe that was stupid, Rio didn’t care.</p><p>She couldn’t waste this fresh start her brother had given her. This meant standing up to her mother, this meant being unapologetically herself, this meant…</p><p>Getting Agatha back.</p><p>An unexpected laugh left Rio’s mouth, and the nurses and doctor turned to look at her.</p><p>“Apologies,” Rio said, her smile wide, her eyes glazed with tears. “I can get my girlfriend back!” She blurted.</p><p>The first nurse she spoke to beamed. “I’m happy for you, Princess Rio-Sofia.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio giggled.</p><p>They reached Carlos’s room, Rio entering behind the four professionals.</p><p>That noise that filled her ears…she didn’t like it. The alarm felt like a thousand needles piercing her skull. The doctor and nurses sprang to life, rushing to Carlos’s side with an urgency Rio saw in movies. Why? Weren’t they supposed to be calm when dealing with someone fresh out of a coma?</p><p>The shouting started and orders were handed out. Had Rio dissociated? Possibly. She was in a backseat somewhere seeing someone else’s life. Was that a defibrillator? Like in those really dramatic scenes in movies. Ana hated them; she was always convinced the person was dead. Rio wanted to laugh at the number of times she and her brother had to explain acting to her.</p><p>CPR.</p><p>Defibrillator.</p><p>CPR.</p><p>Defibrillator.</p><p>CPR-</p><p>What movie was Rio watching again?</p><p>She wouldn’t have chosen it. Slow-motion? Random, but okay. The body jerked as it was shot with bolts of electricity, rising leisurely before drifting back down to earth. Rio should change the channel; she wasn’t in the right headspace to deal with an unhappy ending.</p><p>The nurses and doctor slumped around the hospital bed. Was the scene over?</p><p>The doctor shook his head before announcing:</p><p>“Estimated time of death, four minutes past midnight.”</p><p>Four minutes to break her heart.</p><p>Rio jolted, her body coming back to itself.</p><p>“S…sorry…could you repeat that?” Rio stuttered.</p><p>The nurses and doctor glanced at each other, and a wave of nausea slammed into Rio’s skull. She stumbled and soon found arms around her to keep her upright.</p><p>“Let’s sit you down, princesa,” the nurses urged.</p><p>“N…no,” Rio mumbled as they placed her on a chair. “You didn’t say…no,” she shook her head. “No, you didn’t…”</p><p>“Remember to breathe, okay?” The nurse told her. “What can you see, Rio-Sofia? Name them,” she soothed.</p><p>“B…breathe?!” Rio forced out. “What’s the point?! You just said my brother is dead!”</p><p>The nurse nodded, placing a gentle hand on her knee making her flinch. “You’re in shock and we know you’re prone to panic attacks. It’s important we help you get through this, okay?”</p><p><em>Get through this. </em></p><p>But there was no getting through this.</p><p>Carlos was-</p><p>“Dead. He’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead,” Rio mumbled.</p><p>He’d been all alone.</p><p>Rio should’ve been there. Why the hell hadn’t she been there?!</p><p>Why didn’t she stay a few more minutes? Why didn’t she scream down the corridor until someone came? Why didn’t she-</p><p>“He’s dead,” Rio repeated, eyes fixated on the wall.</p><p>And in some ways…so was she.</p><p>“Rio-Sofia?” The nurse asked when Rio had gone minutes without speaking. “Would you be able to let us know what you are feeling right now?”</p><p><em>I do not long to speak, I long to die.</em></p><p>“He’s dead.”</p><p><em>I do not long to speak, I long to die.</em></p><p>“He’s dead.”</p><p>“I don’t long to speak, I long to die.”</p><p><em>He’s dead.</em></p><p>“Rio-Sofia,” the nurse said, concern so evident in her voice. “You just need to breathe. Tell me, what can you see in this room?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes landed on Carlos’s cold, lifeless body.</p><p>“My dead brother.”</p>

<p>Agatha had never experienced grief before, not in this sense anyway. Her father died when she was two, and she had no recollection of it or him. Carlos, however, she would remember this feeling and him forever. The confident, easy-going, good-natured, future king that never was.</p><p>She curled into her best friend’s side on Natasha’s sofa in the living room. The blackout blinds still drawn; the only light coming from the TV. The screen blurred as the tears fell, the voices unintelligible. Maybe the reporter was saying something, maybe her five senses were dulling one by one.</p><p>Was this grieving?</p><p>Your body can’t cope with the loss so it just shuts down until it can begin to process it?</p><p>When would it stop?</p><p>She’d been shutting down for a little over a week now. Carlos had died two days after Rio’s birthday and the night it happened, Agatha had woken up at four minutes past midnight with a start. No news had broken then, but she could <em>feel </em>something so unbelievably wrong with the world that she knew a light had gone out in it. She’d been in and out of sleep until the first notification came through at 7:12 AM.</p><p>No thoughts.</p><p>She’d called Rio immediately, kept calling until the dreaded:</p><p><em>This number no longer exists. </em></p><p>Everything hit her then. Carlos was dead. Rio had lost her brother. She had no access to her girlfriend, and her girlfriend had no access to her. What if Rio tried to-</p><p>The thought had Agatha scrambling to the toilet. She didn’t make it, vomiting all over her bedroom floor. No one came to her rescue this time; she heaved as tears slipped down her cheeks. She felt so weak, so vulnerable, so…alone.</p><p>She wanted Rio.</p><p>Knew that Rio would want her.</p><p>And yet here they were oceans apart.</p><p>Who would be there for Rio now? Carlos was the person who fought for her, protected her, loved her. Agatha was just behind. Now what?</p><p>Who protected Spain’s future queen?</p><p>Future queen…</p><p>Rio was going to be queen.</p><p>The news reporter was in Agatha’s head as she said:</p><p><em>“The Spanish Princess, now first in line, Rio-Sofia Vidal.” </em></p><p>Agatha’s senses returned at full force, hearing the reporter loud and clear.</p><p>She sat up, wiping her eyes so she could get a better view. Stack of earrings…in? Long, stiff, black dress. Rio would never have chosen that. Hair soft, straight. Makeup…heavy. To conceal. Tear stains probably or eye bags or both.</p><p>Except-</p><p><em>Why isn’t she crying? </em></p><p>Rio walked behind Carlos’s coffin, and whilst Ana was in hysterics, Rio was-</p><p><em>Cry, baby</em>. <em>I know you want to. </em></p><p>Neutral, indifferent…the future queen of Spain.</p><p>“Why can’t I see you?” Agatha breathed.</p><p>Because she was looking into Rio’s eyes and found nothing, as if her soul had left her body leaving it empty and hollow. Agatha could always see Rio, even before she knew her. It was the tensing of her hands, the blinks to suppress eyerolls, the fidgeting. Everything that made her <em>real</em>. A living, breathing human with feelings and emotions and not the robotic, emotionless princess she was expected to be.</p><p><em>Where have you gone, baby? </em></p><p>It was like watching a ghost. Rio was there, but she wasn’t.</p><p>“There’s Alice,” Jen nodded.</p><p>Agatha caught it immediately. Alice’s gaze kept shifting between Carlos’s coffin as it made its way down the crowded streets of Madrid and Rio. She almost looked…what was the word?</p><p>Frightened.</p><p>Like maybe she truly has seen a ghost.</p><p><em>Come back to me. Please. </em>Agatha pleaded in her mind as if Rio might hear.</p><p>Because Agatha knew the girl she was looking at on the television screen was <em>not </em>her girlfriend.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Rio was drunk like she always was nowadays. Being drunk meant she didn’t have to think, or see, or operate like a functioning human being. A temporary fix to a long-term problem.</p><p>She’d snuck out of the palace to wander around the streets of Madrid. Flowers littered every corner, every pavement, every building. The country mourned their King that was never to be. Rio felt for them. Spain was destined for greatness under Carlos. Under her, Spain was destined for…she didn’t know. An idiot who didn’t have a fucking clue what she was doing.</p><p>If only she’d stood up for herself, made the speech, said the speech, had the far-right hunt her down. She let Carlos do it. <em>Why?</em> Why couldn’t she stand up for herself? What was <em>wrong </em>with her?</p><p>Far too much.</p><p>Rio ruined absolutely everything like she always did. She shouldn’t be breathing, she shouldn’t get to see another day, she shouldn’t get to keep her life. Nobody would miss her; everyone missed Carlos.</p><p>Rio paused. She hadn’t meant to walk here. Staring back at her was a memorial of her brother. The large black and white painting covered the wall beside the Plaza Mayor. Carlos was smiling, his smile lines so prominent, his face so youthful.</p><p>She <em>really </em>hadn’t meant to walk here.</p><p>The tears were inevitable, glazing her eyes over as her knees buckled. Pain shot through her body from the impact, the cobbled stones digging into soft skin, hurting, aching, bruising.</p><p>Rio didn’t care.</p><p>She sobbed as the weight of the world crushed her.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio slurred, looking into her brother’s eyes. “It should’ve…it should’ve been me.”</p><p><em>Abril 9th 2002 – Mayo 16th 2025. El rey que nunca fue. </em>The king that never was.</p><p>Rio read the sentence written by Carlos’s head over and over, drilling it into her skull.</p><p>It should’ve been her.</p><p><em>Stop crying. Queens don’t do that in public.  </em></p><p>She gulped in air to try and calm herself, stopped when she realised she might trigger a panic attack. Rio choked; the tears kept coming. Would they ever stop?</p><p><em>Stop crying, Rio-Sofia! </em></p><p>She dug her nails into her palms, tilting her head with a wince when the pain exploded in her hands. She pressed them in further, her nails sharp enough to pierce skin. Her body shuddered on command, and the tears stopped flowing. Rio closed her eyes, letting the discomfort wash over her.</p><p><em>You’re fucking pathetic. </em></p><p>Her lip quivered, and she bit down to halt the movement. More pain. The metallic taste of blood filled her mouth. She sniffled, wiping her mouth with her palm. Blood ran down it and across the indents. A salty tear splatted onto the mess she’d made. More pain. A delightful sting this time.</p><p>Rio stared at it.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Blood on her hands.</p><p>Hers.</p><p>Carlos’s.</p><p><em>What if I just- </em></p><p>She blinked the thought away.</p><p><em>I do not long to live, I long to die. </em></p><p>That wasn’t right. The quote went:</p><p><em>I do not long to live, I long to die. </em></p><p>That still wasn’t it.</p><p>Maybe it should be.</p><p><em>I long to die. </em></p><p>Rio shook her head.</p><p>“Stop it, Rio-Sofia,” she mumbled.</p><p>She needed more alcohol.</p><p><em>Get. Up. </em></p><p>Her eyes stung, mascara and eyeliner burning them as she got to her feet. Rio wiped at her eyes. A mistake. She’d smeared the blood on her hands onto her face.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio-Sofia grumbled.</p><p>Blood on her hands.</p><p>Blood on her face.</p><p>Blood in her.</p><p>Why not out?</p><p>Why not spill her own blood and-</p><p><em>Stop. It. </em></p><p>Alcohol. She needed it and fast. Rio stumbled towards the nearest shop.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>After about an hour and a half, Rio somehow made it back to the palace. The palace security asked if she was okay and if they should alert someone, she waved them off. When they looked like they might argue, she reminded them that she was their future queen and not to question her. They left her alone after that.</p><p>Her garden blurred before her eyes. The mazes morphed into the Fuente de las Conchas, which transformed into flower beds that gradually merged with the palace walls. Rio-Sofia blinked until her vision cleared. The wall looked interesting, fun, high. <em>Really </em>high. Had it always been that high?</p><p>She should climb it.</p><p>“I should climb it,” Rio nodded.</p><p>She took another swig of vodka as she forced her legs to move in the wall's direction.</p><p>“Bloody hell,” she muttered, squinting up at it.</p><p>She giggled. <em>Bloody hell. </em>Her ex-girlfriend used to say that. When had it snuck into her vocabulary?</p><p>“Tree!” Rio pointed.</p><p>She went over to it and stuck her foot in a nook in the trunk. Her foot slipped and she almost faceplanted the tree. A fit of manic cackles came over her in waves as her life flashed before her eyes.</p><p>“Thattt was closeee,” Rio slurred, repositioning her foot.</p><p>She hoisted herself up and began climbing, which was proving far more difficult with a vodka bottle. With a hand on the tree, Rio brought the bottle to her lips and took a large gulp before letting the glass drop. It hit the ground a great distance away with a shattering sound that made her wince.</p><p>If she fell, would that happen to her? Would she break? Shatter into a million pieces? Probably not. She was already broken.</p><p>Rio’s gaze returned to the wall above her, huffed when she realised she still had more to go.</p><p>A great deal of time later, she could finally reach the top of the wall. Balancing on one foot, Rio reached over to put her hands on the cold brick. A stinging sensation shot up her arm when her bruised hand made contact. She welcomed it, pressing further to help swing a foot over the wall.</p><p><em>Wasn’t so hard, </em>when Rio was comfortably straddling it.</p><p>She huffed again, exhausted from all the energy she’d exerted. The barbed wire and spikes that littered the ground outside the palace walls were just below. That would be a horrific way to go, impaled by the very thing that was supposed to protect her.</p><p>Nausea slammed into Rio out of nowhere, and she vomited.</p><p>She heaved until her body let up and allowed her to gulp in air. Maybe the wall wasn’t such a good idea.</p><p>Warmth.</p><p>A gentle breeze hit her skin, ruffling her hair. Rio tilted her head up to expose more of herself to it, drinking in the feeling as her mind spun. Her gaze landed on the night sky. There wasn’t a cloud in sight, and Rio felt as if she was looking into the heavens.</p><p>Stars for as far as the eye could see.</p><p>Carlos was up there, with the stars.</p><p>She wanted to be with him.</p><p>No thoughts.</p><p>She got into a crouching position, steadied herself, got to her feet, balancing on the wall as if it were a tightrope.</p><p>“I could touch them from here,” Rio whispered.</p><p>She stretched, trying to grab the stars, her brother.</p><p>“Just a little more.”</p><p>She got onto her tiptoes.</p><p>“Almost there-”</p><p>“Fia?”</p><p>Had someone spoken?</p><p>“Fia, stop it!”</p><p>No, she’d made that up.</p><p>“Rio-Sofia, get down from there!”</p><p>Just a little more.</p><p>Rio jumped.</p><p>“Please, you’re scaring me!”</p><p>Rio jumped again.</p><p>“Stop it! Please! Please- I can’t lose you too!” Ana screamed.</p><p>Rio froze like she’d been doused in ice water, her little sister’s words finally registering. She dropped her gaze to the small form beneath her.</p><p>“What…you’re not going to lose me-”</p><p>“I see how you’ve been acting,” Ana cut in, tears rolling fast and hard. “Like you don’t want to be here. You get drunk every night, sneak out of the house, mumble things you think I won’t hear like…like…‘I do not long to speak, I long to-‘”</p><p>“Don’t,” Rio cut in, holding up a hand. “Don’t you dare finish that sentence.”</p><p>“But you always do!” Ana yelled. “You always fucking do!”</p><p>“Stop that,” Rio-Sofia said, easing herself to stoop. “Don’t use that language.”</p><p>“Why?” Ana bit back. “What does any of it matter, right? That’s what you say.”</p><p>“Don’t listen to me.”</p><p>“You’re my older sister! Of course I’m going to listen to you! You’re all I have left!” Ana shrieked. “And instead of dealing with Carlos’s death together, I’m doing it alone whilst you do this!” She gestured to Rio balancing on the wall.</p><p>A punch to the gut.</p><p>How incredibly selfish Rio was being.</p><p>“Annie-” Rio-Sofia tried to soothe.</p><p>“No!” Ana interjected. “Sorry to bother you. Continue with whatever you were doing.”</p><p>“No,” Rio breathed. “I’m…I’m coming down, okay?”</p><p>Ana stared at her, and Rio nodded, inching towards the tree. It was much harder getting down than climbing up, especially with Ana watching. She couldn’t fuck up, couldn’t have her sister witness a catastrophe if she were to slip.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio reassured over Ana’s sniffles. “I’m coming down, okay? It’s alright.”</p><p>Her sister didn’t say anything.</p><p>Minutes passed as Rio shuffled down the tree, checking in with Ana as she went. She was close to the ground now, a little more and she could jump to safety.</p><p>“Just a bit further and-” Rio cut herself off with a scream as the branch she’d placed her foot on snapped.</p><p>“Rio!” Ana yelled, surging forward.</p><p>Rio hugged the trunk to stop the fall, using her upper body strength to keep her up whilst her feet dangled with nothing to support them.</p><p>Another scream rang out through the night air.</p><p>“Ana?!”</p><p>No thoughts.</p><p>She slid down the rest of the way and ran towards Ana, cradling her hand in the grass.</p><p>“Let me see,” Rio urged.</p><p>Ana sobbed, revealing her palm that had been sliced by a shard of glass from the bottle Rio dropped. Her sister’s warm blood trickled onto her hand.</p><p>More blood on Rio’s hands.</p><p>“You’re okay, I promise.” She pulled Ana into a hug, her body shaking with hers as Ana wailed. “Shush,” Rio soothed. “You’re okay.” She planted a kiss on Ana’s forehead. “We’re going to get it checked out, okay?”</p><p>“Don’t do that again,” Ana whispered.</p><p>“Won’t. Promise.”</p><p>Ana nodded as Rio rocked her in her arms.</p><p>When was she going to stop hurting the people she loved?</p><p align="center">***</p><p>The pitter-patter of rain hitting the window was somewhat comforting. Better to hear rain than your own sobs. Agatha curled in a foetal position in Rio’s room…old room. It’d been stripped bare. All the evidence that Rio had once lived in the space gone. Agatha lay on nothing but a mattress, was surrounded by nothing but empty walls. Her girlfriend’s smell used to linger, lavender with honey, but just like Rio’s hoodie, her temporary stain on the place had been long removed.</p><p>The habit was more like instinct now. Agatha’s thumb ran over the sewn forest green initials on Rio’s grey <em>Carhartt </em>hoodie. <em>R.V. </em>That always sat perfectly on the inside of her wrist. A tear splatted on the cuff making the dark grey darker. Would she ever stop crying? Agatha didn’t think so. There were many things to cry about, and she was certain she didn’t have enough tears.</p><p>The mattress started vibrating and Agatha grabbed her phone to send the caller to voicemail when her stomach dropped.</p><p><em>Incoming call from: Future King (allegedly). </em></p><p>Oh, how unfunny it was now.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, staring at her screen as it flashed at her. Was this real? Was this-</p><p>“Carlos?”</p><p>There was a pause before:</p><p>“…Ana…”</p><p>She couldn’t help the way her insides twisted at the disappointment. Sue her for having a little hope.</p><p>“I’m sorry I’m not him. I wish I was,” Ana said quietly.</p><p>“No,” Agatha replied. “Don’t be sorry. I’m glad to hear your voice, it’s been so long.”</p><p>Too long.</p><p>She shouldn’t have said that.</p><p>A soft sob crackled through Agatha’s speakers, and her heart ached.</p><p>“Ana? Are you okay?”</p><p>A stupid question.</p><p>“You need to come here,” Ana cried.</p><p>Agatha sat up. “What happened, sweetheart?”</p><p>“I need you,” Ana choked out. “So does Rio…tonight she almost-”</p><p>Panic started bubbling up through Agatha’s chest. “She almost what?” She urged gently.</p><p>“I don’t, I don’t know,” Ana mumbled. “She could’ve <em>died</em>! She promised not to do it again, but I…”</p><p>“Erm…” Agatha cleared her throat in an attempt to keep the pain out of her voice. “What did she…erm…”</p><p>She couldn’t say it.</p><p>Not to Ana, and not for herself.</p><p>To think that Rio might’ve tried to harm herself and Agatha hadn’t gotten a call threatened to kill her. Rio <em>promised. </em>So what they weren’t together? She was still supposed to call her. Agatha would still be there, always would be.</p><p>If only Rio let her.</p><p>“She’s okay for now, asleep. I’d rather not talk about it if that’s okay.”</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha said reassuringly. “Don’t talk about anything you don’t want to.”</p><p>She dreaded to think what Ana might’ve seen.</p><p>“You need to come,” Ana repeated. “We need you.”</p><p>Because they were supposed to be all in this together, right? One family dealing with the massive weight of grief.</p><p>That family died with Carlos.</p><p>“I can’t,” Agatha replied. “We’re not together anymore, and I don’t think me showing up would do Rio any good.”</p><p>“Bullshit!” Ana snapped.</p><p>“Don’t use that language.”</p><p>“It’s fucking bullshit and you know it!” Ana continued. “<em>Why? </em>Why, when you two need each other the most, are you acting like this? Carlos would hate you both!”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows pinched, tears glazing her eyes. “Don’t say that.”</p><p>“He would!” Ana yelled. “Why do you make things so difficult for yourselves? You love each other, right?”</p><p><em>I love her more than she’ll ever know. </em></p><p>“I think so-”</p><p>“Bullshit! You know so!” Ana told her.</p><p>“She doesn’t wanna see me, Ana.” And her voice cracked when she said it.</p><p>“You know that’s not true. Why are we going around in circles?”</p><p>Because what if Agatha showed up and Rio rejected her? What if she took one look at her and turned her back on her? What if-</p><p>“You really think Rio would reject you? She loves you. I know I don’t know much about love…I mean, I’m eight...but what you two have shown me is that it exists even when it’s not supposed to,” Ana paused before she added, “You don’t think that’s worth something?”</p><p>Something? No. No, it meant everything.</p><p>Rio meant the stars and then some.</p><p>But stars fade out…die.</p><p>Their relationship was just the same…mirrored the stars in the sky.</p><p><em>“Is it better to speak or to die?”</em></p><p><em>“What’s that mean?”</em></p><p><em>“Is it better to speak your truth or stay silent?”</em></p><p><em>“Speak your truth.” </em></p><p><em>“We both know it’s not that simple.” </em></p><p>“She doesn’t-”</p><p>“You’ll come because you love her…love me,” Ana continued.</p><p>That was it.</p><p>The line went dead.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>She really shouldn’t. She had four deadlines due in a little over two weeks and she hadn’t touched any of her work. Agatha didn’t care. Ana was right. She did love them, more than she should. Maybe Rio would reject her, but at least she could say that she tried, at least blue eyes could lock with brown for one last time before she never cast her gaze on them again.</p><p>Never again.</p><p>The thought threatened to stop her heart.</p><p>Agatha booked the next available flight, and after leaving the flat at six in the morning, she arrived at Stansted Airport with one carry-on and an overwhelming sense of dread in her stomach. She couldn’t shake the feeling that something was going to go wrong.</p><p>Once she’d checked in her baggage and downloaded her plane ticket, she found a chair to make sure she had everything. Passport, check. Rio’s birthday present, check. Rio’s hoodie, wearing it. Clothes, water bottle, skincare, check, check and check.</p><p>So far so good.</p><p>Agatha sighed, leaning back and pulling the hood up. She closed her eyes for a second before opening them again when her phone started ringing.</p><p>“Hello-”</p><p>“Where are you?” Jen rushed out.</p><p>“I’m about to head to security…why?”</p><p>“Go now, Aggs!” Jen urged.</p><p>Agatha sat up. “Why-”</p><p>The chill was immediate as the sun streaming in from the glass windows cut off when a figure stood over her.</p><p>She fucking knew it.</p><p>Something was going to go dreadfully wrong.</p><p>“And where do you think you’re going?” Evanora snapped.</p><p>“Aggs?!” Jen screamed down the other end. “Tell me you’re going! Mum said she saw Evanora and she’s…”</p><p>Her best friend’s voice faded away as icy blue eyes locked onto her.</p><p>Frozen still.</p><p>All Agatha could do was blink at her mother. She hadn’t seen her in months, not after Rio threatened her. In Agatha’s mind, her mother was dead, a figment of her imagination that could no longer touch her.</p><p>Rio ensured she couldn’t touch her.</p><p>Rio was gone.</p><p>“How…” Agatha cleared her throat. “How did you find me?”</p><p>Evanora glared at her, letting the uncomfortable silence drag on until she said:</p><p>“You haven’t seen me in half a year, and that is all you have to say?”</p><p>“I hoped you’d died,” Agatha said simply.</p><p><em>She can’t take anything from you. </em>Rio’s voice. Rio’s reminder.</p><p>Agatha didn’t have to take her mother’s shit anymore. She had the power, could learn how to wield it.</p><p>Her mother grunted, her face twisting into a sneer. “Me too.”</p><p>“Guess neither of us got what we wanted,” Agatha replied, smiling sweetly. “Now,” she went to move when her mother sat beside her, her hand clasping Agatha’s wrist, trapping her there.</p><p>“Leave me alone,” Agatha grit out. “We don’t have to do this. I hate you, you hate me, let’s be done with each other.”</p><p>“And leave my poor daughter to fend for herself in this cruel world? What kind of mother would that make me?”</p><p>“A terrible one, but you’ve already got that covered so-”</p><p>Evanora’s grip turned biting, nails digging into tender flesh. Agatha wouldn’t dare give her the satisfaction of wincing. She held her mother’s gaze as she tried to twist out of it.</p><p>“Oh so weak,” Evanora sing-songed. “I bumped into your friend…Ralph, was it? Lovely boy. He was home for the weekend, and we got into talking. He was telling me all about this wonderful little feature called Find My iPhone…have you heard of it?”</p><p>“Everyone’s heard of it,” Agatha bit back, squirming. “Most of us aren’t old and decrepit like you, mother.”</p><p>Evanora hummed. “Big words for such a small girl.”</p><p>Her mother’s grip loosened for a moment before they snatched onto her with triple the force.</p><p>“Anyway, he showed me how to use it and voilà! Here I am!” Evanora grinned.</p><p>“This is so jobless. You have nothing better to do than stalk me?”</p><p>Her mother’s grin was unwavering. “But this <em>is</em> my job. Other than god, my only purpose in life is you, sweetheart,” she said mockingly. “It is all women are fit for, being mothers.”</p><p>“And yet you’ve failed so miserably.”</p><p>Evanora sighed dramatically. “I will agree with you on that one. My daughter is a devil-worshipping abomination of nature. Unnatural. Unpure. Undesirable.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help the flinch as the word bounced around her skull knocking everything over.</p><p><em>She’s got absolutely nothing on you. </em>Rio reminded her again.</p><p>“Keep telling yourself that,” Agatha replied patronisingly. “I’m done with this, with you. I’m an adult and I can do whatever the fuck I want.” She snatched her mother’s hand, dug her own nails into crusty skin.</p><p>Evanora’s eyes flashed with horror because Agatha was actually <em>winning. </em>For the first time in her entire life, Agatha was forcing her mother’s hand.</p><p>“You’re going to leave me alone for what’s rest of your unfulfilled life or so help me god, mother, I will haunt you until the day I can put you in the grave.”</p><p>Agatha strengthened her grip.</p><p>“I’m going to make something of myself; be the best lawyer this world has ever seen.”</p><p>Carlos’s words only giving her more power.</p><p><em>You can’t convince the unconvinceable until you convince yourself. </em></p><p> “And when I do, I’ll sue you for every goddamn thing you have.”</p><p>She finally freed herself from her mother’s grip.</p><p>Finally freed herself from her mother altogether.</p><p>Evanora gaped at her, her mouth opening and closing, trying to find something to say.</p><p>Agatha flashed her a smile. “Nothing to say? Good. I’ve got a plane to catch.”</p><p>She got up, a weight lifted off her shoulders. Fuck this felt good. The only slither of happiness she’d felt in weeks.</p><p>“Doubt you’ll get very far,” Evanora spat.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, spinning on her mother until she heard the tear of paper.</p><p>“No!” Agatha shouted, surging forward.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>Her mother tore her passport in two.</p><p>“No! No, no, no,” Agatha mumbled as her mother dropped the pieces in her hands.</p><p>Agatha sank to the floor, tears filling her eyes.</p><p>“It’s been fun, Agatha,” Evanora smiled, leaving her daughter on her knees in the middle of Stansted Airport.</p><p>You can’t travel if there’s even a slight rip in your passport; her mother had ripped it to fucking shreds. Agatha sobbed, tears splattering on ruined pages. Why did her mother ruin <em>everything? </em>She was supposed to have won!</p><p>Agatha flinched when a gentle hand clasped her shoulder.</p><p>“Are you alright, dear?”</p><p>Agatha looked up to see a <em>British Airways </em>flight attendant.</p><p>She shook her head. “No. I’m supposed to be going to see my girlfriend, but…” she held up her broken passport.</p><p>The flight attendant shook her head regretfully. “I’m so sorry about that. Don’t worry though, there is always next time.”</p><p>No, there really fucking wasn’t.  </p>
