<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>1 Peter 5:8 - Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.</p><p>Agatha can feel her own heart beat, a thrumming pulse against her spine, a disjointed pressure that betrays the pattern of her breathing.</p><p>It’s not the first time blue eyes do their best not to stare at tender lips, Rio’s bottom lip caught between her own teeth. A focus in brown eyes that never leave Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>She tries not to focus on how they’d gotten here, the way Rio had always helped her up to sit on the edge of the bathroom sink closest to the barred window, the way her nails bit into her hips just long enough to press her ass into cold porcelain.</p><p>She tries to regret the way her knees open so easily for Rio’s hips to fit between her thighs, enough room for Rio to be so close. The way the press of the beauty blender steadies her somehow, held so delicately between nimble fingers. Agatha tries not to think about the care in Rio’s movements, pressing the concealer in, firm enough to cover the red mark quickly on its way to purple, but gentle too, doing her best not to cause any added pain.</p><p>Agatha swallows, retracing all the other times they’d been like this, her standard uniform skirt wrinkled up just enough to expose her thighs to the chill of the petulant air conditioner, perhaps a means of freezing out every student who dared step out of line. The hem of her dark blue skirt is high enough now to get sent to the office for a dress code violation.</p><p>The goosebumps blooming along her thighs countering the heat climbing up her chest, one of Rio’s hands perched against her jaw to hold her in place, the other dutifully blending the full coverage makeup over her cheekbone tenderly.</p><p>It was startling still, as many times as they’d been here, in the third floor bathroom of their all girls catholic school, Agatha waiting patiently for Rio to finish her art, she’d never figured out what to do with her hands.</p><p>She settled on tilting back slightly, one hand palming at the side of her sink under her thigh, the other hesitantly clutching to the bottom of Rio’s blazer, a war in her mind at wanting to hold onto the other girl tighter but not wanting to scare her away.</p><p>Agatha wished that this could be enough for her, that Rio’s unwavering protection, the empathy and understanding that reporting Evanora wasn’t something she could do, even if her mother was spending more time bruising her daughter's face than playing her role as principal.</p><p>It felt sacred, the most holy she’d ever felt, watching Rio work on her like she was the art, not the scribbles and doodles in the margins of Rio’s notebooks.</p><p>Agatha winces at a particular press of the blender sponge under her eye, the edge where the mark met her eye socket. She doesn’t know whether to be grateful Evanora didn’t completely catch her eye with her fist this time, a black eye swollen shut harder to cover up.</p><p>“Sorry”, Rio stops as soon as she hears the small intake of breath, feels the micro movement of Agatha tilting away. She strokes her thumb over Agatha’s jaw, the reality settling in that she could definitely feel the hammering of Agatha’s pulse against her fingertips.</p><p>“You okay?” Brown eyes finally find blue ones, an echo of the screams that shrieked through the universe every time their eyes met, the flickering butterflies Agatha has been tamping down around her friend since they’d met freshman year.</p><p>The four years of truly knowing Rio only pressing dirt into the wounds of unreciprocated yearning.</p><p>Agatha only nods, not trusting her own voice, her eyelids falling closed as if to mirror the movement.</p><p>“I’m almost done,” Rio whispers like its regal, something practiced like sipping wine, receiving communion.</p><p>Rio holds death here, a precipice of falling in that always seems to be pushed off for later, because they’re lips are so close, Rio already perfectly slotted into Agatha’s personal space, but she never leans forward.</p><p>It’s not long before Rio is stepping back, putting the concealer back in her makeup bag, washing her hands in the sink next to the one Agatha is still sitting on, too far away for the brunette to pull her in now.</p><p>Agatha is too busy staring at her side profile, the delicate crook in her nose, the way she wets her own lips with her tongue, to track the movement of Rio’s eyes.</p><p>“What’s that from?” Rio motions downward with her eyebrows, her hands still under the stream of water.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“This” Rio shifts closer again, not all the way into her bubble, but close enough to caress the outside of Agatha’s thigh. Her cold wet fingers sliding softly against a brown bruise a few inches away from her knee, the sensation causing the goosebumps to come back full force before they’d even had time to completely vanish.</p><p>“She usually aims for the face,” Rio offers, and Agatha would wince if it wasn’t true, Evanora always hell bent on attacking the most obvious places. Her mother wasn’t exactly picky with her targets, but more often than not, her cheeks and arms bore the worst of it.</p><p>“I don’t know what it’s from,” Agatha’s voice shakes, not liking how it sounds like she’s unsure, but in truth she’s only startled by how gentle Rio always is with her.</p><p>She almost wishes Rio would press her thumb into the brown and blue blob, shock some of that pain back to life, tired of feeling this numbness echo through her.</p><p>Rio searches her face, her fingers barely grazing the bruise, it almost tickles. She waits a beat, seemingly trying to find the lie in Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>“Okay”</p><p>—-</p><p>Agatha hates English class, hates the way Sister Hart seems to heavily rely on Spark notes to find any type of literary analysis, wishes there was more substance to their readings than redacted Shakespeare and the BIble. She hates Sister Hart’s lectures, the silent readings, the lack of opportunity for her to whisper to Rio across the foot of space between their desks.</p><p>Instead, she’s left to watch her, trace over the ridges of Rio’s face, the creases in her neck, the way she wished the collar of their uniforms fell just a bit lower against Rio’s collar bones.</p><p>She yearned for summer, Rio in tank tops and shorts, watching the night sky on a plush green blanket on Rio’s balcony. A sense of warmth when Rio could be completely herself. Agatha couldn’t believe this would be their last summer before college, before inevitable job searches and less time dedicated to each other.</p><p>As much as Agatha loves the warmer months away from school, less time spent in her mother’s clutches, a soaked in tranquility of wearing Rio’s crocs to grab the mail for Mr. Vidal while he worked over the grill, a bright smile from Rio’s mother who insisted Agatha call her Mama since they were 14, something more free in the way Rio allowed herself to hover closer somehow, let her eyes drift over her lips even if never spurred forward to connect them, Agatha wanted to savor their last few months of high school, feel the weight of childhood anchor her for just a little longer.</p><p>And for now, that felt kind of inescapable with Sister Hart’s current tangent about themes in Deuteronomy, free-will no longer on the table as the class sat with rapt attention, perfect posture.</p><p>Rio was doodling again, an expert at seeming completely engaged in the lecture, a facade of understanding nods, a show of taking notes that really consisted of small characters, attempts at calligraphy, webs of lines that morphed into sharp designs.</p><p>Agatha had always been amazed by how Rio could warp a page of loose leaf into a work of art, a balance of beauty and chaos mulled through Rio’s mind via a ball point pen. Chancing glances at Rio had always come first, but Agatha never failed to appreciate the scrawling doodles, had even wordlessly gifted Rio different color pens over the years for this exact purpose.</p><p>Chancing a look down toward Rio’s desk as their teacher is answering a question from a student on the other side of the room (Agatha is grateful for the distraction, but really what question could this girl possibly be asking right now), she traces over the top of the page, an intricate pattern one might think took a lot of forethought, and not something Rio had strung together on a whim. Below it is a tree, stoic and somehow moving, like Rio had drawn in the wind without explicit lines, the edges shaded with dark green ink. The image Rio is currently working on sits almost at the bottom of the page, about two inches from the border, the brunette’s hand hiding it from Agatha’s eyes, just from the natural way she’s holding the purple pen.</p><p>Agatha loves that Rio’s hands never work the same, sometimes making uncertain choppy lines, sketching out an echo of an object, trying to find the shape,or flowing smoothly across the page with intent. Right now, her movement more aligns with the latter approach, the pen held firm, the swirl of it slow and focused.</p><p>When Rio’s hand falls away, Agatha’s eyes settle on her own name, an elegant graffitied version that balances the humanity of Agatha with the chaotic abrasion she often wears (not towards Rio, never towards Rio).</p><p>Agatha can only blink at it, like a soft declaration that she might be held in the same regard as Rio’s art, the pages she saves securely in a folder and never lets anyone else touch.</p><p>Rio catches her of course, Agatha can feel Rio’s gaze on the side of her face, moves her own eyes to meet hers without a thought. She almost expects to find the other girl embarrassed, shrug off its meaning, remind Agatha without words that they are just friends, that they will only ever be friends.</p><p>What she finds instead is a soft smile, an almost smirk, a reassurance of something.</p><p>Agatha wishes she could question it.</p><p>”Ms. Harkness, can you tell the class your thoughts on last night's reading assignment of the book of Romans?”</p><p>Agatha hates English class.</p><p>“We’re all sinners,” Agatha almost huffs, wills herself to zone back into class without rolling her eyes, or saying something that would get back to her mother, “We don’t meet God’s standards which creates a need for salvation.”</p><p>”Good,” Sister Hart offers dejectedly after an unnecessary space of silence, as if she got off on the fear that curdled in its wake (could Agatha really take away those small wins from someone who’s a volunteer celibate?).</p><p>“Now who can tell me some examples of these sins that Paul writes about in Romans?”</p><p>Wanda is the only student to raise her hand, a red head too eager to be teacher’s pet, Agatha’s ears already ringing from all the times she’s winced at the sound of her voice. Rio always telling her to chill out, never understanding exactly why Wanda grated on her nerves in particular.</p><p>Maybe it was the favoritism, maybe it’s because the nuns liked her for her dedication, her photographic memory of just about every verse. Maybe it was because Agatha always got the fake, unearned version, a quiet pity of being the principal’s daughter but never living up to those expectations.</p><p>Sister Hart tilts her head just enough to spur Wanda to speak and Agatha has to shut her eyes to stop herself from groaning.</p><p>“Romans. Chapter 1, verse 27,” Wanda starts, no book in front of her, ready like she’s about to list the first 300 digits of pi. “For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.”</p><p>Agatha grinds her teeth together, willing herself not to hurdle the 3 rows of desks between her and Wanda, because why the fuck was she choosing that particular verse.</p><p>”Okay, and what is Paul trying to say there?” Sister Hart asks, no change in her demeanor, unbothered by the ‘concrete truths’ Wanda had performed.</p><p>But there’s silence, no one daring to answer for the moment. Agatha isn’t sure what it is, if Wanda’s the only proud homophobe, if everyone else in the room gained nothing from four years of deep biblical analysis, or they’ve officially clocked out of the conversation.</p><p>Agatha is looking straight ahead, afraid to find the answers to long unasked questions in the features of Rio’s face, afraid her own eyes will give her away.</p><p>For all the close proximity, the charged glances, they’d never spoken about it. After many futile attempts of Rio asking Agatha about boys, somewhere in their friendship Rio had given up the topic altogether, and Agatha couldn’t say she was sad about that.</p><p>So when she hears that familiar voice, the one that had whispered good nights against her ear, reassured her through the bruises on her face, the weight of Evanora’s words, it felt odd. The pattern of Rio’s breathing a chorus it had never traced in front of Agatha before.</p><p>”Homosexuality,” Rio breaks the silence, maybe only pressed on by the awkwardness, “He’s talking about homosexuality” comes the clarification, a little more dull, a little slower.</p><p>Agatha still doesn’t look at her, suddenly very interested in her own pen.</p><p>“Correct, Ms. Vidal. Any other examples?” Sister Mary moves on.</p><p>Agatha was unsure if the lack of further discussion on that particular example came from indifference or perhaps the nun’s inability to even acknowledge sexuality outside the parameters set by the Bible.</p><p>She checks out of the group fully then, disassociating enough to free fall into a spiral of worry, fixated on the way Rio’s voice grated over the words, the shred of emotion in it that Agatha couldn’t pinpoint.</p><p>For all the yearning, Agatha was pessimistic at best, she knew that reality probably more closely aligned with Rio not reciprocating her feelings, that Rio liked boys, had spoken of first kisses with sweaty boys at summer camp, cut out pictures of Timothee Chalamet and Michael B Jordan on her bedroom walls. And as crushing as those thoughts were, Rio being homophobic would be so, so much worse.</p><p>She’s broken out of it when she catches movement in her peripheral, Rio’s arm outstretched towards her desk for a fleeting second.</p><p>When she finally looks down, a two inch scrap of paper sits on her notebook, the edges curling both from the rip and the way Rio must have scrunched it in her hand. Agatha usually found it endearing that Rio still passed notes like this, sticking to pen and paper when they could very easily conceal their phones under their desks. She appreciated the practicality of it even if they were more likely to get caught, it makes her feel like they have little secrets just for themselves, even if they were just Rio reminding her to pay attention half the time.</p><p>The split second before she reads it feels like it trails on too long, just a flash of time where she’s worried what Rio has to say to her so urgently.</p><p>‘Do u still have dinner w the devil tonight??? :(‘ is scrawled out in Rio’s unique handwriting, neat but something bouncy to it, the purple ink smeared a little from Rio’s inexplicably sweaty hands.</p><p>The note is referring to ‘family dinner’, standing tradition for Evanora and Agatha to have dinner together every Wednesday, a practice she never understood as Evanora couldn’t stand her and she’d never known her father. Agatha liked to think it was her mother’s way of keeping her on a tight leash, reminding her at least once a week that she was still in control, that Agatha was old enough to fight back now, but that doing so would somehow make it worse.</p><p>It had worked up to this point, Agatha having no other options, putting her trust into Rio that she wouldn’t say anything, waiting out another few months at least til she could get a job and save up enough to look for an apartment. Her mother’s crushing expectations just as much a factor in her good grades as her need to get a full scholarship so that she didn’t have to rely on Evanora to pay for college.</p><p>She’s already accepted the scholarship for Darkhold University, but had yet to secure a plan passed staying at home and commuting the 30 minutes everyday.</p><p>‘Unfortunately, why…’ Agatha writes back, her handwriting a lot less neat, folding the bit of paper a couple times before tossing it back onto Rio’s desk.</p><p>‘Wanted a hw buddy’ Rio writes back like they don’t always do homework together. Agatha had lost count of afternoons spent in the library or at Rio’s kitchen table, hours where they’d slip from working silently next to each other to gossiping about the nuns to talking about everything they’d dreamed of, teasing each other until a librarian had to remind them to be quiet, or Rio’s mother would chuckle at them and set them back to work.</p><p>Still, something pulls at Agatha, a desire to rebel, a new-found interest in actually seeing what consequences Evanora will lay at her feet. She’s already got bruises to cover, deep emotional baggage from years of being told she’ll never be enough. What else could she do? Maybe Agatha wanted to find out.</p><p>‘I can bail,’ she writes, hoping Rio will let her put herself at risk, but knowing her well enough that the brunette won’t agree.</p><p>She isn’t surprised by Rio’s face after reading her last addition to the note, a silent ‘are you serious?’ in her eyes that neither of them needs words for. It’s one of those things that makes Agatha’s heart hammer in her chest, the silent communication, the fierce protectiveness, Rio never afraid to tell her she’s being reckless for no reason.</p><p>The bell rings. Thank God.</p><p>“Dude,” Rio starts, written conversation definitely not over as they both move to grab their things and go to their next classes, “please go to dinner, we’ll hang out tomorrow” she shrugs like she isn’t actively trying to lessen Evanora’s wrath.</p><p>—-</p><p>Dinner with Evanora isn’t awful, a quiet back and forth of half pleasantries, or whatever Evanora considers passable as family bonding. Agatha sets the table, holds her breath, skates around the tense air like she always has, careful and quiet.</p><p>Maybe it's why Agatha is so loud and unapologetic in front of everyone else, why she can’t reel in all the emotions, a performance of sorts doing her best to curate the version of herself she thinks might have happened had her mother been supportive in any imagination of the word, a confidence, a desire to do something more than get away from this house.</p><p>Here, she wears a different mask, a solid coating of concrete that hardens over her eyes, stops the wrinkles of worry, but also never lets her smile.</p><p>“I see your face is looking better,” Evanora comments like she’s asking about something trivial, but Agatha hasn’t seen the woman meet her eyes, even look up from her plate since they’ve sat down.</p><p>Agatha is used to this game, the placating, the pushing down, talking about abuse like it’s nothing, like Agatha’s pain is nothing.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha answers, knowing her mother expects a verbal answer, knowing Evanora is hoping she takes the bait, but Agatha has had years of practice, knows better than to question it.</p><p>”Where did you get the makeup?” Evanora asks, no heat to it, a simple demand.</p><p>Agatha isn’t allowed to wear makeup. Apparently not even to hide the evidence of her mother’s rage. Rio had been using her own makeup on her for years, Evanora never commenting on it. Agatha knows Evanora isn’t that stupid, to think that over the last 4 years Agatha’s healing abilities had become superhuman. And in the past she might have been confused as to why her mother was picking at something that was protecting her image, but Agatha almost took it as a compliment. If anything, it made it abundantly clear that Agatha had become extremely skilled at tucking in the loose edges of Evanora’s expectations, making it so the woman had to find more ridiculous things to fret over.</p><p>“Someone at school,” Agatha still does her best at honesty, wanting to tow the line between lying and keeping Rio’s name out of her mouth in hopes it might shield the girl from her mother’s wrath.</p><p>“That Vidal girl?” Evanora voices like a question, but Agatha knows she isn’t really asking.</p><p>“Yes”</p><p>”I don’t want you hanging around her, Agatha” the words ring like a curse, a declaration of prayer, something not meant to be fought against.</p><p>”Mother-“ Agatha tries anyway, her mind not even allowing herself to dream of a life where she wasn’t allowed to see Rio.</p><p>“She’s not a good influence on you.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t know how to say that Rio makes her feel most like herself, brings out a smile in the soaring weight of pain, cares for her like she is sacred, propping her up in all the times she feels unable to stand.</p><p>“Agatha.” Evanora’s voice always feels so raw around the syllables of her name, a name she’d given her to mean ‘virtuous’, an expression of high moral standing, perhaps a reflection of all the virtue Evanora lacked. ”Tell me you understand, no more hanging around that girl.”</p><p>”I understand,” the words feel crushing, even if Agatha had no intention of pushing Rio away. It still stung. The fear that their friendship would be strained by operating under cover, how far Evanora might go to spy on them, separate them in class, punish Agatha for every text message, every glance.</p><p>It felt like a new low, an answer to Agatha’s earlier attempt at rebellion without even following through with skipping dinner. Her mother was so willing to rip away anything and anyone that brought her joy, a need to isolate her from the world, keep her ugly behind closed doors, break her down over and over for her own selfish pleasure.</p><p>Agatha pushed around her peas with her fork, Evanora had never been a good cook, but the bland food wasn’t the only reason for her lack of appetite. She poked at the pot roast, feeling the nausea lurch forward, praying her mother wasn’t paying close enough attention to how much she was actually swallowing.</p><p>“Are you not hungry?” Evanora asks, God evidently not hearing Agatha’s prayer. Evanora’s words almost rang close to the words of a mother who actually cares about the nourishment of her child. Only making dinner once a week, Agatha mostly got by on the tangerines Evanora kept in a bowl on the counter mostly for show, the extra empanadas Rio packed for her at lunch, church service refreshments of kool aid and cucumber sandwiches, and Saturday dinners courtesy of the Vidal family.</p><p>“I just have a lot of homework,” Agatha half lies, the essay she has due next week already half written.</p><p>”Well, don’t let me keep you,” Evanora waves her away vaguely and Agatha tries not to show her relief, “You’ve been looking quite bloated lately anyway.”</p><p>It’s one of those comments that sinks against her skin, makes her throat tremble, her knuckles feel ridged and locked, the type of line that had gotten a reaction so many times. But the bruise on her cheek still throbbed, she didn’t want to give Evanora another reason to lash out, feeling too unsteady from the thoughts of Rio, especially when her mother had given her a chance to walk away.</p><p>”Okay”</p><p>Agatha moves slowly, giving Evanora the opportunity to take back her permission if she saw fit, but she stands without another word from either of them, cleans her plate, places it in the dishwasher, before ascending up the stairs to her room.</p><p>Evanora doesn’t like when Agatha closes her bedroom door, so she doesn’t. No sanctuary of her bedroom walls, nothing more than an extension to the hell Evanora had crafted their home into.</p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Ecclesiastes 4:9-10- Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labour. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and hath not another to lift him up.</p><p>The sun is starting to set, Agatha’s window a portal to heaven, the sway of trees, the cotton candy blend of blue and pink horizons, fluffed expanses of white clouds.</p><p>She wishes she could touch it, play in the art God had made in the sky each night, find the strings of herself that still believed in Him despite her circumstances.</p><p>Rio once said that’s what she liked about Agatha most, the way she still hoped for things, ached to see the good in people despite her own reality. It didn’t feel like a test from up above, a series of hardships she could endure and still find the courage to be righteous.</p><p>It felt like a spell cast by an evil wizard, a damning curse she’d have to find a way to undo if she wanted to feel truly free. It was a battle, a storm of conflict fighting everything she’d ever been taught, cycling through Sunday service enough times to start to strain out the parts worth keeping from the words that brought on all this grief.</p><p>For all the ‘love thy neighbor’ and ‘I can do all things through God who strengthens me’, it was still the reality that empowered her mother to hit her, still the life that gave her no father, the world she couldn’t escape or recede from.</p><p>And still, this life gave her Rio. A force of love. A pillar in her life that had saved her from the crash right before impact every single time.</p><p>She was doing her best to focus on homework, wishing Rio was here to explain Standard Deviation to her for the 50th time at least. As naturally smart as Agatha was, she hated for anyone else to know she actually put in a lot of effort. Rio was the only person that made her feel proud of it, like it was out of drive and not fear.</p><p>Everyone else got the version of Agatha that presented as effortless, flawless, an ease to which she operated, which perhaps only reinforced the perception that she was only favored for the status of her mother and not for doing any real work.</p><p>Rio was like her sidekick in that regard, girls at school knowing them to be a package deal, not exactly popular, but also not unknown.</p><p>Agatha. The principal’s daughter.</p><p>Rio. The only one willing to be her friend.</p><p>Agatha’s phone buzzes halfway through reading a question about the median (a concept she very much understands), she knows it’s Rio without looking, a cosmic tell to the way her heart eases before even picking up the device from her bed.</p><p>‘wyd’</p><p>Agatha hates that such a low effort text earns a soft smile, that Rio thinking about her at all is some grand gesture.</p><p>‘HW’<br/>
’alone ofc’</p><p>Agatha answers, maybe too quickly, but she can’t chastise herself too long.</p><p>’open ur window’</p><p>’???’ Agatha responds, her thumb jamming the send with maybe too much might, but she hops out of bed all the same, walking the two steps to her window and lifting it open before peering down.</p><p>There stands Rio, one story down. She’s not in her school uniform anymore, a long sleeve gray shirt, gold letters on the front that read ‘St.Anthony Bible Camp 2022’, and straight fit joggers, held in her hand a white paper bag with the unmistakable orange of the Dunkin Donuts logo on the front.</p><p>Rio raises her eyebrows in silent question.</p><p>A part of Agatha wants to yell at her, call her an idiot for showing up unannounced when her mother is home, tell her to leave, save them both from whatever unknown outcome.</p><p>But she can’t deny the way her heart thumps in her ears, the way Rio’s brown eyes glow against the setting sun, the way her hair is down now, the put together look from earlier today at school softened now, that stupid grin she always wears. And more than that was her determination to see Agatha, this unasked for (but so desired) need to be around her, bring Agatha her favorite donut.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, trying to quell away the tears, happy tears at the beauty of her friend caring for her so earnestly. But she can’t stop the wrinkle of the smile she returns despite her innate desire to want to come off as unaffected.</p><p>She holds up a hand, palm toward Rio, trying to tell her to wait a moment. She walks softly toward her open bedroom door, doing her best to avoid the creaking pressure points of the old wooden floor. She waits a moment in the threshold of it, listening intently. She can make out faint murmurs from the television in the living room, Dr. Phil reruns about wayward children no doubt. She closes her door inch by inch, slowly with both hands, concentrating on keeping it steady, until it clicks into the wall softly. She stands there another moment catching her breath, listening again for any shifts of movement or Evanora’s footsteps up the stairs.</p><p>After a moment of nothing, Agatha turns back towards the window, a push of desire to run back to Rio, but she treads across the wood panels delicately. She hatches a plan to throw down one of her bed sheets, hope Rio possesses the arm strength necessary to use it to climb up, but when she peers down once more, Rio is closer now, a lot closer.</p><p>The heathen had somehow scaled up the siding of the house, her nimble fingers apparently skilled at more than just blending concealer over bruises. The donut bag held securely between her lips, the look of concentration just as clear as when she’s working on a drawing.</p><p>Rio takes the hand Agatha offers her and somehow gracefully (and quietly, thank God) makes it through the window. Rio takes the rolled up edge of the bag out of her mouth, and Agatha winces at the saliva left behind, unable to rid her mind of the taste of thick brown paper.</p><p>Rio half chuckles at her reaction.</p><p>”Hey” she finally says, the word feeling heavy and light all at once, like it was casual for Rio to climb the side of a house to deliver a sweet treat.</p><p>But Agatha can’t risk the unpredictability of it.</p><p>She clamps a hand over Rio’s mouth, evading Rio’s personal space, their eyes locked in a desperate plea to please shut the fuck up. Agatha tries not to think of the softness of Rio’s lips under her touch, the way she doesn’t fight her off.</p><p>”She’s downstairs, you have to be quiet” Agatha whispers, but it strikes like a dagger.</p><p>Rio nods softly, her eyes boring into Agatha’s, a calculated measure of understanding. Still, it takes an extra moment for Agatha to move her hand, maybe finding the strength to trust Rio to keep this promise, maybe to commit Rio’s soft brown irises to memory.</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio whispers, “I just wanted to check on you”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t look at her, the uninterrupted care something she still can’t face head on sometimes. Instead, she focuses on the bag, easily pulling it from Rio’s grip. She opens it and looks inside.</p><p>”Boston Crème’s are usually reserved for when you think I’m about to spiral” Agatha chirps something slightly above a whisper, the bleak reality of it soft but telling.</p><p>Rio swallows harshly when Agatha’s eyes look up again, trying to combat Agatha’s assumptions. She hesitates, looking around the room, obviously trying to change the subject.</p><p>Rio had never been in Agatha’s room before. Mostly because Evanora never allowed company, especially if it was Agatha opening the door to them. She’d never been ballsy enough to sneak her in either, afraid Evanora had secret cameras posted by the door, in the kitchen, ways to monitor Agatha when she wasn’t home.</p><p>It was also the fact that Agatha was kind of embarrassed by it, her bedroom not a reflection of who she was or anything she liked. White walls almost clinical, never afforded the opportunity to pick what color her room would be, never given the freedom to decorate. Her twin bed in one corner, a tidy closet with the door closed. Two oak night stands, old and cracking. No TV. The only other additions were the cross above her bed and a gray alarm clock well past its prime.</p><p>It felt empty, an echo of what could be. Rio asks about homework maybe because there’s nothing else to ask about.</p><p>”Statistics?” Rio voices, still hushed.</p><p>“Yeah” Agatha sighs, not prodding any further about why Rio had turned up at her window with her SOS dessert of choice. She doesn’t have the mental energy to push. And while she doesn’t think they’d fight about it, she doesn’t want to risk the chance of their voices growing louder.</p><p>Rio sits on the edge of the bed, kicking off her sneakers quietly before settling further back to look at Agatha’s textbook.</p><p>“Do you need help with number 6?” Rio asks, not in a judgemental way, just noticing that Agatha had left it blank on her worksheet, that strong resolve of always being present, always trying to help. Rio was too good for her.</p><p>Agatha nods, sitting back in her original spot on the bed, letting their knees brush.</p><p>She hates how easy it is, how they effortlessly fall into working out the problem, Rio walking her through it, her voice remaining just above a whisper, their bodies close as they share the textbook. She hates how she rips the donut in two without a second thought, handing over the bigger half to Rio like she’d always be willing to take 49% if it meant giving Rio 51.</p><p>She hates that Rio is offensively polite, achingly gentle, tremendously thoughtful, doing her absolute best to save Agatha’s white bed sheets from any possible crumbs, that she can undo all of Agatha’s harsh edges just by being next to her.</p><p>On the last statistics question, Rio shifts, her head falling on Agatha’s shoulder, “I’m sorry” she whispers, somehow quieter than all her previous words, causing Agatha’s hand to stutter, her brain suddenly losing it’s sense of intent.</p><p>“For showing up unannounced,” Rio supplies the reason for her apology before Agatha can even ask for it, “I don’t wanna get you in trouble.”</p><p>”I know your intentions are good” Agatha’s voice trembles. She thinks to add ‘they always are’, a mark of the way Rio has only ever been this selfless, positive person. Another reason Agatha felt unworthy of the current of Rio’s friendship, a river so powerful she’d never been able to stop flowing with it.</p><p>“Let me put my books away,” Agatha almost whimpers, needing an excuse to put space between them, but not wanting Rio to feel like she’s pushing her away.</p><p>Rio lifts her head, but when Agatha leaves the bed entirely, she only snuggles further into the sheets, fully laying down now.</p><p>When she turns back to look at her, a dream Agatha’s had many times of Rio in her bed, holding her in a way that read as more than just friends, this felt like too much, like Agatha couldn’t have this, whatever it was without it spelling disaster.</p><p>Evanora convinced her a long time ago that she deserved nothing good.</p><p>And Rio was so good.</p><p>As much as she’d dreamt of Rio loving her that way, having Rio all to herself, caring for her, protecting her as fiercely right back, Agatha couldn’t bear the thought of taking her away from everyone else.</p><p>Rio was the sun, and Agatha was unwanted weeds. In all the growth, Agatha could never feel like she truly deserved her.</p><p>“Can you lay here with me for a few minutes?” Rio asks, a pressure to her voice like she’d been trying to find the nerve to ask.</p><p>Agatha can’t say ‘no’, cursing herself for how long she’d been taking to figure out how to ask Rio to leave.</p><p>Instead, she joins Rio, facing her, the twin bed not leaving much space between them, but Agatha does her best to keep from touching her.</p><p>But Rio is like an Agatha magnet, her fingers delicately tracing the outer edge of her wounded cheek bone, Agatha latches onto her wrist. She tells herself it’s a safety mechanism, security for the chance Rio presses too hard, but it feels more like an anchor.</p><p>“Does it still hurt?” the words bloom from Rio’s mouth into the small bubble between them.</p><p>”Mmmm” Agatha hums, not trusting her words, not wanting to break this spell.</p><p>Rio’s fingers dance higher, tucking stray hairs out of Agatha’s face, her eyes gliding over the angle of her nose, the plane of her eyebrows, before settling back into the oceans in Agatha’s irises.</p><p>Rio’s eyes get watery, its barely perceptible, but the collapse of her eyelids, the way she bites her lip. For the first time Agatha wonders if maybe Rio is the one on the verge of spiraling, this whole grand gesture a cry for help, a dazzling hope that Agatha would see through the facade and know.</p><p>Rio’s eyes are closed, her eyebrows slightly downturned, holding in, bracing for something. Her hand now settled on Agatha’s neck, her thumb stroking against her jaw.</p><p>“It’s okay to cry, Rio” Agatha doesn’t know what makes her say it, maybe this searing guilt in her gut that she’d made all her own problems Rio’s too, the bone crushing pain at seeing Rio hurt.</p><p>As Rio opens her eyes, tears fall. It isn’t wrecked sobs, just floating streams curved against the angles of her face, tendrils of a river flowing with the current.</p><p>Agatha can’t help the way her own thumb seeks to cover them, brush away the wet tears. She yearns to press kisses against the streaks, but she settles for her fingertips pressing away the trails.</p><p>Rio’s hand moves off her face then, giving Agatha more room to tend to her, instead it lands on Agatha’s hip, a touch that causes her to squirm slightly.</p><p>“Agatha” Rio always says her name like she is a saint. The saint that bears her name, St. Agatha, the patron saint of martyrs. Rio makes her feel like she can be good, like she can heal, like this suffering can lead to more than death.</p><p>Agatha can’t help the flicker of her eyes toward Rio’s lips, entranced by the way her lips wrap around the syllables of her name.</p><p>”Agatha,” Rio says her name again, trying to get her attention, bringing her blue eyes back to meet endless brown, almost black now that the sun has set, Rio’s fingers dig into her hip, something of a command to focus but it only makes her chest thrum harder, her eyes burning, her pulse ringing through her head.</p><p>“Rio” Agatha responds soft and asking, her eyes fall back down to her lips but this time her fingers follow, her thumb tracing the underside of Rio’s lower lip, it was charged, something close to a declaration. At the very least, Rio knew now that Agatha had thought about her lips in a way that didn’t exactly spell out ‘platonic friendship’.</p><p>Downstairs. There’s a thud. Sudden and loud.</p><p>”Fuck” is Rio’s next word, pushing up from the bed, almost knocking their heads together.</p><p>Agatha can’t speak, the ache of a chance lost doing its best to settle in. As many times as Agatha had convinced herself that nothing would ever happen between them, the sting of reality was something her brain was struggling to compute.</p><p>So she stands with Rio, paralleling the rigid speed, she fidgets with her hands, her hair, the seam of her shirt, as she watches Rio pull on her shoes, not caring that the tongues of her Vans are shoved into her toes, the laces undone.</p><p>“Rio” the whisper is gruff, an attempt at anger in the low volume, the fear coming out clearer than anything else.</p><p>Rio is already through the window, yet to climb down.</p><p>“It’s okay,”she whispers like it's the only thing she’s certain of, “I’ll see you tomorrow”</p><p>Agatha has no choice but to believe her.</p>

<p>Colossians 3:20- Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the lord. </p><p> </p><p>Rio is already through the window, yet to climb down. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay,”she whispers like it's the only thing she’s certain of, “I’ll see you tomorrow”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha has no choice but to believe her.</p><p> </p><p>The next thing she hears is her mother’s voice calling her name, she tries to determine how distant it sounds, calculate the number of seconds she has before Evanora is looking into her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Evanora yells her name for the second time, “I’ve broken a glass, grab me the broom.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whips around pushing away the raw feelings of Rio, this trepid ocean, a blister opening in the wake of being so close to that heat, but never finding the balm to cover it. She hops to her bedroom door, swinging it open against the worry that it would squeak, pleading that it will be back in its rightful position before Evanora could ever know it had been closed at all. </p><p> </p><p>She is half way through a sigh, relief at the way the hinges don’t creak from the movement, but the rest is swallowed. Evanora stands at the bottom of the stairs, her eyes boring up at Agatha as she stands in the threshold between her room and the staircase, hand tellingly still placed on the handle.</p><p> </p><p>’Fuck’ Agatha curses in her head, her ability to swallow down her sailor mouth in front of her mother something she’d practiced for years. </p><p> </p><p>What helped too was the fire in Evanora’s eyes, that split into madness that rendered Agatha frozen. Five or seventeen, it was always the same. Agatha knew she’d fucked up and her mind had already started to shut down, remove herself from her brain to protect herself. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had to give her credit, for a middle aged woman, Evanora sure could run up the stairs, maybe spurred on by rage, but spurred nonetheless. </p><p> </p><p>The warmth of Rio was suddenly vacant as everything fell into deceleration. Evanora was in front of her in an instant. At first it was a push, enough to knock her off her balance for a moment, the true intention for Evanora to see inside her room, find the reason Agatha had closed the door in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha lets her, takes the push without a word, without a groan, just stands by the door paralyzed, the weight of fear pressing her blood through her so intensely it stops her ability to move at all, to think at all. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora latches onto the now empty Dunkin bag, picking it up like it was utterly offensive. Perhaps an oversight they’d completely forgotten about when Rio was trying to leave as quickly as possible. It feels cruel now, the way this remnant of Rio’s care was being used as evidence against her. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora’s eyes find the open window, her steps launching her towards it, looking for more answers but only finding the darkness that had overtaken the night.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha thanks God that Rio hadn’t decided to stick around for whatever reason, she didn’t want Rio mixed into this, she didn’t want Rio to see the way she’d crumbled under her mother’s wrath, wanting some sick curiosity never answered. Rio didn’t need to witness this, the sullen sadness, the frozen disgrace, no attempts made at fighting back. </p><p> </p><p>“Who was in here, Agatha?” Evanora is in her face now, the paper bag crumpled in her hand. </p><p> </p><p>She can see the way her mother’s knuckles are white, the veins in her neck that pop out as she speaks, the spit of her hatred, that empty rage that fills her eyes like a monster overtaken by the devil himself. </p><p> </p><p>“Mothe-“ Agatha isn’t allowed to finish her answer, only feels the hand slap across her face, the tears in her eyes, the wrecked intensity of it all not letting her process anything properly.</p><p> </p><p>”You harlot”</p><p> </p><p>It’s piercing, the words rattling around in her brain, doing their best to find a home next to all the things her mother ever called her. </p><p> </p><p>She can feel the wall behind her, the corner securing her. She can’t feel her hands, can’t remember how to move. She feels the heat on her cheek, the air pressing deep into the healing bruise that her mother’s hand had just pressed over. It’s unbearably hot, the sweat sudden and inescapable as Evanora holds her ground. Agatha’s face is wet with tears, a new realization that passes as she tries to focus back in on the actual words Evanora is screaming. </p><p> </p><p>It feels like a slow motion effect on a movie. Agatha tries to think about Rio forcing her to watch the Matrix, always surprised at how little media Evanora allowed her to consume. She tries to think of stale popcorn tucked between them on Rio’s couch, brown eyes and the way Rio could never shut up during a movie, the complaints about the plot being cheapened by the romance element. </p><p> </p><p>It helps for a fleeting moment, the press of her best friend in her mind soft enough to wick out the truth of the present. </p><p> </p><p>She sees Evanora raise her hand again and again but she can’t lift her own to impede the impact. It’s a crash of black and white, static as her body sinks to the floor, fights to keep her blurry eyes open. Eventually, the reflex follows through, her arms coming up, not to hit back, but to protect herself. </p><p> </p><p>It tickles her in some solemn way that the natural instinct to take cover, preserve her face and vital organs always takes an extra minute to follow through, like Evanora’s abuse, her disparaging words had cut deep enough that even her own brain believed she didn't deserve to be kept alive.</p><p> </p><p>”please” she hears the echo of her own voice, a gentle plea for her mother to stop, her voice wrought and barely there, scared even now to speak out of turn, ask for something Evanora isn’t capable of providing. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha isn’t sure if her plea is heard, if her mother stops then or five minutes after.</p><p> </p><p>The feeling in her face comes back first, red and throbbing, she knows without even looking in a mirror. Her hands feel papery and unattached, her feet are asleep, the prickly pain shocking up her calves at the awkward way she’d sunken to the floor. </p><p> </p><p>She’s breathing, the shudder taking her back into reality. She tries to focus. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora isn’t here anymore. At least not in the room. </p><p> </p><p>A startling relief. The pounding in her head a flurry of a pop song rolling through her head. She thinks of Rio humming to the radio, Agatha queuing songs on Rio’s phone so she can focus on driving. The old car still using an aux cord, the calm of being in Rio’s passenger seat and trusting her to take them where they needed to be. </p><p> </p><p>The thought trapezes through her mind as she finds sleep.</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As she walks towards Rio’s car, Agatha can’t help but pull the hoodie up around her face more securely, doing her best to hide the mess of bruises she had yet to fully access in the mirror. </p><p> </p><p>Hiding, as she often did. She couldn’t mask these wounds like she had her emotions. Maybe that’s why Evanora had chosen her face as the target, forcing Agatha to wear the hurt she’d been so good at hiding her whole life. </p><p> </p><p>Seven am was usually a happy time for Agatha. Not because she was naturally a morning person, and she obviously wasn’t the biggest fan of school, but because it meant at least 10 minutes in Rio’s old beat up sedan, the paint chipping off, the heater barely working, the brakes squeaking every time it rained. It meant Rio in her school issued pleated skirt, unfiltered by the outside world. The radio playing songs that felt like only theirs, a space to find solace and calm. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora always left home earlier than Agatha, leaving her daughter to walk the 30 minute distance rain, snow, or shine. But they’d always been overly cautious anyway, Rio parking four houses down, enough distance for Agatha to feel safe from prying eyes and the doorbell camera. </p><p> </p><p>The boiling embarrassment of it sank in her chest, the walk to Rio’s car feeling like rocks in her shoes, the thundering of each step as she tried to keep her expression jaded even though all she wanted to do was cry. As safe as Rio made her feel, this felt like too much, too overwhelming to face. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha gets into the passenger seat without a word, pressing away from any possible reactions from Rio. She does not look at her, only half registers the feeling of being watched, she can’t handle this, feeling like the tide is coming up over her lungs but never flowing back. </p><p> </p><p>She blinks, trying to will the pain from her right eye, the pulse of it hot and frantic. She can feel the purple of it without having to look, and for the moment she’s happier that it’s her right eye, blocked slightly from Rio’s view as long as Agatha doesn’t turn her head. </p><p> </p><p>On the verge of panic, Agatha tries to focus on the things that settle her back into the person she is without this pain. The smell of faded eucalyptus from the air freshener hanging from Rio’s rear view mirror, the dull buzz of the radio speakers since Rio had altered the settings, turning the bass all the way up when she first got the car and had never changed it back, the cold air inside the car refreshing and icy just the way Rio liked it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels Rio’s hand on her thigh, her thumb brushing over the linty texture of old sweat pants. She hates how steadying it is, how much lighter it all feels just to be next to her. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re not in uniform” Rio chirps like it’s a surprise to Agatha too, like she’s informing them both. But Agatha can hear the pain in it too. She’s still not looking at her, but Agatha knows the hoodie isn’t covering it all, knows that Rio knows she’s hurt. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hates how well Rio knows her, the way Agatha deflected from questions like ‘are you okay?’ and shut down in the wake of anyone fretting over her with pity. Agatha hates how Rio had carefully curated tactics with Agatha, how they’d worked against her stubbornness, her unwillingness to open up, had torn down the castle walls over and over.</p><p> </p><p>She hated how Rio never got tired of fighting through it either, was annoyingly patient in hurdling the walls to Agatha’s heart, pulling at rare strings until Agatha’s resolve was untied. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m trying to get expelled” Agatha's voice is hollow, a strong attempt at sarcasm that would work on anyone else. </p><p> </p><p>“Mmmm” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t take the warmth of Rio’s hand on her, but she doesn’t have the strength to push her away either. </p><p> </p><p>She picks up Rio’s hand, examining her fingers, tracing the edges of her blunt nails, picks at stained blue ink around her thumb. Rio lets her. Lets her have this crushed second of collapse, wrinkle the timeline just enough to grant Agatha a moment to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>”Let me see,” comes from Rio’s mouth like a revenant whisper and Agatha knows she’s crying before she turns her head to look at her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio loosens her hand from Agatha’s grip to gently tug at Agatha’s chin, the fingers pulling her gently to look at her, giving her all the freedom to pull away, all the time for Agatha to tell her ‘no’. </p><p> </p><p>Brown eyes only darken as she traces them over Agatha’s face, there’s a weight of despair in her brown irises that Agatha can’t fully grasp onto. Silent tears slide down Rio’s cheeks, eyebrows furrowed, the creases of her face setting ridged against the burden of emotion. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha remembers when Rio’s grandfather died, how she held her hand the entire service, how she cried into her shoulder, how Rio was different for a long time after, how the grief had somehow morphed into who she was. This expression was reminiscent of that, the soaring pain mixed with something else. Agatha couldn’t exactly say what though.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m so sorry”</p><p> </p><p>Guilt, Rio felt guilty. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart shattered at the realization, the lurch in her stomach, the stale taste in her mouth, it felt like she was losing whatever hold she had left on consciousness, like this could only be a nightmare, that she’d have to shake herself awake. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was here, painting herself as the devil, when Rio was only ever a chorus of angels. Rio dreaming herself up as Judas. Rio could only ever be Simon, helping Jesus carry the cross. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio, you didn’t do this to me,” It’s firm and solid and it’s all the certainty she can offer.</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles around her tears, dejected, a disappointment in herself, a disbelief.</p><p> </p><p>”You shouldn’t be the one trying to comfort me right now”</p><p> </p><p>But it’s all Agatha wants to do, hold Rio’s hands in hers, pull her closer, rest the full weight of her body into her until there is no place to run, let Rio cry for not being able to protect her, whisper reassurances in her ear, remind them both just how unfair all this was, that this was never Rio’s fault. </p><p> </p><p>She can’t. </p><p> </p><p>The burden of it swallowing her. Her refusal to let it swallow Rio too. Because there was no fixing this, just waiting and wishing, and hoping time passed quick enough for her to go to college, get the fuck out of that house alive. Evanora was only getting worse, and maybe she was right, maybe she shouldn’t see Rio, shouldn’t drag her into this unwinnable war.</p><p> </p><p>”I can’t do this”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt like a traitor as soon as the words came out, scared of how the world would keep turning without continuing their routine, the silent promise that Rio would always be there after the hurricanes of maternal rage, that Rio had been buying concealer way too pale for her own skin for years, the practiced truth of Rio holding her up like crutches, pressing care into her like bandaids over scrapes, looking at her like she was worth all the emotional turmoil if it meant there was a chance she’d be okay. But she couldn’t let Rio keep looking at her like she was broken, like Rio had let it happen under her watch. She opens the passenger door, determined to walk away. </p><p> </p><p>And she does.</p><p> </p><p>She gets back to the side walk, a brisk walk of 4 steps or so before Rio is out of her car and following her. She hears the engine turn off, the slam of the driver’s side door, Rio’s gruff, an anger she’s never seen her wear. But she doesn’t turn back, knows the hurt in Rio’s eyes will be too much to bear. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha please don’t do this”</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t expect Rio to sound so broken, her brain still convinced of her mother’s scathing words that she will never be good enough to love, that she’s never been worth chasing after. But the crack in Rio’s voice, the harsh footsteps that echo behind her, Agatha can feel the devastation.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns back towards her abruptly, the anger, the fear, this deep seeded insecurity that she’ll let Rio in, love her with everything, and that Rio will still walk away in the end. It’s easier to end it now, before she knows what Rio’s lips feel like on hers, before she let’s herself sink so deep that she’ll never be able to swim back to the surface. She knows she won’t be able to handle the rejection, better to cut the red string of fate now. Save them both the trouble.</p><p> </p><p>”Go the fuck to school, Rio” Agatha knows it’s harsh and she means it to be, needs to get the fuck away from here now. </p><p> </p><p>But Rio doesn’t stop coming towards her, the hurt and determination swirling in black irises, Agatha can she the way Rio is shaking, the way she’s still trying despite the fear, a bravery Agatha is jealous of. </p><p> </p><p>A coward, always a fucking coward. </p><p> </p><p>Rio grabs her, wraps her up into this bone crushing hug, bordering on tackle level strength, it almost knocks the wind out of her. The suddenness, the sharp shame at being so easily caught only whips out more frustration.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha fights back and Rio would be stupid to assume anything less. Agatha tries to scratch at her, wiggle out of the grip, she pulls furiously at the back of Rio’s blazer, jostles her legs in an attempt to push them both into a nearby bush, her futile attempts only making her groan, the hot tears on her own cheeks pour out as her first sign of defeat.</p><p> </p><p>”Stop, Agatha, just stop” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hates how calming Rio’s voice is. Agatha hates that she listens, her body finally going slack against Rio, her hands tugging her closer now suddenly out of her control. </p><p> </p><p>Stop. Stop running from me. Stop trying to save me from you. You are not the monster. </p><p> </p><p>It sings in her brain without Rio having to say it, the way they slide together without thought, Agatha’s face buried into her neck, Rio’s hands securely supporting her weight. </p><p> </p><p>Rio presses a delicate kiss against Agatha’s hairline, it feels like a reinstatement of their promise. </p><p> </p><p>“Can we please get back in the car?” The anger in Rio’s voice is gone now, replaced by something fragile, something waning. </p><p> </p><p>“You should go to school,” Agatha’s voice is free of malice now too, the sentiment still stands that she doesn’t want to make Rio’s life any harder. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not leaving you”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls away slightly, Rio loosening her grip enough to let the movement happen freely, seemingly trusting her enough to not make another escape attempt. Agatha takes a moment to look at Rio, the tears in her eyes no longer falling, but still so full of sorrow, the pink shade around her irises, the swollen eyelids. </p><p> </p><p>She thinks of last night. Before the storm. Rio in her bed, looking at her like more than just a friend, feeling safe in the unknown, this security blanket of Rio that still held her steady on the precipice of change. It made her feel brave. Like Rio gave her the strength to try and fail. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t kiss her, not now. </p><p> </p><p>She gives a small nod, an indication that she wasn’t pushing Rio away. She was ready. </p><p> </p><p>Rio all but puts her back in the passenger seat, closes the door after she’s sure all her limbs are safely inside. It only takes Rio a second to be back in the driver’s seat but the empty air feels stale, a moment where all Agatha has is the throbbing of her eye and the hope that she’ll be okay. </p><p> </p><p>“Lemme just call my mom, tell her I’m not going to school,” Rio adds in as she pulls away from the curb. Agatha tries not to compare it, especially when the Vidals had been extremely good to her, but it still made her feel an echo of envy. Rio could tell her parents anything at any time and they’d always only been understanding. </p><p> </p><p>The explanation Rio might give her mother for skipping school doesn’t exactly cross Agatha’s mind until Mrs. Vidal’s voice comes through the phone after only ringing twice. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you alright, chispita?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha held onto the care of it, the way Rio’s mother always spoke to her daughter like she was a gift. The nickname they’d given Rio as a child “little spark” still in use today, the fact that they cared not only because they were family, but loved Rio enough to be invested in her personality, in who she was to the world.</p><p> </p><p>What Agatha doesn’t recognize is the hesitation in Rio’s voice, the way she looks to Agatha briefly, her eyes straying away before she moves to answer her mother’s question. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, mama. Ummm…” </p><p> </p><p>“What is it, Rio?” Her mother asks, no bite in it, just looking for clarification, reading the stalling in her daughter’s tone with no difficulty. </p><p> </p><p>“Purple socks,” Rio says nervously, but her mother’s reaction only reaffirms that it’s not her mother she’s worried about.</p><p> </p><p>”Okay, text me if you need anything”</p><p> </p><p>It takes a minute for Agatha’s brain to catch up. </p><p> </p><p>Purple socks? What the fuck did that mean? A code word? For…?</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t process the last few seconds of the phone conversation, the blind rage settling back in. </p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck was that?” Are her words, but she doesn’t know how they’re coming out of her mouth, her fists winded tightly in her lap, finding the strength to not resort to violence before she has all the answers to her questions (also Rio’s driving and she’d never forgive herself for dying a virgin).</p><p> </p><p>”Agath-“</p><p> </p><p>”What the fuck does ‘purple socks’ mean, Rio?” </p><p> </p><p>There’s a partial imprint of a memory somewhere in the back of her mind, filed somewhere in the Rio stack, unorganized, unsure. A purple pair of socks Rio’s parents gifted her for Christmas the first year of their friendship.</p><p> </p><p>She wants to believe that Rio had kept her promise, that she wouldn’t tell anyone about Evanora, about the abuse, but here she was explaining something to her mother in code, the meaning of it so implicitly understood.</p><p> </p><p>”It just means you need me, I’m with you and we’re safe, that’s it Agatha,” Rio tries to explain like it's so simple, like the truth of Agatha’s life isn’t a secret tragedy, like the world knowing of her placated shame was worth a celebration. </p><p> </p><p>“You told them,” Agatha scoffs, not believing it fully, wishing she hadn’t put all of her into this intoxicating trust, hoping with everything that Rio was the only good she had. </p><p> </p><p>She hated this, hated how she couldn’t process the conflict of it, hated that she’d made Rio keep the secret in the first place. She hated her own anger, this crippling frustration that she knew Rio didn’t deserve to have to carry this reality all by herself, that her life had scared her enough to make a safe word with her parents if anything ever went wrong. It was endearing, if Agatha didn’t feel entirely betrayed. </p><p> </p><p>“Let me out of the car,” Agatha demands, her hand coming to unbuckle herself, reaching for the handle. </p><p> </p><p>“Dude, stop,” Rio takes her right hand off the wheel, trying to stop Agatha from opening the door, the vehicle still very much in motion. </p><p> </p><p>In the scramble of it, Rio ends up pulling over a moment later. As soon as the car comes to a stop, Agatha moves to get out, but Rio doesn’t let her get far, her arms circling around her waist from inside, tugging her back down into the seat. </p><p> </p><p>Rio keeps her in place, Agatha straining against her, she musters the strength to lean over the console (and Agatha) to pull the passenger down shut, recreate the barrier in hopes it’s one more thing Agatha has to get through to escape. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you done?” Rio remarks clearly annoyed that Agatha is still trying to break out of Rio’s hold. </p><p> </p><p>It would be funny in another life. Rio holding onto both of Agatha’s wrists as she tried to pull them from her grasp with no luck, the intense pout on her face never leaving as she heaved her body toward the door, Rio undeterred and unimpressed by her best efforts.</p><p> </p><p>In another life. Where Agatha’s face wasn’t royally fucked up. Where Rio could kiss her without fear of her mother hearing them. Where Rio didn’t have to hold onto her heavy secrets at all. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pouts up at her, halting her movements as their eyes meet again. </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs, the edge of an explanation on her tongue and an Agatha who is half willing to listen. </p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t say anything to them,” there’s this urgent coating to the words, a reminder in the way she’d heard Rio lie before, to nuns, to peers, and this wasn’t it, “They kind of guessed, not exactly what was going on, but that something was off. We made a code word, just in case. They didn’t pry for anything else, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stares at her, trying to decide if this is the exact truth, trying to kill her own bias, weigh out whether she trusts Rio because it’s reality or because she’s already wrapped around her finger, entranced with this person to a degree that she can’t separate earnest logic from simply following what she wants to believe. </p><p> </p><p>It’s a pointless attempt, Rio looking at her like her heart is open on the table, outside of her body, a show of how far she’s willing to go to keep her safe. </p><p> </p><p>It bleeds her, breaks free a new library of self-hatred, the grief in Rio’s eyes that Agatha had pressed into them with her own trembling hands. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wants to kiss her, apologize for the weapons she’s forged against Rio’s heart out of fear, sing of the gold Rio should be adorned with, replace the heavy armor she never needed to wear. </p><p> </p><p>For all the hard fought wars, Agatha would never believe she deserved to be saved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>Proverbs 31:30-Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.</p><p> </p><p>Looking in the mirror had always felt like an act of rebellion, a calloused hand keeping her eyes open to stare at the truth of her face. Even when it wasn’t bruised and aching, Agatha had always been taught that she was nothing special, that flaunting things that weren’t her relationship with God were not only frowned upon, but strictly forbidden. The no makeup rule had come before Agatha really knew what it was, never had a chance to use it. </p><p> </p><p>She’d experiment in Rio’s stockpile, a collection consisting of several barely touched palettes of eye shadows and bronzer. She’d let Rio put eyeliner on her once or twice before deciding it didn’t suit her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha liked having the space to try it out, had let Rio make her into art several times in a way that wasn’t just for covering up bruises. It felt powerful and delicate, the appeal of it not just being the way Rio had to be so close to apply lipstick on her. </p><p> </p><p>And she loved Rio’s eyes, maybe just a little bit more when they were framed with mascara, the “natural” look she’d wear to school most days to cover any pending pimples. </p><p> </p><p>It felt like an escape, an expression of the type of person she wanted other’s to see her as, something she could have full control over. </p><p> </p><p>Another thing Evanora had taken from her. </p><p> </p><p>Looking in the mirror now felt like an axe coated in honey, a slow moving ripple of anger, the urge to weep but the numb blocking out the chances of rain. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s bathroom is small, a tiny square connected to her bedroom. The walls are blue gray, the towels, the shower curtain, the bath mat are all pale green. The soap dispenser is shaped like a dinosaur, something Rio’s had since childhood and refused to get rid of. The hairbrush on the sink, the water splatter on the mirror, the stray chunk of toothpaste by the drain. All evidence of existence, a place all Rio, tracks that Agatha was never allowed to leave in her own home. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s avoided this as long as possible, as she usually does, taking her time before having to access the damage. The bruise on her right eye isn’t the worst she’s ever seen, the purple of it sweeping under her eye, a streak of bruise along the bone there, tailing over the top of her eye lid. The swelling color something like eyeshadow. There’s dried blood just outside her nostril, something easy to miss, the dried stickiness a feeling she’d numbed out until now. Her cheekbone still stings, the redness pale against the swirl of harsher bruises. On her left brow, a split of skin, perhaps from the impact of skin pressing tight enough to break. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think you need stitches, so that’s good news,” Rio voices casually when she sees Agatha eyeing the wound in the mirror, she knows how to walk this line of commentary, not scaring Agatha away with too much at once, no pity, just attention. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s just come back from the hall closet, she places the brown bottle of hydrogen peroxide on the sink, before opening a drawer underneath, finding a pack of round cotton pads.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t sit on the sink, their natural heights giving Rio the perfect vantage point to clean the cut above her eyebrow. They stand close, Agatha’s back pressed to the sink, Rio licking her lips, focusing on pressing an adequate amount of peroxide into the cotton. </p><p> </p><p>Her hand comes up to Agatha’s neck, the tips of her fingers brushing just behind her ear, an effort to hold her steady. Agatha knows this. Knows that Rio is holding on like always, that as easy as it would be to kiss her, she never does. </p><p> </p><p>Rio searches her eyes, a practiced gaze of neutrality that Agatha can see right through. There’s the hurt right there in brown irises, the barely there way they grow darker, the slight curve of her eyebrows. It feels like yearning, something like Agatha’s reflected back. </p><p> </p><p>Rio won’t kiss her, not now. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s gonna sting,” Rio warns, a gentle calm that Agatha can’t process, the explicit care she never received as a child.</p><p> </p><p>”I know,” Agatha rolls her eyes, a deflection from the butterflies.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles a little in reaction, happy at least to get some reaction out of Agatha, knowing she hit a nerve. </p><p> </p><p>But she presses forward, tilting Agatha’s head down slightly, pushing up on her tippy toes for just a second, settling back down half an inch closer before actually touching the cotton to Agatha’s skin. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha closes her eyes, the pain of it jumping back to life, almost as if the adrenaline had finally worn off. Rio’s fingers stroke the side of her neck, an instant attempt at comfort. </p><p> </p><p>Being this close to Rio sparks her heart beat, a magnetism of silver linings. A place under Rio’s hands that felt like an umbrella in a rainstorm, a place to rest when she’d only ever been running in fear. She sets her wrists against Rio’s hips without much thinking.</p><p> </p><p>She blames it on the pain, the need to hold on to something. It is not because she’s dreamed of tracing every surface of Rio’s skin, it is not because Agatha could live in this moment forever. </p><p> </p><p>Still, she revels in the fact that Rio doesn’t seem to pull away, focused on cleaning away specks of dry blood and making sure it won’t get infected. Agatha opens her eyes to look at her again, hesitating for a breath, unsure if she could be this close and not combust. </p><p> </p><p>Rio finishes just as Agatha finds her eyes again, the stare of it so soft. Agatha feels Rio’s finger twitch against her neck, maybe involuntary, the thread of a desire to pull her closer, a droplet of fear pressed into her forehead. </p><p> </p><p>“Let me get a bandaid”</p><p> </p><p>It’s hushed, a sentence just for the space between them, a loss as Rio pulls away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio secures it without much fuss, sticking it over the cut, an ease in the way Rio put all her focus into things that mattered, clumsy everywhere else. She helps Agatha clean the blood from under her nose, a wet rag wiping it away. </p><p> </p><p>“We should ice your eye,” Rio paints their next direction, suddenly rushing out of the bathroom to put the hydrogen peroxide back. Agatha hates that Rio’s words portray it as a “them” problem, that Rio includes herself in the need to heal her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t know what she would do if Rio didn’t actively try to lessen her burden, even through small gestures like this, it felt like a weight they could carry together.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio leaves the bathroom, she misses the proximity, the electricity of Rio’s hands. But the emptiness in her heart doesn’t settle back in, this room so Rio-coated, her energy still keeping Agatha up right as she walks away. </p><p> </p><p>“Let me change quick,” Rio chirps, her face toward the closet, clothes spilling out from the bottom, the door not being able to close for several years. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha busies herself trying to look away, her peripheral catching the way Rio tugs off her blazer, pulls down her skirt. She closes her eyes again, pressing away the thoughts of soft skin, the curve of thighs, the dull ridges of her rib cage. </p><p> </p><p>She only turns around at the sound of Rio stepping back towards her, the taller girl now in an old gray Paramore tshirt and basketball shorts she’s rolled up too high. She’s mid way through tying her hair up, an effortless little bun, the stray edges in the front purposely left out. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s kitchen isn’t extravagant, the house itself smaller than Agatha’s but somehow always feeling so much fuller. There are always fresh flowers on the table, a gift from her father to her mother every time the last batch dies, a symbol of the continued effort to support a marriage. The table itself worn and scratched, the table legs wobbly on one side, evidence of years of shared meals. Dishes sit drying next to the sink, Rio’s favorite mug, a wide orange coffee cup covered in fall leaves that she uses year round, mostly to eat Froot Loops. Decorative towels with different Spanish words, a microwave with bits of splattered tomato sauce, magnets on the fridge, a birthday card from Rio to her father securely clipped to it’s metal surface. </p><p> </p><p>Rio bounds through the space like she’s unafraid, no tiptoeing, no slowing down around corners. And yes, her parents aren’t home, but Rio moves just as freely when they are. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha idly wonders what that’s like: existing in a home that felt comfortable enough to sail through, open drawers loudly, rummage through the pantry, leave dishes in the sink without worry. </p><p> </p><p>“You okay?” Rio asks like it’s not a loaded question, like they haven’t spent the last hour trying to piece Agatha back together, like her silence isn’t warranted.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe it’s not with Rio, Agatha always willing to speak in front of her, the filter of her sliding away with Rio, a safety she’d been reaching to for the past four years.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hesitates, waits for Rio to put two Uncrustables in the air fryer (she swears they taste best that way), return her attention back to her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sits at the kitchen island, the marble counter enacting at least five feet between them, Rio on the other side, grabbing two water bottles from the fridge. It’s that seamless care that never makes its way into conversation, the immediate inclusion of her, like it was not a possibility to Rio that she wouldn’t automatically provide Agatha with a meal (even if it was just a childhood delicacy), more than she could say about her own mother. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I just…”</p><p> </p><p>But, Agatha trails off, unsure of her own thoughts, unsure of the truth. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her, seeming to suddenly remember the black eye, maybe it's a good excuse to not push Agatha to speak when she isn’t ready, maybe it’s Rio changing the subject for them both. </p><p> </p><p>“Ice!” She turns back around, opening the freezer, “Corn okay? I don’t think we have an ice pack”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just reaches out her hand, a signal for Rio to pass it over, her eyes done with the whole situation, her heart beating harder at the way Rio seemed caught up in the worry of frozen corn doing an adequate job. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha basically slaps the bag to her face, the crunch of it making Rio wince. </p><p> </p><p>“Dude, be careful”</p><p> </p><p>”It’s already fucked up, how much more damage could I really do?” Agatha shrugs. </p><p> </p><p>“I’d like both your eyes to stay functional, so chill out,” Rio answers without thought as she opens the air fryer, trying her best to keep up the conversation while grabbing the food out with her bare hands. </p><p> </p><p>“Says the one about to burn their fingers off” </p><p> </p><p>Rio just looks at her, offended, the Uncrustables still not moved. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes for good measure, a reminder that she’s getting up to prove a point, not to be helpful. She drops the bag of frozen corn onto the island without any hesitation. </p><p> </p><p>She grabs a spatula from the drawer next to the stove, knowing where they were kept from watching Rio’s mother make them tostones as after school snacks hundreds of times. </p><p> </p><p>“Make yourself useful and get me something to put them on,” Agatha shoos Rio out of her way with the spatula wielding it like a hammer she’s about to do some serious masculine work with. Rio can’t help but smile at her, the way Agatha could transform herself into this intimidating figure even though Rio knew she possessed absolutely no upper body strength. </p><p> </p><p>Rio grabs two small plates, ones that might be used for birthday cake or as tea saucers, one is a little chipped, but Agatha is always charmed by the character of it, something well-used, a remnant of family.</p><p> </p><p>She scoops the pocket sandwiches onto them with ease, a smug look meeting Rio’s soft smile. </p><p> </p><p>“You make it look so easy”</p><p> </p><p>”it is easy”</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wouldn’t admit it, but her favorite room of Rio’s house was the sun room. The wide windows let in so much light, a glowing ambiance of dull orange from sunrise to sunset. There were too many plants to count, small cacti and winding vines, orchids and a hydrangea bush. She’d absolutely never admit that it was her favorite because of the way Rio always lit up in here, the way Rio could spend hours here taking care of the all the plants, would talk about each one and how it had been growing steadily, watered each one to a specification that Agatha had no clue how she remembered. </p><p> </p><p>It felt like an extra door to knowing all of Rio, a place where Rio could speak clearly, say the things she would never say anywhere else. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha remembers freshman year, mid January. She was fourteen and Evanora would never let her have sleepovers. The ever growing fear of life itself had cracked open just enough when her mother was away for a principal’s conference several states away. It was a weekend and Agatha thanked God Rio’s parents agreed without asking to speak to her mother. </p><p> </p><p>They’d decided to sleep in the sun room, sleeping bags and snacks, an idea from Rio when Agatha had told her she’d never been camping. Rio roasted marshmallows over the flame of the stove in the kitchen, Agatha watched with astonishment, envious of the way Rio seemed to take normal teenage risks, unafraid of the smoke alarm going off at 1 in the morning with her parents asleep upstairs. </p><p> </p><p>It was then that Agatha realized how safe she felt with Rio. There had always been this pull, the butterflies, the way Agatha would lose her thoughts the first few times they’d spoken. But it was then, 5 months into friendship, that Agatha knew this was home, Rio was the place to land when nothing else felt right. </p><p> </p><p>It was that night in their sleeping bags, Rio still had chocolate on the corner of her mouth, her eyes starting to close when Agatha started to speak. </p><p> </p><p>“Can I tell you something?” She turned on her side to face Rio. </p><p> </p><p>And the sleep in Rio’s eyes suddenly vanishes, replaced by something so open and delicate. </p><p> </p><p>“Of course”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha relishes in the way there’s no fear in Rio’s words, but almost wishes there was, almost wishes she had better prepared her for impact. </p><p> </p><p>“Remember a few months ago, when my lip was busted open”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyebrows furrow, maybe confusion at why Agatha was bringing it up, the pain there as well, at the memory of her friend in pain. Rio’s eyes trace over her bottom lip, finding comfort in the way the skin had healed. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you said you slipped and hit it on the bathroom counter”</p><p> </p><p>”I lied” Agatha confesses, but doesn’t continue right away, she waits for Rio to be mad, to question it, to tell her to leave. She waits for God’s wrath, waits for all the unholy consequences. </p><p> </p><p>But Rio just waits for her, holding out for an explanation. It’s in this moment too, that Agatha decides Rio is too good for her.</p><p> </p><p>”My mother,” Agatha breathes, sinking further into her sleeping bag minutely. “She hit me with a hanger” her eyes close, unable to look at Rio as the words spill out. It feels like pulling the trigger. “You can’t tell anyone” the words are so small, barely there as Agatha’s eyes no longer listen to her harsh pleas to not cry.</p><p> </p><p>The first thing she feels is Rio shift closer, she isn’t holding her, but their sleeping bags are now close enough that Rio’s thighs push against her. </p><p> </p><p>“The bruise you had on your cheek the first day of school?” Rio’s voice is so soft, an attempt at a question, trying to put all the pieces together. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had once told her that the bruise was one of the reasons she approached her that day, that she’d thought maybe Agatha was the type to wrestle with boys or climb trees without fearing how to get back down, that the thought intrigued her. Another bit of shame that Rio had waltzed into her life because of Evanora. </p><p> </p><p>“The broken finger?” Rio asked another question when Agatha doesn’t answer the first one, Agatha’s eyes opening finally.</p><p> </p><p>She just nods slowly, her eyes not meeting Rio’s, so afraid of the hurt that might be reflected there, unable to see her like that. Agatha was shaking, her arms wrapped around herself, the warmth of the room, of Rio beside her not enough to push away the adrenaline. </p><p> </p><p>“You can’t tell anyone”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally finds her eyes in the dark when Rio doesn’t respond, finally realizes just how close they are. It’s shattering and comforting all at once, the way Rio looks at her like she doesn’t know what to do, what to say, the way Rio is bolted into her side, not running away. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s arm comes out of her sleeping bag, she presses her hand over Agatha’s shoulder, a squeeze that morphs into a delicate stroke of her thumb. The touch alone is enough to settle some of her fraying nerves. </p><p> </p><p>She watches the conflict in Rio’s eyes, her care for Agatha eclipsed by the pain that her friend had suffered through this all alone. Rio bites her lip, trying her best to settle on the right decision. </p><p> </p><p>“I won’t tell anyone”</p><p> </p><p>Sitting in the same room, four years later felt like a different lifetime with all the same themes. They were still those people, wrapped up in the same trauma, but time had made it feel eerily distant. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was sat on the sofa with her legs crossed, the frozen bag of corn was half melted and put back in the freezer for now. Her face still felt hot and sore, a prickling itch from the cut on her brow bone. </p><p> </p><p>The TV was on, an old flat screen that turned on and off without prompting sometimes (Rio always blamed it on ghosts). It was an old rerun of an SVU episode, a show Rio had been exposed to way too young, and Agatha had only known about since being her friend. It was more background noise than anything as Agatha was currently using one of Rio’s coloring books, stealing her good markers to color in a picture of SpongeBob and Patrick jellyfishing. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was on the floor laying on her stomach, propped up on her elbows with her feet in the air, focused on her own image, a way more detailed color by number book of famous paintings. Agatha wasn’t sure how Rio possessed the core strength to lay like that for over an hour, how she possessed the patience to color such small spaces of Starry Night. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks up at her, catching her staring, a game they no longer tease each other for. Rio had stopped calling her out on it a long time ago, Agatha didn’t know why. Maybe it was easier that way, Agatha never giving her an explanation for it anyway. </p><p> </p><p>“Can you stop hogging the blues?” Rio says instead of anything else. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not hogging them,” Agatha throws two markers, both shades of blue, both bouncing off of Rio’s hip, definitely not one of the places Agatha was staring at, the way her t-shirt rode up just enough to expose skin. </p><p> </p><p>Rio turns her body enough to snatch them from the carpet where they landed, giving Agatha a glare as she turns. </p><p> </p><p>“Last time I checked SpongeBob is yellow, so you shouldn’t need these anyway” Rio continues, obviously not done with the banter. She uncaps her marker and focuses back on her book. </p><p> </p><p>“The water is blue, dork”</p><p> </p><p>Rio flops onto her side suddenly, the task at hand seemingly forgotten for the moment. </p><p> </p><p>“Now Agatha, are those words truly fit for a woman of God to use?” Rio asks, doing her best impression of the most snobby nuns they’d encountered. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, lying is a sin, Rio. And you are definitely a dork.” Agatha hides her chuckle, secretly loving the way they could maintain this back and forth without hurting each other’s feelings. </p><p> </p><p>“Doesn’t mean you have to be rude,” Rio is sitting up now, the markers forgotten on the carpet, the pout on her face something both juvenile and alluring, lips that call out to Agatha like a sign from the heavens. </p><p> </p><p>“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor,” Agatha quotes Exodus to make her point, not because she truly believes lying is the worst possible action to take, but more for the sake of disagreeing with Rio, more for the hope that it gets under Rio’s skin. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, Wanda,” Rio teases, bringing up their classmate as a purposeful dig at her unending need to stitch scripture through everyday conversations.</p><p> </p><p>It reminds Agatha of yesterday, of the way Rio seemed so thrown by the topic of homosexuality, she tries to push it away. </p><p> </p><p>”Okay, comparing me to Wanda is wild”</p><p> </p><p>”Eh, I know you look up to her,” Rio shrugs, teasing a little further before laughing, unable to stay serious at the absurdity of her own words.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just squints at her, willing herself to not fall harder at the sight of Rio innocently laughing at her own joke, the quiet joy of it.</p><p> </p><p>”Don’t make me throw the rest of the markers at you.”</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Luke 8:17- For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, and nothing concealed that will not be known and come to light.</p><p> </p><p>The barrel of cheese balls is something Evanora would never allow inside her house. A gluttonous snack that offered absolutely no nutritional value. It sits on Agatha’s lap, sat in a lawn chair in Rio’s backyard. There’s a small garden to her right, a fence that surrounds the back half of the house, green grass kept manicured, a grill. </p><p> </p><p>There’s other chairs available around the table, but Rio is standing a few feet away trying to catch cheese balls in her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha has pretty good aim, but it wouldn’t matter either way, Rio fully committed to diving to the floor if it means successfully catching the snack. </p><p> </p><p>“Slow down, I’m still chewing,” Rio speaks around the two she’d caught one after the other, Agatha’s hand already loaded with the next. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorts at the gross orange slime stuck to Rio’s teeth, she pops the cheese ball into her own mouth, shaking her head at the activities they considered fun. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know how you’re still alive with all the crap you ingest,” Agatha notes, seeing as how she’s at least 30 cheese balls in with no signs of stopping. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re just jealous my stomach is indestructible,” Rio flexes like she’s Superman, a definite power pose. Agatha tries her best not to look at the soft muscles of her biceps, the veins in her forearms. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, super dork” Agatha throws another cheese ball, more like a fast ball than a lob.</p><p> </p><p>Rio slaps it away instead of attempting a catch that she wasn’t ready for, the orange puff falling into the grass.</p><p> </p><p>”Why you so mean to me?” Rio pouts again, but Agatha knows this is par for the course of their dynamic, Agatha only comfortable enough to be sarcastic with Rio, the only person she feels safe enough to joke with. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t act like you don’t like it,” Agatha smirks.</p><p> </p><p>”dONt aCt lIKE yOU DOnt liKE It,” Rio mocks her words, scurrying towards her, her hands already out in warning, Agatha knows what’s coming.</p><p> </p><p>”If you tickle me, I will kill you,” She threatens Rio, a handful of cheese balls at the ready for ammo to protect her. </p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” Rio relents easily, “only cuz you asked nicely,” she winks before turning away, and Agatha has to swallow down the way her mouth waters. </p><p> </p><p>When she comes out of her moment of weakness, Rio has bent down to pick up the cheese ball she’d unceremoniously hit to the ground.</p><p> </p><p>”Jesus, Rio please don’t eat that”</p><p> </p><p>”I’m not,” Rio instantly defends herself, “Don’t want a squirrel to get it and get sick, his stomach ain’t as strong as mine,” she voices her explanation like a child trying to save a dying butterfly, placing it onto the table to discard later. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, I’m ready,” Rio starts again a few moments later, stepping back, getting into position like she was next at bat and Agatha was the pitcher. </p><p> </p><p>“Hmmm, I think you need to earn it,” Agatha teases now, maybe a little annoyed at Rio having the upper hand, that wink doing more than she’d like to admit. </p><p> </p><p>“How do I earn it?” Rio chirps back almost too easily convinced to play along with whatever game Agatha had concocted. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll ask you a question, a correct answer gets you a cheese ball,” Agatha shrugs, the rules clearly on the table.</p><p> </p><p>”Fine, ask your questions,” Rio tries to appear annoyed by it, but Agatha can read the amusement there. </p><p> </p><p>“What’s my favorite color?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her like she’s crazy, like Agatha had given her a free pass, like Rio knew this was a soft ball question to catch her off guard for the hard balls to come. </p><p> </p><p>“Green,” Rio smirks, purposely answering wrong to see if the only consequence was no snacks being thrown her way. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head.</p><p> </p><p>”You’re only depriving yourself,” Agatha laughs, rewarding herself with two cheese balls, as if taking the one Rio would have earned with a correct answer, teasing Rio as if the sodium intake directly translated to her worth. </p><p> </p><p>“Next question” Rio pushes forward, hands on her hips, waiting impatiently, Agatha takes an extra moment to contemplate. </p><p> </p><p>“What’s my middle name?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffs. </p><p> </p><p>“You won’t tell me!” Rio whines, “I’ve been begging you to tell me forever, this game isn’t fair”</p><p> </p><p>”Not my fault you answered both questions wrong,” Agatha giggles. </p><p> </p><p>“I change my mind, I think I am gonna tickle you,” Rio threatens but doesn't move, knowing the words are enough to get a reaction.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha throws her hands up in surrender.</p><p> </p><p>”Wait, wait, wait. Let me ask another question.”</p><p> </p><p>”Okay, go ahead,” Rio nods, thinking she’s finally got the upper hand again, waiting for a question akin to ‘what color is the sky?’ The color she’s always found in Agatha’s eyes, but no, her friend has other plans, feeling willing to take a risk. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you scared about going away for college?” Agatha asks, soft but certain, trying to focus on the orange powder coating her fingers and not the way Rio’s face falls. </p><p> </p><p>They’d had conversations like this before. Agatha had to convince Rio to dorm at a school several hours away for a better opportunity, a program more suited to her goals, even if it meant they’d be far away. She knew Rio was excited about studying botany, exploring a new city, but she could also sense the fear around it, that the independence would be a learning curve, not seeing her parents, not seeing Agatha would make everything feel empty. Rio hadn’t brought it up, especially after Agatha made it abundantly clear that she wouldn’t let Rio turn the opportunity down for her. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio’s stance changes, the gears in her mind skirting forward, the game pauses, Rio pulling out a chair and sitting in it to face Agatha, she perches herself over the edge, their knees touching, Rio looking at her like she’s about to tell a 6 year old their pet rabbit died, “I’m not going.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mind takes a moment to compute the words, settle on them as a clear destination, her eyebrows furrow, “What?” Is all she can manage, shaking her head to shake away the confusion. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to Darkhold. With you.” Rio tries to explain gently, a severed confession that rings out like a hopeful whisper, wanting Agatha to find the relief of it more than the rage.</p><p> </p><p>”Y- you can’t fucking do that,” Agatha pushes the barrel into Rio’s hands, not being able to stay still, to be this close to Rio when her friend was giving up her future for her. Rio was usually elated when Agatha cursed out loud, something special about the freedom of it, but right now, her eyes only read as contemplative, a truth that Agatha couldn’t fully read. </p><p> </p><p>She stands now, her arms crossed looking at Rio like she’d killed her first born.</p><p> </p><p>”I told you to go, Rio. I saw the acceptance letter. Why would you stay here when you can fucking escape?”</p><p> </p><p>And maybe that was the crux of it, Rio had nothing to run away from. Her family that loved and supported her was right here in West View, Darkhold University was giving her just as good of a scholarship without having to move (even if the school wasn’t as good), and Ag-</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not leaving you here alone.” Rio voices like a prayer, a plea to Agatha to see her point of view, “You’re not ruining my life, Agatha. I made this decision.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closes her eyes, the sting of surprise still jolting whenever Rio showed her how much she cared. A few tears leak out, she turns toward the sun still high in the sky, half wishing the rays would burn her into ash, rid her of all these heavy emotions. </p><p> </p><p>She feels Rio press into her from behind, her arms circling around her stomach and pulling her back into her chest, Rio’s chin settling against her shoulder. She tries to breathe, settle into Rio’s hold, commit the warmth to memory, be brave enough to not pull away when the feelings become overwhelming.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner,” Rio apologizes into her hair, a whisper for just Agatha. In truth she knew she could never stay mad at Rio, especially when they both knew the way Agatha would react, would struggle with letting Rio stay for her. </p><p> </p><p>“I can handle Evanora, it’ll be fi-“ Agatha starts to lie, a final attempt at convincing Rio.</p><p> </p><p>As much as she’d miss her, as scared as she was of being alone, of starting this new chapter without her best friend, she couldn’t clip Rio’s wings. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio cuts her off, a gentle warning, “I know you can, you are the strongest person I know, and I have no doubts about that. But, I won’t let you do this alone.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can hear in her voice that she’s holding back tears of her own, she hates it, the flow of pain that leaks from Agatha into Rio she can’t ever find how to stop. </p><p> </p><p>She turns in Rio’s arms needing to see her face, this complex care resting in brown irises, a wrecked bliss, like this battle was worth it to keep Agatha safe. </p><p> </p><p>“I hate that I can’t protect you,” Rio whispers into the air between them, her arms still around Agatha’s waist, Agatha’s hands are on her face, silently wiping at fallen tears. </p><p> </p><p>The broken rift of Rio’s voice is too much, a reminder of all the pain she’s pressed into Rio’s heart without asking. Rio looks at her like she is holy, something to bow to, a twisted bar of nickel painted to look like gold and Rio is the only one gullible enough to see the value. </p><p> </p><p>Looking at her lips, wanting her this way, its electricity, a pulse of pressure, a balloon inflating, waiting for the pop. The devil on her shoulder telling her to lean in, press further into Rio’s space, kiss her for all the times she’s dreamt of them like this. The angel on her shoulder telling her that there was too much to lose, that Rio deserved better than this.</p><p> </p><p>”Shimeath” she whispers back instead. The name of an ammonite woman in the Bible, a story of God’s judgement and revenge. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her confused, wondering how she would be relevant, but doesn’t pull away, stays like she’d wait forever for Agatha to explain.</p><p> </p><p>”My middle name,” she confesses.</p><p> </p><p>”She who hears and obeys,” Rio recalls the meaning, perhaps her memory more closely aligned with Wanda than either of them would like to admit, “I don’t think that’s fitting,” Rio looks away as if contemplating the suitability of the name. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs and it feels freeing, a press of air that makes her believe that happiness could find her somewhere, even if only in moments like this. </p><p> </p><p>“Look, not all of us can be the river of life,” Agatha teases, no bite behind it, secretly enamored by how her parents had named her something so powerful and beautiful without it feeling forced or odd. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be jealous that I have no middle name, Shimeath” Rio tests the new knowledge for the first time, knowing full well she’d be using the weapon Agatha had just willingly put into her hands. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Agatha pushes out of the embrace, offended that her good-will had so quickly turned against her, “So what we’re not gonna do is- AHHH”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrieks as Rio begins chasing her mid sentence, looking more than willing to tackle her to the ground. </p><p> </p><p>Rio catches her easily, falling to the ground less than gracefully and pulling Agatha down with her. They roll for a moment, Agatha giving up without much fight, hating how wide Rio smiled knowing she was stronger, settling facing each other, half tangled. </p><p> </p><p>“You are such a child,” Agatha looks at her grumpily, not happy to lay amongst the bugs.</p><p> </p><p>“I think you owe me some cheese balls,” Rio ignores her words, her fingers busy pulling grass out of Agatha’s hair. </p><p> </p>

<p>John 15:13- Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows better than to not come home, knows that her key turning in the door, the careful strides toward the stairs and up to her room would only breathe fire into Evanora’s eyes. </p><p> </p><p>She was meant to be seen and not heard, and as much as there were unspoken rules (staying home from school to conceal her wounds to protect Evanora’s image), the consequences to spending that time anywhere other than tucked into her bed, thinking about what she’d done to deserve it, were strictly prohibited. </p><p> </p><p>Even worse was the fact that Evanora had just established that she didn't want Agatha hanging out with Rio anymore, a truth that she hadn’t expressed to Rio for a number of reasons.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha definitely didn’t plan on pushing Rio away simply because her mother was demanding it. Especially considering Rio was the only person who made her feel worth something. </p><p> </p><p>It’s a harsh contrast, stepping out of Rio’s car, safely parked a few houses down even if Evanora isn’t due home for another 30 minutes. She tries to push away the sinking feeling of ‘goodbye’, like her home wasn’t a war zone, like high school drama could be the worst of their worries. </p><p> </p><p>Rio squeezes her hand, the look in brown irises vowing all the unspoken promises. </p><p> </p><p>it feels like retreating to her cage, the day a moment of reprieve, almost as if her master had remembered her evil and was sending her back to hell.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sinks into her bed, the pain of her bruises mostly subsided now, the dull ache something she’d come to survive through easily, she closes her eyes, trying to focus on her breathing. </p><p> </p><p>The thought of Rio always a comfort, she felt desperate for wanting more, guilty that for all Rio had done for her, it was never enough to quiet the echo of desire in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>The longing was embarrassing, this need to cross the boundaries of friendship, a tug in her heart that wanted to be entirely consumed by Rio, yet held back indefinitely by unparalleled fear. </p><p> </p><p>A plant that never grows past its stem, a bud that recedes into itself, no petals, no leaves. Agatha basks in the sunlight of Rio, taking in the heat of her touch, the warmth of her care, but too afraid to fully face it, a barrier of ozone keeping her from fully blooming. </p><p> </p><p>The contemplation only grows colder when she questions Rio’s stance, maybe Agatha had grown delusional over the years, half convinced herself that Rio must harbor some type of feelings, the way Rio was always so touchy with her, the quiet protective nature, the pained look of want, the things Agatha didn’t want to strictly file under the ‘friendship’ tab. </p><p> </p><p>But even if Rio shared these petulant feelings, she never acted on it either, perhaps wrapped up in her own fear. </p><p> </p><p>Fucking stupid. An edge they’d never leap off of for fear of leaving the other behind, caught in this tangle of unspoken words, unexplored realities, for the sake of keeping things stable. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was tired. Tired of pressing over biting wounds, cycling through the catalog of places that had been marked by unpredictable rage, fighting to find her own self worth long enough to think she deserved a life that wasn’t this one. </p><p> </p><p>But breaking her own heart with an untimely confession would only make it worse. </p><p> </p><p>She bites the inside of her cheek, pushing away the sudden desire to weep.</p><p> </p><p>She hears her mother’s key turn in the door, a quiet shuffle as she enters the house. </p><p> </p><p>Her heart slows, her breaths more even, the practiced tradition of listening to Evanora’s footsteps, trying to find the emotion in the way she carried herself. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha waits, catching the sounds with no signs of anger, the front door isn’t slammed when it closes, there doesn’t seem to be any haste in Evanora’s moments, an indication that the coast is clear for now. </p><p> </p><p>In truth, Agatha is never fully relaxed, a guarding wall pressed up in every moment, a coping mechanism that’s been in place for as long as she could remember, but there is still a press of relief that the upending doom remained lurking, not thundering full force. </p><p> </p><p>She tried to not let it sting, should have been used to the flippant disregard, the lack of mothering, but there was still this hollow feeling at the way Evanora never checked in on her, never apologized, like she truly had no care in whether Agatha lived or died. </p><p> </p><p>As much as she knew it would be just as toxic if her mother carried in fake ‘sorry’s or showered her in materialistic charms to win her favor, to keep her mouth shut about the abuse, a part of her still craved that attention. A part of her would always be that small girl wishing her mother would soothe her. </p><p> </p><p>The frustration of it swallowed her, the crushing pulse in her head lurching into a migraine. She couldn’t stomach that thought even now, that for all the harm Evanora caused her, she still wanted for the things she’d never have in this lifetime. </p><p> </p><p>Her phone buzzes underneath her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Always knowing the exact moment she needs her somehow. </p><p> </p><p>It’s an instagram notification, a post Rio shared with her.</p><p> </p><p>An illustrated image of two frogs dressed as cowboys under the words ‘me and my bestie sharing one brain cell’.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha will try to push it away, a small empty gesture of friendship. She hearts the message, trying not to mull over the perfect timing, set 5 minutes after Evanora gets home, from an art account Rio knew Agatha liked. </p><p> </p><p>Everything Rio did felt purposeful, intended and certain. It was difficult to untangle that from every instance, the ways Rio was different with Agatha, a definition of friendship or something more. Agatha could never be sure. </p><p> </p><p>She opens Rio’s story, a repost of a screenshotted tweet</p><p> </p><p>’imagine someone trying to fix themselves so they can love you exactly how you deserve to be loved’</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushes away all the attempts of reading into it, letting it fester into a meaning she can’t make into something tangible. </p><p> </p><p>She’s exhausted of the almosts, looking at Rio’s lips as she dabs makeup over her bruises, being close, reveling under Rio’s touch, Rio’s attention, but never staking claim. The knot is starting to feel suffocating, a balloon ready to burst. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Unlike English, lunch period was a time of the day she could sit through without wanting to slit a nuns throat. Forty five minutes of Rio next to her, the bench allowing them to be closer, Rio’s thigh pressed into hers from the proximity, something she didn’t question, they’re high school definitely over populated leaving few open spaces at lunch tables. </p><p> </p><p>It was hard to sit alone, be excluded from the mammoth of teenage girls, a feverish sea of dark blue pleated skirts, knee high socks, and pressed blazers. </p><p> </p><p>High school was a lot less clique-y when they all operated out of the same string of religious restrictions. Less little groups of specification and more like a spectrum from absolutely devout to girls forced here by their parents to the few stragglers who weren’t Catholic, drawn in by the status of paying an unnecessary amount in class dues. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha herself doesn’t fit in to those parameters that easily, forced here by her mother? Yep. But also floating through some sense of privilege, all the staff operating under the wrath of her mother. Something not exactly in the vein of teacher’s pet, but a taste of untouchable. Nuns weren’t exactly lining up to send her to the principal’s office. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was being too nice and Agatha was doing her best to pretend it wasn’t on the verge of making her throw up. Agatha still hadn’t fully recovered from how gentle Rio was with the concealer this morning, something more gentle than usual, like she could sense the blooming weakness, the cracks in her armor, the vulnerable whispers that said she was crashing. </p><p> </p><p>The brunette was sharing her pretzels with Agatha, nudging the open bag to be between them on the table, before starting to peel a tangerine, focusing on ridding the fruit of all the white fibers she knew gave Agatha the ick. </p><p> </p><p>They were half in a group conversation with some of their classmates around them, a consequence of being at the same table, a group they’d moved through grades with, shared classes with, something amicable, but never bonds that made it outside the walls of the school. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you think any of the Sisters have broken their sacred vows?” Alice asks conspiratorially, the conversations about ‘sins’ and sexual deviance more prevalent as they’d all gotten through puberty. </p><p> </p><p>”I doubt it,” Jen scoffs, shaking her head.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm, I don’t know, Kale. Sister Calderu seems pretty saucy,” Rio jokes, the dazzle in her eye, the easy smirk, things Agatha hangs onto. </p><p> </p><p>“I bet she lives a double life,” Alice adds picking at her celery sticks, “Choir teacher by day, dominatrix by night”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha winces at the thought of the nun in a latex suit, seeing Sister Calderu as one of the only nuns she could tolerate, picturing her in a sexual way felt like an uncle trying to kiss her on the mouth. Her reaction is a stark contrast to the way Jennifer and Rio laugh at Alice’s words. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” Jen focuses on Agatha, something teasing in her eyes, “I didn’t take baby Harkness for a prude?”</p><p> </p><p>”I’m not scandalized,” Agatha clarifies, rolling her eyes, fiddling with the pretzel between her fingers, “Just wouldn’t be my guess”</p><p> </p><p>”Who’s your guess?” Rio asks, seemingly genuinely curious as to which nun Agatha had thought might be sexually active. And Agatha knows she’s not getting out of giving an answer, Alice and Jen looking at her with the same curiosity. </p><p> </p><p>“Sister Edith,” Agatha offers, referring to their history teacher, a frail woman who had lived through a good chunk of her curriculum, seemingly enraptured in the muses of old world dictators and shifting culture. She was passionate, if not odd. </p><p> </p><p>The answer is funny, but Agatha doesn’t fully intend it to be.</p><p> </p><p>”What?” She asks when her three classmates burst out into laughter, “It’s always the unsuspecting ones who are the real freaks”</p><p> </p><p>”You talking about yourself, Harkness?” Alice bites in slightly, a teasing push that Agatha knows is harmless, an extra chip of proving herself as the principal’s daughter, someone who hadn’t exactly earned her place. </p><p> </p><p>Rio almost spits out her water at Alice’s words, a reaction Agatha can’t take the time to analyze. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Alice,” Agatha deadpans, clearly being sarcastic, “I love cutting people up, before I have my way with them”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallows at her own mistake, “people’ leaving room for an interpretation that involves more than a desire for men. She sighs relieved when no one questions it, not ready to fight that battle. </p><p> </p><p>“Really though, Harkness? Does your mother even let you around boys?” It’s Jen that pushes this time. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha breathes, settling in her mind that Jennifer’s questioning it in the semantics of being a Catholic school principal, not because she’d know anything about how little freedom Agatha was given.</p><p> </p><p>She feels Rio’s hand on her thigh, a quiet comfort, a tender reminder that her best friend could read the slightest change in her demeanor. </p><p> </p><p>“Not really,” She voices, trying to track her words somewhere neutral, not wanting to sound too okay with the fact that she seldom had to deal with snotty teenage boys under her mother’s watch. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” Alice smiles around her own gasp, “have you never been kissed?”</p><p> </p><p>”Alice,” Rio’s voice warns, before Agatha can even answer, a slight blush on Rio’s cheeks as she innately swoops in to protect Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I wanna know too,” Jen adds, defending Alice’s question. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay,” Agatha says just for Rio, a small reassurance that she didn’t need her to stop their questioning before she turns back toward Alice and Jen with a confession on her lips. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry to burst your bubble, but yes, I’ve kissed someone,” Agatha counters, shaking her head at how juvenile it feels to word it like that. </p><p> </p><p>“Who?” Jen asks.</p><p> </p><p>It’s caught between Rio’s words, “Well, that’s news to me”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha eyes Rio momentarily, willing herself to keep talking, push past the unreadable gleam in brown irises, maybe disappointment at withheld information, Rio had never given Agatha a reason to feel like she couldn’t tell her things. </p><p> </p><p>“It was while you were away at Camp, summer of Sophomore year,” Agatha gives a quick explanation, pressing back into the conversation, an opening to lay out the truth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t told Rio because it felt foreign for them to talk about things like this, she didn’t know how to tell Rio she’d had her first kiss, how to explain that it only confirmed she wasn’t into boys, how it only made her think about kissing Rio more. </p><p> </p><p>“A family friend’s son, his name was Ralph,” She confesses like she’s delivering the morning weather forecast.</p><p> </p><p>”And?” Jen pipes up.</p><p> </p><p>”And what?”</p><p> </p><p>”Was he good?” </p><p> </p><p>“God, no!” Agatha’s nose scrunches, “way too much tongue, I let him touch my boobs cuz I was bored,” Agatha says honestly. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha thanks God that the focus comes off of her after that, Alice launching into a story about a boy who almost suffocated her with his tongue, that somehow transforms into Jen talking about how she wants to get her nipples pierced. </p><p> </p><p>But she noticed the shift in Rio, her hand no longer on her thigh, focused back on peeling the tangerine, something reserved and quiet that only Agatha could see. </p><p> </p><p>Rio places the peeled pieces on a napkin, sliding it towards Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches for a piece with one hand, eating it slowly, her other hand latching at Rio’s wrist, rubbing against her veins, trying to press in some comfort, wishing she could pick Rio’s brain right this second for the reason she was retreating from the conversation. </p><p> </p><p>Her brain couldn’t help but jump to the conclusion that Rio was mad at her for not telling her about Ralph before. Rio had been telling Agatha about all the boys she’d kissed at camp for years, even if Agatha didn’t want the details, and Agatha was withholding milestones like first kisses. </p><p> </p><p>She could understand the frustration, she didn’t know how to explain her way out of it, especially now, in a full cafeteria, in the midst of the way Rio made her feel. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Mark 11:25- And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry” Agatha offers unprompted. </p><p> </p><p>They’re running the track for PE, ‘running’ being a loose term, more like a spirited walk. It’s still too cold for it, but what is Catholic school if not torture. </p><p> </p><p>They’ve swapped out their uniforms for school issued sweatpants that are unflattering and baggy, St Elizabeth High School crest on the hip, and a crew neck that reads “St. Elizabeth Cranes”, a mascot meant to reflect their spiritual enlightenment, a bird Agatha thought of as frail and unimposing, not fit to scare off their opponents in varsity basketball games. </p><p> </p><p>Still, she hated that her first thought was that it was a look Rio made work. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her, unsure of what she’s apologizing for. Agatha doesn’t make her ask.</p><p> </p><p>”For not telling you about Ralph”</p><p> </p><p>”it’s okay, Agatha,” Rio smiles at her, and Agatha can tell she means it, that perhaps Agatha had read her wrong, that maybe something else had her quiet. </p><p> </p><p>“What’s wrong?” Agatha asks, unable to swallow down the question as they’ve continued their pace for several moments of silence, the off vibe from Rio not going away. </p><p> </p><p>There’s other girls around, the track not exactly empty, but no one paying them any specific attention, enough privacy that Rio could speak freely. </p><p> </p><p>Rio stops and Agatha follows, letting a few people pass them. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio gives her breath a second to settle back to normal, “It’s not that you didn’t tell me, I just…” </p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t finish her sentence, trying her best to find the words. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha waits, her mind trying to source out some explanation that makes sense. </p><p> </p><p>“I guess I thought you cared more about that stuff,” Rio shrugs, her hands tucked up into her sleeves looking sheepish and lanky. </p><p> </p><p>“About first kisses?” Agatha needs some clarification. </p><p> </p><p>“I know you don’t really talk about it, but I assumed it was because you had no experience with it, the way you talked about Ralph, it seemed like relationships don’t interest you” Rio tries to explain her perception.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brain is stalling, needing Rio to break it down like she’s 5, because what the fuck is she talking about?</p><p> </p><p>Rio speaks again, trying to explain better when she sees the cogs turning so harshly in Agatha’s mind. </p><p> </p><p>“If you’re asexual, I support you, obviously, I guess it’s just taking me a second to process,” Rio tries to clarify. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha fucking hates Rio. Because that assumption was several leaps from the truth, when her apathy towards Ralph could be specific to him being a bad kisser (or I don’t know, maybe the fact that Agatha is a raging homosexual in love with her dumbass best friend).</p><p> </p><p>Agatha fucking loves Rio. Because of course, she’d find a way to be supportive of her, shift her personal perception of what she assumed of Agatha, when Agatha had not in any shape or form said anything about being asexual.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m not asexual!” Agatha presses out, somewhat defensive, needing to set the record straight. She indeed, wanted to do many not straight, very sexual things with Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, there’s nothing wro-“</p><p> </p><p>”Rio,” Agatha grabs her shoulders, shaking the dumb out of her, “I’m not repressed”</p><p> </p><p>Okay, she’s very repressed, but not in regard to oppressing this perceived asexuality in her.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m not asexual, I just didn’t like Ralph.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, she sees the truth settle in Rio’s face, her brain finally catching up to erase the assumption she made, catching up to the embarrassment of the fact that they’d really just had that conversation. </p><p> </p><p>Sister Margaret blows the whistle at them from the other side of the lanes, the sound breaking them out of their staring contest. </p><p> </p><p>“Get movin’ girls,” Sister Margaret chirps, springing them back into motion. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles, always brought to laughter at the way the nun’s habit was strategically altered to allow more freedom of movement, but still maintain modesty, a look that had earned her nicknames like “gym nun” and “sister recreation”.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is jogging in stride with her after a moment, their footfalls tapping in sync. </p><p> </p><p>“Sometimes I wonder what it’s like inside that brain of yours,” Agatha teases, reflecting on the strange conversation Rio had stirred up from an single sentence from Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles, taking it as a compliment somehow.</p><p> </p><p>”it’s a scary place,” Rio counters like a true warning for Agatha to never enter if ever given the chance. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p>Song of Solomon 8:6- Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, for love is strong as death, jealousy is fierce as the grave. It flashes of fire, the very flame of the lord. </p><p> </p><p>“You sure she’s not gonna be home?” Rio asks, her hands occupied by her phone.</p><p> </p><p>They’re in the library for their free period, sat in a secluded corner , a small table that seats 4, but they’re the only two occupying it, sitting across from each other.</p><p> </p><p>”Yes,” Agatha breaths, sometimes wishing Rio wasn’t so protective, would let her rebel and deal with the cuts and bruises later, “they’ve got some staff meeting til 8 and she usually gets dinner with a few nuns after”.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t answer immediately, staring at her phone, typing furiously, chuckling at whatever is on her phone. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” Rio voices after a moment. Agatha is getting tired of the ‘S’ word. “It’s Billy.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy.</p><p> </p><p>A boy. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s friend who Agatha has never met.</p><p> </p><p>Rio met Billy volunteering at the animal shelter. They’d become fast friends, texting each other mostly, but hanging out in person sometimes too.</p><p> </p><p>It doesn’t bother Agatha, not usually. </p><p> </p><p>She has no right to stake a claim on Rio, and the kid seems to be a good friend. </p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t know much, just that he seems to make Rio laugh, that they compete over who can get the most animals adopted in a shift, and that Billy gifted Rio a Lego set for Christmas. </p><p> </p><p>The fact that Agatha saw Rio everyday at school and Billy only got to see her volunteering every other weekend was helpful knowledge. </p><p> </p><p>But she can’t deny the cold trickle of jealousy now, the lurch in her stomach. This intrusive desire to lunge across the table, pull Rio up by the lapel and kiss her. </p><p> </p><p>“He wants to know if we wanna get food after school.”</p><p> </p><p>“We?” Agatha tries not to sound confused, thinking Rio had purposely not introduced them up to this point, “He knows about me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Duh,” Rio can’t help the flight of the word, “why wouldn’t he? He keeps asking to meet you.”</p><p> </p><p>That kind of throws Agatha, not because she’s opposed, if anything she wants to meet him too, confirm her image of a cocky meathead who’s somehow ripped Rio’s heart from her weak grasp (God, she needs to lift some weights, Rio can not win every wrestling match!).</p><p> </p><p>But the fact that Billy wants to meet her only files him in her brain as something even worse, like he’s excited to walk around with Rio and Agatha on his arm like Agatha would ever let that happen. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, where does he want to go?”</p><p>—-</p><p>The diner isn’t the worst place Billy could have chosen. Agatha had only ever been here with Rio and her parents on the nights Agatha and Rio ended up studying at the kitchen table too late and no one felt like cooking dinner. </p><p> </p><p>It’s some of the only times Agatha felt like she had a family, tucked in a booth with Rio, her mother, her father, the camaraderie of it that never echoed on the nights she was forced to have dinner with Evanora.  Of course Billy didn’t know that though, and she wasn’t letting his excellent taste in shitty diners alter her assumptions about him. </p><p> </p><p>”You nervous?” Rio asks from beside her in the booth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is pretending to look through the unnecessarily long menu, playing with the ends of her hair idly, quiet, trying not to pay attention to the way Rio keeps checking in on her, somehow sensing  Agatha’s apprehension. </p><p> </p><p>”I think you’re projecting,” Agatha answers without looking up. </p><p> </p><p>“Billy’s cool, you have nothing to worry about,” Rio tries to soothe her worries even if Agatha won’t admit to them. “Speak of the devil.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s as if Rio’s words summoned him, a lanky figure coming up to their booth before sliding into the side across from them. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” his smile is so easy. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha is such a dumbass. </p><p> </p><p>Billy looks at her so sweetly, extending his hand out to shake in introduction.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m Billy, Rio never shuts up about you.”</p><p> </p><p>”Dude!” Rio tries to defend herself, but Agatha’s still reeling at the sight of him.</p><p> </p><p>This is the kid Agatha thought Rio had a crush on. </p><p> </p><p>Billy, and his egregious amount of rings, the chipping black polish on his nails, his eyeliner, the feminine sweater, and yep, definitely lip gloss. </p><p> </p><p>Okay, so Billy definitely wasn’t looking at Rio the way she thought. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” she finally meets his handshake, “But you knew that” she smirks, that assertive charm seeping out easily. </p><p> </p><p>“I like her already,” he turns to Rio, seemingly offering his approval. </p><p> </p><p>They order their food, conversation flowing less awkwardly than Agatha had thought it would. Rio and Billy talk about dogs at the shelter, but Agatha doesn’t feel excluded, something circular and open about the way they switch off, Agatha doesn’t feel like she has to question her own voice. Maybe it’s the comfort she already feels around Rio bleeding into the fact that Rio seems so safe with Billy, there isn’t a shield with him, this quiet openness Agatha doesn’t always get from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>And she wants to be jealous of it, this extra layer she’s seeing of her friend in the presence of a boy she’s known less than a year, but it feels stable, easy, a feeling she’s been missing lately. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha let’s Rio and Billy pick at her fries. Rio keeps looking at her with this gentle curiosity, like she knew Agatha was enjoying herself but was afraid that pointing it out would ruin the moment.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is laughing at something Agatha said, the gap in her teeth showing, her eyes soft and at ease and it breaks something loose, this carefree moment better than she’d imagined. She wants Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Wants to hold her close, to kiss her, to feel every inch of her skin, to not be afraid to tell her about the pulsing butterflies, the winding ache of desire that runs through her, the magnetism, the red string of fate that keeps them so close. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha loves Rio and she’s tired of pretending she doesn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Billy sighs, they’re laughter dying down.</p><p> </p><p>”Why did it take us so long to do this?” He smiles, the quirk of his lips awkward, the expression suiting his features. </p><p> </p><p>“You should bring Eddie next time,” Rio comments, sipping on Agatha’s water after she’d finished her own. </p><p> </p><p>“Eddie?” Agatha asks, pulling her glass out of Rio’s grip, not willing to sacrifice her own hydration after the heavy sodium intake. </p><p> </p><p>“Billy’s boyfriend,” Rio clarifies, further solidifying just how little Agatha had to worry about Billy. </p><p> </p><p>“He’s awesome,” Billy’s eyes light up as he talks about him, “ That’s a great idea actually. He’s been wanting to make more queer friends”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows what he’s insinuating, but she’s not sure how he got to that conclusion. She guesses that whatever facial expression makes her confusion clear. </p><p> </p><p>At the same time, Agatha sees the way Rio flinches out of the corner of her eye.</p><p> </p><p>Billy wasn’t just assuming Agatha was queer.</p><p> </p><p>He was talking about Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“Billy…” Rio tries to start at something, correct him, warn him, Agatha isn’t sure. </p><p> </p><p>Her brain isn’t fully following, because Rio…Rio’s gay…? It feels like the confirmation she’s been waiting for, something she’d hoped so intensely for that she can’t compute it as reality. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” Billy recenters himself clearing his throat, “I didn’t mean to assume Agatha, I just thought because Rio is-“</p><p> </p><p>”Billy,” Rio cuts him off this time, “She doesn’t know…” there’s something broken in Rio’s voice, this perilous resignation, an iceberg waiting to melt.</p><p> </p><p>”Oh, shit” Billy is shaking his head, astonished by his own mistake, just about outing Rio without even realizing it, “Fuck, I didn’t mean to-“</p><p> </p><p>Billy’s words are cut off by Rio once more, but not by her words. Rio pushes out of the booth, focused on escaping the moment she walks away. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha isn’t sure when her brain latches back onto the present, a spiraling of fear tracking back towards the chance that Rio could actually have feelings for her, or at least had the capacity to. She finds Billy’s eyes, wide, scared, his brown eyes following Rio’s retreating form, but his body paralyzed to the seat. </p><p> </p><p>She’s not thinking about anything in that moment, the pressure of it clearing out, the nature of her body following after Rio without processing it. Agatha pushes herself out of the booth too, chasing behind Rio’s fast moving silhouette into the women’s restroom, unsure of how her feet have carried her there, only focused on making sure Rio is okay, her mind only settling back in when she lays eyes on her again. </p><p> </p><p>Rio is at the running sink, hunched slightly, wetting her face, rubbing at her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha recognizes the flustered redness in her cheeks, the stiff movements, the goosebumps on her arms. Agatha can’t help the way her eyes bore into her, collect every piece of her and keep it safe in her memory.</p><p> </p><p>”You didn’t have to follow me,” Rio doesn’t look at her, the stale tone detached. </p><p> </p><p>It makes Agatha ache. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha doesn’t know what to say, the crippling shame that Rio knew how to comfort her like it was second nature, and Agatha couldn’t string a single sentence together. </p><p> </p><p>“Just give me a minute and then I’ll take you home.”</p><p> </p><p>There was no anger in the words, simply directing the events, leaving no room for Agatha to express her grievances, no place for Agatha to tell Rio that she was living a life of sin, to accuse her of keeping this from her, to erase the years of friendship now tainted by the people Rio happened to love.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t handle how stuck she feels, can’t let it end like this. A different version of her would push herself forward, march into Rio’s space and press her into the bathroom wall, grab her face between her hands and kiss her, press her into a stall, yank at her blazer, kiss her until there were no more questions, show her that there was no need for this wall between them, fight for Rio to truly feel all the stupid feelings Agatha had felt for the past four years. </p><p> </p><p>But, she doesn’t. She can’t. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you done?” Agatha asks instead, her voice cracking, fed up with feeling like they weren’t on the same page. She hated that Rio could even question their friendship for a second, that Rio could think anything would make Agatha walk away from her. </p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>”Are you done being ridiculous?” Agatha tries again, stepping closer. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio doesn’t know what to say. </p><p> </p><p>“You being into girls…” Agatha stops herself for half a breath, still jarred by the reality of her own words, this has to be the way she frames it for now, not brave enough to reveal the whole truth, that Agatha wants nothing more than to confess, but the weight of it still feels too crushing, this has to be enough for now, “doesn’t change that you’re my best friend,” she sniffles suddenly realizing the tears falling from her eyes, “and I’m kind of offended that you’d think it does.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio is looking at her like she is the antidote, the silver lining, the only truth she knows.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t know how to handle it. </p><p> </p><p>“So, are you done being fucking stupid?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio knows what she means, quieting all the dangerous whispers of doubt, brushing away the fear that Agatha would be upset, would push her away, would hate her for this. Rio knows it's Agatha’s way of saying she loves her, that nothing could break their bond. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio’s voice creaks, looking sheepish, but letting the solid relief hit her all the same. </p><p> </p><p>She reaches for some of the cheap brown paper towels, stepping towards Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“Stop crying, idiot,” Rio chuckles, trying to nudge them back into practiced territory, “You’re ruining your makeup”, she adds, dabbing at Agatha’s face delicately. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushes down Rio’s arms, pulling her into a harsh embrace, wanting to be as close as possible, breathing in everything she could. </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles into her shoulder, sighing at the comfort of Agatha in her arms.</p><p> </p><p>”We should probably make sure Billy isn’t having a heart attack,” Rio whispers into her after a moment. </p><p> </p><p>“One more minute”</p><p> </p>

<p>Psalm 27:14- Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart; Wait, I say, on the Lord.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hair is down.</p><p> </p><p>It’s obviously not the first time she’s worn it out like this to school, the sure waves of it coming over her shoulders, but everything feels different now. </p><p> </p><p>Now that Agatha knew Rio was interested in women, everything had a new lens. </p><p> </p><p>Like Agatha had permission to look, her stares not something she needed to be ashamed of, like Rio had rolled out the welcome mat just for Agatha to ogle at her.</p><p> </p><p>And it’s not like Agatha didn’t love every other way Rio would wear her hair, the go-to bun a standard crowd pleaser, Agatha loved the way it exposed Rio’s neck, the flex of her throat, the soft skin on display like a vacant wall begging to be covered in graffiti. </p><p> </p><p>But there was something undeniably feminine at the way her hair framed her face, fell in thick curtains, played along her collar bones over her uniform. And it was making Agatha swoon every time she was near her. </p><p> </p><p>As infuriating as anatomy class was, Agatha was a lot more willing to push through her disgust at frog dissections if it meant she got to watch Rio engaged in something she found genuinely interesting.</p><p> </p><p>Rio loved science, mostly the plant stuff, chlorophyll and photosynthesis and all that crap. But she also didn’t discriminate her sciences, still invested in learning all she could whether it be prehistoric theory, human biology, or even physics for fucks sake. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha could only get behind it for the sake of seeing Rio in her element, some of the only classes Rio wasn’t doodling for 45 minutes straight, giving her full attention to the lesson.</p><p> </p><p>Until of course Sister Eunice spiraled out of questions about evolution and tracked back into the “God is our lone creator” bull shit. </p><p> </p><p>Still, Agatha wouldn’t be surprised if Rio was spending her free time reading their science textbooks front to back. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha could allow Rio’s attention to be somewhere other than her without being jealous if it was given to nerd shit. Rio had ranted to her on several occasions about how science only consisted of theories and how she couldn’t fathom that in some sense most of them couldn’t be absolutely proven given their specific limited perception and Agatha would have told anyone other than Rio to “please shut the fuck up”.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe it wasn’t just the hair, or the rapt attention making her go all heart eyes for Rio (okay, more so than usual), maybe it was this shift of sorts, this feeling like Rio was different too now, more open, more clear.</p><p> </p><p>”Do your parents know?” Agatha asks on the ride back after the diner.</p><p> </p><p>Only secure in Rio’s passenger seat after Billy apologized to Rio so hard Agatha thought he might pass out, followed by Rio rubbing his shoulder and profusely telling him they were cool. </p><p> </p><p>“No,” Rio peaks at her for a moment, keeping her attention mostly on the road, “I don’t think they’d be mad, just surprised maybe,” she shrugs. </p><p> </p><p>“Did you think I’d be mad?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a moment to mull it over. </p><p> </p><p>“Maybe not mad, just different.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated that fear, but knew it well, this unending battle that changing anything between them would shatter her, losing this Rio would kill her. </p><p> </p><p>And now almost a week later, it had been different, maybe not in any of the ways Rio feared, but there was a change in undercurrent, the resounding energy an echo of a taste Agatha had never experienced before. </p><p> </p><p>It felt like a cliff, or maybe a mountain, a precipice of deciding whether to keep climbing or fall. Maybe it was just Rio feeling like she didn’t have to hide herself anymore, that quiet shame in touching Agatha without her knowing the truth. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s bruises were healing, the faint reminders of hazy discolored skin, the cut on her eyebrow sealed and fading. And usually this tide of healing pressed in new anxiety, the longer they’d go without an outburst from Evanora the more she put her guard up, prepared her mind for another release of trauma.</p><p> </p><p>But this time, there was something settling against her differently, maybe it was hope, maybe it was this delusional tug toward the future, a place in her mind where she could see tomorrow and the edges of it weren’t dark. </p><p> </p><p>Rio and Agatha were always lab partners and now was no different. Rio in blue latex clothes, chunky protective goggles, holding a scalpel…</p><p> </p><p>Okay, so what if Agatha was turned on by that image. </p><p> </p><p>But, today they weren’t doing any dissections, no gloves, or goggles, or scalpels. </p><p> </p><p>Instead, they were measuring each other’s heart rates, an experiment to understand the cardiovascular system that Agatha thought was a big fucking waste of time. Obviously, the heart beats faster after physical activity. </p><p> </p><p>And how does anyone expect her resting heart rate to be normal when Rio’s got two fingers up to the pulse point on the side of her neck tucked beneath her jaw, her brown eyes portraying something conflicted. Rio doesn’t look at her, but at the stopwatch, waiting for a minute to pass as she counts the amount of times Agatha’s artery bounces against her fingers. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you nervous?” Rio smirks at her as she records Agatha’s higher than average resting heart rate. </p><p> </p><p>“I never let my guard down around Sister Eunice,” Agatha deflects, happy to get the laugh out of Rio, helping her to steer away from the truth. </p><p> </p><p>That Rio makes her feel crazy, her heart pounding in her ears at their proximity, her blush curling up her neck. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio slinks back toward their handout after coming out of her laughter, “now do 20 jumping jacks”</p><p> </p><p>”Why am I the one who has to do the jumping jacks?” Agatha huffs, half rhetorical, the way Rio naturally took the lead on all of their labs. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m the scientist, you’re my guinea pig,” Rio supplies an answer swiftly, reaching forward to boop Agatha on the nose.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grimaces, “I’d rather be a rabbit”</p><p> </p><p>”Lucky for you,” Rio offers without a misstep, never deterred by Agatha’s quips, “I’m also a magician,” Rio feigns the standard magic trick of pulling a coin from Agatha’s ear with her pencil as her prop of choice. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha just looks at her, unimpressed, her heart singing at how adorably goofy Rio is, how her flow of lighthearted comments met Agatha’s deadpan detached sense of humor so well.</p><p> </p><p>”Get it, cause rabbits. Magician hats,” Rio tries to explain, a bit she’d play into often like Agatha simply didn’t understand the joke, because in no way could the lack of reaction stem from Rio not being funny. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m gonna do the jumping jacks now,” Agatha cracks her a smile, pushing them out of their back and forth for the time being. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>“You seem different,” Jen says offhandedly as they walk from lunch to their next class, pre-calculus, one of the only classes Rio doesn’t have with her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t respond with a verbal answer, turns to look at Jen with a raised eyebrow, wondering when the fuck they crossed the boundary of commenting on each other’s perceived changes.</p><p> </p><p>”Good different,” Jen clarifies.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe if Jennifer Kale were anybody else, she’d think good of her commentary, but Agatha knew better, knew Jen was teetering close to unknown territory on purpose, doing her best to get a reaction without completely stepping over lines. </p><p> </p><p>“How so?” Agatha asks, too curious to stop herself, even if she wasn’t sure about trusting her classmate’s opinions in general. </p><p> </p><p>“You seem…brighter maybe, like you’re actually excited for something,” Jennifer scoffs to herself, “I've never seen you excited.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh” Agatha scowls, taking in the words, letting them bounce around her head.</p><p> </p><p>Because how had Jennifer noticed the shift, this imperceptible movement that even Agatha couldn’t fully pin down. This perhaps tangible difference in the way she floated through existence, now some stroke of color in the sea of drab. </p><p> </p><p>She decidedly was not thinking about it anymore, caught in the purgatory of trying to assign meaning to every interaction with Rio, bit never growing the back bone to actually ask her about it. </p><p> </p><p>And Jen’s revelation didn’t change that, Jen only spoke of a change in Agatha. Not Rio. And in another timeline, Agatha would simply say something crude back, walk faster through the hall to get away from Jen, push away the thought that there might be any shred of hope for her. </p><p> </p><p>More evidence that something had changed in her. It felt embarrassing to be perceived in that way, all because Rio came out to her, a piece of information that changed exactly nothing about their friendship. Just because Rio liked girls, didn’t mean she liked Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>The word ‘like’ felt empty and childish, when all of Agatha’s thoughts were consumed with Rio for the better part of their friendship, when Agatha had dreamt up any possible scenario of confessions over and over, and still bit her tongue, swallowed down any hope of it and existed in the numb of reality. </p><p> </p><p>It was paralyzing, she felt herself shrinking at the complicated emotion, shame, embarrassment that this new information had turned her into a giddy love struck weirdo, at least in her head, but enough that it had inspired Jennifer Kale to say something about it. </p><p> </p><p>If Jen saw it, did that mean Rio felt it too? </p><p> </p><p>Maybe it was time to direct her anger at Rio. For all the times Agatha felt her heart about to burst with longing, for all the time they’d spent together, Rio had never confessed, had never said anything in the realm of admitting romantic feelings, and maybe the only explanation for that was that Rio didn't have any for Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t mean to send you into a mental crisis,” Jen pipes up again when Agatha hasn’t said anything else, noticing the way Agatha seemed to shut down slightly, curl in on herself.</p><p> </p><p>”Why are you being so nice to me?” And perhaps it wasn’t exactly nice, but considerate, not totally coated in the usual mocking or light-hearted insults, definitely nice by Agatha Harkness and Jennifer Kale standards. </p><p> </p><p>Jen looks at her like she’s crazy, wondering where Agatha’s opinions of her sat on the scale of friends to enemies. </p><p> </p><p>“Cause were friends”</p><p> </p><p>”Yeah,” Agatha doesn’t know what to do with that, didn’t know Jennifer categorized them as such, didn’t know why she had put up her walls high enough to miss that, to push out any truths about people that had her back, maybe she was realizing now, “Friends”</p><p> </p><p>”You okay?” Jen asks as they turn into their pre-calculus class room, genuine concern there. Had it been there before? Had Agatha missed it?</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah”</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p>Agatha doesn’t usually subscribe to the Friday restlessness. The phenomenon of excitement for the impending weekend, trouble concentrating in class, waiting impatiently for the bell to ring. </p><p> </p><p>It means going home to Evanora. It means two days of studying, doom scrolling on tiktok, rotting in her bed with permission to go nowhere and do nothing. Sunday morning church is mandatory, perhaps a breath away from the static of her walls is better than nothing. It always felt like some well manicured trap, all the people her age rushing home to escape the torment of another mundane school week, a wave she let herself be swayed in from time to time. But she couldn’t make plans. </p><p> </p><p>There had been times where Evanora wasn’t home on a Saturday, times where she took the chance to sneak out the side door where there was no doorbell camera, pray to God that she made it home before her mother.</p><p> </p><p>But now didn’t feel like a great time to test her luck, a count going in her head of how long she could go without a slap across the face. It swung like a pendulum sometimes, her urge to rebel swinging all the way back into this realm of only fear, where stepping out of line just didn’t feel worth it. </p><p> </p><p>She’s in the school library after school, an Evanora approved activity, even if 90% of the student body has already left the building giving in to the pull to get out of this place after a long week. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha is studying (waiting for Rio to get out of her Spanish Club meeting), tucked in a back corner chair, hidden behind bookshelves, a fleeting thought that a janitor could easily miss her back there, shut the lights, lock the door. The idea of being stuck in the library all weekend doesn’t exactly feel like the worst possible outcome. </p><p> </p><p>“Do I still have to whisper if we're the only two people in here?” Rio’s voice scares Agatha out of her thoughts as she strolls up to her creepily silent. </p><p> </p><p>“You scared the fuck out of me,” Agatha glares, her hand coming up to her chest, not hiding the rush of it from Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks regal, her dark hair falling so elegantly, still looking freshly styled after a full day of school, she’s wearing eyeliner that highlights the darkness of her eyes, her lips kissed with tinted chapstick. Agatha hates that as many times as she sees Rio in their school uniform, it still does things to her, the fitted blazer, the skirt. She felt like an old perv raking her eyes over her best friend, but Rio didn’t question it, never questioned it.</p><p> </p><p>“Functions got you that on edge?” Rio jokes referencing the Math textbook sitting on the little table next to Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“No, just my mother as usual,” Agatha complains shortly as she starts to pack up her books, not intending to start a whole conversation over it before she remembers-</p><p> </p><p>“I forgot to tell you…” Agatha’s lips are moving before she fully consents to it, before she knows which way she wants to explain. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her curious, waiting patiently. </p><p> </p><p>“Evanora doesn’t want me hanging out with you,” Agatha tries to push through it, give Rio little time to wonder when and why this came up with Agatha’s mother, skipping over any chances for Rio to blame herself for the fading bruises from the last attack, “So, we can’t be too obvious at church.”</p><p> </p><p>”I can just sit with my parents if you want,” Rio offers as an immediate solution, breaking the way they’d always sat together during service, Evanora always front row, Rio’s parents casually somewhere in the middle section, Agatha and Rio tucked in any pew with space. </p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha refuses quickly, looking up at Rio after zipping closed her backpack, she can’t place the emotion in brown irises, this shaky uncertainty swirling in the unconditional care, “We’ll figure it out, but I’m still sitting with you. Lord knows the last time I made it through mass without you singing off key next to me.”</p><p> </p><p>”I’m a natural performer and you know it,” Rio feigns offense, knowing full well the church hymns were not made for the singer to sound good. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stands finally, tossing her bag over her shoulder, coming into Rio’s personal space maybe too eagerly. She’s squinting at her, a silent challenge. </p><p> </p><p>Rio just stares waiting for Agatha to give up on whatever fake beef she’s conjured up now, knowing that Agatha could never even stay fake mad at her for long. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes shift and soften, settling just below her left eye, Rio’s hand comes up without hesitation, her fingers sliding over the skin there, soft but purposeful, only a second or two it still takes Agatha’s breath away. </p><p> </p><p>“Eyelash” Rio explains, the single eyelash resting on the tip of her pointer finger.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is looking at Rio like a knight in shining armor and she is the damsel in distress, like Rio had just broken her out of her high tower.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio has to do that stupid smirk, the one that makes her eyes squint slightly, the one that makes Agatha’s knees weak, like she sees the way Agatha is floored by her mere existence and can only toy with the fraying evidence, never coming close to changing their fate. </p><p> </p><p>“Make a wish,” Rio instructs like it’s sacred, pulled out of her prayer to God to be still in this moment, offer up her hand for Agatha to blow away the eyelash, search for answers from whatever cosmic energies are listening.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha holds the eye contact as she exhales, the offending eyelash falling away from Rio’s fingertip. Caught up in the tender darkness of Rio’s eyes, close enough to feel her warmth, captured by the softness of the moment, she forgets to ask the universe for something.</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p>John 14:3- And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora is already sitting in the first row, already kneeling before mass begins, her hands tightly wound in prayer, her eyes closed.</p><p> </p><p>In another life, the sight of it would be grounding, her mother called so securely to something bigger than herself, a path to follow, a belief system that as a child made Agatha feel less alone.</p><p> </p><p>Now, it only felt incongruent. An image that didn’t match up with the truth of her world. Her mother, dedicated to a God who loves all his people, the same woman that had raised her hand to her for as long as she could remember.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha still remembers when she realized it wasn’t normal, that the reprimands other children got for misbehaving were not the same, punished to a new degree where marks were always left behind, when she used it as a means of control, held Agatha to an unattainable standard.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t been an altar server for quite a while now, giving way to younger children when she was about 15. But she still knew them well, tried to serve as something of a mentor, a resource if any of them needed someone to speak to, perhaps things they didn’t think appropriate to tell the adults of the church.</p><p> </p><p>It served as a good excuse to hang back, explore into the church basement to find the 3 boys and 2 girls that would assist Father Buchanan during the service. There is always a touch of nostalgia in watching them prepare, chatting idly among them, checking in. Agatha liked to believe a lot had changed in the last 2 years or so, but for the most part she still felt so stuck, entangled in this battle of understanding.</p><p> </p><p>Faith had always felt untouchable, a pattern of knots that she could never fully untether herself from. It felt like an undoing, a world where she didn’t exist without her belief in God.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe it was the only thing keeping her alive for a long time, a chance for salvation, a promise that as much as her mother hated her, Jesus loved her. The root of it so sunken into her past, most days she didn’t know how to walk into a future without it. Even if the truth of it didn’t serve her anymore, even if getting older had only exposed her to the darkness, the shame, the greed that lurked just behind the beaded veil. </p><p> </p><p>She makes her way back into the lobby, standing to the side as families pass through, smiling as best she can at faces she’s come across every Sunday for years, some greeting her with ‘hello’s and warm hugs. And perhaps it was this that kept her from completely severing ties, this feeling of community, no matter how shallow in some instances, the sharing in it, the support she never had the chance to experience elsewhere. Evanora had made church home for better or worse. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha spots Mrs. Vidal like Moses parting the Red Sea, the gentle confidence curling through the crowd like a wave. Agatha had always admired her assuredness, never bowing to the pressure to stew in the shame of sin, an aura that many in the church saw as disrespectful. Agatha thought it was beautiful, the way Rio’s mother was 100% herself in every room, could see the way Rio had taken after her, a refusal to be made to feel less than.</p><p> </p><p>Mrs. Vidal pulls Agatha into a hug like it’s second nature, holding tight for maybe a second more than usual, clutching onto Agatha’s shoulders to look at her fully, as if to make sure she was truly okay.</p><p> </p><p>”I haven’t seen you in forever, mija,” the words tumble out gracefully in lieu of asking any uncomfortable questions, never pushing Agatha to share anything she didn’t want to, “We’ve missed you.”</p><p> </p><p>This unconditional warmth always makes Agatha want to cry, the ease with which Rio’s parents extended their care to Agatha without hesitation, the way her own mother had never come close to this level of nurturing. It made her feel pathetic, like an ounce of regard for her well being was enough to overwhelm her. </p><p> </p><p>“I miss you too,” Agatha tries to hold back the emotion of it, the way she didn’t just love the Vidals because they were Rio’s family, but because she actually enjoyed them as people, took the time to really know them the same way they had made an effort to really know Agatha, “I’ll try to come over for dinner this week,” she offers, knowing how much Rio’s mother loved to cook for the people she loved. </p><p> </p><p>Rio and her father stroll in a few moments later, probably lolly-gagging in the parking lot. </p><p> </p><p>Rio is in a yellow dress, her hips and torso framed elegantly, but still modest enough for church, the shape of it doing more to Agatha than any amount of showing skin. It makes her feel slightly underdressed, her brown dress pants, white shirt, and floral cardigan a few degrees simpler. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s father greets her, a tight hug, a kiss to the side of her head, something gentle and paternal. </p><p> </p><p>“Muy bonita,” he sing-songs all smiles, turning Agatha by the hand as if spinning her in a romantic dance. In all the places Mrs. Vidal is confident and reassuring, Mr. Vidal is a jovial goofball, another clear side to Rio. Agatha can’t help the way it makes her smile, the way he can compliment her without it feeling like something she has to hide from.</p><p> </p><p>”Papa,” Rio half-admonishes him, a playful warning that he was always being extra, especially if it meant he’d get the added consequence of annoying Rio.</p><p> </p><p>”She needs to know she’s gorgeous, chispita” Is his grand explanation, earning a laugh from Agatha, and an eye roll from Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“Alright, mi corazón,” Mrs. Vidal steps in to save them, although clearly amused as well, “we should head in, before we're the last ones.” She directs, her hand on her husband's shoulder, pushing him toward the door to enter the main room of the church. </p><p> </p><p>“We’ll be in a second,” Rio catches Agatha’s wrist, holding her back from following them inside, offering her parents a smile.</p><p> </p><p>They both nod, not questioning it, trusting Rio without question. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>They shouldn’t have trusted Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Because they hadn’t followed in behind them a moment later. Or ever. </p><p> </p><p>Rio, instead, convincing Agatha to ditch Mass, take the short walk around the building to the old playground.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s on the rusted swing set, the chain creaking against the bar with every swing.</p><p> </p><p>“I think you’re too big for that,” Agatha comments, standing to the side, admiring the way her dark hair, the skirt of her dress fluttered against the wind, noting the way Rio barely fit in the seat of it, her knees bent harshly at how close to the ground it was, these swings definitely intended for someone much smaller. </p><p> </p><p>“Hush, I’m living the last days of my youth,” Rio commands, a facade of annoyance that Agatha can only smile at as Rio doubles down on her attempt to make it off the ground. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha steps closer, grabbing one side of the chain in her hand, effectively stopping any chance of Rio gaining any momentum, looking down at her now.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is blinking up at her, her eyelashes casting delicate shadows in the sunshine, Agatha hovering close enough to see the smooth of Rio’s skin, the wrinkles in her lips. </p><p> </p><p>“We’re not even old yet.”</p><p> </p><p>”But we will be soon.” Rio says adamantly, feeling the pressure of impending change, the ripple of feeling like every little thing has world-altering consequences.</p><p> </p><p>”Are you afraid of getting older?” Agatha asks, pressing something serious between them, Rio still looking up at her, the intricate details of her irises more prominent like this. </p><p> </p><p>“I think I’m just scared of everything changing,” Rio voices, honest, open.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, Rio’s eyes tracking the changes in her face, the delicate smile, the way her blue eyes crinkle slightly. </p><p> </p><p>“I think I’m scared of everything staying the same”</p><p> </p><p>”Mmm,” is Rio’s response at first, a short sound of agreement, understanding where Agatha is coming from, “Maybe reality is somewhere in the middle, some things change, some things don’t, and we won’t have to be scared.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods looking down for a moment, not knowing where to steer them next, the air coated in vulnerability.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s thumb traces the edge of Agatha’s front pocket, the delicate touch almost tickling her, something electric in the way one of Rio’s hands could set her on fire without intention. Agatha pushes through the chill of it, needs to press forward. </p><p> </p><p>“What if,” she starts, trying to find the right way to frame it, “What if the wrong things change? What if the things I want to change stay the same?”</p><p> </p><p>”That’s where the fear comes in,” Rio has moved into stroking against her hip, keeping her close with the soft ministrations, the curl of her thumb pressing into Agatha’s hip bone, something calm, something possessive, “We can’t predict the future.”</p><p> </p><p>There’s something solemn in Rio’s voice, this reservation that perhaps she’d invest time and money into a Time Machine if it meant knowing if tomorrow is worth looking forward to. Maybe its the unpredictable, the unknown, the one thing that’s held Agatha back from facing her feelings for Rio for years. </p><p> </p><p>And here it was, starkly in her face that Rio was scared too, at least of what the world had to give them tomorrow, scared that change would be too much to handle, the loss of security, a place she would never willingly walk into. </p><p> </p><p>Believing in God used to make it all feel lighter, like the passage of time was dripping in His favor, the righteous path already laid out. Now it feels far away, something Agatha can’t grasp.</p><p> </p><p>It feels like a crack in her armor, a small edge to pick at, enough room for the light to get in, claw at the folded insides that have sat dormant for so long, aching for any touch of movement. Agatha takes a breath, wishing goodbye to the shame, to the version of herself too afraid to give voice to the crushing spiral of love, to the despair of holding onto all of it for years and never being able to set it free. </p><p> </p><p>It’s not a surging climax, the reality that progress is not made in leaps and bounds, Agatha is ready to take a first step, even if it results in falling. She’ll deal with the consequences if it means not everything stays exactly the same, pulling at frayed wires if only to feel the charge. </p><p> </p><p>“Is that why you’ve never kissed me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her, her eyes slightly widened, the shock of it taking a moment to settle, the movement of her hand stopping, the grip on Agatha’s hip suddenly more harsh. There’s a battle in Rio’s eyes and Agatha can’t look away. A slight tremble she can’t tell if it’s stemming from her or Rio, an itching in her heart at what to do. A part of her wounded to see Rio’s overwhelm, wanting to apologize, tell her to forget she even asked. A crueler, more selfish part happy to see Rio suffer the way she has, content to watch her swim her way back to the surface on her own. </p><p> </p>

<p>“Is that why you’ve never kissed me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her, her eyes slightly widened, the shock of it taking a moment to settle, the movement of her hand stopping, the grip on Agatha’s hip suddenly more harsh. There’s a battle in Rio’s eyes and Agatha can’t look away. A slight tremble she can’t tell if it’s stemming from her or Rio, an itching in her heart at what to do. A part of her wounded to see Rio’s overwhelm, wanting to apologize, tell her to forget she even asked. A crueler, more selfish part happy to see Rio suffer the way she has, content to watch her swim her way back to the surface on her own. </p><p> </p><p>Rio opens her mouth to speak, her breath a tilted sigh, but she closes her lips again trying to find the right words. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me to kiss you?” Are what she finally settles on after another moment of silence, the creases of each word shaky and unsure. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha is surprised they’re even still here, that she was able to ask such a question without instantly exploding, floored that Rio hadn’t run in the aftermath, that she was asking this of Agatha like it was a simple question, like she needed more answers. </p><p> </p><p>Of course, the question isn't exactly fair, leaving Agatha to press in puzzle pieces when she had asked first, done all the heavy lifting. She can feel the physical effects of it, the sweat on the back of her neck making her nauseous, the ache in her chest swirling like a flash of heart-burn.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warns, an attempt at refusal, “I’m asking you. Have you stopped… out of fear?” She’s never felt so in control, so confident to push forward through the difficulty, they had come this far, and Agatha was tired of waiting, tired of yearning for something just out of reach. </p><p> </p><p>Watching Rio struggle with it feels validating and sad at the same time, giving her reason to believe she hasn’t suffered alone in a pool of unreciprocated longing, but also a new realization that they had waited all this time for nothing. </p><p> </p><p>Still, she needed Rio to say it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio breaks the eye contact, removes her hand from Agatha’s hip, pushes herself off the swing to stand with a steadying breath, puts space between them.</p><p> </p><p>And the fear surges back, Agatha wishing she had super powers to keep Rio here until she speaks all her truth, glue her to the swing set if it means understanding each other. Agatha wipes her sweaty palms on the front of her pants, sucks in her own bottom lip, prepares herself for the impending fallout. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want to hurt you,” Rio faces her again, a couple feet of space between them, but the look in her eyes is vulnerable, honest. “I don’t want to ruin us.”</p><p> </p><p>It feels like a mirror, watching Rio fight herself, press away her desires in favor of saving them both. It’s painful, it’s liberating. She’s not sure if she’s listening to the devil or the angel on her shoulder, but she has to know the truth. </p><p> </p><p>”Answer the question, Rio.” Agatha is practically begging her now, her hands bunched into fists at her sides, pushing away the need to cry, trying her best to keep it together. </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t answer with words.</p><p> </p><p>Instead she steps forward, invading Agatha’s space.</p><p> </p><p>She forgets how to breathe, her mind snapping into this limited existence where she can only feel Rio, her brown eyes filled with tears and determination, her lips open slightly, the warmth of her breath on Agatha’s face, her palms come to rest against Agatha’s jaw line cradling her face. And they stay there for what feels like eternity, breathing the same air, waiting for the ground to open up and swallow them whole.</p><p> </p><p>It’s dizzying, a state of existence that had for so long felt like a dream, but now Rio was close enough to kiss, close enough to forget all the consequences.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s phone chimes.</p><p> </p><p>The specific tone assigned to a text message from the devil. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha says, breathless.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let’s go without another second passing. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha fishes her phone from her pocket in an instant, reading the message in record time. She tries her best to steady her breath in the aftermath of the proximity, tries to compartmentalize the soaring emotion she needed to push down. </p><p> </p><p>“Let’s go,” she demands quietly, not mean, but no room for questioning, “Evanora is asking where I am.”</p><p> </p><p>”Okay,” Rio follows behind her without another word.</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p>Acts 3:19- Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out. </p><p> </p><p>“A disgrace, Agatha. You are a disgrace to my name.” Evanora is only halfway through her tirade with no signs of stopping, certain by the way Mass isn’t even halfway over and her mother doesn’t have to worry about any eavesdropping on her ridicule for at least another 30 minutes. Her words are hushed yet crisp, her lips fitting over each syllable violently. </p><p> </p><p>They are outside of the church, just past the front steps as Evanora details her short-comings, how she had failed Evanora, how she had failed the Lord.</p><p> </p><p>”Leaving church during prayer is something I will not tolerate, do you hear me?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha is crying, unable to hold in the rush of tears, the whiplash of the last 10 minutes, the stress hitting her body without warning. The fact that Rio was hiding in a bush 10 feet away hearing this, only made it worse. </p><p> </p><p>“Stop your crying,” Evanora pushes her, just enough to throw her off balance, but not enough to leave any evidence, “You brought this on yourself.”  </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, mother.” Agatha wipes her tears, trying to seem as normal as possible, not wanting to continue this scene out in public, not wanting to give Rio any more ammunition.</p><p> </p><p>Evanora drags her by the arm back up the steps and into the church, her grip scorching into her bicep, the pain of it still secondary to the fog in her brain. She guides them into a row towards the back, sitting next to her in an effort to keep a close eye on her, stop her from escaping once more. Evanora snaps back into her pattern of praise, listening to the gospel intently, seemingly secure again in the fact that she knew where her daughter was, rightfully extending her relationship with God. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sees Rio come in a few minutes later, finding the pew a few rows ahead of them to sit with her parents, she’s relieved when Evanora doesn’t seem to notice. Rio’s jaw is set tight, her eyes downcast, a shift that only Agatha would notice. To everyone else Rio was still playing her role, the respectful daughter quietly making her way into her seat. Even here, Agatha knew the expectations were different for them.</p><p> </p><p>Evanora was extremely devout, her role as principal of a Catholic School didn’t leave much room for anything less. And of course, those implications fell on her daughter, to never step out of line, to strive for perfection, that anything less was not good enough.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s parents were already sort of viewed as outsiders. Agatha wasn’t blind to the racial undertones of it all, that even if both of Rio’s parents were citizens, even if they were lawful taxpayers, the world would always villainize them, blame them for things outside of their control. And even in a house of worship, where the main teaching was loving thy neighbor, was not casting judgement, the people in these pews held bias against the churchgoers that had darker skin tones, that spoke different languages. </p><p> </p><p>It felt horrifying to be envious of that in some ways, like the expectation bar for them was set a little lower, the desire to be perfect cemented a little less if she knew perfection was impossible in their eyes. </p><p> </p><p>It just felt like another reason to run from here, flee from the ugly that sang hymns and preached of love in an effort to hide the hatred, the bigotry. </p><p> </p><p>She tries to focus on her breathing, push the panic away, resolve herself to find the silver linings, that Agatha saw the text and came back, that Evanora didn’t come looking, that she hadn’t found her with Rio. </p><p> </p><p>The words of the priest bring her back in, the story of a woman from the Gospel of Mark, how she had bled for years, her belief in Jesus ultimately healing her from simply touching his robe. </p><p> </p><p>“Jesus said ‘Daughter, you are well because you dared to believe. Go in peace, and stay well.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had soaked herself in faith, pressed all of her mind into the hope that her belief in Him would be enough to break her from the wretched curse of her existence. And for a long time, it felt like an escape, a world she could breathe in, where everything would turn out okay if she prayed, if she was gracious, if she did as her mother told her. </p><p> </p><p>But now it all felt like a scam, a dream she’d woken up from. She found it admirable, the dedication of the people around her, the community it brought, the hope in the eyes of the children, a place of safety to come back to when the world felt uninhabitable. But it couldn’t be that for her anymore, couldn’t hold all the pain in these wooden walls anymore, not enough candles to be set ablaze to quiet the fire in her soul that raged to run. </p><p> </p><p>But she can’t run.</p><p> </p><p>Stuck to the cold surface of the pew, quietly imploding she holds back her tears, numbing herself to reality, pushing away the sound of the priest’s voice, forgetting how close her mother is, she focuses on the back of Rio’s head, contemplates a life that isn’t all consumed by fear, by repression, by all the things expected of her and none of her actual desires. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Matthew 11:28- Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood inside the bathroom stall, her forehead pressed into the wall, one hand steadying her there as she took deep breaths, needing a moment to hide herself away from everyone else, seal herself in the confines of the small space to keep her from the judgement of her mother even if it meant facing the claustrophobia.</p><p> </p><p>Mass had ended, Evanora probably speaking to as many people as she could as they made their way out of the church, wearing her usual fake smile and projecting joy in a way Agatha had never been on the receiving end of.</p><p> </p><p>”Agatha,” her name is called, the voice splitting yet cautious. </p><p> </p><p>Rio.</p><p> </p><p>The pounding in her head was too intense to find full clarity immediately, unsure if the voice was real or she’d imagined it. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, open the door,” Rio’s voice comes again, now just outside the stall door, the words much clearer now, still Agatha tilts her head to peek through the bottom opening of the stall, confirm it’s Rio’s feet planted on the other side before moving to unlock the door. </p><p> </p><p>The bathroom is in the church basement, not a common stop for the average church goer, most using the one adjacent to the lobby if at all. Coming here at the end of mass had been strategic, Agatha knowing that it would be rare for anyone else to be down here, but also knowing it was a place that Rio would probably go looking for her. </p><p> </p><p>The look in Rio’s eyes is a dark abyss, a fear Agatha has never seen planted there, the echo of what will one day be forehead wrinkles, the worry in the delicate creases of her innocent face. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t give her the time to say anything, can’t give Rio the opportunity to take in her shivering form, the way her eyes were surely red, the etch of fresh tears still falling. She launches forward towards her instead, needing to feel the comfort of Rio in her arms, the solidity of her pressed into her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t hesitate to hug her back, Agatha’s arms wrapping around her shoulders as Rio’s latch around her waist, the searing warmth like a fire pit, the flames licking close to her skin, the pain of the crash pressing out the discomfort, giving way to relief. Agatha sighs into her neck, unashamed of the tears that continue to fall, the ragged breaths pressed against Rio’s pulse. She smells like sea salt and cedar, a coarse coating of escape, a masculine edge to the lotions Rio had always chosen, a sense of something familiar and secure. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio tries, an attempt at convincing them both, “You’re safe,” it feels shaky and from a place of frustration and pain, but Agatha soaks it in, needing the words even if they are hushed and soggy. </p><p> </p><p>They stay wrapped in each other for a harsh moment, crushing bones together, heart pressed to heart. Agatha pulls away first, the hold Rio has on her feeling steady and unyielding, a position Rio would stay in for as long as Agatha needed. </p><p> </p><p>Rio only looks her in the eye for a moment, perhaps shaken by the broken expression Agatha wears, her face red and blotchy from her own tremendous emotions, not the evidence of her mother’s physical violence for once, just the emotional effects of her callous rage. There’s something fiercely tangled there, a choice Agatha is getting closer to making. </p><p> </p><p>Not yet. </p><p> </p><p>Rio turns around briefly, ripping off a piece of scratchy brown paper towel to hand Agatha. She takes the offensive material, wiping it under her nose, knowing the snot was probably the worst part of the liquid leaking from her face, the tears would dry without much interference. </p><p> </p><p>Still, Rio turns around again, grabbing more paper towel, before putting herself to work, seemingly changing her mind from whatever had stopped her from doing so originally.</p><p> </p><p>Rio brushes any stray hairs clung to Agatha’s cheeks, strokes the tears away gently, undeterred by the girl in front of her actively blowing her nose. Rio’s expression is more delicate now, her features settling slightly, focused on clearing Agatha’s face, seemingly calmed by Agatha’s presence, the way they’d done this before, had been this close in the name of covering bruises and cuts. </p><p> </p><p>“I was really struggling to not beat the fuck out of her,” Rio voices, her words echoing in the tight space, a soft aura surrounding them as she wipes the last of Agatha’s tears.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t help, but scoff at the abrupt honesty, knowing Rio’s physical strength, but also the way she’d never seen Rio use it against someone maliciously, knowing that she’d only ever wield it to protect herself or the people she loves. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll have to imagine you hiding in a bush the next time I’m mid spiral,” Agatha answers, trying to find some of the light Rio had pushed in, easing her way into the calm territory Rio always stirred around them, even in the wake of disaster. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha really looks at her, her fingers combing through the ends of her hair, playing with the strands idly, her fingers gliding over her neck, her collarbone, it felt freeing, a delicate landing strip for all the hurt, freshly painted over with a smile, an attempt at pushing through the pain. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had always felt like moments of escape, a fairytale land that Rio had furnished and kept clean just for the two of them, a safety net, a home. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands were on her hips now, stroking over her belt loops, waiting patiently for whatever Agatha would push towards next. A lot of the time Agatha felt trapped in these spaces of ‘almosts’ and ‘so close’, hoping for Rio to jolt forward and finally kiss her, confess all the tragic love that sat on her tongue. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe it fully dawned on Agatha that she held that power too, that despite all the paralyzing fear, she could be the one to jump the bridge, steer them forward instead of always sitting in park with the engine on.</p><p> </p><p>What a waste of fucking gas.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha steps forward, an effort to be closer, feel Rio’s breath against her face again, but of course the brunette is taken off guard, her step falling backward as Agatha surges forward. </p><p> </p><p>For a moment, her heart takes the movement as rejection, letting the shift in Rio’s eyes settle into confusion rather than an attempt at pushing her away. Agatha was tired of taking a backseat in her own life, tired of letting other people steer. </p><p> </p><p>She pushes forward again, holding onto Rio’s shoulders, steering the woman backwards until her lower back presses into the outer edge of the sink, the sound of Rio’s pelvis hitting the porcelain louder than Agatha intended. </p><p> </p><p>Still, Rio grabs onto her, her arms clinging around Agatha’s mid section, as she comes to stand in Rio’s personal space, one hand wrapped around the back of Rio’s neck, her fingers tangled under her hair, fingertips pressed into her scalp, the other hand molded against her jaw, keeping them close, but not connecting their lips. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes are so brown, the reflection of light casting little white dots from the overhead lighting stuck into dark irises. There’s a fountain of emotion in her eyes, fear, desire, a yin and yang of all the desperate attempts at looking into the future and always coming back with empty answers. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hair and skin are so soft, a plane of exploration Agatha dreams of often, her thumb stroking over the jaw line, the way Rio seems to melt slightly at the touch, Agatha can’t imagine how intense anything else could feel if this was already overwhelming, holding Rio on the precipice of a cliff, but never crossing the caution tape. </p><p> </p><p>She looks down at Rio’s lips, unable to stop her eyes from shifting, hypnotized by the pink softness awaiting her, the glare a mix of saliva and chapstick. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” comes the wrecked whisper, the sight of Rio’s tongue adding fuel to the fire.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilts forward, but not to connect their lips, a traitorous thud as their foreheads press together instead. Rio breathes hot against her, both of their eyes screwing shut, bracing themselves. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not gonna kiss you right now,” Agatha decides, the words brushed into the small space between their faces. </p><p> </p><p>Rio whines, it's quiet and barely there, and Agatha knows the sound isn’t voluntary, but it's almost enough to make her change her mind. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want the memory to be stashed right next to another installment of Hurricane Evanora,” Agatha explains, hoping to peel away any feelings of rejection Rio might be toying with. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted Rio, and now Rio knew it. It felt like a volcano set to erupt for hundreds of years that had now laid dormant, allowing life to thrive around it. It wasn’t an explosion, instead they’d found a new island to explore, a new planet to understand. But, she could be patient a little while longer, give herself the opportunity to really choose when and where the tides would change between them. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods minutely, just enough for Agatha to feel, her cue to pull away. </p><p> </p><p>It felt strange looking at her now, like the ease of a confession that was never explicitly spoken, but now understood. Rio seemed shaken too, pulling Agatha back for a second into a full hug, seemingly needing to hold her for another moment, make sure she was whole before stepping back. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you need anything?” Rio asks, the words singing for all things she doesn’t say.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head, soaking in the calm, relishing in the way Rio had taken her off the edge of a panic attack, sent her swirling back into her own hope.</p><p> </p><p>Rio brushes hair out of Agatha’s face, strokes her cheek for a moment, like she really needs Agatha to hear her. </p><p> </p><p>“If anything happens tonight, please call me and I’ll pick you up, Mami already said you could stay the night,” Rio urges like it’s a promise, knowing Agatha had hard lines on the ways she would allow Rio to protect her, allow her to get involved to calculated extents. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand comes up to cover the one Rio has on her face, stroking at the back of her knuckles, wanting Rio to know just how much she felt her never-waning care. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll text you,” Agatha promises, “I’ll be okay.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallows, not sure if she fully agrees with the words, but she accepts it for now, pulling Agatha forward to place a delicate kiss to her hairline. </p><p> </p><p>“Go,” Agatha giggles at the contact, playfully pushing away from Rio’s hold, “Before someone comes looking for us.” The words are dismissive but she’s smiling at Rio, a soft glint of happiness in her eye, one step closer to really being with Rio the way she’d dreamt of for so long, the baby steps alone making her feel the butterflies erupt all over again. </p><p> </p><p>“The Lord is always watching,” Rio chastises like it’s a harsh truth, a sin they’d already been caught for. </p><p> </p><p>“Surprised you haven’t burst into flames in all of your years of perfect Sunday service attendance,” Agatha jokes, poking Rio in the ribs, knowing exactly where she’s ticklish. </p><p> </p><p>Rio swats at her hands. </p><p> </p><p>“Guess I could say the same about you,” Rio laughs, testing the territory of the new information.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha squints her eyes at her, fake-insulted, she moves to jab at Rio’s ribs again, but is stopped easily, Rio grabbing hold of both wrists, and holding onto them securely, Agatha hates how she loses her breath at the show of strength, hates how easily Rio melts her insides. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry, sweetheart. You wouldn’t be the first to have their queer awakening in the basement of a Catholic Church.”</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>The car ride home is quiet. Quieter than Agatha thought it would be.</p><p> </p><p>Evanora often held in her rage just long enough for them to be sealed inside her SUV, the pristine leather, the unused cup holders, the stark newness a safe place to berate her daughter. </p><p> </p><p>But, right now her mother is solely focused on the road, seemingly unmoved to spill her rage, the gospel music at a hushed volume streaming from the radio, Evanora contemplating her own thoughts more than listening. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t complain even if she knows the words will come eventually, knows it won’t be quiet forever. She lets the anticipation curl into her stomach, holds the fear in her chest alongside the festering doom. </p><p> </p><p>“You are a reflection on me. You are a reflection of God.” Evanora finally speaks.</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha wasn’t so shaken by the start of a new tirade, she would roll her eyes at the way her mother always tried to string words together like she was giving a sermon, like they were somehow meant to inspire change for the better, not overwhelm her in pain. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, mother.” Agatha answers, knowing the practiced pattern, a call and answer like they’re still stuck in those pews.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Peace be with you.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>and also with you. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows that Evanora needs to hear it, a clear message that she understands, that her words are landing squarely in Agatha’s brain.</p><p> </p><p>”You understand me. Yet you go against my words. You go against His teachings.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s a statement, not a question, no room for Agatha to defend herself. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha isn’t breathing, holding it in in hopes that perhaps she sinks into the seat, disappears from the world if it means she doesn’t have to find an answer to that. </p><p> </p><p>“I knew you were evil the day you were born,” It’s not the first time Evanora has said it, a statement she’s always deemed true out loud, perhaps the first sentence Agatha can truly remember as a child, something taught, something embedded in her reflection, an ultimate truth she can’t erase, “but I have always had hope for you Agatha. You just need to follow Him the way I’ve shown you.” </p><p> </p><p>It feels too akin to a pep talk, like Evanora was truly trying to be helpful. And Agatha knew that Evanora truly believed she was being helpful. The sting of it whips across her like a slap, shattering words that have her reeling just the same, the red in her cheeks, the unfocused expression. She needs to inhale, needs to find the will to push through. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, mother.” it’s an echo, her lips moving on autopilot, the most basic part of her brain still intact, a rhythm of protecting herself unconsciously. </p><p> </p><p>It presses out some of the hope, flattens out the willingness to fight back. But a new bloom of need surges right behind it, the desire to exist without all of the solemn shaky hurt, a desire to run from this, to plant seeds in new grass, create a home without any traces of this one. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha keeps her face neutral, sealing away the new found faith, faith in a future that doesn’t feel as cloudy, faith in herself. She knows those are things she can’t show her mother, she knows she must protect the fragile peaks, give it time to root itself, let it fester under her skin until she’s strong enough to face her and really walk away. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows that as soon as she breathes clean air, she’ll never be able to turn back. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p>Isaiah 65:17- Behold, I will create new heavens and a new Earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes it as a win when she makes it to her room without any new emotional or physical wounds. She takes a deep breath, the reflex to thank God for that fact presses hard against her chest. But even more than that, It’s a little surprising how easily it seemed Evanora was moving on.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe, her mother was above marking new bruises into her so soon after being in the Lord’s house. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe she was better off not questioning it, her brain already tracing the pattern of damage, trying to find the cause, filtering through her mother’s rationale was never an easy task. </p><p> </p><p>‘Made it to my room unscathed somehow…’ Agatha texts Rio as soon as she’s sat up in her bed, her head resting against the headboard, too emotionally drained to think about changing out of her church clothes just yet. </p><p> </p><p>’the demon is tired from cosplaying as an angel’ Rio answers a moment later.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes even if Rio can’t see it, always amused by the other girl’s refusal to refer to Evanora as anything in the realm of motherly. She’s not wrong. It used to tug in all the wrong places, reminding Agatha of the weight it held. Now it rang as validation, a voice that told her this wasn’t normal, that Rio understood.</p><p> </p><p>’back to rotting in my bed ig’ Agatha types back without much thought, resigning herself to the impending doom scrolling, the stomach growls that would eventually pull her from the mattress, a trip downstairs to stare at the nothing in the fridge, probably resorting to crackers before the inevitable return to her bed. </p><p> </p><p>‘Your bed you say??? 👀’</p><p> </p><p>The reply sort of takes Agatha off guard, a hint of jovial teasing, coated in something else, a new plane they’d never explored before. </p><p> </p><p>‘Is that your poor attempt at flirting ?’ Agatha types back, unable to stop the soft smile on her lips, the way the butterflies flung free in her stomach, the hollow fluttering a calming chaos. She tries her best to stop the way her brain tracks down new pathways, jumping to a universe where they exchange tasteful nudes (a blissful, unyielding thought that presses heat against her skin) and Evanora finding out before promptly disowning her (okay, Evanora does not belong anywhere near her horny thoughts, but thinking about never speaking to her mother again isn’t the worst possible outcome). </p><p> </p><p>‘Depends’</p><p>’am i allowed to flirt????’</p><p> </p><p>It’s a good question, Agatha supposes, wondering where they stand in all this, figuring out what’s fair game, perhaps the new normal, exploring them post almost-kissing, post knowing there’s something there. </p><p> </p><p>The relief of it settles then, not this perfect moment of love confessions, but a softer transition, less pressure, less expectation. </p><p> </p><p>It clicked something in her heart back into place, this soft feeling that made her ache in a whole different way. </p><p> </p><p>Rio cared. Maybe too much. Enough to push down her own feelings if it meant giving Agatha the space to choose for them, steer them at her own pace.</p><p> </p><p>In hindsight, Agatha wished they’d talked about it sooner, that Rio had let Agatha know she was letting her drive, waiting for her to hit the gas. It would have saved a lot of time. </p><p> </p><p>Still, she’s grateful the car’s moving, even if at a snail's pace. </p><p> </p><p>‘…tread lightly’ Agatha starts, ‘I’ll hit the breaks if I have to’</p><p> </p><p>’soooo what are you wearing? (Flirting)’ is Rio’s response because she’s an idiot. </p><p> </p><p>‘Well ik ur wearing ur clown makeup’ Agatha shakes her head, amused at her own  stupidity. </p><p> </p><p>‘Yk i never leave the house out of uniform 🫡’</p><p> </p><p>God, Rio is such a dork. </p><p> </p><p>She’s definitely not swooning over it. </p><p> </p><p>‘Btw i didnt have my gay awakening in a church basement’ Agatha starts at something new, finding herself steering them more easily. </p><p> </p><p>‘English class? Sister Hart gets you goin too?’</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorts, she should have expected this shit from Rio by now. She hates how easy this feels, how the smile on her face feels permanent, the press of it etched into her long term memories, she wants to savor every minute. </p><p> </p><p>‘I was trying to be serious 🥺’</p><p> </p><p>’my bad. The first time you’ve ever been serious’</p><p>’tell me shawty, what enlightened you?’</p><p> </p><p>God, she’s going to throw Rio’s phone out of her moving vehicle tomorrow morning, she can’t handle this, the way her hands ache to murder her for being such an insufferable dumbass (the way her hands ache to feel the soft of her skin, press kisses into any where she’s allowed, explore all the freedoms Rio is willing to give).</p><p> </p><p>‘Ehhh probably the telephone music video…the sexual tension was crazy’ Agatha answers, not entirely sure when the gay realization hit, just knowing that Lady Gaga wrapped in caution tape had been an earlier memory of feeling hot over women and then feeling shame about it. </p><p> </p><p>‘Can I be Beyoncé in this scenario?’ </p><p> </p><p>‘You just want a honey bun 😡’ Agatha jokes, even if she knows Rio would probably be easily swayed by the fact that Beyoncé eats a Honey Bun in the music video and Rio has been known to be motivated by sugar. </p><p> </p><p>‘Just tryna eat ur honey bun 😝’ Rio answers because she’s absolutely unhinged. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallows, would never admit the way it made her imagine Rio in places she never allowed her mind to explore, would take years of torture to get her to confess that Rio’s joke had gotten her head spinning. </p><p> </p><p>‘Alright…ur officially in time out’</p>

<p>Hebrews 11:1- Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.</p><p> </p><p>”Agatha”, she hears her mother call her name from downstairs, but the tone of it isn’t as darkly commanding, “Dinner’s ready”</p><p> </p><p>Dinner? </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t like it never happened, Evanora making dinner, but it was usually reserved for Wednesday’s and their standard ritual of sharing one meal a week, keeping Agatha from completely forgetting the talons she existed under. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried to push down the feeling that this was a trap, wanting to believe that the light feel of her mother’s voice wasn’t another clever veil, an extended olive branch she’d use the thorns of later.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she moves her feet, knowing that the consequences were inevitable and refusing her mother’s requests only ever made the punishments worse. </p><p> </p><p>It’s meatloaf, not exactly Agatha’s favorite, but it didn’t look like poison, and Agatha could fuck up some mashed potatoes even if they were instant from a box. She finds it hard to complain as she sits in her designated seat, just left of her mother who always sat at the head of the table, a throne to symbolize her power. This was at least more substantial than crackers, maybe her stomach wouldn’t growl as hard as usual tomorrow.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows better than to dive right in, leading them in prayer before every shared meal since she could speak. She looks at Evanora to make sure she’s ready before clasping her hands together, closing her eyes, bowing her head. </p><p> </p><p>“Dear Heavenly Father, We thank you for this nourishment and for the hands that prepared it. May this food give us the strength to serve You well. In Jesus’ name we pray. Amen.” Agatha’s voice is even, something so certain in the words, a practiced lullaby that had brought her comfort for a long time. It feels stale on her tongue, a whisper of denial, a breath that gives her the room to wonder why she so often went without food.</p><p> </p><p>“Amen”, always comes Evanora’s soft echo. Agatha looks to her again, a gentle smile on Evanora’s lips, the only time it’s ever directed at her daughter, a completion of their ritual.  </p><p> </p><p>Agatha always picks up her fork with a pit in her stomach. A conflict in the way she desperately wants to cling to that second of maternal affection casted over her, but knowing in her bones that this is not love, this is something twisted and evil, a droplet of love enough to keep her from wilting into nothing, keeping her misted enough to stay alive, but never grow. </p><p> </p><p>She let’s Evanora take a bite first, always. A small gesture that makes her feel less likely to die at the hands of antifreeze or arsenic mixed into green beans. </p><p> </p><p>And she hates that she has to think like that, hates that the motives of a home cooked meal have to come into question. It felt like a carrot dangling within her reach, a reward for good behavior when Agatha had done nothing but embarrass her, enrage her. She wrestles with the perplexity of it, Evanora treating her kindly after she’d been caught skipping Sunday service. It doesn’t make any sense. </p><p> </p><p>It hits her the hardest in these quiet moments that this is not normal. It’s easier to disassociate when the physical abuse is actively happening, easier to pretend this isn’t reality when the bruises are healing and Evanora is far away. But, now they’re close, pretending this is what they do, have cozy dinners, are pleasant to each other when no one else is around, that Evanora does anything without a scheme brewing. </p><p> </p><p>“I was thinking I’d give you my credit card.” Evanora states like it doesn’t warrant any follow up questions.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha half-stunned by the words, waits for an explanation without asking. </p><p> </p><p>“I figured you might want to go to the mall and start looking for a prom dress.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha almost chokes on her mashed potatoes.</p><p> </p><p>”I thought I wasn’t allow-“ Agatha starts tentatively, recounting their past conversations about how school dances were for ‘sluts’ and how Evanora would get rid of them entirely if it wouldn’t cause ‘student outrage’.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve decided you need a little more freedom.” Her mother cuts her off, but it doesn’t ring in her ears harshly, the words finding a home on a plane of understanding.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s confused. </p><p> </p><p>Is Evanora trying?</p><p> </p><p>It’s a trap. It must be a trap.</p><p> </p><p>Evanora must see the hesitation there. She continues.</p><p> </p><p>”You’re getting older, dear.” The term of endearment feels foreign, but Agatha can’t think too much about it before she keeps explaining, her voice vulnerable, but solid, “Soon, you’ll be looking for a husband, settling down, starting a family. Perhaps, I haven’t given you the room to grow into that role.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s still confused. She knows the expectation, a path to her future that has been drilled into her since the womb. The people to love and cherish a short list of God, her husband, and her children. In that order. But, she’s not sure what a prom dress has to do with this. </p><p> </p><p>“Prom is going to prepare me to be a wife?” Agatha speaks slowly, no contempt in her voice, knowing speaking out of turn has resulted in hair brushes whacked into  the back of the head, pinches to her arms. She truly wants to understand.</p><p> </p><p>”No,” Evanora is looking down at her plate again, not giving Agatha the eye contact she wants, a play she isn’t ready to show, “Not exactly.”</p><p> </p><p>”But, the event is hosted with St. Vincent’s, as you know,” Evanora continues, mentioning the all-boys Catholic school they planned all co-ed festivities with, “It will give you the opportunity to socialize and get some understanding of how to orient yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>”Okay.” Agatha agrees, mostly because she’s unsure how else to respond. But she tries not to seem too eager, still holding fear that this was a carefully planned trap, an episode of Punk’d except there were no cameras, just the pitiful sting of her mother’s hands on her.</p><p> </p><p>”Very good.” Evanora nods her approval, seemingly done with the conversation.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t know what to feel. She’s honestly confused Evanora seems so willing to give her away, not for any misplaced notion that Evanora wanted her around, but because she didn't know if her mother could fully relinquish control. She’d always thought her husband would be hand picked, someone just as cruel, or at the very least blind enough to let her mother continue to exist as a dictator, keep her tightly wound in her bloodied ribbon. </p><p> </p><p>But, Evanora was encouraging her to fraternize? Get comfy with boys? at a party? </p><p> </p><p>Okay, a chaperoned, no-alcohol-allowed school event, but a party nonetheless.</p><p> </p><p>When Evanora hands over her credit card after dinner, Agatha’s still edging on the side of caution. Her mother marks the exchange with a single word.</p><p> </p><p>”Modesty” A warning.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe that’s the crux of it. A test. A test to see if Agatha can pick out a dress that doesn’t discount her mother’s devotion to God, to see if Agatha can follow directions. </p><p> </p><p>It still feels like a set up. A prank. A joke. A dream. Anything other than reality.</p><p> </p><p>But with it comes a searing curdle of something else, a bubble in her stomach that runs along the highway of her nerves. </p><p> </p><p>This warmth at her mother being…nice.</p><p> </p><p>And after all the harm, Agatha wishes it took more than a single meal without an insult to make her feel something, but Evanora had set the bar extremely low.</p><p> </p><p>She tries to swallow down the quiet string of hope, that there was something human and redeemable inside her mother, that perhaps she could change even if molecule by molecule into something less demon-shaped.</p><p> </p><p>It felt like plucking one hair at a time, the pinch of pain releasing into a dull itch. The pain of the thick pill to swallow, less harrowing than the headache she takes it for. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p>Ephesians 4:22-24 - You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. </p><p> </p><p>“I just think it’s weird,” Rio laments, trying to air on the side of caution without striking down all the hope in Agatha’s expression, “She has to have some other motive.”</p><p> </p><p>They’re in the hallway in between classes, Agatha rummaging through her locker trying to find her History textbook buried under loose worksheets and unused binders. Keeping her locker organized would be a lot easier if she hadn’t allowed Rio to use it, the assortment of candy wrappers amongst the chaos definitely from the taller girl.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs, finally finding the book wedged into the bottom, standing up straight again to close her locker, doing her best to find the words to explain.</p><p> </p><p>”Maybe I’m stupid for it, but a part of me wants to believe she’s turning a new leaf.” Agatha shrugs, finally meeting Rio’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>They’d been talking about Evanora all day in small moments, in Rio’s car this morning, a note passed during English class, walking through hallways in between class, a conversation they kept coming back to.</p><p> </p><p>It seemed like they were both trying to grapple with it, puzzle out exactly why Agatha’s mother, who had been hellbent on traumatizing her for the past almost 18 years, was suddenly acting …understanding? Cool? Like she cared?</p><p> </p><p>And the worst part was that it had an unclear direction, stood in common ground enough that it wasn’t automatically a definite ploy. Because Evanora wanting Agatha to get married and have kids had always been part of the calculated plan God had laid out for her, but the direct encouragement towards it was new. The way she’d been calm and undemanding about it was new too. </p><p> </p><p>”If the new leaf is finding you a husband, I guess that’s not the biggest leap,” Rio scoffs through her own reasoning, “Like that part makes sense.”</p><p> </p><p>”It’s strange,” Agatha ponders as they walk away from her locker, the fullness of the hallway effectively shielding their conversation from pesky eavesdropping, the blend of voices hard to untangle from each other, “She’s still giving me bare minimum, less than bare minimum,” she corrects herself. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s still different than usual, you said she was actually kind of nice?” </p><p> </p><p>“She looked at me like I wasn’t the ugliest thing she’s ever seen,” Agatha laughs like it’s funny, not an insecurity her mother had clawed into her identity.</p><p> </p><p>”Calling you ugly is crazy,” Rio chirps like it’s second nature, like this wasn’t still so new, the clarity that there were feelings between them, a journey they still had yet to explore… life, Evanora, getting in the way. “That demon needs her eyes checked.”</p><p> </p><p>”Alright, simp.” Agatha tries to hide the slight blush that coats her cheeks, “My knight in shining armor isn’t on the clock right now.”</p><p> </p><p>”First of all, I’d look great in armor.” Rio turns to her, raising an eyebrow, daring Agatha to disagree, she doesn’t. “Secondly, I’m a proud simp, so you’re not insulting me. And thirdly, I better be getting paid for this”.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes playfully, letting the cheesy stupidity of it settle against her chest.</p><p> </p><p>The simplicity of it felt almost nauseating, the slow pedaling of Rio’s attempts at flirting shifted seamlessly into their existing friendship. Like a testament to all the time they’d spent holding back, the way Agatha wouldn’t allow the pipe to burst now, giving time for the faucet to leak slowly for a while, offer them a chance to find their sea legs before blasting them with the entire ocean.</p><p> </p><p>It felt like a welcome trickle, just enough to quench her thirst, breathe through the moments of astonishment that Rio was really looking at her like that, saying these things to her, meaning them. It felt like another universe, an existence where happiness didn’t have to feel like somewhere she’d never reach, where joy could effortlessly be sewn into the spaces they got to create together. </p><p> </p><p>“So, what’s the move, simp?” Agatha reigns back the butterflies in her stomach, breathes in for the sake of steadying her thoughts, willing herself to stay patient, build the bricks of their relationship with care. Now that she knew of feelings, it changed nothing about the way she refused to let it ruin them, their connection would always be something to be cherished, and if doing this right meant pushing through the desire to push Rio into the lockers in front of everyone and kiss her like their lives depended on it, she’d settle for knocking their shoulders together for now. </p><p> </p><p>“I guess we find you a prom dress.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs. Dejected. Wondering if she’d ever have clarity on her mother’s chess moves, wondering where truth and manipulation intersected. </p><p> </p><p>“You have something to wear yet?” Agatha asks, purposely trying to sway the subject a little, tired of trying to understand Evanora’s potential scheme. </p><p> </p><p>“No,” Rio sighs, “I was thinking a suit at first, but I think a nun might faint at the sight and I don’t want to be liable for any holy deaths.”</p><p> </p><p>”So, no suit,” Agatha chimes in, almost cementing it, but also inserting it to air it out once more, loving the idea of a fitted tux on Rio, the thought of pulling her closer by her suspenders, the clean silhouette of her shoulders and hips. Agatha shook her head, pressing away the thoughts, coating herself in the sympathy that Rio didn’t have the full freedom to express the dichotomy of her masculine and feminine sides in their very strict Catholic school.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not that bummed,” Rio seems to read Agatha’s mind, “I wear a tie to school like everyday,” her hand comes up, subconsciously tugging at the knot of it at the front of her throat.</p><p> </p><p>”A dress will be nice too.” Agatha says, an attempt at a compliment, still piecing together exactly how forward she wanted to be, not sure what she was willing to confess out loud, afraid of what her words might indirectly confess. Maybe Rio didn’t need to know the exact parameters of her intense yearning just yet.</p><p> </p><p>Here, Agatha was, stuck in her own insecurity, walking a tightrope of too much or too little, when Rio had just been adamant about being a ‘proud simp’. </p><p> </p><p>Just give her time. She’s figuring it out. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you think it’s less fucked up if a nun faints from me in a dress?” Rio asks, her eyes actually curious. </p><p> </p><p>“How much skin are we trying to show?” Agatha laughs as they finally make it to their classroom, finding their usual seats towards the middle, the cover of the first few rows a safe place for Rio to doodle all class long and for Agatha to pretend to pay attention. </p><p> </p><p>“How much is faint worthy?” Rio asks with a smirk, and Agatha’s glad they’re sitting down, her brain tracing over every instance that she’s thought about Rio’s soft skin, all the places she’d only dreamt of touching. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha blushes, doesn’t try to hide it, revels in the way Rio smiles at her, the way it reaches her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>The classroom starts filling up, an indication that this conversation was coming to an end for now, a sign they were never good at following.</p><p> </p><p>“At this school, a dry elbow would be scandalous,” Agatha whispers, moving forward with a safe answer.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasps, fake-offended.</p><p> </p><p>”You think I don’t moisturize? I’m not a monster.” Rio is whisper yelling, and Agatha hates how endearing she is.</p><p> </p><p>”Shut up,” Agatha laughs at her, “Class is starting.” She throws her pencil the short distance between them, hitting Rio in the chin.</p><p> </p><p>”Dude, you could have taken my eye out,” Rio says, her voice taking on a more serious tone, still quiet but more of a grumble than a whisper. </p><p> </p><p>“Shhhhhhh,” comes the shrill sound from a few desks over as Sister Edith enters the room. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifts her head, tearing her eyes away from Rio and the adorable mark of graphite now adorning her face, just above her left laugh line. She finds Wanda looking towards them, mostly at Rio as she was the last of them to make noise, her eyebrows raised as if questioning them, wondering where they found the audacity to speak to each other in a class that hadn't even started.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha wishes she could say that Wanda might be joking, but she knew the girl was completely serious, borderline offended that her and Rio weren’t experts at falling in line with the rest of the class. </p><p> </p><p>Rio makes a funny face at Wanda, crossing her eyes and sticking out her tongue. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda huffs, still clearly annoyed, disgusted by Rio’s lack of seriousness, a point of contention that had long existed between them as classmates, less intense than enemies, but never clicking as anything close to friends.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had even come to Wanda’s defense in the past, when Agatha’s anger ran too hot, saving them all the headache of making something into a fight that was never serious enough to get that far.</p><p> </p><p>But in all the ways Rio was free spirited, Wanda was tightly wound. </p><p> </p><p>Either way, it gets Wanda to look away, face forward at her desk, dissolve back into the mechanics of obedient woman of God, diligent student. </p><p> </p><p>As Sister Edith starts her opening remarks, Agatha finds herself doing the doodling for once, tearing off the corner of her loose leaf before drawing her best rendition of a clown, big round nose, wide smile and Wanda’s name written below it, perhaps some of her best work.</p><p> </p><p>She folds it, sliding it to Rio while the teacher’s writing on the board. </p><p> </p><p>The ease of Rio’s smile feels like a blooming flower, a patch of mended clothing, a warmth of hot chocolate in her brown eyes that surges Agatha’s heart at the fact that she’d brought it out, she’d bow if given a stage to gloat. </p><p> </p><p>Rio rips up the small bit of paper without any hesitance, effectively silencing Agatha’s masterpiece. Agatha can’t help the way her own face morphs, her eyes widen, surprised by the action.</p><p> </p><p>But, brown eyes find her again, an air of amusement mixed with something else.</p><p> </p><p>’ur such a bully’ a new slip of paper says, balled up and tossed to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, because Rio was too nice, a reminder of all the sappy good in her heart, pushing Agatha to do the right thing, be a better person, even if no one else was watching. It was infuriating. It was charming. </p><p> </p><p>She flattens the paper before starting a new doodle. Another clown, an even bigger smile. Rio’s name scrawled underneath, a firm arrow pointing from her name to the image so that no mistaken identity could take place. </p><p> </p><p>Rio has to visibly hold in her laugh, shaking her head at the paper. </p><p> </p><p>It sort of felt like Agatha’s own version of flirting, a twisted expression of care, trying to give Rio the joy she effortlessly carried for everyone else. Agatha wanted to be that safety net for her too, show her that she could be good enough. She’d spend forever trying to prove that to herself. </p><p> </p><p>Like they were kids on a playground and Agatha was pushing Rio into the mud because she couldn’t express her big feelings any other way. She at least hoped it landed that way for Rio. </p><p> </p><p>‘lucky ur pretty’ the note says when it comes back to Agatha. Rio smiles goofily as she stares toward the front of the classroom, not giving Agatha the satisfaction of finding her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>It’s then that Agatha wishes the chunk of paper had more room, wishes that she had walls to fill with all the bewitching fortune she’s thought about her best friend, paint murals with all the flawless beauty she saw in Rio, paint the night sky with stars that burst alongside the pulse of her heart, fill word documents with clumsy poems, describe the brown of Rio’s eyes, the mysterious glint of emotion that Agatha was always trying to capture, take up clotheslines with pinned Polaroids of her smile, the one she pulls out in true laughter, not the one she’d practiced for school pictures. </p><p> </p><p>It’s scary. Trying to stir away the desire to claim it all out loud at once, the spill of emotions that have been building for years. She’s not sure if she’s ready for the damn to break, the routine of holding back stamped into every interaction even with the permission to push past the old limits. </p><p> </p><p>She toys with all the possibilities, hunting in her mind for the perfect thing to to write, the one word or phrase that will tell Rio what she needs to tell her, something true, something grounding yet clear. Anything. Anything to tell her of all the comfort she tracks into Agatha’s tragic world, the angel that steers her thoughts back to Rio when she’s drowning in pain, the beauty she sees on the surface and underneath that she wields so easily. </p><p> </p><p>Something to say, ‘I like you’ in the way Rio had with all her flirty quips, without it feeling extremely juvenile, a far cry from the weight she was putting on this. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha crumples the paper back into a ball, lets it sit on the edge of her desk, pushes away the desire for now. She doesn’t look at Rio, can’t explain it to her right now, can’t stomach the retreat. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>“So, I don’t think I know how to flirt.” Agatha blurts as soon as they’re settled into Rio’s car, not enough time to buckle up or plug her phone into the aux. </p><p> </p><p>“What are you talking about?” Rio sort of scoffs, a mixture of amused and confused, wondering why the sudden confession had felt necessary. </p><p> </p><p>“I just, I don’t know, it seems so easy for you, and I don’t know how to like say…that stuff,” Agatha feels overwhelmed by how much she feels for Rio, how long she’s tucked it all into a safe and threw away the key. Now that Rio was opening that door without fear, it felt like a day she had never prepared for. The words feel flimsy as they leave her mouth, trying to be vulnerable, trying to be honest for the sake of this ever working. She knows she wouldn’t have even brought it up in front of anyone that wasn’t Rio, this safety something specific to them. </p><p> </p><p>“That you like me?” Rio’s smug, because of course. Rio knows exactly how to meet Agatha’s openness, never making her feel uncomfortable, opting to tease her rather than pity her, never drawing attention to the way this version of Agatha was hard to encounter. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio” Agatha warns her, staring at her like this isn’t their usual dance, like she isn’t grateful for the way they seem to always understand exactly what the other needs. </p><p> </p><p>“So you’re telling me when you drew me as a clown earlier, that wasn’t flirting?” Rio asks, somewhat serious, the edge of it still light. </p><p> </p><p>“It was. I just- that’s different than saying the actual words.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio is momentarily distracted, finally putting the car in reverse and driving them out of the parking lot. Agatha takes the moment to recollect herself, try to gather the words she wants to say. </p><p> </p><p>“I think your flirting is fine,” Rio comments, hoping it quells the insecurity, not trying to make a big deal out of it.</p><p> </p><p>”Fine? Just fine? I’m trying to wow you here,” Agatha jokes, letting the big feelings leak out a little, under the mask of making fun of herself. </p><p> </p><p>Rio giggles, offering her a side glance, focused on the road. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, for real though,” Agatha puts them back on task, not ready to let the conversation go, “How do you flirt?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs, searching her brain for the answer, seemingly dedicating actual thought to the question.</p><p> </p><p>”I don’t think about how I flirt, it kinda comes naturally, maybe it’s the way my parents are with each other”</p><p> </p><p>”I really don’t want to think about your parents right now,” Agatha gripes, a little grossed out at the thought of the Vidal’s getting freaky. Rio only laughs at her response, almost like she knew the thoughts it would conjure up.</p><p> </p><p>”I mean they had to have sex at least once for me to exist,” Rio offers factually, not disturbed by it, very comfortable with how in love her parents always were, the differences of their childhoods coming to the forefront. Maybe familial affection wouldn’t seem so weird to Agatha if she’d experienced it in any sense. </p><p> </p><p>”I love your parents, but please never say those words again,” Agatha grimaces, thinking she’s at least successfully gotten them off of that topic. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re flirting with me right now,” Rio comments like it’s nothing. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m telling you how I don’t want to hear about your mother and father fucking, how is that flirting?” </p><p> </p><p>“First of all, they don’t fuck. They make love.” Rio voices, only half a joke, enough to make Agatha roll her eyes, and jump in before she can continue.</p><p> </p><p>”If you weren’t driving right now, I’d punch you.” Agatha warns her. </p><p> </p><p>“See! There you are flirting again.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stops at a red light, finally giving them time to look at each other for more than a fleeting second. </p><p> </p><p>“Stop messing with me,” Agatha lifts her hand, flicking Rio in the arm as punishment.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m not messing with you,” Rio promises, grabbing onto Agatha’s extended hand before it can fully retreat back to her side of the car, she takes it gently, pulling it up to her mouth, pressing a delicate kiss to Agatha’s knuckles as the light turns green and she puts her foot back on the gas.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swoons, her heart collapsing in on itself, the instant warmth of the action buzzing through her. Rio, this perfect motherfucker, and her super powers tugging away all the cold fear, curse this woman and her unyielding calm, the firm paintbrush coating Agatha in tranquility, in certainty, in love. </p><p> </p><p>“Please explain” is all she can conjure as a response, her brain unable to find logic with her hand being held like she deserves to be cradled and protected. </p><p> </p><p>Rio interlaces their fingers, cautiously thinking the way she often does before saying something she truly means, the musings that Agatha had always found meaningful and profound. She does her best to focus on anticipating the words and not how hot Rio looks steering with one hand, the flex of her forearm, as her other hand stays occupied holding onto hers.</p><p> </p><p>”You pretending to be annoyed with me, or threatening to hit me, maybe to someone else, it’s just you being violent. But I know how you communicate, I know if you truly didn’t care, you wouldn’t even respond. You wouldn’t give me the energy if it didn’t matter to you.”</p><p> </p><p>”You think I’m<em> pretending</em> to be annoyed with you?” Agatha answers, calling her logic into question instead of being serious, pushing away the sharp jolt of tenderness that comes as a result of Rio’s words, the way Rio had understood her, saw her for all the ways she was different and sought to love those parts of her just as fiercely. </p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles, knowing the words landed when Agatha squeezes her hand, even if the other girl can’t verbalize what they mean to her.</p><p> </p><p>”You can never be serious,” Rio laughs, not mad at it, more of an observation.</p><p> </p><p>”Sorry, sorry, I’ll be serious” </p><p> </p><p>“Do I actually annoy you?” Rio asks as she turns the corner onto Agatha’s block.</p><p> </p><p>“Sometimes,” Agatha answers honestly, causing Rio to gasp theatrically before she can even get an explanation out, “but only when you’re being adorable or being really protective and I get annoyed because it makes me freak out cause I like you so much.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles bright at that, the glint in her eye, the little gap in her teeth shown without hesitation, it all flies back towards Agatha like a slingshot, the joy of it plastered on them both. </p><p> </p><p>”Agatha Harkness! Was that a flirting attempt?” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god! Shut up!” Agatha blushes, pulling her hand out of Rio’s grip to cover her face, wondering when she had jumped from repressed crush to absolute bumbling mess from her own words about Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, now I’m never shutting up. Who else is going to annoy you by being too adorable?” Rio teases as she puts the car in park a few houses down from Agatha’s. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re the worst.” Agatha peaks out from her hands, not fully pulling them away from her face yet. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think you believe that.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans, replanting her hands over her face as Rio fully turns to her in her seat, hoping the sad scratched leather decides to open up and swallow her whole. One day of flirting and she was already crumbling. Pathetic. </p><p> </p><p>“Lemme see your pretty face.” Rio mumbles, pulling Agatha’s hands away, holding onto both hands, she lets them settle into this new territory where they’re deciding how they fit together without the strict boundaries.</p><p> </p><p>One of Agatha’s hands grazes up her forearm, finds a home in tracing the inner side of her her elbow, exploring soft skin under fingertips, memorizing the birthmark there, but also knowing its a place she’ll have time to revisit, safety in the way time never felt limited with Rio. The calm in quiet that fills the space of the car, Rio never starting her playlist after Agatha’s impromptu conversation. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up from where her hand has landed after a few moments, finally finding the courage to face this reality, giving herself the chance to breathe in the truth of it, learn how to exist here. She finds Rio’s eyes, the delicate brown meeting her with this kind patience, the open heart Rio held up for her without a second thought. </p><p> </p><p>“I like how you flirt,” Rio breaks the silence, it's firm but quiet, Agatha knows she isn’t joking, “keeps me on my toes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, a gentle smile returning to her face, letting the words soak through the jagged exterior, letting it feel true. </p><p> </p><p>“And the threat of violence is kinda hot.” Rio adds.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swats at her instantly, tapping against the forearm she’d just been rubbing against soothingly.</p><p> </p><p>”See! Exactly! You get it!” Rio answers, fueled by the way Agatha fell right into her trap, proving her point. </p><p> </p><p>She just shakes her head, but still smiles, feeling at ease in all the change, the slow pace of it lulling her like the sway of a hammock.</p><p> </p><p>She thinks of cuddling Rio fully, being close enough to hold her, tangle their limbs without overthinking anything, settling in the warmth of her, sleeping next to her, finding her dreams as more than an escape, waking up without being disappointed with reality. For once, Agatha finds comfort in all the things they have yet to explore, all the new mountains they’ll get to climb, a part of her can’t wait, but she tries to quiet that raging desire, savoring each breath. </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes her other hand, playing with her fingers, allowing Agatha to breeze through the journey of her thoughts, never rushing her to speak. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up at her again, emboldened to push them forward even if only an inch.</p><p> </p><p>She moves forward, her hand coming up to the side of Rio’s neck, wanting them both to know her intentions before stepping over a new line she wasn’t ready to cross, angling her enough to press a kiss into her cheek, linger in the closeness, seal it somewhere in the truth that she wanted this, wanted Rio to know that she wanted this. </p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Sorry it’s been a hot minute since last chapter..i think this one took me a while to wrap my head around because I felt like I was pushing on the hard stuff so intensely and I don’t want that to be the whole narrative…Rio is sort of the happy moments between Agatha’s roughest moments and I want to give that time to exist on it’s own too…that being said I think I’ve found the refocus and really evaluated how I want the plot to progress…I’ve found myself really caring about this story and how these characters end up and it means so much to me that other people seem to care about it too.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed this lighter chapter and maybe a little bit of a breather from Evanora being super evil…but brace yourself for future chapters lol</p><p>As always any feedback means so much to be so thank you for all your comments</p><p>ALSO question: I haven’t fully thought of what I’d do with the information/I haven’t specified like an exact month or time that this fic is taking place but id like to know if anyone has thoughts about Agatha and Rio’s birthdays (I dont know of anything that’s canon) but i guess I’d have to figure out what signs I think suit them and if including a birthday would make sense/support the plot here….but yeah when do you headcanon their birthdays????</p></blockquote>

<p>Jeremiah 29:11- ‘For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord. ‘Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future’. </p><p> </p><p>“This has to be considered cruel and unusual punishment,” Alice laughs as Agatha grumbles towards the ground even if she didn’t mean it as a joke. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio seems to be having fun,” Alice comments, nodding a few feet in front of them to direct Agatha’s attention towards her, like reminding her of the girl’s presence changes the current task, as if Agatha hadn’t been chancing a pattern of glances towards the brunette every few seconds, something grounding about having the other girl in her line of sight. </p><p> </p><p>They’re doing their monthly community service, a school requirement for St. Elizabeth students, a planned event that can range from handing out fliers with Jesus hanging from the cross on them (blood and guts printed in full color) to picking up trash from the side of the highway. Maybe the current predicament wasn’t the worst possible option, but working in a community garden wasn’t exactly Agatha’s definition of fun. </p><p> </p><p>Alice and Agatha were relegated to the job of pulling weeds, even given the proper tool (and an enthusiastic demonstration from Rio), Agatha didn’t have the patience or upper-body strength to complete the task without complaining the entire way through. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha answers, looking up towards Rio as if she hadn’t been tracking her through the crowd of classmates the entire time they were here, “Cuz she’s a nerd.”</p><p> </p><p>”I didn’t realize she was so into gardening,” Alice muses, not meeting Agatha’s snark, as she holds open the industrial sized trash bag for Agatha to drop another clump of weeds into.</p><p> </p><p>In another time, Agatha might have been jealous of the way Alice seemed to be invested in Rio specifically right now, but the last week or so of clarity had cleared some of that charged delusion. Alice and Jen were their friends. Or at least they were friendly. She knew Alice well enough to read it as well-intentioned curiosity, not some violent ploy that she needed to read into. </p><p> </p><p>Not to mention, Rio played the role of garden fairy a little too well. More than Rio being a natural leader, she simply adapted to different roles easily. It reminded Agatha of how they swam around each other, the push and the pull, Rio always being the support in places Agatha couldn’t hold herself up, but also giving her the freedom to pedal her own bike. Agatha had not been given the power to see into the future, but she could feel in her bones that Rio would do something big, would dream far past anything Agatha had the ambition for and make those dreams reality. </p><p> </p><p>It was evident in the way she held herself now, the way their classmates seemed magnetized to her instruction, asking her for clarification on how much to water different plants, if they were digging deep enough into the soil, the way she guided gently, but firmly, the kindness in allowing others to learn through trial and error. </p><p> </p><p>Rio and Jen were planting hydrangeas, a pattern of bushes along the edge of a bed of soil, she made it look simple, something therapeutic in the way the dirt ran through her hands, found home underneath her fingernails. </p><p> </p><p>“She really likes plants, I’m pretty sure Earth day is her favorite holiday,” Agatha answers, amused by her own revelation. </p><p> </p><p>Alice smiles softly, thinking to herself for a moment, looking like she has something to say, but not knowing how to say it. Agatha sort of holds her breath for a second, an anxious thought of hoping Alice keeps her mouth shut.</p><p> </p><p>”You two are cute together.” It isn’t a question, something certain in the way Alice offers her the words without room for argument, like Alice means them in whatever capacity it might hold. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face scrunches, but maybe more out of surprise than confusion, she feels the wrinkle in her nose before she can stop it (a facial expression that made Rio’s eyes soften everytime it came out involuntarily). She doesn’t know exactly how to process it, how to let it be true, how to handle the reality that whatever is between her and Rio is tangible, something Alice can grasp without the confirmation of words, even if Alice is just talking about friendship, it’s still an energy that radiates, a sharp taste of something she can’t name. </p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to say anything,” Alice qualifies her own statement, willing the possible worry out of Agatha before she can cement it out loud. Something a friend would do. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha just sort of nods, smiles slightly, tries to tamp down the desire to negate Alice’s words, over-explain, overcomplicate. A softness she’s not sure she’s ever fully directed at Alice, but it doesn’t unsettle her. She focuses on the weeds instead pulling another section free. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you wanna swap for a while, Harkness?” Jen’s voice is closer than expected, distracted by the previous conversation, looking up to find her stepping towards them, wiping her hands on her pants, the material already dirty with soil.</p><p> </p><p>Jen looks to Alice, a delicate smile, a look of something Agatha couldn’t read, but no malice behind it. </p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Agatha voices, “Never knew Jennifer Kale was an angel in disguise,” she adds, handing her the weed puller with a little extra force, something dramatic in the hand off, wondering when her banter had lost its bite.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not,” Jen scoffs, “Rio’s just on her sixth tirade about photosynthesis and my ears are starting to bleed.” </p><p> </p><p>Yeah, that tracks. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushes forward toward Rio, finding her heart settle like a planet starting a new orbit around the sun, blowing a strand of hair out of her own face, pulling her gardening gloves up securely, something to do with her hands. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” comes out sort of breathless even from walking the short distance, as she kneels into the grass next to Rio, immediately taking notice of Rio’s smug expression, obviously pleased with herself.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha can’t help the laugh that finds the air around Rio’s amusement, trying to see where her attention lay, seemingly finished with the hydrangeas in front of them.</p><p> </p><p>”I might have been purposely annoying Jen,” The mischief swimming in brown irises sort of makes Agatha feel like she’s corrupted her, dragging her down too far to ever get innocent Rio back. It still makes her lungs quake, something alluring in Rio acting on her ulterior motives. </p><p> </p><p>“Mmm, I think you were just being yourself and didn’t mind the consequences of her needing to get away from you,” Agatha jokes, taking the trowel out of Rio’s hands with more aggression than necessary.</p><p> </p><p>Rio snatches it back grumbling.</p><p> </p><p>”You can just say you missed me too”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles at her, admiring the firm pout on her lips. </p><p> </p><p>“I did miss you,” Agatha elbows her, sliding in closer, her voice low, shielded from the rest of their classmates. </p><p> </p><p>Rio bites back a smile, not wanting to give Agatha the immediate satisfaction, both of them knowing the play of Rio acting hurt by Agatha’s verbal daggers, but blue eyes can read the soft way the brunette’s face brightens with the words.</p><p> </p><p>”C’mon,” Rio suddenly pushes up to her feet, taking Agatha’s hand to help her up too.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t ask where they’re going, content to let Rio guide them. She doesn’t have to wait long for an intended destination to be clear, approaching the diminishing crates of plants still waiting to find homes in the garden, an untouched group of purple flowers hidden behind roses.</p><p> </p><p>”I thought you might want to help plant the azaleas,” Rio offers swiftly, lifting the crate with ease, eyeing Agatha like the offer was simple. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s knees shake in moments like this, moments where Rio is effortlessly thoughtful, offering her a token of her love and expecting nothing in return, saving Agatha’s favorite flowers for them to plant together. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re sweet,” Agatha comments, unable to push towards teasing for once, maybe spurred on by Alice’s earlier commentary. Agatha’s hand settles over one of Rio’s even if it’s busy holding onto the crate. </p><p> </p><p>“Can I help you with the azaleas?” Wanda’s voice startles them both, breaking the safety blooming around them. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha drops her hand back to her side, trying to find words, about to tell Wanda to get lost, find someone else to bother. </p><p> </p><p>“I think we’re set,” Rio smiles at her politely, not trying to seem rude, but also dismissing the thought that Wanda had any chance in joining them, “There’s still a few other cool plants to choose from.”</p><p> </p><p>A beat passes over them, Wanda still watching them, but Rio and Agatha not walking away either.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns to fully face Agatha again, offering her the crate in her arms, prompting Agatha to grab hold of it, settle the new weight into her arms without a word, Rio seems to tell her to hold on, to give her a moment, to remember to breathe just in the seconds long exchange.</p><p> </p><p>”Here”, Rio turns back to Wanda, crouching beside them to lift another crate, “Hyssop” she offers the new crate of darker purple shrubs to Wanda, hoping the other girl takes it as easily as Agatha had, “For purification.” </p><p> </p><p>“Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.” Wanda voices like she’s reading from a teleprompter.</p><p> </p><p>Another beat of silence passes, Agatha and Rio waiting for Wanda to react in a way that isn’t a quoted verse, give them some indication of emotion. </p><p> </p><p>“Psalm 51:7” Wanda adds around a laugh, like she found it immensely silly that the two other girls hadn’t supplied the name and number, “Thanks, Rio.” She adds happily, finally taking the crate from Rio’s hands and turning to walk away.</p><p> </p><p>”That girl needs a horse tranquilizer,” Agatha mumbles when there’s a respectable distance between them. </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes the crate from her hands with a laugh on her lips. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think I’ve ever asked you why you like azaleas,” Rio muses while hard at work, getting to work spreading the soil, making sure there’s adequate room for the budding plants to take root. </p><p> </p><p>Thankfully, the flower grew best in partial shade, shielding Agatha’s sensitive skin and bright eyes from direct sunlight, but also providing a healthy amount of distance between them and the rest of the teenage girls planting and weeding and shearing over the garden like worker ants. </p><p> </p><p>“A few reasons,” Agatha shrugs, spreading mulch around the area, not meeting Rio’s eyes, trying to gage how much she wanted to explain. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks up, sensing the hesitation, not pushing Agatha to spill her guts, waiting, pondering. It always felt like a safety net, the press of silence never something offensive between them, but a place for them to just be. A plateau of force where Agatha had all the power to say the words or let it rest. </p><p> </p><p>“I think I’ve mentioned before,” Agatha recounts, letting the course of the story hang in the air for a moment, feeling the breeze pass as it shudders through the foliage. “Sister Calderu and my mother used to be close friends.” </p><p> </p><p>Their hands brush in the mulch, Rio’s hand warm and certain, maybe an accident, maybe a ploy at support. They both hear the grit of Agatha’s voice, the way the trace of a memory sounds charged with something she can’t describe, a heavy weight of the love little Agatha didn’t get. </p><p> </p><p>“She was ‘Aunt Lilia’ to me back then,” Agatha explains. Rio nods, sharing her focus, clearly listening, but never suffocating. </p><p> </p><p>“She gifted me a pack of tarot cards for my 7th birthday, she said it would bring me great power,” a ghost of a smile comes over Agatha’s features remembering the older woman’s dramatics, how she’d speak with such practiced gusto, a performance. Agatha could never tell if it was part of the joy she’d sewn through interactions with small children or was just how Sister Calderu was all the time. </p><p> </p><p>“Evanora allowed witchcraft in her blessed home?” Rio asks, genuine curiosity, the truth of it breaking the tension of it, before Agatha can even get to the story. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sobers, but shakes her head. </p><p> </p><p>“Lilia told me not to tell her, to keep it as our secret.” Rio seems to buffer at the answer, perhaps coming to terms with how long Agatha had been dealing with Evanora’s wrath, how her childhood had been soaked in tense anger, riddled with stark judgement with no choice but to fall in line. And still, that maybe Lilia knew about it, an adult with more power than Rio, knew to some degree the monster that little Agatha faced in her own home, and still couldn’t do enough to save her. </p><p> </p><p>“Anyway,” Agatha breathes, “One night, after my mother was asleep, Lilia gave me a reading, past, present, and future.”</p><p> </p><p>”My present was the death card,” Agatha laughs like it’s funny. Rio looks at her like she’s insane (maybe a truth that she already knows).</p><p> </p><p>”And that’s funny?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head. ”I’m remembering Lilia’s face when she realized she just traumatized a seven year old who thought she’d just received a terminal diagnosis.”</p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t the death card like rebirth too?” Rio starts to puzzle out, still trying to parse how the story has to do with her original question. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods. </p><p> </p><p>“The image on the card was Death personified, a figure in a green cloak with a scythe stood in a field of azaleas. She explained that they represent the cycle of life and new beginnings.”</p><p> </p><p>”Hope,” Rio adds, looking at Agatha, swimming in the gift of her vulnerability, letting the full weight of it hit home.</p><p> </p><p>”Yeah,” Agatha voices softly, a chirp of a word barely spoken, her eyes trained on the pale purple petals. A world of despair to explore in all the things she wasn’t saying. Rio couldn’t ask about what the abuse looked like back then, couldn’t bear to think of Agatha so small and alone. </p><p> </p><p>”Why isn’t she ‘Aunt Lilia’ anymore?” Rio asks, not being able to quiet the wonder, a small part of her wanting to take advantage of how open Agatha was being right now.</p><p> </p><p>”She got too close,” Agatha still doesn’t look at her, the answer floating out like it's simple, pulling her gloves off suddenly feeling too hot, not enough room to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hopes Rio can fill in the blanks, that Lilia started to figure out Evanora’s cruelty, that her mother pushed the nun out of their lives before she could find any solid truth. She doesn’t know if she’d be able to explain how her mother had ripped away the only person who made her feel special. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands shake, a hesitation in knowing what’s allowed, wondering if Agatha wants to be touched, wants to be comforted. The sound of voices, close but a barrier of greenery and blushing winds keeping them separate, surges in like they’d suddenly been dropped back into reality. </p><p> </p><p>Rio brushes away the tear on Agatha’s cheek before it can make its full descent, before Agatha truly knows its falling, letting the certainty of the gesture push through them. Blue eyes meet brown ones once again. Rio’s hand doesn’t leave her cheek.</p><p>They can’t be bothered by the course grime of dirt Rio’s hands track onto her face, too tethered by this bold need for something to feel.</p><p> </p><p>It aches like a collapse, a sore twist of finding the North Star when they’ve felt irreconcilably lost for ages, if only they can learn to use it as a means of navigation. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at Agatha’s lips. A fleeting glimpse that she can’t erase, before brown eyes tumble closed, sacred and forlorn. Agatha shakes at the show of leaden exhaustion.</p><p> </p><p>She grabs at Rio’s wrist, her fingers pressing over pulsing veins, soothing skin with her own. </p><p> </p><p>In the clear burden of her own pain, the way it stretches out from her tongue, lays the weight on Rio’s shoulders, the voice that rings of the ghosts of the past, the way she sees it now reflected in Rio’s eyes, it still feels good to share it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio holds it like it is holy, a shared piece of salvation. The body of Christ broken up into small pieces, disbursed and eaten like communion to be received.</p><p> </p><p>Amen. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha thought that trying on prom dresses would feel like being soaked in expensive perfume, cloaked in royal garb, a taste of luxury life had never afforded her. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora had bought her nice clothes, enough plain sweaters and church appropriate slacks to keep anyone from questioning if she was properly clothed. But there was never anything that went past a necessity, Agatha having to cement her style in cautiously conservative looks that were neat and just on the edge of elegant. </p><p> </p><p>Instead, it feels like something she shouldn’t care about, shouldn’t be putting pressure on. A few weeks ago, prom wasn’t even in her vocabulary, an event she hadn’t planned for, easier to never contemplate it if she knew her mother would never let her go.</p><p> </p><p>But now, she’s in a changing room at a tiny store in the mall, the lighting feels too bright, the bustling of people outside the thin door. Rio had picked her out a few options, the overwhelm in blue eyes evident when presented with all the different styles and colors. Being deprived of this until now, made her feel small, about to graduate high school with no sense of what kind of clothing she liked, what looked good on her. </p><p> </p><p>There’s a knock on the other side of the door, she’d locked it behind her without a second thought, craving the safety of solitude when her face grew red from frustration.</p><p> </p><p>”I have one more,” Rio says delicately against the wood panel, a request for Agatha to open the door. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches for the lock without hesitation, needing Rio’s presence to fill the small space, knowing it will quiet the rage in her heart. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes are tracked downward as the door swings open, assuming that Agatha might be in some state of undress, wanting to give her some privacy, not wanting to overstep.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha is still fully clothed, clad in athletic pants and a long sleeve shirt, shoes still tied. Rio seems to read the silent hesitation, reaches for a course of action as she hangs a third dress on the hook by the door. </p><p> </p><p>Rio never asks ‘are you okay?’ She knows Agatha will lie, will press against her own wounds. She doesn’t communicate that way. If Agatha wants to say something, she’ll start the conversation. Rio asks actionable questions, finds the knot in Agatha’s mind and untangles it without a trace.</p><p> </p><p>”You didn’t pick any out for yourself?” Agatha asks, letting the fire of her usual banter sink into it even if the words aren’t cutting, needs to feel like this is normal.</p><p> </p><p>”I thought you might need help zipping up, we can look for me after”</p><p> </p><p>”Oh”</p><p> </p><p>A beat of silence. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches for the hem of her shirt, lifting it over her head without a warning.</p><p> </p><p>Rio instantly swivels her body around, snapping her eyes to the wall like a rubber band, not knowing where the boundary is. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snickers to herself continuing to undress, she can see the blush creeping up the back of Rio’s neck, sees the way she shakes her head to herself, the other girl trying to rid her mind from whatever indecent thoughts take hold. </p><p> </p><p>“That good, huh?” Agatha teases as she comes over to grab the first dress, assess the mess of tulle and seams, still angling to call Rio’s actions out, sinking back into their ease just as abruptly as she’d been ripped out of it. </p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t see anything,” Rio huffs like she’s disappointed in that truth, her forehead thudding against the closest wall. </p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to sound so sad about it,” Agatha whispers into Rio’s ear, changing her course of action to wrap her bare arms around Rio, keep her solidly in her hold facing the wall. </p><p> </p><p>It isn’t that scandalous, Agatha still in her bra and underwear, Rio still fully clothed, but Rio’s breath hitches all the same, the unexpected softness of Agatha’s voice so close, her breath tickling her ear, the way her chin rests on her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Neither of them is sure where the boldness is coming from, unclear on where old boundaries ceased and new ones bloomed. She presses a few kisses into Rio’s neck, spurred on by the desire in her gut, pushing away the fear that making new boundaries would undo them, feeling from Rio’s breathing, the awed silence that the attention wasn’t unwelcome.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes fall shut, focusing on the feel of soft lips on her skin, basking in the quiet ease of surrendering. </p><p> </p><p>“You can turn around,” Agatha grants permission, guiding them swiftly, it makes her feel powerful, willing them forward towards something new, Rio malleable to her commands.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns then, free from Agatha’s arms, they are close, but no contact being made. </p><p> </p><p>A question dancing in brown eyes, seeking. Agatha can see the thirst churning in her face, searching for truth. Her eyes refuse to leave Agatha’s face without it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha licks her lips, traps her own bottom lip between her teeth, grabbing onto Rio’s hands, pressing the girl’s palms against her hips, pleading for brown irises to explore, to see her, to touch her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands hold solidly, grasping against jutting hip bones, scratching against her lower back, finding fluid ridges and soft skin, her eyes finally fall, the blush springing to her cheeks at the sight of Agatha’s baby pink bra, a charged innocence in contrast to the way blue eyes were pleading with her. </p><p> </p><p>There is too much to register, too much new to explore. The flurry of birthmarks on Agatha’s chest and shoulders, a dazzling constellation of barely visible freckles, the sharp push of her collarbones, the swell of cleavage never this free for Rio’s eyes, the balanced curve of her frame, her throat free from any shirt collars, just the solid edge of her breathing, the steady pulse that reminded Rio that time was still moving forward.  </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands come off of Rio’s wrists when she feels confident that the brunette will stay there, her grip tightening slightly, her thumbs rubbing over the material of her underwear. Instead, Agatha’s hands reach for Rio’s face, supporting her head like she’d hold it up forever, guiding Rio’s eyes back up, centering Rio back. </p><p> </p><p>“Help me put the dress on?” Agatha tilts her face up to speak right into Rio’s, her hands still anchored along her jawline, her eyebrows lift, like a question she already has an answer to, a king commanding his army. </p><p> </p><p>Rio folds, because she has no choice, the involuntarily nod taking course without any hesitation, playing into Agatha’s trap and loving every second of it. </p><p> </p><p>The moment isn’t broken as Agatha takes Rio’s hand as she pulls out of the embrace, bringing them the step and a half it takes to be in front of the dresses again. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs at the zipper, pushing down with no movement, groaning at the way the material doesn’t swoop to the pressure of her hands, wondering where her powers vanished to, the same hands that had worked on Rio now rendered useless. </p><p> </p><p>“The zippers are awful,” Rio chuckles at Agatha’s feeble attempt nudging Agatha aside and taking charge, she pulls against another seam, shimmies the zipper and unzips it like she’s a fucking dress whisperer. </p><p> </p><p>The display of ease is infuriating. If Agatha sweats a little at the sight of Rio’s diligent hands, then that’s her business, and her business alone. </p><p> </p><p>Rio helps her step into the gown, Agatha trying to focus on not tripping instead of the way brown eyes trace over her thighs. </p><p> </p><p>Fuck, they haven’t even kissed yet. But she wants-</p><p> </p><p>God. She wants Rio to-</p><p> </p><p>Okay. Maybe losing her virginity in a fucking fitting room wasn’t the plan, but neither was Rio liking her back, wanting her back. And okay, Rio definitely looked like she wanted her. </p><p> </p><p>Shit-  </p><p> </p><p>It reminds her of all the times Rio had covered bruises with careful brushes of concealer, the closeness shared in bathrooms for years of friendship that never travelled over carefully laid lines, breathing the same air but never giving it a name.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reminds herself to breathe, helps Rio pull up the fabric around her, pushes away the new wave of thoughts as warm fingers settle over her spine, as Rio zips up the dress. </p><p> </p><p>Finding herself in the mirror, Agatha’s eyes trace the v-shaped neckline, the light blue satin that falls against her frame like a coated delicacy. She doesn’t hate it, a complex parade of emotions struggling to find somewhere to land. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes move over her, her hand playing with the skirt of the dress, messing with the way the fabric hangs, making sure it’s even on both sides.</p><p> </p><p>”I don’t know if this color is really you,” Rio says and it’s true, no eager compliment coming to her lips even if Agatha can see the hunger in brown irises, the way Rio seems to swallow harder. </p><p> </p><p>“Then why’d you pick it?” Agatha scowls like it's a setup, a friendly prank being pulled. </p><p> </p><p>“Thought you deserved to feel like a princess,” Rio smirks, no joke in her tone, looking at Agatha through the mirror like she was made of diamonds, “This was the closest I could find to Cinderella blue.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to punch her, wanted to push her into the wall and fight away all the good swirling in her, all the ugly things snuffed out by the way Rio looked at her, held her emotions with enough grace to let Agatha heal. Rio wasn’t trying to fix her, knew Agatha had to do the work herself to know her own beauty, to find her own sense of purpose, but Rio would always be solid ground, a place to rest when growth felt like failure, a reminder that she was never alone, someone that would hold her worth while Agatha fought to find it for herself. </p><p> </p><p>“I thought nerds like you preferred Belle,” Agatha voices instead, digging into that warm feeling, rubbing out the soreness of it, truly feeling the pain. </p><p> </p><p>“Pffft, have you seen Jasmine?” Rio offers quickly. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, holding back her own smile, her posture shifting into something more natural, the poise and confidence coming back in. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re such a child,” Agatha finally lets herself smile, grabbing onto Rio’s shoulders pulling her closer like a slow dance, Rio’s hands finding her hips again like it’s not the second time.</p><p> </p><p>”You’re just jealous you don’t get to ride on my magic carpet.”</p><p> </p><p>Fuck, Rio. Fuck, she wants to f-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushes her away, her hand pushes against the side of Rio’s face, laughing at the way brown eyes widen as she tries to hold onto Agatha, a conscious effort to stay on her feet without ripping the dress as Agatha swats at her like a cat. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Revelations 21:4- He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha got to choose. </p><p> </p><p>She kept reminding herself. </p><p> </p><p>Reminding herself that Rio wasn’t going to push her, that for all the new discoveries, the way Rio looked at her now that she knew…</p><p> </p><p>It still felt like she was waiting for the right time to start. To stop procrastinating them. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t some enlightened revelation, a cursed epiphany, a tragic daydream. She knew the perfect moment wasn’t coming. She still sort of hoped that the courage would warp over her suddenly, a boomerang of power that would send them both reeling. She couldn’t decide what would be worse- something spur of the moment, or a curated plan.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t erase the way it raced through her mind whenever they were alone, how it had always felt like a missed opportunity lately.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha should have kissed Rio in the dressing room, or in the church bathroom over a week ago, or 3 years ago when she stopped pretending the feelings weren’t real, she should have kissed her everytime Agatha sat on the sink at school, pull Rio closer, kiss her without fear and ask for forgiveness later.</p><p> </p><p>It felt like lost time, a crushed reality that collapsed and pulsed under the pressure, never holding firm against the torment of gilded possibilities. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you remember what Cassiopeia looks like?” Rio’s voice is dulled while asking about the constellation, something adjacent to a mumble, the tone of it shifting when the night creeps in, the unconscious lull that sways away the diction of her syllables.</p><p> </p><p>They’re sat on Rio’s balcony, the calm breeze swaying the trees around the house, the sun gone for some time. Rio had tried to convince Agatha to let her take her home after the mall, not wanting Evanora’s wrath to creep up on them while their guards were down.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swatted at her, pouted with all her energy, blackmailed Rio into turning the car around. She didn’t want to let go, step back, create any space between them. And Agatha was willing to take the risk of staying out past curfew, was willing to test the limits of the new dynamic her mother seemed to be shifting into. </p><p> </p><p>Her skin was forgetting what it was to be healing, her fingers remembering how to remain steady.</p><p> </p><p>Because this new reality felt strange, a life where her mother paid less attention was better than one where she was overbearing and violent. But she couldn’t ask her why she’d been hovering less, why she’d given Agatha her credit card and the permission to find some semblance of freedom. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s like a squiggle,” Agatha answers, her head tucked into Rio’s shoulder, a light blanket thrown over them. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s sat up against the siding of the house, her posture sagging forward, Agatha’s frame melted against her, close enough to whisper. Agatha lifts her head a bit, her eyes shifted against the night sky, trying to find the constellation, testing her own answer. </p><p> </p><p>“There,” Agatha points, her eyes moving to check if Rio was looking where she was indicating, a desire to make Rio proud, prove to her that she’d been listening anytime she divulged her knowledge about the stars. </p><p> </p><p>“Hmm” Rio nods slightly, a small smile poking through the tired resolve. </p><p> </p><p>“How does one get a constellation named after them?” Agatha ponders, her hand finding a new home on Rio’s knee, stroking slightly, willing Rio to speak, wanting to hear her voice. </p><p> </p><p>“Be an awful person aka dramatic mythological shit,” Rio offers.</p><p> </p><p>”So I’m halfway there,” Agatha ribs herself.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s fingers jut into her rib cage causing her to yelp, a movement that went against the exhaustion that took over the rest of her body, a clear punishment for Agatha’s words. Rio’s hand settles against her side, pulls her in tighter, rubbing away the discomfort, willing the tense energy out. </p><p> </p><p>“Cassiopeia boasted about being more beautiful than sea nymphs,” Rio explains.</p><p> </p><p>”Sea nymphs?”</p><p> </p><p>”I didn’t make this shit up,” Rio defends herself.</p><p> </p><p>“But it’s seared into your giant brain for some reason”</p><p> </p><p>”Do you wanna hear the story or not?” Rio looks at her, waiting for the combative energy to dissipate.</p><p> </p><p>”Go on.” </p><p> </p><p>“Anyway,” Rio sighs, Agatha loving the way her body moved with it, “Poseidon was like ‘you got me fucked up, you can’t talk shit about the sea nymphs’. To try to save their city from him, Cassiopeia and her husband decide to sacrifice their daughter, Andromeda. They chain her to a rock and leave her to be killed by a sea monster, Cetus.” </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, yeah. Awful people.” Agatha agrees with Rio’s earlier explanation. “Poor Andromeda.”</p><p> </p><p>”She gets saved by Perseus, a monster slayer and they get married.”</p><p> </p><p>”Ew, God forbid a girl goes unwed.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think feminism was at the forefront, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>”So, Cassiopeia never got punished?” Comes the soft question, a gauge for what comes next. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s her punishment,” Rio tries to explain, nudging her head towards the sky, “Poseidon doomed her to eternity in the sky, chained to a rock the same way she left her daughter.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets the words sink in, takes the time to feel Rio’s words, the vibration pressed into her skin. </p><p> </p><p>The prison in the sky, the stars marking out the chain.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t want to lock away the feelings forever, doesn’t want to be condemned to forever without taking the chance. Facing the triumphs of the unknown has always felt like a constellation she couldn’t reach, but Rio is her telescope. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha gets to choose. </p><p> </p><p>She turns her head, finding the glint in Rio’s eyes in the dark, the streetlights and stars giving them enough light to see each other, for Agatha to find the tactful wonder in Rio’s eyes, the soft smile on her lips as she sinks further into her. </p><p> </p><p>She slides closer, angles in, her hand grasping at the side of Rio’s neck, feels her pulse against her fingertips. She lets her eyes find the curve of Rio’s lips, grounds herself in the way the arms around her hold firm, keep her safe, rid her of any desire to stop herself. </p><p> </p><p>It makes her feel powerful, the magnetism she finds here, so close, the power to create their story, define their reality. In a life she’s been granted no control, she’s ready to make her own. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sinks forward, feeling the flex of Rio’s fingertips on her lower back as their lips finally meet. </p><p> </p><p>It isn’t a hurried crash, no fatal explosions. Agatha shakes at the ease of it, a promise that taking the leap was worth it. </p><p> </p><p>It’s soft and slow, Rio pushing in to guide them, exploring the feeling of finality. Agatha wasn’t running from this, a quiet plea that leaves her mouth as a whimper. </p><p> </p><p>It’s an outpouring of precious joy, a shattering pressure that roars like a fire. Agatha’s hand finds a better angle, pulls Rio in by the back of her neck, scratches at her nape. Rio hands stroke up her back, humbling herself to the girl in front of her, willing herself to not tremble under the weight.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries to focus on all of it, the way their breathing syncs, the deep rise and fall of chests, the suffocating warmth of Rio’s hands on her, the blanket suddenly feeling like too much, the intricate tangle of their limbs, the smooth brush of lips, the repeated motion like the practice of a prayer, something new to find in every new press of connection.</p><p> </p><p>Rio latches onto her bottom lip, slowing the motion to breathe her in, allowing the rocking pattern of devouring to settle back towards storming static. Agatha can feel the blood rushing through her head, the fluttering in her stomach, a pressure in her gut that overwhelms her into taking back control. </p><p> </p><p>She pushes forward, continuing the kiss intently, caressing Rio’s head with the strength to not let it hit the wall behind them, locking her in to the new angle, feeling all Rio’s control leave her body, her resolve breaking, giving in. </p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I can’t believe this is chapter 8…that’s a big number for Elmo</p><p>Thank you for any input about Agatha’s and Rio’s birthdays…I think right now I’ve decided to not use them anytime soon but thinking on it more…I do think Agatha is a Leo (as a Leo I can agree that we’re dramatic fucks performing through our deep pain and yearning).but bestie brought up Agatha having like a January bday…which made me think she’d have like a Christmas adjacent bday that gets glossed over. Idk. I was going back and forth with Rio being either a Scorpio or a Libra (maybe Scorpio is rising idk she’s just a fucking weirdo but she’s def not as chaotic in this fic) but libra feels right for this characterization of her like the air sign being social and good at communicating, she’s charming and smart and like seeking balance (LIKE DEATH: THE NATURAL ORDER OF ALL THINGS BABY)</p><p>New question:: what are your thoughts on the masculine/feminine characterizations of Agatha and Rio in fic compared to canon portrayal??? I have lots of thoughts on it lol</p></blockquote>

<p>1 Corinthians 10:13- No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.</p><p> </p><p>Lunch had been Agatha’s favorite class for a long time, the soaring conversations that allowed her to sink back into comfort, the guise of invisible that cloaked her in safety, too many students in the cafeteria to focus just on her, where she could decompress slightly from the terse expectations of raising her hand in class, offering answers that never teetered too close to problematic, a mask she could lower slightly.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio had always been a factor too. Their bare knees knocking together under the table, the way Rio was within reach, wordlessly sharing her lunch with her, a conversation they’d never really explored, just the shared reality that Evanora didn’t keep enough groceries stocked for Agatha to pack her own lunch, never opted her daughter into the opportunity for soggy cafeteria pizza or gray chicken nuggets. Instead, Rio would lay out a sandwich bag of baby carrots or an extra lunchables (even if she’d always steal the Oreo out of Agatha’s).</p><p> </p><p>It felt like a cozy place to nap, a debrief on which nuns were being crazy, in depth debates about Zodiac signs, an update on the latest Catholic school gossip. A definite 45-minute period where they got to be kids, the weight of life suspended long enough to munch on celery sticks filled with peanut butter or whatever protein-deficient thing Rio had deemed suitable to fuel their growing minds. </p><p> </p><p>Today, it was something else. </p><p> </p><p>Rio still close, still caring, still unwavering.</p><p> </p><p>But they weren’t in the cafeteria. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat on the bathroom sink, something familiar in the way the porcelain jutted into the back of her thighs, the bars on the window, the offensive smell of Lysol inescapable. </p><p> </p><p>The bathroom that they’d used on so many occasions before, mornings spent with Rio blending concealer over raging bruises, stood in Agatha’s personal space, had cared for her with delicate hands and solemn eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Rio still stood between her thighs, but her makeup bag was still tucked in her book bag, no need for the practiced precision of beauty blenders and blue eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can feel her own heartbeat, a thrumming pulse against her spine, a disjointed pressure at the way Rio’s hands grasp at her hips, the firm press of Rio’s breaths as they kiss, the solid push of Rio close enough to hold, to pull closer, to lose herself in the stubborn heat. </p><p> </p><p>It was intoxicating, running her fingers through her hair, the feel of her thumbs pressing into her pelvis, the way she seemed to fit between her thighs like a dangerous magnet, her skirt pushed up enough for the cool air to make her shiver, her mouth warm and insatiable. </p><p> </p><p>And maybe Rio was addicted too, pulling Agatha up the stairs to their designated bathroom, looking at her with a blooming surge of desire, a gaze that Agatha couldn’t laugh at, something serious and certain in the way Rio had lifted her onto the sink, took up Agatha’s space without thought.</p><p> </p><p>As dominant as she had been during their first kiss, Agatha wasn’t going to complain about Rio taking the reins, happy to be put in her place, the switch of control running parallel to their always shifting dynamics, the antagonizer and the victim. </p><p> </p><p>That raw hunger in the way Rio kissed her, like she was afraid Agatha might be taken from her, thrown into a high tower never to be seen again. It lit up parts of her body that she’d never paid much attention to before.</p><p> </p><p>There had always been the accelerated heart rate, the ache in her stomach. But now there was a slight tremble, the way her hands couldn’t stay still, scratching at her scalp, or gripping at her shoulders, her legs felt heavy, perhaps an unconscious desire to never move away from the present. The goosebumps on her arms contrasted with the warm knot in her gut, the growing ache to explore, to be explored. She could feel her nipples pressing hard into the inside of her bra as Rio’s hands trailed up her rib cage, the way her mouth morphed against Rio’s lips, a chase to a finish line she couldn’t see, was content to exist in the race even if she couldn’t win.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs at Rio’s tie (an optional part of their uniform that Rio often opted for) her thumb high enough to press against her throat as she tugged her in, the hiccup of a whimper crossing from Rio’s lips to Agatha’s. It only causes Rio to have to tilt her head more, the space between them changing shape slightly, Rio’s hands finding stability on Agatha’s thighs. Her hands don’t waiver, stroking against the soft expanse of skin, a new alarm bell awoken between Agatha’s legs. Rio isn’t quite thinking of all the implications, keeping herself upright, letting Agatha choke her slightly, not wanting to break the kiss. </p><p> </p><p>Her fingers slide forward underneath fabric, one hand scratching over the top of her thigh, the other snaking under, grabbing a handful of the back of the other. It makes Agatha’s breath hitch, an empty plea for something that Rio can’t undo, her brain locked into the way each touch affects the rhythm, the ability to breathe. </p><p> </p><p>They hadn’t laid out rules, hadn’t talked about boundaries. It had felt like an avalanche since Agatha took the initial leap, since Agatha had kissed her 3 days prior on Rio’s balcony, since Rio drove Agatha home in the dark, kissed her goodnight, since Evanora didn’t say anything about missing curfew, still hadn’t raised a fist at her. Since then, it had felt like a river pouring into the ocean, a faucet set to drip suddenly given permission to be turned all the way open. </p><p> </p><p>And of course, the last few days had only afforded them so much time, a crushed timeline of trying to decide when they could afford to kiss. Missing lunch was worth it if it meant they were doing this instead. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands move again, the movement feeling secondary to the way Rio is still kissing her, the way Agatha is still in control in that regard, but Rio’s hands are in charge a few feet below, lifting slightly higher until her fingertips press into the edge of Agatha’s underwear.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingertips dance over the seam, a barely there touch, a tease of something Agatha can’t process, the idea of it punching the breath out of her, the uncertainty suddenly reminding her of where they are, of why she isn’t ready for that.</p><p> </p><p>”Rio,” Agatha practically gasps her name into her mouth, pushing back against Rio’s sternum just enough to put an inch between their mouths. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” Rio’s hands retract from under her skirt, petrified that she might have crossed a line, her brown eyes glow with restraint and lust, something between needy and satisfied. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes Rio’s wrists when she sees the hesitation spark in brown eyes, guides her hands back to her hips over her skirt, tries to reassure her without words, tell her it wasn’t rejection, just a buffer for now.</p><p> </p><p>She lifts one hand to wrap loosely around Rio’s neck, firm enough to feel the drumming of her pulse, ground her back to the sharp epiphany of new territory.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilts her head up, a smug smirk playing on her lips, her eyes shifting from Agatha’s eyes to her lips and back again. It feels like a power play, a gaze that says ‘You want me, don’t you?’ No question in it, just the knowledge that Rio could sense the desire rippling off the girl she held in her hands, could feel the need like it was tangible. She was gloating. Showboating. Like Agatha’s want was a prize she won at the state fair, a giant stuffed animal she’d proudly carry on the Ferris wheel. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wants to kill her.</p><p> </p><p>But she’ll settle for pressing more firmly around her neck for now, depriving her of enough air for a fraction of a second. </p><p> </p><p>Only the punishment doesn’t have the intended effect. Well, it gets the job done in wiping that goofy smirk off her face, but it also causes Rio’s knees to shake, sinks her closer toward Agatha’s lips again, like the pressure of Agatha’s hand didn’t erase the truth of Agatha’s untamed desires, but it reminded Rio of her own.</p><p> </p><p>”You like being choked?” Agatha whispers conspiratorially into the waning space between their faces, flexing her fingers again in an attempt to test her own theory.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t answer with words, her eyebrows flexing lower into something pained and delicious as she reconnects their lips, less thunder and drive, a pace that soars less like a blazing fire, languid and charged. She bites at Agatha’s bottom lip, a scratch of teeth that has Agatha’s hand holding firmer around her throat, a small noise bleeding out between them as they exist in their new game, figuring out all the little things that set each other on fire. </p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls away again, determined to set a new course, she pulls Agatha’s wrist back, a force that stops the choking lazily, opens new windows to explore. She cradles Agatha’s neck for a moment, fingertips ghosting over the side intently, no mischief in her eyes, only love, only wonder. Agatha only contemplates being choked back for a half a second before Rio is angling her back instead, pressing her lips to Agatha’s jawline with a soft caution that rivals the way she pushes forward, like she is sure of her own wishes, to show Agatha affection, to cover her in the surplus of it, but unsure of where Agatha will allow them to step.</p><p> </p><p>The soft pecks slide lower against her neck, below her ear, finding her pulse, the spaces of tendon and muscle that draw out whines, the weight of her lips harsher against the soft skin, her teeth coming out to bite gently.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know if it would be enough to leave a mark, but the idea of Rio staking claim to her that way made her feel weightless, like a floating orb that Rio would cast protection spells over, would curse anyone that dared looked at her wrong, would kiss like a fragile ornament to be savored and enjoyed. </p><p> </p><p>Her hand snakes up to the back of Rio’s head, holds her there, her warm mouth waltzing over her throat to the other size, a twisted game of too much and too little, threading her fingers through her hair once more.</p><p> </p><p>“Baby,” the flushed whine comes out of her mouth before she can question it, something they’d never called each other, that slips from her mind like a practiced reality where this has felt like a fated possibility for years.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can feel her own blush as Rio chuckles slightly into her neck, a blink of a second where that careful lust morphs back into that self-satisfied smirk, before Rio’s lips return to their previous task, assaulting her neck with nips and kisses. </p><p> </p><p>The heat of it punches her in the gut, annoyed at the way Rio’s stupidity turns her on just as much as the brushes of sharp teeth. She’s too aware of her breathing, the rise and fall of her chest, the merciless dedication Rio has to making her head spin. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hears it first, Rio busy in her world of quaking heartbeats and listening to the shrill chorus of tainted breathing, focused on Agatha and only Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>She thinks it’s nothing at first, the old air conditioner flickering on, the displacement of air, but the gush of it sharpens against the bathroom door swinging open. A torturous moment where eye contact is made, blue eyes meeting green, a lapse of time long enough to register.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t mean to yank at Rio’s hair, doesn’t recall stepping down from the sink, finding shaky feet, but she’s unsure of exactly how the push culminated, the split second of getting Rio off of her in the past now, left in a stagnant present of Agatha, Rio, and Wanda standing in the third floor bathroom of their all-girls Catholic school when it was very clear what Agatha and Rio were doing, was very clear that Wanda witnessed a piece of it. </p><p> </p><p>The collapsing silence shrinks Agatha into her blasphemous anxiety, an echo of possibilities where she can’t wrap her mind around what might come of Wanda witnessing homosexuality, leaving a crooked understanding of the way the girl stood still, staring wide-eyed, the way Rio was clearly still trying to process, still trying to breathe evenly. </p><p> </p><p>Rio clears her throat, grabs at her own tie in an attempt to self-soothe, straightening it as she prepares herself to speak.</p><p> </p><p>"We're like the Spider-Man meme,” Rio offers like it’s time to joke, a way to break the tension, she lifts both hands to point a finger toward each of them like she needed to show them what she meant, complete the joke like a willful performance. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” Wanda’s lips curl slightly, a trace of a smile, shame or astonishment Agatha can’t tell, shaking her head like her thoughts had suddenly returned, “I didn’t mean to interrupt.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t help but notice that the words seem more directed at Rio, Wanda’s eyes ghosting over her like an afterthought.</p><p> </p><p>”it’s okay, we were just about to go,” Rio nods, pressing out that good-natured empathy that always poured out of her like it was limitless, seemingly looking for an out that didn’t spill into confrontation.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda trains her eyes to the floor, seals herself with a steadying breath, doesn’t look at Agatha as Rio grabs her bag for her from the floor, presses the strap into Agatha’s hands.</p><p> </p><p>”C’mon” Rio whispers just for her, trying to coax her out of the spell, stopping her from looking at Wanda any longer, stopping her from puzzling out what she might be thinking right now. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” Wanda smiles, “Again.” She sort of chuckles as they pass, something real in the apology even if coated in that unreadable strangeness that often came with interactions with Wanda. </p><p> </p><p>“it’s really okay,” Rio assures her, returning the smile, holding tight to Agatha’s wrist as they leave. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m surprised she didn’t stone us,” Agatha grumbles, snatching her wrist out of Rio’s touch, needing to cross her arms in indignation, wanting to feel the full press of annoyance that Wanda had ruined the moment, stopping Rio from having her way with her. </p><p> </p><p>The bell rings before Rio can begin to formulate a rebuttal. </p><p> </p><p>Lunch period over. Agatha has pre-calculus. Rio has art. A strain of separation for 45 whole minutes. Agatha huffs before she can think to hold it in. </p><p> </p><p>The hallway starts to fill with students and nuns, Agatha looks at Rio like her own apology, like they needed alone time that wasn’t in dusty bathrooms, that deserved a place that wasn’t always tarnished with the chance of being interrupted, like they needed to talk about it, say the things that had left them wrecked and vulnerable, teach each other the new lines that could and couldn’t be crossed. But the words don’t leave her mouth. It doesn’t feel like enough. </p><p> </p><p>“Here,” Rio pulls a packet out of her book bag, holds it out toward Agatha. Goldfish crackers. “So you don’t starve.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, her heart picking back up at the constant stream of care, a friendship (something more now) that sort of felt like being mothered sometimes, it made her want to vomit, the extent that Rio cared about her, showed it in her actions, never let Agatha question it. She snatches the offered bag from Rio’s hand, watching the light smile from it reach brown eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“Life would be a lot easier, if you just let me starve to death,” Agatha voices like an unbridled truth, letting the chaos of the crowd around them push her closer toward Rio, not caring that her pre-calc class was on the other side of the building and she was probably making herself late. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, baby,” Rio’s face turns sad, a mask of devastation that Agatha knew was a jovial ploy (the words still get her, reel her in closer), “If you die, I’ll have no one to annoy.”</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p>Galatians 5:19-21- The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha strolls into pre-calculus right before the bell rings, effectively on-time. She still rushes to throw out the now empty packet of goldfish crackers and make her way to her seat. </p><p> </p><p>“You okay?” Jen whispers from the desk beside her as she settles in.</p><p> </p><p>”Yeah,” Agatha chimes back, wondering if Jen could see in her face that she’d just been making out with Rio for the better half of the last hour, she shifts her hair, chastising herself for not checking for any marks possibly left on her neck, “Why wouldn’t I be?”</p><p> </p><p>Sister Abigail starts writing some formula on the board, Agatha hopes its enough to lean them towards an end of this conversation.</p><p> </p><p>”You and Rio weren’t at lunch,” Jen supplies her reasoning.</p><p> </p><p>Oh. Duh. </p><p> </p><p>Jennifer Kale wasn’t a mind reader. No billowing indications that she knew anything other than the reality of their absence from the cafeteria.</p><p> </p><p>”Rio’s such a nerd,” Agatha rolls her eyes, using her dramatics to sell the story, “She wanted to study in the library.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s a half truth. Rio is a nerd. Someone who played word games for fun. Carried a pocket sudoku book in her backpack. Actually enjoyed learning. Ew. </p><p> </p><p>But Agatha can’t push away the part of her that kind of admires that. That Rio’s eyes light up during an impromptu ‘TED talk’ hosted in her living room, that she was dedicated to understanding how things worked, was kind enough to share her knowledge with the world around her. If anything it paralleled the way she seemed to exist with care for everything and everyone, like Newton’s laws of motion deserved the same amount of attention as Hamlet, like people could be cared for and praised like cult classics and paintings hung in museums. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was happy to see Jen start taking notes, seemingly accepting her answer without further questions. </p><p> </p><p>She tried to focus. Tried to zone in on the writing on the board, copying down the Pythagorean Theorem for the millionth time and inputting the numbers. But Rio was still on her mind, the ease with which they’d slid into all this newness, the way she made it feel safe to exist in the change, to figure it out in careful missteps. </p><p> </p><p>It felt like a tidal wave, the new course of the last few weeks of her life, where the tortured angst had melted into this molten desire that she could finally act on, a tragic yearning that taught her of her own strength, reminded her that she had power too. </p><p> </p><p>Coupled with this mountain of feeling, the way kissing Rio, touching her skin as more than a friend, flirting with her, crested a storm of emotion that sort of felt like an assault, her heart soaring, her gut tightening, the anxiety releasing in a way she hadn’t felt before. </p><p> </p><p>Kissing Ralph had been like eating wet paper. An experience that had her questioning if intimacy was something she even wanted. </p><p> </p><p>But kissing Rio, fuck even just being in her space, felt like watching azaleas bloom, like sharing popcorn and a blanket, the pitter patter of rain, like settling into a hammock and never doubting its ability to support her weight. </p><p> </p><p>It feels like a unfurling web of all the memories they’d shared, the sour taste that hung around the edges of every time Agatha had wanted to kiss her, to confess, was now blistered with tender orchids, now it felt like a clear path towards something she could hold, something she could cherish. </p><p> </p><p>It kind of made her grateful for Evanora. Or at least grateful for the sudden cease fire that she still couldn’t fully wrap her mind around. The wicked press of violence suddenly retracted, words that stung with the way Agatha was surprised by her mother’s indifference. It was startling that Evanora didn’t even have to dance into kindness and it was still refreshing. </p><p> </p><p>Whatever it was, it gave her a second to breathe, a moment to remember herself beyond survival, take a leap towards Rio without running away, without crinkling back into precision folded origami, stoic and broken, and unwilling to change shape. </p><p> </p><p>Her brain still rushes toward a practice of being thankful to God, a pattern yielded from the countless amounts of lectures and worksheets on praising Him in all circumstances, a call to an action she’d be force-fed over and over since birth.</p><p> </p><p>The dissonance of it still burned, the pulling away from an identity that felt like safety for so much of her childhood, echoed like a fictional tale of attentive parents and unconditional love. </p><p> </p><p>The only truth to that felt like Rio. Steadfast. Never deterred by Agatha’s sharp words or hesitance to be vulnerable. </p><p> </p><p>She’s taken out of her thoughts as Sister Abigail stops mid sentence about using cosine on a calculator. Agatha follows the teacher’s eyeline to find the cause for interruption. Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. Well, Vice Principal Valentina Allegra de Fontaine if Agatha’s really trying to boost the word count for the obituary.</p><p> </p><p>Valentina waltzes in like a smooth politician, the confident stride of a wasp perched to wreak havoc. One of Evanora’s puppets strung around to do her bidding, but more than that Valentina was conniving and charming in her own right, a personality that Agatha was surprised was comfortable sitting as second in command. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallows in fear before she even knows the cause for intrusion, knowing Valentina did everything with calculated purpose. The woman nods towards the nun at the front of the classroom, nothing more than making her presence clear, no consideration, flicking the white streaks in her hair as she turns toward the class, zeroing in on Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>”Ms. Harkness. You’re needed in the Principal’s office.” The words are flat, but not devoid of the fake cheer sprinkled into all of Valentina’s affairs. </p><p> </p><p>It takes an extra second to process, to swing into the dutiful act of the Principal's daughter, close her binder and pack her things before standing to follow.</p><p> </p><p>She sighs at the heaviness of it, tries to wrestle away that panic that surfaces. Evanora had been better lately. And school was always a place of some level of safety. Evanora never got to sink in her claws when the walls were thin, when bruises would need to be covered before they could fully form. But it still burnt her next swallow, still made her hands shake. </p><p> </p><p>“Aww, such a good daughter.”</p><p> </p><p>”What a frigid bitch.” </p><p> </p><p>The words spring out as callous whispers as Agatha gets up to follow Valentina out of the classroom. The words ring against her ears like duct tape ripped from her skin without warning. She doesn’t look up, doesn’t try to find the culprits. She’ll let the grating retort die on her tongue afraid of the way her voice might crack, afraid of the way it would be perceived.</p><p> </p><p>”God is watching, shitheads.” Jen’s voice seethes in place of her own response, standing up for her without prompting, the contrast of God and the curse word used in the same sentence not completely lost on her. A reminder that their judgement would be punished, the fury of it condemning the two who’d spoken such ridicule to hell.</p><p> </p><p>”Ms. Kale!” Sister Abigail chastises her, offended by the teachings of their favorite  book more than the unprovoked words of bullies. </p><p> </p><p>Valentina doesn’t react to the mess of it, gives Agatha a curt smile that doesn’t reach her eyes, extends her hand out for Agatha to lead the way. </p><p> </p><p>It crosses her mind that she could have been called to the office over the loudspeaker, but using the intercom to request her presence would give her a chance to escape, a fleeting moment of contemplating running toward the nearest exit. Evanora hadn’t even given her that level of trust, sending out one of her trusted disciples to retrieve her instead.  </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t ask why she’s being summoned, doesn’t spare Valentina a glance. She listens to the bouncing echo of the older woman’s heels as they walk, focuses on the chorus of her own breathing, pictures Rio and her tired eyes on the balcony when she’d pulled away from the kiss enough to really look at her, that soft daze of bliss, that careful resignation to create space for all the happiness that was to come.</p><p> </p><p>It felt like worlds away now. Rio probably sat in art class, focused on a drawing she’d be spending too much time on, getting frustrated when her hand smudged the graphite. Agatha imagined that furrow in her brow, a determined look in her eyes as she pushed her eraser down too hard. </p><p> </p><p>She finally rounded the corner with Valentina right behind, stepping into the main office, glancing up at the Vice principal to confirm that she could walk through to the back towards Evanora’s private office.</p><p> </p><p>Valentina nods at her, a force indicating to keep going, to not keep her mother waiting. </p><p> </p><p>She knocks out of courtesy, three dull thuds of her knuckles against heavy wood before pushing it open, knowing her mother would be more annoyed to get up and open it for her than coming in without express permission.</p><p> </p><p>”Close the door. Sit.” Evanora barely looks at her, looking up from the paper she’s writing on, her script precise and sharp even from Agatha’s angle. Her glasses slide slightly down her nose, a pair of wired frames that make her look more wicked than wise. The words aren’t dripping with venom, a well-placed command that Agatha is used to, a direction she can follow. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha drops her bag in one of the cushioned chairs facing the desk before taking a seat in the other one. She presses away the need to regulate her breathing, keeps the deep sigh from escaping, she sits up straight, her hands folded to make herself look at ease, presenting to her mother the dutiful image of perfect daughter even if she was spiraling just under the surface. </p><p> </p><p>She waits with a self-soothing inner monologue. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>It’s okay.</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>You’re okay.</em> </p><p> </p><p>The words in her head battle with the scratch of her mother’s ballpoint pen, the crisp movement against paper, the speed something between careful and furious.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t figure out what exactly her mother is holding back. </p><p> </p><p>She focuses on the nameplate drilled into the front of the desk, the foggy gray of Times New Roman spelling out her mother’s name, as Evanora gets up from her squeaky desk chair, Agatha’s mind briefly curls against the insanely high tuition, the money they could be using to oil the hinges. She keeps her gaze on the nameplate, letting her mother move center stage, standing in front of her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes finally make the journey upward, knowing Evanora demanded to be looked at when stating her immaculate plans, keeping hold of the fleeting hope that this wasn’t disaster.</p><p> </p><p>Before her eyes can fully process the rage in Evanora’s, before she can move to defend herself, the sound of a crisp slap rings out, cracking like a whip, a force that turns Agatha’s face 90 degrees, forces her to stare at the wall as the pain in her cheek settles in, as she starts to understand what’s happening. </p><p> </p><p>It crushes what was left of her scarred expectations, that pipe dream that Evanora held the ability to give old wounds time to heal without opening new ones somewhere deep in her evil heart. It stings tears into her eyes, the physical jolt a shallow comparison to the way her soul seems to shake loose, crash over itself in haunted rotations. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora grabs hold of Agatha’s face before her brain can push her into a new action, her mother’s hands gripping around her cheeks with harsh pressure, Agatha’s hands lurch for her own thighs, a movement meant to ground her away from the cruel reality, too scared to pull at her mother’s wrists, a quaking voice echoing in her head that she was powerless, that she just needed to get through. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora forces Agatha’s head upwards, making sure her daughter was looking her in the eye, kept her fingers firmly pressed into her face, her own face filled with broken anger, a rising sun of heat and purpose.</p><p> </p><p>”I knew you were a slut, but I had hope you wouldn’t let that girl turn you into a homosexual,” Evanora’s words slide out like acidic sewage, the bruising of her fingers and the spit of her voice making Agatha’s entire body clench in fear, a desire to curl in on herself, trap this empty moment to now, not let it burst past the door, not give it the power to stay in her memories, to be carried into tomorrow, etch it somewhere that wouldn’t sit heavy on her heart.</p><p> </p><p>Evanora knew. </p><p> </p><p>And what was she supposed to do? Deny it? Pretend like Rio hadn’t been her only silver lining for years? Gloss over the only joy she had? Push away the truth of it when it wouldn’t change the way her mother hated her?</p><p> </p><p>It would be a quivering lie, a spun out tire mark of irrelevance. Evanora would know it was a lie. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can feel the cold trail of tears, can hear the launch of a sob in her throat even if it feels like someone else’s grief, registers the pain of Evanora’s hands roughly pushing her back, her head rocking like a rag doll before taking back control, her muscles stiff, her breathing erratic and her face hot. </p><p> </p><p>“You did this to yourself, Agatha,” Evanora’s fists harden, a flex in fingers that Agatha tries to stay aware of, tries to prepare herself for the next blow, a clear indication that she had no patience for Agatha’s tears. </p><p> </p><p>But Evanora’s hands don’t hit her again, not yet.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, it’s the twisted truth. This was a trap. It had always been a trap. For Evanora to pull back enough for Agatha to test her freedom, for Evanora to lure her into comfort, to learn exactly what her daughter was doing, just to swoop in to punish her for it. Agatha didn’t know how far it went, how many pawns in the crafted plan, but the callous skin left over her wounds had sunken her into the clutches of it without learning their lesson. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora leaned forward, getting close to her face, her eyes drowning in a furious pool of apathy, she took hold of Agatha’s chin this time, her fingers pushing against bone without remorse, forcing Agatha’s head back into the chair, forcing eye contact once again. </p><p> </p><p>“You really thought you could parade around with <em>that thing</em>,” Agatha’s heart tightens at the way Evanora talks about Rio, how she could discount her to nothing when she was the only true good Agatha had ever encountered, “in <em>my</em> school,” the disgust and resentment spilling free. </p><p> </p><p>“And you clearly don’t care about your own reputation, but you’ve never cared about how every time you fuck up it reflects on me,” behind the rage there is hurt, a trampling of emotion. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wonders how they could go this long like this, how she’d spent her whole life trying to consider how her actions directly affected her mother, how she’d prayed to God to make her into the perfect child every night since learning to speak, how she molded herself into a version of herself specifically for her mother’s liking and how it had never been enough. How even in all the strife, in all the loud aching, Evanora had never noticed, had never even bothered to look. There wasn't room for mistakes, no time for Agatha to be a child, perfection was the only acceptable existence, and Agatha had failed her every single time. </p><p> </p><p>“Of course someone would see you, but you don’t care, do you? So determined to ruin me.” Evanora lets go again, steps back and looks down, a look of almost pity, Agatha knows how she sees her, a pathetic excuse for a child, unwilling to answer to her own actions.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe Agatha’s a little slow at connecting all the dots here, but in the turmoil of self-preservation her brain finally puts it together.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda.</p><p> </p><p>The fucking bathroom. </p><p> </p><p>Fuck.</p><p> </p><p>Evanora takes another step back, watches the gears turn in Agatha’s head. Her body aches at the thought that the assault isn’t over, that her mother is simply resting in between performances. She watches her mother catch her breath, but refuses to let go of her own, bracing herself for whatever comes next.</p><p> </p><p>”Get out,” Evanora spits, something a little more resolved, looking at Agatha with deep shame, like she wasn’t a worthy opponent, “I can’t look at you right now.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha listens, her mind following the command without hesitation. She grabs her bag and yanks open the door, the breath coming back to her as her body realizes it’s over for now, the darkness ebbs away. </p><p> </p><p>She’s not sure how to feel about the empty office now. No Valentina, no secretary. No one there to hear the yelling, the bursting sobs, no one there to see the redness in her cheek that came from more than a blush, the tears yet to dry. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha allows her feet to carry her forward, a sense of auto-pilot, her brain carrying her towards safety without coherent thought. She finds the nearest bathroom, not the same one that got her into this mess, but the same stale odor of cleaning fluid, the same pattern of stalls and sinks. </p><p> </p><p>She’s not surprised by her own appearance, the mix of sweat and tears causing her hair to stick around her neck and against her cheeks, the biting red blob roughly the size of Evanora’s palm on the left side of her face, the way her eyes look far away, an absence of spark. </p><p> </p><p>Little spark. Mi chispita. Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches into her bag for her phone, hovers over their text thread, before locking it, dropping it back in. She couldn’t bring herself to text Rio, rip her out of class, she didn’t know how to explain, how she could drop the shriveled burden onto Rio when she could barely register it herself.</p><p> </p><p>She knew. Fuck. Evanora knew about them. Wanda had told her. That fucking bitch ran to the principal without hesitation to out the resident sinners. Of course. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe that’s why her earlier apology was only aimed at Rio, Wanda couldn't even look her in the eye, couldn’t confront the damage she was about to cause. Still, the impact was immediate, the hurried volcano torching over the life Agatha was trying to rebuild. </p><p> </p><p>She splashes her face with water, trying to breathe, fixing her hair into some semblance of normalcy, she pulls at the knots forming in the back of her head from the way she’d been thrust against the chair. </p><p> </p><p>She checks her phone again for the time. </p><p> </p><p>Twenty more minutes of pre-calculus. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t going back to that classroom right now, couldn’t handle the guarded perception, would rather her classmates assume that she earned the privilege as a nepo baby to miss out on a full lesson of calculator functions. </p><p> </p><p>After that was Spanish. A class Rio forced her to keep taking with her for the past 2 years that it was no longer a requirement. Agatha allowed it, would never admit to the way Rio speaking Spanish to her made her melt a little, or that she enjoyed it to a point, liked being able to understand most of the Vidal’s jokes without waiting for an explanation. </p><p> </p><p>Another class she wasn’t sure she’d be attending. Rio would question her absence, but she wasn’t sure she could face her yet.</p><p> </p><p>Fuck. She needs to get out of this bathroom. Stop tripping over her own thoughts, find somewhere to sit, somewhere to breathe. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mind races for a place to go, contemplating how full the library might be with 2 periods left in the day, wondering if she should go outside and soak in some vitamin D, if she should just walk home, curl into her bed and depression-sleep until tomorrow. </p><p> </p><p>She takes the staircase closest to her up to the second floor as the pattern of thoughts continue to stir, makes a path towards her locker, having a crumb of sanity left in remembering that she needs her History textbook for tonight’s homework. </p><p> </p><p>She holds onto that thought, trying to grasp at things that are less intense, the grayed-out green on the lockers, the rustle of students in an English classroom, she can hear them debating Julius Caesar, the crack of adolescent voices trying to make their point. </p><p> </p><p>She hears a piano.</p><p> </p><p>A faint flurry of music closed behind a solid door.</p><p> </p><p>The notes floating are certain but far away, a trained hand brushing against the keys with practiced ease. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha follows it, knowing where the noise must be coming from. Trusting the safety of it.</p><p> </p><p>She turns the knob and pushes open the door, peeking her head in just enough to find the piano and the person playing it on the other side.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m not available right now, you can come ba-“ Sister Calderu starts to say, her fingers stuttering against the keys, her words abruptly ending when she finally looks up at the intruder. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Lilia says her name like a pleasant surprise, holding it up like something to admire, it flitting through the air with all the adoration Evanora never assigns to it.</p><p> </p><p>”Sorry,” Agatha apologizes, her hand still on the door knob, yet to cross the threshold, ready to close it and walk away, “I didn’t mean to bother you.”</p><p> </p><p>”No,” Lilia gets up from the piano in a drastic flourish, a commanding caress of keeping Agatha from leaving, “please, come in.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha listens, caution in the way she pushes the door open, waits for the choir teacher to change her mind. She’s thinking about the way she’d so willfully obeyed Evanora’s violent demands, but always hesitated in the wake of anyone offering her something soft. </p><p> </p><p>She places her bag on the floor, sits in the front row of seats closest to the piano, gives Lilia the time to settle back in front of it. </p><p> </p><p>The nun takes a moment to look at her, showing something careful and wistful in her eyes, like she’s remembering the past, like she has a question to ask, but she’s not ready to ask it. </p><p> </p><p>It reminds Agatha of her one required year of Choir, of singing hymns as a freshman with a sense of pride, the dull lessening of her faith still not as apparent at the time. She remembers how Sister Calderu looked at her sometimes, a careful consideration like she could solve the changing puzzle in Agatha’s eyes. It reminds her of Evanora telling her to keep her distance from the nun, how her mother wouldn’t allow her to take the class another year, told her she could sing at church if she wanted to. It confused her then, how her Aunt Lilia had morphed into a monster made by her mother’s vague stories of ‘that woman is no good’ and ‘she is not like us, Agatha’. Whatever the full story was, Agatha was not in a position to question it. </p><p> </p><p>She knew the truth. Well, most of the truth. </p><p> </p><p>Lilia was a friend. A good friend. A good person.</p><p> </p><p>And Evanora would never allow Agatha a friend.</p><p> </p><p>Not then, when Lilia was the only person to value her opinion. </p><p> </p><p>Not now, when Rio empowered her to find her own strength for the first time in her life. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha lapses over the shifting memory, a vague sense of being 8 or 9. She remembers the voices more than what she could see. Lilia asking Evanora about the bruises, she doesn’t remember the exact mode of deflection, just that Lilia had been adamant that the severity was worse than childhood clumsiness, that the conversation ended with Evanora forcing her out of their house. </p><p> </p><p>“What were you playing?” Agatha asks to fill the newly threatened silence, but also to hold off on coursing further down memory lane. </p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s fingers find the keys again, trapezing over them like a professional ballet dancer, the notes ring out again, clearer without the wall separating Agatha from them, she listens closely, knows Lilia is waiting for her to pick up the melody.</p><p> </p><p>Landslide by Fleetwood Mac, Agatha recognizes it as it glides into the chorus. One of Lilia’s hands playing as the piano version of the guitar, the other striking the melody of Stevie Nicks’ voice.</p><p> </p><p>”Secular music? Really Sister Calderu?” Agatha jokes, breaking the tension of the solemn beauty of the song, faking a surprised gasp.</p><p> </p><p>She wonders where it’s coming from, that gentle push back into joking, wonders whether it’s a coping mechanism or a sign that her body still feels safe with Lilia. </p><p> </p><p>The nun chuckles, appreciating the barb, not as uptight or strict as some of the other nuns, especially with students she felt protective of. Agatha had always seen her display a humanity that most of their other teachers hadn’t, an example of a confident personality that she hadn’t compromised in her relationship with God. </p><p> </p><p>“I can only listen to ‘I Am The Bread of Life’ so many times before my ears beg for something different.” Lilia sort of whines thinking of that particular hymn, like the truth of her words weighs heavy.</p><p> </p><p>”Isn’t Stevie Nicks a witch?” Agatha asks, pushing on it a little harder, wanting Sister Calderu to keep the light banter going. </p><p> </p><p>The nun sort of scoffs, pushing the thought away with a gesture of her hands like the sentiment was pure bullshit.</p><p> </p><p>“Just a rumor started by men who couldn’t comprehend a successful woman.”</p><p> </p><p>”I’ll take your word for it, Sister Calderu.”</p><p> </p><p>”Lilia,” the older woman chimes in to correct the name this time, almost like a deep breath she’s taking like Agatha calling her that in this space grated on something that went way beyond teacher and student. “You can still call me Lilia.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods. Smiles at her own trembling thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>”Calling you Lilia makes me feel like we’re colleagues or something”, it’s a touch of jest, but the grounding pain of it feels like a loss. </p><p> </p><p>“Aunt Lilia, then?”</p><p> </p><p>It feels like a careful offer, an apology for not trying harder to stay all those years ago, like a cave that sat in Agatha’s chest wondering how life would have been if Evanora gave Lilia just one more second to really see her, gave her just enough space to really know the truth, to get Agatha out of there. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t mad at her. She knew her mother’s power and influence better than anyone, knew that Lilia had always been on her side, even if it was a part of her life that collapsed and faded. </p><p> </p><p>“okay”</p><p> </p><p>The silence returns, but it hangs like a protective blanket, a step in the direction of reconciliation. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you alright, dear?” Lilia asks.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha isn’t sure where the curiosity comes from. Maybe the way her eyes had still shown the after effects of crying, slightly puffy, the whites of her eyes more pink. Maybe it was the fading red of her cheek, none of Rio’s makeup to soften the coloring. Maybe it was the fact that she’d strolled into this classroom for the first time in years without an indicated reason.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head, the honesty of it pushing against her throat, her eyes threatening to spill tears again. She breathes, shuts her eyes for a few seconds, just long enough for the swell of it to pass, the vulnerability pressing into her like something she can’t show.</p><p> </p><p>”I don’t really want to talk about it.” She doesn’t meet Lilia’s eyes, can’t let her see all of it. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay.” Lilia answers like it isn’t a burden, like she was ready to listen, but not willing to push, giving Agatha the freedom to choose. A choice that didn’t feel like a trap.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia turns around, awkwardly reaching over desk for something instead of getting up to walk to the other side. Agatha can’t make out what she’s grabbing.</p><p> </p><p>”Here,” The nun offers as she tosses the item across the 3 feet between them, “Chocolate cures everything.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha catches it, her face showing confusion as she reads the label on the red packaging.</p><p> </p><p>”Milk Chocolate Candy Wafers Bar?” She questions the off-brand version of a Kit Kat now sitting in her hands. </p><p> </p><p>“Just eat it, it tastes the same,” Lilia grumbles, biting into a not-snickers bar. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha opens the plastic just enough to break off a corner and give it a fair taste. Lilia raises her eyebrows, a silent question of Agatha’s final verdict on the chocolate bar, while still chewing her own mess of chocolate, caramel, and peanuts.</p><p> </p><p>She shrugs. “It’s fine, I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia gets up from her chair, putting her hand out for Agatha to hand her back the candy. She breaks off her own piece tasting it for herself as if to confirm or deny Agatha’s opinion. </p><p> </p><p>She chews, contemplating. </p><p> </p><p>“It's missing something.” </p><p> </p><p>“Corporate greed.” Agatha supplies without missing a beat. </p><p> </p><p>Lilia laughs, a pleased smile settling and not leaving, the wave of nostalgia clear on her features. </p><p> </p><p>“I missed you, kid.” Lilia touches her shoulder, a delicate support, the certainty of it hanging between them. </p><p> </p><p>“Where do you even buy these?” Agatha asks, reading the label again when Lilia hands it back to her. </p><p> </p><p>Lilia shrugs like she’s got an off-brand candy dealer who she isn’t quite ready to sell out.</p><p> </p><p>”Can’t afford a real almond joy,” She scoffs at herself, “I wasn't really thinking about my candy intake when I became a nun and took a vow of poverty.”</p><p> </p><p>”The amount they pay you guys is bullshit,” Agatha munches on another piece of the bar, something to keep her busy, her stomach still not completely settled from earlier. “Sorry,” she adds, realizing her own curse word too late. “Bull…” she tries to correct it, find a Catholic approved alternative, “What’s an acceptable substitute?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia laughs, never seeming offended by it, clearly agreeing with the teenager. </p><p> </p><p>“I think the words you’re looking for are ‘fucking terrible’”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles, gives the words the strength to rip through the last of her lingering anxiety.</p><p> </p><p>”Sounds right to me.”</p><p> </p>

<p>1 Timothy 4:15-16- Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress. Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia doesn’t force Agatha out of her classroom when the bell rings. She has a class to teach; freshman choir, a group of noisy pubescent teenagers that fill almost every seat in the room. But she’d squared Agatha with a firm look, something that said ‘hear me when I speak’, and said “You can stay here if you need to.”</p><p> </p><p>The invitation hit her like a promise, like a safety net extended over any possible landing spots. Still, she doesn’t know how to say ‘thank you’, doesn’t know how to take the offer, allow herself to be seen as vulnerable, taking help without even asking for it. She hates that it’s visible, that Lilia knew something was wrong without having to voice it.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe Rio had made her soft, especially lately, dulling the harsh edges into someone less intense, the cutting words she used to protect herself often slipping towards something a little less violent, a playful push in place of a full on stabbing. </p><p> </p><p>It felt strange, but good. The conflict of falling into herself, cutting away the parts of her identity that existed in favor of survival, trying to recognize the things about her that hadn’t been shaped out of external expectations, or the strict rules set out by her mother. </p><p> </p><p>That leap of progress had surged like a pet spider, something tangible she could hold, and nourish, but also still tickled as it walked across her skin, still had her fearful of the scurrying legs and potential bites. In all the growth, there was still caution, but still not enough.</p><p> </p><p>The slap to the face felt just as symbolic too, the rug pulled from beneath her feet just as she started to gain her footing. It served as a reminder that Evanora would always have the upper hand, that in all the glimpses of joy, she’d always be designed to return here where spiders died and daughters listened. </p><p> </p><p>An attempt at an escape crawls out of her plans, her feet tracing the careful pattern of one step in front of the other, guiding her towards her Spanish classroom. She pulls out her phone, looking at herself in the front facing camera, not wanting to give Rio the evidence to start an interrogation. Her cheeks are dry now, the whisper of red in her eyes less noticeable, the sting of red on her cheek faded. She realizes that the slap graced her left cheek and Rio’s desk was on her right, the epiphany offering some relief. But her blue eyes have lost their glow, the growing spark that sang of profacsized returns, sat as a shrinking ache, a pain that stomped out the brightness. </p><p> </p><p>And maybe that was what kept her walking. Rio. Her torch. A crippling need to return to that scorching light. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes her seat with a steadying breath, pushes away the shuddering attempt at her impenetrable walls jolting back up, she closes her eyes, forces them back down, a careful truce made with the person she was and the person she wants to be. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora had made a mistake in giving her an inch, in showing her what life could be like without the weight of perfection, the constant lurking eyes of callous fear, the doubtful thunder that stormed like rage in her gut over every move she dared to make. She’d gotten a taste of freedom, a small shuddering lick of something warm and full. Like chocolate cake, a chance at sugar for the first time, richer than she’d allowed herself to imagine. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was her chocolate cake, the start of a new beginning, a place to celebrate, blow out candles, stability in the layers, the chance to indulge herself, show her the world and what it had to offer without the solemn cloud of constantly having to check over her shoulder. It was the wiggle room she needed to kiss Rio for the first time, to find safety in brown eyes and her cocky smile, to dream up the possibility of a life that wasn’t always darkness.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha meditates on it for a moment, tries to elongate the dwindling time she has where her classmates shuffle into their seats, the shifting truth that Rio will be next to her within seconds. </p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t know how to process it, maybe that’s why it feels akin to suffocating, maybe it's not the same warped anxiety, but there’s still something unfamiliar in the way Rio’s energy seems to caress her, hold her up like she is weightless, give her the strength to take on the uncertainty, carries her trauma for her. Maybe it isn’t anxiety at all. Maybe it's excitement. Something she hadn’t felt for a long time. An eager enthusiasm to see the person who has loved her without question for so long, the person dedicated to her growth when Agatha could only focus on staying alive, the person who had protected her fiercely, was gentle with her in the wake of all her mess, was still patient with her, allowed her the time to let the unfamiliarity wash into comfort. </p><p> </p><p>It feels similar to the way her chest aches in fear, but the negative connotation melts away. Thinking of Rio, even at the chance of her anger, even with a tough conversation looming, standing in the reality of her pain and letting Rio see it, Agatha still felt a sense of peace. Rio’s voice ringing in her head like a church bell, a reminder that everything is going to be okay. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels her before she sees her, the shuffling beside her, Rio’s book bag hung loose on the back of her chair, her shoes shifting against the tile. She keeps her eyes closed a second longer, let’s the security of it wash over her. </p><p> </p><p>“Hola, hermosa,” falls from Rio’s mouth like a blessing, the Spanish wrapping around her tongue more easily than Agatha’s attempt at an accent. “Para ti.” Rio adds as Agatha opens her eyes to find the taller girl standing beside her desk, her hand outstretched. </p><p> </p><p>A part of Agatha is annoyed at the way Rio had swung easily into speaking Spanish, the calm switch as if she felt obligated to communicate that way in this classroom, a joke that edged closely to an added layer of comfort.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha remembers Mr. Vidal explaining to her that they’d only spoken Spanish in their household until Rio turned 5, wanting to still give her the foundations of their first language before going to school and learning English, even if both parents spoke it well, they still wanted their daughter to follow the tradition, to be able to hold her own amongst her older extended family. </p><p> </p><p>She’s remembers Mrs. Vidal’s loud laughter as she recounted the story of how Rio didn’t answer to her own name on her first day of Kindergarten when her teacher took attendance, how Rio really thought her name was Chispita. She remembers Rio’s face in response to the story, a touch of embarrassment at sharing it with Agatha before she’d seen the way it made her smile, thinking of little Rio clumsy and unaware.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha still rolls her eyes, not wanting Rio to think she’s gone completely soft, always amused by Rio's commitment to the bit. She finally looks down at the offered object, she takes it in her hands inspecting it closer. </p><p> </p><p>It’s a round-flat rock, about two inches in diameter. A soft grain against her fingers. On the face of it sits a painted design, a spiraled maze of lines, a swirling star at the center, the lines skillfully painted in black and gold. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grazes her fingertips over it, flipping it over in her palm to find ‘RV’ carved in the back, before flipping it back, finding Rio’s eyes again, a silent question, waiting for an explanation,</p><p> </p><p>”It was a little art project,” Rio is sort of perched over Agatha’s desk, palms holding herself up against the surface of it, sinking closer, making a space for just their voices amongst the chatter around them. She shrugs like it isn’t a big deal, letting her voice trade back to English, something more nonchalant. “Finally got a grade back for it, so I could give it to you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at it again, searching for the divine power of the symbol, wonders briefly how Rio had effortlessly crafted things with Agatha in mind, like she was never an afterthought, like she was the whole goddamn reason. </p><p> </p><p>“I obviously got an A,” Rio laughs to herself, smug, as she pushes off Agatha’s desk to finally sit at her own. To any onlookers, it seemed like a breezy shift, like the movement wasn’t charged, but Agatha followed the retreat, knew Rio was withdrawing in the swell of her own emotion, suddenly shy to explain it. </p><p> </p><p>“What does it mean?” Agatha asks, quiet, thoughtful, wanting to know the weight of it, especially if it was causing Rio to hesitate. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s Hecate’s wheel.” Rio starts, flipping open her binder to a fresh page of loose leaf, not meeting Agatha’s eyes, “The goddess of magic, and crossroads,” she adds like it wasn’t the driving force, knowing Agatha’s life had always felt like a battle of choice, which path to take; the one that had been violently paved by her mother’s commands or the one she’d have to find for herself. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s a shield,” Rio finally looks up at her, brown eyes soft, a crisp understanding, “It’s a symbol of protection.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, shifting her glances between the rock and Rio, trying to find the composure to respond, trying to comprehend the tidal wave of care Rio sprung onto her with practiced ease, it didn’t feel like drowning in the current anymore, it felt like learning to float. She wasn’t swimming on her own yet, but it felt like a step in the right direction, keeping her head above water long enough to figure out how to paddle. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s beautiful.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes shine brighter then, like Agatha’s acceptance means everything, the delicate reverence she holds the stone with, the careful contemplation of its meaning, the grace with which Agatha is allowing her to love her steadily, it makes the pressure of her heartbeat hard to ignore. </p><p> </p><p>The bell rings, signaling the official start of class cutting off any chance at furthering the exchange. Brother Morales enters the room in a flurry, one of the only male teachers brave enough to deal with the quaking dramatics of girls in their teens. He’s young, probably in his twenties still, a hellstorm of crushes flung at him as one of the only consistent targets for their straight peers. </p><p> </p><p>One time he’d printed the answer sheet to the test on the last page and didn’t realize until 30 minutes later, when some teacher’s pet had to point it out to him, citing ‘academic integrity’ and ‘following God’. His aloof nature is enough to distract her out of the deep swirl of emotions. </p><p> </p><p>She does her best to follow along with the 500th explanation of conjugating ‘ser’ vs ‘estar’ like they haven’t been doing this since freshman year. She looks over at Rio, who on top of being a fucking nerd, had been unknowingly doing this in conversation her entire life before she even knew what verbs were. She doesn’t look bored, but definitely not fully immersed, none of the lesson landing as new information. But there’s definitely a stream of unfolding thoughts behind brown eyes, something more than the usual air of quiet confidence. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls her phone out from under her thigh, the same place she kept it through most of her classes, pressed between her seat and the fabric of her skirt, skillfully hidden from the prying eyes of strict nuns, but ready to be used at a moment's notice. </p><p> </p><p>Sitting pretty far from the front of the classroom, it’s easy to slide it onto her desk, navigate to her text thread with Rio with one hand, crafting the outer perception that ‘vosotros’ was a very interesting part of Brother Morales’ lesson. </p><p> </p><p>‘r u ok???’ Agatha types out, hitting send before she even thinks to question if Rio’s phone is on silent. Maybe she’s projecting, reading into the quiet resolve of the girl next to her, because she hasn’t processed her own thoughts, hasn’t fully recovered from the mayhem in her mother’s office. </p><p> </p><p>For a fleeting moment, Agatha thinks that if Rio had given her that rock an hour earlier, Evanora’s rage wouldn’t have been able to reach her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio turns to her, the dull buzz coming from the pocket of her blazer, not loud enough to get their teacher’s attention but a clear signal to Rio, confirmation that it was Agatha texting her at the sight of her lilac colored phone case at the side of her desk before even unlocking her own phone. </p><p> </p><p>‘Ya, r u?’ </p><p> </p><p>Rio keeps her eyes forward, maybe an effort to keep up the illusion, maybe another attempt at hiding the full depths of her feelings. Agatha can’t read all of it right now, something complicated. </p><p> </p><p>‘u can’t freak out’</p><p>’but we have to talk after class’</p><p>’it’s about Evanora’</p><p> </p><p>It feels strange using her mother’s government name like that, not that she’s in any way deeply connected to the placating connection of calling her ‘mom’ but she and Rio had always played with harsh nicknames using anything from ‘she-devil’ to ‘wicked gnome’. But that felt too trivial right now, condemning the gravity of it to a grating barb, it felt reductive, and maybe facing the whole truth of it was the start to making it end. </p><p> </p><p>‘Can’t u tell me right now?’ Rio answers, impatient. Agatha watches out of the corner of her eye as Rio shifts in her chair, fidgets with her pen. Maybe she should have waited to reveal the truth, maybe it was wrong to dangle the bloodied carrot in front of her face and make her wait for the whole story. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her lip, she turns to Rio, trying to make the girl turn to her without a word. Brown eyes find blue like a magnet, the burning coffee of her irises set into something open yet sad, waiting for bad news, searching for the guillotine that Evanora would inevitably send shooting into Agatha’s neck, wondering what form it took as she sinks into the roaring ocean of Agatha’s eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Blue eyes turn back to her phone, a new attempt at finding the right words to explain. Her fingers hover over the keyboard, but they don’t spring into action, her mind coming up blank on where to start.</p><p> </p><p>Before she can spiral back into the worry of it, or punish herself for not knowing, two new texts comes through. The gray bubbles not a figment of her imagination, but Rio’s words shining back at her.</p><p> </p><p>’Fineeee I’ll wait…’ Agatha can hear the whine in Rio’s words even if not said out loud.</p><p> </p><p>’But were getting ice cream’</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>The pink spoon in Rio’s mouth is a distraction. </p><p> </p><p>Okay, maybe it’s just Rio’s mouth, but the plastic isn’t helping.</p><p> </p><p>Rio isn’t exactly the neatest eater, especially when it’s just her and Agatha in Rio’s car, parked in an abandoned lot, 2 cups of ice cream, and the radio turned down from Rio’s preferred volume of ‘way too fucking loud’ (according to Agatha of course). </p><p> </p><p>It’s just them and some old R&amp;B song Agatha doesn’t recognize. Agatha thinks to grab Rio’s phone off the center console, change it to something else, anything to put her focus elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p>The bit of chocolate on the corner of Rio’s mouth wins against the fear in her gut, and perhaps that’s its own battle to win, knowing that she didn’t have to think about her mother forever, that she could forget about Evanora in favor of remembering the girl in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio and her eyes that looked like fresh coffee grounds, the softness of her hands like she hadn’t spent half her life with a pencil in between her fingers, the way she could read Agatha like a book (something she loved as much as she absolutely hated), the way her tongue graced the plastic spoon like the mint chocolate chip flavor was something to be savored to the last drop.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was barely touching her own, a small cup of Butter Pecan, her own spoon busy stirring around the contents, rarely reaching her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re assaulting your ice cream?” Rio points her spoon at Agatha, her body turned  towards the passenger side, one of her shoes off, knee bent, her sock-clad foot pressed into the leather seat. “Does it taste weird?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn't answer with words, simply holds up her cup to Rio as an offering, giving her the opportunity to taste. Rio takes the bait, dipping her spoon in without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>With the spoon back in Rio’s mouth, Agatha tries to focus on the question at hand, if Rio approves of her flavor choice, but she gets caught on pink lips, the way her cheeks hollow around the cold bite.</p><p> </p><p>Rio scowls after a moment, spitting the pecan out of her mouth into her own empty cup like it truly offended her. </p><p> </p><p>“Nuts are gross”</p><p> </p><p>”She really is a lesbian, ladies and gentlemen,” Agatha announces dramatically like they’re in front of a live studio audience.</p><p> </p><p>”Who said I’m a lesbian?” Rio asks, still reeling from the taste, but never thrown by Agatha’s attempts at humor.</p><p> </p><p>”Umm, your tongue told me earlier when it was in my mouth,” Agatha squints her eyes, “You remember, right?”</p><p> </p><p>”I don’t think the bisexuals of the world would appreciate that assumption,” Rio adds, playing into the bit, as if it wasn’t just them privy to this conversation. She reaches forward with her spoon again, aiming to take another scoop of Agatha’s ice cream. </p><p> </p><p>But Agatha pulls it out of her reach, confusion clear on her face.</p><p> </p><p>“You just said you didn’t like it.” </p><p> </p><p>“Maybe I’ll like it the second time.” Rio says like it makes perfect sense, obviously convinced by her own logic. </p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” Agatha brings it back within reach, “but let me warn you, it still has nuts.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio goes in for her second taste, finding the same outcome, complete with the pecan hurled out of her mouth, and into the paper cup.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha levels her with a look of ‘I told you so’ but there’s also a clear lack of patience, an attempt at hiding her amusement. Rio just smirks, shrugs.</p><p> </p><p>”Spitting is kind of fun”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand comes up to her own face, her fingers squeezing the bridge of her nose, shaking her head at her reality. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m dating a fucking child”</p><p> </p><p>”We’re dating?” Rio asks, a teasing smile in her voice, “Wow, Agatha you’re really killing it with these assumptions.”</p><p> </p><p>”Can you focus for two seconds so we can be serious?” Agatha huffs, not really mad at Rio, still trying to piece together how to tell her what just happened, frustrated that her life swung like a pendulum between a demon and the sweetest person she’d ever met. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m just trying to distract you,” Rio’s voice is soft now, her hand holding onto Agatha’s arm, stroking against her skin like an apology. </p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Agatha sighs, resigning herself to that truth, that Rio was only trying to help, “You’re really good at that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes find Rio’s with a delicate resolve, somewhere her mind doesn’t want to settle, shaken by the safety of it. She can’t stop them from drifting back down to Rio’s lips, yearning for that connection again. </p><p> </p><p>“Focus,” Rio shakes her arm slightly, a chuckle on her lips, knowing exactly what Agatha wants. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head at herself, angry at her inability to conceal her desires, thrown at how bad she’s become at hiding herself. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m definitely not kissing you after you ate that mint monstrosity,” She bites out instead, pushing out an attempt at self-preservation, at erasing the fact that Rio had witnessed her vulnerability. </p><p> </p><p>“Who said anything about kissing?”</p><p> </p><p>”Rio,” Agatha warns, the full press of it filling the space inside the car. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, okay,” Rio starts, shifting herself into being a good listener, she takes Agatha’s hand fully now, squeezes slightly, “tell me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her lip, resolving herself to spill it all, tread lightly against the waves of guilt and shame that threaten to burst out. </p><p> </p><p>“Evanora knows about us.” she starts, looking down at their intertwined hands, softly stroking against Rio’s fingers, trying to find the strength in it, unwilling to look her in the eye. “Wanda told her.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s body slides forward, a snap like a boomerang, her hand squeezing slightly, Agatha tries not to recoil, tries to sink into the pull instead of fighting against the magnetism. </p><p> </p><p>“How do you know?” Rio’s voice is edged with worry, but there’s control there too, a clear attempt at holding in her own fear to make room for Agatha’s feelings, “Did Wanda say something to you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head ‘no’, focuses on her breathing, the warmth of Rio’s hand, the spinning pulse of the song vibrating the car. </p><p> </p><p>“Valentina escorted me to the office,” the anger in Agatha’s voice combats the pain, a swirl of conflict on how to feel, “My mother- um..”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s anger doesn’t carry her very far, losing the energy of it, wishing she had the strength to find the truth.</p><p> </p><p>”Did she hurt you?” Rio’s voice is a whisper, a safety net of care, no anger to show in brown eyes as she holds Agatha’s face in her hand, strokes her cheek, forces the eye contact, can’t let Agatha hide the full truth anymore.</p><p> </p><p>The question feels absurdly stupid. Because of course, Evanora had hurt her everyday of her life, with words, with hands, with hangers and textbooks and anything within reach that would sting, that would leave a mark. But it also hits a place in her heart that has gone untouched for so long, a stone unturned, a gentle question like Rio would fight against the war in her mind as much as she’d protect her in the outside world, hold her through it. Agatha still didn’t know how to fully accept the genuine care that Rio offered, how it was never transactional, an unlimited supply of patience and adoration. It still felt like she was tainting the purity of Rio with her evil sometimes, like she couldn’t possibly deserve her. </p><p> </p><p>But that was the one choice Rio always made for her. To be there for her, regardless of any attempts at pushing her away, at pretending Agatha didn’t mean the world to her. Rio didn’t look at her like something to fix. Rio was the only one that saw her.</p><p> </p><p>As a person, as someone who deserved way more than the life Evanora had offered like a holy gift, when it was only built with hateful expectations and scraps of survival skills. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know how to dig up the version of herself that knew how to exist without the leash, didn’t know if she had the strength to wash away the dirt from her fingernails, how to push away the heavy mounds of earth and face the light without suffocating.</p><p> </p><p>But looking into Rio’s eyes, feeling the steady stream of care, knowing that this person loved her; as a friend, as something more now, a full spectrum of all the moments they’d shared, that Rio was by her side everyday willing to stay her friend if it meant keeping her safe, willing to hide her own feelings forever if Agatha wasn’t ready to face them. Maybe it was the curse of her existence, only being able to feel the fire with her fingertips but never being able to burn.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted to burn with Rio, understand every inch of her mind, worship her for all the harsh words she’d erased, replaced with delicate promises and a solid love that she couldn’t push away. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods finally, answering Rio’s question.</p><p> </p><p>”But I’m okay,” She tries to reassure her, the brown eyes in front of her sad and dark, a deep pain that rivals the way she holds Agatha so carefully. She barely recognizes her own voice, the gruff mess of it, the sting of tears back in her eyes, the slow precision of Rio’s fingers brushing them away. </p><p> </p><p>Rio moves forward, pressing a few kisses solidly into Agatha’s forehead, never letting go of her face, hoping to push her own care directly into Agatha’s skin. </p><p> </p><p>She pulls back just enough to look into blue eyes again, finds the space to dissolve the big feelings, give them a moment to wallow in it before setting it free. </p><p> </p><p>The song changes then, a soft beat that gives way to ‘It Wasn’t Me’ by Shaggy suddenly moving through the speakers, perhaps the Spotify Gods trying to ruin the moment, pushing them out of the pain. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinks. Rio chuckles at the absurdity of it. </p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck is this playlist?” Agatha asks, half mad, half amused, a scoff around her tears.</p><p> </p><p>Rio breaks the hold, opening her phone, Agatha takes the moment to wipe her own face, looking for a tissue in Rio’s mess of a glove box. She finds a crusty napkin between an old pack of gummy worms and a happy meal toy and deems it clean enough to blow her nose.</p><p> </p><p>”It's called ‘Songs that make my pp hard’,” Rio angles the phone enough for Agatha to see, prove she isn’t joking. </p><p> </p><p>“Shaggy gets your dick hard?” Agatha laughs fully now, her voice still not completely back to normal, but a sense of spark back in her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“Something about only understanding half of what he’s saying really gets me going,”</p><p> </p><p>”I’ll try to remember that the next time I’m trying to turn you on,” Agatha winks, tries to settle it in her mind as a joke, like thinking of Rio in that context isn’t setting her insides on fire. </p><p> </p><p>“Uhhh, I don’t really think you have to put in much effort,” Rio responds, her own voice sort of hushed, “But the emotional whiplash of wanting to murder your mother one second and thinking about-“ Rio’s eyes widen, her eyebrows shoot up for emphasis, unable to put a word to what they’re actually discussing, “the next is kind of making my head hurt.”</p><p> </p><p>”Poor baby,” Agatha’s hand finds Rio’s cheek, recentering them, the tease of her voice meant to loosen the last of the anguish left in the air. </p><p> </p><p>“So,” Rio sighs, mentally preparing herself for the pushback, “You’re staying at my house tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>”Rio,” Agatha tries at a new warning, a familiar course of pushing away from extended hands of help, the devil on her shoulder already perched and ready to remind of all the reasons she can’t. “You know I can’t”</p><p> </p><p>”Well, you won’t let me actually murder your mother. And I know whatever happened in that office was just an opening act to whatever horror show she has planned.” Rio’s mad again, the blush in her cheeks reading different than when she’s flustered. </p><p> </p><p>“What’s one more bruise? Rio, sure. You can save me from it tonight but you can’t save me from her forever.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s words plunge out like a stab to the throat, Rio stares at her, letting it sink in.</p><p> </p><p>”You’re right,” Rio chokes out, but it isn’t her backing down, brown irises never straying away from blue, Agatha can see the rising tears, the sharp edge of fighting for the person she loves even when Agatha is doing her best to stop her. “I can’t save you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio says it like the words hurt her, like the truth is painful. The reality that Rio couldn’t pluck her out of her mother’s hold, fly her somewhere safe and warm, keep her heart full long enough to forget the darkness, it made Rio tremble, powerless. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not God,” RIo starts again, no echo of resignation, “I can’t offer you salvation.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha holds her gaze despite the grief reflected in Rio’s eyes, she deserves to know all the hurt she’d pressed into her skin, to be punished for the burden she’s inflicted on Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“But you can’t expect me to watch from a distance forever, especially now.” Rio squeezes her wrist, a reminder of passionate kisses, the blooming of romantic feelings out in the open, the chapter they couldn’t erase, “I have a place to keep you safe, let me use it.”</p><p> </p><p>“So what happens after tonight? I just stay with you forever? Your parents are gonna be okay with that?” Agatha speaks up, another attempt at finding a reason to turn down Rio’s offer, unable to meet the vulnerability, mad at herself for creating the tangle of emotions in brown eyes. She pulls her hand out of Rio’s grasp, jarred by the soft touch against hardened words.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” an answer Agatha doesn’t expect, yet slips from Rio’s mouth easily, “If we tell them the tru-“</p><p> </p><p>”We’re not telling them.” </p><p> </p><p>“Why are you so hell bent on protecting her?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice shoots out like a cannon, too sharp, too quick, unable to take back. The car feels too small, like the space between them wasn’t enough to hold onto all the mud they’d been struggling through, like the thickness of the air is coated in more than just the lasting sweetness of ice cream and the lowered volume of the radio. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t have an answer. It’s her mother. And fuck, as terrible as life has been, as painful as the wounds are, as deep as the words cut. It’s still her mother. The only constant she’s had for seventeen years. Before Rio, before Lilia. It was her mother and God. And she was already letting God slip away. </p><p> </p><p>And maybe too, it was the fact that it would only prove Evanora right, that Agatha was selfish, only cared about herself, unwilling to find a shred of care for her mother’s reputation.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio’s voice surges back in after a moment, a tender earnesty that Agatha doesn’t know how to hold, “I- that was too far.”</p><p> </p><p>”I’ll stay with you,” Agatha rubs at her own face, nothing gentle in the way she stamps away her tears, losing patience with herself for the amount of times she’s cried today. </p><p> </p><p>“Really?” Rio sounds so hopeful, like a child promised a trip to Disney World and Agatha can’t it back now, not after witnessing the hope in her face. </p><p> </p><p>“For tonight.” Agatha clarifies, not wanting to misconstrue the extent of her promise, “And we’ll figure out the rest later.”</p><p> </p><p>”Thank you,” Rio grovels like she has something to truly be thankful for, like Agatha had granted her three wishes with no caveats. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha kisses her, because words are still a work in progress, because she doesn’t think the words exist to tell Rio how she feels, because she can’t watch Rio crumble for another second. The taste of mint on her tongue plagues her like an afterthought, doing the things she told herself she wouldn’t. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Deuteronomy 28:6- Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s in Agatha’s bedroom for the second time in their lives and she can’t stop her mind from retracing the aftermath of the first time- when Evanora had realized someone had been in her room, the stinging cut above her eyebrow, the bruise on her cheekbone, the way Rio had taken care of her like always. </p><p> </p><p>“Toothbrush, socks, deodorant.” Rio is throwing essentials in a duffel bag, checking things off in her head as she adds them. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s sitting on her bed, flipping through an old journal she’d kept hidden in middle school, before she’d stopped writing, before she’d met Rio. She’s not being helpful, especially considering they’re on borrowed time, Evanora due home in the next 15 to 30 minutes, Rio’s car parked out front for once for an easy getaway. Rio had made a joke about Bonnie and Clyde. Agatha agreed, “As long as I get to be Clyde.” That grounding snark felt far away now. </p><p> </p><p>“You can definitely use my body wash, but do you want me to grab your face stuff? I know your skin’s kinda sensitive,” Rio muses while looking through Agatha’s closet, deciding what clothes are worth taking, like she was already set on this being more than a one night sleepover, like they didn’t have school tomorrow.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer, caught on cycling through crinkled pages, not on a particular word or thought, but maybe the changing loops of her handwriting overtime, maybe the way she’d felt so far removed from the pre-teen spilling her guts into unlined pages, shoving the book into the space between her bed and the wall every night to hide from Evanora. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Rio steps in front of her, trying to get her attention, a hand resting on her bare knee, yet to change out of her uniform, “You okay?”</p><p> </p><p>”Did you grab my hairbrush?” Agatha deflects, flipping the journal closed, moving to stand up.</p><p> </p><p>”Agatha,” Rio says her name like she always does, a song on every syllable, “Are you okay?”</p><p> </p><p>”Yeah,” She says as she stands, a clawing truth to the way it clings to the air as they come eye to eye, Agatha’s hands reach for Rio’s hips, bringing them closer, reveling in the way it was starting to feel natural, reaching out, knowing that falling back together was inevitable, “I just realized I don’t want to be in this house anymore.”</p>

<p>1 Thessalonians 3:12- And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all, as we do for you</p><p> </p><p>Sitting in front of Rio’s old desktop computer wasn’t exactly the intended destination when Agatha decided she wanted to be out of her house, but Rio was adamant about  showing her all the gaming she’d missed out on as a kid living with Evanora.</p><p> </p><p>It was the same way when Agatha had confessed to never watching SpongeBob when they were 14, how Rio forced her to binge the first five seasons on her Paramount plus account, claiming Agatha had to understand her references or they couldn’t possibly be friends.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated to admit that she liked when Rio got all excited about showing her something, like a kid getting their favorite toy, only it was Rio staring at Agatha as she watched the episode with the Hash Slinging Slasher for the first time, or forcing her to  try oysters (Rio laughed as Agatha scrunched her nose up at the texture), or, like now, playing Duck Life 4.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s swivel chair was clunky and heavy, allowing Agatha to sit in it with her legs crossed, now in a long sleeve shirt and shorts, a combo she usually detested, but she needed the chance for both cool air and coverage, not sure if the panic in her mind would trigger goose bumps or sweat. She’s trying her best to pay attention to the little duck on the screen and not Rio hovering over her. </p><p> </p><p>Her eyes have been caught on her abdomen ever since Rio had put on the cropped t-shirt, light gray and maybe a little see-through, the short sleeves barely covering her shoulders, her biceps exposed. As much as she loves Rio in a skirt, the sweatpants are hugging her hips tightly, the perfect window of skin framing her belly button. It’s a distraction. Agatha knows Rio is trying to distract her from the heaviness of the day with silly games and lighthearted conversation. But it’s another war to keep her focus on feeding and training the pixelated duck to win a race. </p><p> </p><p>“I can’t believe you missed out on club penguin,” Rio gasps, truly forlorn at the realization. “You can still play on private forums, but I feel like you’re too vulnerable right now, you might get addicted.”</p><p> </p><p>”I don’t know if I have the mental capacity for you to even explain to me what club penguin is right now,” Agatha deadpans, her fingers jamming against the left and right arrows on the old keyboard, now training the duck in climbing. </p><p> </p><p>“Just know my username was TheeGreenWitch, two E’s in thee, and two E’s in green,” she clarifies without prompting, “And I was flirting with all the other 8 year old girls.”</p><p> </p><p>”Oh, so I’m not the first girl you’ve played computer games with? Wild.”</p><p> </p><p>”Look, Rachel took my computer game virginity, but now I only want you baby,” Rio quips, Agatha losing the level as soon as the words leave her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>“Who the fuck is Rachel?” Agatha pushes back from the desk, just enough to fully face the girl standing beside her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks, allowing a moment for Agatha to stay grumpy, the wrinkle in her brow holding strong.</p><p> </p><p>”Someone I made up to make you jealous.” </p><p> </p><p>“You made my little duck die,” Agatha grumbles, the pout on her lips a mix of honesty and exaggeration.</p><p> </p><p>”So you do like this game.” Rio’s smile shifts from smug to joy, happy she’s done an even semi-adequate job at entertaining Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“Shut up”</p><p> </p><p>”Is it cliche if I say ‘make me’?” Rio leans down, bringing their faces closer together, her hands pressing into the armrests of the computer chair, sinking forward until they’re only a few inches apart. </p><p> </p><p>“Is it evil if I make you shut up by sewing your mouth shut?” Agatha asks, pretending to be unaffected by the proximity, the smile on her face a clear contrast to her words, like it wasn’t a question, but a threat, an act of violence that would bring her joy, “Would you like that, kitten?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio holds her stare, processes the words, doesn’t move back, afraid to show her cards, pushing down any semblance of a reaction.</p><p> </p><p>She swallows hard. Blinks.</p><p> </p><p>”God, you’re a freak.” Agatha laughs, pushing Rio backwards by the shoulders, breaking the closeness is just as much punishment for Rio as it is for herself, but she needs to breathe, recenter herself, take back the upper hand. </p><p> </p><p>“You’ve deprived me of this stuff for years, my daydreams have gotten a little creative,” Rio shrugs, unashamed of her desires, a carefree air that Agatha has always admired.</p><p> </p><p>”Years?” Agatha’s face curls in disgust, “I do not want to think about 14-year-old us fucking.”</p><p> </p><p>”But 17-year-old us is fine?” Rio questions, her eyebrows raised.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows Rio is joking, that as much as she wants them to get to that at some point, she isn’t pushing, isn’t actually upset at the course of their relationship, would wait forever if it meant getting just a glimpse of being their most authentic selves, loving each other to their highest capacity.</p><p> </p><p>”Rio.” Agatha still says her name like a warning, rolling her eyes for the full effect. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not hearing a no.”</p><p> </p><p>”Don’t make me choke you again.” Agatha tries to stir up all the bite she can muster.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought we already established that kitten likes that,” Rio is smiling, smug and self-assured. </p><p> </p><p>“I can’t believe I’m the traumatized one” </p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs, her eyes fighting between joy and lust. </p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Rio acts surprised, dumbfounded by reality, “I can’t believe I’m the product of loving parents either.”</p><p> </p><p>”My duck is dead.” Agatha’s voice shakes, a full performance ready, “My duck is dead, and you’re not taking it seriously.” She gestures at the computer screen ‘level failed’ staring back at her, ignoring the convenient option to replay it. </p><p> </p><p>“My sincerest apologies,” Rio clutches her non-existent pearls, “When is the funeral? I’ll make sure to send some azaleas”</p><p> </p><p>“The family is requesting 12 dozen at the very least.” Agatha crosses her arms, ready to keep the joke going, settling into her fake anger with all the dramatics of an award winning actress.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinks.</p><p> </p><p>”Azaleas kill ducks, Agatha.” Rio voices like Agatha should know better, like the fact is one of common sense, shaking her head and scoffing, a flippant portrayal of disappointment. </p><p> </p><p>“So, my duck dies. And now you’re trying to take out his entire bloodline?”</p><p> </p><p>”You’ve known that duck for 20 minutes and you’re already taking his side?” Rio lifts the back of her hand to her forehead, making a show of flailing back as if about to faint, “I thought I meant more to you than that.” Her voice on the edge of a fake sob.</p><p> </p><p>“Watch it, Vidal. That’s my son you’re talking about.” Agatha seethes.</p><p> </p><p>”You two sound like an old married couple.”</p><p> </p><p>Both girls freeze at the sound of Rio’s mother’s voice from the bedroom door. Both heads swing around to see the woman standing in the threshold, her brown eyes trace over the contents of Rio’s room: the pile of clothes on the floor (that usually find a home on the computer chair Agatha is currently sitting in), the bowl on the nightstand only holding 3-day-old dorito crumbs, the art supplies haphazardly stacked in the corner, the two teenage girls who look like they’ve just seen a ghost. </p><p> </p><p>Mrs. Vidal smiles at them as she steps into the room, it feels close to getting caught in the act even if they weren’t doing anything scandalous, fake-fighting over the fake-death of a computerized duck. </p><p> </p><p>“You scared me,” Rio confesses, thrown by her mother’s sudden appearance.</p><p> </p><p>”You were too busy yapping to hear me come up the stairs,” she laughs, “you got your big mouth from your father.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio meets her mother half way, letting her pull her into a brief hug. Agatha watches from her seat, sunken into the crisp feeling, something to treasure in the way Rio clings to her mother even now. It makes her look young, even a few inches taller than her, the embrace pulls at something warm and foreign in Agatha’s chest. It isn’t jealousy. But maybe a new truth. That this warmth could be hers too. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s family had always welcomed her, had always offered her their love and their comfort without batting an eye. Being Rio’s friend had always felt like getting a piece of the pie, fitting in with the same cherry filling. But she wanted more now, wanted to feel like she was a step in the recipe, not just an optional ingredient. </p><p> </p><p>It was insane actually, settling on that realization, that she trusted not only Rio, but her parents enough to truly let them in, to tell them the truth, to feel the full extent of their embrace. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, mija.” Mrs. Vidal steps to Agatha, caressing the back of her head in greeting, “Are you staying for dinner?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, looking to Rio for confirmation, to further explain for her, unable to use her own words to clarify, to ask for help.</p><p> </p><p>”About that,” Rio starts, her eyes settling back on her mother, a deep breath to break the tension, “Can Agatha sleep over tonight?”</p><p> </p><p>”It’s a school night, chispita” Her voice glows with maternal dismissal, a spark of questioning Rio’s intentions, the instinct to compare spontaneous sleepovers to the possibility of unplanned pregnancy, or destroyed property, or getting on the wrong side of the drug trade. </p><p> </p><p>“Please, Mami,” Rio pulls out her puppy dog eyes, an expert restraint in pout, poking her lip out just enough to make her mother feel pity, but not enough to oversell it. </p><p> </p><p>Mrs. Vidal looks between them, the seconds passing as she seems to contemplate it, seemingly weighing the pros and cons, trying to decide if she could trust her teenage daughter to make it to school on time if the two girls would definitely be staying up past 3 am.</p><p> </p><p>”Purple socks,” the code word leaves Agatha’s mouth before she can provide them with a certain answer. She’d remembered it from when Rio used it on the phone with her mother weeks ago, how it cemented that Agatha needed Rio, how no further questions were asked.</p><p> </p><p>She remembers how angry she was then, that Rio had possibly betrayed her trust, how embarrassed she was, that her parents were dragged into it too.</p><p> </p><p>The words ring now like a cry for help, a yield sign, giving them enough time to slow down and look, find the truth of Agatha’s need without telling the whole story. Now it only makes her feel warm, overwhelmed by care, that Rio had the love and forethought to create a signal for her parents to know without knowing, a way to protect her two-fold. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her like she can’t believe she used it, a small tinge of pride in her eyes, like Agatha had found some comfort in it, a way to ask for help without explicitly asking for it.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio’s mother resolves, sighing slightly at her own shift in opinion, but also noting the gravity of the situation, trying to put the pieces together, “But we're discussing this at dinner with your father.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio is still looking at Agatha, waiting for some reaction, holding her breath at the chance she might run, go back to Evanora instead of staying and explaining.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods. </p><p> </p><p>“What’s for dinner?”</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p>1 Samuel 12:24- But be sure to fear the Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re sure you wanna tell them?” Rio asks a few minutes after her mother leaves the room. Rio had offered to help cook dinner, but Mrs. Vidal had waved her off from the threshold of the door, lingering to look at between the two girls as if to tell Rio to stay with Agatha without saying the words. </p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha sighs, shaking her head, the words pointed down towards Rio, splayed out awkwardly on her bed, Agatha sat up next to her, her back pressed into the headboard, baby duck completely forgotten. “but something has to change.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio only stares from her layed position, something soft and understanding in her eyes, Agatha is still getting used to the pride directed at her in brown eyes, the calm resolute gratification. It was enough to stir the fear in Agatha’s soul, the way Rio never moved too fast to scare her, never offered empty pity or clapped loudly in response to Agatha’s growth. She knew that it made Agatha feel weak. Instead, she observed, she sat patiently, witnessing Agatha bloom over years of delicate friendship, over years of untouched feelings. But Rio couldn’t hide the satisfaction in her eyes anymore. </p><p> </p><p>It was there, and Agatha could see it. And it didn’t hurt as much as it used to. For once, she agreed that maybe Rio had something to be proud of.</p><p> </p><p>Because admitting that she wanted better for herself, that she didn’t want to live like this anymore, that she was willing to try even if she didn’t feel completely ready, wasn’t sure that there would be a better outcome, it felt like more than a baby step.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio still didn’t clap, didn’t praise her with patronizing words, just stayed with her, reached for her hand, stroked over her knuckles like a chance for stability. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe one day Agatha would feel comfortable in self celebration, and when that day comes, Rio will be waiting with the banners and the balloons, but for now she’s content to hold off, sink into what Agatha needs over what she knows she deserves. </p><p> </p><p>They sit in the silence for a few minutes, Rio’s hands playing with Agatha’s fingers, soothing yet free, a gentle caress that warps the seriousness, the warmth of Rio’s eyes undemanding. Agatha remembers that silence isn’t war. Reminds herself that there is ease in not having to fill the space, that she can relax here, that she doesn’t have to live life in the margins waiting for her savior, always on guard for the next act of violence. </p><p> </p><p>All of her life had been written by her mother, coiled up and cold. Evanora had always decided what words made it into the story, the character she was painted as. Rio had been the first person to encourage her to rip out pages, to pick up her own pen. It had happened slowly, brown eyes weaseling into her psyche through weighted gestures, and silly jokes, but what really kept Agatha held up was the unconditional presence. Agatha let Rio see all the ugly, gave her the tweezers and flashlight to pick through it, and instead of power washing out the dirt, Rio had tangled herself into the roots, had made a home in all the things Agatha thought made her unworthy, whispered strength into all the cracks until they felt like stickers instead of scars. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had never asked to change her, had never chained herself to a tree and begged Agatha to let her fix her. Not when they were fourteen and confessing acts of abuse in sleeping bags, not when Agatha was finally confessing feelings but still holding back from acting on them. </p><p> </p><p>There had always been that unspoken agreement. That Rio could hold some of the weight, cover her bruises in makeup, talk her through the darker parts, distract her from it all with ice cream and computer games. But she didn’t have the power to heal her. That was Agatha’s part. </p><p> </p><p>And now was no different.</p><p> </p><p>Rio could offer Agatha her home, her bed, a tunnel towards escape. But Agatha still had to make the choice to take it. </p><p> </p><p>Here she was. Sat in Rio’s bed, allowing Rio to spread comfort through them both, the careful press of fingertips tracing against her palm, not running, not giving in to the desire to pull away from the unconditional affection that still felt foreign even if Rio had been offering it quietly for years.</p><p> </p><p>It felt like choosing. A decision that spun the anxiety in her gut, but still settled something in her heart. Something like intuition, a sense she hadn’t recognized in a long time. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio! Agatha! Dinner!” Mr.Vidal’s voice carries from the first floor calling them downstairs. </p><p> </p><p>“Ready?” Rio sits up, perching herself on her elbows, her neck turned awkwardly to find Agatha’s eyes, still giving her an out, still masking sure this wasn’t forced, Agatha’s decision. </p><p> </p><p>“Feels like judgement day,” Agatha mumbles. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry,” Rio turns more of her body, her hand settling against Agatha’s collarbone, “The only sin you’ve committed is kissing a girl,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes at Rio’s attempt to settle her brain, her thoughts screaming out all the reasons she’s going to hell.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Honor thy father and thy mother.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Well that kind of went out the window. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushes Rio’s hand away with a quiet huff, hiding the smile that spills out at the way Rio looks at her like something worth devouring. She pushes herself up from the bed to stand, knowing without looking back that Rio is following her. </p><p> </p><p>She turns back regardless, the magnet pulling her back in, resting her forearms against Rio’s shoulders, basking in the ease of Rio’s hands finding her waist, the act starting to feel less like exploration and more like a practiced certainty. </p><p> </p><p>“Can I sin one more time before I go to hell?” Agatha asks, a clipped edge to the words like she’s not asking for a kiss in the most Agatha way possible. </p><p> </p><p>“You don’t want to ask for forgiveness instead?” Rio bites her lip for a moment, shifts her tongue in her own mouth, “There’s still time to repent.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head no, dissolving the game of teasing, sinking forward just enough to connect their lips. She finds herself reeling in the tenderness, not pushing further to up the pace, just deepening the brush of lips into something more intimate, tilting Rio’s head, her fingers caught on the back of her neck, slow and passionate. The raw desire from earlier in the bathroom isn’t there, caught somewhere in the back of her throat, instead her lips move with quiet purpose, a ‘thank you’ she can’t verbalize. </p><p> </p><p>She focuses on Rio’s breathing, the way it sags against her like a pattern of hushed treasure. The way she melts under her touch, responds with the same patient intensity. She lets Agatha lead, happy to follow. </p><p> </p><p>Downstairs Mr. Vidal smiles at her, winks like they share some secret as he hands her cups from the cabinet. Rio takes plates from him right after, a seamless process of setting the table. A practice Agatha falls into like she has so many times before. She pours water into each cup from the filtered pitcher kept in the fridge as Rio sets out napkins and grabs forks. </p><p> </p><p>A large pan of arroz con pollo sits on one of the burners of the stove, simmering slightly on low, just enough to stay warm. The cover is on, hiding the contents, the bubbles of condensations painted over the inside of the glass surface like a work of art, but Agatha recognizes the aroma, a comforting mix of spices that Evanora has never used. Beside it is another pan, a shallow bath of hot oil still cooling from frying smooshed slices of plantains, the plate of fresh tostones steaming on the counter, the grease slipping into the paper towel they’re carefully placed on. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs two of the plates, and Rio grabs the others, handing one at a time to Mrs. Vidal to transfer food onto each one, the wooden spoon scooping the chicken and rice with ease, Rio wincing as she picks at the still hot tostones with her bare hands, a common occurrence. Her father passes her a fork with a scoff, seeing himself in the act. She slides a few onto each plate with Agatha bringing each one back to the table. </p><p> </p><p>When they all sit to say grace. It doesn’t feel like grounds for a performance, the prayer never one person’s responsibility, never said out loud. Instead they join hands silently, Agatha in between Rio and her mother, her father across from her at the square table. They all bow their heads, close their eyes, say their own personal prayer, a place to express quiet gratitude, and never to be judged. </p><p> </p><p>And for the first time in a while Agatha prays. </p><p> </p><p>She’s not sure who she’s talking to, who she’s directing her thoughts at.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe God. Maybe the universe. Maybe Rio.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Thank you for this. For giving me a chance. For food. For patience. For family. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Whoever she’s speaking to. She hopes they hear it. </p><p> </p><p>They share a whispered “Amen” before diving in, the clink of Mr. VIdal’s fork hitting the plate first, no question where Rio got her insatiable appetite from. As many times as Agatha has eaten dinner in the Vidal household, the depth of flavor never fails to surprise her, like her tastebuds are waking up again, the love the food is prepared with just as clear as the memorized recipes, the way they always yielded enough to be shared. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio’s mother opens her mouth to ask how school was today it doesn’t feel like judgement day, no harrowed interrogation at the pearly gates, just care, just curiosity. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs, swallowing before she speaks, brushing it off like nothing remarkable happened today, like making out with her best friend was typical, like said best friend’s mother being a demon was normal. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can only agree with one of those things. </p><p> </p><p>“The usual.” She pushes the rice around her plate, “Brother Morales is still teaching first year stuff.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles because it’s true, amused that Rio is bothered by the repetitive curriculum, but also trying to find where to start her own truth. </p><p> </p><p>Because Rio is keeping it light, steering them away from the hard conversation, giving Agatha the opportunity to ruin dinner with her burden. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?” Her mother turns the question to her, the careful press of affection. Like Agatha was their daughter too, like they genuinely cared how her day was, how she felt. She wondered if that would ever stop feeling new. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a sip of her water, scrunches her napkin in her hands for something to do, fights the desire to reach out for Rio’s hand instead. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you alright, cariño?” Mr. Vidal asks.</p><p> </p><p>And that's the nail in the coffin.</p><p> </p><p>Proof that this family cared about her enough to recognize the warning signs, that they knew her better than her own mother, could sense the trouble from the way she blinked too hard, hesitated to speak. Because Agatha wasn’t usually scared in their presence, always found comfort in their care even when she didn’t feel like she deserved it. And now she felt overwhelmed by how easily she was being read, Rio pushing rice around her plate, her mother’s eyes watching Agatha like she was waiting to jump into protection mode, her father’s question hanging in the air like a patient void. </p><p> </p><p>She was scared. Not of being hit, not of raised voices or tainted retaliation. She was scared of hurting them, of showing her truth, of forcing them to carry the weight. Because even if they kept looking at her like something to protect, even if they said she could stay, it would never be something she could repay. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know how to begin to explain. She looks to Rio, finds strength in her eyes. For half a second, she thinks to ask her to explain for her, to spill it all to her parents while she listens, but for all the words Agatha can’t find, she knows Rio’s thoughts are even more unclear, forced to tread the line of what Agatha was okay with revealing. </p><p> </p><p>She reaches for Rio’s hand instead, a pillar of comfort, a boost over the wall. Rio gives her this, the touch of skin, hands clasped over the table like a warm confession. Rio strokes over her knuckles, nods at her slightly.</p><p> </p><p>It feels like permission, permission to open the flood gates, the freedom to speak her truth, unlock the safe she’d kept all the pain in and live with the consequences.</p><p> </p><p>”I- my mother, she,” Agatha tries, tripping over her own words, not knowing where to start. Abuse. Violence. It all feels too clinical, too simple, no words to describe it all at once, “She hits me.”</p><p> </p><p>It tumbles out like a release, an exhale, a balloon slowly losing air, no abrupt pop. Just a shaking voice that holds strong enough to keep explaining.</p><p> </p><p>She feels Rio squeeze her hand slightly, a sign that she’s still there, the motivation to keep going even if her eyes are trained down, unable to meet any of their eyes. She can feel someone shift, hear forks hit the table, the soft clink echoing like an opening for Agatha to fill.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>They’re listening. They care.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>”She um,” Agatha tries to breathe, focus on the softness of Rio’s fingers, remind herself she’s safe, “she leaves marks. Rio’s been helping me cover them for years.”</p><p> </p><p>”Rio’s been trying to get me to tell you for a long time, but I told her not to.” She continues, the shake of her voice shifting, somehow easier when she’s remembering the care of her best friend, not wanting her to shoulder any of the blame of keeping her secret when Rio was only trying to protect her. </p><p> </p><p>When no one responds, Agatha continues, spurred on by the fact that nothing bad had happened yet, the ground not opening under her and claiming her back to the dirt, no spontaneous combustion. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s been happening for a long time. Since I was really little. The beatings.” She clarifies, “Anytime I did something she didn’t like, or spoke too loud, or stayed out 5 minutes past curfew, or didn’t sit up straight enough at church, or anytime she felt like it.”</p><p> </p><p>Now that she’d started, it felt kind of cathartic, saying it out loud, tracing over it like reality, like it didn’t have to hide in the shadows, like she couldn’t protect Evanora anymore if it meant suffocating herself. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up briefly trying to gauge their reaction. Needing to be grounded somehow, a sense of reassurance. </p><p> </p><p>She isn’t expecting the silent streaks of tears falling down Mr. Vidal’s face or the way Mrs. Vidal is gripping Rio’s other hand, her eyes pained but also angry. Rio’s face is sad too, her eyes watery, but her lips flat and tight, maybe a mix of her parents. But behind it is still that undeniable pride, a proud joy a layer buried, that in this pain they find the path towards a better tomorrow, like Agatha is walking towards the light on her own.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha half-laughs, stunned into a scoff, unsure of how to process, she feels the tears on her own face suddenly, flashing back into her body, like she’d disassociated from it for a moment, only feeling Rio’s fingers, now she can feel the goosebumps rising over her legs, the way she’d shivering slightly, the cool rush of tears streaked down her cheeks. She wipes at her cheek abruptly with her sleeve, sniffles harshly. </p><p> </p><p>“Cariño, don’t you dare apologize,” Mrs. Vidal warns, but her tone is soft, no bite, just the solid weight of sympathy, finally knowing Agatha’s struggle and never giving her the opportunity to blame herself. </p><p> </p><p>“I ruined dinner,” Agatha tries to explain, her voice rough, her eyes still glassy as she meets her gaze.</p><p> </p><p>”The only thing that could ruin dinner is Papa trying to cook,” Rio inserts, lightening the mood, taking the worry from Agatha’s brain without pressing in offensive pity. </p><p> </p><p>“Aye, chispita.” Mr. Vidal kisses his teeth, unprepared for the stray bullet fired by his daughter, “That was one time.”</p><p> </p><p>”Yeah,” Rio smiles, “Cause Mami still won’t let you in the kitchen after you almost fed me undercooked chicken.”</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Vidal shakes his head, a laughing release of breath. Mrs. Vidal offers her a look like they shouldn’t get involved in this lighthearted fight, a silent agreement that the father and daughter were crazy and that had nothing to do with them.</p><p> </p><p>“Wasn’t that like years ago?” Agatha asks, “It’s not time to let it go?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s not sure why she’s on Mr. Vidal’s side, maybe trying to stay in his good graces, maybe amused by the way Rio could get so competitive and exasperated. </p><p> </p><p>“She was 6”</p><p> </p><p>”I was 6”</p><p> </p><p>They both respond at the same time, Rio sending a death glare at her father only capable from a teenage girl. </p><p> </p><p>“Too young to fend for myself.” Rio grumbles, picking up her fork again, ready to tuck back into her food now, her other hand still holding onto Agatha’s, not willing to be the one to pull away first.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries not to think about how Rio wasn’t trying to hide it, wasn’t ashamed of holding her hand in front of her parents or the assumptions that might come from it, that Rio hadn’t come out to them yet, but was willing to show them this clear picture of affection, wouldn’t let that secret stop her from supporting Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>She lets that truth wash over her, thinks about Rio, her parents, the way the world was still turning, Rio was still cracking jokes, how change hadn’t eaten her whole. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>They knew. Someone knew that wasn’t Rio, and she was still okay.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Mrs. Vidal clears her throat suddenly, putting to bed the little argument, making room for comfort. </p><p> </p><p>“You can stay here as long as you want, Agatha.” Rio’s mother finally answers the earlier question, offering more than a one night sleepover, giving it to her without having to ask, opening up their home in a more permanent sense, knowing this went beyond being seniors wanting to slack off or one night of staying up too late to function, this was seeking protection, needing somewhere to go when all of it became too much to handle, and they were leaving the door open for her. For all the sense of belonging she found in the little nicknames, joined into a culture like it was her own, the way Mrs. Vidal said her name was so grounding, a second level to the way she needed the words to be heard. It wasn’t ’as long as you need’, but ‘want’. A reminder that they wanted her here too, that she wasn’t a burden, that they’d take her in her glory and her struggle. </p><p> </p><p>“And please,” Rio’s father speaks, “If you need anything, don’t be afraid to ask.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, whispering a soft “Thank you,” even if she knows it would take life and death for her to ask for their help directly, and even then she’d hesitate. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha doesn’t want anyone else knowing,” Rio chimes in like a warning, her voice edged like a crystal clear rule, like she knows her parents will jump in to help in all the typical ways they know how, that they’d try use their power in all the ways Agatha wasn’t ready for, sweeping in to say the parts she’d forgotten, a protection that seeped from her skin like a natural barrier, “Not the police, or the school nurse, or anyone. Okay?” </p><p> </p><p>It’s a heavy ask, bringing two more people into the fold, telling them of her trauma and then promptly tying their hands behind their backs, telling them not to help her anymore than they could directly. But Rio’s voice sings like it demands respect, not just for her words, but for Agatha, a reminder that this is her life and her wishes for it matter. </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Vidal nods quickly, knowing the strength of his daughter rivals the strength of his wife, knowing not to fight her on this.</p><p> </p><p>”Mami?” Rio turns to her, needing confirmation, knowing her to be the more stubborn of the two. </p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” She relents, turning to Agatha to add, “But if you change your mind I’ve got CPS on speed dial.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s not a joke, but Agatha smiles like it is, needs to catalog it that way for now. </p><p> </p><p>It’s enough to leave like that, feeling less like an open wound and more like a bandaid pressed over it, a kiss settled over the skin, a prayer said for healing. </p><p> </p><p>Dinner isn’t ruined. If anything the salt of her tears offer more seasoning. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p>Isaiah 40:28-29 - Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the Earth. He will not grow tired or weary,  and his understanding no one can fathom. He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha helps Rio clean the dishes, mostly by leaning on the counter and watching her work. She packs away the leftovers in containers, takes an extra moment to admire how full the refrigerator is, a medley of fresh ingredients and premade food, a bag of red onions, the sugary juice Rio prefers, turkey slices from the deli that Evanora never allowed in the house. </p><p> </p><p>When she was younger, Agatha convinced herself that she must be allergic to a lot of things, that her mother was keeping her safe, that was the reason she couldn’t have soda, or candy, or anything with preservatives. It was easier that way, convincing herself that Evanora wasn’t depriving her as a means of control, that telling herself little white lies was better than facing the truth. </p><p> </p><p>But Rio had shared Skittles with her the first week she’d moved to Westview and she hadn’t died. They had met a few days earlier in school. Rio saw her that Sunday at Church, had walked up to her after mass and poured a couple into her hand like it meant nothing. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha remembers thanking God that Evanora was off somewhere talking to a priest, didn’t bear witness to the candy she was about to consume or the way Rio was already looking at her like a friend, two things she wasn’t allowed to have. </p><p> </p><p>She drank soda all that summer in Rio’s backyard with her parents, family barbecues with extended family, Rio’s father spraying them with the hose when it got too hot. Evanora was just happy to not have to look at her for 3 months.</p><p> </p><p>She tried not to think about how much Rio had done for her, gave her so many firsts, never judged her for the things she had yet to experience, just pressed in the opportunities to try new things. It was overwhelming, thinking about all the things they’d done together, all the feelings that bubbled under the surface for so long. </p><p> </p><p>They don’t say much even when Rio’s parents make their way into the living room, turn the TV up enough to not hear any conversation from the kitchen. </p><p> </p><p>“That went well,” Agatha’s hip juts into the countertop, standing close to Rio as she scrubs the last of the dishes.</p><p> </p><p>”Hmm”, Rio hums in answer, soft and contemplative.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches into the stream of water from the faucet, flicks the fist of droplets into Rio’s face, the closest she can get to checking in without voicing something too vulnerable. </p><p> </p><p>“What’s your problem?” Rio laughs, looking down at her gray crop top now pebbled in black droplets of water, her face marked too, a few drops she tries to blink out of her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“I have this condition where I can’t go too long without annoying you or I transform into a bunny,” Agatha shrugs like it’s common sense, no big deal.</p><p> </p><p>”Lucky for you, I quite enjoy cute little animals.” Rio places the last dish on the drying rack, turning to dry her hands on a towel. </p><p> </p><p>“So, I should stop annoying you?” </p><p> </p><p>“Hmm,” Rio stops, looking up in deep thought, like the choice made a big difference, “I quite enjoy being annoyed by you too, so, up to you I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>Getting ready for bed feels a little strange. Agatha had slept over before, the few times Evanora was out of town, the few times she could get away with it. </p><p> </p><p>It hadn’t happened in a while, Evanora’s leash feeling tighter than usual the last year or so, until the recent break. </p><p> </p><p>But sliding under Rio’s covers, getting comfortable against the pillow, waiting for Rio to finish brushing her teeth, it filled her with warmth, an even stream of breathing, her hair was still a little wet from the shower, her own teeth still tasted like mint, Rio’s fan blowing over her as she slid towards the wall and made room, fluffing Rio’s pillow without thought, trying to focus on the TV, a WNBA game Rio put on that Agatha could barely follow. </p><p> </p><p>“The blue team is beating the white team,” Agatha offers her insight when Rio comes back into the room, trying to press in the information as avoidance, not ready to discuss much else.</p><p> </p><p>”Thanks,” Rio chuckles as she turns off the lights, the brightness of the TV still illuminating half the room, before pulling back the blankets and sliding into bed beside her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s full-sized mattress gives them enough room to not touch, would grant them space if they wanted it. But Rio shifts towards the center of the bed, maybe out of habit, encroaching on Agatha’s side easily. Agatha faces her, eyes no longer watching the TV, the commentators’ voices, the chant of the crowd, the squeaking sneakers all falling into the background, Rio taking center stage.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand finds Rio’s hip, they both lay on their sides facing each other, her fingers keep exploring, tracing over her ribcage, feeling the heat of her skin under the old band t-shirt obviously stolen from her father’s closet, the front decal faded and chipped. She takes an extra moment to feel each jut of bone, memorize the rise and fall of her breathing. Rio’s hand sits still on Agatha’s hip, giving her the freedom to touch, to learn, to take her time. She watches her, patient as fingertips run against her shoulder, careful to avoid Rio’s chest, pressing into her collar bone, scratching slightly at the shirt collar, dragging it down enough to feel the skin over her sternum, hold steady long enough to feel the heart beating under her palm. </p><p> </p><p>She reads the hesitation in brown eyes, the holding back, the way Rio wants to feel her, learn all the curves of her skin, but waits. Gives Agatha the room to do it, but doesn’t allow her own hands to move. </p><p> </p><p>“Should we say the things?” Agatha whispers like it holds the possibilities she’s too afraid to want. An attempt at pushing them towards a conversation she knows is necessary even if she’s scared of looking her feelings in the eye. </p><p> </p><p>Because she knows her and Rio aren’t exactly friends anymore, and redefining felt like the only thing that could stop her from floating away. If they weren’t friends, they were nothing, no new words pressed in to quell the loss, and she desperately needed them to be something.</p><p> </p><p>”The things?” </p><p> </p><p>“Like feelings, things.”</p><p> </p><p>”Are you ready for that conversation?” Rio isn’t trying to be mean, truly looking for the right moment to cross this bridge, reminding Agatha that she could wait. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re too patient with me,” Agatha says instead of answering her question, like she’s mad about it, offended by how easy RIo makes everything.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t respond verbally, nods in closer giving Agatha ample time to push her away, presses a short kiss to Agatha’s lips like that’s the only necessary answer, looks at her with such gentle intensity that Agatha wants to hide, sink into the springs of the mattress and never come back, but she doesn’t have the power to transform herself into slime, so she stares back at Rio, the feeling of her lips still etched into her own. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want to make you wait forever,” Agatha whispers into the space between them, clenching at the front of Rio’s t-shirt like it grounded her, something to keep her from falling. It sings like a shamed confession, a fear she didn’t like hitting the air, a truth that told too much about how she was still afraid of Rio leaving, still afraid Rio would decide she was too much and walk away. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha. Baby,” Rio tries to comfort her, the words coated in affection, an attempt at reminding her where they were, the events of the day, the way Rio had stayed by her side waiting for years, would be stupid to walk away now when Agatha was finding her own voice. </p><p> </p><p>“I see you holding back,” Agatha accuses, her voice still small, hidden in the dim light, “You keep letting me decide and I appreciate you trying to let me figure out my own shit but…” she pauses, waiting for Rio to disagree, to tell her that what she’s witnessed over the last few weeks, over their entire friendship has ever been Rio choosing something for the both of them. “I know it hurts, swallowing your feelings, waiting for me to let you in, I don’t want to do that to you anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a moment to feel it, her hand moving up from Agatha’s hip to rest on her cheek, let her thumb graze against her jaw line, before stroking underneath her bottom lip, a space for contemplation.</p><p> </p><p>”What do you want?” Rio finally asks.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles, recognizing the patterns they’d placed themselves in, how difficult it could be to break free from what was practiced even if it no longer served them. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re doing it again,” she scoffs, her eyes blinking suddenly, her skin set on fire by Rio’s touch, unable to quiet the pulsing of her heart.</p><p> </p><p>”Doing what?” Rio smiles too, still stroking over Agatha’s chin, the light brush of her thumb enough to make her shiver.</p><p> </p><p>”Putting my wants ahead of yours.”</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha can see the dam break, the shift in brown eyes, being called out without meaning it as an attack, it still takes a moment to rewire her brain, finally catching up with the fact that Agatha wanted her to live for herself, that as much as she appreciated the love, the dedication, she wouldn’t let Rio lose herself in it. </p><p> </p><p>It felt like uncovering hidden treasure, but the gold coins stung her skin. The touch of hot metal begging to be left alone. Agatha knew it must hurt, being told that she didn’t need her, at least not in a way that made Rio feel like her loyalty to Agatha meant sacrificing her own desires, putting Agatha as her ultimate priority even if it meant holding herself back. But Agatha tried to seal the wound, pressing into Rio’s space again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kisses her, a teasing hunger that traces the movement, memorizing the way Rio’s lips respond with little prompting, the ease of conversation with no words. She tries to tell her through connected lips, the rush of tongue and teeth.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>I don’t need you to save me. But I want you to stay to see me save myself. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>As harsh as it felt, she wanted to feel the full extent of Rio’s pride casted over her, wanted Rio to let loose all the hindered coils of want, free herself from what she thought Agatha couldn’t handle. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls back, her hand still fisted in the collar of Rio’s shirt, Rio’s hand still holding her face. Brown eyes that hang dark against the low light. Blue irises catching the reflection of the TV. It feels like a stalemate, a second of recon, a moment before pressing them over the edge. </p><p> </p><p>“I want you to kiss me when you want to kiss me, touch me without waiting for permission, act on your feelings without thinking I might push you away for feeling too much” </p><p> </p><p>And maybe Rio feels the same way Agatha does when she feels like she’s being read like a book, exposed, vulnerable, not ready to give it words. </p><p> </p><p>But then Rio’s hand loses it’s cautious hesitancy, the memo surging through her like the antidote was kicking in, her fingers feel more solid, pressing Agatha’s hair behind her ear. Her eyes grow darker somehow.</p><p> </p><p>”We have school tomorrow,” Rio reminds like it’s something that slipped their minds, a warning that they can’t lost in the push and pull, that Agatha would have to stop whatever she was pushing them towards at some point, like Agatha’s words had awakened a monster and Rio would have to be restrained if Agatha wanted any sleep tonight. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods not knowing the full weight of it, not having the time to really contemplate the consequences.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushes forward again, this time at Agatha’s hips with enough strength to turn her onto her back, falling over her in the same instance.</p><p> </p><p>She reconnects their lips with no warning, taking Agatha’s consent and running with it. Agatha only knows one way to respond, grabbing hold of Rio and keeping her close, refusing to think of a reality where Rio stopped kissing her. It was an intimate clash, chests pressing together for the first time, Agatha’s nipples hardening without much contact, the pressure of Rio on top of her holding her down, was enough to make her head spin. Rio’s mouth was warm, still fresh from toothpaste, but a taste Agatha could only describe as uniquely Rio, something human and complex. She didn’t need air, didn’t need the space to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Her thumb digs into Agatha’s hip, feeling the harsh press of bone, holding her like she refused to let her slip away. Her hand trails up slightly as their legs tangle together. Agatha can’t compute all the contact at once, the intentional brush of Rio’s fingers just under her shirt, finding the soft skin of abdomen, gentle yet certain, at the same time Rio’s thigh settles between her legs, the only barrier being the pair of boxers Rio let her wear to bed. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” She breathes into Rio’s lips, feeling the wicked smile Rio presses back into her mouth, like she was getting off on suffocating her, was pleased with how much Agatha’s body screamed for her to continue. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t have room for regret, happy that Rio is taking what she wants, loving every second of the show of desire, only mad at the way she’s struggling to conceal her own want. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand travels higher under her shirt, scratching above her belly button, searching for somewhere to sink her nails into. The harsh press of nails sends Agatha’s hips off the bed, an ache to be closer, the involuntary arch of her back, her core seeking friction without conscious thought. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitches, pausing the kiss for just a second, it’s long enough for Rio to mark a different path, reclaiming Agatha’s neck with her lips. She kisses over her throat, licks over her pulse, nibbles on her skin, firm enough to feel, but not enough to leave a mark. </p><p> </p><p>She slides her hand into Rio’s hair, doing her best to keep it out of her face, give her all the space to kiss her neck without it getting in the way, she clenches around a handful, suddenly reminding herself to not hold back either, remembering the way Rio’s eyes darkened at being choked, hoping this pain leveled the same reaction. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls Rio’s hair just enough for her to feel it, her other hand clenched around her back, keeping her close, not letting her escape. Rio groans instantly, the vibration of it pressed into Agatha’s pulse. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hips jump again, Rio’s thigh more solidly against her. They gasp together. </p><p> </p><p>A second of clarity that seems to sober them both. </p><p> </p><p>Rio pushes up onto her forearms, head held high enough to peer down at Agatha, meet her eyes with her own. Rio’s eyes are dark, her eyelids heavy, her lips slightly swollen. Agatha’s hands are still on her shoulders, but her touch is less painful, no longer pressing in heavily. She can see the way they move from Rio still catching her breath, can feel the way her own body shifts trying to catch her own. </p><p> </p><p>She searches Rio’s eyes, using one hand to brush the hair out of her face, the other still held over her shoulder, grounding, solid. </p><p> </p><p>Rio curls forward, meeting Agatha in a short peck.</p><p> </p><p>”We have school tomorrow,” she repeats, this time as a mumble into Agatha’s chin, like a child frustrated they have to wait another year for birthday cake, suddenly impatient in the wake of being responsible, wanting to keep kissing Agatha, wanting to let it unravel into whatever Agatha would allow, but also knowing they should probably wait to cross that line, that they needed to sleep, that they had forever to explore this slowly. </p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Agatha offers, understanding the full meaning without need for explanation.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s body weight settles against her, relaxed, her face pressed into her collarbone, her arms slung around her without thought. Agatha’s arms wrap around her like a teddy bear, rubbing Rio’s back to calm them both. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t want to stop in the moment, the yelling voice in her brain thundering in the aftermath. Words that turned themselves into weapons under her skin. Warnings of sin, the things she couldn’t take back once she crossed those lines. The blooming fears of being inexperienced, of making a fool of herself, of messing this up.</p><p> </p><p>They still didn’t have a label. She realizes when Rio’s breathing evens out, just as she finds sleep. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns her head back to the TV, careful not to disturb the girl currently using her as a body pillow, the blue team still beating the white team. </p><p> </p><p>It feels like a sign that not everything has to change. </p>

<p>Genesis 3:15- And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel. </p><p> </p><p>Rio should be an FBI agent. At least Agatha thinks so. She could be infinitely meticulous about innocuous things, working on the same details of a painting for hours, remixing colors several times over to achieve the right shade. She’d organized her book shelf like a snobby librarian. She was able to compartmentalize well, separate hard stuff from the overarching positivity, knew when to focus, when to goof around. Look for the little details, but never forget the big picture.</p><p> </p><p>Walking into school the next morning feels like a secret mission. A carefully calculated plan that Rio had concocted. When she woke up an hour earlier, Rio was sat up in bed, writing in her journal profusely, a list of possible courses to take, an analysis of potential scenarios, the pros and cons listed for each one. Agatha thought that if she let her stew any longer, she’d find Rio pasting pictures to the wall, using red string like she was trying to solve a murder, taping up all the evidence to see more clearly. </p><p> </p><p>They agreed to stick together as much as possible. That Rio would walk her to the two classes they didn’t share even if it made her late. Agatha was to text Rio immediately if she was summoned to the office again, and in the event that she couldn’t text her in front of Valentina, Rio had given her a note to slip to Jen, a request to text Rio ‘SOS’. Worst case scenario, Rio had been working on a pitch to convince Agatha to just walk out of school, avoid Evanora at all costs, stop the cycle even if it meant setting off the alarm from an emergency exit. </p><p> </p><p>Not knowing made her anxious, but it made it less harrowing to have a semblance of a plan, that Rio was doing the overthinking for her, seeing her put the effort in, the physical desire to validate her fears, it made her shiver. </p><p> </p><p>She was surprised that Evanora hadn’t called her, hadn’t demanded she returned last night in a text message, hadn’t sent out a search party. Agatha had no false beliefs that her mother wanted to keep her safe anymore, knew that all of it was a means of control. But a part of her shrivels at the way Evanora’s anger doesn’t seem passionate anymore either, that it didn’t rage loud enough to force her back into her grasp. </p><p> </p><p>They get to school on time, Rio purposely getting them there about 5 minutes early, just enough time for Agatha to get her books from her locker, no time to linger, no time to worry about things going wrong. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath, reminding herself that Rio is beside her, she doesn’t need to be scared. It felt like crossing a bridge, the wood falling off beneath her feet, running as fast as she could to save herself from the impact of the water. But she isn’t running fast enough, making the decision to save herself, but knowing that the storm is still chasing her, that her mother wouldn’t simply give up, that there were more waves on the horizon. </p><p> </p><p>The new reality grates at her nerves, how each attempt at abuse felt harsher now, weighed heavier when she knew she wanted better, when she was finally pulling off her rose-colored glasses, resolving herself to face this without diminishing the impact. Truth be told, the slap in the office yesterday was far from the worst she’d ever endured, but it seared into her against the most hateful words Evanora had ever casted on her, it organized itself among memories of bruises that lasted weeks, the pain of a broken pinky finger that went untreated until Rio bent it straight, taped tightly to her ring ringer. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe because of the way her mother looked at her, a flash of unbridled anger, the way she had tangible evidence now that Agatha was a sinner, going to hell, too evil to save. Kissing Rio, loving Rio. Whatever Wanda had told her. It was something Evanora would never accept, a truth that swung harsher than anything Evanora saw as ungodly before. </p><p> </p><p>And still, Agatha’s gut reaction seeks to apologize, to placate her mother’s feelings, sink to her knees and beg for forgiveness, knowing that it’s the only way to keep her. It wouldn’t change Evanora’s mind, wouldn’t cause any less abuse, because Evanora didn’t pull her punches, didn’t stop until she saw blood. But it gnawed at Agatha’s guilt a little less, hoping God would hear her begging, that He would know she wasn’t evil, the pull towards reconciliation still etched into her soul.</p><p> </p><p>It would be it’s own battle to convince herself that she had done nothing wrong, that she never deserved this, that it wasn’t her fault. </p><p> </p><p>For now, she’ll bite down the ‘sorry’ that lives on the tip of her tongue, she’ll breathe, she’ll look at Rio like a special agent, a bodyguard, an emotional support companion.</p><p> </p><p>It’s Wednesday. She reminds herself. Two more days. And then the weekend. A safe place to hide. </p><p> </p><p>They make it through all of first period without any interesting interruptions, it’s enough time to refocus, to settle into the heaviness of the day, for her guard to fall slightly, relax into it. </p><p> </p><p>But seeing Wanda in the hallway between classes shatters the carefully placed security. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had sort of forgotten. Crushed into a new reality where Evanora knew, where she was suddenly changing the rules, taking the abuse inside the school, offering Rio full transparency, and swimming in the pool of affection laid out for her. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda hadn’t been the biggest monster in her brain yesterday, overshadowed by the intensity of everything else. </p><p> </p><p>But the rage surges as soon as she sees the flash of her hair, the cold stare of green eyes. It’s freeing, remembering how anger feels as it courses through her. It crackles under the surface, but does not break, she clenches her teeth, holds tighter to her text book, but she does not move to fight. Her central nervous system still relearning how to navigate her fight or flight reaction, instead electing the freeze option, paralyzed by her rage here, the same way she is by her fear under Evanora’s violence. </p><p> </p><p>Perception shifts, the panic attack creeping up as Rio continues walking, Wanda walking in their direction, but not with them as her destination, simply passing in the hall, her head down. She tries to focus on her breathing, tries to speak, do something to get Rio’s attention, tell her to wait for her to catch her breath. It doesn’t work, the world shifting into slow motion, the colors feeling more crisp, the hallway feeling warmer than usual. </p><p> </p><p>She tries to claw her way out, strip herself of all the layers of trauma, remembers all the lives she has yet to experience. But everything feels so loud, too present, an overwhelming heightened observation like her body had forgotten to perform all of it’s involuntary processes in favor of using 100% of her brain to stop herself from collapsing.</p><p> </p><p>Blue eyes stick to the veins on the back of Rio’s hand, the display of greenish blue lines free to see as she grips the front of Wanda’s shirt, pushes her backwards. They’re face to face now. Rio and Wanda. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s eyes read fear, widened and unsure, eyebrows curling in. But Rio’s anger is quiet, no ripple of screams or harsh demands, but brown eyes show determination. She keeps Wanda against the lockers, both hands firm against her shoulders, a grip that allows escape, but doesn’t lie about it’s intentions. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s speaking into Wanda’s face, but Agatha can’t hear it. The chatter of the hallway, the cotton in her ears blocking it out. She feels like she’s in a fish bowl, condemned to never know the outside world. </p><p> </p><p>Her nervous system curls in on itself once more, a stark reaction to the way Rio’s jaw tightens, the way Wanda shrinks, the parallel of all the pain she’s felt painted in front of her with a new light, different actors in the same roles.</p><p> </p><p>She’s not sure if it’s fight or flight, but her feet press her forward suddenly, a floating feeling at the way she glides over tile in a flourish. She doesn’t remember taking the steps, launched forward to Rio’s side like teleportation, like the movie was being shot from a different angle, a continuity error in the way she was closer now. </p><p> </p><p>A few other students flank them, a small commotion now, trying to separate the two girls, stop the dramatics of a high school fight. As Agatha joins them the rest of their peers seem to take notice, a crowd forming around them, an innate need to catch a glimpse of whatever was about to go down between Rio (someone who tended to get along with everyone) and Wanda (the most devout of them, seemingly able to rile Rio up). </p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” the crack in her voice barely reaches over the jeering of the crowd as she pushes through to be close enough to touch her. Rio’s shoulder is rigid under her fingertips, sharp and flexed, “Let her go.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t fight her on it, hesitates for about half a second, a flash of confusion at the way Agatha’s voice peaked in something she couldn’t read. It wasn’t fear. It was exhaustion. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands leave Wanda’s shoulders. Agatha can see the muscles in her shoulders rest, holding intense eye contact with Wanda for an extra second, a silent warning that she was not offering her forgiveness, simply following Agatha’s wishes. </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t look at Agatha, can’t face her. She turns and walks away. Agatha looks at Wanda now, flashes through all the emotions she’s supposed to feel, but she can’t bless it with any words, she hoped Wanda could understand what she herself didn’t know how to label. </p><p> </p><p>She follows after Rio, pushing through the crowd, leaving the swarm of teenage girls with no answers, no explanation, no show. Her feet trace the pattern of Rio’s footsteps, losing her in the sea of people, but knowing where she’s headed without thinking about it too hard. </p><p> </p><p>It’s cool outside. A light drizzle. Agatha shivers against the gust of Spring wind, her body still warm from the events that had just occurred inside. She knows the side door locks automatically from the inside when it closes, knows she’ll have to walk to the front to get back inside. </p><p> </p><p>A part of her never wants to return, contemplates dropping out with the last few months of her senior year left. Dreams up a life where she could couch surf, get a job, escape Evanora and all the hurt that came with being in her proximity.  </p><p> </p><p>But her mind can’t stray for long, focused on finding Rio, on making this all okay. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s form comes into view as she takes a few steps forward, she’s slouched forward, sitting on an old bench on the side of the school. They’d discovered it early in their Sophomore year and claimed it as their own. It was seldom used by anyone else, placed in a strange area, the section of school that existed first, before the several expansions to the building. The metal is rusting, the black paint chipping away. A small dedication, a plaque barely readable ‘In memory of’ and a name they can’t read, letters they can’t agree on. Overgrown grass around it, the view from it- gray sky and singing clouds.</p><p> </p><p>In loving memory- a person meant to be remembered who they’d never know the name of.</p><p> </p><p>It reminds her of idle conversations, laughing at the absurdity of their teachers, sharing snacks, hiding away here in each other’s company, never needing a reprieve from her favorite person. </p><p> </p><p>She stops a few feet away, unsure if Rio knows she’s there, wanting to commit the image to her memory. Rio here, trapped in thought, eyes trained on the gravel, biting at her lips nervously, her knee shaking.</p><p> </p><p>”I wasn’t gonna hit her.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice holds some anger, but it swells in a cautious burst, trying her best to manage the feelings, pushing them into the conversation without any small talk, no easing in. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha wants to reassure her, tell Rio that she knows she wouldn’t do that. But her brain isn’t being rational. She couldn’t allow that. Even if she knows Rio isn’t a violent person, even if the chance was resting at 0.005%, she needed it to be zero. </p><p> </p><p>“It wasn’t about that,” Agatha finally brings herself into view, sits next to Rio, studies the side of her face, brown eyes still refusing to meet blue. </p><p> </p><p>“I was just trying to protect you,” Rio squeaks in an attempt to defend herself, all touches of anger gone, a breath away from a sob. It feels like pleaful remorse, not an excuse. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand lands over Rio’s knee, an effort to soothe, quiet the nervous shaking. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not mad,” Agatha shakes her head, her voice slow, honest. </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t answer, but her breaths seem more steady after that, like she’s returning back to reality, silencing the demons in her own mind. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe this was a little more foreign for Agatha, figuring out how to comfort Rio, she wasn’t sure if she was doing a good job. But the thing that she cherished most about Rio was her presence, the fact that she was always there, unconditional. She thought at the very least, she could manage to do the same. </p><p> </p><p>They sit in the quiet for a moment, filing through the sound of light rain, the cold metal of the bench pressed into the back of her thighs, the warmth of Rio’s thigh under her hand, the smooth skin as she strokes it with her thumb unconsciously. The quiet contemplation in furrowed eyebrows, the way Rio stares forward, lost in the concrete. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck Wanda,” Agatha grumbles, breaking Rio from her staring contest with the ground. She finds blue eyes, a complex swirl reflected back in the brown. </p><p> </p><p>“But mostly fuck Evanora,” she continues. </p><p> </p><p>She readjusts herself on the bench, moving closer, her free hand coming to wrap around Rio’s back, her head falling onto her shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry if I scared you,” Rio apologizes, her voice hushed into the small space between them, “The last thing I want is for you to look at me and think I’m anything like your mother.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio had finally said it out loud, the reason why it stung harder than they’d like to admit, the reason Agatha couldn’t let Rio punish Wanda.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>If Rio hit Wanda, how was she any different than Evanora?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Wanda was a victim in this too. A carefully placed bomb by a master manipulator waiting to erupt. Evanora had preyed on Wanda, used her vulnerability against her, knew that Wanda was doing what she thought was right, even if it was hard to agree with. </p><p> </p><p>“You could never be like her,” Agatha whispers, sliding further into the embrace, wanting to kiss Rio. The consequences feeling small. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, her eyes still coated in a layer of sadness. </p><p> </p><p>“We’ve been fighting a lot lately,” Rio turns forward again, picking at a stray thread on Agatha’s sleeve, a confession of insecurity even if not expressed that way, Agatha can tell.</p><p> </p><p>”Feels like figuring things out to me.”</p><p> </p><p>”I’ve never felt closer to you,” Rio babbles, adding it like it's a valid form of evidence, a supporting piece to Agatha’s words.”So, I guess that’s a plus.” Like she’d forgotten why they had somehow gotten closer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reminds her, pressing a soft kiss into Rio’s laugh line, loving every delicate nuance of her face, appreciating the closeness to her lips without sealing it completely. </p><p> </p><p>“If this is how you wanna fight for the rest of our lives, I would be so down for that.” Agatha doesn’t mean for it to sound like a promise. But the weight of it isn’t something that makes her recoil. Rio breaths out, something akin to a chuckle, a smirk that doesn’t reach all her features. She can’t bring herself to regret it.</p><p> </p><p>“You really couldn’t find a better place to propose?” Rio jokes, pressing in some lightness. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s our bench,” Agatha defends herself as if Rio was actually calling her romance into question, “The venue is perfect.”</p><p> </p><p>”Whoever this bench was dedicated to is probably rolling in her grave. Poor lady is screaming slurs from the beyond.”</p><p> </p><p>”And how do we know it’s a woman?” Agatha asks, wondering when Rio had decided that, usually sharing their bench donor conspiracy theories with each other. </p><p> </p><p>“No one remembers men lovingly.”</p><p> </p><p>It makes Agatha laugh, a quiet snort she can’t cover. Because Rio’s quips always fall free so easily. Words that find a home in Agatha’s heart, for all her attempts to make her laugh, for all the joy Rio pressed in right next to the tragedy. </p><p> </p><p>“What about your dad?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio purses her lips, mulling it over, like she’d seriously forgotten his existence. </p><p> </p><p>“The exception that proves the rule,” she settles on after a moment, a quiet smile returning to her face, “Mami had to whip him into shape for years before she agreed to go out with him.”</p><p> </p><p>”He told me it was love at first sight.” Agatha supplies, still trying to put the story together.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head, scoffs, licks her lips as if to say ‘of course he said that’.</p><p> </p><p>”Maybe for him,” Rio adds.</p><p> </p><p>”I mean your mom is super hot”</p><p> </p><p>Rio squints at her, wondering how they got here. </p><p> </p><p>“What? It’s true. You can’t be mad. You look just like her.” Agatha tries to defend herself, shaking Rio’s arm to get her to stop looking at her like that. </p><p> </p><p>“Anyway,” Rio pulls her arm out of her grasp, wrapping it around Agatha’s shoulders, keeping her close. “they were actually friends for years. Met through mutual friends. He asked her out once and she said no. He respected that, stayed her friend for like 2 years of her being engaged to someone else.”</p><p> </p><p>”So, we could have had a world without a Rio Vidal?” Agatha mumbles, unsure if it's a joke. </p><p> </p><p>“I guess,” Rio chuckles.</p><p> </p><p>”So, what changed?” Blue eyes look up to find brown, search her face for the answers. </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a breath before recounting the rest, like she’d been there to experience it, hearing it so many times as a child, the love story of her parents, her own origin story. </p><p> </p><p>“Mami got really sick for a while, doctors couldn’t figure out what it was, but she was bedridden, always running a fever. And I guess my dad would show up to the hospital or her apartment with their friends. But then he started showing up alone, bringing her soup, replenishing her tissue supply, sitting with her for hours. She said she started to see him differently.” She finishes with a shrug.</p><p> </p><p>”He took care of her,” Agatha whispers, something reminiscent.</p><p> </p><p>”Hmm,” Rio hums, “Think it took like 2 more years for them to actually date though.”</p><p> </p><p>”Being a loser runs in the family, I see,” Agatha tries to hold back the smile, unable to keep the amusement out of her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t seem offended, happy to be called a loser in this instance. </p><p> </p><p>“We’re just powerless against beautiful women,” She corrects the statement lightly, pressing a kiss into Agatha’s cheek. </p><p> </p><p>“Did they ever figure out what was going on with your mom?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head. Her face still tucked close into the side of Agatha’s face, her nose brushing against her cheek bone with the movement. “No. Maybe just God trying to bring them together.” </p><p> </p><p>A moment passes, the calmness settling over them, the tangent leaving space to process the morning.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m sorry I didn’t plan ahead about Wanda,” Rio’s voice is quiet, still close to her ear.</p><p> </p><p>”We can’t plan for everything.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha answers, a sting that reminds her of her own guilt, of the way she’d tried to wait for perfect moments when time continued spinning over all her delicate plans. She could never blame Rio, she knew her heart, the soft empathy that radiated out of her like a spell of protection. </p><p> </p><p>“We should get to class,” Rio opens her mouth again, another press of her lips to Agatha’s cheek, always the one trying to do the right thing even if she wanted to stay here forever. </p><p> </p><p>The sky seems to agree with her, the drizzle morphing into something heavier, the rain suddenly falling harder. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll race you,” Rio whispers into her ear, smug and certain she has the upper hand. </p><p> </p><p>Rio pushes off the bench in a poised surge, grabbing her backpack off the ground and swinging it over her shoulder in the same second, moving as fast as she can.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t move yet, waits for Rio to take her first stride before rising to her feet.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk is already there, sure she’s going to win, but before she can cement any space between them, Agatha grabs her by the backpack, pulls her backward.</p><p> </p><p>It’s rough and startling, something Rio isn’t expecting as she falls into Agatha’s strength, her body turning to catch itself. </p><p> </p><p>But Agatha catches her instead. Molding into her, kissing her softly, their lips finding a slow rhythm as Agatha holds onto her tightly, doesn’t let her run. She feels Rio’s hands on her hips, knows the game is over, Agatha has won.</p><p> </p><p>She waits for the rain to become a little heavier, the sound crushing into her ears, their hair and uniforms growing wet before she pulls away. She revels in the way she’s able to take Rio’s breath away, takes note of the desire in brown irises, before pushing her away swiftly and turning around, running full speed to the front entrance. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Rio calls from behind her, trying to catch up, her heart racing from more than just the cardio, “That’s cheating.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha only laughs, pushes herself to run faster.</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Numbers 14:18- The Lord is long suffering and abundant in mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but He by no means clears the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation. </p><p> </p><p>Her skirt is damp. Her hair still sticking to her neck. </p><p> </p><p>They’ve been in English class for fifteen minutes, Sister Hart only shaking her head at them as they arrived late to class. </p><p> </p><p>The quiet shame from the nun was nothing in comparison to the empty seat in the front of the room, a desk usually occupied by Wanda Maximoff. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s jaw is tight, an exterior she’s trying to portray as calm, but Agatha can read through it. The weight of it rips through her, the pain reflected in brown eyes, all because of her.</p><p> </p><p>It almost feels like the devil on her shoulder laughing, telling her ‘I told you so,’ because she knew this would happen, knew that letting Rio in solved nothing, only brought Rio pain, showed her the full truth of what she was going through. And now it wasn’t Rio carrying the weight for her, it was Rio’s burden too. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>She hated it.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hated seeing Rio sling back and forth between trying her best to keep it together and putting on a mask. It felt cruel. The way Agatha only seemed to be getting better to Rio’s detriment. It went back to the conversation they’d had by the swings that day at church, that change would come and they had no power to stop it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio turns her head to check on her, finds blue eyes in an instant. She wears a reassuring smile, something small but sincere, saving Agatha from all the scarce glory, offers her a gift in the way Rio can still force happiness onto her features. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes flick around her face, drag over the delicate curves. Agatha tries to erase all the evidence of her own fear, push away the tension in her own jaw, relax her eyebrows. </p><p> </p><p>Brown eyes squint for a moment, a new thought. She pulls the black hair tie off her wrist and offers it to Agatha without a word. </p><p> </p><p>It collapses the moment into a careful snapshot, a second in time where one friend could offer another a small favor. An enormous condition of their relationship being the unspoken instances of care. Agatha didn’t need to ask, Rio always showed up. Rio didn’t need to say she was happy, or sad, or scared, Agatha could always see it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes it, ties her hair into a low ponytail, the cool air on her neck, making it easier to self-regulate, less overwhelmed by the soggy state of her clothes, trying to breathe. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Because where the fuck is Wanda? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t bring herself to ask the follow-up questions. To wonder about exact consequences, to use the rest of her energy to worry. </p><p> </p><p>It seemed she’d passed the anxiety bug to Rio instead, could sense it in the way Rio’s knee bounced under her desk, the way she wasn’t doodling in her notebook, holding her pen too hard, zoning out. Brown eyes that kept tracing back to the same empty seat. </p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck</em>. </p><p> </p><p>There was a part of Agatha that wanted to run. Her mother’s voice in her head reminding her that she isn’t special, that she brings evil wherever she goes, that Rio would be better off if she just left. It was crushing, knowing that she’d never wanted to run away to protect herself, that she’d always stayed with Evanora, prayed away the pain but never just left with a duffle bag and a dream. But now that it was hurting someone else, Rio, the only good she could trust, she found herself wanting to flee. </p><p> </p><p>She was ruining her. Corrupting her affectionate nature, pulling at threads that the Vidals had carefully woven for almost 18 years. It made her want to close the curtain, pretend this never happened, sink back into the life that had Agatha on the receiving end of the pain, and Rio at arms length.</p><p> </p><p>Even if it meant never kissing her, never loving her. Maybe that was better than breaking her. </p><p> </p><p>The familiar rhythm of heels on tile stretches closer and closer until Valentina is standing in the threshold of the door. Her eyes trace from Sister Hart over the classroom of students, surveying, seeking someone in particular. </p><p> </p><p>It feels like deja vu. Only Rio is beside her and their vice principal’s eyes hold something more serious, a clear indication that the woman knows something. </p><p> </p><p>“Ms. Vidal,” Valentina speaks as Sister Hart pauses her lesson, her eyes holding a calculated press of anger, “Principal’s office. Now.”</p><p> </p><p>They hadn’t planned for this either. Rio being the one summoned into Evanora’s dungeon.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries not to spiral back into another panic attack, clenches her fists in her lap, her nails digging into her palms, doing her best to hold back the tears of frustration, her life feeling more and more like a never ending obstacle course. </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t look at her at first. Simply nods at Valentina, before putting her notebook and pen into her bag, throwing it over her shoulder with ease. An attempt at displaying calm, it throws Agatha off for a moment, thinking she’d unknowingly trained Rio into being able to hide her emotions, the guilt of making Rio feel like she had to press down any romantic feelings for years, the way she’d given Rio access to her trauma, but never allowed her to help her out of it, only gave her the freedom to help her hide it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice comes through a moment later, a whisper just for Agatha, the squeak of it is anything but controlled, the crease of emotion clearly present. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s gonna be okay”</p><p> </p><p>And then she walks away, follows Valentina like she’s on her way to the gallows, her head still held high in protest. </p><p> </p><p>It only takes 30 seconds for Agatha to give up on staying put, the shattering truth of Rio gone, the drowning course of Sister Hart’s voice pressing back in. She thinks to ask to use the restroom, make up some excuse to leave, find any reason to not be trapped here. But she never raises her hand, the words don't come. </p><p> </p><p>She grabs her things, shuffles her binder into her bag without regard for the noise it makes.</p><p> </p><p>”Agatha,” Alice’s voice clips through the air, a sharp whisper from a few seats away, “You okay?”</p><p> </p><p>She only meets the concern in Alice’s eyes for a fraction of a second, can’t meet the emotion without falling, knows that it’s too much to take other people’s pity, that she doesn’t deserve it. She shakes her head no, her eyes still cast down, before closing her bag, pushing up from her desk and stomping out of the classroom without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>”Ms. Harkness.” She can hear Sister Hart call after her, but it clings to her brain like an afterthought, a boomerang that she sends back, can’t grasp.</p><p> </p><p>It weighs on all the shadows of expectation. The principal’s daughter causing a scene, leaving class without permission, making whatever was already going on worse. She couldn’t bring herself to care about what it meant, what her classmates would inevitably gossip about her, what Evanora would do to her when she found out, God’s disappointment. All she cared about right now was making sure Rio was okay.</p><p> </p><p>She walks towards the main office, knowing she’s only about 2 minutes behind them. Her thoughts come in clear for the first time all day, contemplating her options. Running isn’t one of them. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries to gauge what might be happening behind those walls, the words of vitriol, if Evanora is using her fists. The rational part of her brain knows her mother still has a reputation to protect, that laying a finger on anyone but her daughter would be a consequential miscalculation, that Rio had parents that would fight for her. That even if Evanora was powerful and well connected, the Vidals still had the means to blemish her perfect image. </p><p> </p><p>Barging in wouldn’t help, Agatha decides. Save them both from the added pressure, especially when Agatha doesn’t know how her mother is spinning this. </p><p> </p><p>She waits instead, pacing in the corner, out of sight in the hallway a safe distance away. She keeps looking at her phone, trying to gauge the passage of time, the reflection of numbers only making her more anxious as she never turns away from the office, willing Rio to come out unharmed. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe Agatha is a witch.</p><p> </p><p>Because Rio steps through the threshold a second later, a mix of something in her eyes as she turns to walk away, seemingly still in one piece. </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t see Agatha, the girl out of view. Agatha opens her phone frantically, not wanting to yell Rio’s name, or chase after her, afraid of being seen in front of the office, afraid of alerting her mother of her presence.</p><p> </p><p>’turn around’ she texts Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She watches as the brunette fishes her own phone out of her pocket, reads the text before swinging her body around, her eyebrows raising like she’d just won a prize as her eyes fall on Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>The relief seems to wash over them both, Rio jogging towards her like long lost lovers finally reunited. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you okay?” Agatha asks as both hands settle around Rio’s face, caressing her cheeks like she needs to feel her, know without a doubt that she’s real. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods into her hands, presses their foreheads together for a moment, seeks out the connection just as harshly. Her hands latching onto Agatha’s wrists as they breathe in the same air.</p><p> </p><p>”What did she do?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands let go, instigate some space, one moves to press out of Agatha’s grasp, the left interlacing their fingers, the right pulls a pink paper from her pocket. </p><p> </p><p>“We’ll I’m suspended for three days for ‘instigating a physical altercation on school property’,” Rio reads from the official document, rolling her eyes as a sigh leaves her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha hums, trying to comfort her, trying to press away all the callous intrusions.</p><p> </p><p>”It’s okay,” Rio squeezes her hand, “it’s not your fault.”</p><p> </p><p>”Your parents.”</p><p> </p><p>”I’m not worried about that right now.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her for a moment, taking space to process the information, Evanora hadn’t touched her, hadn’t done any irreparable harm, three days, they could get through that. </p><p> </p><p>“She’s trying to separate us,” It leaks from Agatha’s mouth like a sad epiphany, an idea not worth celebrating. </p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Rio nods. She stops for a moment, holding back her words, hesitating like it’s second nature. She opens her mouth again, like she’d resolved herself to say it all out loud, like she was following Agatha’s wishes from the night before, not holding back anymore, “You should come with me.”</p><p> </p><p>She can’t.</p><p> </p><p>”I can’t”</p><p> </p><p>”Agatha. Please.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t stand the way Rio’s voice broke, the solid swirl of tears waiting to fall, the loose hold she had left of her resolve. It broke her heart. </p><p> </p><p>She pulls her hand out of Rio’s grasp feeling the burn of the way they fit together so perfectly, the way touching Rio had always felt right. </p><p> </p><p>The weight of it is too heavy. She turns and walks away, a huff on her lips as she can no longer hold in the emotion, her feet feel heavy. But she knows Rio is following.</p><p> </p><p>”Where are we going?” Rio asks, unwilling to believe that Agatha could leave her behind now. It stings again, knowing Rio has this image of her, that Agatha knows the ugly truth. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>This isn’t running away.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She knows it would only hurt Rio more. </p><p> </p><p>Still, she can’t answer out loud, just keeps walking forward to the front exit of the building, through the parking lot towards Rio’s car. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Take me home. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She thinks, but doesn’t say, her throat feeling coated in thorns, unable to open her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio seems to understand. Turns the key in the ignition, shuffles a playlist called ‘sad boy hours’, and pulls out of the parking lot. </p><p> </p><p>They don’t speak as they drive, the silky sounds of ‘The Night We Met’ coasting through the car as Agatha feels the tears finally fall. </p><p> </p><p>She turns her head, tries to cover the sniffle, face the window, hide. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand settles on her thigh, the quiet presence, the unconditional warmth. Rio knew her too well. She couldn’t hide. Rio didn’t want her to face any of it alone, and yet, sharing it only made her feel more guilty. </p><p> </p><p>The solidity of her made Agatha feel unworthy, like she’d been an imposter, creating some image of herself in Rio’s head that wasn’t real, cloaking all her failures enough to convince Rio that she was good. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>But Agatha knew herself. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She let’s Rio keep her hand there, unsure which would be worse. </p><p> </p><p>Barely waits for them to pull into Rio’s driveway, opens the passenger side door and gets out of the car, leaves Rio to survive in her absence. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t look at her. Stands by the front door, waiting for Rio to unlock it and let them inside. Rio doesn’t seem to be in any rush, not disturbed by the cold shoulder, eased in the quiet, more comfortable in Agatha’s chaos, than the unknowns of her high school hallways. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha kicks off her shoes by the door, takes the stairs to get to Rio’s bedroom, doesn’t check behind her. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe this was a mistake. Nowhere to hide. </p><p> </p><p>She rubs her hands down her face, paces around the room, rips the hair tie out of her hair, needs to scratch her hands through it. She pulls at the hem of her shirt, roughly guides it over her head, needed to free herself of it. </p><p> </p><p>“Stop,” Rio’s voice comes from behind her, suddenly present again. </p><p> </p><p>She walks through the threshold of the door as Agatha turns to look at her, confront the command, the anger and frustration mounting, tired of wading and wanting to swim. She regrets taking off her shirt, knowing her chest and neck we’re probably showing red. </p><p> </p><p>Rio holds two water bottles, a bowl of purple grapes (the ones Agatha prefers). The items become a second thought, tossed onto the bed, a couple of grapes jostling onto the blankets.</p><p> </p><p>Rio enters her space with certainty, grabs onto her wrists, holds her arms down at her sides, doesn’t allow Agatha the room to break, holds her together, keeps her from losing herself entirely.</p><p> </p><p>”Stop,” Rio says again, this time whispered against Agatha’s lips, a quiet plea, the same conviction, her eyes closed, her breath uneven, keeping herself intact as well. </p><p> </p><p>“it’s all my fucking fault,” Agatha pulls away, Rio lets her. Never about control, never forcing. “I fucking- fuck. I don’t want to do this anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice is loud, the tears falling freely now, she knows she looks like a mess, her hair everywhere. She can’t look at Rio, can’t feel her affection without wanting to disappear, knowing all the pain she’d caused, the guilt making her itchy. </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t speak, but Agatha can still feel her watching her unravel. </p><p> </p><p>“I can’t- I can’t keep hurting you Rio.” Agatha sobs, shaking her head, “It’s fucking killing me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio had never seen her like this before. Distraught, yelling. Unchecked, free from the consequences of her emotions. Just feeling them. Expressing them. </p><p> </p><p>No one had ever seen her like this. </p><p> </p><p>Always tethered to the heavy expectations, a leash tight around her neck.</p><p> </p><p>Rio steps closer, undeterred. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want you to comfort me.” Agatha lies, not being able to handle Rio touching her, not wanting to concede so easily. </p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t expect the hopeful tilt to Rio’s face when she finally looks up, the way that same pride sings in brown eyes a few layers down. Rio looks sad, a witness to the harsh mix of emotions, knows the feeling must press into Agatha’s heart, the way its bursting out without a seatbelt shielding them from the crash.</p><p> </p><p>But, there’s something else there too. A knowing. </p><p> </p><p><em>Maybe she needed to give Rio more credit.</em> </p><p> </p><p>“What do you want?” Brown eyes plead with her instead.</p><p> </p><p>Because, okay, she was fucking crashing out right now. And that reality wasn’t easy to swallow. But it hung in the air like it’s own evidence of progress, because Agatha had never let herself feel like this. Had never felt safe enough to let the frustrations out into the air like this, had never been given the option.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio. Rio was safe. Rio made her feel protected in a way she couldn’t put into words, had made her feel comfortable, cared for, loved. </p><p> </p><p>The guilt was real. The truth in the way Rio’s eyes looked darker now, the blanket of positivity falling into the abyss. And Agatha hated that. Hated seeing the shift. </p><p> </p><p>She’d have to get used to the complicated reality of allowing herself to experience emotions out in the open. Settling with herself that two things could be true at once. </p><p> </p><p>“You don’t deserve this..mess,” Agatha tries again after the stunted passion passes over them, gesturing at herself, her voice cracking as it slid back into a quieter tone, the edge of it still present. </p><p> </p><p>“None of this is your fault,” Rio voices instead, the words Agatha had expected but may never believe. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>And yeah, this is fucking toxic.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Pushing Rio away, like she could breathe without her. Knowing deep in her soul that Rio would be the only person she could spill herself out in the presence of. </p><p> </p><p>“Whether I deserve it or not,” Rio starts again roughly, knowing her last words didn’t hit the way she’d hoped, giving in to respond to Agatha’s worries directly, “doesn’t change how I feel about you.”</p><p> </p><p>”Why?” Agatha hates the way her voice sounds, needy, begging, weak, “Why the fuck do you even like me?”</p><p> </p><p>”Baby,” Rio’s voice is so soft, she steps forward tentatively, not wanting to cross any boundaries Agatha was setting, not wanting to scare her, but needing Agatha to hear her. She carries the question like it offends her, like Agatha wasn’t just disrespecting herself, but questioning Rio’s discretion as well, “You are so beautiful.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em>It doesn’t feel like something to pray for, but something they already have. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You,” Rio keeps going, holding herself the few feet away like the space between them is too much, “you make me laugh,” she chuckles, “make me feel like I could do anything, your strength, your resilience, you get up everyday and still try, you try to make everyone think you’re cold and mean and calculated, because it keeps you from having to be real.” Rio gulps, “but not with me. I don’t know what I did right to be gifted with it. But when it’s just us, you’re not afraid to be you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispers like a soft warning, unsure if she can handle anymore. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re right.” Rio pushes on, setting forward, needing to, “I don’t deserve to be yelled at or pushed away,” Agatha looks down, ashamed. “But I know this is just growing pains, figuring out how to exist outside of her. I know Agatha. She’s sweet. And caring. She thinks too much, she’s observant, resourceful, smart. And she needs to give herself some grace.”</p><p> </p><p>”And what if she changes?” Agatha pushes out her final attempt at fighting this, needing to voice the insecurity, mad at herself for seeking the reassurance, “What if this version of her heals into something you don’t recognize?”</p><p> </p><p>There’s a weighted silence that follows, blue eyes locked on brown ones, the foot of space between them pulsing with heated potential, a question that holds too much uncertainty, a question Agatha shouldn’t have thought to ask, the shattering self-doubt only present from the repetition of hatred stuffed under her skin from her mother. In the end, it would always be this. Agatha afraid to lose her, scared that she didn’t deserve Rio, that she was holding her back, that it would be easier to push her away, take the control back. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>It wasn’t her fault. It wasn’t her fault.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>But it was time to end the cycle, find the paths of healing, stop subjecting herself, stop subjecting Rio to the wreckage. </p><p> </p><p>“I sit through the storm with you for the chance to see the sunlight.” Rio releases like a chant, a quiet truth. Like she’d be here to take on the rain with her, hold tight in hurricanes and earth quakes. Like they could build towards the clear skies, the single steps forward to be cherished along side the intended destination. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>For richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>The chance. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Just the possibility was worth it to Rio. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“What verse is that?” Agatha asks, a half step forward, breaking through the shield but not initiating contact first, not wanting to be swallowed in just yet. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes shift to the side, before tracing back. Contemplating. Hesitant to reveal the vulnerability. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s from the book of Rio,” She reveals, a half smirk at the way Agatha was slowly conceding, sheepish in the wake of sharing her own personal words, “A poem. Written for a girl.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew Rio wrote. A collection of poems she’d never shown her. A tiny notebook she carried in her backpack, black and leather, white lined pages that Agatha had never laid her eyes on. A section of Rio that remained secret until now. </p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t press on the new revelation, doesn’t point out the way they both could let down walls around each other, that it didn’t need to be qualified with placating observations.</p><p> </p><p>“She seems pretty lucky to have you.” Agatha tries, pressing in the truth without saying it directly, “This girl you speak of.”</p><p> </p><p>”I’m the lucky one,” Rio says and Agatha can tell she believes it, “she just doesn’t know it yet.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, thinking the day could never come when she realizes she’s out of Rio’s league. </p><p> </p><p>Rio turns to grab one of the water bottles, holds it out to Agatha like a peace offering. </p><p> </p><p>She takes it without hesitation, tired of pushing away. She sits on the bed, picking up the fallen grapes and tossing one at Rio, popping the other in her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>It hits Rio in the cheek before hitting the floor. Brown eyes blink rapidly, like she’s trying to catch up with what just happened. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha chuckles. “Not about the grape. About being a brat.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs, sits down next to her. She takes her own bottle, uncaps it, takes a sip. </p><p> </p><p>“Hmm,” Rio hums, “You’re like a rejected sour patch kid. Sour, sweet, always right next to me.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles, turning her head to look at her, Rio turning too like a magnet. </p><p> </p><p>“Can I be a green one?” </p><p> </p><p>“Why?” Rio smiles, “Cuz you think green are my favorite?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugs, smirks, smug. </p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles, pushes against Agatha’s shoulder with her own. Sighs something resigned, content in the return to their normal banter, a place far away from the worries of their lives. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Ephesians 4:26-27 -Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t remember falling asleep, just remembers Rio tucking her in. They’d shared the bowl of grapes, stopped talking about the cascading clouds of life. Rio turned on the TV, but didn’t get all the way into bed with her, sat up next to her instead, doodling in a sketchbook. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t plan on falling asleep, but the emotions brought on a new wave of exhaustion. Rio gave her a shirt to put on, the fact that she’d ripped her shirt off and spent the whole conversation in just her skirt and bra wasn’t lost on her. The fabric soft and comforting, the smell of Rio’s laundry detergent surrounding her. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe it was the quiet, the background noise of the TV along with Rio’s scribbling pencil. The steady warmth of Rio beside her, they weren’t entangled, but Rio’s knee was bent, pressing into her side, the barrier of Rio’s heavy comforter between them. The warmth, the safety, knowing they could disagree, that she could possess big emotions and Rio wasn’t kicking her out, wasn’t creating a situation they couldn’t grow from. </p><p> </p><p>When she opens her eyes, she’s not sure what time it is. Only a few hours later. Rio next to her, her posture shifted, hunched over her tiny notebook seemingly swapped out from her sketch book, her pen sliding across the page with ease. </p><p> </p><p>The TV’s playing something else now. An asmr video of someone doing a grocery haul. It’s still light outside, probably around 1 in the afternoon. </p><p> </p><p>She scans the side of Rio’s face, watching as her eyebrows scrunch in thought, her eyes tracing over the words as she writes them, her tongue poking into the inside of her cheek. She thinks about waking up next to Rio for the foreseeable future, not just for the next few months in her childhood bedroom. But for a long time, she imagined Rio older, wrinkles next to her eyes, growing fully into all her features, phases of different hairstyles. </p><p> </p><p>“Are we more Emily Dickinson or Edgar Allen Poe?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio shifts at the sound of Agatha’s voice, a little thrown by it, unaware she was awake, unaware she was being watched. Her pen comes to a stop. Brown eyes soft and steady.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t answer Agatha’s question, shifts to grab a plate from the bedside table.</p><p> </p><p>”I saved you half my grilled cheese,” Rio offers like it's effortless. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sits up, takes the plate, presses a kiss to Rio’s cheek as her thank you.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her, makes sure she’s eating, tucks back into her book, shifted just enough to hide the contents, Agatha doesn’t push, doesn’t ask to read it, knows Rio will share if she wants to. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, again.” Agatha places in the air around a mouthful of bread and cheese, coating herself in the need to say it, still feeling bad about it.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio looks up for a half a second, “I forgive you,” her foot juts out, poking Agatha’s shin with her toes. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t like making you sad.” </p><p> </p><p>“We don’t have to keep talking about it,” Rio tries, willing them to stop saying all the heavy things, so much already happening today. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha picks at the crust. </p><p> </p><p>“You just seem really sad lately.” Agatha muses, another attempt at pressing into the wound, “I don’t like being the thing making you sad.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles. A response Agatha isn’t expecting. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s funny?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s tongue swirls around her mouth, contemplating. </p><p> </p><p>“No. Sorry. I just- For a long time I thought protecting you meant shielding you from my bullshit.” Rio tries to explain. But Agatha is only more confused, unsure how that connects back. Rio seems to read the misunderstanding, she looks at Agatha waiting for the puzzle to click, but it doesn’t.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m always sort of sad,” Rio continues, shrugging like it’s simply part of her reality, something she’d gotten used to, “I guess I’ve just been hiding it from you a little less lately. You’re not the only one who built walls to protect yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice is thoughtful, certain. A resolve she’s made with herself like a sordid temptation, lowering her walls slowly, not the way Agatha’s had crashed all at once. </p><p> </p><p>“I have depression.” Rio reveals like it’s small, not noteworthy. She turns towards the nightstand again, opens the drawer, pulls out a prescribed bottle of pills, holds it up like proof, shakes the contents enough to make a noise, “Just always felt like it was small in comparison to all the stuff you have going on.”</p><p> </p><p>”Rio,” Agatha tries, looks at Rio like she wants to hold her, erase the parts that felt not extraordinary enough to voice out loud. Everything she knew about Rio was a thundering shutter, a loud laugh, a big smile, the most expressive eyes, a confidence that took up space, a spirit that demanded attention. This felt like the soft underbelly, a chance to see behind all the carefully laid scarves. She didn’t want to take it for granted.</p><p> </p><p>Underneath the guilt, the gnawing fear that her own trauma got in the way of knowing this about Rio sooner, there was a solid field of elation, knowing that Rio felt safe enough to share it now, that they weren’t perfect at this, stumbling like baby giraffes, that they were allowed to make mistakes, allowed to be human. She knew Rio’s forgiveness was not freedom to make the same mistakes over and over, but a place to be held accountable. Knowing she would be there to kiss her wounds, but also remind her that their current life is not something to get comfortable in, to keep fighting for better. </p><p> </p><p>But, Rio takes her response differently.</p><p> </p><p>”I know, I hide it well.” She sighs, “I just wanted you to know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods. Takes Rio’s empty hand, brushes over her knuckles. </p><p> </p><p>And she’s overwhelmed. Not for the first time today. But it slings her through all the intense affection she feels for the girl in front of her, a cocoon of desire that warps around them like a solid hand. It holds her up against the pulling need to crumble.</p><p> </p><p>Rio. Brave and vulnerable. Choosing to speak her truth. </p><p> </p><p>In all the attempts at throwing this away, telling herself that letting Rio in would only hurt them both. Maybe that was true. But Agatha still wanted to try, still wanted to tangle all their problems together, tie a firm knot, learn how to cope in the safety of Rio’s arms, be an anchor for all the sadness she found in brown eyes.</p><p> </p><p>She presses forward, not caring about the empty plate tilting crumbs into the sheets. She links her arms around Rio’s neck. Hugs her as tightly as she can, not knowing any words to describe it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha thinks of all the times Rio has comforted her. Thinks of the firm stroke of her thumb on her thigh, on her cheek, on her wrist, the quiet empathy in brown eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Rio taught her it wasn’t about the words. She didn’t need to find the perfect phasing or say the right thing.</p><p> </p><p>She just needed to be there. And that she could do. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>A chance. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could live with that. </p>

<p>Joshua 1:9- Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.</p><p> </p><p>It was hot outside, Spring washing softly towards Summer heat. Global warming. Agatha could remember how much snow they’d gotten in her childhood. She wasn’t really allowed outside unsupervised, she couldn’t remember a time where being a kid was about playing or creating fairytale worlds. But she remembers liking the cold, admiring snow men made by other children, watching it melt over the next few days. In the last few years, Snow days had felt less common, snow fall seldom more than a couple of inches. </p><p> </p><p>And now it seemed like Spring was a passing glance, a flash of humidity and rain before petulant sunshine kicked in. Agatha tried not to think about the cycle of change, the way time passed and even as Winter turned to Spring and Spring turned to Summer it never happened quite the same. Agatha hated sweating, a blemish on her mother’s image if her daughter had pit stains in her church clothes. She hated the sticky overwhelm, her hair clinging to her neck, nausea creeping in more easily. </p><p> </p><p>But she could take the unbearable heat if it meant seeing Rio in shorts. </p><p> </p><p>The Vidals hadn’t taken the news of suspension well, at least at first. Rio did the explaining, Agatha did the pouting and apologizing, feeling like she’d corrupted the syndicated princess, taught her how to break the rules. </p><p> </p><p>But Mrs. Vidal seemed a little less disturbed by it with the knowledge that Rio was confronting Wanda in the name of revenge. It was kind of jarring that her mother seemed less concerned when given a clear motive, like she needed a reason for it to make sense. Rio’s father was elated to learn that no punches were actually thrown, seemingly scared of the potential strength of his own daughter, as if he wasn’t built like a line backer, as if his daughter wasn’t built like a string bean.</p><p> </p><p>But being that they weren’t exactly Agatha’s legal guardians, they hadn’t forced her to go to school without Rio, had sort of assumed they’d be home together Thursday and Friday.</p><p> </p><p>So instead of some unnecessary punishment, like sending Agatha home or confiscating Rio’s phone, her parents had left her a list of chores to do while not in school, a list that seemed plausible to complete between the two of them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was focused on cutting the lawn, an electric lawn mower roaring as she clenched the handle with both hands, an AirPod in her left ear, it’s counterpart in Agatha’s right. She’s got on clear protective glasses, a shield from the dirt and grass being kicked up towards her. Agatha tries not to stare at the black tank top, the neck line that falls lower than an average T-shirt, collarbones glowing under the early afternoon sunlight. But even worse are the light pink running shorts that are loose around her hips, the tie at the front working overtime in keeping them up, short enough to expose inner thighs, an expanse of skin that rarely gets to see the sun, a lot shorter than their uniform skirts. </p><p> </p><p>The heat of her body isn’t just from the high temperatures, a dull ache she can’t push away anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallows, focusing back on the task at hand, refilling the hummingbird feeder with sugar water. She places it back on its perch, begging her hands to stay steady, letting the weight of it settle into place. Moving onto the other feeder, she fills it with bird seed from a bag in the garage. The tasks seem small, but feel significant, like she’s providing something, not repaying the Vidal’s exactly, but adding something in, doing something out of desire rather than expectation. </p><p> </p><p>She pulls her phone out of her pocket, changing the song, perhaps an attempt at getting Rio’s attention simply because she wants it, not exactly having something to say, but missing the crisp burn of brown eyes.</p><p> </p><p>SOMEBODY CALL 911 SHAWTY FIRE BURNING ON THE DANCE FLOOR</p><p> </p><p>Sean Kingston’s voice suddenly infiltrates both their ears, Rio’s head turning at break neck speed, making eye contact as she mouths the lyrics intensely, wiggling her body in a goofy collapse of limbs that still somehow makes Agatha’s heart stutter. </p><p> </p><p>This fucking dumbass.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to kiss her so fucking bad.</p><p> </p><p>She puts her phone back into her pocket, a pair of jean shorts she’d stolen from Rio’s closet, before walking towards her without hesitation, clear minded enough to stay out of the path of the mower, but wanting to be next to her, needing to see the beads of sweat on Rio’s neck up close.  </p><p> </p><p>They don’t speak, no pressure to exchange words against the surging pulse of the lawn mower. Instead Agatha’s arms snake around Rio’s stomach from behind, pull her in close enough to rest her chin on an exposed shoulder, feel the distinct warmth of sun kissed skin. Rio stops her wiggling, giving Agatha’s hold more chance to stick, finding cautious romance in the physical touch lived in the same moment of Fire Burning blaring in their ears. The hold isn’t enough to stop all of Rio’s movement, still walking forward, pushing the mower with Agatha matching the pace, clinging like a car being towed. </p><p> </p><p>Rio allows the contact, walking with more careful intention, not wanting to instigate any separation but still completing the task- at least until the song is over.</p><p> </p><p>“You alright?” Rio voices, turning slightly as she flicks off the lawn mower, suddenly more interested in Agatha than finishing their chores. </p><p> </p><p>“Mmm,” Agatha hums into her skin, pressing a few light kisses along the side of her neck, content to feel the softness against her lips for the foreseeable future, she can feel Rio buzz under the contact, “Just missed you.”</p><p> </p><p>It doesn’t make sense, missing her. They’d been together more than usual, even for just a couple of days, there wasn’t the normal time apart, like they were handcuffed together, only apart when one of them wanted to shower or had to pee. She’d like to say it was a surprise, like she thought spending every waking moment next to Rio might be a learning curve, but it felt so natural, something in her soul put at ease with the other girl close, her sleep feeling more recharging than usual with Rio’s arm wrapped around her in spite of the gnawing anxieties on the horizon. It felt simple, grounding. A new rhythm that they shifted into with ease.</p><p> </p><p>It had only been two days, but it already felt like a new habit, a fulfilling ritual, an inevitability that would be two hearts beating to the same curated playlist. </p><p> </p><p>Rio turns fully then, presses slightly out of the loose hold, just enough to see Agatha’s face, her hands still draped around her hips, now from the front, her nose skimming under Rio’s ear before coming face to face. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand comes up to brush a stray strand of hair out of her face, the pieces framing her face too short to get into the small bun, before claiming a spot against Agatha’s jaw.</p><p> </p><p>The song playing through their ears now is a chirpy pop song from the early 2000s, a name Agatha can’t place, a one-hit wonder. But the lyrics, the beat, sink to the bottom of her priorities, the playful smile on Rio’s lips taking all her attention, fighting with the need to stare endlessly into coffee brown irises, slide further into the golden glint reflected in the bright sky. Rio’s lips only look more inviting as she wets them with her own tongue, mushes them together to complete the mindless tick, the oral fixation on full display, a constant need to move. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha contemplates putting it to good use, hoping to be on the receiving end of well-intentioned bites, has yet to fully know the capability of pink lips and skillful tongue. It feels like its only getting harder by the minute, pretending she doesn’t want all of Rio, fighting the parts of her brain that protest, wicked verses that remind her of sin, premarital sex, not to mention woman laying with woman. </p><p> </p><p>It feels like background noise, idle chatter from the studio audience, an echo of disgruntled customers. Contending with her own identity had always slammed back to this. It was easier to live with the reality of being a homosexual when she wasn’t acting on it, could convince herself this wasn’t wrong if she never acted on it.</p><p> </p><p>And that had sort of sat on the back burner, something she hadn’t conflated with, convincing herself they’d never be in this position. But Agatha had kissed her, had wanted to kiss her so badly, steered by her passion in a way that didn’t leave room to question. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe it was just the insecurity talking, the desire to get this right, to please Rio in all the ways she didn’t know how. She tried to be rational, remind herself of Rio’s patience, that there would undoubtedly be a learning curve, but the inevitable stumbling already felt like a failure, a harsh place to judge herself for the slip-ups that were yet to happen. Perhaps it was easier this way, pressing it out like dough to be rolled, pushing on all the air bubbles of distinct trouble, labeling them as something else. </p><p> </p><p>A sin. </p><p> </p><p>“You okay?” Rio’s eyes scan over her face, sensing something Agatha isn’t fully presenting, but not putting in the effort to hide either. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can feel the damp exterior of Rio’s tank top, the sear of warmth floating beneath, but it doesn’t burn her, doesn’t force her to retreat. Instead it lures her in further, an idle fire that burns slow and deliberate. A safe place to bury her seeds. </p><p> </p><p>Blue eyes shine with a sign of deep satisfaction, a quaking desire to confess. She nods instead, the swirling desires to keep Rio happy brushing firmly over her chest. Words don’t come but she leans forward filling the rest of Rio’s personal space.</p><p> </p><p>Brown eyes snag on pink lips, no smirk, no quiet elation, just something disarmed, like Agatha’s proximity was starting to take hold, coax her closer to the edge. It didn’t feel like a battle anymore, a place where every kiss was a traitorous victory. It felt natural, something Agatha no longer felt guilty for wanting. And Rio wasn’t being smug about it, wasn’t teasing her, she was just falling in, basking in the sparkling progress.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kisses her, something firm and solid, out in the open on Rio’s front lawn, the hot air clinging to them, undeterred by the marks of sweat, the charged restraint in Rio’s hand staying put on Agatha’s face. </p><p> </p><p>“Baby,” Rio gasps into her mouth, like she’d suddenly remembered where they were, what they were doing, “someone might see.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hold only tightens against her hips, shuts Rio up with her own mouth, tilts her head to bring her closer. She doesn’t have to say ‘I don’t care’ for Rio to know.</p><p> </p><p>Because Rio was kissing her back, because Evanora already knew, because Rio’s parents were both at work, because no one else mattered. </p><p> </p><p>It felt like another rope being cut, like the weight of her expectations were slowly being trimmed away, weary leaves sheared off, steadily replaced by even growth. </p><p> </p><p>The moment doesn’t erase all the wicked pain, doesn’t solve the rubik's cube of self-doubt in her mind, but it heals a small tether, ties a new knot along the pathways in her brain that sew self-love, the neurons creating new patterns, making the emotions easier to find again later. Because Agatha wants to remember all of this. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Philemon 1:14- But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary. </p><p> </p><p>“We’re like…together, right?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s words slip out, calculated yet unsure, still cramped in her brain around all the uncertainty, not wanting to push, but exactly what she wants becoming clearer and clearer in her mind. </p><p> </p><p>“Still bad with words I see,” Rio smirks, a soft chuckle. It’s good to see her smile, the echo of yesterday still skirting around Agatha’s head. The more time had passed with the information fresh in her mind, it felt a lot less crushing. </p><p> </p><p>It took a few centering breaths, a reminder to herself that Rio’s mental health wasn’t exactly under her control (for better or for worse), an attempt at slashing through some of the guilt.</p><p> </p><p>But more and more, she realized Rio was still <em>Rio.</em> </p><p> </p><p>The person who made goofy comments, who sang off key to make her smile, who made weird playlists. The girl who looked at her like she was sunshine, when she’d only ever known herself to be storm clouds. A teenager, wise and naive at the same time with a protective streak that was stubborn and beautiful. An insufferable genius who filled pages with tantalizing art or stunted poetry.The person she wanted to give everything to. Some pills didn’t fucking change any of that. </p><p> </p><p>And after all the singing of insecurity, all the harsh truths sprung into the air- Agatha didn’t want either of them to question it anymore. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hair is wet, a consequence of the showers they’d taken almost immediately after coming inside. Rio’s in her parents' bathroom to give Agatha the freedom and privacy of her own. She’d had to pry Agatha’s hands off her, a sweet smile as she begged Agatha to let her finish with the lawn mower, a promise that she’d be quick. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha threw a towel over Rio’s head, scrubbed it over her hair with both hands with enough effort to force Rio to hold onto her, a small attempt at punishment for teasing her, but also still dedicated to the task at hand. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was in an oversized shirt now, basketball shorts that made Agatha’s brain short circuit a little less. The neckline wide enough to fall off one of her slim shoulders, an expanse of skin screaming out to her.</p><p> </p><p>It was starting to get annoying, how attractive she was, how hard it was getting to push down the desire. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally relents, Rio behaving herself even through the torment of Agatha’s version of a heatless drying method, pulling the towel off her head.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head once freed, shifting it back and forth quickly like a dog fresh out of a lake, droplets flinging Agatha in the face. </p><p> </p><p>“You were saying?” Rio asks, bringing back the conversation, purposely easing past the death glare sent her way. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“We’re a thing? Like a couple.” Agatha tries again, flicking the towel towards Rio like a whip.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabs onto the edge as it barely makes contact, pulls the material shifting towards herself, pulling Agatha with it until they’re only a breath apart, brown eyes satisfied as blue ones concede, falling right into her trap. </p><p> </p><p>Brown eyes flick away for a moment, a show of deep thought.</p><p> </p><p>”I mean yeah. We are two people.”</p><p> </p><p>”I’m gonna kill you,” Agatha seethes around a smile she can’t conceal, her hand coming up to Rio’s throat, letting go of the towel, letting Rio win the tug of war, but finding another way to gain the upper hand. </p><p> </p><p>“Then there would only be one person.” Rio shrugs, content to thrive as putty in Agatha’s hands, unwilling to give up, elated to find the pressure of her palm just firm enough against her vocal cords.</p><p> </p><p>One hand settles against Agatha’s wrist, keeping her hand there, the other clutching at the front bottom hem of Agatha’s shirt. Grounding, inescapable, the quiet truth that Rio doesn’t want her to stop. </p><p> </p><p>She slides into it, leaning in enough to kiss her, swallow the huff on her lips, a slow brush of lips that grows into something charged and intoxicating, Agatha opening her mouth, letting her in without so much as a protest, the pushback still present in the way they bicker, the teasing, the hesitation, but never in the charged expression found in kisses, something honest and concrete in the unarmed surrender. </p><p> </p><p>Rio groans into her mouth when she applies more pressure into her neck, her fingers flexing on instinct. It vibrates against her tongue, a swarm of bees circling in her chest, a heat that floods her cheeks, a flush of overwhelm, the whispers of an ache low in her stomach.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushes her back, removes the contact of soaring lips, a forceful push that leaves Rio reeling, her eyelids hanging a bit lower than usual, a pleasant daze at being handled so gracefully. It hits even harder knowing how physically strong Rio is, a clear awareness that Rio could easily push her away, had the ability to hold Agatha down and never let her taste a crumb of control. But she was here, moldable, willing, waiting to be taken. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s head sags forward, giving Agatha the full responsibility of holding it up. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re mine…” Blue eyes seem so sure, but the tilt of her voice leaves room for misinterpretation. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you asking? Or telling?” Rio demands clarification, still smug, as if Agatha’s hand wasn’t already claiming her, like she had any defenses left against the label they’d been fighting against for weeks.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t trying to be difficult, wasn’t trying to make the process harder for Agatha. But maybe it was a disservice in some instances to hand her everything, to make decisions for her. Rio had never been someone to take away Agatha’s agency, had never forced her into things, or stolen her choices from her grasp.</p><p> </p><p>For all the times Rio tried to convince Agatha to tell someone about Evanora, for all the new revelations, Rio had always allowed Agatha the chance to make her own decisions. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe it was an effort to ease into it. A way to teach her how to find a path without real world consequences, a place where Rio was safe, where Agatha could make mistakes and not be eternally stricken for it. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora had never given her the chance to fuck up. And now every small hiccup felt like a failure, any slip up feeling insurmountable, a point of evidence held up in the mirror, a reminder that her mother painted her as worthless and incompetent.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was helping her rewrite that, another neural pathway, a tentative line of pencil now permanent in sharpie. A reason to keep trying in spite of the fear. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you want to be my girlfriend?” Agatha finally relents, her hand losing all its force, sliding slightly to curl over Rio’s shoulder, smooth over her collar, left with something soft and sturdy.</p><p> </p><p>It’s an even question, a tilt of her head like she is open and patient, searching Rio’s eyes for a true ounce of hesitation, confirming that the teasing is for show, no actual push back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had given her the steering wheel a long time ago, but she was still learning how to drive, how to hit the pedals with the right amount of pressure. It wasn’t ever easy, letting Rio guide from the passenger seat, but still having to rely on her own movements. But now Agatha needed to make this a two person job. The car metaphor wasn’t sticking anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Because this was a relationship now, a semblance of actions that deeply affected them both. Agatha wanted this, a line of certainty between them where kissing and cuddling and letting go of their armor wasn’t a phase, wasn’t something they could push away or write off as a moment of unbalanced teenage vulnerability.</p><p> </p><p>This was real to her. And she wanted to respect it. Give it a name. Face it in the wake of her fear. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods softly, a hopeful resolve settling over her features, a comforting smile, wistful and certain, like she’d been waiting for an eternity for this moment, something solid, a wish granted out loud, “Yeah. I do.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha surges forward to kiss her again, clamped over the satisfied chuckle that leaves Rio’s lips, a smattering of follow through that shuts her up.</p><p> </p><p>”What?” Agatha breathes into her mouth, amused by Rio’s laugh, wondering what she was thinking about.</p><p> </p><p>”Kinda thought you’d drag that out a little more. Wasn’t done teasing you.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand slides over the side of Agatha’s rib cage, a reminder that she isn’t wearing a bra, the truth of it seems to flash in brown eyes too as her fingers skate just under her armpit, where she knows Agatha is ticklish.</p><p> </p><p>It’s not a full attempt, just a graze, just enough to make Agatha squirm, a warning. It sings in all the recent changes, the way Rio was acting without hesitation, reaching for her own desires, unafraid to tickle her, smug that Agatha would forgive her regardless. That she was still inexplicably Rio, chaotic, and matching Agatha’s banter without so much as a flicker of backing down, solid, giving Agatha the reins, but also keeping her own desires on the scale.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe not a car. Maybe a tandem bicycle. Or a plane, co-pilots. </p><p> </p><p>She tries to quiet the hitch in her breath, the way her body slightly recoils from the way her skin prickles under Rio’s fingertips, how the other part of her brain keeps her close, reminds her she’s safe.</p><p> </p><p>Rio discovered she was ticklish years ago, Agatha watching Rio shoot a basketball into the hoop in her driveway, a faded backboard, the strings gray and frayed. Watching had turned into Rio teaching her how to shoot, adjusting her form, pulling at her fingers until they held the ball correctly. Which turned into 1-on-1, Agatha trying anything to get Rio to miss, playing dirty, slamming into her hip, grabbing her wrists, fouling her repeatedly. After the 5th time Agatha had traveled, colliding into Rio’s chest like she had free reign to topple her, the game of frustration mounted enough to try her own tactics, meet Agatha’s cheating defense with her own criminal strategy.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t something Agatha told her, just a guess. A flick of her fingers against Agatha’s ribs that she hoped would bare a specific reaction.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha yelped at the movement, losing focus as she lost control of her dribble, squirming away from the contact as Rio easily stole the ball, bounded the short distance to the hoop for a lay-up. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s cheating.” Agatha said. An adorable pout on her lips, her hands sat defensively on her hips, her breathing stirred up past normal.</p><p> </p><p>Rio remembers feeling elated back then, not only that her plan worked, but it was also another frame of Agatha’s comfort around her. The girl who followed rules, the perfect Catholic daughter, who felt safe enough with Rio to cheat her way through an entire game of pickup, and then seamlessly accuse Rio of all the wrong doing. </p><p> </p><p>And Rio hadn’t really used it as a weapon, instead filing away the information like a piece of blackmail, something she’d threaten Agatha with, but never really act on in harsh tangible waves. I poke to the ribs the night they’d kissed for the first time, a flash of a threat when Agatha said something self-deprecating or pushed too far. </p><p> </p><p>Even now it felt like a means of pushing them forward more than an attempt at harm.</p><p> </p><p>”How romantic.” Agatha deadpans in the present, her breath still partially caught, trying to push away the surge of desire from the simple touch.</p><p> </p><p>She can feel her breaths growing deeper, her chest rising more soundly, breathing Rio in, the smile claiming her whole, her nose brushing Rio’s cheek, searching, waiting for Rio to take her turn at the wheel. </p><p> </p><p>Both of Rio’s hands stake claim on her, reading something in Agatha’s eyes, or simply pressing in without hesitation, she isn’t sure. But she’s too caught in the way Rio’s fingers settle against her ribs to question it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha isn’t laughing, isn’t pulling away. It doesn’t feel like a tickle anymore. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s fingers skim solidly now, an exploration that stirs just below her breasts, a hair away from finding the weight of her chest. Agatha can feel the skin there wake up, like a newly discovered echo of pleasure, Rio not even touching somewhere sensitive, but the implication setting her on fire. </p><p> </p><p>It feels a lot like panicking, a coil in her stomach that rivals the throws of anxiety. </p><p> </p><p>Excitement. A difference in the way she doesn’t want it to stop, wants the flame to reach its peak. </p><p> </p><p>“What do you want for lunch?” Rio voices, grumbled softly between them, it marks a new path of quitting while they’re ahead, the same crash of a yield sign that Rio had always put in place, a means of giving them an easy escape, but she doesn’t pull away just yet, pressing into the bones of her torso, feeling the chorus of each pulsing breath, it stings the tips of Agatha’s ears.</p><p> </p><p>She isn’t bold enough to answer the way she wants to.</p><p> </p><p><em>You</em>. </p><p> </p><p>But she knows they have a list of chores to finish, a range of emotions to catalog before clothes come off. </p><p> </p><p>She captures Rio’s lips once more, a hunger in the push of it, her fingers gliding against Rio’s jaw as her hands press firmly into her, palms dragging over her but never fully making contact with where she wants. </p><p> </p><p>The curl of a whine escapes from Rio’s mouth as Agatha bites down on her bottom lip, something singing inside her at the noise, the swell of power rising in her gut. She can’t stop it, the buzzing need to be closer, to open Rio up and burrow inside the warmth. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha isn’t sure what comes over her, but her nipples harden without direct attention, begging in a way Rio can’t see. She takes matters into her own hands, grabbing onto one of Rio’s wrists, halting the pointed exploration of her sides and ribs, gripping onto her hand and redirecting it, pressing the palm directly over her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio whines again at the new sensation, being guided without hesitation, her hand finding it’s new home as she squeezes lightly at first, trying to decipher the exact effects of each movement. She squeezes again, a bit less delicate, swallows the waves of Agatha’s breathing.</p><p> </p><p>She tries not to get lost in the sensation, the sensitivity a surprise to herself, not something she’s given herself the freedom to figure out on her own. She can feel the firm bud pressing into Rio’s palm, the pleasant pain as Rio’s hand mushes over the full weight of it, cupping and squeezing. </p><p> </p><p>In all the newness, it is unbearably not enough, kissing into Rio’s mouth like she’s begging for more, trying her best not to collapse, anchoring her arms over Rio’s shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio seems to get the message, easing the kiss in just the right moment, sinking slightly back to change the angle of her hand, rubs more firmly at her nipple with her thumb before pulling it between her fingers.</p><p> </p><p>For a brief moment, Agatha wonders if Rio’s ever done this before, touched another girl like this, if she was running on the instinct of want or practiced experience. Traitoriously, Ralph pops into her head for a fleeting second, how she’s granted him access to her boobs (over the bra, she’s not classless) and how it had felt nothing close to this. How giving Ralph permission hadn’t felt like an opulent sin. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe that was the difference. Ralph felt like a transaction. A means of getting her first kiss over with. But Rio tied her stomach in knots, a field of unchecked feelings that she couldn’t pass off as anything other than heated want. This felt wrong because she couldn’t write it off as something else, couldn’t explain it away. Something tangible in the way that it felt so right. A confession she couldn’t hide from God. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>And lead us not into temptation.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s other hand finds purchase in the same vein, like she’d suddenly remembered there were two options to pay attention to, to please into hardened points. A steady course of earning small sounds from Agatha’s mouth, a freedom in the way she had yet to be silenced, no need to hide the way the action had taken her breath, made her grip onto Rio tighter. </p><p> </p><p>She can feel the pulse in her underwear like a warning, her body screaming at her to cave in, to find release.</p><p> </p><p>It’s a startling push, a new sense of desire she can’t fully process. It’s not a yield sign. It’s a stop. A forced U-turn. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha falls out of the kiss, pressing her hands into the backs of Rio’s, a firm hold, just enough to stop any movement.</p><p> </p><p>She tilts her head up into Rio’s face, trying to find her breath, doing her best to speak without words.</p><p> </p><p>Rio almost looks tired, lulled into a sense of comfort, heavy-lidded eyes, almost black, a small duck of her head inwards searching for another kiss. Agatha meets it halfway, letting the peck find a home for a second, the contrast sudden against the way their lips cling differently than before. She seems to understand the lull, the pushback as a means of interference, slowing them down for now. She rests their foreheads together, lets Agatha ground herself. </p><p> </p><p>“You um- yeah.” Rio tries for words, incoherent messages, a crackle in her voice that leaves her clearing her throat, an unintended reassurance in the way it affected her just as intensely. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha nods into her, smug on her own for once, amused by Rio’s internal collapse, like she’d died for a moment and gone to heaven, back now, still speechless, “I know.”</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Malachi 3:10- Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,” says the Lord Almighty. “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it.</p><p> </p><p>Going back home- Evanora’s house isn’t exactly her first choice. </p><p> </p><p>But day 2 of her excursion and it was already becoming clear that they hadn’t packed for more than a couple of days. And as much as she loved stealing Rio’s clothes, there was still a piece of her soul that ached for some things to stay the same. </p><p> </p><p>She wanted her worn in brown sweater that was losing threads at the elbow, she wanted the scratchy blanket she slept with each night, the bright green socks Evanora got from goodwill, the plain church appropriate shirts that covered her shoulders and chest. It felt like something easy to hold onto, a little harder to go back and retrieve. She’d find the freedom of figuring out her own style at a later date, because right now this felt like the only safe bet at normalcy.</p><p> </p><p>For all the glorious ways things had shifted with Rio, it was still change, a shock wave that had her clinging for balance. Of course only an added layer to everything else going on. </p><p> </p><p>Rio drives her there with little protest, maybe officially under Agatha’s spell now, slipping back into the teasing banter after a blueberry pop tart and a glass of water, but existing a little closer, tabbing herself out of the margins and taking up the whole page. </p><p> </p><p>They’d taken three large suitcases from Rio’s attic with them. A silent act from Rio that wasn’t going unappreciated, a chance to truly take anything she’d ever want, close a chapter without fear that her mother would swallow away her worldly possessions. She throws all her clothes in without sifting through them, Rio tossing in anything she can find, the extra floss in the cabinet over the sink, the folders in the closet filled with every test she’d even gotten 100 on- thicker than Rio expects. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha makes sure to fish out the deck of tarot cards Lilia had given her all those years ago, purposely hidden in a shoe box. Rio climbs over the bed, suddenly remembering where Agatha tucked her old journal the last time they were here. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you want the cross?” Rio points to the only decoration on her walls, something akin to taking it just for the sake of it, leaving no trace, Agatha wonders if Rio’s contemplating taking the bed too. </p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha rolls her eyes, rummaging through a ziplock filled with prayer cards, wondering if there’s anyone worth keeping. It’s stored in a box of special edition bibles and Catholic workbooks for kids. </p><p> </p><p>Cycling through the cards, Agatha guesses this is what it’s like to swipe on a dating app, swiping left on her 10th white man, the only difference being half of them died of heart disease. She honestly doesn’t know why she kept most of these, maybe quelled by the fear of death, the respect of God's strength, honoring His creation through honoring the dead. Something taught to her younger than necessary, the burden of reality thrust on her earlier than most children. She vaguely wonders when she stopped thinking like that, when it had morphed into fears of her own death, where funerals blurred together under the constant of her own injuries.</p><p> </p><p>She stops on one card in particular, Santiago Vidal, named after Saint James the apostle, one of the first to join Jesus, Rio’s grandfather. Maybe the one she was subconsciously looking for, she presses the rest of the stack back in the bag, shoves the box back into the closet, doesn’t look for her own uncle or Evanora’s mother.</p><p> </p><p>”Who’d you take?” Rio asks suddenly, noticing the movement from the other side of the room.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gets up, meets her halfway, slides the card into Rio’s hands.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know him that well before he passed, met him a handful of times, but he seemed like a jovial old man, Rio’s mother’s father, a man with 4 daughters who never wished for sons. </p><p> </p><p>Rio would tell her stories about him sometimes, how he took care of her a lot as a baby, his wife, Rio’s grandmother had died before she was born, and he stepped in so Rio’s parents didn’t have to pay for childcare. Rio’s mother said she gave him purpose again, that taking care of baby Rio kept him going after the loss of his wife.</p><p> </p><p>He was the first one to call Rio ‘chispita’ the nickname she loved so much she didn’t understand that it wasn’t her actual name. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes land on the card for half a second before recognition floods her features, a warm smile as she traces the edges of the plastic, a small picture of him on one side, a bright smile on his face.</p><p> </p><p>She tugs at Agatha’s hand, presses a soft kiss into her hairline, unable to speak the emotions, but needing to express it somehow. </p><p> </p><p>“You think he’d be cool with all this?” Agatha chuckles, taking in the explosion of items on her floor, a nervous edge knowing from stories that Santiago was fun and lively, but was still a man of God, valued order, instilled in Rio the parts that held close to following in that path. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s watery smile slammed into her like she’d pushed farther than intended.</p><p> </p><p>”I don’t know,” Rio shrugs, “Just know he loved me.”</p><p> </p><p>A warmth, a certainty, a love that coated Rio long before she knew what death was, the things that God could take away in the same way He’d gifted them. A certainty that Agatha only got in fleeting moments from Lilia, from God and then no one until Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s like the first thing I thought of when I realized I was queer,” she continues after a beat, brown eyes straying towards Agatha’s window, a clouded pressure, “That even when we didn’t agree, or I spent the whole day being a brat, he still tucked me in,” she turns to Agatha again, wrapping her in a loose embrace, seeking out the contact without thought, “kissed me on the forehead, and told me that he loved me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha settles in the warmth, doesn’t fight the way Rio’s delicate presence kicks up her heartbeat for the 100th time today. It soothes open the scars like proof that unconditional love existed, so much so that Rio still felt it after death. </p><p> </p><p>It reminds her that Rio had been taken care of as a child, a blessing. The jealously never finds her face, instead the blessing leaks onto her too, knowing that without it, Rio would not be herself, wouldn’t extend that unconditional love to Agatha as well.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha stops asking ‘why?’, stops wondering why she’d been given such a shitty hand of cards, stops begging to know where it all was, why she had to wait so long for it. </p><p> </p><p>Instead, she thanks God that Rio never had to question her parents’ love for her. She finds gratitude in the way she wasn’t the bystander, the one forced to watch. She thanks the universe that she has Rio now, a perfect amount of space in three suitcases to pack up everything she’s ever known, the perfect fit in Rio’s arms. </p><p> </p>

<p>Philippians 3:13- Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead.</p><p> </p><p>The daze of morning light shuffling through Rio’s window isn’t as cutting as she’s used to. Maybe it's the warm toned gray of the curtains, a color that clashes with the cool blues and greens that fill most of the space. Maybe it’s the warmth of a bedroom covered in things that undoubtably belong to Rio, a person with the freedom to decorate the walls with silly doodles, fuck up the paint with duct tape and band stickers, make a mess of clothes and used cups. Maybe it’s the fact that all her things are here now, half spilled out of suitcases, a half-hearted attempt at organizing Rio’s closet, sharing some hangers. Maybe it’s Rio, still tucked snuggly beside her, the obscene heat, pressing moisture between them, where bare thighs meet and sweat accumulates.</p><p> </p><p>Saturday comes with the blessing of sleeping in, a list of chores complete, Mr. Vidal not at Rio’s bedroom door at 7 am, like the past two days, to tell them he was leaving for work (telling them without explicitly voicing it: they’d be alone, to stay on task, to behave).</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s parents still weren’t made aware of the new developments in their relationship, a topic that Rio decided could be pushed off for now, especially considering they were both relying on them for everything now. It dawns on Agatha that it might be time to start applying to jobs, something part-time at least for the summer, if not to give herself a cushion, then to offer support to the household, taking on another person using electricity and water, another mouth to feed. </p><p> </p><p>But right now, she can’t be bothered by the harsh press of sunlight or the impending change still to come or the inevitable crash of her mother in their lives. Right now, there’s just Rio, almost completely under the blanket, the mess of her hair poking out from the lump of warmth, her chin tucked into Agatha’s collar bone, almost completely laid on her stomach, her arm lazily draped over her waist. Agatha can feel Rio’s arm shift with each solid breath, the way it doesn’t falter in the wake of the movement. </p><p> </p><p>She can’t help herself, tilting her head forward to press a kiss into her head, undeterred by the mess of dark strands. When she gains consciousness of her own arm again, she finds it on Rio’s back, sliding into the ease of stroking against her spine. Finally accounting for her legs, it’s hard to tell where Rio ends and she begins. </p><p> </p><p>For once, the soaring of her heart isn’t overwhelming, because this is so easy, fitting together and not questioning it, sinking into the safety, knowing with extreme certainty this will not be the last time she gets to hold Rio like this. </p><p> </p><p>Rio stirs slightly, a shiver in her back that Agatha feels against her hand, she uses the other to brush dark hair away, try to find Rio’s sleepy face. </p><p> </p><p>But the other girl only presses in further, a sharp groan pressed against Agatha’s shoulder, a startling sigh. Rio stretches her arms and legs but it brings them even closer, the tense pull of her limbs snaking further around her, before releasing, content to rub her face against Agatha’s chest, settle again in the new position, Rio almost fully on top of her. </p><p> </p><p>A moment passes, Rio slack and stationary, Agatha’s hand continuing the pattern on her spine, convinced that Rio has fallen back asleep, not disturbed by the proximity or Agatha’s slow ministrations. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs something heavy, a centering breath that shifts them a bit, a blissful pattern of content as her eyes fall closed again, ready to sink back into sleep, more than okay with wasting the day away in Rio’s bed.</p><p> </p><p>But the body on top of her shifts again, her face angling to the side, her nose bumping over Agatha’s jawline, her head tilting back giving permission before the ask has even fully processed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swears Rio’s mouth feels warmer than usual, perhaps a consequence of waking up less than 5 minutes ago, but it makes her breath shudder all the same. She can feel Rio pushing in closer with each stunted exhale, like a cadence of back and forth as she kisses along her neck.</p><p> </p><p>The delicate press of lips transforms after a moment, Rio’s tongue making solid appearances in each new kiss before staking claim on a specific spot, not particularly anywhere special, as if to paste glitter over all the unremarkable parts of her, as if to declare the importance of a random square inch of the side of her neck. </p><p> </p><p>She gasps at the feel of teeth, the release of air that has her grasping at the back of Rio’s shirt, her other hand threading through her hair.</p><p> </p><p>It feels like a pleasant suffocation, a tilted reality where Rio’s body morphs into her own, her arms bracket around Agatha’s torso, nowhere else to go. Their legs morph too, both of Agatha’s legs wrapped around Rio’s hips, keeping her there, not allowing escape. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s teeth scrape against her as she sucks, a chorus of soft moans and stilted sighs cresting the air as Agatha forgets to hold back, too pliable and unmasked this early in the morning. </p><p> </p><p>She becomes increasingly aware of the sweat between them, the cold flush building under the blankets, the way it seems to only spur Rio on, as her hand presses over Agatha’s stomach, slides over her abs like the slick skin is a slip-n-slide. </p><p> </p><p>Her fingers glide forward under Agatha’s already bunched up T-shirt eased by the wetness, finding a home between her boobs, scratching at her sternum, a delicate test, a tease and a chance to push her away in one. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s knees bend slightly, edging Agatha’s legs further apart, settling her weight against her core. It’s intoxicating, a fever dream, a practice in patience, the way Agatha aches to keep going, already feeling like this would be enough, not able to imagine what more would feel like, connecting with Rio that way, when half-grinding on each other was already driving her crazy.</p><p> </p><p>It was a rush, a crowded train of thoughts that shot her open, left no room in her brain to overthink it. Rio was clouding everything, she couldn’t bring herself to pretend like it wasn’t everything she’d ever wanted.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wanting her this way, it sang in her brain like an unbroken promise, something primal and pure, like Rio was running on instinct, pressed tightly against her without fear that Agatha didn’t want it, confident in the fact that Agatha would push her away if that’s what she wanted. </p><p> </p><p>Right now, she wanted Rio to keep biting her neck, to move her hand just enough to the right to take her nipple between her fingers, to continue the streak of pain from her neck onto her chest.  </p><p> </p><p>She seems to read Agatha’s mind, pressing up on her elbows, swapping sides to the other half of Agatha’s neck, nipping at her skin as she rolls Agatha’s shirt up over her chest, revealing two hardened nipples and the scratch mark she’d just created between them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes initiative in flipping the covers back, uncovering their upper bodies, perhaps to allow some of the cold in, or give Rio a better look.</p><p> </p><p>The fan blows cool air onto their warm skin, she tries not to shiver as Rio’s hands suddenly cover her chest, a clench in her gut as fingers pull expertly, a dizzying balance of gentle that concedes into firm pulls and harsh squeezes.</p><p> </p><p>The moans from her mouth come back, revisiting a little more solidly as Rio’s hands scratch over chest, her lips kissing over her throat. They quake out of her chest a little louder, noises she didn’t know she could make, a groan that she thought belonged to Rio at first. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s head ducks in a flash, her warm tongue skating over the mound of flesh like it had no specific destination, until shifting forward, taking a nipple into her mouth, soft suction at first, a crying plea that breaks from Agatha’s lips in response.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand grabs at the back of Rio’s neck, a dangerous leash, an echo of ownership at the way Rio steers them here and Agatha makes sure it continues. She’s too content and stirred to think, consumed by the flurry in her stomach, the clenching in her core, a wetness in her underwear that feels foreign but sacred. Her hand simply grabs at her nape, unable to think to pull at Rio’s hair or return the crazed pleasure in any meaningful way.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she lets Rio’s mouth claim her, the softness coaxed over into something more hurried, biting and striking curls of tongue, taking turns flicking over each nipple like Rio would simply never be satiated.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s thigh flexes forward with the arc of a particularly well placed lick, a choked sob careening into the air, a sobering sound that Rio’s fan isn’t loud enough to drown out. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispers breathlessly, suddenly embarrassed at how affected she’d been by this, feeling a hair away from wrecked with her underwear still in place. </p><p> </p><p>Finally, gaining some brain power, she pulls at Rio’s hair, tugging just enough for the flesh to pop out of her mouth, tilts her head up with her other hand to find the darkened eyes, the swollen lips, the concerned look. </p><p> </p><p>“Your parents are home,” Agatha reminds them both, a shuddering breath, an attempt at keeping it together.</p><p> </p><p>As much as she wanted to keep going, to bare her body and her soul (a new realization that doesn’t feel as startling as she thought it would), Agatha knows she won’t be able to fully relax with the knowledge that one or both of Rio’s parents could hear them or walk in on them. </p><p> </p><p>She can feel the blush on her own face, only made worse by the way Rio’s eyes seem to trace over her features. </p><p> </p><p>Rio surges forward enough to connect their lips for the first time today, a firm press that makes Rio’s covered chest collide with Agatha’s bare one. A test of wills at the whimper that spills out.</p><p> </p><p>”You’re gonna have to learn how to be quiet.” Rio sort of chuckles, something between smug and disarming, the realization that Rio’s eyes were just as glazed over, that making Agatha feel good made Rio shudder too, just as happy to be the one giving, thrown off balance by the sequence of tilted moans and gasping breaths. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s thumbs suddenly appear, stroking over her chest softly, a pleasant surprise that makes Agatha yelp, her hands grabbing onto Rio’s wrists, an effort to keep the touch light but not put a stop to it completely.</p><p> </p><p>”I don’t think I can be quiet,” Agatha confesses under her breath, a small shake of her head, feeling powerful in the vulnerability, needing to watch Rio’s eyes glow at the truth of it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio kisses her again, soft but open, a confession in its own right, it makes Agatha’s nose scrunch, the gentle movement of her mouth, unrelenting and certain. </p><p> </p><p>“I think I’m obsessed with your boobs,” Rio says too seriously, her head sliding forward to lick at them again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha half winces, trying to hold in the sounds her chest aches to let loose.</p><p> </p><p>”You haven’t known them long enough to be obsessed.” Agatha uses both hands to tilt Rio’s head back up, meet her eyes, and allows her fingers to continue grazing over her chest, Rio’s mouth is too much. </p><p> </p><p>Rio pouts, her lips fully jutting out. Agatha kisses her nose, a solid smile at Rio’s attempt to get what she wants.</p><p> </p><p>”Stop making that face.”</p><p> </p><p>A small huff leaves Rio’s mouth, turning her head back down, she doesn’t swipe her tongue over recovering nipples, or bare her teeth. </p><p> </p><p>Instead she plants small kisses along the top of her chest, down over her sternum, her thumbs still working. Her nose bumps over one side before taking a nipple into her mouth again, soft, slow. Her tongue swirls, a severed gasp, a charged plea, broken and begging, a pained flex of unbridled desire. </p><p> </p><p>She unlatches a moment later, kissing over the shadow of her own mouth, seemingly content for the time being, seeing Agatha’s reasoning in putting this on hold. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wants to look at her, drown in brown irises, savor the quiet. She scratches at her scalp, coaxes Rio back into a cuddled position, finds solace in the way Rio curls into her, rests her head in the crook of her neck. </p><p> </p><p>Rio kisses the underside of her jaw, it doesn’t feel like the end, no closing books or wicked cliff hangers. It feels like a bookmark, a placeholder to come back to.</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>The animal shelter is a good reprieve from the dense intimacy of Rio’s room. A reminder that if given the chance she’d lock herself and Rio in a basement, never return to civilization. They’d die from starvation or lack of vitamin D. </p><p> </p><p>Still, the icy exterior, the harsh walls always came down for animals, the purest of God’s inventions, seeking care, seeking shelter.</p><p> </p><p>Billy had insisted on giving Agatha a full tour, but Rio waved him off, already sensing the crippling enthusiasm, the eager excitement in his eyes that she knew would overwhelm Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>Instead, she thrusts the spray bottle and paper towels into his hands, puts him on crate cleaning duty. He doesn’t protest, closing his mouth like Rio had cast a silencing spell, a raise of his eyebrows as he shuts down his own ramblings for the moment and gets to work.</p><p> </p><p>”Are you his boss?” Agatha scrunches her nose, unsure but amused at the way he gave up so easily. </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, playfully rolling her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“Just a volunteer,” she winks, gesturing to the lanyard around her neck, the identification card reading ‘volunteer’.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches forward to wrap her own hand around it, tugging Rio slightly toward her, inspecting the laminated card.</p><p> </p><p>”Bummer,” Agatha chimes, traces over the letters as she gazes up at Rio through her eyelashes, “Kind of wanted you to boss me around.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes bulge for a moment, her tongue swiping through her mouth without thought, a nervous tick Agatha had long been trying to coax out.</p><p> </p><p>”When did you turn into an evil seductress?” Rio scoffs, pulling the lanyard out of Agatha’s grasp, stepping back. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you gonna tell me what to do or not?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“Grab a couple of leashes off the wall. We’re gonna take a few of the smaller dogs out first.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles sweetly, happy to get her way, even if Rio is pretending to be reluctant about it. </p><p> </p><p>The day moves easily, listening intently to Rio’s instructions, spending time playing with the animals, giving each of them outside time, playing with toys and scratching behind their ears.</p><p> </p><p>It feels like a safe place to exist outside of willful expectations, where Rio can watch her from across the room without feeling like the gaze is overwhelming. She isn’t afraid of anyone seeing this, no longer ashamed of the truth of it, willing to have it out in the open, even if its just people in and out trying to adopt a pet, Billy roaming from each enclosure with his paper towels and treats, and any other volunteers. </p><p> </p><p>It’s nice. Seeing Rio be so gentle with them, speaking in a high pitched voice and giving Agatha a rundown on the specific personality of each animal.</p><p> </p><p>”This is Gus,” Rio gestures toward the bulldog as she lets him free, he immediately jumps up to settle his paws against her thighs, sniffing at her hands eagerly, “He loves a good nap.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha let’s Gus smell her feet first, following the way Rio had explained to approach each new animal, cautious, allowing them to lead the interaction. He circles her, sniffing obsessively, before Rio lifts him up, still pretty small. Agatha scratches at the side of his neck, before he turns his head, licking her hand. </p><p> </p><p>“He’s looking for snacks,” Rio laughs.</p><p> </p><p>”Maybe he just likes me.”</p><p> </p><p>”They all like you.” Rio counters, “But Gus here is mostly motivated by food.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches into Rio’s pocket, knowing where the treats are by now.</p><p> </p><p>”Someone’s handsy”</p><p> </p><p>”Just making sure Gus doesn’t starve.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, but smiles. </p><p> </p><p>Gus takes the treat from Agatha’s hand without hesitation, barely chewing it before swallowing.</p><p> </p><p>”Told you.”</p><p> </p><p>It feels like a quiet reprieve, somewhere safe from the heaviness of change. A chapter of quiet before the chaos. A moment to breathe. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows she has to live for these pockets of joy, push through the ugliness of growth and fight for the shreds of light, look for the acorns amongst the dirt, gather them up and hold them close, remind herself that in all the pain there is still a pretty girl who is standing next to her in the rain, still Rio, solid and undeterred. </p><p> </p><p>She watches the way Rio seems so carefree here, sure of herself in a setting Agatha had yet to witness until now, it feels grounding and severely adult, a taste of the next chapter, what jobs and responsibilities will look like. She tries not to dream too big, like a beautiful home with a white picket fence, a reality check in reevaluating what she wants, allowing herself to envision it, but still afraid to give it space, afraid it might be taken away.</p><p> </p><p>She tries to imagine it. Rio building a garden in the back, watching in a lawn chair, feeding her balls of watermelon so she doesn’t have to take off her gloves, a few dogs running around, another thing Agatha has never experienced, a responsibility she actually wants, taking care of something not as some formal exchange, no transaction, just love and loyalty. </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps motivated by the way Rio already cares so much about animals, making her happy can be part of the reason too. </p><p> </p><p>It’s not a concrete plan, just cautious musings, enough to draw the imagination back, set a course where dreaming is not a crime. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Proverbs 30:5-6 - Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar. </p><p> </p><p>Church was an inevitability. </p><p> </p><p>Every Sunday for as long as she could remember. Sunday mornings were a dedicated tradition, a road she had no opportunity to turn away from. </p><p> </p><p>As a child, it felt like connection, protection. A place where she was safe from her mother’s cold words and unrelenting hands. A time where prayer still felt like a means for better.</p><p> </p><p>For all Hail Mary’s, for all the Our Father’s, Agatha’s mother still hit her with shoes, still pushed her, still wound callous insults around her soul, still withheld basic necessities. </p><p> </p><p>Somewhere along the way it shifted, prayer made her feel powerless, like a slave to an unresolved story, a ritual she still completed for the sake of falling in line, another expectation she could not divert from if it meant securing her own safety.</p><p> </p><p>For the Vidal’s it had always been about honoring the people that came before them, following in the beliefs of their parents and their grandparents. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s parents were believers, had felt the protection of community, saw the ideals as guidelines to be moral people, didn’t use the gospel to cast judgement.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha was sort of envious of that perception, wished she’d been given the freedom to find personal value in Christianity. But Evanora hadn’t treated it like a choice, the only option was to live by His teachings, particularly the ones she’d held most significant. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s father had given her an option at the front door.</p><p> </p><p>They were already dressed. On the verge of leaving.</p><p> </p><p>Rio and her mother were already outside, heading for the car.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t mean to hesitate, didn’t mean for anyone to witness it.</p><p> </p><p>But he read it in the way she slipped on her shoes by the door, something barely there.</p><p> </p><p>”You can stay home” Rio’s father breathes, soft and warm, Agatha tries to hide the way her own breath changes at the way he extends the word ‘home’ over her as well, something like belonging, “it’s up to you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t know how to hold the choice without feeling weighed down, unsure how to move under her own desires. It opens like a blister, a new chance for regret, a consequence she’ll have to tangle around her own guilt. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m coming.” She confirms, needing to fill the silence, but also knowing sitting here alone wouldn’t help the gnawing anxiety either, finding comfort in the way church was expected, something her body was used to. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, hermosa.” He answers, no discouraging grumbles, no woeful praise, just the certainty that Agatha could make a decision for herself, that she truly had the right to decide and his opinion didn’t matter.</p><p> </p><p>He waits another moment for Agatha to step outside, locks the door behind them. The opportunity closed to turn back. </p><p> </p><p>The static contemplation of her decision settles as she sits next to Rio in the back seat of their Honda Pilot. She smooths out the wrinkles in her flowy skirt, pretends she can’t feel the way Rio is watching her.</p><p> </p><p>It coats her like a security blanket, another set of eyes watching out for her. Rio doesn’t grab her hand, but she traces over her knuckles with her fingertips, a soft grounding sensation, enough to make her shiver.</p><p> </p><p>It holds all the words they can’t exchange in earshot of Rio’s parents. </p><p> </p><p>A reminder that there’s still a reason to hide. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries to remind herself that the veil is temporary, that the Vidal’s are not evil, they do not wield the same condemnation as her mother, of the world that has made her bite away all the parts of herself that don’t fit the mold of her divine communion. </p><p> </p><p>She finds herself wanting to apologize, for the fear that eats away at her insides, for believing that they could hate her even for a second. Agatha is unsure why Rio is still waiting, wondering where the fear in brown eyes takes claim, perhaps not wanting reality to shift, for her parents to perceive her differently.</p><p> </p><p>But, she can’t help but reckon with the glaring contrast, Evanora’s declaration of hatred, posed next to the way Rio’s mother and father had extended their home, their resources, their love, asking for nothing in return. </p><p> </p><p>Walking through the main doors of the church doesn’t open her wounds the way she thought it might. Rio is still close, but no longer touching her, the way presence doesn’t have to contain anything tactile, the easy flow of people, the soft reassurance of everything always in the same place, it settles something in her. </p><p> </p><p>The panic attack she’d been choking down eases out in a breath, idle chatter, the harsh wood on the pew under her thighs. The stained glass seems brighter than usual, the lilac shards cresting over sunlight. It feels like visiting an old friend, grazing callous hands over the places she still wants to reach, find comfort in the routine. </p><p> </p><p>God. She still has to reckon with the parts of Him she wants to hold onto, find the even ground where she isn’t tripping over her own feet, deciding if this is more than just familiar, if she can untangle the damnation and the judgement from the goodness she’s held onto for as long as she can remember.</p><p> </p><p>The one thing that isn’t familiar is a particular absence. Something missing. Not the prayer candles, or the yellowing carpet, or the creaky floors.</p><p> </p><p>Evanora. A fixture in the church as necessary as the altar. An echo of her prideful reputation, Sunday mass never missed.</p><p> </p><p>For a second, the wave of sorrow sinks forward, Agatha’s mind assuming her mother would pass away before missing Church. A trip her brain makes without her consent, trained year after year to conflate her own emotions to make room for the ever-growing attention Evanora required. </p><p> </p><p>She pushes down the irrational worry, convinces herself to focus on Rio, a running mantra of her voice, ‘it’s okay, you’re okay’. She sighs, Rio’s hand brushing over her knee to stop the nervous shaking, ground her back into the present. It feels just as jarring as a kiss, the seeing her and knowing her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries not to look for her mother in the crowd, tells herself she is safe here, too many eyes to start a scene. </p><p> </p><p>Father Buchanan starts service in his usual way, something jovial in his eyes. Agatha had always known him to be good at this part, commanding a room in a way that wasn’t a demand, like bait to a fish luring in listeners with charm.</p><p> </p><p>It was born from the way he truly seemed to believe what he was speaking about, the passion, the beauty of life. If not a mechanism for finding believers, Father Buchanan was a testament to standing for morality, even allowing followers to find their own. </p><p> </p><p>“We have a guest speaker today,” He changes his course as he speaks about today’s mass, clasping his hands in gratitude, “A pillar in the church.”</p><p> </p><p>No. It can’t be.</p><p> </p><p>”Evanora,” he calls, one hand up as if to shepherd her, the woman appearing then out of a side door, a cue, a mark for her to make. </p><p> </p><p>Fuck. What the fuck is happening?</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand tightens around Agatha’s knee, a tangible weight keeping her connected to the world, a spiral of doom waiting to unravel. </p><p> </p><p>The older woman holds her bible tightly, the serious set in her features undisturbed, a mask to protect her reputation, unflinching, like Agatha had no means to shake her. </p><p> </p><p>It feels like a bad dream, a chorus of brutalized screams in the back of her mind.</p><p> </p><p>Wake up, wake the fuck up!</p><p> </p><p>But, Rio’s hand is firm, the warmth of it spilling over into her fear. And Rio’s voice, a whisper pressed close to her ear.</p><p> </p><p>”We should leave.”</p><p> </p><p>A soft invitation, it’s not a question, but it still gives Agatha a chance to disagree, a solid arc of direction, pointed but giving room for different follow through.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head no, swallows, trains her eyes forward, places her own hand over Rio’s. She isn’t running. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe it’s safer this way. A more effective way to communicate between mother and daughter. The physical distance. The way Evanora can’t directly admonish her from behind the podium. </p><p> </p><p>There isn’t much preamble, a stern clearing of her throat, Father Buchanan sitting behind the altar, Evanora pulling the small microphone closer. Flipping through her bible to find a sticky note in place of a bookmark, a few orange pieces sticking out of the top. </p><p> </p><p>”Proverbs 3:5-7,” She begins, gazing up to allow a moment for everyone to find the passage in their own bibles, “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths. Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord, and turn away from evil.”</p><p> </p><p>It sinks in like a sharp pain, a stabbing, the words spilling over the walls, a sudden cold that goes beyond the broken air conditioner, the draft from the holes they’ve never patched up. Agatha doesn’t need Evanora’s critical analysis, but she gives it anyway.</p><p> </p><p>”As a principal, I see so many young people straying from the path God has set for them. Evil can be alluring, but it is not in God’s will. I invite all the young people here today to rejoice in their faith, reaffirm your love for the Lord and follow his word.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach churns, she glances at Rio to find the other girl gnawing on her own lip, a nervous method of coping, an extreme amount of control in keeping the rest of her body still, excluding the gentle movement of her thumb on Agatha’s knee, still there, patient, unyielding. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora clears her throat again, and Agatha knows the intended purpose when she turns to meet her mother’s eyes, a demand without words to focus, to stop this, a line of steep sin in the way Agatha dared to show up here with the very person she’d told her to stay away from, after getting caught kissing a girl, skipping school for 3 days, not returning home.</p><p> </p><p>A fire in her eyes that only Agatha can read. </p><p> </p><p>She isn’t done. </p><p> </p><p>“Revelations 21:8” Evanora starts again, her eyes staying on Agatha for an extra beat before turning down to read, “But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, isolators, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”</p><p> </p><p>”Agatha,” Rio’s whisper comes again, something close to a plea, “You don’t have to sit through this.”</p><p> </p><p>”No, I don’t,” Agatha finally meets her eyes, a swirl of hardened protectiveness in brown irises, a watch dog waiting to be let off the leash, a reminder for Agatha that now is the time to conceal her own emotions, make her mother believe she is just as uneffected, “But I deserve to know what she really thinks of me.”</p><p> </p><p>”Revelations offers us the knowledge of consequences, eternal burning.” Evanora’s eyes tick over the crowd, a clock finding each new second, “Motivation to keep us devoted to his teachings.”</p><p> </p><p>”She’s trying to scare me,” Agatha says under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>”It’s not working,” Rio supplies without hesitation, like it isn’t an observation, but something she knows. </p><p> </p><p>“Hebrews 3:12,” Evanora’s pause isn’t as long, something sharp and pensive, a flick of impatience as her nostrils twitch, a crumb of anger, whisked away as soon as Agatha had seen it, “Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God.”</p><p> </p><p>The verbal slap slings over both their faces, an unsettling that even Rio’s parents feel, a small sound of surprise coming from the other side of Rio, recognition at what exactly Evanora was trying to say.</p><p> </p><p>”I leave you today with a final thought. You are the company you keep. If you surround yourself with liars, with homosexuals, with degenerates, you are a sinner as well.”</p><p> </p><p>”Are we the degenerates?” Mr. Vidal asks, still hushed as Evanora steps down, the organ above them starting a new hymn, Father Buchanan standing, his hands up, calling on the Lord. </p><p> </p><p>“No, but we are the homosexuals”</p><p> </p><p>Rio slaps her own hand over her mouth, her eyes as wide as Agatha has ever seen them, like the girl was shocked at her own words, stuck in the new reality where she couldn’t take it back. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries not to pay attention to the people that turn to glare at the commotion, the full church creating a need to sit close to other church-goers, but the caring-what-people-think trait is still too ingrained.</p><p> </p><p>”Rio,” Agatha chirps, unsure of where she wants it to land, a warning for a punishment, an echo of her surprise, a comforting reminder that she’s right beside her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mother raises her eyebrows, smug, a cautious smirk.</p><p> </p><p>”That’s how you chose to do that, chispita?” She chuckles, as soft and contained as she can between the four of them.</p><p> </p><p>”Hush, the priest is speaking.” Mr. Vidal reminds them, like he’s setting his three girls back on their course.</p><p> </p><p>And yeah, Father Buchanan is speaking, but Agatha is tuning it out.</p><p> </p><p>She holds onto Rio’s hand, feels the small change in the way Rio’s shoulders fall slightly, a tension simmering out of her, replaced with something still, something resilient. </p><p> </p><p>Because Evanora had just gone up there to publicly ridicule her like it was some Bible riddle, a Jesus maze to get caught in, a trap, always a trap.</p><p> </p><p>It felt like a certainty, Agatha wasn’t falling into it this time. </p><p> </p><p>Not with the way Rio’s mother grabs her daughter’s other hand, a presence that tells them all that Rio’s slip up would bear no consequences, that it didn’t present a reason to step back, a time for reprieve, like perhaps they already knew, were just waiting for Rio to say it. </p><p> </p><p>It undoes the triumphant anxiety of her own mother’s words, the fear they were meant to instill floats away with the callous weapon of a book meant to keep the masses malleable. Evanora can’t touch her here. Not with her hands. Not with her words.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha has something new to worship. </p><p> </p>

<p>Leviticus 17:11- For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is in the blood that makes atonement for one’s life.</p><p> </p><p>The creaking of church pews settles her mind. Something tangible in Rio and her parents sat next to her. The tidal wave had done its emotional damage, Evanora building a sword from her status in the church. Her mother had swung, and her mother had missed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had an army of her own now. No longer imprisoned in a high tower. The knight had come to free her, granted Agatha her own path. The gravel bit into her heels as she ran, but the wounds had healed. The scars left by Evanora still stung, but it only served as a reminder to stay away. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand remained in her for the rest of mass. Something solid. The spiral of anxiety leaking out drop by drop, the knowledge that Evanora’s hold was broken, unable to repair. </p><p> </p><p>It felt like a truth she’d known for a while, but something she had to accept. That she didn’t have to use the Bible as a weapon. That there could be room to find the parts of this that didn’t condemn her. That her feelings for Rio were beautiful, a means of pulling herself out of the patterns of abuse. This sin, the one her mother spoke of, didn’t exist in the way Rio looked at her, the way she strokes her skin like she only deserves to be handled gently, the way she kisses her like she is God’s favorite creation. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows Evanora probably isn’t done trying. Is too determined to give up on clawing at her just yet. But sitting here now. The promise of her mother’s heat doesn’t punch her in the gut, doesn’t stir her out of her seat, doesn’t shake her out of Rio’s hold. </p><p> </p><p>Instead she digs her heels in. Perhaps softening herself to Rio had given her the room to face Evanora more harshly, the way walls hadn’t exactly fallen but shifted. Agatha was finally letting Rio in, shutting her mother out. </p><p> </p><p>When Mass ends, the crowd never flows out of the church like a gentle river, instead people linger, families greeting each other, wishing each other well. So there isn’t a means for a quick escape. </p><p> </p><p>Father Buchanan approaches with a smile, a cautious benevolence.</p><p> </p><p>”Agatha, It’s so nice to see you. We miss your services as an altar girl,” he chuckles, as he reaches out to grasp her hand.</p><p> </p><p>And yes, perhaps she’d been around the church less this year since moving on from those responsibilities, but she’d still been here every Sunday. Still the image of the perfect Catholic daughter. Still, she tries to take the comment from a place of good intention.</p><p> </p><p>She feels the cold press of his fingers in her palm, a gesture of connection, something stable in its humanity, trust in the way he’d done this before. Perhaps there is safety here too. </p><p> </p><p>“Your mother told me you haven’t been home in the last few days,” his brow furrows in deep concern, truly trying to wrap his mind around it, “I know the world holds temptations, but you must return home my child.”</p><p> </p><p>”Father,” Agatha swallows, unsure how to answer him, unsure how to explain. </p><p> </p><p>She takes a brief look around, wondering how she’d gotten separated from the Vidal’s so easily. They stand a few feet away, talking to another family, their backs turned, unaware of the turmoil existing in Agatha’s immediate orbit. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s time to come home, darling,” Evanora is next to Father Buchanan when she turns back, a unit of convincing, no room to throw a fit, protest, run away. Not in the Lord’s house. </p><p> </p><p>And there isn’t a reality that exists where Agatha wants to live under that roof ever again, no world where she’d allow Evanora’s reins to tighten again, but maybe there does need to be some semblance of a conversation, even if they can’t come to a mutual understanding, Agatha needs to say her peace, finally get the things drowning her off her chest. Tell them to the one person who created the monsters in her head. </p><p> </p><p>The anxiety doesn’t float away, the practiced pattern of mistreatment coating over her skin. The moment of quiet between them holds a heavy chorus, the chatter around them passing the seconds.</p><p> </p><p>”Okay.” Agatha nods, pushing down the unraveling fear, using this as another step towards freedom, at the very least wanting to show Evanora that this was the last time she’d fall under her control, set the record straight. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe it was a little selfish, needing to spit in the face of her abuser, even if in a metaphorical small way, this ploy, whatever it would consist of, felt like the final act in this tragedy. </p><p> </p><p>Father Buchanan smiles again, his teeth glinting off the sharp lighting like he’d just saved a kitten from a tree, returned the pet to their rightful owner. Agatha let him hold the joy, a place where this could breathe and not spell hatred. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks around again, searching the space the Vidals previously held, wanting to communicate to Rio without words. She doesn’t find the gentle reassurance of brown eyes, no paternal support on the wings. But perhaps it was easier this way, unsure if Rio would support her motives if she even got to explain that far, knowing that Rio would hate the idea of Agatha being left alone in the same room as Evanora, surely wanting to tag along. </p><p> </p><p>But Agatha wanted the chance at closure, the chance to defend herself in a way she hadn’t before. Standing alone didn’t have to be a bad thing, facing the abuse head on, Agatha wasn’t sure if she could stop her body from falling back into its usual reaction, just knew that her mindset had shifted enough to have hope, to believe that the outcome could be different this time. </p><p> </p><p>The pulse of anxiety follows them into the car, Evanora staying quiet even when the door shuts sealing them into the car alone. Her mother never waited long to stop holding in the hatred, often spewing her callous corrections as soon as others were out of earshot. But now, the only sounds filling the unblemished insides of Evanora’s SUV were coming from the radio, the cycle of hymns playing quiet enough to be a subliminal ploy. </p><p> </p><p>Pulling into the driveway presses them into a reality where this was never out of the norm, like Agatha had been home all along, coming home from Sunday church as mother and daughter, as they had for as long as Agatha could remember. It sparks the ritual of memory, a cavernous regret, the truth that she’d be saying goodbye to all of this for good, that none of the little moments could be salvaged, even the ones that felt like reprieve, even the ones that felt neutral. Truthfully, Agatha never expected the reality of it to bleed around her strength, to feel like something she was losing. </p><p> </p><p>The same jostle of the car as it pulled over the pothole in the driveway, the way the porch light flickered on from the movement even in the daylight, the silver cross that hung on the door, the way she had to jiggle the key to open the screen door. Small things that no one else would know about a home that held her blood in it’s walls. The echoes of hallways that could spin the tales apart from the truth, the screams of pain, the scars of deceit and neglect. </p><p> </p><p>A cocoon of drafted thesis, a book to close and never read again. Agatha would walk away from here and never be able to trace the schemes again. </p><p> </p><p>“Sit. I’ll make you some tea.” </p><p> </p><p>Evanora’s voice is startling, the soured inflection absent, replaced by something sticky and sweet, a surprise, a promise. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha listens to her command, sits at the kitchen table in her usual spot, making sure not to mess up the placemat. She sticks to the thought that this is another act, another calculated ploy, dedicating herself to letting it pan out a bit further, just to pull at the thread, unravel the knot without getting tangled in it. </p><p> </p><p>This is not Evanora. </p><p> </p><p>At least not in true form.</p><p> </p><p>The clarity in her eyes something forced. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha waits for the axe to drop. </p><p> </p><p>The kettle boils. Tea is served. A table spoon of honey. Mixed with care. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha watches the steam, waits for it to cool. Reads the Bible quote etched into the ceramic mug. </p><p> </p><p>“I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.” -John 5:25 </p><p> </p><p>Evanora finally takes her seat. Her own mug steaming. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m so glad you’re home, sweetheart.” Evanora starts, eyes downcast on her own hands, a soft smile coating her features, “I knew you’d get tired of that girl and find your way back to the Lord.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha clears her throat, the first attempt at using her own words, straying from the path her mother had always set for her to follow. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay, you’re home now. I accept your apology.”</p><p> </p><p>”I’m not apologizing.” the words creak out, sounding more aggressive in her head, reveling in the way they’d at least found the air. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora’s face morphs, eyebrows scrunching in confusion. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you think an apology is necessary to get us back on track, sweetheart?” Evanora’s voice teeters closer to its usual tone, but doesn't quite break from the careful sweetness either. </p><p> </p><p>This doesn’t feel like her life. Maybe a sitcom version, twisted to show only the brightest colors. A side character, always hidden, always beaten down, thrust into the leading role. She can’t remember her lines, or the way she’s supposed to move. But the truth of her feelings bubble up from somewhere deep. A wave she can’t push back.</p><p> </p><p>The anger kicks in like a collapsing building, the fire of it reaching her ears. Agatha is glad to already be seated, the quaking emotion feeling like a jolt she can’t contain. </p><p> </p><p>“You think you got me back that easy? You think I got a taste of freedom and want this back?” Agatha pleas, hating the way her voice sounds, broken. </p><p> </p><p>She wants to wield the anger, throw stones without emotion, but she isn’t her mother, the surge of frustration free for Evanora’s eyes to devour. </p><p> </p><p>“I think you should know your place, Agatha. I think you know the consequences of disobedience. I’ve taught you better than to run away from God. You treat your life as if it is not a blessing. You act like I haven’t sacrificed everything to make you holy. Yet all you’ve done is disrespect me.”</p><p> </p><p>Each syllable presses against Agatha’s skull like a needle, her fingers pressed firmly into the arms of the chair, white knuckling to stop herself from ripping off her own skin. Lies. A crooked retelling, the disjointed perspective of a woman she’ll never understand. </p><p> </p><p>”Mother,” Agatha begs, finding the part of her that wants to believe her mother has a heart, can still speak to reason, “We are the only two people that know what’s truly happened in this house. I’m not a kid anymore. This isn’t right.”</p><p> </p><p>The damn breaks, the crack in her voice running parallel to the tears that finally fall. It feels like a failure, a clear indication that Evanora is affecting her, it sinks in the ways they are different, Agatha actually capable of human emotion. It still stings, the curse of trauma that hasn’t left her bones, the way her mother’s cheeks remain dry, a sign that she has won.</p><p> </p><p>”You are being foolish, child.” Evanora shakes her head, the full depth of her ire embedded in each word, no longer putting on the mask of aloof grace.  “Drink your tea.”</p><p> </p><p>Dismissed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand moves on its own accord, a pattern of following orders that she can’t shake. Her fingers flex around the handle, a quiet voice in her mind that sings.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe Evanora is right. A sip of tea will do some good, relax her senses for just a moment.</p><p> </p><p>She looks into the steam, as she moves the mug towards her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Bubbles.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushes up from the table, the mug slammed against the table. Standing now, needing to move away from the truth she’d seen with her own eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Poison. Fucking poison. </p><p> </p><p>“You-,” Agatha stains, unsure how to confront it out loud, her brain still catching up, she can feel the tears dripping down her face, the cool ache that pulls at the sweat on the back of her neck, the shaking in her hands, “You rather kill me, then let me be happy.”</p><p> </p><p>”Happy?” Evanora scoffs, blowing at her own tea, still seemingly unbothered. “You’re confusing sin with love, darling.”</p><p> </p><p>”You fucking hypocrite,” Agatha seethes, her fist slamming into the wood, the pain shooting up her arm, but it finally gets Evanora to stir, her eyes widening at the act of rage, a breaking point, untamed. “You’ve pretended abuse was love my entire life, spit in my face and acted like you were teaching me right from wrong with a wooden spoon to the head. And you have the fucking nerve to judge me.”</p><p> </p><p>The fight in her ebbs out in sobs, drowning around the chorus of cries, still waiting for a reaction, needing to be acknowledged. </p><p> </p><p>“You have always been an ungrateful demon child,” Evanora finally rises from her own seat, standing close enough to scream into Agatha’s face, a fight that they’d never stood on even playing field for. “And I will not let you throw away all I’ve given you.”</p><p> </p><p>Evanora’s hands grab onto Agatha’s biceps pushing her backwards, the grip around each arm harsh and unrelenting. It doesn’t leave much time for a reaction, the thud of her own head hitting the wall behind her brings her back to reality. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels her own hands struggling to gain freedom, an attempt at breaking out of the grasp, a new approach to the mess of this, the first time she’s fighting back, the last time she’ll have to. </p><p> </p><p>“You must feel the consequences of your sins. You must face God’s wrath.” Evanora pushes her sideways, Agatha falling to the ground, her hands barely able to brace her fall, her hip and knee struck against the hardwood, “It is time to return to him, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scrambles to her feet, perhaps flight still being a better response than freeze, she sprints towards the front of the house, an attempt at making it out of the front door.</p><p> </p><p>Evanora’s full weight collides into her just as she reaches for the lock, her wrist mangled against the knob. Her mother stands above her again, a blurred image of her limitless determination, she finds the will to give in. </p><p> </p><p>In the space of her front door, one step away from freedom. </p><p> </p><p>She hears the slap more than she feels it, the echo popping off her eardrum, the cold whip against her tear stains. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs at Evanora’s wrist, pulls her down by her forearm, a final attempt.</p><p> </p><p>”You were born evil.” Her mother grits out as they crash onto the floor, swinging her fist in quick succession, making contact with the side of Agatha’s head from the odd angle. </p><p> </p><p>“And who fucking made me?” Agatha calls back, grabbing hold of the wailing fist, twisting the arm backwards.</p><p> </p><p>It doesn’t bloom closure in the way she thought it would, her mother’s pain unsatisfying.  </p><p> </p><p>Fighting back seems to only stir more anger, this middle aged woman finding all her strength in creating as much damage as possible, undeterred by her daughter’s new found ability to defend herself. </p><p> </p><p>In another attempt at quelling the fight, Evanora headbutts her in the face, the hard surface of her forehead, smacking into Agatha’s nose. She can feel the cool trickles of blood from her nostrils, the new sense of urgency sliding away.</p><p> </p><p>In the wake of trying to protect herself, Agatha realizes how exhausting it is, that perhaps she’d saved herself the hassle by taking it for years without any barriers, every push back or attempt to escape seemingly giving Evanora more like a power sucking super villain.</p><p> </p><p>The fight for power stalls at the sound of movement upstairs, a sharp thud followed by quick footsteps, a thundering pace that grows louder as the intruder descends the stairs. </p><p> </p><p>Rio. </p><p> </p><p>How the fuck-</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry to crash the tea party, Miss H.” Rio’s pace doesn’t falter as she comes to stand in front of Evanora.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t see her face, but she can hear the piercing edge, the anger that bleeds into fear, the way it's pressed down into something controlled. A brave face for them both. </p><p> </p><p>The shock shared between mother and daughter is possibly the closest thing they’ve had to a bonding experience in years. </p><p> </p><p>“You!” Evanora’s anger shoots back out, standing up in an instant, meeting Rio face to face, “The harlot that ruined my daughter.”</p><p> </p><p>”Now is that any way to talk to your future daughter in law,” Rio’s admonishes, something jovial in her tone, refusing to meet the harsh grit of Evanora’s words, “Very unbecoming of a holy woman like yourself, Miss H.”</p><p> </p><p>”Get out!” Evanora spits, not entertained by this play.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally finds the will to stand up, she reads the stiff stance of Rio’s posture, the curled fists, an attempt at preservation. She can’t meet her eyes, can’t face the vulnerability. The pressure on her head comes flooding in, a feeling that throws her off balance. Agatha doesn’t feel herself falling, just the cold sweat, the dizzying nausea, and Rio’s arms around her, keeping her up. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Rio’s voice is different, pressed into her ear, her arms so solid, her tone so soft, “It’s gonna be okay.”</p><p> </p><p>”Leave her!” Evanora spits, “She belongs with her mother.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha faintly registers Evanora clawing at her, Rio pulling her closer, cradling the back of her head. </p><p> </p><p>“You are not a mother,” Rio speaks, clear and free.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hears the sound first, the crisp slap to Rio’s face, feels the jerk of it in the wake of the sound. She pulls away without a conscious thought, turns her body towards the attack, moves herself between Evanora and Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t fucking touch her,” Agatha sobs, a yell that scratches at her throat, she makes herself the shield, the protector. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re are going to hell.” Evanora’s words come out in a heated whisper, a last chance at wielding what’s left as Rio moves them both, taking Agatha by the arm, still unsure of her stability, pulling her towards the door. The words are pressed into the air as if to shatter her child’s world. </p><p> </p><p>And a year ago that might have worked. A reminder of the veil so tightly tied around her eyes, the cautious whisper of the girl she used to be, the child who obeyed. </p><p> </p><p>“We’ll see you there.” Agatha scoffs, letting Rio pull her along.</p><p> </p><p>The front door slams behind them. The hurried steps continue, a floating sense where Agatha knows she’s moving her own feet, but she isn’t exactly feeling it. </p><p> </p><p>“How the fuck did you get here?” Agatha pulls out of Rio’s grasp, steadying herself, still processing the fact that she'd been there to witness that, unsure of where she wants to be grateful and be mad. Maybe it was the lack of understanding, or the minor concussion, but it all felt like too much.</p><p> </p><p>“Keep walking.” Rio orders, it isn’t mean, just a clear demand, her arm wrapping around Agatha again, a guide, an anchor. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll talk when we get out of here.”</p><p> </p><p>And there. That was the clarity she needed. That Rio wasn’t mad. Or at least not mad enough to let this ruin them. That they would talk. There would be room for understanding. </p><p> </p><p>That Rio wasn’t ignoring her. That Rio wanted her safe. Far away from this before they figured out how to move on. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept walking. </p><p> </p><p>A shriek of tires against pavement only makes the pain in her head worse, an older model minivan swerving to a stop on their side of the street.</p><p> </p><p>What now?</p><p> </p><p>“Get in.” Billy’s voice spills from the driver’s seat. </p><p> </p><p>Rio opens the door, helps Agatha into the backseat without much fight, the adrenaline wearing off. </p><p> </p><p>“You two okay?” He asks, eyes scanning their faces in the rear view mirror. He pulls napkins out of the glove box, shoves them into Rio’s hands.</p><p> </p><p>There isn’t a verbal answer. A poised silence. Billy trains his eyes back on the road. </p><p> </p><p>“I feel like we just robbed a bank.” He laughs nervously, tapping the steering wheel like they’re in a high speed chase, not going 25 in the suburbs.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, Billy.” Rio supplies, genuine, but still a mechanism of getting him to shut up. Rio presses the crumpled under Agatha’s nose, holds firm to stop the blood from flowing all over her, keeps her steady. </p><p> </p><p>”How did Billy know to-? How did you get here, Rio?” Agatha tries again, her brain still not computing how they had driven to church together with her parents, how Rio had somehow teleported into her house. She lets Rio stay close, tend to her nose.</p><p> </p><p>“I heard them talking to you at church,” Rio starts, choking on her own words, knowing Agatha would keep spiraling the longer she made her wait, “When I saw you agreed, I thought I’d tag along. I hopped in her trunk right before you got to the car, that woman should really learn to lock her doors.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio heard everything? Or…</p><p> </p><p>”Where-“</p><p> </p><p>”I was in the bushes, listening. When I heard yelling I climbed into your window.” Rio is sort of sheepish about it, her eyes trained on the task at hand, but not directly into her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can read the hurt, the pain in dark irises even if they never fully show themselves.</p><p> </p><p>“And Billy?”</p><p> </p><p>”uh, Rio texted me. ‘SOS’ and your address. Stole my mom’s van from the garage.” He shrugs, chancing a look back at them at a stop sign. “Speaking of. Where exactly am I supposed to be going now?” </p><p> </p><p>“Uhh,” Rio ponders out loud, obviously not planning this far ahead.</p><p> </p><p>”ooo,” Billy chirps, suddenly excited, “Do you wanna come over? My parents aren’t home. And I kind of need to be back before they realize the car is missing.”</p><p> </p><p>”Sure,” Agatha sighs, not knowing where else to go.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry if I overstepped,” Rio whispers, retracting her confidence, not knowing the full depth of the complicated emotions Agatha was feeling.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoots closer to press firmly into her side, holds onto Rio’s wrist, keeps her close. Agatha doesn’t have the words yet, but she knows this is better than what she left behind. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Ruth 1:16- But Ruth replied, “Do not urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God.”</p><p> </p><p>A calm wind tangles against the wind chime, the sounds of nature wrapping Agatha in a hold that keeps her thoughts from running grim. </p><p> </p><p>A blanket on her shoulders that doesn’t stop her from shivering. Her nervous system still quieting.</p><p> </p><p>Billy’s backyard is pretty small. She can see the next 3 yards from the back deck, tucked into a corner seat. Her nose no longer bleeding but the area still feeling dry and raw.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stands by the railing, leaned up against it, looking up at the clouds, Agatha can only see the side of her face. </p><p> </p><p>Billy brings out a snack board with sliced apples, mixed nuts, capri suns, doing his best to play the part of a good host. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll be inside if you need anything.” He says awkwardly, drawing more attention to the silence, the delicate bubbling of processing before he disappears back inside. </p><p> </p><p>“Why’d you go with her?” Rio asks after a few more moments of cautious wind and no words, she doesn’t sound angry, halted static to the way she holds her body so taught. </p><p> </p><p>The windchime wrinkles the sound between them. A third person in their conversation. She lets the wind speak before opting for her own turn. </p><p> </p><p>“Closure maybe.” Agatha shrugs. “Give her a chance to come to her senses.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods. </p><p> </p><p>“I never intended to stay there. Or not tell you where I was going.” Agatha tries to clarify. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry.” She tacks on. Meaning it. Really fucking meaning it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns to her, the sadness in her face trembling like a quiet surrender. A heartbreaking truth to the stories she’d only heard from Agatha’s mouth. It’s not like she didn’t believe her, but seeing Evanora in action was something different.</p><p> </p><p>She steps forward into Agatha’s space, her hands on her face. Rio places a delicate kiss onto her hairline, stays close even after the graze of her lips. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m just glad you’re okay.” She whispers into her skin, a solid confession that floats over the broken in her voice. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s arms pull her closer around the waist, an awkward angle as she remains seated, but she pushes forward, her face pressed firmly into Rio’s chest, needing the tangible reminder of her existence, sighing at the reality of Rio’s heart beat pulsing against her ear. </p><p> </p><p>“I should have known better,” Agatha sobs into her, mad at herself for giving Evanora a chance to redeem herself, a hair of room to weasel her way back in, even if they’d escaped. </p><p> </p><p>Rio only holds her tighter, scratches at the nape of her neck. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re not wrong for wanting her to act like a mother.” Rio tries, her voice soft, a careful press of solid wishes, a truth she needs Agatha to hear, “I could never blame you for that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls back slightly, needing to see Rio’s face, wanting with everything in her to kiss her. She slides her hand over Rio’s collar bone, finds brown eyes that allow tears to fall too, an oath they’d both taken to feel their feelings out in the open. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry I let her hit you,” Agatha’s voice breaks as her hand glides over her cheek, a stroke of her fingers over the same spot Evanora had assaulted. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s fingers lace around her wrist, shaking her head. </p><p> </p><p>“Stop apologizing for her.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods.</p><p> </p><p>Tilting her head up to further enter her space, pushing up to slide forward to connect their lips. Rio doesn’t hesitate to meet her half way, a calming sigh that slides from Rio’s mouth into hers, a searing breath that reminds them both of the passion that only spoke in their silence. A place to return to, a comfort in the soaring flame. </p><p> </p><p>“Am I hurting your nose?” Rio whispers into her, a spilled out moment of making sure.</p><p> </p><p>”Shut up and let me kiss you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can feel the upturn of RIo’s lips against her, the temptation of a smirk hiding in the clash of lips, the droplet of amusement in the bucket of doom, something to cling to, knowing tomorrow has the room to be better. </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>James 1:2- Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds</p><p> </p><p>By the time Rio is turning her key in the door, the afternoon heat has set in. The sting of sweat nips at the back of Agatha’s neck, a dense fear of awaiting gloom. She isn’t sure what they’ll find inside, the tides that will turn from their presence, the unfurling explanation of events. </p><p> </p><p>The unknown has always been an easy thing to stress over, but the pattern of acceptance was starting to rewire Agatha’s brain, the angel on her shoulder coaxing her out of a renewed panic attack.</p><p> </p><p>It’s just Rio’s parents. They care about her. They love her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mother is at the door as it opens, fussing over them, taking them into her arms, looking over them to confirm they’re both okay, caressing Rio’s cheek, squeezing Agatha’s shoulder. She curses under her breath in Spanish as she moves. </p><p> </p><p>“Where’s Papa?” Rio breathes, finally able to find words. </p><p> </p><p>“He went back to the church about an hour ago, he thought maybe you’d go back there.” Mrs. Vidal sighs, “I’ve been calling you nonstop where have you two been?” the timber in her voice growing, teetering back towards anger now knowing they were safe.</p><p> </p><p>”Mami,” Rio grabs her by the shoulders, “Let me call Papa and tell him to come home, okay?” She tries to calm her, somehow striking back as the voice of reason. </p><p> </p><p>“Mierda, Chispita, I’m not thinking straight.” </p><p> </p><p>“Here,” Agatha steps in, taking her hands, “Let’s sit down.” They step towards the couch as Rio pulls out her phone, taking a seat together on the sofa. </p><p> </p><p>Mrs. Vidal pulls Agatha into her, a safe connection, a maternal warmth that sinks through the layers of skin, she caresses Agatha’s hair, looks at her with gentle worry, still overcome by their previous absence. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Papa, we’re safe.” Rio says into her phone, Agatha swears she can hear her father’s relieved sigh even with the phone held up to Rio’s ear. </p><p> </p><p>They sit in silence while they wait for his return, the TV playing reruns of family feud, Agatha content to stay in the proximity of Mrs. Vidal. </p><p> </p><p>Rio meets him at the door as he arrives, letting him pull her into him, the cocoon of his body holding her like a shield.</p><p> </p><p>”Aye, Rio. We were so worried.” His voice aches between anguish and fear, the reality that his daughter had vanished for hours without a word.</p><p> </p><p>They sit in the living room. Her father in his designated chair, Rio perched on the armrest, Agatha and Mrs. Vidal still sat on the other section of couch.</p><p> </p><p>They don’t rehash it all, just mark the occasion as a continuation of abuse, Rio does most of the talking, places the responsibility on herself for not telling them where they were going, allows Agatha the room to add in necessary details.</p><p> </p><p>It feels like a dust cloud, something lethargic in freeing the words from the cage in her chest. Agatha sort of understands why people go to therapy. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry for dragging Rio into this.” Agatha offers, earnestly, feeling for the first time the care of a family, knowing the pain of losing it.</p><p> </p><p>”You didn’t drag me into anything.” Rio shakes her head, brown eyes welling slightly, “I followed, that was my choice.”</p><p> </p><p>“She’s always been protective, Agatha,” Mr. Vidal recalls wistfully, seemingly less on edge after knowing where they were, that Rio had followed in an attempt to keep Agatha safe. “None of us are going to change that.” He adds with resigned acceptance.</p><p> </p><p>They don’t talk about the poison, or the wicked intentions, an unspoken choice in the way Rio’s eyes darken, Agatha swallows harshly, a sense of worry that doesn’t need to reach her parent’s ears. </p><p> </p><p>Regardless, they don’t let Agatha hold the blame, a reassurance with gentle words, the way Rio’s mother never loses the grip on her hand. </p><p> </p><p>“I called CPS.” Mrs. Vidal confesses, her head in her hands, needing to get the truth out before it consumed her.</p><p> </p><p>”Mami,” Rio scolds, angry but unsurprised.</p><p> </p><p>”She wanted to call 911, too,” Her father chimes, “You should be glad I convinced her to wait a few more hours.”</p><p> </p><p>”It’s okay,” Agatha sighs, “I’ll deal with it.”</p><p> </p><p>”They said they have to investigate the report, they might try to speak to you about everything, but hopefully it will help.”</p><p> </p><p>”I’m just waiting to be 18.” Agatha explains, resigned to the reality that she knows how this will play out, Evanora using her power to get out of any consequences, “there’s no point in being placed in foster care or getting emancipated when I’m going to be a legal adult in 3 months.”</p><p> </p><p>”I’m sorry.” Mrs. Vidal whispers, “I wasn’t trying to make this harder.”</p><p> </p><p>”I know.”</p><p> </p><p>It sings to all the times that Evanora had never apologized for things with evil intent, that Rio’s mother had so innately offered her love and care, that she was apologizing when she was only trying to help, it weighed heavy on the truth, a reminder that she’d walked away, but there was nothing there to lose, that leaving Evanora only meant walking closer towards this. The intention of people who valued her health, her feelings, who wanted her to thrive. </p><p> </p><p>Part of it still feels like a fairytale, a lost dream that she can’t touch, sliding away as she tries to grasp its edges, but Rio’s eyes feel solid, the unwavering press of support. A reminder that stepping into the unknown is scary, but she doesn’t have to do it alone, tethered instead to the people who are willing to catch her if she falls. </p><p> </p><p>“Sooo,” Rio adjusts herself on the arm of the chair, the conversation coming to a natural end, she teeters on finding the right words, a moment of silence that could last forever. “The gay thing?”</p><p> </p><p>To anyone else, Rio isn’t moved by the new conversation, unafraid of the chance at rejection, but Agatha can hear the ache in the mid tone of her voice, knows the anxious movement of her fingers.</p><p> </p><p>”We kind of figured,” Mrs. Vidal shrugs, smiles, all warmth and patience, like she would have waited forever for her daughter to be ready to say it out loud. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s head swings to face her father, gauges his reaction too, takes in the way he nods, chuckles at the way Rio seems genuinely surprised.</p><p> </p><p>”But I was so good at hiding it!” Rio shrieks, exasperated. </p><p> </p><p>The high pitched lilt stirs a laugh from Agatha as well, a curtain of happiness that shields her from the harsh tricks of the light. </p><p> </p><p>“Have you seen the way you look at her?” Mr. Vidal chimes in, nodding his head towards Agatha as he directs the question at his daughter, “We’re not blind.”</p><p> </p><p>”Woah,” Rio hops up, fully standing now, ready to get to the bottom of this, “What if Agatha wasn’t into me? You totally blew up my spot with that.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, so you two are together?” Mrs. Vidal laughs, getting the exact confirmation they needed. </p><p> </p><p>“Dude,” Agatha admonishes, “You just fell into their trap.”</p><p> </p><p>”I’m dumb,” Rio face palms, realizing too late that she’d probably just sabotaged the chances of Agatha continuing to sleep in her room. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re not dumb, Chispita. Just a useless lesbian.” Her father teases without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>”Where did you learn that?” Rio’s head snaps back up, “Mami, take his phone. He’s not allowed on the internet anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly, there isn’t a conversation about Agatha sleeping in the guest room. No teasing statements about using protection, just a sharp look of support, a kiss to Rio’s forehead, a hug that makes Agatha feel like she might shatter. </p><p> </p><p>They order food, never setting the table, keeping the comfort of the living room. Rio fills cups with juice, Agatha grabs forks. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her softly when they’re alone in the kitchen, almost spills. It’s a swirl of concern, no regret, just something steady and blooming, witnessing the resilience in the way they were both still standing in the wake of unspeakable events, sharing a moment that was just them again.</p><p> </p><p>Circling like orbiting planets, never too far away, always due to crash back together. </p><p> </p><p>“Let me take one before you drop something, clumsy” Agatha teases, a breath of something that feels normal, Agatha being nice to be mean.</p><p> </p><p>”Agatha,” Rio smiles sadly, a course of trying to hold it together after her front row seat to the show, still processing, a burden that would take time to sort through, her hand clenched around the plastic cup, her fingers standing in for the harsh grasp on her resolve. </p><p> </p><p>“Give me the cup, Rio.” Agatha coaxes it out of her hand gently, presses a kiss to her cheek, waits for the resounding exhale. </p><p> </p><p>Rio tucks between Agatha and her mother on the couch, they all wordlessly eat, someone turns on The Parent Trap, a movie they’d all seen a million times. Agatha tries to offer silent connection, their thighs touching, Rio’s elbow resting against her ribs as she eats.</p><p> </p><p>It’s a sturdy comfort. The warm food in her hands, placed there as an unquestioned necessity. The ease of company, the seamless wheel of care always turning. The gentle quiet of no expectations to say the right thing, to fall in line.</p><p> </p><p>For the first time in a long time, existence felt more like a choice, a careful path that opened up, direction unclear.</p><p> </p><p>The story altered by her own hand. </p><p> </p><p>It was scary, not having the next chapter seared into the Earth by God’s hand, by Evanora’s guidance, but it felt like power, a sense she’d learned to like, power in her words, in her voice. </p><p> </p><p>The truth of it surged through Agatha like a crystalline current, a torch of lilac fire. A taste of something she wanted more of. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s room starts to feel like a safe haven. Less than a week of this and she’s already sleeping much better. Maybe it’s the security of Rio next to her, the warmth and continuity. Maybe it’s the softness of the blankets, the perfect tilt of Rio’s night light (that Agatha switched to purple without asking), the background noise from the fan. Maybe it’s the true knowledge of safety, the ability to fall deeply into sleep without having to keep her guard up. </p><p> </p><p>She thinks all of it plays a role, the routine of brushing her teeth next to Rio, feeling like someone is holding her accountable. </p><p> </p><p>There’s a soft knock at Rio’s bedroom door, her mother’s head poking in as it opens.</p><p> </p><p>Luckily, there isn’t anything to hide, Agatha tucked in by the wall, her head barely visible, Rio sitting up on the foot of the bed in shorts and an oversized t-shirt, remote in hand clicking through Netflix. </p><p> </p><p>“Your father and I were talking.” She starts, directed to the room and not just Rio, a sense of belonging to the conversation, “No school tomorrow. We don’t want either of you under that woman’s finger until we can get a better idea of how to deal with this. Understood?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns to look at Agatha, a sharp line of care and compassion, a wide berth of honesty, valuing the opinion to find in blue eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels herself nodding before she can think to negate this, her head scratching against the pillow, exhausted, willing to give Rio her voice for the time being. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio turns back to her mother, the cool resignation, a firmness in the way she took non verbal orders from the girl in her bed. </p><p> </p><p>It feels unmistakably easy, a sprinkler system set to water the grass at the same time every other day, a practiced pattern of the hard parts ironed out. Agatha starts to wonder if this is simply what she’s been missing. That life will never be perfect, the next storm always rolling over the horizon, but she finds comfort in the way Rio will always be waiting with a towel to dry her off.</p><p> </p><p>She thinks of Lilia, the crash of waves on the shore of her childhood, before she was old enough to know her family was different, that her dealt hand was sour and rotten, crops always yielded at the wrong time. She thinks of smiling with her as they colored at the kitchen table, the fruit Lilia would cut for her. </p><p> </p><p>It pops back in glimpses, happy memories, the ones often shadowed by images of closed fists and the hollow feeling of an empty stomach. The curtain opens on a new day, a promise for sunlight and an attempt at something better.</p><p> </p><p>She thinks of Alice, of Jen. The assured innocence of being kids that didn’t have all the answers, the companionship that didn’t have to feel forced or held to be greater than it was. But a choice to make the icy monotony of high school a little less gray.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s parents. A caress so gentle, she’d never cowered away from it. It felt like quick sand, a pleasant suffocation, a weighted blanket that never grew too hot. The example of love on display without pomp and circumstance, just two people who would bend the world for each other offering her a life jacket, making sure she doesn’t drown, only asking for her truth in return.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio pulls back the covers and slides into bed next to her, she doesn’t unwrap Agatha’s cocoon, but she brushes some hair out of her face, glides her fingers over her cheek, soothing and small. She watches as brown eyes grow heavy as they trace a careful path along her features, the sequence of breathing falling slow. </p><p> </p><p>Rio swings in like a gust of wind, close and unafraid. She presses her lips to her forehead, over the bridge of Agatha’s nose, a sleepy smile at the way Agatha scrunches her face in response. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilts her head, finds the space to take what she wants, kisses Rio like it might break them both. She waits for the surge of warmth to coat her, the swirling beat of a song she can’t remember the name of, just the pulse of Rio’s heart, the melody that sings the same as Rio sighs into her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>Rio. And the way this has always felt like coming home. A trust that bled from the way Rio had never offered judgement, had wanted her more than she’d allow herself to realize, had pushed down her feelings in favor of letting Agatha choose for so long. </p><p> </p><p>Rio. And how she worshiped her like a God, the church bells ringing in her ears every time brown eyes met their match. A willing participant in the chaos, protection and growth, a pretty petal of peace. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m obsessed with you.” Rio whispers against her lips, Agatha letting out an amused breath, content in the way Rio was happy to share her thoughts. </p><p> </p><p>“Please tell me more,” Agatha slides her arms out from under the blanket, rolls to press her body over Rio’s, hold her tightly against the bed, make her confess to all her desires. </p><p> </p><p>Rio grunts, squirming slightly in the new position, “What do you wanna hear?”</p><p> </p><p>”What are you thinking about right now?” Agatha teases, hushes against the shell of Rio’s ear, nipping at her neck. </p><p> </p><p>“Baby,” Rio’s voice cracks slightly as she begs for some semblance of mercy. </p><p> </p><p>The power of it drives Agatha a little mad, the way Rio had been reduced to a puddle of want, her hands firmly pressed into Agatha’s back, wanting to be squished under her weight. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m waiting.”</p><p> </p><p>“Your personality is okay, but you’re extremely hot,” Rio teases back, unwilling to fully give in just yet. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushes up to straddle her, grabs Rio’s arms, presses her wrists into the mattress above her head.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tracks the way Rio inhales deeply, feels the press of Rio’s hips in between her thighs, her blood pumping harshly in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m sorry I don’t think I heard you, can you repeat that?” Agatha offers, sickenly sweet, giving Rio the chance to rethink her answer. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re like the strongest person I know,” Rio’s voice is melting her, the sudden genuine lilt, Rio’s muscles unclenching, it feels like an attack, the chorus of a compliment still murky against the shield on her brain. “You’re dramatic and silly, and a little evil.” She laughs at her own words, caught by Agatha’s gaze slicing into her, Rio presses her fingers into the wound, eager to find the bullet and fish it out, let the opening finally start healing, “But I want all of it. Your pretty eyes and cute nose are just a bonus.”</p><p> </p><p>”My nose is not cute!” Agatha pulls away, the defensive nature finally winning out, she turns away, covering her face with the blanket. The echo of her mother’s scrutiny present but quieter than usual.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me see” Rio giggles as she coaxes the blanket free from Agatha’s death grip, as if she was asking to see a boo boo a child was trying to hide from their parents. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pouts up at her as she leans down to kiss the tip of her nose, before she fakes a bite out of it, an aggressive chomp in Agatha’s personal space. </p><p> </p><p>“Did you just eat my nose?” </p><p> </p><p>“Yes. It was delicious.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls Rio in, instigates the cuddling position before she can think to push her away, the swirl of ease in her stomach clicking as another reminder to stay. Rio’s head on her collar bone, arms secure around her torso, Agatha’s around her shoulders, one hand scratching at Rio’s scalp. </p><p> </p><p>It comes as an afterthought as their breathing syncs, like rocking a newborn to sleep, eyelids falling heavy with each new second. </p><p> </p><p>“You also have great boobs.” Rio whispers into the stillness. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand gives her a light slap to the shoulder as punishment even as she laughs softly. </p><p> </p><p>“Go to bed, brat.” </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>1 Peter 2:2 - Like newborn infants, desire the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow up into your salvation.</p><p> </p><p>They were about to be legal adults, a few more weeks of high school, a few more months before 18 came swinging like a baseball bat to the face. But Agatha still felt 7, wondering why Lilia had stopped visiting her. She still felt 12, pressing her hands over open wounds. She remembers 15, Rio close enough to feel but never hold onto. </p><p> </p><p>She can’t believe Rio is trusted enough to buy groceries, her father’s credit card haphazardly tucked into the pocket of her shorts. Because Rio has always rocked between the worlds of old soul and aloof child, like a pendulum swing to keep her on her toes. A wisdom woven into the chaotic quilt of her heart. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha values the complexity, how Rio could never fit in one box, how Agatha would always fall into too many categories to count, how they’d still melded together like ridged puzzle pieces that oozed into a single goo. </p><p> </p><p>She pushes the cart into Rio’s butt, jostling the girl forward into the orange juice in front of her, clinging to the door handle for stability. </p><p> </p><p>“I told you to wear your crocs in sport mode,” Agatha chastises, like she hadn’t been the cause of the issue, watching Rio give her a death glare as she slides her foot back into her lost shoe. </p><p> </p><p>“But they’re for leisure,” Rio tries, placing the carton of juice into the half full cart, “Don’t you see my lil Shrek charm? he’s vibing.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, amused by the light green crocs adorned with random gibbets, Rio’s mismatched socks. She can’t help the disgust on her face as she eyes the orange juice.</p><p> </p><p>”Don’t tell me you like pulp” Rio halts her movements as if Agatha’s answer would change their fate.</p><p> </p><p>”I don’t really like orange juice.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyebrows furrow, staring at her for a moment, calculating her next move.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve been sharing my oranges with you at lunch for years. You don’t like oranges?” Rio asks like she’s contemplating their entire friendship.</p><p> </p><p>”No. Not really.” Agatha shrugs, obviously not thinking this would be groundbreaking news. </p><p> </p><p>“And you never said anything? I’ve been force feeding you something you didn’t like for years.”</p><p> </p><p>”We’re blocking the old lady from getting her-“ Agatha tries to deflect, starts pushing the cart again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabs hold of the other side, stops it from moving.</p><p> </p><p>”The old lady can wait.”</p><p> </p><p>”Move, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffs like she’s an 8 year old withheld from her third cupcake, but turns around and follows orders, walks in front as Agatha follows behind. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha watches the tension in Rio’s shoulders, tries to quell the pocket of embarrassment in her own heart. It felt stupid and minuscule, like a detail she forgot to mention, it felt wounding and monumental, that pushing away anything gifted by Rio had always felt like an unforgivable sin. </p><p> </p><p>They didn’t have to say the hard part out loud, that Agatha was manipulated by her mother with a lack of food, that maybe Agatha felt like she should take anything she could get. The other piece is perhaps the fear to speak up, an upending weight in asking for something she truly wants.</p><p> </p><p>Untying all the haunted behaviors would take time, relearning how to exist without the war of her mother’s grief sitting on her shoulders. This wasn’t the first time they were reminded of it, the effect longer lasting than any simple change of heart, this wouldn’t be the last. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t want to hold all of the blame anymore, didn’t want to break herself over the evil her mother had embedded under her skin. So here she was, in front of the milk, cornering Rio in with the shopping cart, trying to turn the page on pushing hard things away, attempting to be vulnerable. </p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t purposely lying,” she starts, still jarred by the way Rio never seemed thrown by her back and forth, patient and waiting for the pressure of struggle to quake into new buds, “I just forgot I had a voice, I’m still remembering.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, not crowding over the open wound, continuing to look at the cheese options, leaving space to breathe, let the words sink in. </p><p> </p><p>“I also had a massive crush on you,” Agatha admits like a well kept secret, seeking the attention of Rio’s eyes, ready to face the pride directed at her for once, “So, how could I refuse?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles, turns her head. </p><p> </p><p>“A crush? That’s crazy!” </p><p> </p><p>Brown eyes shine like she might explode from the ease of it, the tilt of amused eyebrows as she laughs at her own comment, turns the tide over towards joy. Agatha knows in all the waves that they’ll always come back to this cool breeze of teasing and play, the river of adoration flooding just under the tree line. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, but can’t help the smile on her own lips, solace in returning here time and time again, a place in their hearts layed out whenever they roam, today just happens to be in the dairy section. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Mark 10:9- Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.</p><p> </p><p>The afternoon is barely upon them when they get back to the house, the steady creak of Rio’s car pulling into the driveway is starting to feel like a welcome sign, a sharp presence to mark the stability of home.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs as many bags in her hands as she can, Rio telling her two trips wasn’t an option (only for losers). The ache in her fingers as she sets them down on the kitchen island surges like a pleasant pain, a battle wound, the consequences of family. </p><p> </p><p>They organize the items seamlessly, taking them out of bags and sorting them where they belong. There aren’t words, no pre-plan, just the simple facets of knowing each other’s movements enough to work together effortlessly. It had tugged at Agatha for a long time, knowing it was never just an emotional dependency, never an isolated physical attraction, but that they made a good team, could conquer group projects and science labs, collaboration and sincerity in building solid foundations or even just put the groceries away. </p><p> </p><p>Rio has to push up on her tippy toes to reach the highest shelf in the pantry, her socks sliding her slightly against the hardwood. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha presses in close behind her, not exactly to catch her or boost her up, but for the sake of the closeness, her arms wrapping around her, Agatha’s nose pressed into Rio’s shoulder blade. </p><p> </p><p>It soars a new chase of desire, the clench in her chest as Rio melts back into the touch, secures Agatha’s hands around her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha will never get tired of this, the tangible elation in her bones, the chorus of enlightenment at any instigation of touch. It feels charged now, a blanket of safety coated in anticipation, a change to her breathing, kissing delicately at the side of Rio’s neck. It feels like salvation, a chance at forgiveness, a chance to exist in the light. </p><p> </p><p>For once it’s a feeling that she chases.</p><p> </p><p>She rubs her hands over Rio’s hips, uses her power to mold her, turns her around, breathing her in.</p><p> </p><p>It’s not a plan, no conversations of lines to be crossed or new worlds to tackle, but Agatha can’t help the look in her eyes, the unblemished want in the oceans of blue, she can feel the heat in her face, the magnetic pull, the jolt of something in her gut that glues her to Rio’s body. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha knows Rio sees it, can feel the shakiness in her hands against her rib cage, the wicked gasp against her lips as they kiss. Still, full of a passion and patience Agatha could never undo, but a new layer added, something powerful and aching. A desperate yearning that crashes between them, a balanced chaos of lips, and hands, and breathing. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs at Rio’s shirt, waits for the scorching yelp that follows. She thinks to drag her upstairs, use her dedicated will to force Rio forward, until she realizes the waste of energy, finds the easier way to wield her power. </p><p> </p><p>“Take me upstairs,” Agatha doesn’t ask, it would be a useless use of a question mark, high off the way Rio grabs at her thighs and starts to move without any other prompting, unconcerned with the insecurity of being vulnerable. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s room is as they left it, the bed unmade, the TV remote tangled in the sheets, the pillows angled close. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha is pulling Rio down before she can care to hit the brakes on this, her pulse whining with an unparalleled need, her body asking for this clearly. And her mind isn’t protesting, the sharp electricity shadowing her like a comfort. This doesn’t feel like a sin anymore. </p><p> </p><p>It feels like connection. Rio chasing Agatha’s mouth with her own, never wanting to be a moment without her lips, the gentle press forward, the tangled war of finding the right pace. </p><p> </p><p>It feels like protection. Sharing this with the person she trusts the most, to keep her safe from her past, from the fear, from the danger in her own mind. </p><p> </p><p>It feels like power. Making the choice, wanting and being wanted in return. </p><p> </p><p>It isn’t a rush, it isn’t an accident.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha can’t wait much longer, the excitement twisted in with the contorted limbs. </p><p> </p><p>She pushes Rio back enough to take off her shirt, presses hands over sharp shoulders, traces over Rio’s sternum as her other hand pulls her back into the kiss. A tumble akin to a cartoon wrestling match, that ends with Agatha sat in Rio’s lap, straddling her, she finds the clasp on the back of Rio’s bra, undoes it with the precision of an expert. </p><p> </p><p>The moment gives her new confidence, marked solidly with a bite to Rio’s bottom lip. </p><p> </p><p>She checks in slightly, spurred on by the way Rio grabs at her just as fervently, connecting blue and brown for a second before focusing back on pulling away the bra from Rio’s body. </p><p> </p><p>Rio squeezes on Agatha’s hips as the first contact is made to her chest, a whisper of a noise leaving her mouth, swallowed quickly behind Agatha’s lips. She isn’t sure what exactly she’s doing, but she explores the soft weight in her hands, rubs over pert nipples, catalogs each new lilt of breath, she pulls gently at first, squeezes and soothes.</p><p> </p><p>The tactile revelation only feeds into the desire for more, she wants to see, she wants to taste.</p><p> </p><p>”Agatha,” Rio breathes out like a warning sigh, afraid she might stop, afraid she’s ruined her already. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha watches her own hand pressed over sensitive flesh, circling her thumb once more before lowering her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>The first of Rio’s moans reach her ears like a symphony, an earth shattering echo that no church organ could ever come close to, the firm hold Rio has on the back of her head, her fingertips tangling in her long hair as she uses her tongue and teeth, sucking and licking, an attempt at coaxing out more sounds. </p><p> </p><p>It swells like ownership, a possession that Agatha was happy to take root in. </p><p> </p><p>The heat of it only grows when Rio clenches harder, pulls her up by the hair to kiss her again, the languid pace morphing as she flips them over, takes Agatha’s help graciously in removing her shirt and bra as well.</p><p> </p><p>The attention is equally returned, Rio’s obsession renewed as she takes her turn, drowning herself against Agatha’s chest until she leaves behind reddened flesh and wet nipples. The weight in her core grows, spreading out from her stomach lower, keeping her close, needing to see this end. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth remains on a mission, attentive over sharp ribs, worshipping every birthmark, Agatha has to remind herself to breathe, remind herself to stay present, hold onto each step closer like a labor of peace, never wanting to forget.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands find a home at the waistband of Agatha’s leggings, a pause in the way her hands fumble for a moment. </p><p> </p><p>“Are we talking about this?” Rio asks around her own sharp breathing, unsure, willing to press pause if it meant finding clarity.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t filter the raw determination out of her features, a solid indication that she was ready to hit play. She doesn’t find the words, doesn’t nullify the moment. </p><p> </p><p>“Are we just-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio is cut off by action, Agatha stripping herself of her own pants, lifting her hips enough to bring them to her knees in one motion, Rio scrambles in to meet the desperation, helps them off the rest of the way. </p><p> </p><p>“I want you to touch me,” Agatha husks out, into Rio’s neck as they crash back together. She can feel the sharp inhale, the full admission of consent making Rio short circuit. </p><p> </p><p>Her fingers dance over her hips, scratch at the fabric of her underwear, she settles close, one leg hooked over Agatha’s knee. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s on her back, legs open as Rio’s hand settles over her core like it’s always belonged there.</p><p> </p><p>The cold of the room pricks at her inner thighs as gentle fingers trace over soft skin, cascading from under her belly button to caress over her underwear. </p><p> </p><p>Her own hand comes up to mark its rightful spot around Rio’s neck,  squeezing just enough to feel Rio react to it, bring her closer, their eyes locked as Rio’s hand finally breaks the last barrier.</p><p> </p><p>It feels like a synced gasp, initial contact, one finger pressed into wetness. Agatha had felt it growing, the cold edge of the puddle forming in her underwear, but Rio’s fingers made it feel more tangible, suddenly eagerly aware of just how wet she was, just how easy she was for Rio. There’s a sharp tingle of overwhelm as fingers start to move, a slow caress of sliding in the soft sensitivity. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes show patience, a rhythm that barely takes shape around the overwhelming newness, the steep riverbed of connection, she angles up slightly, letting Agatha adjust. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whimpers at every touch directly to her clit, a destination that feels far away yet so close, a spark of delicious pain in drawing closer. </p><p> </p><p>After a few moments the swell of it shifts, an intensity that morphs into a need for more, and Rio seems to sense it, making her movements more firm, building a slow pace as she rubs against the wetness with two fingers, melting further in as she rests their foreheads together. </p><p> </p><p>“baby,” Agatha moans, a sharp gasp around it, a tether breaking. </p><p> </p><p>It sings like an unburdened choir, a new feeling that begins to take shape, something thirsty and immense. </p><p> </p><p>In the end, Agatha removes her hand from Rio’s neck, grabs at her working hand to make her stop. </p><p> </p><p>“I can’t,” she heaves, breathing harshly, holding firm onto Rio’s wrist, but not removing her hand entirely, the scorching overwhelm never allowing her to crash over the edge.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps it was the freshness of the sensation, no chance to get used to it. But Agatha knew that there was still a column of fear, something holding her back from giving up full control. </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t offer judgement, she nods barely, something specific in the solid drop of heavy eyelids, offering a moment to breathe. She presses a soft kiss to Agatha’s lips, a peck to her forehead, before removing her hand from Agatha’s underwear fully. </p><p> </p><p>The creep of  unease presses in from the wake of a task left incomplete, a shadow looming over what she couldn’t allow. Agatha couldn’t let the curtain close like this, needed to find a new course to take.</p><p> </p><p>She pushes up slightly, moves Rio back with her own proximity, her hand on Rio’s hip without hesitation, a refocus on the tactile lurch of polyester shorts, the light in Rio’s eyes shining differently, a gentle shift towards a want for something else.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs her knee, angles Rio backwards, settles over her like a safe awning offering shade, her hair cascades over her shoulder, Rio’s hand coming up to brush some of it back, swinging the weight of it over the other shoulder and out of the way.</p><p> </p><p>Rio cards her fingers through it, a whispered caress that has the heat in Agatha’s stomach re-blooming, seeking connection as Agatha’s eyes trace over eager skin. She presses a kiss to Rio’s sternum.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha thinks to take another moment to prepare, rear back, take off Rio’s shorts, but she doesn’t, sinks her hand through both layers. And she likes it, the way the waistband, the cotton of Rio’s panties press into the back of her hand, guiding her in as she grazes her intended destination. </p><p> </p><p>Rio closes her eyes almost immediately, bites her own lip. Agatha steadies herself in the soft heat, anchors her forehead against Rio’s, feels her intense exhale against her lips. </p><p> </p><p>And here, she finds the power. </p><p> </p><p>The soft groan that escapes Rio’s mouth, the way her hips seem to lock up in anticipation. She tries to repeat the same echo of a pattern Rio played against her a few minutes ago, tries to focus on the wet click of her fingers pressing over and over, her own breathing growing harsher as she parallels the intensity of Rio’s heaving chest. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whines, a cry of desperation, a plea of gratitude and need.</p><p> </p><p>The world on her finger tips, molded to pure pleasure, she doesn’t ever want to stop, already consumed with Rio’s moans, the pleasant weight of their bodies flush together, the power in such little movement of her fingertips. </p><p> </p><p>Rio holds onto the back of her hand, guiding her fingers away from her clit just as Agatha started to grow more confident, certain that she was building her closer. Instead, Rio readjusts her hips, presses Agatha’s fingers lower, presses in.</p><p> </p><p>”Please,” Rio whines, her eyes opening slightly, a raw expression reflected in blackened irises, desperate and pleading. Agatha pushes one finger in without much thought about how to perform this part, hesitant in the moment.</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes the pause to hump forward into Agatha’s hand herself, not waiting for her to start her own movement, taking in Agatha’s finger fully. </p><p> </p><p>“This okay?” Rio asks, breathless, checking in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, too turned on to form words, locked into the sheen of sweat on Rio’s neck, the pressure around her middle finger, the steady lurch of Rio’s hips. She kisses Rio’s worry away before easing back, pushing inside her once more with two fingers.</p><p> </p><p>A new whine cascades against Agatha’s lips, another dose of strength that she swallows down, each sound feeling like a prize to be savored. She sets her own pace this time, slow and measured, playing Rio like a violin, drawing out harmonic reactions. </p><p> </p><p>Rio guides her hand one more time, pressing the angle of her fingers a bit higher, placing Agatha’s thumb over her clit. The crash seems inevitable as Rio’s leg starts to shake with each tender thrust, the hold on Agatha’s hair coming back harsher now, holding on, bracing for impact.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha can hardly process it, that she, her hand, is making Rio lose herself, that Rio trusts her to touch her, to hear each unguilty plea, wrecked sob, to give up control, put it in Agatha’s hands. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe it’s a tightening around her fingers, the elevation of her pitch, the clench of fingers on the back of her head, but Agatha knows it's coming. She’s caught between wanting to make Rio cum and wanting to keep touching her like this forever. </p><p> </p><p>It shutters over them like a camera flash, an unforgettable blip, a wicked gasp, the twitch of her thigh, a new wave of warm heat on her fingers, Rio’s hand harsh around her wrist. </p><p> </p><p>Pulling out feels like a freedom she doesn’t want, content to stay knuckle deep for eternity. Agatha isn’t ready for Rio’s eyes to open when they do, to find her staring back like she is awed by her magic, blessed by the chance to be on the other side of her power. </p><p> </p><p>She kisses Agatha like she is art, a tragic mosaic of beauty and meaningful paint strokes, the colors meticulous and glowing. She holds her like she is holy, a brazen piece of the truth held up to the light. </p><p> </p><p>The moments after only feel like a safe beacon of clarity, no regret written in the lines of her face, just something open and simple. It feels like a point of no return, but a chapter she would never want to erase, a point she never wanted to forget. </p><p> </p><p>Rio strokes her cheek as they both settle into the pillows catching their breath.  </p><p> </p><p>”Can I try something?” Rio asks softly against her neck, but it sounds like ‘do you trust me?’ to Agatha’s ears. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha almost wishes it was midnight instead of 12 in the afternoon, wishes the light didn’t give her the chance to see the adoration in Rio’s eyes, the quiet determination to take this only where Agatha would allow. It’s jarring, the realization of how they’d gotten here. Agatha naked except for her soaked panties, Rio only in the gray shorts clinging to her thighs. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha can’t imagine telling her ‘no’ ever again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stares at her for another moment, gives her a second to rethink, but Agatha doesn’t take back her permission, levels Rio with the same look of trust. </p><p> </p><p>She moves up without another word, makes sure Agatha is settled against the pillows once more before pulling at her hips again, this time removing her panties fully, a slow trail of certainty, Agatha forces herself to swallow, scared she might start drooling. </p><p> </p><p>Touching Rio had only made it worse, the stickiness coating her inner thighs with the movement. Her head sinks lower, but brown eyes stay locked on blue ones, slow in her descent. </p><p> </p><p>Rio eases her face between Agatha’s thighs, wraps her arms around them, presses her mouth over her upper thigh biting down on the pale flesh. She skims her nose over soft hair, sears kisses over her that never edge over the surface of pleasure, instead they ground her back, reminding her to be present. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio’s tongue touches her for the first time, there’s a startling frame of languid sin. It makes her feel guilty, not in the context of religion, but because of how good it feels, the delicate stroke of Rio’s long tongue, flat and gentle, only adding to the mess.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can feel the involuntary contraction, the sudden gasp of her own breath, a shock of pleasure she finds herself chasing, she chokes down a moan as Rio continues slowly working over her clit again and again.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand grips at the sheets, a wave of need crashing over her, a place to hold onto, let loose all the unchecked power in her grasp, the other hand clenched against her own mouth, biting down on the back of it, her teeth clenching over the rippling tendons there, an attempt at quieting the rampage of breaths, the choir of holy sounds. </p><p> </p><p>It’s the same mistake again, the path of pleasure that she holds control over, the swell of need that she pushes down. </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t notice at first, consumed by the meal laid out before her, squeezing Agatha’s thighs as the heat of her mouth finds a home. Brown eyes turn up without moving away, a chime like a church bell, sudden but hard to miss. </p><p> </p><p>Her grasp loosens from opened thighs as she pulls away slightly, a layer of Agatha’s arousal clear across the lower half of her face, the shine of her lips an echo of the light reflected in her eyes, she doesn’t seem stunned, a calm that ebbs out through her fingers. </p><p> </p><p>She reaches for Agatha’s wrist, pulls her hand away from her mouth, pulls it down to rest against the side of her head, leans into Agatha’s palm, encouraging the contact. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes the bait, figures out her part with no more prompting, gathering as much of Rio’s hair as possible, holding it out of her face, grasping firmly enough to guide her face. </p><p> </p><p>Rio frees the sheets from Agatha’s grip next, threads their fingers together, settles further down again, the pierce of brown eyes holding sharply as her tongue settles over her again. </p><p> </p><p>The guilt dissolves as she scratches against Rio’s scalp, her soft moan reverberating against her clit, the tilt of Rio’s head shifted with intent. She squeezes Rio’s hand, allows the course of pressure to build in her core, relaxing into the natural desire to buck her hips. </p><p> </p><p>Rio keeps her down, the flick of her tongue causing a delicious moan to fly into the air, Agatha no longer swallowing it down. </p><p> </p><p>It plays out in whimpers and heightened gasps, short moans that spur her further.</p><p> </p><p>”Rio, please.” She isn’t sure what she’s begging for, the solid plea falling out as she presses her hand more harshly into her head, needing the salvation to continue.</p><p> </p><p>For a fleeting moment, she tries to slide back, away from the overwhelming heat, too much to process, her brain unable to file this away as anything that makes sense. But Rio’s mouth follows the movement, angling her mouth to lock Agatha in. </p><p> </p><p>“Almost there,” She swears she hears- feels the words slip out of Rio’s mouth into her core.</p><p> </p><p>She waits for it, bears down and pleads for release, a strung wire that needs to be cut, she squeezes her eyes shut, a keen focus on the thundering need between her legs, the wet flick of Rio’s mouth, the shuddering trill of her own sounds, her chest rising and falling, the softness of Rio’s hair, the sweat between them, the way Rio let’s her squeeze her fingers tight enough to hurt. </p><p> </p><p>The rubber band snaps, a curling groan slings out with it, Rio’s tongue not ceasing but slowing, a kick of moving forward, feeling it for all it’s worth, a burning white bliss, something pure and beautiful. </p><p> </p><p>She feels boneless, loosening her grip on Rio’s head and fingers, but unable to pull away fully, still using them to anchor her as she tries to catch her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaves kisses on her thigh, rests her head on Agatha’s hip, her face angled enough to look up at her, watching as Agatha finds the ground again.</p><p> </p><p>Blue eyes open slightly, a grounding breath as she searches for brown eyes and a soft knowing smile. No worry in either of their faces. She scratches over her head, pushing back the few strands of hair that had broken free. Rio strokes her hand with her thumb.</p><p> </p><p>A calm.</p><p> </p><p>For once Agatha isn’t afraid of the storm to come.</p><p> </p>

<p>Nehemiah 8:10- Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength </p><p> </p><p>Another day dawns on the attempt of undoing a lifetime of curses, a patented version of the life Agatha was slowly getting used to living. Waking up in the soft cocoon of blankets, the warmth of beginning summer creeping up through the sheets. Or maybe that was Rio, her limbs slung around her, her hands always pressing into her. It held to her throat like a dagger, a reminder of the cool edge of the weapon, another reason to cling to the overbearing warmth of tangled legs and Rio’s head resting on her chest. </p><p> </p><p>“Are they gone yet?” Agatha murmurs without opening her eyes, her hand squeezing the jut of Rio’s hip bone still under the blanket. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand threads out of Agatha’s hair, careful not to pull at the web of tangles, reaching blindly for her phone under the pillow without breaking their embrace. </p><p> </p><p>“Pulling out the driveway right now.” Rio voices,her mouth still half-pressed into Agatha’s chest, the smirk evident in her voice, watching the video from the front door camera as her phone thuds against the mattress. </p><p> </p><p>There isn’t much time to process the movement that follows, Rio jolting up and over her, kissing as many spots of Agatha’s face that she can reach, the joyous cackle that leaves Rio’s lips as she collapses over her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart clenches, partly with the instinct to cringe at such an open display of affection, but her brain is quickly slotted back into reality, that the joy is aimed at her, that it changes everything. </p><p> </p><p>Still, she pushes Rio off of her, levels her with a scowl.</p><p> </p><p>”Don’t be grumpy,” Rio directs, her hand lazily tracing over the side of Agatha’s jaw, the sleep in her eyes still weighted, she angles forward, whispers “we’re alone” against Agatha’s lips like a necessary reminder. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs onto the front of Rio’s oversized Tshirt, keeps her close, doesn’t let her break the kiss. Instead, she uses the freedom of Rio’s words, takes the opportunity to pick up the pace, recenter the heated passion having full confidence that neither of Rio’s parents would be barging in to disturb them. </p><p> </p><p>She still isn’t used to the blazing coil of lightning that strikes her insides, the way it pulls on her heart and her core in the same instance, a harsh ripple that feels like collapsing inwards.</p><p> </p><p>She isn’t used to the way Rio melts into her, allows her the power of molding them together, her hands a boundless testament to the places she’d steer them. </p><p> </p><p>Rio pushes Agatha’s thighs apart, biting her lip into her mouth, a sting of pleasure as her tongue comes over it a moment later, her hands scratching Agatha’s inner thigh, rubbing into the apex of flesh.</p><p> </p><p>“I know how to make you less grumpy,” Rio mumbles against her, smirking over Agatha’s mouth as her hand trails higher to break the seal of the borrowed pair of boxers keeping Rio from Agatha’s center. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t ready for her own insatiable hunger, the ache in her stomach growing solid against the world they’d opened up only a few days ago, it feels like an echo of boundless desire, a feeling that Rio seems to match so far, a want that Rio had yet to make her feel guilty for. </p><p> </p><p>It shouldn’t be surprising either, that the feeling isn’t only in the realm of receiving, but she wants to touch Rio just as badly if not more. The sugar coated dream of bringing her over the edge, watching as the brown of her eyes glaze over, elicit the delicate whimpers. </p><p> </p><p>It’s this carnal desire that spurs the movement of her own hand, Agatha dragging her fingers over Rio’s stomach, scratching just above the seam of her underwear, reangling her legs to make room for Rio to open her thighs, an easier angle for both of their hands. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha presses in her own hand, parallels the soft exploration of Rio’s fingers stroking against her, it sings of something precious as their mouths stay in a battle, a course of kisses that never lose their passion, two warriors training alongside each other.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs into her mouth, a shift of surprise as contact is made, as if she was too focused on pleasing Agatha to fully process that she was actively trying to return the favor. </p><p> </p><p>It’s hard to concentrate on both, the soft peak of Rio’s clit, the ragged breaths against her mouth, the slow descent of Rio’s fingers until two are firmly inside her, her own shallow breathing. It’s hard to keep pace, to flesh out a thoughtful pattern when her own moans shake her off her intention. </p><p> </p><p>Her brain feels foggy, a balancing act of placing pieces of focus in different directions, Rio grabbing onto her thigh with her free hand, her nails digging in, she finds her own hand sliding up, pulling on one of Rio’s nipples, maybe in an effort to gain the upper hand, the immediate reaction is Rio biting down on her lip, a wrecked moan sighed into her mouth. Agatha can’t help the grin that presses back against Rio’s lips, the piercing knowledge that she’d won. </p><p> </p><p>She’s only had sips of communion wine, but Agatha is sure this is what being drunk feels like, dizzy and thrilling even if she’s safely pressed against her person, held between blankets as the sun glows through the window. </p><p> </p><p>There isn’t fear here, just the open plain of pleasure, a shared moment of peace, a chase towards release, equal effort, the same roaring want. Agatha can feel tears on her face, but they aren’t her own, blue eyes snapping open to find brown.</p><p> </p><p>”Agatha,” Rio begs, her fingers moving faster inside her, her thumb grazing her clit as Agatha presses two fingers over her, rubbing sharp circles over Rio’s, “please.”</p><p> </p><p>It isn’t sadness, no jumbled mess of unspoken hurt. It’s a desperate readiness, giving her power over to Agatha, the aching need to cum. Agatha can feel the fresh gush of wetness, trailing down towards Rio’s entrance and back up, rides the wave of it to find a more heated pace, placing all her focus here, finding her own breath, to renew the kiss, sweeter, slower. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s groans slip out against the chorus of her own, her hips slamming forward to meet the ends of Rio’s fingers, a paralleled ripple of her own pace.  </p><p> </p><p>Everything tightens, a firm shift as muscles coil and fingers don’t stop, a determined slide that adds pressure in place of tenderness. </p><p> </p><p>Rio cums on Agatha’s hand, her muscles spasming slightly, her head knocking into Agatha’s collarbone, a thud of bone on bone as Rio catches her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha remembers Rio’s fingers then, still buried inside her, the twitch of her own hips involuntary. And Rio seems to remember them too, starting to pull out slowly, a hitch in Agatha’s breath, as she presses back in, the fullness renewed as her walls clench around her knuckles, Agatha has to find her own air again, grasping at the back of Rio’s neck as she presses kisses over her shoulder, a static of warmth and patience, a willingness to find the strength to keep going. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha focuses back on the feeling, the pressure building, her nails scratching over Rio’s back, she lets herself moan, doesn’t hold it in, the jarring truth of her own safety pushes her over the edge, the glaring heat of feeling taken care of. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Wisdom 5:1- Then shall the righteous one with great assurance confront his oppressors who set at nought his labors.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifts in Rio’s bed, swallowing, still catching her breath. The air feels cooler, Rio gone from her side. Blue eyes trace the ceiling, fingers playing with the frayed edge of a pillow case. </p><p> </p><p>She hears Rio’s feet on the stairs, a race to get back to her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio throws herself back in bed, the content of her arms rattling with the movement, their knees knock as Rio settles closer.</p><p> </p><p>”Here,” she presses her hand toward Agatha to take, dropping two Oreos into her palm as two water bottles tumble onto the covers, thankfully still sealed. </p><p> </p><p>“Cookies for breakfast?” Agatha raises an eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>”That’s just the appetizer,” Rio winks, kissing the side of Agatha’s face, before bending forward to bite one of the cookies out of Agatha’s hand, leaving some of her saliva behind.</p><p> </p><p>The cool drip of spit makes Agatha scowl, somehow completely different from the activities and bodily fluid they were just taking part in.</p><p> </p><p>”Did you even wash your hands?” Agatha tries again, eyeing her own Oreo skepticly.</p><p> </p><p>”Shut up” Rio is smirking, twisting the cap off a water before handing it to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>She sinks into the bed, back against the head board, posture hunched as she grabs her phone. Agatha doesn’t mean to watch, to track every movement but it feels like a trance, a beautiful curse, her eyes destined to rake over the curve of Rio’s jawline, the jut of her knuckles, the soft lines of her neck. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyebrows wrinkle, something on her phone catching her eye.</p><p> </p><p>”What?” Agatha asks, dropping next to her, her head smacking over Rio’s shoulder as she settles half on top of her, angled to stare at Rio’s screen.</p><p> </p><p>”Alice said to check my student email.”</p><p> </p><p>So she does. </p><p> </p><p>Opens her Gmail app, switches from personal to her student account, waits the 2 seconds it takes to load. A new email from St. Elizabeth’s High School. </p><p> </p><p>Rio clicks it unceremoniously, unsure of what could be waiting to be read, Agatha watches on, half interested in the screen, but mostly here as an excuse to stay so close. </p><p> </p><p>‘Dear St. Elizabeth’s students, faculty, and families, </p><p> </p><p>This email serves as a notification that Principal Harkness has been placed on administrative leave. In situations like this, speculation often occurs, but please understand that personnel matters are confidential and we are unable to share additional information at this time. Please note that the wellbeing of our students is still the school’s number one priority. During this process, Vice Principal Valentina Allegra De Fontaine will assume the role of acting Principal. </p><p> </p><p>Thank you and God bless, </p><p>Superintendent Johnson’</p><p> </p><p>”Dude,” tumbles out of Rio’s mouth, still processing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scrambles up, sitting like a spring waiting to pop, needing to look Rio in the eye. </p><p> </p><p>“What..” but the question never finds the air, a spiral of thoughts threading over each other, fear and anger slipping into a cracked disbelief, a startled gasp of relief. </p><p> </p><p>It isn’t clarity, no real answer, just a step towards something that feels like true freedom, a punishment looming to match the crime. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey” Rio is stroking her face, blue on brown like it’s the only way to be, it breaks her loose from the ebb of panic, the overwhelming sense of floating on her own for the first time. “We’re okay.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kisses her, a surge of intoxicated inhale like her brain remembers it needs oxygen at the same time it knows she needs Rio’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Going back to school isn’t exactly a breeze. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha has half a mind to beg Rio’s parents to let them keep staying home (stupid email automation, sending it to every parent in the district), but she knows it isn’t something she can argue.</p><p> </p><p>But the routine feels broken, something new about getting ready in a house of 4 now, it doesn’t feel like vacation anymore, it feels real. Brushing her teeth next to Rio, pouring Mr. Vidal a glass of orange juice, taking a bowl of Frosted Flakes from Rio’s mother. It's easy, yet strange, not used to feeling like a necessary cog, still sulking inwardly over the harsh shadows she’s managed to escape.</p><p> </p><p>She tries her best to breathe through the nightmares, listens starkly to sweet nothings Rio presses into her ear, she tries to forget the tea, and the slap across Rio’s face, the bloody nose. But the jolt of it is still clear in her mind.</p><p> </p><p>It’s hard. Realizing how good she has it now only makes the contrast shine worse. Agatha tries to be grateful, clings to the warmth of Rio’s hand on her thigh as she drives them to school. The tranquility of the warm weather, the playlists Rio never fails to make too loud during their 10 minute commute.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio, to Agatha’s annoyance, notices the slight shift, the walls that threaten to shoot back up. She doesn’t blame her for the quiet retraction, the prickling stretch towards self preservation. She presses soft kisses into Agatha’s cheeks, a flutter of a blush still coating Agatha’s face. “I’m here.” Rio whispers to her, let’s Agatha cling to her in the third floor bathroom before class, doesn’t poke and prod at the way she’s abnormally quiet, softly resigned. </p><p> </p><p>The first week back could have been worse. Classmates staring at her, a hallway that splits like the ocean to avoid contact. She knows they read the email too, knows they’re aware of who her mother is, but it still burns, feeling like a pariah instead of a victim. And she knows too, that none of them have the details, that Evanora’s dirt is still tightly sealed away. For the first time, Agatha wants the world to know. The truth is somehow easier than any rumors. </p><p> </p><p>Jen looks at her like she’s a broken shard of glass, scared to touch. Still, she sits close to her in the library, stays close by especially when Rio isn’t around, a buffer, a layer of protection. She tries at talking, but doesn’t ask questions, just stares daggers back at any girls that get too close. </p><p> </p><p>Alice makes copies of the notes she missed, fills the silence with updates about assignments. She shares her peanut m&amp;m’s in study hall and doesn’t seem thrown off when Agatha accepts them without a bratty remark for once. </p><p> </p><p>Rio is astute in her protection, always lingering, always connected somehow. It’s still shocking that it never grows overbearing.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you two dating?” Jen asks and Alice punches her in the shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>”Sorry,” Alice tries, “I told her not to ask.”</p><p> </p><p>They’re sitting on the turf of the football field after school, books spread out around them, studying for their History final.</p><p> </p><p>They’d gotten treats from the Ice Cream truck that passes by their school and perhaps Agatha was staring too hard at the way Rio’s tongue darted out to lick her SpongeBob popsicle. </p><p> </p><p>Rio pauses, licks her lips. Agatha can’t even be mad, caught by the thought of Rio’s sticky sweet cold mouth on her. When Rio looks at her, she knows she’s waiting, giving Agatha the freedom to confirm or deny. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha shrugs, biting her spoon to hide the smile that perks up her own face. </p><p> </p><p>And for once, she feels like a teenager, a joyous child confirming a crush.</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” Jen chirps, “I thought Rio was gonna die from yearning.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio throws her pen at Jen who easily swats it, but looks flabbergasted all the same. </p><p> </p><p>Alice chuckles as Jen sputters. And Agatha can’t help but laugh too.</p><p> </p><p>”My yearning is none of your business.” Rio admonishes, turning back to her textbook. But Agatha can see the hint of amusement playing under the heat. </p><p> </p><p>“You both were like sad Shakespeare characters, pretending to be star crossed lovers.” Alice jokes.</p><p> </p><p>”Was it that obvious?” Agatha asks, actually curious, she thought she was good at hiding it. </p><p> </p><p>Jen scoffs, exasperated, “Something gay was definitely in the air.”</p><p> </p><p>”To act on your sad lesbian crush on your best friend, or not to act on your-,” Alice tries to joke again, the Shakespeare theme coming back, but Jen slaps a hand over her mouth to silence the chance of a full monologue.</p><p> </p><p>”Study time. Remember?” Rio voices, a chuckle surfacing behind the attempt at refocusing. </p><p> </p><p>Alice and Jen snap back toward their own books, even if Jen rolls her eyes first. Agatha reaches over, strokes over Rio’s knee, a calm press of fingers, a request for connection. </p><p> </p><p>Rio resettles, shifts closer to push into Agatha’s side.</p><p> </p><p>The ease of it bleeds over into the harsh tingles of healing wounds, Rio close enough to hold, Alice and Jen being okay with it. The sun over head, a chance at love seeing the light. </p><p> </p><p>Sister Calderu. Lilia. Agatha sees her in the hall, she tries not to linger like a lost animal, but the older woman looks at her with a knowing gaze, something sharp and sad. Lilia gestures for her to follow, Rio squeezes her hand before letting go, letting her find her own solace.</p><p> </p><p>Students aren’t usually allowed in the teacher’s lounge, but it’s before class. The space is pretty empty. A table with metal folding chairs. A fridge, a microwave, a coffee maker. No other nuns. </p><p> </p><p>Lilia motions for her to sit. Fills a styrofoam cup with black coffee from the pot, takes the chair across from her. </p><p> </p><p>“That girl, Rio? Is that her name?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods.</p><p> </p><p>”She seems sweet.” Lilia smiles bright, supportive.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles back, a reflection of the truth of Lilia’s assumption.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t know how to fill in the silence, whether to reveal it all to her, knowing that Lilia was still a nun, could easily find the space to hate her, renounce her homosexual sins,</p><p> </p><p>”I wanted to give you some clarity,” Lilia changes the subject for her, reaching over to settle her hands over Agatha’s like she’s getting ready to read the future from her palms. “About your mother.”</p><p> </p><p>And then it clicks. Lilia knows something. More than what that email said. That sad look from earlier, Agatha needed to know what it meant.</p><p> </p><p>”CPS is conducting an investigation, the school is keeping her on leave until it concludes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha breaks the eye contact, unable to push down all the emotion of it, a more concrete understanding of how this was working, perhaps Mrs. Vidal calling CPS was actually getting them somewhere. But now it was clear, Lilia knew that any suspicions of abuse from 10 years ago held some weight. </p><p> </p><p>”She asked me to keep an eye on you.” Lilia admits, a shuttering sigh, “to report back.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha removes her hands from the table, breaks the reassurance of contact, unsure how much she can trust now.</p><p> </p><p>”Agatha, honey.” The broken chirp of Lilia’s voice, shame, a shaky attempt at holding up her guilt.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha looks up, willing herself to hear her out. </p><p> </p><p>“I should have pushed harder to stay in your life. I should have done something 10 years ago. I’m sorry.” Lilia’s eyes fall closed, trying her best to not crumble. “My loyalty is to you, honey.”</p><p> </p><p>“You didn’t know,” Agatha trembles at the sound of her own voice, finding the strength to reconnect their hands, a promise in saying “It wasn’t your fault.” as tears slide out without warning.</p><p> </p><p>And this too feels powerful, giving Lilia the space to forgive herself. Fighting the pressure of wishing things were different, wondering out loud the paths life would have taken. She knows she can’t dream up something different, this is reality.</p><p> </p><p>The one she’s chosen to stick with. The one where forgiveness will be her salvation, where growth will open her up to her power, the one where Rio exists, kisses her like she’s made of only good things. The scales resteady themselves under new weight, a pressure that swings over towards the light, she’s actually reaching towards it this time. </p><p> </p><p>Two weeks back starts to lull Agatha into a calm. The stares don’t exactly stop altogether but they feel less intense, the students getting no answers and moving on to the newest piece of gossip. </p><p> </p><p>With each day of no news concerning the investigation of her mother, no one from CPS reaching out to her, the timer was ticking on her ability to hold it altogether. A few more weeks of school. A few months til 18. Agatha tried to remember that the overwhelm of it wouldn’t last forever.</p><p> </p><p>She was trying not to be pessimistic, breathe through all the moments that tested her patience, live for the moments of her and Rio tucked under sheets, for family dinners with her parents, for running faster than Jen in gym class. </p><p> </p><p>But the sting of annoyance would swirl back every so often.</p><p> </p><p>And English of course was still her least favorite class.</p><p> </p><p>”I don’t understand why we have to read this book.” Rio comments from her seat, intended only for Agatha’s ears.</p><p> </p><p>”Ms. Vidal?” Sister Hart hears anyway, an old lady with the ears of an owl. “Something to share with the class?”</p><p> </p><p>“I actually agree with Rio,” Wanda chimes in unwarranted, clearly over what had happened between them, holding up her copy of The Merchant of Venice. “Parts of the book question God and make a mockery of Christianity.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been trying to avoid Wanda. For a lot of reasons, but mostly because every word out of her mouth annoyed the fuck out of her, even the ones that weren’t directly quoted from scripture.</p><p> </p><p>”Where’d you read that?” Another student pipes up, now forgoing the integrity of the classroom, no one raising their hands to speak.</p><p> </p><p>“I meant the antisemitism,” Rio tries, “Shylock being forced to convert to Christianity.”</p><p> </p><p>”The bible says-“</p><p> </p><p>A collective sigh takes over the classroom as Wanda begins another speech.</p><p> </p><p>”Ms. Maximoff. While we appreciate your passion, we're studying Shakespeare right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay well, let’s quote Shakespeare then,” Wanda starts another attempt at making her point, determined and stern in her resignation, unable to back down, “In the book, Antonio says ‘A soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek’. He’s calling Christians villainous.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t want to get involved. She shouldn’t get involved.</p><p> </p><p>”An evil soul.” Agatha corrects out loud. “Its ‘an evil soul.” Heads turn to look at her, wondering when she developed the ability to participate in class again.</p><p> </p><p>”Okay, and? What’s that supposed to mean?” Wanda asks.</p><p> </p><p>”You remember when Satan quotes scripture to tempt Jesus.” Rio tries, saving some sliver of sanity. </p><p> </p><p>“Matthew 4:6. So what?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries to hold back the chuckle, but Wanda has made it all too easy.</p><p> </p><p>”Even the devil can recite scripture, sweetheart.”</p><p> </p><p>She expects the collective gasp, the way the room charges into ‘ooo’s and ‘ahh’s, the smirk on Rio’s face. But Wanda’s red face is sort of a surprise, as is the tilted anger that springs over Sister Hart’s face. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda grabs her things without a word, wiping her tears on the sleeve of her uniform before storming out of the classroom. </p><p> </p><p>“Ms. Harkness. Principal’s office now.”</p><p> </p><p>The punishment feels earned, worth it for all the shit stirring Wanda has done. God forbid Agatha use Wanda’s power against her. </p><p> </p><p>The coarse shine of praise only swells as she finds Rio smiling at her as she gathers her own things to leave.</p><p> </p><p>”Welcome back, baby”</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Ezekiel 18:31- Cast away from you all the crimes you have committed, and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s backyard has always reminded her of Summer. The grass kept short, the concrete warm. Agatha remembers the pain of Invisalign the July before 10th grade, the ice cream they’d eat on the back deck as it melted in the sun. She remembers family barbecues, Rio’s grandfather telling her silly jokes, not being afraid to ask for another hot dog. </p><p> </p><p>She can see the memory so clearly, a few months ago, throwing cheese balls at Rio, learning they were going to the same college. She can still feel the heat of her own anger.</p><p> </p><p>And it’s actually hot now, the sun sitting high above them, the brightness blinding and warping. Her blue eyes have always been sensitive, but sleep still sticks to her eyelids too. In the calloused press of heat, Agatha is cold. Shaking, shivering. A stale panic that she’s used to hiding. She swallows, watches as Rio’s mother pours her a glass of water before walking back into the house. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha picks at the thread of Rio’s T shirt, the one she’s currently wearing, and wills herself to truly believe this isn’t an interrogation. </p><p> </p><p>“My name is Yelena Belova” The woman sat across from her starts reading from a card, “I am a CPS case worker and I am here to…Blah. Blah. Blah.” A sigh leaving her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t move, waits for the woman to make her next attempt.</p><p> </p><p>”They try to make us read this stupid script, very impersonal in my opinion, but I don’t get paid enough to follow the rules.” The accented words find Agatha’s ears, but she can’t bring herself to react, needing this to move along for this lady to get to her questions. </p><p> </p><p>“Anyway,” she continues undeterred by Agatha’s silence, “I’m Yelena, you’re Agatha. Good. Great start.”</p><p> </p><p>”How long have you been doing this?” Agatha finally speaks, her anxiety pushed over into a new deflection, overwhelmed with the need to question authority.</p><p> </p><p>”Hmmm,” Yelena pauses to think, “Three-four years.”</p><p> </p><p>”You seem young.” Agatha tries for a reaction.</p><p> </p><p>Yelena moves to grab a handful of something out of her bag, dropping candy on the table in the space between them.</p><p> </p><p>”You’re trying to bribe me with Starbursts?”</p><p> </p><p>”Yeah,” Yelena shrugs unwrapping one for herself, “Usually works on the little ones.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes one against her better judgement, a power play that she knows she’s losing, she hopes the sugar will soothe her long enough to catch her breath, push away the parts of her brain that ache to shut down.</p><p> </p><p>’Where are you from?” Agatha asks.</p><p> </p><p>Yelena levels her with a look of resignation, like she was not new to these games of deflection, but wasn’t entirely disturbed by Agatha playing hard to get.</p><p> </p><p>”We can go back to the script if you want me to.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>”Do you want to tell me about your mother?”</p><p> </p><p>The question is enough to shake her back towards the intentions of the conversation, an attempt at following through. The answer bounces around her head like a rubber ball, gaining speed with each bump but never coming out. Because this had gone farther than she even hoped, Evanora being held accountable had never come up in her wildest dreams. And here. Here was the chance for remedy, for vindication. The part of her that wanted to protect her mother was gone. Now she only wanted to tell the truth. Agatha forces a barely there nod, grabs her glass of water and takes two gulps, scared she’d choke on the candy melting in her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>Yelena pulls out some forms, words that blur together under Agatha’s rattling gaze. A pen that clicks like a gavel banging. A beginning, an ending. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m gonna ask questions, for now I just need you to say Yes or No.”</p><p> </p><p>They work through the forms, a sharp lilt of Agatha’s voice, a void of her own identity, replaced by something taut and broken, the sound of yes or no not sounding like her own voice. </p><p> </p><p>It doesn’t feel as daunting as recounting every slap or detailing the color of every bruise. But it feels like waking up, realizing that there was a place to put this burden that wasn’t just the inside of her own mind. And Yelena listened and marked the form, no pressure of judgement or pity. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels the cool trail of tears on her face, the breaths she tries to mask as even. Yelena offers tissues before starting on a new form. </p><p> </p><p>It pushes on like a blur, the sun moving in the sky, the brightness tangling through tree branches and water towers. </p><p> </p><p>They move to harder questions, finding a degree of clarity in marks left behind, of anger and the avenues it took. They trace over the swell of the hurt, barely touching but knowing it is there together, framing it but never placing full pressure. It feels almost clinical, all the actual words to speak of the abuse, a way to put it all in easy boxes, organize the memory of the mess, </p><p> </p><p>“Do you feel safe now?” Yelena asks, it’s not a question on the form, something solid in the curiosity of green eyes, a stoic strength in the light there, a light that Agatha recognized, like Yelena had truly understood.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha breathes a sigh of relief at the recognition, the first exhale on stable ground. </p><p> </p><p>She thinks of the home resting beside them, the pillow she gets to rest her head on, the girl she gets to hold. The warmth of the day finally settles over her, the heat pressing away the static tilt of goose bumps and shivers. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha offers, feeling the strength return to her voice, “I do.”</p><p> </p><p>Yelena doesn’t move for a moment, allows the words an extra second to wash over her, really feel it. She nods before gathering all the paper work into a neat stack, placing it back in the folder and into her bag. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hears the sliding glass door open again, looks up to find Rio bounding towards her. Her eyes filled with concern, but still love. Rio gives her a small smile, reassuring and unsure, trying to meet Agatha wherever she may be. </p><p> </p><p>Her body instantly relaxes, relief in the way she’d made it through the last few hours, a comfort in always coming back to Rio. Even if Rio’s mother had banished her from the backyard so that Agatha could talk to Yelena alone. </p><p> </p><p>Rio caresses the side of her head, holds Agatha’s cheek to her chest, tilts down awkwardly to place a kiss on her head, uncaring of the way Yelena might be looking at them. Agatha’s arms surge up reflexively, holding tightly against Rio’s hip.</p><p> </p><p>Yelena leaves her business card, says she’ll be in touch. Leaves through the gate with a soft smile.</p><p> </p><p>”How’d it go?” Rio mumbles into her hair, unwilling to break the contact.</p><p> </p><p>”Good.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls back just enough to find Rio’s eyes, tilts up to kiss her. </p><p> </p><p>And there. </p><p> </p><p>There’s the heat. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Micah 1:4- The mountains melt under him and the valleys split open, like wax before the fire, like water poured down a slope. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can feel her own heart beat, a thrumming pulse against her spine, a disjointed pressure that betrays the pattern of her breathing. </p><p> </p><p>She no longer feels the pressure to look away, Rio’s bottom lip caught between her own teeth. A focus in brown eyes that never leave Agatha’s. </p><p> </p><p>She thinks of all the times they’ve been here before, the way Rio had always helped her up to sit on the edge of the bathroom sink closest to the barred window, the way her nails bit into her hips just long enough to press her ass into cold porcelain. </p><p> </p><p>Now her touch lingered, a steady anchor that stood against the ebb and flow of her breathing. </p><p> </p><p>She can’t regret the way her knees open so easily for Rio’s hips to fit between her thighs, enough room for Rio to be so close. The way the press of her gaze steadies her somehow, held like something to cherish. Agatha melts at the care in Rio’s movements, pressing her fingers over the lacy finish to her dress, firm enough to cover the purple fabric bunched slightly around her hips, but gentle too, doing her best to keep her centered on the edge of the sink. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallows, retracing all the other times they’d been like this, her standard uniform skirt wrinkled up just enough to expose her thighs to the chill of the petulant air conditioner, perhaps a means of freezing out every student who dared step out of line. </p><p> </p><p>But now, it’s not the hem of her dark blue skirt, but her prom dress slowly moving higher. The goosebumps blooming along her thighs countering the heat climbing up her chest, one of Rio’s hands perched against her jaw to hold her in place, the other pressing into her insistently.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath catches against her own, a kiss that has yet to bloom, but eyes that stare with a deep hunger, a craze that Agatha was starting to chase. And Rio’s own dress, a dark green cascade of fabric, was its own obstacle, Agatha’s hands raking over her covered chest, willing herself to hold black from ripping the satin away and replacing it with her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>Rio angles up Agatha’s jaw for brown and blue to reconnect, a moment to bring them out of the heavy sighs that had yet to connect. Because yeah, this had been Agatha’s exact intention when she pulled Rio out of the gymnasium mid-song and dragged her up the stairs to their designated rendezvous point, but now Rio was catching her in the ploy, smug. Rio smirks at her, hand pressing against her cheek, solid and happy with herself. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha paws at her side, because she can, growing more and more impatient as the seconds tick by without Rio touching her. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re so pretty when you’re desperate.” Rio grins into her as she finally connects their lips, a short kiss that Agatha breaks to speak.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m always desperate for you.” </p><p> </p><p>She only realizes the full sentiment she’d just confirmed after the fact. </p><p> </p><p><em>You’re always pretty.</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t have to say it plainly, the way she bites Agatha’s lower lip is enough of a sting to her fragile-yet blossoming self-image. The truth of Rio’s desire had been a safe jumping off point to start seeing herself as something worthy.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio praised her, held her like something to be worshipped. </p><p> </p><p>She pulls up her dress further, exposing her thighs to Rio as they continue to kiss, a passionate press as Rio keeps her solidly in place, needing the warmth of her hands to settle over cold flesh. Rio chuckles into the kiss, the spoken desperation clearly on display again.</p><p> </p><p>”You want me to touch you?” Rio whispers a hair away from her mouth, clearly amused, her teasing undeterred as Agatha grips her hair, pulling at the waves Rio had struggled with a curling iron for. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs at Rio’s wrist, not ready to beg with words just yet, sliding Rio’s hand towards the inside of her thigh, bucking forward just enough to get Rio closer, her thighs fulling pressing into her hips, her knees bracing around her. </p><p> </p><p>“We’re supposed to be downstairs, slow dancing with boys and drinking un-spiked punch.” Rio murmurs, but doesn’t pull away, instead working her mouth over the side of Agatha’s neck, brushing her straightened hair away with her nose, biting to seal her desire, a need to hear Agatha’s breathing change. She presses her fingers over the skin of her inner thigh dragging her fingers delicately, before roughly squeezing the flesh. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whimpers, something close to pleading. </p><p> </p><p>She reaches behind Rio, done with having no control, finding the zipper to her dress and pulling down, the lack of straps making it easy to pull down the front, thumb over Rio’s nipples before she can find any certain protests. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles now, elated to claim her power again, Rio crumbling forward to connect their lips again as Agatha’s nails scratch over her chest, leaving red marks that still sting as her attention grows more pointed, squeezing both nipples between her fingers, a shaky moan swallowed into Agatha’s mouth. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re pretty when you’re desperate.” Agatha echoes, vindictive, proud, as Rio tries to catch her breath, thrown too quickly towards pleasure. </p><p> </p><p>”What if someone finds us up here?” She asks, ignoring the previous attempt at riling her up, holding both of Agatha’s hands before they can set her on fire again.</p><p> </p><p>”Better make it quick then.” Agatha hums, pulling her hands from Rio’s grasp before wrapping her fingers around her throat, her other hand pulling the front of Rio’s dress further down, scratching against her rib cage and stomach. </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t make it quick. Letting Agatha take her time to pull at her, tease her for an extra moment before kissing her again, content in Agatha’s pressure against her neck. She grips Agatha’s thighs, Rio finally agreeing that Agatha’s dress needs to be handled, her hands snake under it until she’s grabbing as much of her ass as she can without removing her from the surface of the sink, pulling her up to rest against her. </p><p> </p><p>The new angle forces Agatha’s hand off her throat, but her hands take their place over Rio’s shoulders, Agatha’s hips humping forward, seeking the bit of friction she finds against Rio’s stomach. </p><p> </p><p>Rio kisses her like missing prom doesn’t matter to her, like the money spent on dresses, the time spent on makeup was all meant for this, like Agatha is the thing she’d only experience once, a memory to savor. Agatha holds on like this is the night she’d choose over and over again, a need in her soul to claim this girl regardless of the consequences. </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Agatha leans back enough for Rio’s hand to return to her inner thigh, one hand over Rio’s shoulders, the other braced behind her on the sink, watching in awe as Rio’s fingers disappear into the small space between them. She watches Rio’s face as slim fingers tug at the corner of her panties, the wetness of the fabric cold as it loses contact with her skin. She can feel herself flutter already, the gnawing anticipation in her stomach suddenly bursting as Rio angles up, pushes the fabric to the side and finally meets her arousal. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha swears she sees Rio’s eyes darken further as two fingers explore the feel of her for another moment, the truth settling into her head that she’d been the reason for Agatha being so turned on. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes fall closed, equally lost in the feeling, her head falling to smack their foreheads together. Agatha gasps at the contact, her hips moving to help Rio find a pattern that wasn’t awed exploration. </p><p> </p><p>“Baby” Rio voices, before kissing her again, a proclamation of overwhelm that she couldn’t put real words to. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha moans into her mouth as Rio finally starts applying intention pressure, conscious circles around her swollen clit, bracing towards Agatha as close as possible, feeling the way Agatha’s body already started stiffening. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha sits up straighter, swallowing her own breath, trying to focus on the feeling without it taking her over completely, the walls threatening to shoot up, the vulnerability still feeling like something to conceal. </p><p> </p><p>Rio only follows the movement, keeps her fingers moving, a slow pattern that works its way faster, firmer. She rocks back with Agatha, not letting her subconscious claw her out of it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s legs open further, the sound of stretching fabric filling the room previously only occupied by the sound of a leaking faucet and needy breathing, a year ago, the chance of ripping her dress would have stopped her from staying a second longer. A year ago, Rio wouldn’t be fucking her against the sink in a public bathroom in their high school. </p><p> </p><p>She finally lets go of her breath, the release hot against Rio’s mouth, the thundering succession of breaths that follow it equally splintered by Rio’s kisses. </p><p> </p><p>The needy whimpers that follow sing across the row of mirrors, the sobering reality that the stalls lay empty, but that the door was unguarded, not even the choice of locking it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can feel the coil in her stomach, the heat of Rio soft and centering, but the fear that still rang in her brain to never give up control. She scratches over exposed shoulder blades, scrapes at Rio’s collarbone earning her own gasp. A tightening continues that doesn’t feel like approaching the edge, but a firm wall stopping the climb.</p><p> </p><p>”Do you want me to stop?” Rio asks, as Agatha reangles herself again, somehow reading the hesitation so easily. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grasps Rio’s working wrist, her fingers tracing over her jaw. “No.” She shakes her head, finding the clarity behind the desire in Rio’s eyes “Please, make me cum.”</p><p> </p><p><em>And there’s the begging.</em> </p><p> </p><p>The solid warmth against her suddenly shifts back just a fraction, she hears Rio’s knees hit the floor, a bang that might carry down 2 floors and over the music. The flash of tan skin and green dress sinking down without warning as arms snake around her thighs, her panties held to the side with fingers wrapped over the top, Rio’s tongue making contact without hesitation. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>Jesus Christ.”</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand grips the back of Rio’s head overwhelmed again but unable to find the hesitance again, her brain fully giving in to the magic of Rio’s mouth, pulling her hair as she groans, grinding down into the pressure. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breathing changes as Rio continues to devour her, soaring up as the  heaving thunders forward, her thighs pressing closed around her head and Rio seeming content to suffocate there. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio, baby.” Agatha claws desperately, trying to find her breath, scratching her scalp, trying to maintain her balance, before Rio angles forward, supporting more of Agatha’s weight, securing her in position, not letting her fall. </p><p> </p><p>“Relax, baby” Rio prays against the top of her pussy, her own breathing deep and out of control, the wet coating her mouth only partially visible. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, unsure if she would ever be able to tell Rio no from between her legs, keeping the eye contact, as she drags Rio’s face forward again, even as she goes willingly, her tongue solid over her clit, sucking slightly before flicking her tongue side to side, her face moving with it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes slip closed as she sinks deeper, overtaken by the meal laid out for her, blissfully downing in the taste as her tongue dips inside her. </p><p> </p><p>“Fingers.” Agatha demands, pulling Rio’s hair enough to shift her high enough to make her look at her again, she grabs her jaw, makes sure Rio knows. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>Now</em> you want my fingers?” Rio smirks, an unsaid joke about Agatha being needy or indecisive that she’d never actually mean.</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a second to readjust, needing to keep Agatha steady but also move one of her hands, she presses two fingers into her, a dutiful girlfriend who’s great at listening to directions. She closes her eyes again, delving back in to reattach her mouth over Agatha’s clit. Her fingers slow and filling, the ease of the movement making Agatha squeak. </p><p> </p><p>But the firm tug on her hair returns, a broken groan coming past her lips, Rio shakes at the pleasure of Agatha’s pulling her hair, her own walls clenching around nothing as her knees wobble slightly, feeling deprived of eating her out after being interrupted again. </p><p> </p><p>“I want you to...” Agatha trails off, losing her strength as Rio gazes up at her, half smug, but radiating a yearning that forces Agatha to swallow her own spit. </p><p> </p><p>Rio blinks, but her eyes reopen before Agatha can miss blown pupils and the dopey needy expression on the upper half of Rio’s face. Rio’s fingers press in a little harsher, both of them suddenly aware of them again, Agatha lurching into them. </p><p> </p><p>“Tell me.” Rio demands. </p><p> </p><p><em>Tell me what you want.</em></p><p> </p><p><em>I’ll do anything you want. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Look at me.” Agatha grabs a full fist of hair now, a play at giving Rio more of the feeling that shook her before, another reason to listen, “Look at me while you’re fucking me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio licks over her again, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s, obeying quickly, her fingers slowly moving again, she finds the secure pace, watches as Agatha’s face contorts, her eyebrows furrowing, her mouth hanging open as her breathing picks up again, drowns out any thoughts that stray from this. She doesn’t let go of Rio’s hair, holding on for both of them, rocking her hips into Rio’s mouth and fingers. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can see the sweeping care in Rio’s face, the swell of determination as she builds closer and closer to the edge, the untamed want. It breaks the void, the part of her heart she was trying to protect, Rio had that now too. </p><p> </p><p>She fights the instinct to close her eyes, the overwhelming pleasure coursing through her, the shrill whine that leaves her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>She can’t remember Rio getting up from the floor, but the next thing she remembers is the safety of Rio’s arms, holding her together like she isn’t doing a perfect impression of oozing slime right now, sagging over Rio as she comes down from her orgasm. She doesn’t remember when she’d closed her eyes, but she opens them to find Rio’s collarbone, the echo of a scratch from her own hands. She presses her lips over it. A soft kiss to mark herself alive. Rio shudders against her, still holding strong. </p><p> </p><p>Rio steps back after a moment, tilting awkwardly to wave her hand in front of the paper towel dispenser. She tries to wipe the paper over her mouth, clean away some of Agatha’s mess, but soft hands steal it away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slips to her feet, wobbly but certain, keeping Rio close, she wraps her arms around Agatha’s torso as she wipes delicately around her mouth, along her chin, pressing a soft kiss to her lips when she’s finished. </p><p> </p><p>The soft moment shifts as Agatha finds the strength to turn them around, Rio’s ass now pressing into the sink that Agatha had just occupied. Rio gasps, letting Agatha hold her in place, kissing her mouth like she’s chasing the remnants of her own taste. </p><p> </p><p>But Agatha finds another flex of her will, turning Rio around again, pressing her hips forward, Rio’s back against her chest now. </p><p> </p><p>She finds Rio’s eyes in the mirror, her dress still pulled down to expose her chest. Agatha runs her hands over flushed skin, a gentle trace over the blunt marks left by her nails. She kisses down the side of Rio’s neck, her fingers find the peak of her sternum down over her ribs, marks a path back to a still hardened nipple as Rio’s hands look for somewhere to settle, unable to grab at anything other than Agatha’s moving hands. </p><p> </p><p>Noticing the small whimpers and unsteady stance, she stops the soft exploration of her hands and mouth, grabbing at Rio’s hips and pushing her firmly into the porcelain. </p><p> </p><p>“Hands on the sink, baby.” Agatha commands softly, a voice that never edges towards anger or grief, just a definite direction, ease in the way she knew Rio would obey.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands grip tightly over the sides of the sink as she lets out a hurried breath. Looking back up to meet Agatha’s gaze, blue eyes only stay stagnant for a moment, locked briefly on the veins in Rio’s hands, the flex of her fingers, her eyes trailing up over the front of her body. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands glide from her hips sinking back to grab Rio’s ass, squeezing slightly through the ruffled fabric, the undone zipper sitting close to the top of her hands. She kisses down Rio’s shoulders towards her spine, reveling in the goosebumps and shivers.</p><p> </p><p>The intimacy felt like looking into the sun, a blistering heat that pushed the fear out of her lungs, spurred on by every small reaction she could coax out of the girl in front of her with a firm squeeze or a gentle kiss. </p><p> </p><p>A noise echoes suddenly through their ears, a break from the uncomplicated reverie of closeness and truth. It sounds like a door closing or a book falling. Not super close by, but close enough to spark movement. </p><p> </p><p>“We should go back,” Rio squeaks, but doesn’t move her hands off the sink, doesn’t pull away from Agatha’s hold. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhales, bringing her eyes back to find Rio’s through the mirror, lifting Rio’s jaw for her, her hand around her throat to fulfill the connection. She kisses the side of Rio’s neck once more, a wistful gleam in blue eyes like she’s saying goodbye to this moment, tying a bow on it to come back to later, a memory she wants to remain tangible. </p><p> </p><p>Rio straightens up slightly as Agatha pulls at the sagging fabric of my dress, lifting it up and back into place, covering up most of the scratch marks. Agatha idly thinks about acquiring the right concealer to cover them off, taking the time to kiss over each line before pressing makeup over them.</p><p> </p><p>For now, she shrugs it up, Rio’s hands finally coming off the sink to help her hold it in place, allowing her to zip it up, an unsaid agreement for them to get out of this bathroom before a noise sounded closer, before the door had a chance to swing open again. </p><p> </p><p>Rio turns around again, a new wave of how right it feels to be in her space, the security of arms around her, the brush of Rio’s nose against her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stifles a laugh against her, overcome with the scent of herself on Rio’s face. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” Rio asks, soft, curious.</p><p> </p><p>”You smell like me.” Agatha chuckles at the way Rio’s face curls up slowly into a smile half smug, half shame.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pumps soap into her hand, shifts to turn on the sink adding a little water, Rio doesn’t let go of her, stays close. She bites her lip watching as Agatha rubs over her mouth, along the lower half of her face, the tip of her nose. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you think I’d look good with a beard?” Rio’s eyebrows dance as Agatha cleans her up. </p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha smiles, “I like your face.”</p><p> </p><p>”You like my tongue.” Rio corrects, tilting forward trying to kiss Agatha even though she still has soap on her face.</p><p> </p><p>“That too.” Agatha slips back, avoiding the contact, “uh-uh, no kisses until you’re clean.”</p><p> </p><p>”<em>Funny</em>” Rio presses, “You wanted kisses a minute ago”</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>The DJ is playing early 2000’s pop, clean versions of funky rap songs. It’s not awful. Better than the instrumental hymns played in Bible study. </p><p> </p><p>There’s soda and food, but she’s not exactly hungry for that. Still keen on other activities.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wishes she could be closer to Rio, wrapped up in her again in a way that didn’t spell friends. Catholic girls who sat with their ankles crossed and never dreamed of sinning.</p><p> </p><p>”You sure you don’t want to dance?” Rio leans towards her, their seats a safe distance away, the dim lighting covering her blush. A question she’d asked twice already, playing their game of waiting for Agatha to give in, slowly chewing her down.</p><p> </p><p>The moment makes her feel convincingly young, a profound sense that this is a launching point, when to most of her peers it probably feels like an end. Without Rio, she’s knows she would have never even attended prom, the thought never in her mind until Evanora granted her permission. But she doesn’t want to think about the journey that had launched them on, doesn’t want to think about her mother at all. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugs.</p><p> </p><p>”We can go find an empty classroom,” Agatha looks into her plastic cup of sprite, unable to meet Rio’s eyes despite what they’d just been doing, “I’m sure we can find one where the door locks.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks, but shakes her head. </p><p> </p><p>“And when my parents ask ‘how was prom?’ what are we gonna tell them?” Rio challenges, her eyebrows raised, her eyes still wanting.</p><p> </p><p>”I <em>was</em> having a great time,” Agatha rolls her eyes, her gaze training back towards the dance floor, watching girls awkwardly proposition shy boys to dance with them, a wall of adult chaperones making sure they’re leaving room for Jesus. </p><p> </p><p>“Hmm,” Rio hums, content to let Agatha have this argument, even if she had no intention of giving in.</p><p> </p><p>“Or we can go home early, I can get you off in your comfy bed.” Agatha offers, cut off suddenly by her own yelp as RIo reaches down to pinch her thigh. ”Ow!”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop asking, princess.” Rio winks, “The chariot will be back at 9:30.” </p><p> </p><p><em>The limo</em>. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha cringes, playing unaffected, truly concerned with how easily Rio pulls her back towards reality, when an unbiased mind would not swoon at Rio’s goofy charm. That coupled with the curdling want in her chest was enough to make her pout.</p><p> </p><p>She barely got to touch Rio. A travesty. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha checks her phone. 7:04. They’d only been here an hour. </p><p> </p><p>The frustration mounted as she continued to watch her classmates, the boys from their sister-school. A reminder that this was not an image of her glory days, that she could barely hold together her anticipation for graduation in another week, that she was ready for this chapter to be over.</p><p> </p><p>She was ready for summer. For days that weren’t filled with the implications of her mother. For freedom. A final sigh at the childhood she’d tried her best to scrape together. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Rio pulls her attention again, her fingers grazing over her knee, “Can we dance, please? Just for a few minutes.”</p><p> </p><p>And the pull of brown eyes, the soft curve of her lips. It’s enough to remember to savor the chance.</p><p> </p><p>They don’t leave room for Jesus, Rio’s hands flush against her back, Agatha’s arms wrapped around her shoulders, a sway of bodies more than a calculated dance. She doesn’t dare kiss her here, aware of the real consequences lurking in the shadows. </p><p> </p><p>But the beat swoops over all the harsh edges, dulls out the pain just enough. Rio smiles showing the gap in her teeth and Agatha remembers being 14, the heat of sleeping bags and salty popcorn, the birthplace of silly crushes. </p><p> </p><p>It feels like a continuation, she realizes, another chapter she’s been blessed to write with her own words. Not a beginning. Not an end. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha would never close the book now. Not when it’s just starting to get good. </p>

<p>Baruch 4:1- She is the book of the precepts of God, the law that endures forever; all who cling to her will live, but those will die who forsake her. </p><p> </p><p>Summer swung in like a buzzing current of cicadas and heat. Not necessarily the actual definition of the season, but the days after their last day of high school and the time before starting college, a September that would mark more change than falling leaves. </p><p> </p><p>Rio swore it was raining more than usual, something about climate change and how the world was surging towards a new beginning, but Agatha liked to watch the rain drops fall against Rio’s windowsill, trace over the clouds and find the shapes carved in the fluff.</p><p> </p><p>She still thought of God as a generous painter, an artist flicking pinks over sordid sunsets, perhaps a man doing his best to tell a story in the brush strokes, steering the course of winds and precipitation, a finger guiding her forward but not in full control. </p><p> </p><p>It had been easier to press away the dark parts with Evanora out of sight, replace the quaking wrongs of sin with the broad strokes of gospel, trying to be good. </p><p> </p><p>And still, Rio encouraged the parts of her that felt like evil, not in the vein of committing to it, but truly feeling the freedom of her own will, finding the paths that felt like the real Agatha and unlearn the cadence of her mother’s expectations. </p><p> </p><p>There are days that feel like loses, days that make her yearn for the comfort of Rio’s arms and nothing else. Their warm bed and the desire to turn off the rest of the world. And the Vidal’s ease around the hurdle of it like it’s a burden they’re willing to shoulder. Like Agatha is a tadpole still learning to swim, no judgement cast on the way she’s still growing. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mother will bring up bowls of soup, kiss the top of Agatha’s head. She won’t coax her out of the cocoon with words, but hums to her on bad days, crawls next to her a few times, holds her close in place of the solid orbit of her daughter.</p><p> </p><p>It stitches closed a hole in her heart, a void that felt like a mother could never see her as worthy, a place now taken up by a family she fell into by chance. </p><p> </p><p>And when she does make it downstairs, Mr. Vidal doesn’t placate her absence, simply smiles like he’s happy to see her up, asks her what she wants to watch, hands her the remote. </p><p> </p><p>Rio will brush her hair for her, kiss over her shoulders, a touch that evens out her breaths, pulls her back from the panic waiting around the corner. </p><p> </p><p>But there are also good days. A June filled with sunshine and a glow returning to blue eyes. Rio drives them to the beach, teaches Agatha how to skip rocks, rubs sunscreen on her back like it’s her job. Rio holds her up in the water, Agatha’s thighs securely wrapped around her waist, Rio’s toes skimming the bottom. The water comes just over Agatha’s belly button, the waves ebbing shyly, Rio soaring to keep each peak below their eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“If I got stung by a jelly fish, would you pee on me?” Rio asks, her brown eyes finding gold in the sunlight, her hair wet and slicked back, her arms locked around Agatha’s butt, half concentrated on squeezing her and half focused on keeping her in place. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha scowls, but doesn’t let go, digs her nails into boney shoulders as punishment. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you have a pissing kink I should know about?” Agatha tilts her head closer, curious and challenging.</p><p> </p><p>”I have a you kink.” Rio bites her own lip, the gap in her front teeth still making Agatha blush. </p><p> </p><p>She rolls her eyes, pressing out of their embrace, “You’re insufferable.” Agatha chimes, her feet finding the ocean floor again. “L rizz”.</p><p> </p><p>Rio only laughs, grabbing at Agatha’s hips in an effort to keep her close, her face falling into her sternum to conceal her laugh against the soaked skin. </p><p> </p><p>“You like it.” She claims, soft and certain against her chest. </p><p> </p><p>“Mmm” Agatha hums, her nails finding Rio’s scalp, scratching slightly, a piece of comfort for them both. “I could drown you right now.” Agatha continues, no bite, just telling, “make it look like an accident.”</p><p> </p><p>Brown eyes peek up, no indication of fear, charged by the serene heat of the sun coupled with the soaring ache of Rio’s skin pressed into hers.</p><p> </p><p>”It would be an honor to be your first victim, darling.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha breaks away again, “Yeah, yeah” her eyes roll once more like it’s the only reaction she’s capable of, using the new space between them to splash water at Rio, the spray hitting her face.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks scandalized, the blaze of her irises filled with blooming interest, a wonderful occasion whenever Rio meets Agatha’s instigation with the same fire. She splashes back, a high pitched squeal finding the air as the cold salt water gets into her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes the moment of surprise to tackle her, bring Agatha back into her arms but also fully under the water, she can hear the gasp that leaves her mouth as she pulls them both under.</p><p> </p><p>They surface a few seconds later, Agatha’s arms firm around Rio’s shoulders, clinging tightly in a way she wasn’t before, the presence of fear suddenly here, but the clarity of Rio as a pillar also solid and somewhere to land.</p><p> </p><p>”I got you,” Rio whispers, holding Agatha tighter than before, giving her just enough space to wipe the water from her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not scared.” Agatha pouts, her fingers flexing harder over her collar bone.</p><p> </p><p>Rio just smirks, cradles her close, presses a kiss to the side of her head. </p><p> </p><p>They track sand into Rio’s car, their hair still dripping over the leather even after Rio does her best attempt at towel drying both of their heads. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hits shuffle on one of Rio’s summer playlists, feels the exhaustion from being in the sunlight all day start to creep in, they stop at a deli for sandwiches and chips, Rio peels the tomatoes off of hers and steals half of Agatha’s Doritos. </p><p> </p><p>The sun is setting by the time they make it back into the drive way, the swirl of purples and blues sagging over the falling light, a reminder of the constant rings of change, a new day waiting for them. </p><p> </p><p>There are check in’s with Yelena every other week, conversations that warp over the healing scars, phone calls that feel like what Agatha assumes therapy is like. But no news. Just a continuing investigation. Nothing to hold onto.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gets a text from Jen one Tuesday night asking if she’s okay unprompted. A picture attached. Police cars sitting outside her house. Evanora’s house. </p><p> </p><p>It makes her chest sting, a crushing pressure that yields her breathing. She shows Rio her phone, wordless and unsure. A quiet that holds weight. </p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls up the website for their county jail, scrolls through several pages of mugshots, but comes up empty. An open question lingering without answer.</p><p> </p><p>She texts Jen back, short and reassuring. But the words feel stale, an abyss of unknown.</p><p> </p><p>Rio holds her close, soft whispers into her hair, brushes tears of frustration away with delicate hands. </p><p> </p><p>They fill their days with happy things, an attempt at squeezing as much as possible into their last few months of freedom. Agatha begs Rio to take her to the library, always offers to take care of the grocery shopping, starts a routine of nightly walks around the neighborhood, anything to get out of the house, anything to see the sun.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s birthday comes in a blink. She asks for nothing special, a chocolate cake and a gift card from her parents. She smiles wide at the camera of Agatha’s phone, a paper party hat bringing the look together. Agatha loses her breath as Rio blows out her candles, an image of the girl she’d met freshman year, the person who’d changed her for the better, the woman she was watching grow up, a thundering in her chest at the truth of their connection. </p><p> </p><p>Upstairs in the privacy of Rio’s room, Agatha slides a piece of paper towards Rio, a crisp piece of loose leaf, no wrinkles or folds, polished letters of Agatha’s handwriting.</p><p> </p><p>A poem. </p><p> </p><p>It felt ironic, the way Rio had always written in secret, how she never let anyone read from her little black notebook. And now, Agatha was trusting her own words to be read by Rio’s eyes, the healing attempt at crafting her own feelings for the world in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>”I know it’s not much,” Agatha doesn’t look up, keeps her eyes trained on her own words, suddenly insecure, “Happy Birthday”</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes the paper, tentative and grounded, trying to stake herself in this reality. </p><p> </p><p>The ease of soil carves home into her eyes</p><p>Planted roots firm against the precious features of her cheeks</p><p>I ride the wave of lips tilted into serene glory</p><p>Like in looking at me she’s already won</p><p> </p><p>She touches me like I am porcelain, delicate and refined</p><p>A heirloom that no one saw the treasure in before her</p><p>Not until the torch of her fingertips grazed against me </p><p>A ladybug that knows she’s meant to fly</p><p> </p><p>I reach in empty pockets, I try to repay her</p><p>But she sings a song of practiced surplus</p><p>A field of azaleas that never die</p><p>A joy that learns to replant itself</p><p> </p><p>”It’s…” Rio’s eyes well with tears, her fingers flexing, “Thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t place the soft shake of her voice, a power that climbs in the way her own words could stir Rio’s mind, the tangible strength transferred through them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio surges towards her like she’d never want to instigate space between them ever again. “it’s perfect,” she whispers into her, a lilt of syllables that Agatha sears across her heart. </p><p> </p><p>Church is still every Sunday, a sample of the life they’re used to living, a sense of stability. But no Evanora, her presence stripped. No one asks about her mother, the only offerings are tight lipped smiles and gentle nods. Agatha is happy to save her own breath. </p><p> </p><p>“Do we have to go to church forever?” Agatha asks one Sunday after mass. </p><p> </p><p>They’ve escaped to the playground outside the church, Rio’s parents still inside exchanging pleasantries. Both of them on the swings, a calm pace of back and forth. </p><p> </p><p>“No.” Rio looks at her, open and understanding.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m not saying I’ll never go back, I just-“ but the explanation leaves her mind, a crooked self-loathing that still presses down on her throat, a callous collapse of risking her loyalty. </p><p> </p><p>But Rio just smiles at her, slowing her own swing, soft and unblemished by doubt. An understanding, the fight for a life that didn’t feel like a coarse battle of disappointing a god that might not exist. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha knows Rio isn’t looking at her any differently, her level of belief never a mystery. Rio went to church for her parents, went to Catholic school because she got a scholarship, not because of some unwavering belief. But the coil in Agatha’s mind still snaps, like she’d let herself down, gave up on the faith that had gotten her through most of her life.</p><p> </p><p>”It’s hard,” Rio’s voice comes to life beside her, breaking her out of her inner turmoil, “figuring out what you really believe, when we’ve been spoonfed this shit since birth. Questioning it doesn’t make you evil.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, trying to believe her. </p><p> </p><p>The phone calls start in the first week of July. Evanora’s name popping up on her screen, ‘Mom’ reflecting over her face as she watches letting it ring. </p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t tell Rio. Allows the fear to anchor back over her skin, fights the pull to fall back under. Agatha knows they have nothing to say to each other, that her mother’s voice would only renew the spiral. </p><p> </p><p>But this new life has made her less cautious, less guarded. So she isn’t as protective of the secrets that lie behind her passcode, doesn’t think twice about leaving her phone to charge on the kitchen counter. </p><p> </p><p>Rio is cutting vegetables, preparing dinner before her parents get home from work. Agatha is stirring a pot on the stove that probably needs to be left alone, but she needs to give her hands something to do. </p><p> </p><p>An old jazz tune plays from her father’s record player, an extra tangible piece of domesticity. Agatha watches Rio’s side profile, the way her jaw tightens with focus, the pattern of chopping sounds against the cutting board. She dreams of staying in this moment forever, the perfect view of her favorite person, brown hair tied back in a hurried ponytail, strands hanging loose around her face, the flex of her arms, the warm scent of spices. A feeling of home. </p><p> </p><p>The piercing vibration launches her out of the crystal reverie, a rumbling of shock, her phone screen lighting up in front of Rio’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>’Mom’</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks up, her brow furrowed, her lips falling open in a silent question, only settling slightly as Agatha meets her gaze, suddenly dropping the wooden spoon to rest on the lip of the pot, closing the two foot distance between them, she grabs her phone, taps on the decline button without a second of hesitation. </p><p> </p><p>Rio pauses, swallows, angles herself differently, tries to find the right way to ask. Agatha can see the second guessing there, the firm attempt at trying.</p><p> </p><p>Despite the haunting surge of grief at remembering Evanora’s existence, there is still a jolt of fire that flashes behind her ribs, a spark climbing towards Rio, an ache at the way this person cared for her. </p><p> </p><p>“Was that the first time she’s called since you’ve been here?” Rio asks, her tone soft but edging towards unaffected, trying not to scare away the vulnerability with a harsh interrogation, her gaze trained over the cutting board.</p><p> </p><p>”No,” Agatha answers honestly, “She called yesterday, and the day before.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s an easy truth to tell, the fact that they’ve spent almost every waking minute together for the last month or so easily offers it credibility. If Agatha spoke to her mother, Rio would know. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha waits for the next question, knows its coming with the way she can feel Rio thinking.</p><p> </p><p>”Do you want to speak to her?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha touches Rio’s wrist, guides her hand to put down the knife, forces Rio to look at her. </p><p> </p><p>She can see the remnants of insecurity in brown eyes, the fear that Agatha would try to forgive Evanora, try to mend the broken life she’d known for 18 years. It isn’t anger, it isn’t frustration. It’s Rio holding the blame for them both, understanding to a fault, that she’d never be mad at Agatha for having hope, even if it felt pointless.</p><p> </p><p>”No” Agatha offers, just above a whisper, her hand cradling the side of Rio’s face, a soft timber of conviction, the truth. </p><p> </p><p>The rumbling noise sounds again, the phone vibrating against the countertop. </p><p> </p><p>“She’s never going to stop, is she?” Agatha sighs, her voice feeling weak as she reaches for her phone to hit the decline button once more. </p><p> </p><p>But Rio swipes it before she can get there, a stark determination as she stares at the screen for an extra second, making peace with her own plan in her mind.</p><p> </p><p>”Not if we answer.” Rio argues.</p><p> </p><p>”Rio, don’t!”</p><p> </p><p>But her thumb hits the green button before she can stop her, gripping the device like it’s a lifeline as she puts it on speaker and says “hello”.</p><p> </p><p>Rio steps back from Agatha, forcing space between them for the time being, turning her body to shield the phone in case Agatha tries to grab it from her. Agatha curls forward, her posture slumped over the counter and remaining quiet, bracing for whatever comes of this, keeping her own mouth firmly shut now that her mother had a chance to hear.</p><p> </p><p>”Who’s this?” Evanora’s voice feels like gasoline on a fire, a callous invitation to cry, it isn’t warm and gentle, it burns like lifting sunburn, an itch that has her peeling skin.</p><p> </p><p>”This is Rio. Who’s this?” her voice rings in a calm ease that Evanora could never achieve, meeting her jilted challenge with tranquil air.</p><p> </p><p>”Where’s Agatha?” Of course Evanora avoids Rio’s question. The grating of her name on her mother’s lips still makes her mouth feel sour, she digs her own nails into her arm.</p><p> </p><p>Rio notices the tense shift, turns back to pry Agatha’s nails away from her arm, turns her hand over to allow Agatha to grip onto her, squeezes twice, an indication that Agatha could squeeze back.</p><p> </p><p>”She’s not available right now, can I take a message?” Rio responds easily, wanting Evanora to know she held no power over her, that she wasn’t afraid, would not bend to her will. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora huffs like she’s been terribly inconvenienced.</p><p> </p><p>It dawns on Agatha that nothing has changed.</p><p> </p><p>That in the wake of her leaving, the investigation, the mountain of healing she’s started to climb- Evanora is still the same.</p><p> </p><p>An evil shell of a human, who will never take accountability, who will never feel guilty, who isn’t even willing to fake an apology, to fake regret. </p><p> </p><p>It stings like a hand too close to the burner, a blister that pops without warning. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been desperate for closure, and maybe this was a piece of it.</p><p> </p><p>”Tell her I’m done paying her phone bill”</p><p> </p><p>The call ends without another breath.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs, something close to a laugh. Because the gleaming force of her mother’s audacity is simply impossible to fully grasp.</p><p> </p><p>The one thing she was left providing for her, deemed too much to carry for Evanora Harkness.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio sighs, “Maybe I shouldn’t have done that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha says in place of giving any life to Rio’s insecurity, she doesn’t feel like she’ll ever be able to say the words enough. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath changes slightly, relaxing as Agatha pulls her in by her t-shirt, kisses Rio, slow and bruising. They stop here, breathe each other in, a comfort Agatha’s bones will never get tired of.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s arms circle around Rio’s waist, press her back into the counter, the pop of a sharp hip hitting marble. It shakes the damage loose, gives the pain the freedom to swim away, Agatha holds tighter to Rio, wanting to keep her forever, to remember every frantic piece of her desire, drag away all the trauma laced around it. </p><p> </p><p>She fears she can’t entirely separate the two, not yet. But Rio’s eyes shine like they have time, like kissing her can last a lifetime. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha is crying, not forceful sobbing, but her throat closes around the sound, the stream of tears shocking and cool on her cheeks. Rio holds her face, brushes her thumbs over the tracks, a gentle resolve in her patience. </p><p> </p><p>Blue eyes don’t close, Agatha doesn’t pull away or try to hide her face. She looks at Rio with a fevered certainty that makes her shiver, a wonder in her eyes at the marvel of what life can truly be. </p><p> </p><p>She helps Rio finish the chopping, sets the table, memorizes the lines of Rio’s lips, never lets the contact die completely. She keeps moving, not because of the anxiety perched over her like a vulture waiting for fresh meat, but because tomorrow is always waiting, and she plans on living there. </p><p> </p><p>It only takes two days for Agatha’s phone to get added to their family plan, born out of a conversation Rio had with her parents that Agatha wasn’t privy to. Rio’s father spills the secret without meaning to, bragging about how they were actually saving money by adding a fourth line.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha holds back the shattering ache at being folded in with ease, never a burden. She starts to learn the meaning of family, this is the closest she’s ever gotten to it. A place where connection was practiced and preached, where love was not an idea, but a real solid thing stirred into every home cooked meal, sewn into every mended shirt, cradled and cared for in every touch, in every shared laugh, in every look.</p><p> </p><p>Summer heat pulls them under like a spell of unbalanced war, a heat that invades thin sheets and forces them to put a hold on full body cuddling some nights, Agatha’s fingers brushing over Rio’s forearm. The air conditioner stops working mid morning while both of Rio’s parents are working. They take turns standing in front of Rio’s old dusty fan until the gleam of sweat reaches far past attractive. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha isn’t sure how they end up in the shower together, no verbal plan. She giggles at the speed at which Rio’s hands come around her back to pop her bra open, a race to get under the stream of cool water. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha allows Rio to take most of the water directly, her body facing the shower head, Agatha pressed into her back, her arms wrapped around her front.</p><p> </p><p>The intent isn’t nefarious, but her fingers rake over Rio’s abdomen, caress over her ribs, rub lightly over hardened nipples, stiff under the cold water. When Rio shivers, Agatha gives herself the credit for it.</p><p> </p><p>She rests her face in the crevice when Rio’s neck meets her shoulder, not exactly kissing, but her lips snuggly held against soft skin, content to stay there as Rio washes her face. </p><p> </p><p>“You falling asleep?” Rio’s voice barely makes it over the sounds around them.</p><p> </p><p>”Mmm,” Agatha hums, not willing to move just yet. </p><p> </p><p>Rio turns in her arms, body wash in hand, a team effort in getting clean. The warmth of Rio’s hands are a soothing balm over the growing goosebumps, a delicate glide of soaped-up hands over her chest, down over her hips and waist, across her lower back and butt, Rio adding enough pressure to have them chest to chest, the soap on their bodies mingling together.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha needs to kiss her, a starved woman in desperate distress over a soft smile meeting her lips, the wet of their faces, the slippery skin, Rio’s fingers flexing around her ass, wanting but patient, a squeeze of possessiveness.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand slides between them, down between Agatha’s legs, caresses over the patch of dark hair, grazes lower with no intention following through, barely brushing over her clit.</p><p> </p><p>A soft whimper escapes Agatha’s mouth at the contact. A huff coming just a moment after as Rio’s hand slides back up, gathering the bubbles over Agatha’s hip.</p><p> </p><p>”Tease,” Agatha complains into Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>”I don’t trust your ability to not slip, baby.” Rio pecks her lips, a shallow smirk Agatha wishes she could swallow whole. </p><p> </p><p>And maybe Rio’s right, Agatha would definitely forget her own balance, probably choke on her own moans as she rocked harder into Rio’s hand, lose her footing and crack open her skull on the side of the tub.</p><p> </p><p>But she definitely wasn’t going to directly admit that.</p><p> </p><p>”That’s why it’s your job to hold me up.” Agatha chastises, sinking forward just enough to test her theory, waiting only a second before Rio’s arms reflexively clenched tighter around her. </p><p> </p><p>“With these noodle arms?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>”We both know you’re stronger than me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles.</p><p> </p><p>”I think you hold back to make me feel better about myself.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scratches over her shoulders, claws down her throat, a hand pressed flat over Rio’s sternum.</p><p> </p><p>”if I was stronger than you, I’d never shut up about it.”</p><p> </p><p>And Rio grins, that goofy tilt of her lips as she spins them back to be fully under the water again, washing away all the suds. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha brushes strands of hair back behind Rio’s ears, kisses the side of her neck, bites over freshly cleaned skin, basks in the residual taste of eucalyptus and tea tree oil. </p><p> </p><p>Rio wraps a towel around Agatha’s shoulders when they step out, grabbing a towel for herself right after, shivering slightly, they stand close together, four feet on a dark blue bath mat, trying to minimize the chance of dripping on the tiled floor. They press their foreheads together, clutching at their own towels. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha angles back to help dry Rio’s face, rubbing gently over her features, soothing away beads of water that slip from wet hair down her forehead, before a shorter attempt at drying her own face. </p><p> </p><p>Rio steps back, grabs another towel from under her sink, the one on her shoulders sagging with the movement, she shrugs it back up before falling to her knees in front of Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>She begins a thorough pattern of worship, drying the top of Agatha’s foot, up her leg and over her thigh, before moving to the other. Agatha reaches for her, a pathetic noise crawling from her throat at the display of worship, the raw intimacy of her care, her fingers scratching over Rio’s scalp.</p><p> </p><p>Brown eyes look up at her, the feel of the fabric costing up her inner thigh, guided by intentional hands, Agatha blinks, doing her best to catalog the overwhelming tenderness as the pressure swirls up over her ass cheeks, Rio leaving a wet kiss on her hip bone. </p><p> </p><p>Being naked in their shared room isn’t exactly new, but there’s a new air to it now. A freeing exaltation at finding clothes to put on in a closet filled with both of their things, no rush to cover up or hide. </p><p> </p><p>“I think I’m gonna have to fight you if you keep stealing my boxers,” Rio complains half-heartedly as she rummages through her underwear drawer by the side of her bed, as if their wardrobes hadn’t been effectively merged from the day Agatha moved all her stuff in. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, but think about how hot I look in them.” Agatha reminds her, trying to find shirts from the closet that will keep them from melting.</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs, shaking her head, stopping herself from tackling Agatha right away. </p><p> </p><p>“Why do we need to put on clothes anyway?” Agatha takes her turn to complain, “I’m already starting to sweat again.”</p><p> </p><p>”If we don’t put on clothes, I’m gonna have to touch you in a rated R way, and then that shower will have been for nothing.” Rio explains, sounding like a kid puzzling out their path of reasoning. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes even if Rio can’t see it.</p><p> </p><p>A moment later, she feels Rio behind her, the creak of the floor under her feet, but also the torturing heat of her body moving closer.</p><p> </p><p>”Here,” Rio offers, wrapping a sheet around Agatha’s shoulders, the cool fabric easily covering her, but also giving her a gentle reprieve from the intense temperature. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels as Rio’s hands delicately pull her damp hair free from under the sheet, gently managing it into a bun on the top of her head, a means of getting it off her neck. </p><p> </p><p>She steps even closer to wrap her arms around Agatha’s waist from behind, their positions from the shower switched, Agatha now cocooned in her hold.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nudges at the top of the sheet with her nose, moves it enough to kiss the back of her neck, a slow path over the top of her spine towards her shoulder blade. She sucks a spot into the side of her neck, a force that has Agatha sighing in relief.</p><p> </p><p>There’s a shock of electricity as Rio’s body seems to sag into her, a quiet stretch of calm that feels like a place to rest. She can feel the swift intake of breath, a preparation for something she’s yet to understand. </p><p> </p><p>“I love you”</p><p> </p><p>The words are spoken like a reverent prayer, an astonished echo of a feeling that has never felt so intentional, so absolutely true. Her tone is sharp, controlled, a measure of the power of honesty, the power of it setting her free. </p><p> </p><p>Still, she can feel the way Rio’s body tenses slightly in the wake of it, half a second of fear, left wondering where that placed Agatha’s feelings.</p><p> </p><p>But the insecurity only lasts a fraction of a second, Agatha’s body jolting into action like a snapped rubber band, her body turns without hesitation, breaking the hold to instigate a new one, chasing the fire of those three words, whispered like they were the creation of everything. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs Rio’s jaw, pushes her backwards without realizing the full consequence, the sound of a pained cry sounding as the back of her head makes contact with the wall, the rough desire of it short circuiting both of their brains. But the short burst of pain is quieted by the certain stroke of Agatha’s lips, kissing Rio like she is the antidote to the poison of the human experience, regarding her with every ounce of her heart, the soaring pulse bouncing in her ear drum, the spiral of want blooming in her stomach, the way her palms itched to hold her.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe she should have said it back before kissing her, but the instinct to be close won out, the force of her love overflowing her heart, silencing the worry in her mind, a seed finally finding soil, the sun given it’s purpose. </p><p> </p><p>Rio grabs hold of the sheet, uses it to pull Agatha tight against her, locks them in the tangle of bare limbs and hot breath. </p><p> </p><p>“I love you, too.” Agatha finally manages into the hair of space between their mouths, her breath wispy and out of whack, hands that refuse to leave warm skin, a new home in the space between the closet and the small space of wall Rio’s body currently occupied. </p><p> </p><p>It doesn’t feel like some weighted declaration, it feels like letting go of balloons, letting them race towards the clouds, it feels like excitement rumbling somewhere deep inside her soul, a voice asking for truth. </p><p> </p><p>Blue eyes flutter open to find brown ones already looking at her, the light in her irises painting it like a dream, a battle they’d finally stopped trying to fight on opposite sides, a safe admission, a reality they’d ceased pretending for. </p><p> </p><p>“Is your head okay?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio only kisses her again. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha requests that they make no fuss for her birthday, makes Rio promise to not get her a gift, tries her best to convince Rio’s parents that she didn’t want anything special. </p><p> </p><p>The facade lasts into the afternoon, Mrs. Vidal asks Rio to pick up some more flour to make empanadas, and of course Agatha tags along.</p><p> </p><p>She starts to think something’s up when Rio seems in no type of rush, suddenly content to peruse the chip aisle for 10 minutes, finding the ingredient list of Flamin Hot Cheetos increasingly interesting. They pull back into the driveway over an hour later, something charged in the gleam of Rio’s eyes, a cautious turn of her key in the door. </p><p> </p><p>The smell hits Agatha first, a sweet aroma carried over the heat of well used spices. But she’s quickly distracted by the ‘Happy Birthday’ banner hung in the dining room, the balloons bundled in different corners, the sash Rio’s father eases over her, pink and childish, a glittered embellishment of ‘Birthday Princess’. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head and huffs, but can’t fight the cautious smile that takes over her face, the light in blue eyes cascading like a super power. </p><p> </p><p>“I said I didn’t want all this.” She tries to fight back just a little, still needing to maintain her reputation even if these were the people best equipped to see right through the thin attempt at hiding her emotions.</p><p> </p><p>”You’ll change your mind when you see what’s for dinner.” Rio’s mother sing-songs with a gentle smile, satisfied with her own hard work. </p><p> </p><p>The table is already set, each plate given a perfectly plated heap of shrimp Mofongo, a labor of love in peeling green plantains to be fried and then mashed into a savory garlicky mound. And maduros, Agatha’s favorite, a sweet compliment to the salt. It speaks to the way Rio’s mother listened when she spoke, had clearly noted Agatha’s obsession with her cooking, especially anything plantain related. </p><p> </p><p>It isn’t exactly a party, but it surely feels like a celebration. A table with the people who have taken her in, a meal that had clearly been catered to her. They laugh over silly things, an existence that doesn’t feel so heavy, a feeling to remember in the world of changing tides. </p><p> </p><p>Rio cleans the dishes by herself, insisting everyone relax. But Agatha stays close, starts helping to load the dishwasher before Rio can stop her. She swats at her ass playfully, a punishment for not listening, but it doesn’t seem like a negative consequence when Agatha turns around to kiss her, a short touch of lips to stop any verbal protests to Agatha helping out. </p><p> </p><p>Rio and her father pull of a folding table and set it in the living room to play cards, start playing Forest Gump on the TV as background noise, Agatha stays in the kitchen with Mrs. Vidal as she pulls cupcakes out of the oven, letting them cool next to the stove. </p><p> </p><p>At some point after the second game of cards, Mr. Vidal stands up to get another beer, but instead of one, he comes back with three modelos in hand, sliding them in front of Agatha and Rio. </p><p> </p><p>He goes on a small rant about the legal drinking age being 18 in Puerto Rico before handing Rio the bottle opener.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks to her mother trying to gauge if this is some sort of test but she’s busy grinning as she focuses on shuffling the cards, seemingly amused by her husband's antics, she doesn’t question it, simply pops off the cap with ease.</p><p> </p><p>”She’s a natural!” Her father beams with pride and Agatha can’t help the joyed laughter that erupts at the way it took little to make them proud of her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hands Agatha the open bottle, swapping hers out to open the other.</p><p> </p><p>”And a gentleman,” her mother coos.</p><p> </p><p>They cheers before taking a sip, their first alcohol that isn’t communion wine. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha half sputters at the taste, wanting to scrape it from their mouth immediately, watching as Rio goes for another sip, seemingly considering it again, uncertain.</p><p> </p><p>Both parents seem amused by their reactions, her father’s hand coming over Agatha’s shoulder in reassurance.</p><p> </p><p>”Don’t worry, it’ll grow on you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s phone buzzes on the surface of the table as the next round of cards is dealt, ‘Yelena Belova CPS’ lighting up the screen. She rises from her seat, excusing herself quickly to answer the call. Walking towards the stairs, but not going up them, she sits on the third step, enough space to create some privacy, but a sliver of space where she can still see clearly into the living room. Her eyes tracing over Mr. Vidal’s broad shoulders, his wife’s easy smile, the tranquil light in Rio’s eyes. The way they laugh together at something Agatha can’t hear.</p><p> </p><p>”Hello,” Agatha starts, pressing the phone to her ear.</p><p> </p><p>”Hey, kid. How you doing?” Yelena’s accent slips through the line, a serious edge that glides over the way she holds her words, a jarring strain between joking and knowing when to stop. </p><p> </p><p>“Good. I’m good.” Agatha answers after a brief pause, suddenly remembering to answer honestly, that Yelena genuinely wanted to know. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry to bother you so late, there have been some updates with your case if you have a minute.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries to remember the breathing exercises Rio showed her a few weeks ago, tries to harness all her strength, brace herself for whatever truths may form her new reality, quell the flying expectations of what Yelena might be able to share with her.</p><p> </p><p>”Yeah. Okay. I’m ready.” She tries not to choke on her own hesitation, cringing at the meekness of her own voice, she bites her lips to put the pain of it somewhere else. </p><p> </p><p>”The DA won’t be filing formal charges against your mother. They don’t think there’s enough evidence to get a conviction.” Yelena offers, her tone shifting into something controlled, like the words were a practice she’d learned to dull the meanings of, poached the feelings out of in favor of doing her job effectively, a way to compartmentalize through giving solemn news. </p><p> </p><p>It’s a hard pill to swallow, a reality where Evanora faces no consequences, no karma, the pendulum never swinging to knock her off her feet. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs, a shaky breath carrying through the phone.</p><p> </p><p>”But I’m still going to make sure we get the order of protection for you at the very least.” Yelena adds after a moment, qualifies the harsh disappointment with another easier truth, that Agatha would still have some legal protection, that Evanora couldn’t weasel her way back in.</p><p> </p><p>They exchange a few more words, Yelena offering a few more bits of information, when and how the order would go into effect, a blanket of words that morph into legal jargon soup.</p><p> </p><p>”And Agatha,” Yelena offers once more before they can move to end the call, “I believe everything you’ve told me. I know it probably feels invalidating for a bunch of cops to say what you went through is not enough to grant her a just punishment, I’m sorry we couldn’t do more.”</p><p> </p><p>Here, Agatha can hear the emotion in her voice, the soured pleas unanswered, a quiet resolve of anger just beneath the surface, a woman dedicated to a career that was often one step behind, a loss for which they could not make up for.</p><p> </p><p>And sending Evanora to jail would have been nice, but it didn’t stop the sun from coming up tomorrow. It didn’t change the three people that were now her family. </p><p> </p><p>Rio and her parents still sat in the living room, a picture of the life she was cordially invited into. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha voices, a weight that feels more for Yelena than herself, a gratitude for the genuine care, the desire to help even if they hadn’t won. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stays on the stairs for another few minutes after they’ve hung up, she tries to send a mental signal into Rio’s mind to look at her, seeking the reassurance of the person she loves. She watches as Rio gets out of her seat to check on her, the spell suddenly working too well. </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t say anything about the silent tears that trail down Agatha’s cheeks, doesn’t ask if she’s okay. She sits next to her on the third step, their shoulders knocking.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is there, sitting in the spiral of joy and tragedy with her. The truth of their love is not in the lack of hardship, not in the lack of pain, but present and kindling in the way they stay despite it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tangles their arms together, rubs a thumb over Rio’s wrist, drops her head to rest against her. </p><p> </p><p>The pain warps again, slipping towards something more manageable, a heaving breath she can swallow for now. For the first time in a long time, the reality of her life does not feel like a secret to be kept, a wound to cover and carry. It feels like something fragile and beautiful, a garden to tend to, a mind to heal.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps, it was never some God that the world had woven tales about, it was never the guide of an invisible creator. It was the people around her. It was the strength in herself. The will of a girl who had seen Hell and clawed her way out. </p>

<p>Exodus 25:8- They are to make a sanctuary for me, that I may dwell in their midst. </p><p> </p><p>There’s a softness that finds the air after that, an opening to breathe. A truth that wills Agatha to soothe away the tears, to find that anchor of strength over and over until it stops feeling like a bandaid. </p><p> </p><p>She’s ready now, to let the wound breathe, let the scar settle over skin that will never be the same. Because most of the physical wounds from her mother were gone now, little evidence of the storm of her life up until now. Agatha knew Rio saw them still, the scar on the side of her right wrist from a hanger that swung too hard, a red glare that found the light, small but always on display for anyone who knew where to look. The slit hidden just under her left eyebrow, split open from a force Agatha can’t fully remember. She can still feel the ghost of Rio’s fingers holding the wound closed, pressing ice over it, the prayer she whispered into Agatha’s hairline that she didn’t need stitches, that she didn’t have a concussion. </p><p> </p><p>But the emotional scars still bleed even as the physical ones fade. </p><p> </p><p>She knows it will take a long time, that there will still be days that feel like clawing at something she can’t fathom, that pain and grief swim free in the ocean of trying, but the journey didn’t feel as daunting anymore. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been taught to trust in God, to know his strength. So much so that the world forgot to remind her of her own.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio was here now, not to fix her, not to erase a past of tilted skies and gloomy reality, but to remind her of her power, to stay along for the chance at being better. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha likes the odds of better.</p><p> </p><p>This life. The new one she’d hoped for. It cracked open all the old plywood, undid her shackles, made room for peace. </p><p> </p><p>Because healing did not happen in the broad strokes, didn’t come in a swing of changing tides. It pressed against her heart, slow and tentative, hesitant and half-sure. </p><p> </p><p>Healing came in small doses, the smile she finds in the mirror most days, eyes that come back to the light. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows now what to hold onto, Rio’s hand settled against her, the spilling laughter she gets from her father, the choice she made everyday to stay. </p><p> </p><p>They’ll knit it together, a blanket made from stolen kisses and shared clothes, a life she wants to build with rolling eyes and revenant smirks, the warmth of Rio beside her, the safety needed to rest.</p><p> </p><p>She knows there will be time to mourn again later, that the waves of Evanora’s flames have not gone completely yet, that the blistering heat of her mother will take years to wipe away.</p><p> </p><p>But for the moment, she’s done letting Evanora sway her, done letting her ruin things, content to find the love laid out in front of her. </p><p> </p><p>So, she doesn’t tell Rio the news, not yet.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m okay,” Agatha’s voice cracks even at the low volume of her words, her fingers cold and shaking as they curl into Rio’s palm, an answer to a question that Rio hadn’t asked, the quiet trust that Agatha would speak when ready. </p><p> </p><p>Rio rubs her fingers, spreading warmth over her hand, turns just enough to kiss her forehead, as Agatha’s wet laugh fills the space between them, thrown by the contrast of her own attempt at reassurance.</p><p> </p><p>”You can be ‘not okay’ sometimes,” Rio reminds her, gentle but solid. </p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Agatha swallows, her eyes trained on their tangled fingers, the soft movement, shielding herself from the rays of overwhelming love directed at her, “I just- it’s my birthday.”</p><p> </p><p>Brown and blue connect, an ease on Rio’s face. Agatha doesn’t find any worry in the crease of her eyebrows, just unyielding certainty.</p><p> </p><p>”You’ll have a lot of birthdays.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows Rio is giving her permission to cry, feels the quiet reassurance in her bones. But it also trembles beneath the last layer of fear. </p><p> </p><p>Permission to have hope. </p><p> </p><p>A reminder of their youth, of their capacity. </p><p> </p><p>There would be more birthdays.</p><p> </p><p>And still, it didn’t erase the voice in her head, her own voice now, no longer distorted to sound like her mother’s. It reminded her that this wasn’t ruined, that there was still a reason to celebrate. </p><p> </p><p>She pulls out of Rio’s hold reluctantly, like getting out of a warm bed on a freezing day, stands in front of her with her own free will. </p><p> </p><p>“C’mon,” Agatha tugs Rio’s hand, pushing down the static left over from her tears, “Your parents are waiting.”</p><p> </p><p>”Agatha,” Rio stands, even with half a protest on her lips. </p><p> </p><p>But Agatha meets her half way, soothes over the line of hesitation, kisses Rio to make the tranquility tangible. </p><p> </p><p>Rio strokes her cheek, bites the inside of her lip to stop herself from questioning it, content to give Agatha control. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m okay,” Agatha says again, a spark of reassurance that bends stronger this time, not chasing away the eye contact, needing Rio to see it clearly in her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, partly to agree, but mostly to lean closer again, seal it with another short kiss. </p><p> </p><p>They come back into the living room, Agatha pulling Rio behind her. </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Vidal makes a show of staring at their connected hands, before dramatically hiding his cards as if the two girls were trying to look at his hand as they passed. </p><p> </p><p>“Aye, that’s no fair, they’ve created an alliance.” He chirps, making a disgruntled noise as he looks through his cards again. </p><p> </p><p>“And how do we know you didn’t switch the cards while we were gone?” Agatha jokes as they take their seats, Rio beaming at her, Mrs. Vidal hiding her laugh behind her own cards. </p><p> </p><p>“The Vidal way continues I suppose,” He shrugs, offering no context to his comment, even if his wife smiles at it and shakes her head, seemingly understanding. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” Rio’s eyebrows scrunch cutely, looking between her parents for an answer.</p><p> </p><p>”Apparently the Vidal men have been picking strong women to wed for generations.” her mother supplies evenly, clearly not sold on the superstition of it all. </p><p> </p><p>“Strong?” Is the word Agatha seems to focus on, not the part about marriage. </p><p> </p><p>“He’s just proud you don’t take his bullshit,” Rio scoffs, taking a swig of her beer, that sweet dopey smiley coming back. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brain still waits for Rio’s parents to chastise her for cursing, but the admonishment never comes.</p><p> </p><p>”When Rio was about five,” Rio’s father starts as he plays the first card of their new game, nodding his head for his wife to take her turn as he continues “I had a dream where all my ancestors were telling me I needed to have a son. That he would need to carry on the tradition.”</p><p> </p><p>”Did it scare you?” Agatha asks, needing Rio to nudge her to play her card, more invested in the story, even if it was only woven together by his imagination. </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Vidal chuckles, before nodding, hesitant to tell the truth, but still willing. </p><p> </p><p>“I tried to convince them that it would be fine, that Rio loved basketball and drawing Pokémon and that was somehow close enough to being a boy.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs, full and free, unafraid of the consequences, finding a new reason to laugh at Rio’s reaction, a face of startled surprise, her mouth open, letting the words settle over her. </p><p> </p><p>“You told all of our ancestors that I’m gay?” Rio questions, her voice shrill and accusing. </p><p> </p><p>“And they listened.” He answers smugly, proud of himself, “they never haunted me again.”</p><p> </p><p>”The tradition continues, chispita,” Agatha lifts her eyebrows, a mischievous smile filling the space of her smile, trying on Rio’s nickname for added effect. </p><p> </p><p>“Might have to reconsider my choices,” Rio jokes, playing her next card on the table with a bit more force. </p><p> </p><p>“Uh-uh,” Mrs. Vidal argues, “it’s too late, we’re already emotionally attached.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>It takes another two games for Agatha to finish her beer, another silly argument about cheating and three yawns from Rio before they’re calling it quits for the night. </p><p> </p><p>They barely make it up to go to bed before Rio blows her own cover again, doing a terrible job of hiding her dopey grin.</p><p> </p><p>”What did you do?” Agatha asks, partially amused, but trying to come off as annoyed. </p><p> </p><p>“Might have gotten you a gift.” Rio shrugs, unashamed, “Or two”</p><p> </p><p>”Or two?”</p><p> </p><p>”Sit,” Rio nods towards the bed, waiting for the walls of hesitance to dissolve. </p><p> </p><p>“Baby, you promised no gifts.”</p><p> </p><p>”I’m a liar,” Rio admits, “So what? We were already going to hell”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sits, only after hitting her with a pillow.</p><p> </p><p>”Ow,” Rio exaggerates, ripping the pillow from Agatha’s grip and tossing it to the floor, “Is that any way to treat your amazing girlfriend?”</p><p> </p><p>”You’re stalling,” Agatha deadpans, suddenly impatient.</p><p> </p><p>Rio buffers for a second, taking an extra second to process before opening the bottom drawer of her bedside table where she keeps her bras. </p><p> </p><p>“You hid it in your bras?” Agatha chuckles, watching Rio pull out two little boxes.</p><p> </p><p>”Yeah, it's the only clothing of mine you don’t try to steal.”</p><p> </p><p>”Well, your boobs are smaller so it’s not really-</p><p> </p><p>“I do not want to hear any small boob slander in this house.”</p><p> </p><p>”You’re stalling again,” Agatha smiles up at Rio, thinking the hesitance and deflection is cute even if there’s no reason for it, “why are you so nervous?”</p><p> </p><p>”I’m not, I just-“</p><p> </p><p>”What, baby?”</p><p> </p><p>”just want to make you happy”</p><p> </p><p>The radiant clarity in Rio’s eyes makes Agatha want to cry, memorize the delicate perch of her eyebrows, kiss all her breath away, it tilts the world a little further towards healing, the angle shifting closer to dreaming and dulling away the pain. </p><p> </p><p>“You do,” Agatha reaches for her, feeling full as Rio enters her orbit, her palm finding the soft edges of her face, caressing her cheek as Rio sits on the bed next to her, “You make me so happy.” Comes the solid whisper, a taste of her voice without shackles, staring into each other’s eyes until Rio’s forehead thuds into hers. </p><p> </p><p>“Here,” Rio readjusts on the bed, reining in her own emotion, to hand Agatha the smaller of the two boxes, “Open this one first.”</p><p> </p><p>”If this is a ring pop engagement ring, I might have to smother you in your sleep tonight.” Agatha can’t stop her brain from tracking the thought out loud, the lack of filter clear when they’re alone, no fear in voicing the itching thoughts. </p><p> </p><p>But it does a good job in reframing the emotion for now, cataloging them back towards the present. </p><p> </p><p>Rio waits patiently, sits beside her with an open heart, looks at Agatha like she is sure. For a second, Agatha thinks she’s right, that it’s just a piece of candy on the inside with how light the box is, but she opens it to find something else. </p><p> </p><p>A key. Standard, silver. </p><p> </p><p>A key to Rio’s house.</p><p> </p><p>They’re home.</p><p> </p><p>The house she was welcome in, not just as a guest anymore, but as a thoughtful co-habitant, a table with a plate always set for her, a second pillow on their shared bed, her toothbrush in the cup on the sink, a designated place for her shoes.</p><p> </p><p>Family. </p><p> </p><p>Proof in the ridges of metal pressed against Agatha’s fingers. </p><p> </p><p>“I know we're always together, but I figured you needed a way in if you ever decide to actually kill me-“ Rio’s babbling, the nervous energy returning, a fear that perhaps she’d done too much, assumed for Agatha, made a bold choice that could only live in the darkness but never out loud. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha kisses her, partly to shut her up, but also because it feels like a call towards home, settling against Rio’s lips like a quaking sunrise, a desire that claws around her heart to never let go. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha says against her mouth, a prayer. “I love you”</p><p> </p><p>Rio kisses her, a visceral need to tangle her hand into long hair, pull Agatha into her lap, holding her up like a glorious fountain of eternal peace, shivering under the heat. </p><p> </p><p>“I love you too, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sags forward burying her face against Rio’s neck, pressing a soft trail of kisses that doesn't make it far.</p><p> </p><p>”You still have another gift.” Rio chuckles, hoping to stop Agatha’s journey of kisses before she forgets about the second gift altogether. </p><p> </p><p>“Please say it’s you naked.” Agatha mumbles into her skin. </p><p> </p><p>Rio swallows, unable to answer. The hesitation prompts Agatha to pull back swiftly, ready to open the other slightly larger box to get it over with, bring them a step closer towards discarding clothes and muffling moans. </p><p> </p><p>Inside is a small black-</p><p> </p><p>“We don’t have to use it,” Rio qualifies as Agatha looks at the item, sort of confused. Rio’s hands come to hold the box for her, ready to close it and hide it away at the chance of rejection.</p><p> </p><p>A vibrator?</p><p> </p><p>”I just thought you might like it,” The worry in Rio’s forehead peaks into barely there wrinkles, Agatha raising her hand to press away the concern evident in her skin.</p><p> </p><p>“Can I use it on you?” Agatha asks, the sudden urge to see Rio squirm coursing over her, a need to feel her skin.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio seems to choke on the thought, the clear intention for Agatha’s pleasure, but she doesn’t seem put off by it, pleasantly surprised to meet the hunger in blue eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“it’s your birthday,” Rio stalls again, testing the parameters, giving Agatha another chance to be the one under the power of the small toy, before she claims it for herself, even if Agatha already seems sold on the idea of using it on Rio, “I’m supposed to be making you cum.”</p><p> </p><p>”it’s my birthday,” Agatha smirks, finally taking the vibrator out of the box and examining it closer, “And I know exactly what I want.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallows harshly again, her hand skirting up to trace haunting circles over Agatha’s thighs, her eyes casting over with a cloud of heated want, brown irises somehow darken as they fall to Agatha’s lips, in a trance waiting on the whim of every word. </p><p> </p><p>“Can I use it on you?” She repeats.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods weakly, biting her own lip before angling forward to meet Agatha in a kiss, this time coated with languid passion, a story told in each bite and release, a synced cushion of lips and squeezing thighs.</p><p> </p><p>”Does it need to be charged?” Agatha adds into the limited air between them, not wanting to break the embrace, but also wanting to push them forward. </p><p> </p><p>Rio groans slightly, pulling back.</p><p> </p><p>”Needs batteries,” she pries herself away, leaving Agatha on the bed. She watches her amused as Rio strides towards the TV, flipping open the remote and stealing two triple A batteries before flicking off the lights and returning to the bed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallows a comment about Rio’s night light being childish, actually appreciating the mood lighting in a time like this, scanning the planes of Rio’s cheek bones bathed in soft purple. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha is even more turned on as Rio fumbles to twist open the bottom of the toy, her panties easily wrecked by just about anything Rio does with nimble fingers and all the focus of her single brain cell. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snatches it from her hands just as she secures the bottom back on, pressing the power button for the first time, feeling how it vibrates against her fingers.</p><p> </p><p>The dull sound reaches both of their ears like a warning. </p><p> </p><p>Rio surges to her feet once more to turn on the fan, hopefully drowning out the sound of the vibrator along with any moans that might follow.</p><p> </p><p>”C’mere”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha points it at her like a gun, the device still vibrating in her hand, guiding Rio back to her, she runs it over the side of her neck, delicate but testing until it's just above her throat, using it to tip her head back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio melts forward, needing real contact, grabbing onto Agatha’s hips and shifting her back on the bed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns it off for the time being, dropping it onto the sheets to greet the full force of Rio’s body sliding on top of her, feeling the weight of her limbs slot over the ridges of her own, the blistering hunger of hands wandering, Rio’s fingers under her shirt, flexing over her ribs, scratching over her stomach, an ache to be closer, to feel all of her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s shirt comes off first, Rio’s mouth hooking over her left nipple like a magnet, a starved woman who hadn’t been fed in so long, the gasp that leaves her mouth sudden and wide, the precipice of a groan that she pushes down as Rio’s teeth make their presence known.</p><p> </p><p>She kisses over the roundness of her chest, bites over her sternum, her nails scratching down the length of her torso.</p><p> </p><p>”I thought we agreed I was gonna touch you,” Agatha half laughs, half moans as Rio’s mouth continues its war path over her pulse point and throat, claiming every open space with teeth and tongue. </p><p> </p><p>Rio only bites harder, a shaky breath sliding from Agatha’s lips. </p><p> </p><p>“Paciencia, mi amor,” The words carry just into Agatha’s ears, a clamoring of limbs as Agatha’s hands grip harder over Rio’s back, her legs wrapping firmly around Rio, the juts of her hips digging into the soft flesh of Agatha’s inner thighs.</p><p> </p><p>”¿Te gusta cuando te hablo español?” Rio humps into her, a clear smirk on her lips as she grinds forward, the harsh friction of her pelvis bone pushing over Agatha’s clit, a sharp whine finding the air. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” the tilted gasp of want barely finds the space between them, Rio perching up to connect their lips again.</p><p> </p><p>”shhhh” Rio coos against her, “I got you”</p><p> </p><p>The words are enough to spur Agatha into action, will her bones into taking her power back, she flips them with all her strength, the springs of the mattress offering them some reprieve, her thighs straddling Rio’s stomach, Agatha’s hands pulling to lift her shirt, jostling them until it’s pushed above her chest, Agatha content to pull at her nipples and watch Rio buck her hips until she’s begging for more. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Evidently, she doesn’t have to wait that long, Rio tries to keep her voice low, the sliding crack of syllables as she grabs at her girlfriend’s hips, drags Agatha across her stomach from a new angle. </p><p> </p><p>“What happened to patience, baby?” She teases back, a swarm of power casting a spell over them both, the ability to make Rio beg, to make her wait.</p><p> </p><p>Rio has no patience left and Agatha doesn’t complain, inspired to keep moving as she grinds down more, finding the cascading spark of want in brown eyes.</p><p> </p><p>But it isn’t enough, Agatha’s pajama pants hiked up as high as they can go, the seam pressing tightly over her clit, shaking at the concept of more friction, Rio is tired of bunching them up, bucking up into her and seeking the same form of contact.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands press down the hem of the pants, struggling to remove them without getting off, she moves up onto her knees, laughing menacingly as Rio’s hands wordlessly join hers to help.</p><p> </p><p>When they can’t get them down more than an inch or two, Rio’s hand buries itself inside instead, her fingers gliding from her entrance and back out, a tease of pressure that feels like a reason to get on her knees and cry for more. </p><p> </p><p>And they seem to be on the same page, the awkward angle of Rio’s fingers, the growing need to touch, the offending sweat under the pajama bottoms, the pooling heat in her underwear that needed to be set free. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha clambers off of her, forcing the hem of her pants down to her ankles as soon as she’s firmly standing, but Rio doesn’t stay on the bed, following after her to grab at her hips, push down Agatha’s panties a moment after, make sure they don’t run into any other clothing related obstacles.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha’s hands seem to agree, pulling Rio closer by the fabric of her boxers, the other hand delving under the material to sample the wet heat between her legs, feel the way her fingers scratch lightly over thick hair before drowning in the warmth, the arousal coating the tips of three fingers easily, the soft gush of want never failing to surprise her. The weight of her hands, the way Rio came undone just for her.</p><p> </p><p>She can feel Rio twitch against her fingers as their lips meet once more, Rio’s fingers wrapping around her wrist, keeping her in place. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha isn’t exactly setting a pace, just sliding through the wetness with ease, exploring each touch and Rio’s reaction, a gasp into her mouth, a bite to her lip.</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans a few seconds later as Agatha removes her hand, an actual pout on her lips, an attempt at puppy dog eyes, extremely pathetic.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha giggles, tilting Rio’s head down by her jaw to kiss her nose, before using both hands to pull down her boxers, scratching purposely over her hips.</p><p> </p><p>”Sit,” Agatha directs, pushing her backwards, strong enough to move her, but allowing time for Rio to catch herself on her own feet, sitting on the edge of the bed, her hands braced on the sheets as she waits for Agatha’s next move. “Good girl”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stands between her legs, peering down at her, one hand in Rio’s hair, the other held around her throat, tilting her head back to force eye contact. Testing the pressure on her neck, she waits for the fear to bloom in brown eyes, but it never comes, instead filling with the sweeping crush of sordid desire, the falling leaves of petulant trust. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her like a statue made of stone, carved and doted over by the most talented of sculptors, an heirloom, an artifact, a painting to swoon over, to see the way it catches the light over and over, find the flaws of uneven brush strokes and still marvel at its making. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her like she is a God, a reason to fall to her knees, the place to revisit in her times of need, when faith is all she has, when the rest of the world feels too heavy, Agatha is her solace, Agatha is her safety. </p><p> </p><p>it isn’t a secret anymore, no longer buried in the cold ink of Rio’s hidden poems, no longer bleached and rung out for the sanitized lens of the rest of the world. </p><p> </p><p>The truth is plain now, a lullaby sang in the hitch of Rio’s breath, a painting hung in the swirl of love in Rio’s eyes. A display, a beautiful portrait of the dreams that may come, and the ones already blooming. </p><p> </p><p>They cling to each other, Agatha climbing into her lap, anchoring into Rio’s strong arms, letting her keep her upright, the surge of muscles draining as Agatha’s tongue fits over her collarbone, her fingernails digging into her scalp, still Rio’s fingers flex over her ass, squeeze and scratch over practiced goosebumps. </p><p> </p><p>After the third readjusting of Rio’s grip, she grows impatient with the way her fingers loosen, give way to the chance of Agatha escaping her grasp, so she stands, lifting Agatha with her, swallowing the surprised yelp that comes out of her mouth from the sudden movement.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lays Agatha back on the bed, gently but ready to grab at any and all flesh, squeezing her calves, kissing her hip. </p><p> </p><p>“Come back,” an echo of a needy whine, all pretenses of patience falling away, Agatha grabbing childishly at Rio’s shoulders, “I’m cold.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifts backwards, pulling Rio by the arm with her, she sits with her back against the head board.</p><p> </p><p>”Where do you want me?” Rio asks, giving Agatha full command, the timber of her voice serious and committed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha directs her easily, positioning Rio to sit in front of her between her legs, Rio’s back pressed into Agatha’s chest.</p><p> </p><p>The initial feeling is the rub of Rio’s shoulder blades firm against her chest, the spark of hardened nipples almost too overwhelmed at the constant contact, but the intensity of Rio’s warmth is even more pronounced, her skin buzzing at every inch of connection.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s arms hook under Rio’s, the palms of her hands, easily grazing over her rib cage, down over her belly button and back where they belong to find Rio even wetter than a few minutes ago, she pulls Rio closer, kissing along her neck and down her shoulder as she rubs over her chest, hearing the sighs and stunted mewls that shake from Rio’s throat, the amount of skin contact, the ability to feel her pulse, to hear the vibration of the noises originated from Agatha’s fingers and lips, it spiraled towards the place in Agatha’s brain that sang of belonging, of offering something significant, returning the favor.</p><p> </p><p>Making Rio happy too.</p><p> </p><p>Because she couldn’t just see it. She could feel it.</p><p> </p><p>In the way Rio grabbed at her wrists, squirmed under the passionate attention, ached for more at every pinch or kiss. The want felt tangible here, a truth she’s fully wrapping her mind around finally. </p><p> </p><p>“Did you lock the door?” Agatha whispers against the back of her ear just as her fingers brush against her clit again.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio arches forward, her back moving to clear some space between them for half a second, before the contact returns, a shuttering moan coming from both of them, “No. It’s open.” She admits.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabs onto Agatha’s wrist, not wanting her to pull away yet, needing another moment of contact even if she knows she’ll inevitably have to break it. </p><p> </p><p>“Baby,” Agatha chimes again, the smile evident on her lips, as they press against her neck, amused at the way Rio’s fingers flex, a need cascading over her logic, “Go lock the door.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio squirms like Agatha is saying something filthy, the primal twist in her gut forcing her hand, the slick sound of Agatha’s fingers moving against her never ceasing even with the new command, a decision Agatha is forcing her to make, a blissful realm of torture. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio breathes out but still doesn’t move, arches again into Agatha’s fingers, before shaking her head, using extra effort to break her mind out of its loaded pleasure, stilling Agatha’s hand with her grip and removing it from her center.</p><p> </p><p>Rio climbs off the bed in a wave, a careless peak that soars across the room just long enough to reach the door and turn the lock, giving Agatha just enough time to reach for the vibrator she’d previously dropped onto the bed.</p><p> </p><p>The return is just as graceless, a deep scampering back towards her to take her rightful thrown back between Agatha’s legs, she crawls up to her kissing her soundly, a reminder to stay quiet, a cautious second of reining it all in again. </p><p> </p><p>Rio returns to her previous position, her back pressing into Agatha’s chest, the warmth of her body feeling even more sharp now, Agatha rubs at her upper thighs making sure she’s comfortable, turning the vibrator back on, she drags it across Rio’s skin right under her belly button, not wanting to startle her. </p><p> </p><p>The soft buzz still makes Rio jump, no verbal warning for the new sensation.</p><p> </p><p>“Will you tell me if you want me to stop?” Agatha murmurs against her shoulder blade, trying to angle Rio back enough to catch a glimpse of brown eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, swallows harshly, claws at Agatha’s thighs, bracing herself, finding a place to hold onto as she tries to stay calm, “Yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kisses along her shoulder, bites over soft skin as she moves the toy down, craning her neck to watch as it finally makes contact with Rio’s pussy, a ghost of touch that simmers against her lips, coating the silicone with Rio’s wetness as she drags it down still feather light.</p><p> </p><p>She smiles in awe at the way her body reacts, the sharp inhale from barely any contact, the way Rio’s fingers bruise into her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>“Breathe, baby” Agatha reminds her, as she drag it back up to her clit, starting a path of up and down movement, long strokes to bump over each sensitive spot, but offer no true relief, she stalls half a second about half way down, waits to feel Rio’s firm exhale against her own ribs before setting a more intentional pace. </p><p> </p><p>Rio licks her lips, seems to anchor herself further against Agatha’s body, a tensing of her muscles as the quiet moans begin to mix in with the peak of each shattered breath, Agatha can feel each tilted motion, the hold on one of her hips sliding up to pull at one of her nipples, rubbing idly to match the same pace of the vibrator.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha experiments further, starting to trace small circles against her, pressing in a little more firmly, filing it as a successful move when Rio sags forward, bites her own lip. Agatha righting her posture after a moment, laying back slightly to let Rio rest more of her weight against her. </p><p> </p><p>The angle changes then, the pressure shooting through Rio’s legs as she shakes against Agatha, squeezes her thighs together.</p><p> </p><p>”Is it too much, baby?” Agatha asks, a wrecked edge to her own voice, watching as Rio shakes her head instantly, frantic, desperate for Agatha to keep going. </p><p> </p><p>But the shattered moan still comes out of Rio’s mouth, a sigh she almost chokes on.</p><p> </p><p>The quick solve is to grab Agatha’s hand off her chest, Rio using Agatha’s palm to press over her lips, forcing her mouth closed, humming solidly into the harsh press of it. Agatha easily commits to the new job, kissing the side of Rio’s face as best as she can reach, barely finding the glint of brown eyes in the dark, watching as Rio tries to control herself, dazed at the power of her own hands, mesmerized by the buzz of the vibrator as it moves against her, the shine it reflects in the light, the way her brain doesn’t allow the movement to falter even as her own hand begins to ache. </p><p> </p><p>She holds tight over Rio’s mouth, caught in the bucking of her hips, the strong gusts of breath shocking into her fingers, entranced by every sigh, every arch, still learning how to undo her but relishing in every chance to practice. </p><p> </p><p>“Can you cover your mouth for me?” Agatha seeks confirmation, needing to make sure Rio was still aware enough to respond before removing her hand from her mouth, suddenly overcome with a new want, a new place begging for her fingers. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods around another stunned moan, allows Agatha to remove her palm from her face before covering her mouth with her own, the firm press even tighter, not trusting herself with any leeway.</p><p> </p><p>”So pretty,” Agatha muses against her, pressing a kiss to any skin she can reach. She sits them up slightly, making sure her now free hand can find its new destination.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers come to rest just below the vibrators path, spreading Rio open further, her huffed groan still finding clarity passed the secure grip of her fingers, barely touching and already setting her on fire.</p><p> </p><p>The amount of wetness is still startling, a puddle that makes her feel unbelievably soft, a fountain Agatha could play in for hours.</p><p> </p><p>When she sinks a finger inside her, Agatha thinks Rio might break, the moment broken and taped back together as Rio’s knees bend further, bracing against the bed, pressing further back into Agatha as her hips move up to meet her at the first knuckle, unable to contain her want even if her body and mouth were trying to stay in control.</p><p> </p><p>And it sort of breaks Agatha’s heart, wanting to hear each crack of Rio’s resolve as she slowly combusts second by second, wanted the full peak of every moan against her ears, needed to know the full scope of her power.</p><p> </p><p>But, this was enough.</p><p> </p><p>The press of each shutter, the goosebumps on her thighs, the shake in her legs every time the vibrator traced to the left. </p><p> </p><p>And the feel of Rio clenching over two of her fingers now, that indescribable heat drowning her as they press in and out, soft and eager. Enough, just enough.</p><p> </p><p>Rio cums with a soft cry, her hand still clenched over her mouth, Agatha watching in amazement as her body swings up, her back straight, her head lulling forward, her left leg shaking with a static shiver.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha holds her through it, keeping her in place, stunned out of her own dazed concentration by Rio’s free hand knocking the vibrator away, her brows scrunching as she struggles to catch her breath, suddenly overstimulated. Agatha waits to remove her fingers, patient to find a halted breath that doesn’t sweep as intensely to start pulling out. </p><p> </p><p>Rio murmurs an incomprehensible sound in protest, turning slightly into her, tucking herself closer somehow, her limbs turning to jelly. Agatha kisses her forehead, feeling the sweat on her skin cool against her lips, turning the vibrator off and letting it rest on the side of the bed. </p><p> </p><p>“You alive in there?” Agatha tickles the tip of her nose against Rio’s cheek when her breathing evens out but dark eyes remain closed. </p><p> </p><p>“mmm” Rio doesn’t stir, content to use Agatha as a pillow for the rest of the night.</p><p> </p><p>A soft laugh leaves Agatha’s lips, pleasantly amused at the lack of energy. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s fingernails bite into her hip as punishment, grumbling as she turns, settling on her side, the perfect ball for Agatha to cocoon around.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls up the blankets, covering them both with a little extra effort. Overextending her arm is worth it to keep them warm, worth the gentle exhale that leaves Rio’s slightly parted lips, the ease of her limp arms wrapped around her waist, their knees slotted over each other. </p><p> </p><p>“Happy birthday to me,” she whispers into Rio’s hair, her arms snug around her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Job 34:4- Let us choose what is right; let us determine among ourselves what is good.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you stop looking at me like that?” Agatha seethes from the driver's seat, obviously trying to focus.</p><p> </p><p>August doesn’t offer any relief when it comes to heat, an infuriating burn of sunlight through barely tinted windows, the pressure harsh against her forearms as she holds tight to the steering wheel. The impending sweat is not making it better.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s car smells like men’s cologne and it doesn’t help the nausea building in her stomach, the uncomfortable sticking of her thighs to the seat.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m hopelessly in love with you, let me stare.” Rio argues, a smile on her face that Agatha doesn’t need to see to recognize. It’s calm and predictable, a fight they have over and over, but still somehow amusing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes all the same, heaves a heavy sigh.</p><p> </p><p>”You’re distracting me”</p><p> </p><p>The comment is fair. For the past few weeks Rio’s been teaching Agatha how to drive, a slow journey from empty parking lots to back roads to main highways. It was another step towards freedom, towards independence, towards not feeling like a child that needed taking care of. Something immensely powerful in operating heavy machinery, her own will to move a two ton hunk of metal. A learning curve, especially now trying to master parallel parking- or at least get good enough to do it once for her road test and then hopefully never again. </p><p> </p><p>And Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Rio and her big brown eyes and those lips that tilt into ravishing smirks, a yearning in her face even now. Rio who was patient with each mistake, who explained each motion like she had all the time in the world to help Agatha understand, Rio who wasn’t above using sex as a reward. </p><p> </p><p>It wouldn’t be the first time a look turned dangerous, Agatha would smoothly hit the brakes or complete a perfect three-point turn, and Rio would pile on the positive reinforcement, slide into the backseat and wait for Agatha to join her, go down on her in her sad old sedan, Agatha’s ass pressed into the peeling leather, her hands in Rio’s hair. </p><p> </p><p>And usually Agatha is the last to complain about an impromptu orgasm, but she was really trying to focus and the threat of Rio’s hands and mouth on her skin wasn’t helping. </p><p> </p><p>“Your road test isn’t until next month,” Rio shrugs, trying to take off some of the pressure, the remnants of a need to strive for perfection under Evanora’s guide. It wasn’t like they were running out of time, Rio was more than happy to drive them to campus everyday until Agatha got her license, then they could share the responsibility. “We have time.”</p><p> </p><p>‘We’ still hits the air just right, a thundering clap of including her in all of their plans. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand settles on Agatha’s thigh, shaking her slightly when no response comes.</p><p> </p><p>”You okay, baby?”</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha’s noticed that too. Rio checking in without fear that she’ll bolt, verbally marking the chance for Agatha to find her words, practice the safety of expressing her feelings without the walls shooting up. Because Rio is still so gentle, a tenderness that runs deep in her soul, an empathy that finds balance against her own strong will, her own pain, but now there is comfort, an ease in the way they’ve settled into this new normal, Agatha isn’t surprised by the warmth anymore, no longer afraid that the heat will recede. </p><p> </p><p>Because Rio’s love has never felt conditional, a firm hand that never wavers, eyes that only seek to be met with the same degree of care, so Agatha showed her cards now, wasn’t withholding her sharp edges to protect herself or their relationship. </p><p> </p><p><em>You’re not a monster.</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio had murmured it into her forehead enough times like a balm over open wounds. So she let out the anger, the pain, a means of never having to swallow the ugly parts alone. Because Rio knew it was just who Agatha was, someone who taunted and teased and pinched and prodded as a way of showing her love, a truth in the way effort bolted loose from every thorn.</p><p> </p><p>”Yeah, processing.”</p><p> </p><p>And maybe that was new too, being honest about the things she’d yet to understand. Because the quick witted jabs, the voice of broken observation didn’t need to exist in every moment. A place to exist that felt like a pause on weeding the garden of her mind, where the hard job of untangling Agatha’s roots from Evanora’s wires could yield for a breath or two. </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps that’s the lesson to be learned, that healing would take time, that memories of her mother would shrink and shatter the more she tended to the life she was forming now. That this was not an ending to some fairytale, that the book would continue, a saga of learning and unlearning, a binding contract of Rio’s hands on her, always finding brown eyes across the kitchen, pulling her closer by her oversized t-shirt. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha attempts to parallel park three more times. A lost cause for the time being. But she doesn’t let the frustration mount, presses away the anger at herself, the swarming desire to make all her problems about the way she couldn’t turn the steering wheel at the exact right time. That in itself feels like something to be proud of. </p><p> </p><p>Rio still kisses her across the center console, grabs at her like she’s perfection. </p><p> </p><p>Kisses that still feel like the stuff of dreams, a love worthy of Gods. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Sirach 24:28- The first human being never finished comprehending wisdom, nor will the last succeed in fathoming her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was getting used to winters in the city, the stuttering blaze of wind wrapping around pedestrians and cars and tall buildings, the way sidewalks remained crowded, only now the people walking were shielding themselves from the cold with scarves and gloves and knit hats. </p><p> </p><p>It was hard to remember the last time she’d seen this much ice, maybe it was their first Christmas break in college, a day they’d spent making snowmen with Alice and Jen. Now the freezing temperatures offered no time for the previous fall to melt, coating the ground with a fresh layer. Her bones ache as the wind seems harsher than usual, burying her nose and lips into the front of her coat as she walks briskly, yet carefully, a maze through barely moving crowds.</p><p> </p><p>She thinks of the last time she was truly warm, the snap shot of this morning clear in her head, Rio has to admit to herself that she should have listened to Agatha when they were still in bed, that Rio should call out of work, just this once, should stay tucked underneath her girlfriend in the safe warmth. But for all her brains, the ones that were supposedly fully developed now at the age of 25, Rio was still stubborn (and had one-sided beef with every meteorologist that presided over the city). </p><p> </p><p>So instead of keeping their cocoon intact, Rio had used all her willpower to pry herself out of Agatha’s grasp, littering her face and neck with kisses as she went, and got ready for work, leaving Agatha to find a new source of heat. And of course, Rio had a heart, doing her best to get Agatha to stop pouting, replacing her spot with Rio’s favorite childhood teddy bear, a strange looking skeleton bear whose fur was matted and turning green. Rio’s father had found it in the attic the day they moved out, and even after 2 attempts at deep cleaning him, he still looked sickly and worse for wear. Still Agatha grabbed him from Rio violently, a small show of her dramatics, she still accepts Rio’s kiss goodbye and reminds her to be careful.</p><p> </p><p>Right now, Rio wants nothing more than to return to Agatha, not only to bring feeling back to her fingers, but also because an 8 hour shift is long enough to miss her. She can’t exactly complain about work either, an administrative assistant at a vet’s office, she basically spends all day greeting people’s cute pets in between paper work. It’s not super stressful, and pays pretty well. But any time away from Agatha only makes the heart grow fonder, the day apart enough to bring an ounce of their high school yearning back. </p><p> </p><p>Okay, only 6 more blocks. </p><p> </p><p>The thought is broken by the vibration of her phone against the hand nestled beside it inside her pocket, she scrambles to take it out, thinking perhaps Agatha is calling to check her whereabouts even if Rio is already sharing her location, but instead the screen is lit up with an old picture of her mother, a snapchat filter on her face to make her look like a piece of broccoli, a picture that had been lovingly transferred from old phone to new phone over the last 10 years. She quickly scrambles to free her thumb from the inside of her gloves, braving the cold for just a moment to be able to accept the call, before correcting the fabric and pressing the phone to her ear. </p><p> </p><p>“Hi, Mami,” Rio offers instinctively, wincing as the cold surface of her phone presses against the shell of her ear. </p><p> </p><p>“Aye, Chispita, are you out in this weather?” Her mother scolds her immediately, somehow knowing exactly what Rio was doing. The Vidals were still the same loving and accepting goofballs, but perhaps moving away from them had made her mother a bit more overbearing, a tick closer towards over-protective.</p><p> </p><p>”Is it snowing there too?” </p><p> </p><p>“No, but I always check the city too, I need to make sure mi niña is safe.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, not only because her mother casually stalks her zip code on the weather app, but also because Rio knows her mother is talking about Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“She’s fine, Mami, she stayed home from work today.” Rio supplies easily, trying to keep an even pace, staying flat footed, while still listening to her mother’s voice. </p><p> </p><p>“They closed the library today?” Her mother asks, clarifying that Agatha’s place of employment wasn’t open, as if she’d be popping in to visit her daughter-in-law anytime soon. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, it’s been pretty bad all day, it’s probably gonna be closed tomorrow too.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s brain tries not to think of Librarian Agatha with her mother on the phone, but she still thinks of bright blue eyes and her wide framed glasses, a pencil skirt ridden up over pale thighs hanging over her desk. She tries not to think about how Agatha had only gotten hotter in the last 10 years, couldn’t wait to watch her age like fine wine, knowing full well who she belonged to. She shakes her head, focusing back into the conversation, trying to kill her metaphorical boner. </p><p> </p><p>“Your father is asking when you plan on popping the question,” Rio can hear his voice somewhere in the background, using his wife as the mouth piece for his nagging, like this is a new question, like Rio needs to be reminded of the prize in her bed. </p><p> </p><p>“Why do you assume I’m the one that has to propose?” Rio counters the same every time.</p><p> </p><p>She can hear the amused breath her mother takes on the other end, pleased to be the middle man in their little game. </p><p> </p><p>“Sooner rather than later,” Rio clarifies, “if I don’t freeze to death first.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re less than 2 blocks away, you’ll make it.” Her mother’s voice teases.</p><p> </p><p>”Are you watching my location right now?” Rio smiles despite the circumstance, happy to share the information that she’s only ever really home or at work if it makes her mother feel more relaxed.</p><p> </p><p>”Love you. Tell Agatha we said hi,” is the only answer she gets before the call ends abruptly. She stuffs her phone back in her pocket and pulls her hood tighter around her ears, willing herself to make it home without incident. </p><p> </p><p>When she finally makes it inside their apartment building, Rio has never been more grateful for a heating system that actually works, the elevator doors shutting her into the space alone, the quiet is welcome as the tips of her ears begin to thaw. Still, there’s the buzz in her heart that’s never gone away, the jitter in her chest that presses in before she gets to see Agatha again. She knows it’s cheesy, knows she’s a sap, but its the swirl of butterflies that she still writes poetry about, the wistful smile that marks every moment spent with the person she’s loved since she was 14. </p><p> </p><p>Their apartment is made up of tiny memories, the first place that Agatha could make feel like her own. She’d given Agatha first dibs on picking curtains and the couch, but each item truly breathed into their identities. The book shelf that was overwhelmingly full, the coffee table that was a housewarming gift from Alice, their shoes on a metal rack by the door. Agatha collected salt and pepper shakers that were different shapes, a set for every holiday. The little Christmas tree that was still up in the corner even towards the end of January. There were paintings on the walls, signed in the corner R. Vidal. Agatha’s favorite coffee mug- a large black mug that read ‘Fill me up daddy’ in fancy swirling font. A desk in a random corner filled with both of their hobbies, Rio’s markers shoved halfway back into boxes, dried paint on haphazard palettes, Agatha’s side neater, with papers and glittery pens. The sight of the practiced chaos never fails to fill her with warmth. </p><p> </p><p>Rio kicks off her shoes at the door, a hushed breath as the smell of soup fills the air and the sight of Agatha at the stove, mixing a pot with a wooden spoon.</p><p> </p><p>Rio can’t help but smile as Agatha turns to meet her gaze, beaming at the way her body commands her forward, a need to be close.</p><p> </p><p>”Hi,” Agatha whispers, any other words stopped abruptly by Rio’s mouth, pressing a firm kiss to her lips.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands come up to unzip Rio’s coat, her hands snaking inside the fabric to press over her chest, rub against the soft material of the sweater hidden underneath, pulling her body against her, Rio sighing at the proximity, giggling at the fact that her gloves hadn’t even come off, that all she could think about was Agatha as soon as she’d laid eyes on her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s posture shrinks into Agatha, burying her face into the crook of her neck, but a squeal follows as Agatha jerks away.</p><p> </p><p>”Your nose is freezing,” Agatha chirps, her hand raising to rub at the tip of Rio’s nose, coaxing away the cold. Rio allowing it for a moment, before ducking to settle her lips against Agatha’s palm.</p><p> </p><p>”It’s really cold outside,” Rio mumbles into her skin.</p><p> </p><p>”Mmm, funny,” Agatha rolls her eyes, “Almost like I warned you of just that this morning.”</p><p> </p><p>”I don’t recall.” Rio’s eyes narrow, but she doesn’t pull away, playfully gnawing at Agatha’s thumb. </p><p> </p><p>It’s then that a noise sounds from somewhere in the apartment, it isn’t exactly loud or alarming, simply a dull shuffling, movement from their bedroom, just enough to grab Rio’s attention. </p><p> </p><p>Her teeth take a break from munching on Agatha’s finger to speak.</p><p> </p><p>”What was that?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t exactly look guilty, something maniacal in her smirk, her eyes lighting up minutely as she tries to bat her eyelashes, posing as demure and unassuming. Rio should be used to this by now, the wicked tells of Agatha and the way she’d bloomed over the years. But it still makes Rio’s heart beat faster, knowing that Agatha feels comfortable to be herself now, to tease and cook up pranks and make questionable plans, to stir up fake fights, knowing Rio would never raise her voice at her, never touch her in a way she didn’t want. </p><p> </p><p>“Sooo, there’s good news, and there’s bad news.” Agatha’s hands rake over Rio’s shoulders, pulling off her coat, her gloves swept into the sleeves. The tactile distraction is matched by the seductive movement of her lips, almost enough to drown the memory of the sound completely away.</p><p> </p><p>Fuck, Rio was still wrecked for her. </p><p> </p><p>But the shuffling noise comes back, the perfect timing to rip Rio out of her reverie. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha” she warns, her eyebrows tilting up, waiting for the rest of the explanation, as she lets Agatha step away with her coat, hanging it on the back of a chair.</p><p> </p><p>She grabs Rio’s hand, pulling her forward towards their bedroom, rubbing against her skin as they move the short distance through the apartment, still putting in effort to warm her up. </p><p> </p><p>“The bad news is we have an unexpected expense,” Agatha starts again as they enter the room, turning to reveal a crate in the corner of the room, “The good news is you're the father.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes settle on a small ball of white and light brown fur happily sniffing around the inside of the crate, a small pile of cabbage and carrot pieces left neatly beside the creature, a thin layer of cushion underneath. </p><p> </p><p>“Is that a bunny?” Rio slowly approaches, not trying to startle the animal but wanting a better look, “Where did you-“</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opens the latch and swings it open, letting Rio get closer. </p><p> </p><p>“I found him outside, shivering.” Agatha says evenly, perhaps trying to convince Rio that they needed to keep him. “I went to get groceries and he was hiding under a truck on the street, I gave him a carrot, and he jumped right into my arms.”</p><p> </p><p>”You stole him off the street, got it.” Rio deadpans, her voice betraying her actions as her knees meet the carpet, her hand reaching towards the rabbit, letting him smell her hand before trying to pet him softly. </p><p> </p><p>“I saved him from the street, yes.”</p><p> </p><p>”What were you doing in the city, little guy?” Rio asks the bunny, stroking the top of his head gently, as he chatters his teeth at her, something close to purring, her voice soft and expectant, like he could recount the tales of his urban adventure.</p><p> </p><p>“And then what?” Rio turns her head to look at Agatha, staying put on the floor, “You immediately went to the pet store for a crate and rabbit food?”</p><p> </p><p>”You know me so well, baby.” Agatha smiles at her, and it isn’t the smile of concocted plans, it’s something bright and simple, the way her eyes crinkle, her dimples creasing perfectly, a look Rio knows means she’s toast, that they both already know that Rio will agree to keeping their new pet. </p><p> </p><p>Rio bites back her own smile, not wanting to concede so easily, she sighs, looking back at him, still happily accepting Rio’s attention. </p><p> </p><p>“He really likes you.” Agatha mumbles as she settles on the floor next to Rio, pressing her luck now in her convincing attempt.</p><p> </p><p>”Does he have a name?”</p><p> </p><p>”Scratchy,” Agatha answers as she looks at the bunny lovingly.</p><p> </p><p>”Why Scratchy?” Rio asks, soft and curious. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls one of her sleeves up to reveal her forearm, showing several red lines scratched into her skin. </p><p> </p><p>“He didn’t mean it.” Agatha explains before Rio can even ask, “I was holding him when I pulled out the cabbage and he got excited.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leans forward to press kisses over the lines.</p><p> </p><p>“Did he apologize?” Rio asks half seriously.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles at her, rolls her eyes at the goofy question.</p><p> </p><p>”What?” Rio defends, “I have to make sure you’re raising my son right.”</p><p> </p><p>”Your son, hmm?” Agatha pulls Rio up by the collar of her sweater, their faces close suddenly, Agatha’s hot breath against her face.</p><p> </p><p>”Who am I to argue with a paternity test?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kisses her, maybe partially to shut her up, but Rio could never be mad at a kiss, not when every single one still set her on fire, not when she’d agree to a pet dragon if that’s what Agatha had asked. </p><p> </p><p>Rio gets to her fatherly duties a few minutes later (when Agatha remembers the pot of soup simmering on the stove), installing the water bottle Agatha had purchased onto the side of the crate, finding a softer blanket to line the bottom, making sure Scratchy was warm and happy in his new home. </p><p> </p><p>She spends the next 20 minutes curled on the floor with him, letting him explore the room and sniff around, before he cuddles against her hand, asking for more pets.</p><p> </p><p>”How’s it going in here?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at Agatha upside down, standing in the door frame, a sweet smile on her lips as she watches the two on the floor.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m surprised he’s so calm.” Rio starts, “They usually take a while to be comfortable in a new place.” </p><p> </p><p>Scratchy scampers towards Agatha upon noticing her presence, sniffing at her sock covered feet. </p><p> </p><p>“He’s a special little guy.” Agatha bends down to pick him up.</p><p> </p><p>”How do you know he’s a boy?” Rio asks, just thinking to ask now, Agatha had been quite certain about it earlier. </p><p> </p><p>“Lilia checked.” Agatha shrugs like it's no big deal.</p><p> </p><p>”Lilia was here?”</p><p> </p><p>”Yeah,” Agatha laughs, “She was very adamant that he needed to be blessed.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns.</p><p> </p><p>”I missed my boy’s baptism?”</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>After dinner is eaten and the leftovers are packed away, the evening takes shape in a way that isn’t anything new, but the tangle of laughter and the softness on both their faces springs free like it has no reason to hide, like a something as beautiful as the first time. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha settles on the couch first, turning the TV on in a hopeless attempt to find something she’d actually want to watch, flipping through the true crime podcasts she’d already played over several times, skipping past the nature documentaries recommended from Rio never signing out of her YouTube account.</p><p> </p><p>It isn’t long before Rio is sitting down next to her, two glasses of wine dropped onto the coffee table, a chance to sip them idly after a long day, the warmth of a slight buzz maybe a necessary addition, but still the emptiness of their hands, a chance to touch, to come back to the solidity of each other. </p><p> </p><p>Rio wastes no time, curling into Agatha, reaching her arm over her stomach, settling a soft hand over her hip, rubbing over the soft material of her shirt, kissing her shoulder without hesitating, a freedom that never gets old.</p><p> </p><p>She will never forget the pure joy in Agatha’s face the day they came to look at the apartment, rent was cheap and the paint wasn’t chipping and Agatha lost her breath at the view, truthfully nothing special, just the sight of other buildings, the bustle of people below. It reminded her of how sheltered they were, how much there was to grasp and learn now at their fingertips, Rio made is her mission to help Agatha dip her toes into the newness of their freedom, to never let her drown alone amongst the overwhelming slant of truth that her mother had hidden her from. </p><p> </p><p>She’ll never forget the simple ease of being on their own, the way college years had morphed into young adulthood, the quiet insecurity of growing up and not knowing the direction. The harsh trepidation when Rio asked Agatha if she’d be crazy to change her major followed by a level of comfort and reassurance Agatha had surprised even herself with. The nights where Evanora’s callous grip reared it’s ugly head, holding Agatha through nightmares, celebrating each year Agatha stayed in therapy, each year Rio stayed on her meds. </p><p> </p><p>And even still was the freedom to touch, pushing each other backward into every opening of free wall space, kissing into mouths hungrily, covering every surface with their body heat, marking each spot off like a list, lifting Agatha onto every inch of countertop, on the coffee table, against the cool tile of the shower, leaving marks on Rio’s chest, across Agatha’s thighs, not caring about pushing down pleading moans, begging out loud without a need to stay quiet. </p><p> </p><p>A glory that persists even now, as Rio settles her mouth against Agatha’s collarbone, not pulling back from the tether of fate, drowning in the smell of her, unable to stop as Agatha’s hands tangle in her hair, scratch sharply at her scalp, the blunt scrap of her nails only prompts Rio to bite, an open gasp falling from Agatha’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>”I missed you,” Rio mumbles against her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leans back, biting her own lip as she caresses the side of Rio’s face, holding her steady for their eyes to meet for a quiet moment.</p><p> </p><p>”So pathetic,” Agatha smiles in her face, wicked and mean, quickly giving way to another surging gasp, the bucking of her hips as Rio digs her nails into her hip, grazing down the top of her thigh. </p><p> </p><p>“You wanna try that again, baby?” </p><p> </p><p>Ah, being smug never gets old. Knowing Agatha was still just as affected by her, almost 10 years from the first time they’d kissed on Rio’s balcony. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head, brushing their noses together on the last motion, whispering “shut up” as she pulls Rio’s mouth back to her. </p><p> </p><p>It was still dizzying and electric, a pull to stay in this blistering heat, to let it consume her whole. Something in the way that there was no rush now, no fear that time was knocking, that there were sacred firsts to uncover with a looming deadline.</p><p> </p><p>Rio could take her time, lay her back, kiss Agatha’s lips, neck, trace her fingers over every angled plane of her body, memorize for the hundredth time, the exact fraction that Agatha’s breath hitched, the tilted sighed that pressed back against her mouth, the needy pull of hands in her hair, nails scraping against her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>And she still couldn’t believe she got to be the one to witness every perfect gleam of the woman underneath her, that she was trusted to love her, to take care of her, to find the will to be good enough for the strongest person she’d ever know. A soaring reprieve of a child who had learned to use her own voice, to take back her own power, to be exceedingly beautiful in her humanity. It had never once stopped feeling like she was a commoner blessed with the chance to serve the queen, like she could never forget just how tenderly Agatha returned the worship, a welcome edge to the way she expressed her love, something distinctly Agatha to their push and pull, a sweet kiss with gnawing teeth. </p><p> </p><p>It’s only a few minutes of slow making out later that the thought abruptly enters Rio’s mind. </p><p> </p><p>”Do you think Scratchy is gonna be weird about us having sex in our room?”</p><p> </p><p>”Only one way to find out,” Agatha shrugs, a seductive smirk still lingering. </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t think anything of it at first, pulling back from reconnecting her lips to speak again at the last second.</p><p> </p><p>”Are you turned on by a potential rabbit voyeur?” Rio asks incredulously, huffing slightly at the absurdity of her own words. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer verbally, her face scrunching adorably as she purses her lips. </p><p> </p><p>“So, that’s not a no.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stays quiet, her face shifting again, now into an amused smile, stroking Rio’s cheeks as she continues trying to read her. </p><p> </p><p>“He’s our soonnn!” Rio whines, but Agatha giggles in response, looking up at her like she’s thoroughly entertained.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m sure he won’t even notice,” Agatha finally drops her joking smirk, back to being semi-serious, before Rio starts asking her about taboo kinks. “It’s fun to ragebait you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes before stealing another kiss. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Before they can even move to the bedroom, Rio makes the executive decision to move Scratchy’s crate into the living room, making sure his water is full and he’s comfy before heading back into the other room. </p><p> </p><p>The lights are dimmed halfway, a choice in front of them to prepare for sleep or something else.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lays on the bed scrolling through her phone, smiling to herself.</p><p> </p><p>”What?” Rio questions, mirroring the smile back. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re just cute.”</p><p> </p><p>”Just trying to be a good dad.” She offers, putting her own phone on the charger on her side of the queen sized bed. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her lip, locking her phone to turn to Rio. </p><p> </p><p>And Rio can still read the tell tale signs of a question on Agatha’s lips, the drop of insecurity in the hesitation. The residual effect of a mother that made every word feel like a war for 18 years of her life, the fountain of unlearning the heat of wondering out loud. Rio knows it isn’t personal, that Agatha had come a long way from needing her words coaxed out of her, that there had always been an unparalleled level of comfort between them, that it would only take another second for Agatha to swallow her fear and say whatever was on her mind. </p><p> </p><p>They’d both gotten used to the pattern, knowing when to push and when the moment could wait. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you want that one day?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her softly as she settles on the bed next to her, trying to receive the information slowly, to understand.</p><p> </p><p>”Kids?” Agatha clarifies, “Human ones.”</p><p> </p><p>They hadn’t really discussed it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had sort of thought Agatha was content without children, that perhaps up until this moment Agatha was focused on their own progress, finding the strength to learn how to exist on their own without a thought of what adding a child would change. But maybe too, there was this small bit of hope, that one day Agatha would want to try, in any capacity, adoption or IVF or sperm donors or any combination of it. Rio just knew that whatever choice they made, children or not, that they’d make it together when the time came. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, a soft smile, trying to contain the big emotions, afraid to show her cards at the chance Agatha pulls back, in case she was asking to confirm that Rio didn’t want them at all. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her lips, still relying on the nervous habit as she settles closer to her. Rio’s hand finds her chin, her thumb rubbing lightly underneath Agatha’s bottom lip to stop the assault. </p><p> </p><p>“I think when I was really little, I did.” Agatha explains, “Playing with dolls.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio holds her breath. Still close, waiting.</p><p> </p><p>”Evanora obviously made it clear that becoming a wife and a mother was expected.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifts minutely, caressing Rio’s wrist, anchoring herself to her. </p><p> </p><p>“And for a while I thought I’d withhold that from her, punish her in any way I could by refusing to have kids. But then that spite turned into wanting to raise children in the exact opposite way I was, a different way to get revenge.” </p><p> </p><p>They breathed together for a solid moment, letting the words stick, brown eyes reflecting the light of blue ones. Agatha still hadn’t exactly answered the question, but Rio would wait forever for the puzzle of Agatha’s thoughts to fill out. She still sat in awe at the way Agatha had learned to command her own words, the way she’d spent hours in the library rewiring the ire of her past into something woven by her own hands, a truth she could now spin out in her own time, the poems she began to write, the diaries she filled now simply because she could, evidence of not only her freedom, but what she decided to do with it. </p><p> </p><p>“But you’ve taught me that there doesn’t need to be a motive other than love,” Agatha whispers serenely, “I don’t want to have children to spite her, I want to have them one day, with you, because I know we both have so much love to give.”</p><p> </p><p>”You will be an amazing mother,” Rio offers back, meeting the same breeze of earnesty, holding her gaze like a guiding weight.</p><p> </p><p>They laugh, something soaked in emotion, a chuckle that borders on a sob. </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha kisses her again, it snakes over the same synapse of intimacy once more, a path paved over years of unforgiving kisses, a mark of every truth they’d shared, hushed and humble, a tally for every promise made and kept. </p><p> </p><p>It spoke of trust and vulnerability, a place where mistakes could be made without fear, a foundation that could be broken and rebuilt over and over. </p><p> </p><p>“Put a baby in me right now,” Agatha purrs against her, the ghost of unshed tears replaced with a torch of desire, her hand harsh against Rio’s ribs. She can’t help the way she sort of laughs into her mouth, pushing up a moment later to guide Agatha onto her back, like an unknown force unable to tell her woman ‘no’, dropping her weight to straddle her hips, grab both of Agatha’s hands to pin her arms above her on the mattress.</p><p> </p><p>”And who said you were in charge?” Agatha teases, the possessive glint in her eye, making Rio melt slightly, but her strength doesn’t give, leaning down to bite and suck a constellation into Agatha’s neck. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha bucks her hips into Rio, a moan escaping without warning, a sign that their game was still intact, Rio playing at control even if they both knew who ran things.</p><p> </p><p>”Cat got your tongue darling?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio bites harder, a shuddering gasp taking up all the air in the room. </p><p> </p><p>“Do I need to gag you, sweetheart?” Rio voices from her spot, not able to keep her mouth off her for long.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha muscles up using her hips to free her shoulders, wiggling her hands out of Rio’s grasp, flipping them over, settling herself higher over Rio’s waist, still sitting up. </p><p> </p><p>Rio lays back unamused, her hands wrapped around Agatha’s thighs.</p><p> </p><p>”You happy now?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles, her eyes full of joy. </p><p> </p><p>“Yep.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio helps her lift off her shirt, still amazed at the sight of perfect boobs for the millionth time, her hands quick to give her nipples attention, leaning up to attach her mouth to Agatha’s throat, pulling her back down against her.</p><p> </p><p>This never got old either, tracing the softness of skin that had been exposed to her thousands of times, the eagerness and intensity never quelled, the hunger never satiated. Because Agatha was beautiful, the gentle curve of her ribs that held up the roundness of her chest, the scattering of freckles over her shoulders, a dance of birth marks down her arms and over her sternum, the line of both hips, the bones jutting out in a way that sought Rio’s hands like a purposeful edge, her skin something like an addiction, the heat of her something she hated to be without, her throat, her hands, her chest, a feast begging to be tasted. And Rio loved to use her mouth, suck over her nipples like it was a game to find the delicious winces and startled moans from Agatha’s pretty mouth. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha humps into her, sinking forward to press her center into Rio’s abs, using the contact as leverage to keep Rio going. But Rio never needs prompting, Agatha on top of her, wanting impatiently. Her mouth travels down over her chest, pulling her up to straddle higher, biting over her nipples before kissing hungrily against her rib cage, her hands firm against her ass. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha angles back, separating them enough to snake her hand under Rio’s sweater, fighting to pull it completely off of her, she lets the sleeves stay around her wrists, tangling them purposely to keep Rio’s hands above her head, taking the opportunity to press her hands over Rio’s chest, rubbing over the cups of her bra, before pulling one side down, licking over nipple. Rio drowns in the pulse of it, the way her mind turns to mush.</p><p> </p><p>The rest of their clothes come off in a pattern of push and pull, a fight for control grounded in the fact that there was trust before anything else, that neither of them truly cared who held the power in the moment, more focused on bringing each other pleasure, on sharing in the intimacy. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s bare thighs wrapping around Rio’s bare hips, like a snap of a jaw over prey, her legs another place to worship, hands gliding from hips over thighs and back around, a dream of supple flesh, her nails pressing into her inner thigh bringing another whine out of Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls Agatha up again, angling herself to lay flat against the pillows, wanting to frame her own face with Agatha’s thighs. Rio whimpers as Agatha takes a fistful of her hair at the top of her head, centering her hips before easing fully over her mouth, Rio pulling her securely forward, willing Agatha to stop holding herself up, dropping her body weight slowly to rest on her face. </p><p> </p><p>The taste and feel is enough to make Rio whine into her, a vibration that sends the same chorus from Agatha’s lips. Rio’s chin and lips quickly wet with Agatha’s desire as she dips in deeper licking and sucking in a back and forth meant to tease more than start a meaningful pattern, a swing of lust and adoration that marks the truth that Rio would happily dine all night, a surge of worship that quaked at every sharp breath, the way Agatha’s hips stuttered against her, trying not to completely suffocate her, a war of need and the truth of each moan, the tightening of her grip on Rio’s hair. </p><p> </p><p>Rio flattens her tongue, prompting Agatha to grind against her, seeking more friction, her clit dragging back and forth, Rio happy to be used this way as Agatha’s movements become more shaky, a need as her orgasm starts to build.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio’s arms hold firmly around her thighs, halt the movement of her hips to dive back in, this time with careful attention to exactly what Agatha needs, flicking firmly against her clit, not letting her out of the relentless pattern as hips buck forward, as breathing strains pitches, short catches of higher and faster. </p><p> </p><p>“Babyyy,” Agatha pleads just as Rio starts adding suction, her orgasm crashing over a moment later, the top of her body sinking forward, no longer able to hold herself up, Rio doing her best to guide her gently to rest against the headboard without hurting herself. A sweaty piece of perfection slumping forward, Rio kissing her inner thigh as her breathing comes out in heavy gushes above her, rubbing over her back before redirecting her limbs to lay Agatha down, giving her a second to regain her sense of the present. </p><p> </p><p>But the worship is far from over as Rio presses a kiss into Agatha’s hair before rolling off the bed, dropping to her knees for better access to the bottom drawer of the nightstand on Agatha’s side.</p><p> </p><p>”What are you doing?” Agatha mumbles, suddenly aware of the lack of Rio’s touch. </p><p> </p><p>“Putting a baby in you,” Rio answers evenly as she stands back up, making quick work of the harness and dildo attachment, watching with pure lust as Agatha’s eyes brighten with renewed excitement, her mouth falling open. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha crawls towards her, still with her knees firmly planted on the bed as she grabs onto the silicone between Rio’s legs. Rio doesn’t allow her to push them forward yet, grabbing Agatha by the hair to recenter her focus first, pulling her into a bruising kiss, tasting herself on Rio’s mouth, who seldom had the decency to clean off her face, as she begins working her hand over Rio’s cock, preparing mentally for the length of it inside her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand breaks the kiss, her thumb pressing into Agatha’s mouth, her lips wrapping around it without force. Rio can feel the edge of her own breath, the way it rises in her chest, an attempt to tamp down the growing excitement, willing herself to be patient. </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha drops back down onto her elbows, Rio feels herself start to drool, blue eyes peering up at her as she begins to suck her off, it's a show of pretty lips and a skillful tongue just enough to haunt Rio’s wet dreams, just enough for ample lubrication. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha crawls up Rio’s body, clawing at her shoulders as Rio feels between her legs once more, a soft graze to her clit before sinking down as if to confirm that Agatha was still drenched. </p><p> </p><p>Rio angles forward as Agatha tries to pull her back on the bed, unable to wait any longer.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio pulls back, shaking her head slightly, the smirk of a devious plan painted on her lips, more than willing to take an extra moment here, watch as Agatha’s chest turns more red, feel her skin grow warmer somehow. </p><p> </p><p>“Over here, baby” Rio nods towards the opposite corner of the bed, taking Agatha’s hand to guide her, and Agatha doesn’t fight back, willing to see Rio’s idea through if it meant those smug lips remained, “On your knees.”</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps the angle seems awkward at first, Agatha balanced on the corner of the bed instead of the side, her knees firm against the mattress with Rio behind her, hands guiding her hips to arch her back. </p><p> </p><p>Rio sees the exact moment Agatha understands her plan when blue eyes find their own reflection in the full length mirror across the room, the perfect view of her boobs, sagging forward slightly, the peak of each nipple, the sheen of her own sweat, brown hair cascading over one shoulder, as she gets into position she can see the top of her own ass, Rio’s palms firm against the cheeks as she watches her watch herself. She can see Rio’s chest too, the hardened nipples a stark contrast to the expanse of soft olive skin, the adoration painted on Rio’s face.</p><p> </p><p>”You see how beautiful you are?” Rio asks dreamily, leaning over to press a searing kiss into her lower back. “So pretty,” Agatha can feel the wet surface of the toy pressed to her ass cheek as Rio molds them together, her arms sliding around her to grab at her breasts, squeeze them in her hands as her mouth continues up her spine.</p><p> </p><p>Rio can feel herself getting a little loopy, drunk off the burning heat of the skin she ached to kiss every chance she got, pulling back to run her hands down the front of Agatha’s thighs before readjusting her slightly, pressing the tip of her cock between her legs.</p><p> </p><p>She swipes the toy up first, making Agatha squirm as it rubbed against her clit, before slowly sinking it inside, watching Agatha’s face in the mirror, the flush of her cheeks, her mouth open with hushed breaths, her eyes watching Rio with rapt attention. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t help the way her hips press into the friction, her back arching more as she takes more and more of the dildo until she can feel Rio hips against her ass, the swallowed gasp as she pushes out a moan instead, as she sits with the feeling for a moment, unable to tear her eyes away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio already looks wrecked, her eyes unable to stay in one place, tracing over Agatha in the mirror to Agatha under her hands, her own breathing changing by the second, worked up by the sight alone. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha protests as Rio pulls out completely, a groan of frustration mixed with pleasure. </p><p> </p><p>“Baby,” Agatha pleads, thinking perhaps the teasing is just about to start, that the smirk on Rio’s face from before only meant war.</p><p> </p><p>”It vibrates,” Rio half croaks, her voice muted and far away. She says it like an offering, a choice for Agatha to make. </p><p> </p><p>“Please,” Agatha whines, somehow pushing her ass up even higher, only spurred on by the way Rio’s tongue moves through her mouth, pokes at the inside of her cheek as she presses the button at the base of the dildo.</p><p> </p><p>She watches the silicone spring to life, buzzing between her legs, the silicone wet and pulsing, it's a pleasant surprise when the vibration presses against her own clit, a stuttered gasp at the way she’s suddenly aware of how wet she is, previously solely concentrated on the woman in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>”Does it feel good, baby?” Agatha asks, easily catching the way Rio’s breath had changed in the reflection, the way her lips fell open in quiet ecstasy.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, finding Agatha’s eyes in the mirror again, unable to find the words.</p><p> </p><p>It takes an extra second to reorient herself, following the same path of pressing the tip to Agatha’s clit first, the reaction a bit steeper this time, the hushed curse as her head tucked down.</p><p> </p><p>As Rio sinks in this time, its bliss for both of them, the vibration pressing firmly inside Agatha, as the friction only grew more intense for Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“Shit,” Rio found herself humping into her for her own direct pleasure as well, chasing the same friction over and over as she built a slow rhythm, grabbing ahold of Agatha’s hair, her other hand harsh over her hip. </p><p> </p><p>Both fighting to keep their eyes open, Rio melting forward with each thrust, watching the way Agatha’s chest bounced softly with the movement, the shape of her lips around each needy groan, the way they moved together, both catapulted closer and closer to the edge with each passing second. </p><p> </p><p>The sound of Rio’s cock pressing in and out, the echo of Agatha’s wetness, the view fully on display for them both. Content to put Agatha on display for herself, something intimate and cosmic in the direct reflection of each surging movement, of each unfiltered sigh. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you close, baby?” Agatha asks, seeing the tell-tale signs of Rio’s drooping eyes, knowing her own arms might give out any second, the pleasure of the moment growing quickly as she felt herself getting close, her voice shrill and wanting.</p><p> </p><p>”Wait for me,” Rio mumbles, nodding as she quickens her pace slightly, hard and steady.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha does her best to hold out as Rio chases a similar timeline, Agatha’s orgasm crashing harshly as her face sinks into the mattress, Rio grabbing a better hold of her in an effort to stop her from falling off, the scream muffled slightly by the sheets.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio’s orgasm takes claim a moment later, her own groan echoing as her legs twitch, a concentrated effort in holding herself upright, the toy sliding out easily as Rio pulls back enough to wrap her arms around Agatha’s torso, pulling her up to lay back on the bed, saving them both from collapsing forward onto the floor.</p><p> </p><p>The heaving breaths fill the room like a quiet melody to the thundering beat of their hearts, both of them on their backs, Agatha’s body half on top of Rio’s, her shoulder digging into her rib cage, Rio’s arm pinned beneath her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes stay closed, feeling physically restrained even with half her body free, her leg muscles taut as she remains completely still, unbothered by Agatha’s elbow pressing against her, to the long brown hair in her face. </p><p> </p><p>It takes an extra moment to register the movement, thinking that with a few more breaths of air in her lungs, she’d pull Agatha further up the bed and tuck them in. But those tentative plans are soiled when she no longer feels Agatha’s body heat on top of her, the full expanse of her body exposed to the cold of the room.</p><p> </p><p>The bed creaks as Rio opens her eyes to find Agatha perched above her, balancing herself to rest a kiss on Rio’s temple, brushing any hair from her face before sinking lower to kiss her lips. Agatha kisses her like this is only the intermission, a sharp bite to the languid movement, enough to refocus their breathing. Rio’s hand moves to grab hold of Agatha’s jaw, needing to keep her mouth on her, stewing in the chaos of Agatha’s unchecked want, her heart open and giving, a need to receive all the dedication and praise in the same way she gave it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t break the kiss, biting down on Rio’s lip, but her hands move lower, the click of the harness opening on both sides, the angle of their mouths changing as Agatha pulls it down her hips. Rio can feel the full extent of the air finally hitting the wet skin between her legs, fully exposed now, her breath hitching against Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>Rio isn’t sure what direction the harness is tossed in, just hears the sound of it hitting the carpet floor, an idle thought of cleaning it in the morning, more concerned with the way Agatha’s thighs take its place, straddling her hips once more. </p><p> </p><p>There’s a wrestling match of sorts, a tangle of teeth and tongue, Agatha pushing against her, goading her into pushing back, there are no fists thrown, no words of mockery or hatred, just a battle of want curved slightly by the weak ache of their muscles, it becomes more clear everyday that they aren’t 18 anymore. But the soft exploration had become like a tantrum sometimes, a need to touch and be handled a bit less carefully, an urge to find the balance of pleasure and pain, a trust built on tangible weight.</p><p> </p><p>So Rio fought back in her own way, an attempt at not cumming again just from Agatha’s hand around her throat. She pushes her off only to wrap herself around Agatha’s middle, lifting her to be higher on the bed, Agatha scrambling to sit up by the head board, a smile of mischief and lust, proud of Rio for taking the reins even if she planned to take them right back.</p><p> </p><p>”Come sit in Santa’s lap, pretty girl”</p><p> </p><p>”Christmas already past, cariño,” Rio breathes back as she crawls up the bed, listening to Agatha’s wishes. </p><p> </p><p>“Consider it an extra gift for being so good this year,” Agatha husks against Rio’s ear as she settles into her lap, her knees on each side of Agatha’s hips, hands splayed across her thighs as she sank forward, ducking down to suck marks over Rio’s collar bones, teeth scratching against any available skin. </p><p> </p><p>Too concentrated on the feel of her tongue, Rio almost jumps from her spot when Agatha’s hand finds the apex of her thigh, a sharp moan that borders on a yelp, a catalyst to Agatha’s quiet laugh against her throat. </p><p> </p><p>“Can I touch you, baby?” Agatha clarifies, using her free hand to caress Rio’s cheek, forcing her eyes down to meet the dangerous sparkle of blue, clarity that her laughter held no malice.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods into her, forehead to forehead, eyes firmly shut as she tries to regain control of her breathing. She’d be embarrassed if it were anyone else, still, after almost a decade, losing her mind at the feel of Agatha’s hands on her, still severely under her power. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s thumb finds Rio’s clit easily, making use of the tilted angle, tender but certain as she marks over the area, guiding Rio to sit up slightly, arch further into her hold. Rio tilted further to kiss her again, something soft and tentative in the press of their closeness, the way Rio pulled back or slowed down to gently gasp, the way their mouths smooshed as her hips sank forward silently pleading for more. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked open as Rio angled back, eyelids low, mesmerized by the sight of her girlfriend writhing into her hand. </p><p> </p><p>“So pretty,” Agatha couldn’t help the praise, as Rio’s mouth hung open slightly, her eyes screwed shut as the feeling low in her gut built more and more. One of her hands took a firm hold of the back of Agatha’s neck, humping into the Agatha’s hand, a new angle born out of wanting to give Rio more, uncaring about the cramp in her arm she knew was coming as her pointer and middle finger slide over Rio’s clit in broad circles, a firm surface to grind into. She overextended her neck to raise forward, needing to press kisses into the side of Rio’s face. </p><p> </p><p>Rio could feel the static pain in her thighs, a desire to push past the way her knees burned from the bent angle of her legs, locked into the way her bones stabbed into the bed. But more overwhelming was the pulsing need pressing firmly into Agatha’s fingers, the crushing desperation to find her release, her hips stuttered a few more times, as Agatha’s fingers upped their speed, a silent conversation in the way her thighs began to shake and Agatha knew how to respond, doubling down on her previous efforts. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls her forward again, her fingers working faster as she tilts up again to kiss her mouth, Rio grabbing her face harshly as they meet in the middle, a mess of half swallowed moans as Rio cums, a shrill scream as her body sags fully into Agatha, her weight falling like a puddle. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha, but mostly the headboard, keeps them up right, Rio’s head falling onto Agatha’s shoulder, wrapping further around her. </p><p> </p><p>A moment of clear air, back to another synapse of breathing together, chests rising and falling in tandem, Agatha combing through Rio’s hair.</p><p> </p><p>But the static is rewired once more, Agatha’s fingers sliding down, purposely avoiding the over sensitive bud to finally press inside of Rio.</p><p> </p><p>”Fuck,” Rio mumbles again, further molding her face against Agatha’s shoulder, her hips angling up to give Agatha’s hand more room, widening her stance slightly, even if her body is still recovering. </p><p> </p><p>“You want me to stop?” Agatha asks as she presses in as much as her fingers allow, voicing it more out of wanting to hear Rio’s voice, shamefully wanting Rio to admit that she’d take anything Agatha was willing to give her, even if her body language was already making it clear that she wanted this, even if she’d just been freshly fucked. </p><p> </p><p>“Please, don’t fucking stop,” Rio pulls her hips back just to drop them back down on Agatha’s fingers, groaning at the feeling, asserting her power here, a clear show of keeping Agatha’s fingers where they belong. </p><p> </p><p>“Hmmm,” Agatha starts, “On second thought, I don’t think you need to cum again.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sits back enough to destabilize herself, grabbing onto Agatha’s working forearm, even though she’s made no physical effort to remove her fingers. </p><p> </p><p>“If you stop-“ Rio is cut off by her own moan, her eyes glazing over as she loses the fight in her voice. </p><p> </p><p>“If I stop, what?” Agatha asks, smug, her fingers still pressing in and out, Rio softly bouncing against her hand. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio tries again, almost choking on her own attempt at an inhale, “I don’t know, just please. Please.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t resist the begging, the curl of whines that press out of Rio’s mouth, kissing against her jawline as she tries to keep an even pace, making sure Rio’s clit feels the pressure as she tilts up on every thrust out, curling her fingers slighting as she presses further in. </p><p> </p><p>“Please,” Rio whines again a minute later, barely holding on, looking for some sort of verbal confirmation that Agatha was done teasing, wouldn’t stop now or any closer to Rio’s orgasm. </p><p> </p><p>“I got you, baby,” Agatha whispers, firm against Rio’s chin. </p><p> </p><p>Rio cums with a gush against Agatha’s fingers, her walls clamping down to keep her there, a halted groan that vibrated through them both, her body stiff and straight this time, riding out each fresh wave of pleasure, her hand wrapped in Agatha’s hair, a tight fist at the back of her head. </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha pulls her fingers out it’s slow and searching, grazing the side of wet lips before ghosting over her clit, testing. Every muscle in Rio’s body clenches against her, a stark warning that stops any movement.</p><p> </p><p>”Baby,” Rio gasps, her fist still locked into her hair, her body unmoving. </p><p> </p><p>“One more,” Rio can hear the pout in Agatha’s voice, easily swapped out to be the one begging now, an attempt at holding this power for another moment, loving the way Rio came undone because of her, never tiring of the way it made her feel like she was an all-powerful God. </p><p> </p><p>Rio peels back, finally loosening her grip on her hair, only to grab Agatha’s wrist out from between her legs. Agatha grumbles in disappointment, but helps Rio sit back on the bed, a relieved sigh as her legs flex out of the locked in angle, her muscles easing. </p><p> </p><p>She pushes up slightly to knock their foreheads together, kiss Agatha again until she stops pouting, both of them still filled with that electricity, the simplicity of their connection.</p><p> </p><p>”You’re trying to kill me,” Rio punctuates, her hand on Agatha’s face, a smirk built for her lips, something adoring and unfiltered, soft eyes saved for Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“Mmm” Agatha murmurs back, barely able to speak now, eyes heavy suddenly, pulling Rio’s face back to her. “Sleepy.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, still enamored by every growing twist, still enthralled with every new layer of the woman she was gifted with the chance to love. It tickled a piece of her heart that still sang like they were 14, like her crush had looked at her in English class, like her best friend had trusted her with a secret, like her girlfriend was choosing herself for the very first time. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Proverbs 3:15- She is more precious than rubies, nothing you desire can be compared unto her. </p><p> </p><p>The library had become its own place of worship, a building so old it had been made a historic landmark, legally protected. But Rio actually liked the book smell, the winding aisles of book cases, she liked people watching, a pre-teen struggling with a desktop computer, a young mother reading to her daughter cuddled up on a bean bag. </p><p> </p><p>But, of course, her favorite thing at the library was her girlfriend, a semi-permanent fixture, usually at her assigned desk, but often found with a cart of books to file back into their specific homes, or guiding someone towards the exact title they were looking for. </p><p> </p><p>Today though, Rio didn’t have to go looking. Agatha was at one of the front desks, her hair down, falling in its usually wavy chaos, a look that had always worked on her, glasses perched halfway down her nose. Rio’s eyes traced over the satin button-up, the way her blue eyes stayed fixed on the screen in front of her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio took an extra moment to admire her, taking advantage of the fact that she hadn’t caught Agatha’s attention yet. The ease of her jawline, the pink of her lips, pursing them in thought, something adorable in the expressions she took on when she thought no one was looking, the bump in her nose that Rio was obsessed with, the shadows of her eyelashes, every tilt and every line.</p><p> </p><p>”Can I help you with something ma’am?” Agatha’s voice sounds, her eyes still fixed on the screen in front of her, her hands still typing away, a clear sign that Rio had been caught staring, or perhaps that she’d seen her immediately, waiting for Rio to snap out of her reverie. </p><p> </p><p>But Rio wasn’t ashamed of her heavy attention, her tongue pressing into the side of her mouth to cover the desire to smile brightly at her girlfriend, a guise of playing Agatha’s little game if not starting her own. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I’d like to return these books, please.” </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps it wasn’t all a game, Rio had in fact brought some books to return, always taking out books to read to a) actually read them, and b) have a great excuse to visit Agatha at work. </p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Agatha’s eyes finally break from the computer to land on Rio, she licks her lips, maybe out of habit more than anything else, but Rio still tracks it, pulled in an inch closer by the small act, “Can I see your library card?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice is all business, a charade kept up, she knows full well the game of careful seduction, but even when she’s giving her nothing, it’s still working on Rio. Especially now, when they both know Agatha can look up her card with just her name, a name that Agatha moans in their shared bedroom regularly.</p><p> </p><p>”Of course,” Rio plays along, pulling her wallet out of her back pocket and handing over the card. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes it with more attitude than necessary, snatching it out of Rio’s grip with a questioning look. Rio watches as blue eyes trace over the information on the card before flicking up to find brown eyes, Agatha’s eyes scrutinizing over her winter coat, the features of her patient face.</p><p> </p><p>”Are you sure this is your library card? Rio? Is that how you pronounce it?”</p><p> </p><p>”Uh- yeah, definitely my card.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles at the way Rio stutters, as if making her girlfriend nervous like this was thrilling. </p><p> </p><p>“A very exotic name.” She deadpans, erasing the smile off her face as she snaps back into character, typing in the information.</p><p> </p><p>”I mean,” Rio smirks, leaning forward against the counter as her voice drops, “I can give you my last name if you’d like.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up at her, above the rim of her glasses. </p><p> </p><p>“Ms. Vidal, are you flirting with me?”</p><p> </p><p>”Is it working?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips purse again, an attempt at schooling her features down, even if Rio can sense the giggle fighting to come through. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you for returning the books, ma’am.” Agatha grabs both off the counter, pushing back her chair from the desk to place them on a cart behind her. </p><p> </p><p>“Wait,” Rio stalls, “I think I left my bookmark in the top one, can you check for me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha obliges, angling the book to flip through the pages quickly, stopping halfway through to find- not exactly a bookmark, but a piece of paper wedged in between the pages.</p><p> </p><p>’Will you be my Valentine?’ Written above a cute drawing of a cartoon Rio holding an azalea, standing next to cartoon Scratchy, eating some other flowers. Beneath it are two boxes labeled ‘yes’ and ‘no’ patiently waiting for a check mark. </p><p> </p><p>The next time Agatha looks up, she can’t hide the soft smile on her lips, the amused shine of blue eyes, the way she rubs her lips together before sliding her chair back towards the desk. Rio knows she’s done well by the way it takes Agatha an extra second to reel back her reaction, even if her girlfriend would never admit to her being smooth. </p><p> </p><p>Rio just watches and waits as Agatha pulls a pen from the cup on her desk, purple and glittery, hiding the paper behind the desk as she makes her selection, folding it for extra secrecy.</p><p> </p><p>”There you go, big boy.” Agatha’s voice finally dips into something sultry, sliding the paper into the front of Rio’s jacket where it was half unzipped to rest against her chest, tapping against her for good measure.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, swiping it from the spot, unfolding it to see Agatha’s answer like it was a college admissions letter, grinning too hard when she sees that Agatha had marked the ‘yes’ box with a cute purple heart.</p><p> </p><p>”Thank god,” Rio sighs, too dramatic, “I thought I was too late.”</p><p> </p><p>”Too late?” Agatha smiles openly at her now, actually curious.</p><p> </p><p>”Can’t have anyone else thinking they can claim you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs, shaking her head.</p><p> </p><p>”Are you busy? Can I bug you?” Rio asks after a moment passes, looking around to confirm no one was waiting around for Agatha’s help.</p><p> </p><p>Blue eyes train to the corner of her computer to check the time.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m gonna take my lunch in like 5 minutes, if you wanna wait for me, I just have to finish this quick.”</p><p> </p><p>”I can go across the street and get bagels, I’ll meet you back by the cafe?” Rio offers, knowing the shop across the street was her girlfriend’s favorite, the first place they’d taken Jen and Alice when they came to visit them last Summer. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled, nodding as Rio stepped back to leave. </p><p> </p><p>“Can I get a-“</p><p> </p><p>”I know your order, baby” Rio smirked, self-assured, now a few feet away.</p><p> </p><p>”I was gonna ask for a kiss,” Agatha pouted, but her eyes were so clear, a happiness that only radiated under special circumstances, a look Rio was always chasing. </p><p> </p><p>The chance to feel embarrassed by the oversight leaves quickly as Rio’s feet sprung up like she was ready to run a mile even if she only moved about 3 steps to get back to Agatha. She stood up from her chair, leaning over the desk to caress both of Rio’s cheeks, meeting her in a short kiss that still held the same electricity as it always did, a spark that never grew tiresome, a jolt that had never dulled. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Rio found Agatha exactly where she said to meet, a table they’d claimed many times in the little cafe area in the far corner of the library. They really only sold coffee, but the small pseudo-room of 6 tables served as a place to eat outside-food inside the library without greasing up the carpets, or ruining books. Sometimes Rio would sit here alone with a book, waiting for Agatha’s shift to end, nursing stale coffee and a candy bar from the vending machine. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat on the same side of the table that she always had, a claim made the first time and never switched, something cosmic about the way Rio had seen other people sit at ‘their’ table, but never when they intended to use it. </p><p> </p><p>A book in her hands, only a few pages in as Rio walked up, placing the paper bag on the table, alongside Agatha’s orange juice. </p><p> </p><p>“What ya reading?” She asks as she moves to take her coat off, noticing the cup of coffee already on her side of the table, smirking at the seamless way they cared for each other without having to speak it, the cap slightly off to let it cool, the 2 packs of sugar left beside it. </p><p> </p><p>“Something Billy recommended,” Agatha answers, “Gay hockey players.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled at the way Agatha didn’t move to put down the book, the fact that Agatha was still chronically not online and had no idea what Billy had gotten her into.</p><p> </p><p>”C’mon darling, supper is getting cold,” Rio jokes in an old-timey accent, pushing Agatha’s food towards her, the words landing even if both her bagel and juice were already intentionally cold. Rio grabs the orange juice, opening it for her without a second thought.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closes the book after a moment, saving her place. Rio had always joked that Agatha must be a serial killer, never using a bookmark, never dog-earring the page, simply remembering the page number and never forgetting it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio watches as Agatha takes off her glasses, placing them in the front of her shirt, before ripping open the wrapping of her bagel, basking in the way she was still taken with simple joys, perhaps conditioned to not take small things for granted, and while Rio had no questions about the ugly truth of where those habits were born from, it didn’t stop her from admiring the way Agatha took her time, accessed and calculated, make sure of what she wanted before she enjoyed it. </p><p> </p><p>It made it feel even more remarkable when she’d realized that she herself was one of the things Agatha had chosen, that they’d built this life together, cautious and not always confident, what always remained was the choice to do it together.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs at the first bite of her bagel, an order she’d perfected and never strayed from, an onion bagel with cream cheese and lox, and god forbid, never toasted, a splurge for smoked salmon with today’s inflation that Rio never hesitated on, well worth it to make Agatha happy, even if she needed a mint after. </p><p> </p><p>“Stop staring at me,” Agatha says between bites, kicking Rio lightly under the table.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m not,” Rio almost chokes on her own bagel, an everything bagel toasted with veggie cream cheese, “I’m just- admiring.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, but it’s more out of amusement than frustration, the way Rio still looked like a fawning cartoon character, actual heart eyes reflected in brown irises for her. After years of unfiltered love, the shattering care of Rio’s attention hadn’t waned, but Agatha had become more comfortable under its weight.</p><p> </p><p>It no longer felt like big shoes to fill, a person Rio thought she loved, but didn’t know the whole of. It no longer scared her, because this had finally started to feel like breathing, like she wasn’t climbing out of a trap of self-hatred anymore, this wasn’t a place to hide, a place to run from. Rio’s gaze is where she came to rest, where she came to thrive. The home they had built existed outside of the walls of their apartment, an ease that held across state lines, with oceans between them, a knowing that held all her grievances with life and still chose to keep going. </p><p> </p><p>Rio remembers a promise she made Agatha when they were 17. </p><p> </p><p>A promise that she couldn’t foresee the future, that there was no way to know who they’d be 10, 20 years from now, if they’d grow together or apart.</p><p> </p><p>A promise that a chance at better was enough for her, that she’d stick around through the moments that felt like stabbing edges, the lashing out, the nightmares, the pain of lapsing habits. That she was willing to use their love as a jumping off point for all the potential offshoots of hope. That the chance at better was worth every attempt even if at times it felt hopeless. </p><p> </p><p>The outcome was better than either could have ever imagined.</p><p> </p><p>She’s just glad they took that chance.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s heart swells as she walks home in the cold, fighting a smile that makes her look like a goofball. She’ll wait impatiently in the apartment for Agatha to finish work, pass the time letting Scratchy chase her around the apartment, texting Billy to stop teaching Agatha about books that will take up all her time, setting the thermostat warmer.</p><p> </p><p>It's a good problem to have, waiting for the woman she loves, even if she just saw her. A testament to fate, the flames lit a long time ago, that still burn. </p><p> </p><p>Rio thinks about God, about the things she’d lost and gained. The power of those teachings reflected in love, the power she sees in Agatha now. She thinks about destiny, being made with someone else in mind. </p><p> </p><p>She tucks herself against the couch, Scratchy tired from running around, curled against her thigh as she opens her laptop. </p><p> </p><p>“Can you help me pick one out?” Rio pats gently behind his ears, scrolling through tabs for engagement rings. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio sends some screen shots of potential rings to her parents (Scratchy not exactly a great helper), she laughs at her father’s immediate response.</p><p> </p><p>‘it’s about fucking time’</p><p> </p>
