<div class="userstuff">
<p>Having spent the better part of the day banging her head against the proverbial wall of her methodology section, Rio decides to give up and uses the remainder of the afternoon to make a pumpkin pie. She is not what anyone would call a natural in the kitchen, but she’s been writing non-stop for days and needs to get out of her head for a while, do something with her hands, get back into contact with the physical world.</p><p>In contrast to her and Billy’s kitchen – equipped for the purpose of making noodles and microwaving pop-tarts and not very much else – Agatha’s kitchen is like something out of a cooking show, all shining chrome, specialized equipment, and heavy, expensive pottery.</p><p>Rio’s quest to make a pie has left said kitchen an utter mess, but even so she’s quite pleased with herself when she pours the filling into the piecrust. It overflows a little, but she reckons it’s pretty good for a first attempt.</p><p>Agatha comes through the front door just as Rio slides the pie into the oven.</p><p>“Hi! I’m making a pie,” Rio calls out in warning, as Agatha hangs off her coat.</p><p>“A pie?” If Agatha is shell-shocked upon stepping into the kitchen and seeing the mess, she doesn’t show it. Instead, she wraps one arm around Rio’s waist, leans in to kiss the back of her neck, sending a flutter of shivers down Rio’s spine. “Hey,” she murmurs warmly into Rio’s skin.</p><p>“Hey, yourself.” Rio covers Agatha’s hands with her own, presses back into the embrace. “I’m making a pumpkin pie,” she responds, belatedly, to Agatha’s question, with no little amount of pride in her voice.</p><p>“Rehearsing for Thanksgiving?” Agatha steps away, grabs the sugar and the flour to start putting it away.</p><p>“Something like that.” Rio leans back against the kitchen counter. “About that,” she continues, taps at the counters with a finger. “You know I’m going home for Thanksgiving.”</p><p>Agatha makes a humming noise in response.</p><p>For a wild moment, Rio imagines her in all her glory – her sharp button-up, her wild hair, the heavy, esoteric pendant swinging around her neck – in her parents’ apartment; Agatha Harkness against the homey, beige <em>normality </em>of the Vidal family, and it’s as if her brain short-circuits for a second, giving her <em>404 File not found</em> in the stead of any idea of what that would actually look like.</p><p>“Well,” she continues, “since all of us are going home, we’re planning on having a little pre-Thanksgiving get-together this weekend, at mine and Billy’s.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha says. “Just don’t expect me to bake anything.”</p><p>“I...” Rio blinks, falters in the face of Agatha’s unexpected agreement, whatever arguments she’d prepared to get Agatha to come to the party forgotten. “Um, sure. No one is expecting you to bring baked goods, or anything, really.”</p><p>“Good.” Agatha is gathering up the spices, putting them back one by one in the rack. “I could bring some cheese, though. And wine.” She makes a face. “They’re all of drinking age, I hope?”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. “Yes,” she says.</p><p>“Well, I don’t want anyone to think I’m a corrupting influence on the young,” Agatha says, deadpan.</p><p>She stops in front of Rio, presses in close, and bends her head down to kiss her. Her back is warm against Rio’s palms through her shirt and when Rio pushes her nose into Agatha’s hair, she smells heavenly, of perfume and of herself, and Rio pulls her scent deep into her lungs.</p><p>“Except on me, I suppose,” Rio says, and grins widely in response to the dark look Agatha draws back to give her.</p><p> </p><p>After dinner, they take to what has become their customary seats on the sofa – Agatha in the corner with her legs in Rio’s lap, Scratch squeezed down between Rio and the couch and Sparky in Agatha’s lap – and tuck into the pie.</p><p>“It’s good,” Agatha says after her first mouthful, even though it’s a little burnt and a tad too sweet.</p><p>Before Rio can reply something to that effect, Agatha’s phone chimes. She pulls it out of her pocket and looks at the screen. It as if she stops breathing for a moment, body freezing, becoming stone, the muscles of her calves suddenly stiff and hard against Rio’s thighs.</p><p>Rio touches her ankle. “You okay?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha puts the phone away, text unanswered. “Yeah, I’m fine.”</p><p>Rio looks at her, but Agatha doesn’t meet her gaze, instead swiftly changes the subject to work, and Rio lets it go.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s like watching a shark trying to walk on land,” Rio overhears Jen whisper to Alice. Both of them are watching Agatha, seated on Rio and Billy’s couch, sipping on a glass of wine, from the relative safety of the kitchen.</p><p>Rio pinches Jen’s waist, which makes her squirm.</p><p>“Hey!” Jen tries to move behind Alice to use her as a shield. “Even you have to admit this is not her natural habitat.”</p><p>As one, both she and Rio look to Alice for reinforcement. “At least she brought snacks?” Alice says, holding up her hands to indicate that she doesn’t want to get dragged into it.</p><p>“‘Snacks.’” Jen scoffs, making exaggerated quotation marks in the air. “And she only brought it because she doesn’t want to stoop to eat our food.”</p><p>Admittedly, Agatha’s fare – expensive cheese, good red wine, and luxury truffles – does look a little out of place against the spread of mostly store-bought Thanksgiving staples Rio and Billy have prepared, crowned by a few loop-sided decorations of turkeys in pilgrim hats Billy and Eddie did in arts class. Jen might even have a point about the reason why she brought it. But she’s here and she’s being <em>nice</em>, letting Billy ramble on about his favorite witch movies without even looking bored, and Rio thinks that should cut her some slack.</p><p>Rio grabs the bread rolls, puts them on the rickety deck table they scavenged from an abandoned lot for this. She lights the candles, one by one, glancing over ever so often at the couch, where Billy is still talking, his gestures expansive, almost knocking over the wine bottle on the coffee table, which makes Agatha and Eddie exchange an amused look across his head.</p><p>Instead of returning to the kitchen, she moves towards their corner of the room.</p><p>“Hey.” Rio perches on the arm of the sofa, right next to Agatha. “You guys having fun?” She winds one arm around Agatha’s shoulders, bends down to kiss her hair, something swooping inside her chest at touching Agatha like this in front of people.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha says, only a tad drily. “I’ve just learned that I can just skip the remake of <em>The Craft</em>. Was it <em>The Craft</em> you forced me to watch the other night, the one with the demon girl?”</p><p>Rio laughs and steals the wine glass from her hand, says, “That’s <em>Jennifer’s Body</em>,” which causes Billy to let out a scandalous gasp at the thought of anyone mixing those two movies up.</p><p>Rio takes a sip of the wine. It’s really good. Two months with Agatha and she’s already getting used to all manners of expensive shit.</p><p>She hands Agatha the glass back. “You guys ready to eat?” she asks. When Agatha stands up, Rio snags her hand, braiding their fingers together. “I’m glad you’re here,” she murmurs into Agatha’s ear.</p><p>Agatha clears her throat, shoulders shifting under her mohair shawl. “Well,” she says, at last, quietly, breath hot against Rio’s cheek, eyes downcast. “It’s mostly for selfish reasons.”</p><p>Rio smiles at her at that, and has to reach up and cup her face and kiss her properly at that. If it turns a little too heated, into the kind of kiss that promises <em>more</em> later, it’s nobody’s business but theirs, she thinks.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is a surprisingly good sport all night, not even protesting when Billy, a few beers in, insists on bringing out his Ouija board since he never got a chance to use it during All Hallow’s Eve. He turns down the lamps, leaving the apartment shrouded in shadows cast by the flickering candlelight.</p><p>They’re all a little tipsy and a bit too full from the massive meal, giggling around the board as they put their fingers on the marker, and Rio has a hard time looking away from Agatha sitting across from her, her mind clouded and distracted by lust, a low itching beneath her skin, threaded through her pulse.</p><p>Agatha only puts one finger down, but she says nothing as Billy begins to invite the spirits to their seance, pitching his voice into a low, dramatic whisper.</p><p>It’s, admittedly, fun – Billy tries to keep the seance on track, but they all ask stupid stuff like, <em>Where are my favourite socks?</em> and <em>Should I meet up that girl from Tinder?</em> and <em>Will I pass my prelims?</em></p><p>It’s completely derailed when Eddie decides to ask<em> Is this the right time to tell Billy that I love him?</em>, causing the whole session to devolve into a chorus of <em>aww</em>’s, Billy immediately removing  his fingers from the marker to throw his arms around his boyfriend, while Jen and Alice wolf-whistles.</p><p>In the hubbub, Rio rises, grabs a half-full wine bottle off the table and takes Agatha’s hand. “Come on,” she says, urgently, and leads her into her room.</p><p>Despite being there before, Agatha looks around a little curiously, at the posters on Rio’s walls, the stacks of books balanced perilously on her desk and on the floor, an armchair in the corner covered in discarded clothes in various state of dubious cleanliness. Rio thinks of the last time Agatha was in this room, when she brought Rio back from her night out, made her breakfast and went down on her, and it makes her blood sing with desire.</p><p>They end up on the edge of the bed, Rio taking a swig from the wine bottle before handing it to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha gives it a dubious look, before tipping it in a toast in Rio’s direction and drinks from it. They kiss in between swigs of wine, sharing the bottle between them until it’s empty. Rio puts it on the floor, uses her newly freed hands to cup Agatha’s face and kiss her harder, slide her tongue into her mouth, tasting her, warm and wine-sour, feels the answering pull of want in the way Agatha moves in closer, opens up beneath her, in the soft sounds she makes.</p><p>Rio can’t remember if she did lock the door behind them, but neither of them care. Within minutes, eager hands are tearing at buttons and zippers, and Rio swallows Agatha’s moans as her own hands begin to wander, cups a breast to squeeze, thumb rubbing slowly across the nipple.</p><p>They end up with Agatha stretched out on her back and Rio on the floor between her legs, watching raptly as Agatha’s legs open for her, breathing hard at the sight of that thatch of dark hair, her pussy, pink and swollen and wet, labia slightly parted, as if begging Rio to come inside her.</p><p>Agatha makes a choked-off noise as Rio gathers up her legs over her shoulder and goes in, licks a stripe from where she’s open and wet to her tumescent clit, the musky-salt taste of her sharp in her mouth. She glances up, along Agatha’s pale soft stomach, the entrancing mounds of her breasts, her open, panting mouth.</p><p>She doesn’t know if she wants to drag it out or make Agatha comes as fast and explosively as possible; Agatha doesn’t seem to know either, the muscles of her thighs alternating between tensing and relaxing against Rio’s shoulders, her hand going into Rio’s hair to hold on, only to soften her grip and lay back, breathing out.</p><p>Rio feels her own cunt spasm, her own wetness, as she fucks two fingers into Agatha. It makes her arch and press down harder against Rio, chasing the slide of the tongue and the press of her fingers. Agatha’s hand is on her own breast, squeezing, rolling the nipple between thumb and forefinger.</p><p>She moans as Rio presses deep inside of her, pushes the pads of her fingers up into her, tongue and fingers working in tandem against her clit and her G-spot, feels Agatha’s thighs tremble, her moans growing louder. They’re probably too loud, too obvious, everyone in the apartment knowing exactly what they’re doing in here, but Rio doesn’t care.</p><p>Her world narrows down to Agatha’s need, her hunger, the feel of her body, her cunt, and she fucks Agatha harder, licks at her furiously, and it feels as if something is settling within her, some hollowness inside her filling up, feels the world aligning as Agatha tenses up and starts to seize, Rio buried between her legs, her whole face slick from it, fingers gripped hard by Agatha’s pussy, doesn’t really know, at this point, whether she’s giving or receiving, just knows that she never wants it to stop.</p><p> </p><p>As planned, Rio goes home for Thanksgiving. When she lands and restarts her phone, she has a text from Agatha already. When she swipes the message open, it’s a picture of Scratch and Sparky, curled together on Agatha’s bed, like a black, furry ouroboros. She smiles at it, sends a heart in return, and hitches her messenger bag higher on her shoulder as she walks towards the parking lot, where dad is picking her up.</p><p> </p><p>At first, it’s nice, being home. It’s a good distraction from work, if nothing else – pulling off a twelve-person Thanksgiving celebration without anyone starting an argument, accidentally breaking anything or having someone being disowned is not a feat for the faint of heart.</p><p>Rio hasn’t seen her nieces and nephews in months, except for on Instagram, and little Rosa is almost walking already, loudly demanding that one adult help her waddle around the apartment at all times by holding her chubby little hands, a responsibility Rio is happy to take on.</p><p>There’s a steady stream of texts going back and forth between Rio and Agatha throughout the day. Agatha’s working, going through her diary material, and she’s sending Rio some titbits here and there, along with her preliminary thoughts.</p><p>It makes Rio long for her own laptop, buried in the bottom of her bag, and to lose herself in the writing, pause the loud, messy family weekend for a minute. But she resists the impulse, not looking forward to her family’s reprimands, their disappointment. As much as they love her, they will never quite understand her need for solitude, the joy she takes in her work, at the cost of most other things in her life. It’s a bargain she’s perfectly happy to make, but one her family will never fully accept, which, she is coming to realize, puts a distance between them and her.</p><p><em>am I a psycho for wanting to write on my diss rather than hanging out with my family?</em> she texts Agatha early the next morning.</p><p><em>Fuck that</em>, Agatha replies, near immediately. <em>Family’s overrated</em>.</p><p>That almost makes Rio laugh out loud, especially when, a moment, later the addendum, a sheepish <em>No offense</em>, arrives.</p><p>Rio goes to take a shower, and has to suppress a sudden longing for Agatha’s naked body next to her, for the feel of her accompanying the hot spray of water upon Rio’s skin. She texts Agatha as much when she heads down to the kitchen, and Agatha simply replies <em>Me too</em>, which makes something warm alight inside of Rio. </p><p>They keep texting back and forth as Rio eats breakfast and has her coffee at the kitchen island, just casual messages about how they’re spending the day, and a couple of cat photos. Rio sends back a quick selfie of herself in her old ratty Nightwish shirt found in the closet, hair still wet from the shower. She doesn’t get one back, but Agatha does send her a pic of Sparky, indolently stretched out in Rio’s spot on the couch.</p><p>“Who are you texting?” Sierra asks as she enters the kitchen behind Rio, a sullen Rosa on her hip.</p><p>“No one,” Rio says, too quickly, and her sister quirks a brow at her over her niece’s head. Rosa starts to whine, arms reaching for Rio, and Sierra quickly hands her over before heading over to the fridge. She starts pulling out ingredients for pancakes.</p><p>“You got a girlfriend in Boston?”</p><p>Rio brushes the air out of Rosa’s eyes, shrugs. “Kind of.” Rosa squirms in her arms, wanting to get down, and Rio lets her, bends down to grab her hands, starts walking her across the floor. “I don’t know, it’s new.”</p><p>“She nice?”</p><p>Rio steers Rosa away from waddling straight into the dishwasher. “No,” she says and laughs.</p><p>Across the kitchen island, Sierra gives her a strange look.</p><p> </p><p><em>this is my youngest niece</em>, Rio texts along with a picture of Rosa. <em>she just accidentally pulled out a clump of my hair but I still love her</em></p><p>Agatha doesn’t reply. Rio doesn’t think it’s strange; she has no idea whether Agatha is fond of children or not, but she can make an educated guess.</p><p>She keeps sending her stupid, inane shit. A picture of her old room, the view from her window, random thoughts – about her writing, New York, sex.</p><p>Late in the afternoon, Fiona texts: <em>hey you in town</em>.</p><p>Rio and Fiona went to high school together, when Rio was out and Fiona was not, and ran into each other one summer when Rio was back from college and have been hooking up on occasion – mostly during the holidays – ever since.</p><p><em>yeah</em>, Rio texts back. She hesitates, toys with the phone cover, then quickly taps out, <em>but i’m seeing someone</em></p><p><em>ugh lucky u</em>, Fiona texts back. <em>is it serious??</em></p><p><em>it is for me</em>, Rio writes, feeling a strange ballooning sensation in her chest at putting it into words for the first time. <em>I think it’s for her too. idk it’s new</em></p><p><em>oh well congratulations i guess</em>, Fiona writes, making Rio smile. <em>i’d ask you out for a friendly beer, but really need to get laid + do not want to spend another night under my parents’ roof. i’m going insane over here</em></p><p><em>well best of luck to you</em>, Rio writes, to which Fiona replies with a sarcastic thumbs up.</p><p>Rio exits the conversation with Fiona and taps on Agatha’s name instead. She hasn’t replied to any texts since this morning. She’s probably working, Rio thinks, or has put her phone down somewhere and forgot about it, as she’s wont to do.</p><p>But the whole day passes without any reply from Agatha, and then Saturday rolls around with more of the same. At noon, Rio caves and texts a<em> you ok??</em> but that, too, is only met with radio silence.</p><p>At last, Sunday afternoon, about an hour before Rio is leaving for her plane ride home, Agatha replies. <em>Had to go out of town for a little while, but I’m back now</em>.</p><p>Rio bites down on the impulse to call her. <em>why??</em> she texts back instead. <em>did something happen?</em></p><p>She puts down the phone and forces herself to focus on packing up her stuff instead of staring a hole into her screen. By the time she’s on the plane, getting ready to flip on airplane mode on her phone, Agatha has still not replied.</p><p> </p><p>When she lands, she sends of a quick <em>Can I come over?</em> to which Agatha replies, <em>Sure</em>. Agatha’s never a gregarious texter, so it probably doesn’t mean much, but still, something feels off to Rio. She goes by her own place first, to leave her stuff, before going over to Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha meets her at the door, starts to kiss her before its even completely closed behind Rio, kisses her hungrily, impatiently, hands already going up to start unbuttoning her own shirt.</p><p>Rio thinks about saying something along the lines of: <em>Hey, how are you? Are you okay? </em> but it gets lost somewhere between her mind and mouth, scrambled by Agatha’s eager kisses, the hot press of her body against Rio, the feel of her waist beneath Rio’s hands. It’s easy to match Agatha’s desperation, because it’s in Rio too, born out of four days away, fueled up and ready to spark at the barest touch of Agatha’s skin against hers.</p><p>Agatha wants it hard and rough, but Rio doesn’t think anything on it, familiar with the usual play of surrender and power between them. Rio sinks into her from behind, entranced by the sight of Agatha taking the strap, so wet and needy for it, on her hands and knees on the bed, legs splayed open and back arched. There is nothing Rio finds more erotic than the act of entering a woman, being entrusted with it, given leave to give pleasure, and there is something about Agatha specifically, about the push and pull between them, that heightens it further, makes her feel slightly crazed from it every time.</p><p>She fucks her hard and steadily, hands firm on her hips to guide her into a rhythm, and feels, for the first time in days, like she’s finally home, where she belongs. It’s a scary thought, so she pushes it away, thrusts harder into Agatha, lets her panting noises – almost but not quite begging for it – distract her, carry her away, eyes fixed on where they’re joined, hands gripping harder onto her hips, obsessed by the feel of her, needy and near.</p><p>Agatha crumbles down onto her elbows with a moan, and Rio feels it in her own body, reverberating back, her own cunt pulsing slick between her thighs.</p><p>“Yeah?” Rio says, softly. “You like that? Is it good?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha gasps, and on the next thrust, her hand steal down between her legs to start fingering her clit, and her head falls down, the muscles in her back moving along with her fingers and Rio’s increasingly erratic rhythm.</p><p>Agatha lets out a deep groan, hips moving to fuck herself back onto the strap, her free hand clenched into the bedding. “Fuck, it feels good, don’t stop, it feels so fucking good, baby. <em>God</em>, I missed you.”</p><p><em>That</em> makes Rio falter for a fraction of a second, knees slipping on the bedding as she blinks, surprised, but she only murmurs “Me too,” fervently, and fuck Agatha harder when she asks for it, a steady stream of words falling out of her mouth now.</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha moans again. “It’s so good, you feel amazing in me, baby, I love it, I love <em>you</em> – <em>fuck</em>!” The last word is long and drawn-out as Agatha comes, as ferociously and sudden as a lightning strike, shouting out her pleasure as she collapses down on the bed.</p><p>Distantly, the sudden silence ringing in her ear, brain brought completely offline by what just came out of Agatha’s mouth, Rio pulls out of her, moves away to unsnap the harness with shaking hands.</p><p>Agatha, apparently completely clueless about what she said, what just happened, curls in close, asks Rio what she wants, and then moans in her ear as her fingers find Rio’s wet cunt. She comes embarrassingly quick on Agatha’s fingers, her face in Agatha’s hair, surrounded everywhere by her skin, her scent, and her warmth, letting the pleasure overtake the empty, yawning void in her mind.</p><p>They fall asleep like that, sticky all over and curled together in the middle of the mattress, two pieces of a puzzle locked together.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio wakes the next morning, Agatha is nowhere in sight. She can hear noise emanating from the kitchen, so she hasn’t gone far, but to Rio it suddenly feels like a chasm is yawning between them, the few steps to the kitchen an unscalable distance of treacherous terrain.</p><p><em>I love you</em>.</p><p>Rio doesn’t even know how to begin to decide what she feels about it, Agatha saying it like<em> that</em>, thrown out in the heat of the moment. Or she does, she realizes with a sinking feeling in her chest. She knows exactly how she feels about it, and it’s horrible, because those three stupid, carelessly spoken words echo in her mind, in the cavity of her suddenly hollowed out chest and makes her realize, belatedly, that she does, in fact, love Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“We need to talk,” she says as soon as she steps into the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha, over by the counter, looks soft and approachable in her robe even as she’s busy cracking open eggs into a bowl. Rather than borrowing something from Agatha, as she usually would, Rio’s back in her jeans and hoodie, armored against this inevitable conversation.</p><p>Rio continues, before Agatha has a chance to reply. “You can’t just <em>do</em> stuff like that, Agatha. It’s not fair<em>.” I know we don’t really talk about what this is, but that doesn’t give you leave to be needlessly cruel</em>, she wants to say.</p><p>To her surprise, Agatha does look contrite. It’s a strange look on her. She clears her throat, curls her fingers restlessly around the ladle lying on the counter. “I know,” she says. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know – I didn’t think.”</p><p>Rio’s heart feels heavy like a stone in her chest. A part of her had hoped that perhaps Agatha had meant it, that she was in as deep as Rio is just now finding out she was, that she wouldn’t try to walk it back.</p><p>“I just–” Agatha swipes a hand across her face. “She just drives me completely crazy, and whatever I do, it’s the wrong choice.”</p><p>“I...” Rio’s forehead furrows, as Agatha’s words sink in. “What? What are you talking about?”</p><p>Agatha looks at her, her mouth set into a thin line. “About where I was these last few days. I went back to Salem, to see my mother.”</p><p>Rio blinks at her, taking a moment to put the confusing pieces together. “Oh.” She doesn’t know what else to say; they haven’t talked about Agatha’s mother since that day Rio saw that text from her and they had a fight about it, in this very room.</p><p>“What are <em>you</em> talking about?” Agatha asks.</p><p>Rio sinks down into a chair. She pulls her knees up, curls her arms around them. “What happened last night,” she says. “When you... What you told me.”</p><p>Part of Rio expected her to simply deny it, pretend that it didn’t happen, but instead, it’s Agatha’s turn to go, “Oh.”</p><p>She turns back towards the counter, picks at the eggshells. She exhales in a long, shivery breath. “Well, I didn’t mean to.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio says, heavily.</p><p>Busying herself with pouring flour and sugar into the bowl, Agatha says, “I know it’s too early, I just... got carried away.” She glances at Rio over her shoulder. “It doesn’t have to be a big deal. I don’t expect you to say it back or anything.”</p><p>She bustles over to the spice rack, picks out salt and cinnamon. Rio watches her confused. Her fingers are picking at the tear across the knee in her jeans, thumb digging into the revealed skin there. She opens her mouth. No words come out, so she tries again. “What,” she says, almost angrily, “is that supposed to mean? Are you saying you<em> did</em> mean it?”</p><p>Agatha stiffens, seems really adamant about getting the exact correct amount of cinnamon into the bowl by the intense attention it seems to require.</p><p>“Yes,” she says at last, sounding annoyed. “Of course I did.” She sends Rio another backwards glance. “You said it yourself. I’m only capable of expressing my feelings when we fuck.” Her mouth twists and she turns back to whatever concoction’s in that bowl.</p><p>But Rio is already on her feet, something swooping inside her chest. She embraces Agatha, her hands going out to land in their customary place on Agatha’s hips. She’s unyielding beneath Rio’s touch, turns her face further away, her breathing fast and high in her chest.</p><p>“I love you, too,” Rio tells her, quickly, the words stumbling out, feeling outlandish but right in the bright kitchen, and she can <em>feel</em> the palatable wave of relief weave its way through Agatha’s body in the minute way she relaxes back into Rio’s hold, Rio’s hands tightening their grip against her waist.</p><p>“Well, you better,” Agatha mutters after a few seconds, already back to sounding more like her usual self. “I’m making you French toast on brioche.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans as she digs into the breakfast Agatha has prepared: the French toast is sinfully lavish, topped with maple syrup and fresh raspberries. She wouldn’t have expected it in a million years, but Agatha is a really good cook, when she wants to.</p><p>Over the rim of her coffee mug, Agatha looks pleased.</p><p>“So,” Rio says, at last, when she’s mopping up the last of the maple syrup with a crust of bread. She’s more than a little reluctant to shatter this moment between them, sweet and fragile like a sheet of new ice, only barely strong enough to stand on. “Your mother.”</p><p>Predictably, that makes Agatha tense up again. She sets the coffee mug down with a sharp noise. “What about her?”</p><p>Rio picks up a raspberry, turns it over. “Well, what’s the story there?”</p><p>Leaning back in her chair, Agatha sighs. “Could I just say that Salem has one actual witch and leave it at that?”</p><p>Rio says nothing.</p><p>Agatha sighs again, looks at Rio. Says, a little challengingly, “One big confession a day isn’t enough for you?”</p><p>“The other one was technically yesterday,” Rio says, unforgiving.</p><p>Agatha scrubs a hand across her face. “She’s a shit mom,” she says finally. “She raised me alone, I’ve never had a father, and I don’t care about that except for the fact that the one parent I <em>did</em> have didn’t care for me and made that fact very clear.”</p><p>She takes a sip of coffee, wraps her hands around the mug, as if she’s suddenly cold. “I don’t know why, or what I did to disappoint her so, but it only got worse when I moved out – and when I came out.” Agatha rolls her eyes. “She really hated that. She’s a historian too, in human pre-history. I thought maybe I could gain some sort of recognition from her that way, following in her footsteps, I guess, but it didn’t turn out that way.” She laughs bitterly.</p><p>The words keeps streaming out of Agatha, as if a wound’s been let opened, the pus pouring out. “And now she’s old and frail and hates me for not being there for her. She called me over Thanksgiving, said she’d taken a fall. She has a nurse, but I don’t know, I felt bad enough for ignoring her ever since, so I drove out there.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes are steadily fastened on the table, hair falling in a curtain across her face. Rio reaches out, curls her hand around Agatha’s wrist, thumb rubbing across the nob of bone there.</p><p>“She was fine, of course,” Agatha continues. “I don’t know if it was a complete false alarm or if she had, like, bruised her knee, but she certainly seemed hale and hearty to me.” Her tone takes on a note of sour sarcasm. “She was her usual viscous self, very pleased with having dragged me all the way out there.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio says, but it feels very inadequate.</p><p>“Yeah, well.” Agatha shrugs, as if it isn’t entirely obvious how much it pains her.</p><p>“Do you want me to hold you? Rio asks, softly.</p><p>“<em>No</em>,” Agatha replies vehemently, but that’s clearly a lie, so Rio rises and puts her arms around her, and Agatha doesn’t protest.</p>
