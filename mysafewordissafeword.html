<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>
<i>“Oh, you’ll have to tie me down if you want me to submit to you,” Agatha explains casually.</i>
</p><p> </p><p>
<i>Rio stares, trying to process that. “I need to tie you down?” she says, bewildered. “For you to… get into the correct headspace?”</i>
</p><p> </p><p>
<i>“No, I will literally fight you if you don’t tie me up. And I mean entirely immobilized. I’ll claw your eyes out or try and bite you otherwise.”</i>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness has been accused of being a bad sub. She categorically denies it, and hires a dominatrix to prove it. She is by far the most interesting and challenging client Rio Vidal has ever faced.</p></blockquote>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>The address she’s been given belongs to the most suburban, white-picket-fence family home that Rio could have imagined. It’s large, maybe three or four bedrooms, with a wide front lawn with grass and landscaped garden beds instead of cheap turf, and probably has a backyard that’s equally as big and manicured. Importantly, it’s a house that likely cost a pretty penny, which is good news for Rio; the rich, wealthy, and bored always make for the best clients.</p><p>The house is located in a nondescript New Jersey cul-de-sac on the outskirts of a dead-in-the-water town called Westview; the town’s only call-to-fame is it’s situated ten minutes from the I78, a highway that’s a straight shot into New York and Manhattan. Rio can understand why people would want to live here. It’s quiet, spacious, and easy to commute to the city; Rio lives in Newark, and it was less than an hour’s drive to Westview.</p><p>Parked in her tiny sage Mini Cooper on the street, Rio switches the headlights and engine off. Considering it’s Monday evening, there aren’t all that many cars parked out on driveways, and there don’t seem to be any parking meters, so she’s not scared to park on the curb.</p><p>She pulls out her phone to review the client consultation email. Agatha Harkness, age 51, single, lesbian. No criminal record. Self-described as highly sexually experienced, experienced in BDSM, and requiring somebody who is not afraid to be forceful and rough with her. Paid the full consultancy fee up front, which is <i>highly</i> unusual considering its cost.</p><p>Rio sighs, runs her fingers through her hair, and checks the time. Five minutes until seven. She sends the obligatory safety texts off to her agency colleagues with the address and time of entry, before clambering out of her car and picking her briefcase up from the passenger seat footwell.</p><p>As she approaches the house, projecting confidence, Rio swiftly glances herself over. She’s wearing a black body suit with long lace sleeves and skinny jeans, and an emerald green overcoat to keep warm. Her hair has been straightened, and she’s put on dark smoky make-up. She looks hot as fuck, but professional. None of her clothes are coming off tonight, but it’s crucial she makes a good first impression.</p><p>Rio likes her job. It started off as an unconventional side hustle during college, whilst she was studying for a degree in plant sciences. But then Rio realized that she enjoyed the work, she was unusually talented at it, and it made decent money. It scratched an itch inside of her that becoming a plant biologist never could. So she reversed her life; now her side hustle has become her full-time job, where she works for an agency and makes more money than she knows what to do with, and she runs a plant nursery as her hobby.</p><p>Finding new clients, however, can be daunting - not to mention dangerous. And today she is meeting a potential new regular, so she’s more anxious than normal.</p><p>Switching her suitcase into her offhand, Rio knocks on the front door of the house. Despite it not being all that dark yet, as it’s early evening, the porch lights are switched on. Stepping back, she waits, tapping the toe of her ankle boot on the ground.</p><p>The woman who opens the door to greet her is middle-aged, well-groomed, and <i>absolutely stunning</i>. She is certainly not going to have any issues <i>performing</i> if this is the woman she will be servicing. She’s ridiculously beautiful, so much so that she can’t believe that she’s still single. Surely she has hoards of horny lesbians chasing her tail? If she weren’t Rio’s client, and she saw her in a bar - hell, <i>she</i> would approach her and ask to buy her a drink.</p><p>Luscious thick dark brunette hair frames her sharp, angular face, falling down her back in waves; piercing sky-blue eyes narrow as they examine Rio, flickering up and down her scrutinisingly. Her tongue darts out to wet her lips as she adjusts the belt of her flowery kimono robe, which Rio reckons cost several hundred dollars.</p><p>Rio knows from experience that her first expression of a client is typically spot on, and can dictate what to expect. Rio takes one look at Agatha Harkness and knows immediately that she is going to be a handful.</p><p>“Miss Harkness?” she asks politely.</p><p>The woman smirks. “Lady Little Death.”</p><p>Oh yes, she was definitely correct in her assessment of this new client being a troublemaker. “Yeah, don’t call me that. That’s just the stage name the agency likes to use when they book me out. I respect my clients enough to use my actual name. Rio Vidal,” she introduces herself, offering her hand. “You can call me Rio.”</p><p>Agatha eyes her dubiously. She takes Rio’s hand and shakes it firmly. Her hand is soft and warm, steady as anything. She is not at all nervous about what is happening. “This is a business transaction. I will call you Miss Vidal,” she declares. She opens the front door wide and steps aside, gesturing with her arm. “Come in, please.”</p><p>Rio nods, and enters the house. It’s nothing special. Plainly painted, generically decorated. Standard of a rental. The furniture is nice and clean, and the floors have been swept. Obviously, the house is well taken care of. Agatha leads the way into the open-plan living room and kitchen space, motioning to one of the white leather couches. Rio takes a seat, perching lightly on the edge of the cushions as she lays her briefcase on the coffee table in front of her.</p><p>She turns around to perform all her security checks and ensure she knows the location of every door, window, and exit of the house, and is shocked silent when she sees that Agatha is in the process of untying and shedding her robe.</p><p>“What are you doing?” she yelps, slapping her hand over her eyes just in time, because she catches a fleeting glimpse of sheer purple lace but nothing else, (un)fortunately.</p><p>“Taking my robe off, obviously,” Agatha laughs. “I checked and the bank transfer cleared this morning, so why waste time?”</p><p>Rio thought the email was <i>pretty</i> clear about what this meeting would consist of, but maybe Agatha did not read it thoroughly.</p><p>“Yeah. No. That’s not how this works,” she sighs. She peeks through her fingers, and is relieved to see that Agatha has redressed. Her client does not, however, look particularly pleased. “This is a <i>consultancy</i> meeting.” The older woman appears unimpressed, crossing her arms. So Rio reminds her, sternly but not rudely, “I’m a dominatrix, Miss Harkness, not a bog-standard sex worker. No clothes will be coming off at all until we’ve negotiated terms and the paperwork has been signed.”</p><p>“I’m a lawyer, I know how contracts work,” Agatha says, rolling her eyes. “Fine. If we really have to <i>negotiate</i>, then let’s go into the kitchen so I can drink wine whilst we do it. This might be the first time I’m paying somebody else to read their contract.”</p><p>“Then it’ll be an exciting new experience for you,” Rio deadpans.</p><p>She maintains a flat expression, but is somewhat put at ease, because if Agatha just wanted to use her for sex, then she would not be willing to sit down and read over the contract. She picks up her briefcase and tails the woman over to the breakfast bar. She hops up onto one of the stools. The kitchen is all clinical white marble and black accents, and looks like it’s come straight out of a showroom.</p><p>“Nice house. You found this on AirBnB?”</p><p>Agatha glances over her shoulder from where she’s pulling a bottle of chilled Sauvignon Blanc out of the fridge. “No, it’s my home. Why would I book an AirBnB? I’m not fucking in somebody else’s bed,” she sneers. Rio blinks at her, taken aback. It’s frankly insane to her that a highly paid lawyer has just invited her, a dominatrix, into her <i>home</i>. “Why so surprised?”</p><p>“The vast majority of my clients hire out hotel rooms or AirBnBs for our sessions,” she tells her truthfully, busying her hands by carefully extracting the contract, in its protective plastic wallet, from the briefcase. “And this is the first time a potential client has invited me into her home for a consultancy.”</p><p>Agatha pours two glasses of wine, despite Rio declining the alcohol. She never drinks when she’s working. “Yes, well, I can guarantee that I will not be anything like your ordinary clients,” she says bluntly. Her heavy gaze lands on the contract and she leans against the counter, taking a swig of her wine. “Give me that thing to read over and get comfortable.”</p><p>Rio slides it across the breakfast bar, directly into her hands. “Are you the type of lawyer who dissects the fine print?” she asks, already knowing the answer.</p><p>“I’m the type of lawyer who wins cases,” Agatha sniffs, wrangling the stack of paper out of its flimsy wallet to begin leafing through it. She reaches into her robe pocket and fishes out a pair of square-frame reading glasses, pushing them up her nose. Jesus Christ, she looks even hotter. Rio feels a flutter of heat in her lower abdomen when Agatha peers up through her lashes at her with a smug grin. “Criminal defense, if you were wondering about my expertise. Best in the state.”</p><p>“I’ll keep that in mind if I ever need legal aid,” she says dryly.</p><p>Agatha looks back down at the contract, flicking through the pages as she apparently speed-reads. She swipes up a pen from the side, scribbling notes in the sections where it requests her notes and additions. “Keep it in mind if you ever contemplate breaking confidentiality,” she replies, and there’s a hint of warning in her voice.</p><p>Rio is used to being threatened to keep her mouth shut, even though the contract specifies that she will award her client the utmost privacy. Normally, she’s not at all intimidated by their paltry ultimatums; if her clients feel the need to posture, she lets them, because it won’t ever amount to anything. With Agatha, however… a shiver runs down her spine. She has a feeling that Agatha would follow through with all her threats and leave Rio wishing she was dead after being eviscerated in court.</p><p>It’s really fucking attractive.</p><p>“Our meetings will be as discreet as you wish them to be,” she promises.</p><p>After another five minutes or so of thumbing through the pages of the contract, writing in the sections that require it, and Agatha sets the pen down. She snags Rio’s untouched glass of wine and swaps it for the contact, slapping it on the counter in front of her while throwing back Rio’s wine, draining it in just a few gulps.</p><p>“That was quick,” Rio comments warily. <i>Too quick.</i></p><p>“I’m a fast reader,” Agatha shrugs.</p><p>Even if she is the fastest reader alive, it should have taken her at least twenty minutes to go through the contract fully, reading every single line. Which probably means she skimmed it over. “Any questions?”</p><p>Agatha snorts. “No.”</p><p>“None? Nothing you need clarification on? You understand all the terminology used?” she presses.</p><p>Her client throws her head back with an exasperated sigh. “This isn’t my first foray into the world of BDSM, Miss Vidal. Trust me, I understood everything just fine.”</p><p>Rio squints at her, baffled by Agatha’s nonchalant attitude. She skips through the contract to the most important section, the one where the client’s input is vital for determining whether or not they will be compatible: setting boundaries.</p><p>It’s where Rio has listed out her own soft and hard limits, and her specialties in terms of kinks and fetishes. It’s also where her clients are presented with a long, <i>long</i> tick list, of kinks and fetishes to select as requests or as limits. Her eyebrows rise into her hairline as she trails her gaze down the page, and onto the next one, where the list continues.</p><p>Literally nothing has been ticked under the soft and hard limits section. In fact, in the Other box at the bottom of the lists, for clients to add things that aren’t already itemized, Agatha has the audacity to have scrawled <i>N/A</i>.</p><p>She looks up at Agatha with a quirked eyebrow. “If that’s the case, then why did you put not applicable under hard limits?” Only somebody who does not understand how BDSM works would have written <i>that</i>.</p><p>Agatha does not seem to recognize the problem. “I don’t have any.”</p><p>“So you’d be totally okay with me spitting on your face?” Rio asks testingly. Surely Agatha has <i>something</i> that she dislikes when it comes to sex? Unless her client is a complete freak. Which… could be possible. Looking at Agatha, she’s probably into something wild, like feral play with scruffing and full-blown biting.</p><p>Her client tilts her head, like a curious spaniel. She looks both adorable and menacing. “Do you <i>want</i> to spit on my face? Have I already annoyed you that much?”</p><p>“Jesus Christ, you are going to be such hard work,” Rio mutters under her breath.</p><p>Fine, then… if Agatha says she has no limits whatsoever, then she is going to treat her like a BDSM baby - a complete newbie, who has never partaken in it before. Better she treats Agatha like a rookie who doesn’t have any clue what she’s doing than misstep and risk harming her.</p><p>Raising her voice, Rio states strongly, “I don’t do any breath play, impact play, anything to do with knives or blood, or watersports during my first session with clients.”</p><p>Agatha stares at her as if she’s grown a second head. “I’m hardly going to ask you to talk about water skiing when you’ve got your fingers shoved up my cunt,” she says, incredulous.</p><p>Rio manages to stifle her bark of laughter into a cough. “That is not what watersports means,” she informs her client flatly. “Okay, if you’re not going to list any hard limits, then I’ll be treating everything on that list as soft limits, except what you’ve listed under desires.” She glances over the lists yet again, focusing less on the limits subsection and more on what Agatha has ticked on the requests list. She’s a little bit proud of herself for reading Agatha so well in terms of what she might like. “You’ve written degradation play, collaring and leashing, and restraints as your interests,” she notes, but then her eyes track something else - a little note Agatha has added in the margins. She frowns, bemused. “No, actually, you’ve - you’ve added ‘necessary’ as a comment with an arrow pointing to restraints.”</p><p>Agatha glances up from where she’s been boredly swirling her glass of wine, studying the pale yellow liquid as if it holds the secrets of the universe. “Oh, you’ll have to tie me down if you want me to submit to you,” she explains casually.</p><p>Rio stares, trying to process that. “I <i>need</i> to tie you down?” she says, bewildered. “For you to… get into the correct headspace?” She’s not going to judge; she has another client who can only get into a submissive mindset by wearing a shiny amethyst princess plug.</p><p>“No, I will literally fight you if you don’t tie me up. And I mean entirely immobilised. I’ll claw your eyes out or try and bite you otherwise,” Agatha tells her, pursing her lips at the younger woman, and then, when she continues to look confused, complains, “Did I not explain in my email that I need to be physically wrestled into submission?”</p><p>That was written in Agatha’s first email, when she requested a dominatrix from the agency who would be happy to throw a sub to the floor and kick them into obedience. Rio asked for the job because she has enjoyed dealing with bratty subs in the past. But it doesn’t sound like Agatha is a brat. It sounds like she’s a <i>bitch</i>.</p><p>“I thought you meant that <i>figuratively</i>,” Rio says lamely.</p><p>“As if I would owe an ounce of respect to anyone who can’t tie a decent sailor's knot,” Agatha cackles. She grabs both of the now empty dirty wine glasses to rinse them in the sink, tossing over her shoulder offhandedly, “You’ll have to hit me too. Put your back into it. It’ll need to seriously hurt.”</p><p>“No impact play in the first session,” Rio replies on reflex. Impact play can get far too intense and escalate rapidly into a bad situation between a dom and sub that do not know each other very well yet.</p><p>“Yes, I caught that, but I presumed you meant like, spanking, or paddling. Or whipping.” Agatha returns to the breakfast bar, bracing herself against it on her forearms and tracing patterns within the marble countertop with her fingers absentmindedly. “If you want me to sub for you then you’ll have to slap me a couple of times at the start so I know where we stand.”</p><p>Rio blinks at her. What the <i>hell?</i> “If <i>I</i> want <i>you</i> to sub for - okay, time out.”</p><p>Agatha throws her arms up in the air, frustrated. “Knew you didn’t have it in you. Turn off the porch light for me on your way out?” She marches away into the living room, collapsing on the couch on her back and reaching for the TV remote.</p><p>Clearly, she’s sulking. But Rio is genuinely puzzled. Agatha is an utter mystery to her and every word that escapes her mouth just makes her even more fascinating and simultaneously perplexing.</p><p>She snags the TV remote and yanks it out of Agatha’s hand, towering above her. “I’m not leaving. I just want to understand. This is our time to negotiate, Miss Harkness, and you are giving me wildly conflicting vibes here,” Rio tells her gently. Agatha frowns unhappily, looking annoyed, but does sit back up. Rio steps back to take a seat in the armchair opposite, regarding her client seriously. “Do you even <i>want</i> to sub? This is a paid service. You will be paying me to dominate you. But it sounds to me as if you don’t even enjoy the idea of subbing.”</p><p>“It’s not wholly unpleasant if I can find the right dom,” Agatha responds airily, and then adds sarcastically, “One that actually can locate my G-spot, for example.”</p><p>Rio thinks she might be starting to understand now. Agatha is putting on a mask where she is pretending not to care about this process because she is scared of failure and rejection. She’s had bad experiences in the past with doms and is projecting her feelings onto Rio. Whatever she’s gone through, she’s been convinced that BDSM is only violent and sexual in nature, which is not the case.</p><p>“Pleasure should come from the act of submission itself, not just from the orgasms at the end,” Rio says. She settles back in her seat, crossing her legs and inspecting the woman in front of her, who has paid her a frankly obscene amount of money to be here tonight. She can tell that she is very gradually chipping away at Agatha’s stony, impassive persona, with her questions. “Why are you hiring me? What are you going to get out of this?” She raises a hand when Agatha’s mouth opens to give a quick answer. “And don’t say orgasms. That’s a given. I mean, what are you going to get out of this psychologically? Emotionally?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clicks closed. And then clenches. Her gaze drops to her lap and her brows furrow. For a fleeting moment, she looks conflicted, biting her lip as she appears to mentally debate what she should say. Finally, after a moment, she deflates, and admits, “My last girlfriend told me that I’m a bad sub and that I’m lying when I describe myself as a switch.”</p><p>Ahhh. Right, okay. That gives some important context to this situation. She imagines that Agatha was quite hurt and angry to have been told that. If she identifies as a switch, and somebody close to her offended her by accusing her of lying, and insulting her ability to submit, then that explains her reluctance to sub again, and why she might struggle to get into headspace.</p><p>“It’s fine if you aren’t. Some people aren’t suited to subbing or don’t like the role or mindset. You do give me more dominant vibes, to be honest,” Rio reasons, smiling encouragingly. “You don’t have to be a sub if you don’t want to.”</p><p>“I want to,” Agatha asserts, raising her chin in determination.</p><p>“So this is… what, your attempt at improving? You want to learn how to sub better?” Rio guesses.</p><p>Agatha chuckles at that, as if the idea of her having to work at <i>anything</i> to improve is laughable. Her tone is arrogant and cocksure as she declares, “No, I want to prove that I’m not a bad submissive - she was just an <i>abysmal</i> dominant.” She shuffles forward on the couch, leaning closer to Rio, her eyes glinting. “If somebody is going to make me get on their knees for them, I want them to fucking <i>earn</i> it first. I want to experience a good dominant, so I decided to hire a professional one. That way, when I start dating seriously again, I know what to look for.”</p><p>So… Agatha doesn’t think she is a difficult sub. She just thinks that no dom has been <i>worthy</i> of her submission, so far.</p><p>Huh. That’s actually pretty fair. Agatha is obviously a very proud and confident person, who holds a high position of power, earns a fuckton of money, and has a lot of self-respect. If she is going to give up control to somebody and trust them to take care of her - while also taking her down a couple of pegs - then she needs a dom who is her equal to do so. Everybody she has been in a relationship so far, whether that be romantic or sexual, has missed the mark, and Agatha will not lower her standards. Why should she?</p><p>Hiring a dominatrix to explore her submission some more is also a great way for Agatha to witness how a real, proper dom who is serious about BDSM should behave and conduct themself.</p><p>“That’s not… a terrible reason,” Rio says thoughtfully. She returns to the kitchen briefly to pick up her briefcase and also the contract, flipping through it. “Have you decided on a safeword?”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “Won’t need one.”</p><p>Rio snaps the contract closed, tossing it into Agatha’s lap. It lands with a thump, and her client looks irritated. But she’s not the only one who is displeased. “Yes, you will,” Rio tells her fiercely. If there is one thing that she is adamant about, it is the importance of safeword usage.  “Our contract stipulates that it is void and null if you do not pick one and utilize it as per our agreement on -”</p><p>“Page thirteen, yes, I know how to fucking read,” Agatha interrupts her, vexed. “I’ve never needed one before and I won’t need one now.”</p><p>Agatha will need one. She will definitely need one, because if she really does need to be handcuffed and fought into submission, tied up, hit, and physically beaten until she gives in to her headspace, then Rio <i>will</i> push her to the very edge until she’s on the verge of tapping out, to make her earn her orgasms.</p><p>Expressionless, Rio advises her flatly, “I will walk out right now and tell my colleagues to blacklist you, if you refuse to pick one.”</p><p>Agatha groans, tipping her head back against the cushions. “I’ll just tell you to stop if I want you to,” she grouses.</p><p>Why is she so resistant to choosing a word? It’s not hard. “You’re not taking this seriously.”</p><p>That accusation aggravates her client, and before Rio knows it, Agatha has risen to her feet and stalked over to loom above the dominatrix. A thunderous expression appears on her flushed face as she says darkly, “Oh, I assure you, I am being very serious about this whole affair. How many of your clients pay the full consultancy fee upfront?”</p><p>Rio’s mouth goes bone dry and arousal flares in her lower belly once again, seeing Agatha’s dilated pupils and hearing the huskiness in her voice. <i>None</i>, that’s the answer to Agatha’s question. The clients usually pay a 50% flat fee before she agrees to meet them for the first time, as a sort of deposit, and then they pay the rest after the consultancy. Agatha is the only one who has ever paid the full five thousand dollars immediately and without question.</p><p>And the lawyer knows it. She looks triumphant. “That’s what I thought.”</p><p>Rio slowly stands, slipping lithely around Agatha and circling her, so that they are now once again on the same level. “Your safeword cannot be ‘stop’,” she says.</p><p>“Why not?” Agatha argues, a slight whine in her tone.</p><p>Rio is going to enjoy listening to that whine in another context very soon. Agatha seems like the sort of person who will make a lot of noise during sex. She can’t wait to hear her desperate whimpers.</p><p>“Because a lot of people shout ‘stop’ when they don’t actually want me to stop. Sometimes ‘stop’ can mean ‘more’,” Rio clarifies. Cocking her head to the side musingly, Agatha acquiesces with a small nod. “Look, we’ll use the classic traffic light check-in system. Green for keep going, yellow for need a break or unsure about something, and red for immediate stop. But you need a separate safeword too.”</p><p>Agatha grumbles. “Alright, <i>fine</i>. If you <i>insist</i>, I’ll have a safeword.”</p><p>“So pick something. Anything, that you would not usually yell out during sex.”</p><p>“Okay then. My safeword is ‘safeword’.” She grins smugly, pleased to have beaten the system.</p><p>Rio cannot believe she is going to dominate this woman. And that she is going to be paid to do it. Honestly, she’s so looking forward to knocking her onto her knees, making her beg for mercy, and getting paid $5k a night to do so. Those big blue eyes are so expressive; they’ll look even more beautiful filled with tears once Rio has denied Agatha her orgasm for the third time.</p><p>“Is your password for everything also ‘password’?” she mutters.</p><p>“Of course not,” Agatha says, affronted.</p><p>“Is it ‘password’ with 123 or an exclamation point at the end?”</p><p>The older woman tosses her hair over her shoulders, examining her cuticles. “No, I just use those Safari suggested ones that come up and autofill for me.”</p><p>Rio gawks at her in horror. <i>Safari autofill passwords?</i> “Oh my god, you’re a psychopath,” she blurts out.</p><p>That makes the lawyer genuinely laugh. Oh, Rio should have known that her new client is a crazy person as soon as she said that she’s a criminal defense lawyer. “No, I just take the path of least resistance in life,” Agatha brags.</p><p>Rio smirks. “But not in bed.”</p><p>Huffing in annoyance, Agatha growls, “If you are implying that I’m a bad sub because I’m <i>lazy</i> -”</p><p>“I’m implying you’re a bad sub because you have no idea how to take control of your own body and set boundaries,” Rio cuts her off. What Agatha doesn’t know, or seem to understand, is that the way she has behaved tonight, towards Rio, by being argumentative and contradictory and refusing to state limits or choose a safeword, are marks of somebody who is… not <i>bad</i>, but not <i>suited</i> to submission.</p><p>“Isn’t that what a dom is meant to do?” she huffs.</p><p>Wait, Agatha thinks that the <i>dom</i> is the one who sets the limits? And takes control? A dom is <i>gifted</i> control by a sub, which by in large means that the sub has to have total control over themself, before they surrender it. And in BDSM relationships - or at least, the ones that Rio maintains - subs are the ones with the most power.</p><p>“I can see why you’re having issues now,” she murmurs.</p><p>Agatha picks up the contract from where she cast it aside onto the couch cushions, offering it to the dominatrix. “So are you in or are you out?” she demands.</p><p>Oh, she is 100% going to regret this. Agatha will undoubtedly make her question her domination techniques and be the most formidable, defiant, and contentious sub she’s ever dealt with. But Rio has been waiting a long time for a sub who makes her <i>work</i> for it. She reckons that domming Agatha might genuinely engage her in the best sex and most rewarding emotional release she’s experienced in years. For that reason, she is unfathomably excited.</p><p>“I’m in, to help you stick it to your ex,” she agrees. “And maybe you’ll learn how to actually sub properly with a proper dom.”</p><p>“Perfect.” Agatha beams at her, with a toothy, shit-eating grin. She looks like a cat who has just stolen a gallon of cream, rubbing her hands together eagerly. “Where do I sign?”</p><p>They both sit down next to each other on the couch and scribble out their signatures on all the necessary pages where there are dotted lines. Rio pauses every so often to clarify certain things with Agatha before she puts her pen to the page.</p><p>The contract is for five sessions, not including the consultancy; one every two weeks, which will escalate in intensity as the fortnights pass by. After that, they can negotiate a new contract if they wish, and that one can either be another short-term five session contract, or a long-term one that can last months or up to a year. Agatha assures her that she absolutely will have all the funds necessary to pay for the five sessions by providing proof in the form of bank account statements. Thirty thousand dollars is a drop in the ocean considering her savings, and Rio is not worried.</p><p>Rio will send her a document fully outlining her plans for each session at least 72 hours before the date. Negotiations will occur over text or email, and Agatha is free to disagree with any or all of her plans, and make suggestions of her own. Plans must be solidified at least 24 hours before the session and once they have been agreed upon by both parties, that is the end of the debate.</p><p>The one and only exception is in the case of last minute changes in plans (such as being suddenly invited to family dinner the next day and needing to be clear of marks and able to walk without limping) and unexpected injuries, like twisting an ankle or developing a bad back. In those cases, if she deems it safe to go forward with the session, Rio will alter the scene to accommodate.</p><p>But apart from that, Rio will have control of Agatha from the moment she enters the door on the day of the session, and Agatha must do anything and everything she orders, within the scope of the agreed plans. She can argue and whine and fight, but she has no further say, unless she safewords.</p><p>Aftercare is also discussed, which Rio emphasizes is non-negotiable; Agatha insists she will not need it, and never has in the past, so Rio reminds her that as her dom, she will have a duty of care, and part of that is taking care of her <i>after</i>. Agatha begrudgingly jots down a few things that she would like, such as being cleaned with a wet wipe, offered water, and being handfed snacks. She also seems a little embarrassed confessing to enjoying being cuddled as the little spoon, and having her hair played with and brushed, which Rio is all too gleeful to do for her.</p><p>In return, Agatha iterates that she is up for anything, including violence and more extreme methods of domination, but is uninterested in lifestyle BDSM; she will play the role of whore, slave, pet, whatever Rio wants, so long as there is a sexual component to it. Delayed gratification is fine - she’s all for it - so long as there is gratification at the end, and she’s fine if that stretches across sessions. She’s also indifferent to top/bottom/switching, which Rio is happy to hear, as it allows her to create some more dynamic scenes.</p><p>Once the final sections of the contract have been signed, Rio gives Agatha her phone number. Not her private, personal one, of course, but her work one. They exchange emergency contact details as the contract states, so that if a medical emergency occurs during one of their sessions, a trusted person can be contacted to help.</p><p>“That’s everything,” Rio confirms, sliding the fully signed contract into its protective wallet. She will go home tonight and scan it in to make a digital copy for the agency to keep on file, and also make two photocopies - one for herself and one for Agatha.</p><p>Appearing slightly dazed, or perhaps giddy, over the final signing of the contract, Agatha teases her in a sultry voice, “Do I call you Mistress now?”</p><p>She laughs. “Rio will do, unless you’d like to call me that, Miss Harkness?”</p><p>“Considering how much I’m paying for your services, I should be able to call you anything I want,” her client purrs. Her gaze sharpens, however, as she instructs Rio, “Call me Agatha. Miss Harkness is my mother, may she burn in hell for all eternity. No nicknames, no <i>Aggie</i>, no stupid little pet names.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio nods, loving how the syllables sound and feel in her mouth. It’s a delicious name, one that rolls around her tongue. She’s going to revel in drawing out that last vowel when giving orders to her new sub. “And I reserve the right to select a pet name or two for use during aftercare, but we can workshop which ones you’d prefer.” She tends to favor sweetheart, love, and darling, all charming and sweet rather than cutesy.</p><p>“So now this little consultancy sesh is over, do we take it to the bedroom?” Agatha asks slyly. “Not a scene, obviously, but to double-check our sexual compatibility?”</p><p>She plucks at the belt of her robe to loosen it at the top, sidling closer to Rio and humming as she tilts her head up ever so slightly, exposing the long length of her pale neck. She is shameless in her flirting, and Rio adores it.</p><p>She keeps her gaze fixed on Agatha’s face, even as she is tempted to glance down at her client’s prominent collarbones. “Nothing tonight. First session is always on the weekend, so you have time to recover before work,” she says, polite and professional. “I’ll book you in for Friday evening, if that suits you?”</p><p>Agatha looks a bit disappointed, but bobs her head in a nod. “I have court until 5, so it’ll have to be from 7 onwards.”</p><p>Nothing should be penciled in for that night yet. “That works. You’ll eat at least an hour before and won’t consume alcohol or any drugs prior. That includes any painkillers or anti-anxiety meds. Don’t feel like you have to do anything to prepare your body; in the first session you will be fully clothed,” Rio says, reciting her usual first session spiel. Agatha pouts like a puppy who’s been denied her treats upon hearing that clothes will be involved, batting those cerulean eyes at the dominatrix, as if she might be able to change her mind. Just because of that, Rio tags on, “And because I feel like you’ll enjoy the challenge of it, no touching yourself between now and then. Hands or toys.”</p><p>“Orgasm control and denial. Classic,” Agatha whistles. She takes a measured step back, tightening her robe belt, which draws the lapels back in and hides those wondrous collarbones that Rio can’t wait to get her mouth on in the future. “And what will you do if I disobey and have a little diddle before Friday? Will you punish me?” she challenges, wiggling her eyebrows.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio answers simply.</p><p>Agatha licks her lips, her eyes darkening. “Will I enjoy it?” she whispers.</p><p>Hearing the need in her client’s voice almost immediately causes Rio to sink into dom headspace. She has a sinking suspicion that she’s going to struggle to keep a level head around Agatha, even when they’re meant to be having normal dynamic conversations, because there is something about the older woman that makes Rio want to pin her to the floor by her throat and ravish her.</p><p>“Take a risk and find out, if you dare,” she replies in a low voice. “<i>But</i>, if you <i>do</i> listen to me, I’d reward you.”</p><p>A hitch in Agatha’s breathing, and she’s clearly getting worked up as she asks, “Oh? With what?”</p><p>“You’ll have to wait and see,” Rio tells her ominously, having not decided yet.</p><p>And… it’s the wrong answer. Because Agatha instantly emerges from the subby headspace she was slowly starting to descend into, curling her lip in disdain and crossing her arms moodily. Huh. “How do you expect me to be motivated to behave if I don’t know what I’m going to get out of it in the end?” she protests.</p><p>Okay. Note to self, no vague threats of punishment, or vague promises of rewards, Rio thinks. Agatha needs concrete, verbally established consequences. “Maybe I’m testing you. To see if you’re assertive and disciplined enough to restrain yourself,” she says steadily. “But I usually ensure that the first session is very, <i>very</i> pleasurable for my clients, so feel free to defy me - and displease me - and I’ll change my plans.”</p><p>“Pleasurable, without clothes being taken off?” Agatha raises a disbelieving eyebrow.</p><p>Oh, Rio is so thrilled she will have the opportunity in a few days to have this woman sitting in her lap, rutting against her leg to try and stimulate herself through her panties, and begging to come. And that will just be the start. Knowing what she does about Agatha now, she has a whole new host of ideas for how to make the experience even more painful and enjoyable for her.</p><p>“As I said, you’ll have to wait and see. But I’m a woman of my word,” she promises.</p><p>They wrap up for the evening, because Rio has to finish the paperwork and Agatha has her own work to finish off and prep notes to make for court. Courteous and as good a host as she is, Agatha escorts Rio to the front door, and even offers her an umbrella to borrow when they open it to reveal that it’s chucking it down with rain outside.</p><p>“Text me if you need to rearrange,” Rio tells her, hovering on the porch with her briefcase tucked beneath her arm. “I’m relatively flexible timings-wise.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Hesitating, the older woman adds, her voice achingly earnest, “You’ve made this whole negotiating process stress-free and very relaxing. It has reassured me that you know what you’re doing. And I’ll admit, when you sent me your details by email the other week, and I found out that you’re thirty-five, it did help with my nerves about your… level of experience.”</p><p>She suspects what the brunette is hinting at. “I know my way around a vagina, Agatha,” Rio laughs. “No maps with big fat red ‘X’s over the clit or G-spot will be required. If it’s any further reassurance, I’m also gay, and I exclusively accept female clients. As such, I am an expert when it comes to the ins and outs of lesbian sex. I’ve been doing this since I was twenty, so trust me, you will be in excellent hands.”</p><p>Agatha smirks and whispers theatrically, “Oh, I knew that as soon as I saw that you cut and clean your nails.”</p><p>Rio snickers. Of course, Agatha would notice that. “And you’ll soon find out why my college nickname was the cunnilingus connoisseur,” she boasts.</p><p>“Can’t wait. I’ll see you Friday,” the lawyer says, longing and desire shining in her eyes as she leans against the door frame.</p><p>“Friday,” Rio nods with a grin.</p><p>She hurries to the car as the rain hammers down, managing to slip inside without getting too wet, and shoving the drenched umbrella in the back seat before it can drip all over her. The briefcase and the valuable contract contained within it go back into the passenger footwell, and Rio digs out a Coke Zero and granola bar from the glovebox to refuel for her hour’s drive back home.</p><p>That might have been the most interesting consultancy meeting with a client that she has ever had. Agatha Harkness might be one of the most intriguing people she has ever met, and will have the pleasure to dom for.</p><p>However, she knows that this is not going to be an easy ride. She needs to tread cautiously, and plan rigorously. It might take several sessions before Agatha feels like Rio deserves her respect and surrenders enough to enter subspace. If she ever even manages to get there, because Rio has to confess… she kind of suspects that Agatha’s asshole ex is right.</p><p>The lawyer can call herself a switch, but from their conversations tonight, Rio got major dom energy from her. She doesn’t want Agatha to <i>force</i> herself to submit, but if she <i>can</i> and is <i>willing</i>, then Rio will make it worth it. Well, certainly worth the thirty grand that Agatha will ultimately end up paying her.</p><p>Agatha is going to be one hell of a difficult woman to tame, and Rio can already tell that she is going to have to be on top form to earn her submission.</p><p>If that’s even possible.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio arrives at Agatha’s house early, suspecting that her new client is not someone who would tolerate tardiness. The darkness is encroaching on the mellow evening sky, creating a glare through her Mini’s windows that fortunately does not bother Rio, who is wearing sunglasses. She’s turned the heating up to maximum as the cold Atlantic wind has swept inland over the past few days, so a biting chill hangs in the air.</p><p>She’s brought a backpack this time, rather than a briefcase, as she’s got a lot more equipment to carry inside. Agatha’s photocopy of the contract is tucked into the laptop pocket, but is pretty much buried beneath coils of rope, packets of dental dams, and a clear plastic case containing various types of lube, bruise balms, and soothing creams. Rio has always believed in overpreparing, just in case.</p><p>She honestly has no clue if the dental dams will even be needed; the lawyer made a point of asking for proof of her being clean earlier in the week, and just this morning sent Rio an updated medical document confirming that she was tested on Tuesday for STIs and came back clear. At least neither of them has to be concerned with birth control; one of the main benefits of being lesbians is that they can fuck like crazy and not ever worry about getting pregnant.</p><p>Pulling out her work phone, Rio opens her and Agatha’s messages to read over them one last time. If there’s one thing Rio has learned from the past week of communication between them, it’s that Agatha is not just going to be a difficult sub - she is a <i>demanding</i> one.</p><p>When Rio sent her the first draft of her scene plan on Tuesday night, Agatha responded with pages of notes. She was taken aback, because she’d never had a client do that before. But Agatha seems to know what she wants and what she likes, so Rio made the appropriate alterations, and after swapping the scene plan back and forth several times, they finally constructed a final version by Thursday morning.</p><p>The one, singular thing that Agatha absolutely refused to relent on was her desire - no, her <i>requirement</i> - to be literally beaten into submission. Rio tried desperately not to give in to her, adamant that her ‘no impact play in the first session’ rule should stand strong.</p><p>But Agatha was open and considerate of all of Rio’s requests and suggestions - even Rio’s appeal to utilize some pet names, despite her hating them - and so Rio admitted defeat. She included hitting and kicking as part of the degradation play. She’s just going to have to be incredibly cautious and dial into her sub’s responses and emotions, reading her body language at all times.</p><p>The importance of being constantly alert and present in the scene is another reason why she has driven up to Westview early. Rio may work as a dominatrix, but she’s a switch. Within her own personal and romantic relationships, she actually much prefers to sub. It can therefore sometimes take her a good ten to twenty minutes to steady her mind and get into the correct dominant headspace before she meets with her clients.</p><p>She has a routine figured out down to the ‘T’ at this point, whereby she meditates, reads over the SparkNotes version of the scene plane again and again until she has it memorized, and then talks to herself during the drive over, slipping into her more commanding, authoritative dom voice and practicing phrases until they feel natural and she’s not blushing like a mortified school girl.</p><p>It’s also vital that she takes a moment to release any and all negative emotions that have built up throughout the day. It would be utterly irresponsible for her to enter a scene with a sub whilst feeling frustrated or upset or angry, because she would risk taking those feelings out on her unsuspecting and innocent sub, which would be abusive.</p><p>Steeling herself, Rio bows her head and takes several long, deep measured breaths. Agatha Harkness is her sub, and however much she fights and screams and complains, she <i>wants this</i>, she tells herself. Violent scenes can be disturbing for her to perform, but Rio always reminds herself that it is exactly that - <i>a scene</i>. It’s not real. It’s acting. However frightening the scene becomes as it develops, it has been fully planned out and Agatha consented to everything. And Rio is not a bad person if she enjoys knocking her down a few pegs, because it’s what Agatha wants.</p><p>Turning the engine of her car off, Rio grabs her backpack and the rest of her belongings and exits the vehicle. She sends her safety texts to her colleagues as she strolls up to Agatha’s front door, giving herself a cursory glance over as she does so. She chose to wear a pine green flowery lace body suit with large cutouts on the sides to expose her ribs; the best part about it is that it’s technically not a full body leotard and is two parts: top and bottom, held together by invisible snaps at the sides. It means that Rio can shed the bottom half whenever she likes - when she’s sitting on Agatha’s face, for example.</p><p>She’s covered herself with a stretchable black midi dress that she knows from experience only takes seconds to remove. Standard black heels adorn her feet which she’ll toss into the corner as soon as she steps inside Agatha’s house. Her favorite emerald green overcoat does very little to shield her from the wind. Her dark hair, which has been tied up in a sleek ponytail, swings in the breeze.</p><p>She only has to knock once before the door is wrenched open, and Agatha stares at her in abject relief, looking incredibly flustered. Rio blinks rapidly, speechless, because her client is wrapped in a <i>fucking towel</i>, and <i>only</i> a towel, and looks like she’s freshly emerged from the shower.</p><p>Who the hell has the balls to answer the front door wearing <i>only a towel?</i></p><p>Agatha Harkness. That’s who.</p><p>Hell, Agatha would probably go for a stroll around her neighborhood naked and not give a single fuck who sees her.</p><p>“Oh, great, you’re here,” Agatha greets her, breathless. “I need your help upstairs, I haven’t decided what to wear yet.”</p><p>Rio is immediately thrown. “You - Agatha, the agreement was that as soon as I step through this door, I have complete and utter control over you. You give me a signal and then the scene begins,” she reminds her slowly.</p><p>“Yes, yes, I know, but I can’t decide what to wear,” Agatha replies dismissively, waving her hand. The movement causes her towel to slip slightly, exposing much more of her cleavage than Rio planned to see whilst standing on her client’s porch. “I have two outfits picked out but I thought as my dom you might like to have the final say.”</p><p>She wiggles her eyebrows seductively, beckoning her inside with a lone finger. But Rio doesn’t move, alarmed. This is not going how she thought it would. They did <i>not</i> discuss her helping Agatha choose lingerie. Yes, that <i>is</i> a service that she provides, and she has done it for many subs in the past. Some of her past subs have requested that Rio chooses <i>all</i> of their outfits, in fact. Agatha did not ask for that; she showed no interest in it. Rio <i>can</i> improvise, but right off the bat?</p><p>She’s beginning to think that there was no point in making a scene plan. Agatha is just going to throw the entire thing out the window, the first chance she gets.</p><p>The lawyer groans dramatically upon seeing her conflicted hovering. “If you’re that much of a stickler for the rules, you can just hang out here. I’ll bring the outfits down, you can choose one, and then you don’t have to come in until I’ve changed.”</p><p>That’ll take at least ten minutes, and Rio is already starting to shiver. “It’s freezing!” she protests.</p><p>“You’re wearing a coat, aren’t you?” Agatha scoffs. “Toughen up, you’re a <i>New Yorker</i>.” Rio opens her mouth to correct her that she’s Puerto Rican, actually, but doesn’t get the chance; the single finger Agatha was using to call Rio inside raises to her lip, as she narrows her eyes and scans the younger woman up and down with a loud, thoughtful hum. “That coat looks way too expensive to end up on my bedroom floor, by the way,” she comments.</p><p>“Because it won’t. I’m not going to throw myself at you and haul you into bed the second I cross the threshold. I’m gonna hang my coat up and do a check-in first,” Rio sighs. She lapses into silence, waiting for Agatha to sweep aside and let her in. Agatha, on the other hand, remains planted in the doorway, waiting for her to agree, because the lawyer can’t seem to fathom that Rio <i>won’t</i>. They are at an impasse. And Rio may be a dom, but she’s also technically Agatha’s employee right now. Groaning, she runs her hand down her face. “... Alright, go get changed. I’ll wait.”</p><p>Agatha beams at her. And then slams the door in her face.</p><p>Rio cannot believe this is happening.</p><p>She is meant to be dominating this woman and yet she feels like with Agatha, she’s always on the back foot.</p><p>Across the street, a neighbor opens their creaky door to take the trash out. They spot her awkwardly standing on Agatha’s porch and raise a hand to say hello. Knowing that she looks like a weirdo just lurking outside a single woman’s house, Rio waves back. Thankfully, she’s not easily humiliated and has the patience of a saint.</p><p>When Agatha opens up the door again, she has an outfit in each hand on hangers. One is a crimson body suit that has too many slits to count, including one directly above the vagina, which means it barely hides anything. The other is a rich purple sheer corset bra with a matching thong. The lawyer holds them both, completely shameless and not caring that any of her neighbors could easily glance through their windows and catch a glimpse at her lingerie collection. Rio is both impressed and horrified.</p><p>“Red or purple?” Agatha asks her curiously. “The red one is crotchless, but the purple one has a proper ribbed corset, which I’m more inclined to choose.”</p><p>She is genuinely looking for Rio’s opinion. “I told you to wear proper clothes for tonight,” she says helplessly.</p><p>Agatha responds with a smile that is all bared teeth, her eyes gleaming dangerously. “These are proper clothes.”</p><p>“<i>Barely</i>. Proper clothes won’t get you arrested like those would if you were out in public.”</p><p>“Oh hush, these would be perfectly fine to wear at a beach, or a swimming pool.”</p><p>“I don’t think parents would be very pleased if their kids saw your bush peeking out of that red one and your boobs spilling out the top of the purple one.”</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Agatha wiggles her fingers, gesturing at her coat. “What color are you wearing? I texted earlier and you didn’t say. I don’t want us to clash.”</p><p>So she’s worried about their outfits clashing, but not at all concerned that her whole street might see her showing off two sets of shockingly scanty lingerie to a woman on her doorstep? God, Rio can’t wait to have Agatha screaming and writhing on her lap later to make her feel as vulnerable as she currently feels.</p><p>Agatha is waiting for her answer.</p><p>“Green,” she reluctantly admits.</p><p>“Right, I’ll put the purple on then,” Agatha decides. “And, since you are <i>so insistent</i> on me wearing ‘proper clothes’ I’ll put on leggings and a top too, okay? Give me five minutes.” She pauses and adds, “You’re beginning to look a bit limp in the cold, and I don't want you getting hypothermia before you get the chance to fuck me, so you can step inside.”</p><p>Rio is too grateful to be spared from another five minutes of awkwardly loitering outside the house, freezing her ass off, to care that Agatha is reversing their dynamic and giving her orders right now. The lawyer vanishes up the stairs to where her bedroom must be to change. Once she’s inside and waiting in the warm foyer, Rio forces herself to focus once again, trying very hard to slip back into dominant headspace and concentrate on the scene plan. She can get this night back on the rails.</p><p>Shedding her coat, she hangs it up on a peg nearby, smoothing her hands down her dress as she toes off her heels. She piles them underneath the corner table, where Agatha’s own boots and running sneakers are thrown in a haphazard heap. Picking through her backpack’s contents, Rio fishes out the copy of the contract and slides it onto that corner table, so Agatha can file it later.</p><p>Soft, barely audible footsteps announce her client’s return. She has indeed changed into the purple set of lingerie, from what Rio can tell, but is also wearing a slim pair of black leggings and a lilac crop-top, that rides just high enough that the ribbed corset section of her bra peeks through. Agatha’s tousled brunette hair has been left loose, as Rio requested, and her face is mostly devoid of make-up, so that if (when) she cries later, it won’t stain anything. In this state, raw and natural, she still looks just as beautiful as she did on Monday.</p><p>“You look lovely,” Rio tells her truthfully.</p><p>Agatha preens smugly. “I know I do,” she says, lifting her chin.</p><p>Rio shifts back and forth, rocking on the balls of her heels. They stipulated in the scene plan that they wouldn’t start the actual scene itself until Agatha gave the green light. A couple of her subs do like to make some light conversation before things get heavy. She didn’t think Agatha would be one for dilly-dallying, but maybe she would like a short conversation to ease the tension beforehand, and increase their familiarity with each other. They are still essentially strangers, after all - strangers who are about to have extremely violent sex.</p><p>From everything she’s learned about Agatha, Rio knows that she enjoys being the center of attention, and loves talking about herself. “How was work today? Anything eventful happen in court?” she asks. “Get anybody out of going to prison, even though they absolutely deserve it?”</p><p>She googled Agatha the morning after meeting her for their consultancy; she’s not a criminal defense lawyer who defends murderers or rapists or people who have hurt others. It appears that she tends to defend nonviolent people who have committed white-collar crimes, like money laundering or tax evasion. And typically, she ‘wins’ not by getting them out of jail or off the hook, but by negotiating shorter sentences, or fines.</p><p>Agatha dusts off an imaginary piece of lint from her shoulder. “I can’t discuss an ongoing active case,” she replies in a flippant tone, her lips turning up subtly.</p><p>“Judging by that smirk I assume it’s a case that’s going well for you,” Rio teases, following her client as she leads her into the living room.</p><p>“You’ll see it in the news when the sentencing is announced,” the lawyer informs her with a pompous, self-satisfied smile. She remains on her feet as she offers Rio a sealed bottle of water. She tucks it into her backpack to drink later. “Best part was that I got to expose a rich corporate jackass as a cheating scumbag using his alibi. Men are so stupid. I’ll have the chance to give a riveting speech of triumph in front of a dozen cameras and increase my fees by two hundred dollars an hour.”</p><p>She sighs dreamily, as if she can’t imagine anything better than extorting her criminal clients for insane amounts of money to defend them in court and humiliate them at the same time. Honestly, it sounds sort of scummy - and scammy.</p><p>“Have you eaten?” Rio checks. Agatha seems like the sort of person who would often forget to eat or drink while buried in work, and as her dom, Rio doesn’t want her passing out halfway through their session from low blood sugar or dehydration.</p><p>Cracking her own bottle of water open to take a few swigs, Agatha wipes stray droplets of water off her face with her forearm. “Yes, an hour ago, as you requested. I’ve hydrated, not touched a drop of wine, and the only drugs I took today were paracetamol for a headache and my usual Adderall,” she recites.</p><p>The attitude which she injects into her tone is indicative of her being annoyed by the rules. She’s likely used to having a drink on Friday evenings to wind down after work. Taking any sort of depressant can be dangerous for a BDSM scene, though. It slipped Rio’s mind that Agatha mentioned on her application form that she has ADHD and takes 10mg of Adderall daily for it. But she passed the agency’s medical intake evaluation, so it isn’t any of Rio’s business.</p><p>“So when are you taking that dress off?” Agatha asks, her eyes darkening. “You know what I’m wearing. I showed you mine, now you show me yours?”</p><p>Squaring her shoulders, Rio shakes any of the remaining tension out of her arms and shoulders, loosening up for what will inevitably be a very physically demanding evening. She grasps hold of her dress by its hem and lifts it in a fluid motion over her head, deftly folding the fabric in her arms and dropping it on the couch.</p><p>Rio is well aware that she is a beautiful woman, by most metrics. It’s always nice to be reminded of how attractive she is, however, as Agatha rakes her ravenous gaze over her, her eyes becoming black lustful pools as her pupils dilate. The lawyer looks as if she’s ready to devour her whole, her fingers twitching by her sides, as if she’s resisting the urge to touch her.</p><p>“You remember the scene plan?” Rio asks her cautiously. “And the limits we established? You remember the rules?”</p><p>“Yes, yes, I have an eidetic memory, I remember everything. I remember all of the lines in all of the places I’m not allowed to cross.”</p><p>“Ready now, then?” the dominatrix questions, quirking an eyebrow.</p><p>“More than ready,” Agatha murmurs concupiscently. “Or, green, if that’s what you need to hear.”</p><p>Oh, it’s precisely what Rio wants to hear. It’s the signal she’s been waiting for, and straightening her spine, she stalks forward toward her sub, nearly vibrating with excitement. Agatha is hers for the night, and she can’t wait to break her apart.</p><p>Oblivious to Rio’s shift into her dominant role, Agatha continues to blabber on as the younger woman begins to hungrily circle her, like a lioness assessing her prey. “The traffic light system is really going to drag down our dirty talk. I’ve been thinking over the last couple of days and there must be a better way to -”</p><p>Rio can only guess that her client is rambling because she wants to be interrupted and put in her place, so whilst she’s standing behind Agatha, she lashes out with her leg - kicking Agatha in the back of the knees, so they’re knocked out from beneath her. She yelps and crashes down onto all-fours, palms smacking against the wooden floor loudly.</p><p>“Ow! The hell was that for!?” she scowls, rubbing her sore hands with a wince.</p><p>Rio wraps her hand in Agatha’s hair from behind, twisting it into a ponytail and yanking. Her head wrenches backward and she gasps at the pain of the sudden pressure on her scalp, as she stares up into Rio’s eyes, stunned. “Shut the fuck up and get on your <i>fucking knees</i>, you whore,” she snarls.</p><p>“Christ, it’s zero to a hundred with you, then?” Agatha breathes, releasing a moan when Rio twists her hair again, increasing the tension. It puts a strain on the older woman’s neck and forces her to thrust her hips forward and arch her back. “We’re not even gonna make small talk about the weather or - I don’t know, <i>sports?</i>” Rio gets the feeling that Agatha does not know a single damn thing about sports. “I despise small talk with every fiber of my being, so you won’t hear complaints from me, but damn, you couldn’t have given me a warning? My knees might never recover.”</p><p>Confused, Rio lets go. She cups Agatha’s forehead to keep her head in place, without any of the pain associated with pulling her hair. What is she talking about, not receiving warning? <i>She</i> is the one who signaled her to start the scene.</p><p>“You said you were ready. You said green,” she says, her voice coming out an admonishing growl as she tries to stay in dominant headspace.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth drops open and then she purses her lips with a small nod. “Oh. I can see how you might have taken that as a ‘let’s get started now’ signal. My bad,” she replies breezily. <i>My bad?</i> This woman cannot be real. The lawyer nudges her head back into Rio’s hands and shuffles her knees apart into a more submissive kneeling stance on the floor. “Carry on, good show-<i>OWWWW</i>.”</p><p>Rio cuts her off mid-sentence by slapping her. It’s what Agatha requested, after all. She hits hard enough that Agatha’s face jerks to the side and her cheek is left a flushed pretty pink. She circles back around to face her sub from the front, and when Agatha peers up at her, she looks dazed and awed. The sharp pain has instantly subdued her. Wonderful. <i>That’s</i> what she wants to see.</p><p>Gripping her chin, Rio bends down to purr, “You are <i>mine</i> for the night, and if a <i>single</i> word escapes that pretty mouth of yours without my permission, I’ll put a vibrator clip on your clit, torture your cunt without letting you come until you’re a sobbing puddle, and then make you lick your mess up from the floor.”</p><p>Agatha blinks slowly at her, like a big cat expressing affection. She’s so turned on that she’s already beginning to squirm, trying to rub her thighs together. “... That’s meant to encourage me to keep my mouth shut? Don’t threaten me with a good time, hun,” she jokes.</p><p>Okay, so… not quite in a submissive enough mindset, yet. To help her along, Rio slaps her again, this time with so much force that it causes her to lose balance and collapse on her right side.</p><p>“Oh god, yes, hit me harder,” Agatha wheezes, shuddering and reaching out to clutch at Rio’s leg.</p><p>She hits her again. This time, Rio makes sure that the blow lands a bit harder, enough to leave a lasting sting and maybe leave her a bit dizzy. She’s trying her best to keep control of her strength so that it hurts, as her client wishes it to, but won’t cause her any sort of long-term damage or rattle her brain in its skull. Rio would be a pretty terrible dominant if she left Agatha with a raging concussion after this scene.</p><p>Agatha is <i>still</i> displeased with her effort though, even though she will definitely be parading around with a bruised cheek in the morning. “C’mon, Rio, harder. I can tell you’re holding back with these pathetic slaps,” the lawyer grouches. “I’m paying for a premium experience here, shouldn’t I be getting premium punches?”</p><p><i>Pathetic?</i> The fucking audacity of this woman! If she hits her any harder, she’s going to knock her out. “<i>SHUT UP</i>,” she yells, pressing her bare foot into Agatha’s shoulder to roll her onto her back. Her arms end up trapped beneath her spine.</p><p>Rio keeps her foot planted there to keep her pinned, pressing her weight down so that there’s no chance of Agatha freeing her arms. Seeing her sub lying sedately on the floor, breathing raggedly and writhing beneath her, causes a flare of burning warmth to erupt in her lower belly.</p><p>Her position gives Agatha a direct view up between her legs at her core, hidden from sight by her body suit. “Please tell me I’ll get to take that off you at some point tonight,” Agatha whispers hoarsely. “I wanna eat you out <i>so bad</i>.”</p><p>Rio growls thunderously at her and shifts her foot to Agatha’s face, shoving the side of her head down against the floorboards. “Did I say you could talk? The only words you are allowed to say are your traffic lights, your safeword, yes and no. Otherwise, all I want to hear are your slutty little moans,” she hisses.</p><p>She releases her, stepping across so she’s standing with her feet on either side of Agatha’s heaving chest. If she had her whip in hand, she would be trailing it across her face and down her very, <i>very</i> red throat. But Rio knew she would be too tempted if she were to incorporate it into their scene today, when no impact play is allowed. Agatha might try and goad her into using it.</p><p>“You don’t come until I give you permission. Understand?” she demands.</p><p>Agatha swallows. “Yes,” she squeaks. The degradation, the orders, and being towered over are definitely helping her sink into subspace. Rio is beginning to think that the woman was exaggerating when she said that she makes her doms earn her submission, because Agatha has rolled over to show her belly all too easily for her.</p><p>“Good girl,” she praises her.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widen and every prevailing trace of sky blue iris disappears from her eyes as they grow black with pure desire. A needy whine tears from her throat and she rubs her thighs together more desperately. Rio is taken aback but overjoyed, crouching down to trace her fingertips over her sub’s red cheeks. She’s overcome with the urge to kiss her, even though their contract states that it’s completely off-limits.</p><p>“Oh, you like that, huh, sweetheart? You like being called good girl? Does my adorable desperate whore have a praise kink?” she coos. Another yearning whimper escapes Agatha’s mouth. She draws her hand back, and even though just a minute ago it was slapping her, Agatha chases her touch, desperate for her tender caresses. “Verbal answer, Agatha,” she prompts.</p><p>“Yes,” her sub whispers.</p><p>“Useful information,” Rio comments aloud musingly.</p><p>Praise kinks are extremely common in submissives, and make it practically effortless to train and condition them to a dom’s standards. So far, Agatha is proving a relatively facile, docile sub to deal with. Time to take this to the bedroom.</p><p>Withdrawing and stepping away, Rio slings her backpack onto her shoulder. “Stand,” she orders.</p><p>Agatha’s biddability vanishes into thin air, and she raises her head with an aggravated, irritated expression. “First you order me to kneel, then kick me to the ground, and now you want me to stand? Make up your mind, Rio,” she huffs.</p><p>“<i>Agatha</i>,” she says warningly.</p><p>The older woman tilts her head. “Yes?”</p><p>Rio kicks her. And keeps kicking her, enjoying Agatha’s startled yips and annoyed noises as she scrambles up onto her knees. “I was going to gift you the privilege of walking up the stairs on two feet. Now you’re going to crawl. Take me to your bedroom,” she commands.</p><p>Agatha crosses her arms over her chest sulkily, averting her eyes. She’s such a fucking brat. Rio seizes a handful of her silky hair, wresting her head up until her sub is forced to make eye contact with her.</p><p>She revels in the shock and lust on Agatha’s face as she roars furiously, “<i>CRAWL, BITCH!</i>”</p><p>“<i>Yesma’am</i>,” the lawyer slurs, abruptly dropping back into subspace.</p><p>Rio smirks. She was not expecting to hear Agatha use that term of address for her, but she doesn’t dislike it. Easing her hand free from her sub’s messy hair, she bends over to stroke it smooth. “Green?” she checks in a whisper.</p><p>Leaning into Rio’s palm, Agatha hums, her eyes fluttering. “The most viridescent chartreuse you could possibly imagine,” she croaks.</p><p>She nods, satisfied, and then gives her a firm slap on her behind. “Get to it, then.”</p><p>Agatha obeys her order and crawls like a cowering puppy up the stairs, with Rio calmly following along behind her. The view of her ass is frankly incredible, and Rio very briefly contemplates the thought of abandoning their venture into the bedroom and taking her apart from behind on the stairs. She could rip the stitching on Agatha’s leggings, pull aside her thong and bury her fingers in her pussy, forcing Agatha to rut against a step to get traction. But she’s planning to make her come multiple times, and the stairs are far too hazardous a location for that.</p><p>As they ascend the steps, the dominatrix makes mental notes on everything she has just witnessed from Agatha during the first act of their scene. The one and only thing she is majorly concerned about is the swiftness with which Agatha enters and exits subspace. A dom can be seduced by a sub’s rapid obedience, their ego boosted by their ability to send their sub spiraling into headspace within minutes of having them under their thumb. But Rio knows that it’s not a good sign.</p><p>Subspace can significantly affect a submissive's ability to communicate and interpret their limits because it can detach them from reality; it’s essentially a form of very light dissociation that leaves them feeling all happy and fuzzy. But that disorientation can be dangerous, especially when the sub has requested violent play like Agatha has, because it can alter their pain perception and tolerance.</p><p>For now, Rio thinks she’s only observed her client enter light subspace, but if she gets any deeper, and is <i>still</i> struggling to remain within it, then she foresees an issue. It’s not something that can be rapidly switched on and off. Just like turning a light switch on and off frequently can shorten the life of a lightbulb and cause it to burn out faster, a sub falling and rising out of subspace too many times within a singular scene can make them lose stamina. <i>Fast.</i></p><p>Agatha pauses at the closed door of what must be her bedroom, whimpering quietly under her breath as she waits for Rio to reach her. She doesn’t seem to want to enter first, and Rio narrows her eyes, wondering why. She files it away for later, and turns the handle, edging inside and turning the lights on as she glances around searchingly.</p><p>Agatha’s bedroom is not as minimalist and modern as the rest of her home. The walls are white, but the far one is wallpapered with a dark navy celestial pattern, with gold-accented moons, suns, and constellations. There are ebony wood cabinets and a built-in closet with mirrored doors, and there’s a fucking crystal <i>chandelier</i> instead of a regular lampshade.</p><p>The large queen-sized bed in the center is what captures Rio’s attention, however. “Black sheets,” she comments, turning back to the lawyer, who is kneeling in the doorway with her head angled down and eyes on the floor. “God, you really are an insatiable dirty slut, aren’t you, Agatha? Did you put these on your bed in the hopes of getting them all soaking wet when I make you squirt so hard you pass out?” she leers. “Or when you piss yourself from the pain when I slap that dripping pussy later?”</p><p>The dirty talk triggers Agatha to start shivering all over, goosebumps appearing on her skin. Rio snaps her fingers and points to the floor next to her, and like a dog eager to obey its master, Agatha’s hands skitter over the floor as she rushes to her side. The blush decorating her cheeks is so charming that Rio softens at the sight and paired with Agatha’s wet, adoring eyes, she knows that she’s a goner. She wants Agatha on this stupid bed with the stupid black sheets, quaking as orgasms rip through her like earthquakes, sobbing and crying out Rio’s name.</p><p>She turns the bed down, chucking the faux fur throw to the side and folding the comforter so it’s tucked down by the end of the bed. As she’s doing so, Rio briefly turns her back to Agatha for maybe a millisecond - but that’s enough for her control over her sub to shatter.</p><p>Agatha springs to her feet with a gasp. “Oh, you have a tattoo!” she exclaims in delight, submissive haze once again <i>gone</i>, leaving Rio groaning in despair.</p><p>God, why can’t Agatha just get down and <i>stay down?</i> She jumps in surprise when she feels the lawyer tracing the lines and shapes that begin at the nape of her neck, which are just visible above the swoop of her body suit. Without an ounce of shame, Agatha tries to pry the fabric away to get a closer look at the ink that blankets her entire back.</p><p>She can feel Agatha’s fingers skidding over her skin where she knows her raven’s feathers lie. The wings spread over her shoulder blades and shadow the nightshades, chrysanthemums, ivy, and asphodel blooms that trickle down her spine.</p><p>Rio wheels around and snags hold of Agatha’s wrists, grasping them firmly together. She <i>needs</i> to take back control of her sub before this situation gets out of hand. “<i>Stop</i>,” she orders.</p><p>Agatha ignores her. “Will you let me lick it?” she asks, her eyes alight with excitement. “I’ve always wondered if the skin feels different because of the scarring -”</p><p>Having heard enough already, and getting frustrated that Agatha seems to not be <i>trying</i> to stay down in subspace at all whenever Rio manages to get her there, she twists the lawyer’s arm and spins her until she’s pressed up against the mattress, secured in a hammerlock hold. It’s one Rio learned ages ago at college during a self-defense class, and is the best move she knows for when she needs to wrestle an unruly sub down onto their belly.</p><p>She listed it in the scene plan as a method she would use to subdue Agatha if she got too yappy, which her client signed off on. Despite that, she squawks in pain and protest.</p><p>“Ow ow ow ow! What was that for?!” Agatha whinges.</p><p>Rio loosens her grip just so that when the older woman turns over and stands, mouth contorted into a sneer, she can lunge forward and grasp her firmly around the throat. No breath play allowed, so she applies absolutely no pressure at all, but just the <i>feeling</i> of having her throat clasped is enough to stun Agatha, who stares at her with eyes as round as plates, her breath stuttering.</p><p>“Your hand is around my neck right now - does that not count as breath play?” Agatha manages to rasp, challenging her. “Thought that was off the table?”</p><p>“Stop talking. Do you need me to stick my fingers down your throat and make you gag on them? I’ll do it until you throw up,” Rio spits at her. Agatha grimaces upon hearing that threat, adverse to the idea of that particular body fluid being involved in their play. “Get on the bed. On your front. I’m going to tie you to it and then our night will properly begin.”</p><p>As soon as Agatha’s throat is released, and she has her voice back, she pouts and sharply responds, “No.”</p><p>Rio knew this was coming. Agatha did warn her that she would need to be fought to get her tied up, after all. “No, huh? Want to be difficult? We can do this the easy way or the hard way, sweetie,” she says, her voice mocking and cruel. She likes to think of herself as a relatively soft dom, stern and blunt but not unkind, but she’s not afraid to be punitive when it’s required. “Lie down on your front on that mattress in the next three seconds or I’ll make you, and I won’t be gentle.”</p><p>Agatha bares her teeth, bristling. “I don’t wanna lie face down.” Her darkened eyes flicker up and down Rio’s form once again, and she wets her lips with her little pink tongue, biting her bottom one. “I want to see you. I want to watch you. I want to lie on my back instead.”</p><p>Laughing derisively, Rio gives her a mighty shove. She’s so close to the edge of the bed that she immediately stumbles and falls back onto it, winded, and her legs splayed out provocatively. “I think you’re forgetting your place, Agatha. You are <i>not</i> the dom in this scene. I am. <i>You</i> are the sub. You don’t have <i>wants</i>. So long as I’m here, you do what I say, and what I want,” Rio tells her fiercely.</p><p>She sees Agatha begin to draw her legs up close to her torso, curling them beneath her, so she reacts; she grabs her ankles and yanks her to the end of the bed. Agatha’s cloth-covered core collides with Rio’s stomach, her thighs bracketing her waist, and the gargling sound that emerges from her gaping mouth is guttural and utterly depraved. The leggings that Agatha is wearing over the top of her thing are paper thin - so thin that Rio can see how wet she is just from their foreplay.</p><p>She grins wickedly when Agatha tries to hump up against her abdomen to get more pressure on her clit, eyes rolling back in her head; pushing on the back of her thighs, she forces Agatha’s legs up so that her cunt also points upwards. It means she can no longer push up against anything for friction against that sensitive bundle of nerves. Agatha slaps the mattress with a clenched fist, emitting a shout of frustration.</p><p>“You, my dear, are just a needy fucktoy for me to use and play with at my leisure,” Rio whispers, leaning in closer so that Agatha can feel her hot breath dance across her cheeks. “I don’t give a flying fuck about your opinion.” She backs off, letting go of Agatha’s legs. They flop down and hang limply off the bed. “Now <i>lie down on your fucking front</i>.”</p><p>Agatha shoots upright. She looks outraged. Perhaps it wasn’t the best move to tease her, but Rio is shaking in anticipation for the mini battle she knows is about to occur between them. She fully believes now that Agatha is a switch, because she’s seen that she has the ability to sub - when she’s willing to - but she is also clearly trying to challenge Rio’s dominance. Rio is all too ready to defend it.</p><p>“<i>No</i>,” Agatha snarls, climbing off the bed and getting right up in her dom’s face, jaw set. If Rio weren’t so securely locked into dominant headspace right now, she might slip a little, seeing the azure fire in the older woman’s gaze. “I don’t want to.”</p><p>“The hard way it is,” Rio nods, with a demented laugh.</p><p>She strikes first, stealing the role of the aggressor; she tries to tackle Agatha onto the bed and get her restrained with her arms behind her back. But Agatha, the wild, untamable creature that she is, claws and screeches, wriggling out of her hold and throwing herself off the mattress onto the floor; she attempts to flee on all fours, scrabbing for the door, but Rio jumps off the bed after her, tangling her hand in Agatha’s hair and wrenching her backward.</p><p>The shriek that erupts is genuinely agonized, but Agatha does not safeword, and so Rio carries on. Her cunt is throbbing between her legs as she drags her sub back towards the bed, whilst she scratches and screams at her. Agatha’s clipped nails do no damage to her body suit, but then, in an astonishing attempt to break free, she throws herself <i>AT</i> Rio instead of away from her. Her mouth is opened wide, with teeth bared. And then she chomps down on Rio’s upper arm.</p><p>Rio knew she might come away from this scene with injuries, but holy fuck, she did not expect Agatha to bite her and then <i>clamp on.</i></p><p>She yells out in pain, trying to shake her off, but Agatha hangs on and growls, her eyes crazed. She looks like a rabid animal. “Give - up - get off - you feral piece of <i>shit</i> -” Rio chokes out.</p><p>She finally decides that <i>enough is enough</i> and grabs at Agatha’s throat, since she managed to get her to shut down by holding it before.</p><p>Agatha does indeed fall into a more submissive, obedient role the moment that Rio has a hand around her neck. Rio is able to guide her so that she collapses on her stomach on the mattress, chest heaving. She’s breathing so hard and fast that Rio worries at first that she might be hyperventilating. A quick check tells her that no, Agatha is fine - in fact, she seems more than fine. That glazed, confounded gleam has returned to her eyes, her breaths tremulous as she shakes all over. The adrenalin that hit her before is waning, and it’s leaving her a shivering, timid mess.</p><p>Rio’s adrenaline, on the other hand, is still pumping. She has Agatha on her belly, but she clambers onto the mattress next to her and puts a knee on the small of her back to keep her there, which causes her sub to release a weak, defeated whimper. It’s one of the most wonderful sounds that she’s ever been blessed to hear.</p><p>Rio tips her head back and closes her eyes in utter relief as she regains her breath, one hand placed on her chest, and the other on the back of Agatha’s neck, just to remind her sub that she’s not going anywhere.</p><p>She has never, in her entire life, felt so aroused. Rio has no clue that literally fighting somebody into submission would turn her on so much, but it has. Maybe it’s less of the actions, and more <i>who</i> she has managed to subdue, though.</p><p>Agatha is one hell of a woman, and yes, a very difficult sub, she’s starting to realize. The fact she’s managed to wrangle her into such a submissive position, face down and starfished on the bed, is a huge triumph. She looks ripe for the taking. And now Rio can reap her rewards.</p><p>Her upper arm aches, and she checks the bite, concerned she might need to safeword just to treat the wound. Fortunately, Agatha has not fully broken skin, but she’s left some nasty indents that have come super close. There are tiny pinpricks of blood she can see just below the epidermis, from where her teeth have broken capillaries. The bruising is already beginning to blossom.</p><p>“Jesus Christ. Did you have to bite that hard? Goddamn, I think I’m gonna need a tetanus shot, shit,” Rio rasps. “If I get tetanus from you, Agatha Harkness, <i>you</i> are the one who’s gonna suffer. One, you’ll be paying my hospital bill, and two, you won’t be getting head anytime soon because I’ll have fucking lockjaw.”</p><p>“Sorry not sorry,” she thinks she hears Agatha mumble, her voice muffled from where her face is smothered by the bedspread.</p><p>Rio wipes the sweat beading on her forehead off with the back of her hand, feeling hot all over. At this point, she’s not sure whether it’s from exertion or her libido. “Next time, I’m muzzling you the minute I walk through the door.”</p><p>Agatha shudders beneath her and melts into the bed. “<i>Yessss</i>,” she moans.</p><p>“Yeah, you like that idea?” the dominatrix laughs. Of course she does. “You want me to put you on a choke chain with a muzzle and a straight jacket like a psychotic animal who needs to be contained?” she teases.</p><p>A soft, meek little mewl is subsequently accompanied by a keening, “<i>Please</i>.”</p><p>“Oh, not one of your words,” Rio tuts. “But you can add that to your vocabulary, I like hearing you beg.”</p><p>She trails the hand wrapped around Agatha’s neck down her spine. She teasingly nudges her client’s crop top upwards, to strum her fingers up and down the laces of her corset bra. Agatha’s breathing grows rugged and wispy, and she twitches beneath her touch; her legs widen, as if she’s hoping Rio will slip between them.</p><p>“Now, you are gonna keep your face down, and allow me to tie you to the bedframe without moving an inch. Aren’t you, Agatha?” she asks in a purr.</p><p>She punctuates her last sentence by slipping her hand further down… down… down… until she grazes her fingertips lightly between the junction of Agatha’s thighs. Gasping, Agatha tries to spread her legs further apart and thrust down, until Rio’s fingers press into her leggings directly above her clit. Rio grins. She’s soaked with her own slick. She definitely won’t be needing any of the lube she packed.</p><p>Wanting a quick taste, Rio pulls her hand away to drag her fingertips over her tongue. She’s met with a mildly salty, tangy taste that she instantly wants more of. Agatha whimpers and wiggles as if she’s uncomfortable, but she’s really just craving more pressure on her pussy. To prevent her from fidgeting her way to freedom, Rio presses more of her weight down on her lower back, smiling to herself. Agatha looks gorgeous, all flushed and desperate.</p><p>“Answer my question, Agatha,” she prompts her in a sing-song voice.</p><p>“Yes,” her client mutters, audibly resigned. “Yes, I’ll be good.”</p><p>Removing her knee, relieved to hear that Agatha is planning on behaving, Rio takes a moment to check in on herself. She’s a little tired, and physically sore from needing to tackle and wrestle Agatha onto the bed, but she’s in good spirits otherwise.</p><p>She’s confident in all of her decisions as Agatha’s dom so far, and thinks the scene is going well, despite Agatha’s… occasional interruptions and disobedience. Rio predicted that Agatha would put up a good fight, though, to make her earn her submission. She thinks that thus far, she’s stepped up to the plate.</p><p>Importantly, Rio is certain that Agatha is enjoying herself, which means that she is enjoying herself as well. “Green?” she checks gently, leaning to the side to brush Agatha’s sweaty hair away from her face.</p><p>To her surprise, Agatha starts to giggle. She turns her head to the side, those beautiful blue eyes of hers gleaming with euphoria. “Obviously,” she drawls.</p><p>Rio pokes her in the cheek lightly. “Ah ah,” she reprimands.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes but responds, in a snarky tone, “Smaragdine.” Sighing, the dominatrix quirks an eyebrow and gives her a stronger poke, on an area that she struck earlier so knows must be tender. “Green. I mean green,” Agatha dutifully and quickly corrects herself, wincing.</p><p>“<i>Good girl</i>,” Rio tells her firmly.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flutter shut and her whole body quivers as she turns her face back into the sheets, moaning. For a second, Rio wonders if she’s just come, completely untouched, from being praised. But she has a feeling that Agatha will be much, <i>much</i> louder when orgasming than that, so suspects that she’s reacting to a wave of pleasure brought on by being called good.</p><p>Straightening up, Rio slips off the bed and glances over to her backpack, where she flung it on the floor earlier. The coils of newly bought black braided silk rope, that she ordered specially for Agatha, are calling to her.</p><p>The legs of the bed look sturdy enough for Rio to secure each of Agatha’s wrists and ankles to, so she’ll be lying spread-eagle on her belly with her legs splayed wide without the need of a spreader bar.</p><p>Rio rubs her hands together and then cracks her knuckles, elated. It’s been a while since she’s used proper ropes in her work; her last couple of clients with bondage kinks preferred handcuffs, or ribbons.</p><p>There’s also a purple leather collar she purchased for Agatha, tucked into a box in the back of her work cupboard, that she’s planning to introduce during their next session. It came with a set of thin stainless steel chains attached to nipple clamps - and a longer chain that will link to one of Rio’s favorite tools for domination: her beloved clit vibrator clip. Judging by how Agatha requested collar and leashing when signing the contract, and how she has reacted so far to being treated like a disruptive wild animal, Rio is more excited than ever to play the role of beast tamer.</p><p>But that’s in regard to future sessions. Rio needs to focus on their current one. She has no doubt that Agatha will continue to fight and squirm and backtalk. Rio suspects that as soon as she’s restrained, her snark and sass are going to ramp up to another level.</p><p>She may have succeeded in getting the lawyer to submit now, which is an intoxicating feeling, but this was all just foreplay. Agatha is still going to act defiant and mouth off, in an effort to provoke and annoy her, as the scene progresses.</p><p>Part of her is enraptured by Agatha’s defiance. Agatha is a beautiful woman, with a serrated, brash personality. She’s quick-witted and sharp as a razor, a whirlwind of a human being. She’s the type of woman that idiotic men would label as loud, or too big for her boots. But Rio is really starting to think that her dauntlessness makes her even more irresistible.</p><p>She wants to spend hours worshipping her body and ravishing her from head to toe, which is not exactly a very professional thing to think. Rio <i>can</i> have fun having sex with Agatha, but she has to remember that she is working.</p><p>This is her job, that Agatha is paying her for. This is not a relationship, and she is not allowed to develop feelings or fall in love with a woman who is essentially her employer. She has to remain vigilant, and concentrate on giving her client the most memorable and gratifying experience possible.</p><p>“It’s in your best interest to stay still for this next part, Agatha,” she murmurs, gathering the silk ropes from her backpack in her arms. “Otherwise there’s going to be a lot of rope friction burn in your future.”</p><p>“Bring it on,” Agatha breathes. “There’s a B in BDSM for a reason.”</p><p>There is, indeed. There’s an S as well, which does not just stand for submission. It stands for sadism as well, which applies to Rio.</p><p>And she is going to thoroughly enjoy doling out Agatha’s fast-approaching punishment.</p>

<p>Agatha, being Agatha, does not stay still as Rio requests. Likely because Rio has asked her to. Her fault - she should know by now that Agatha will immediately and automatically disobey any and all orders that her dom tries to give her, if they aren’t to her liking. When the dominatrix turns back to the bed to begin laying out the silk ropes, in preparation for tying Agatha into position, the lawyer is already attempting to silently slink off the bed and escape.</p><p>“<i>Agatha</i>,” Rio growls. She took her eyes off her for a <i>single</i> second.</p><p>“Oopsie,” Agatha says, with a shit-eating grin. “Did you say you wanted me to stay <i>on</i> the bed? I forgot. You’ll have to remind me.”</p><p>She grabs her sub by the hair, ignoring her indignant yelp, and yanks her back into her belly-down position on the mattress. The cheeky smile is wiped off the older woman’s face and turns into an insolent scowl when her dom reminds her strictly, “You agreed to be good.”</p><p>“I am being good,” Agatha replies sweetly, kicking her legs up in the air and folding her forearms beneath her head. She looks comfortable and relaxed… but almost too comfortable and relaxed. “I haven’t bitten you again, have I?”</p><p>“Thank god for small mercies,” Rio mutters under her breath, rubbing at her arm where the teeth indents are located.</p><p>Agatha does not, to her shock, try and make a break for freedom again, splayed out on her stomach and obediently allowing Rio to arrange her arms and legs on the bed and begin to tie them. Every so often, she has to give Agatha a firm swat on the back of her legs or shoulder to order her to stop wriggling. Pinning her client’s hips to the bed actually makes her squirm even more, so that’s a no-go. She sort of reminds Rio of one of those hyperactive spaniels that can never sit still, constantly raising her head to check on what she’s doing with curious glances.</p><p>At one point, she takes hold of Agatha’s ankles to pull her further down the bed, which triggers her to try and kick Rio; she jabs her thumb into her calf in retaliation, where she knows the most common pressure points are located, digging her digit into the muscle. It triggers Agatha to emit a pained whine and then an aggrieved huff of defeat, going limp with an adorable pout.</p><p>Agatha’s mattress is much longer than a normal queen-sized one, with an extra few inches; with the lawyer’s feet hanging off the end so they can be tied to the bedposts, it creates a significant amount of space above where her head lays, which instantly gives Rio fresh ideas. She triple-checks the bindings on Agatha’s ankles, making sure they’re not restricting blood flow, before moving up the bed.</p><p>“<i>Stop</i>,” she has to demand, when Agatha keeps moving her arms before she gets the chance to wrap the ropes around her hands.</p><p>“Make me,” Agatha replies simply, with a feral gleam in her eyes.</p><p>Rio ends up clambering onto the bed to place her knee on her wrist as she ties them. She has to use much longer lengths of rope this time, but it’s not too much of an issue. It’s as she’s securing the ropes to the bedposts at the top of the bed, attempting to pull the lines as tight as possible to fully immobilize her sub, that she hears Agatha begin to snicker. She’s turned her head to face Rio, one flushed cheek squished to the mattress and she observes her with shining amused eyes.</p><p>“The fuck are you laughing at?” she snaps, feeling self-conscious. Is Agatha laughing at <i>her?</i> Rio tenses, teetering on the edge of dropping out of domspace.</p><p>Her sub sniggers. “That’s the <i>worst</i> taut line hitch knot I have ever seen.”</p><p>Rio blinks at her. She looks between Agatha and the silk rope she’s nodding at. “What?” she says dumbly, bewildered.</p><p>“I could literally free myself from that just by yanking.” Agatha rolls her eyes.</p><p>Rio stares. She’s pretty certain that she’s good enough at tying knots that Agatha won’t be able to escape. And then she is abruptly proven wrong when the lawyer twists her wrist in a motion that surely, <i>surely</i> must nearly dislocate the joint, and somehow slips her hand from the rope binding. She’s frankly aghast, and Agatha looks stupendously smug, waving her now free hand.</p><p>“If you untie my legs, I’ll show you how to secure my arms properly,” the older woman offers in a good-natured tone. The mischievous, teasing smirk on her lips is so obnoxious that Rio wants to smack her face.</p><p>Untie her legs? She’s just spent the last five minutes securing them. She grits her teeth, resisting the urge to blurt out that if Rio’s knots are so <i>shit</i> and easy to shimmy out of, then Agatha shouldn’t need her help to free her legs. “I’m not untying you.”</p><p>Agatha frowns at her, actually having the gall to look insulted. “Well, the scene’s not continuing until I’m certain you can tie a decent knot that’ll restrain me when I try to escape,” she scoffs.</p><p>Rio throws her arms up in the air, frustrated. Yeah, she’s thoroughly been knocked out of her dominant headspace now. “Just don’t try and escape then?” she suggests.</p><p>“Where’s the fun in that?” Agatha chuckles. “You know, there’s no shame in admitting when you’re… falling short.” She stretches her arm out to skate her fingers over Rio’s exposed thigh, which the dom halts by slapping her hand away.</p><p>Her jaw dropping, Rio splutters, “Excuse me?” Her chest aches with <i>deep</i> offense.</p><p>She realizes, in horror, that Agatha’s hurtful words have actually upset her. She’s never had a sub accuse her of not doing her job correctly in the middle of a scene. Is she falling short? She was sure ten minutes ago that she was stepping up to the plate and giving Agatha a satisfying experience, demonstrating to her how a dom should handle a difficult sub.</p><p>“You’re probably out of practice tying down a sub who actually makes you work to dominate them,” Agatha carries on blithely, ignorant to Rio’s sudden spiraling descent into insecurity. As she rambles, Rio tries desperately to pull herself back together, squashing down her emotions until she’s suppressed them enough to focus. “It’s not entirely your fault, of course, because silk is slippery. It’s low friction as a result, but it makes ropes much more difficult to tie into knots because -”</p><p>“Are you safewording?” Rio interrupts her bluntly.</p><p>Agatha shoots her a confused, exasperated look. “Did I <i>say</i> safeword?” she scoffs. “Elphaba couldn’t be as green as me.”</p><p>She did not safeword. Rio, however, honestly came close to for a moment. Imagine that? Her, the dominatrix, safewording during her very first session with a client. Agatha Harkness has not just started to chip away at her heightened emotionally protective walls of professionalism, she’s taken a fucking sledgehammer to them. A sledgehammer and several tons of thermite, wrapped up in purple lingerie that makes Rio’s mouth water.</p><p>Firmly back in control of her feelings - and by in control she means completely detached from them now she’s buried them down - Rio feels confident enough to take back control of <i>Agatha</i>.</p><p>She is really starting to wish she had brought along the collar she purchased for her, if only so she could attach a chain to it and give it a mighty yank whenever Agatha is mouthing off. But since she didn’t, Rio uses the next best thing; one of the silk ropes, that she has wrapped around Agatha’s neck as a makeshift leash in less than a second, forcing her to keep her head raised.</p><p>She runs her fingers through her hair with mocking gentleness, just until Agatha’s eyes begin to flutter in pleasure, and then she twists it in her grip to wrench it up. Agatha’s eyes half-roll into the back of her head with the sensation of the pressure on her throat from the silk rope and Rio’s hand tangled in her hair. She lies pliant, no longer fighting the bondage, and subtly thrusting her hips down into the mattress.</p><p>When she tries to slip her free hand beneath her body to stroke her own clit, the dom sharply exclaims, “<i>Ah ah!</i>” and uses her knee to pin it to the mattress. Leaning in close, Rio swills saliva around her mouth until she has enough to spit directly onto Agatha’s face. It lands with a wet splatter on her forehead and then dribbles down between her eyebrows, down her nose, and then into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha shudders in pure ecstasy, licking her lips. “Oh God,” she whispers.</p><p>“Oh no no no, he’s not here, honey,” Rio purrs, tightening her improvised silk leash. It’s borderline breath play, but doesn’t actually restrict Agatha’s breathing, just applies pressure that seems to make her go utterly boneless. “You prostrate yourself to <i>me</i>. I am the one who holds your fate in my hands tonight.” Her lips brush Agatha’s ear. Her tongue darts out to trace her client’s earlobe, which triggers the release of a keening whimper. “Be a good girl and don’t fight the ropes, and I’ll make it worth your while. And when I say be good, I mean keep your <i>fucking mouth shut</i> and do not insult my methods again.”</p><p>“Just offering… constructive… criticism,” Agatha wheezes.</p><p>“I didn’t ask for any. I know what I’m doing and I’m not going to take criticism from a filthy, needy, smart-mouthed slut like you. Do you want me to gag you?” She traces her fingers along the seam of Agatha’s lips, and she nods eagerly. “God, of course you do,” Rio mutters, smirking.</p><p>“Are you gonna put a vibrator clip on my clit now as you promised?” Agatha whispers breathlessly.</p><p>She actually sounds elated at the idea of being overstimulated as a punishment. Rio rocks her head back with a silent groan of realization. “Oh my god, is <i>that</i> why you won’t stop talking?”</p><p>“I’m very invested in the idea of clitoral overstimulation.”</p><p>Agatha is a sadist to the ninth degree. She is purposefully disobeying Rio’s order to only use the words she’s permitted to, <i>hoping</i> that Rio will punish her with the vibrator clip. The dominatrix shot herself in the foot; by unintentionally threatening something that Agatha would enjoy as a punishment, she has encouraged her to be as mutinous as possible.</p><p>Well then. The best way to punish her for… enjoying the idea of that punishment, is to just… not punish her that way.</p><p>She threads her fingers through the older woman’s hair. “Well, thank you for telling me that punishment wouldn’t be effective. And just like that, your clit’s going untouched for the rest of tonight and the vibrator clip has canceled its appearance. Congratulations, you played yourself.”</p><p>Agatha puffs angrily, like an irritated cat. “Killjoy.” She tosses and turns on the bed as much as she can, with her feet tied. “Are you at least going to <i>try</i> and tie some more artful knots? Or at least something the Girl Scouts wouldn’t mock you on Twitter for?”</p><p>Rio pulls her hand away from Agatha’s scalp and drops her silk leash, reveling in the displeased rumble she lets out. Seizing the older woman’s currently free hand, she begins to re-tie her client’s hand to the bedpost, winding the rope tighter around her wrist before knotting it, so there is absolutely no chance she can slip out of it this time.</p><p>“Let me tell you something, Agatha, I don’t give a fuck about how artful my knots are so long as they keep bratty little subs like <i>you</i> under my thumb.”</p><p>Giving the rope a solid tug before she secures it, she’s pleased to see that Agatha is now fully tied down and disabled from moving. In fact, Rio has pulled the ropes so taut that there’s not an inch of slack, meaning that Agatha is trapped in a rigid starfish position, her chin resting on the mattress.</p><p>Satisfied, Rio runs her hands over her body, skimming her fingers beneath Agatha’s crop top teasingly as she checks for blood restriction. The only thing that could potentially be worrying is how Agatha’s arms are being stretched, which may cause her shoulders to ache terribly tomorrow. The muscle ache will be a good souvenir from their session.</p><p>Agatha attempts to jerk, but the ropes hold tight. Every time she tries to wriggle, it causes the knots to cinch further, becoming more secure. Eventually, she stops fighting, and Rio smiles victoriously when she sees a surprised, impressed expression flash over her sub’s face, before it morphs into a pouty frown.</p><p>“Tight enough, now?” she jeers.</p><p>Agatha flexes her hands, turning her head to each side as she tests the restraints. “Yes,” she sulks, before lapsing into silence. She’s likely annoyed that she can’t put up a physical fight anymore.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean that Agatha has submitted. She’s wickedly intelligent and able to come up with biting remarks on the fly. All tying her down is going to do is make her ramp up her attempts to get into Rio’s head. For now, though, she appears to be quiet and reeling, coming to grips with the fact that Rio has, at this moment, subjugated her.</p><p>After all her raucous defiance and a vicious scrap earlier, the difficult sub has been restrained in an uncomfortable and vulnerable position; the only way that she’ll get out of it is by her dom’s concession, or safewording. Which Rio suspects that Agatha will categorically refuse to do, hence why she is paying such close attention to her body language and submissive mannerisms.</p><p>Rio begins her long-planned, choreographed method of driving Agatha to the brink of begging. She’s remarkably responsive to touch, even through her clothes, and so Rio behind to trail her hands over her shoulders and exposed arms, gently scraping her nails along her client’s skin. Immediately, goosebumps begin to appear, and Agatha’s limbs twitch. Her breathing shallows, becoming tremulous and uneven.</p><p>“Not so mouthy now you’re entirely at my mercy, hmm?” she murmurs. She’s beginning to feel the warm fuzzies again from the dominant headspace she’s dropped into, especially now that Agatha is quiet except for the occasional needy gasp and whimper.</p><p>When her hands reach Agatha’s ass, she runs her fingertips beneath the waistband of her leggings as if she’s about to pull them down. Agatha rocks her hips from side to side restlessly, and then hisses in displeasure when the dom’s fingers retreat. Rio palms her two asscheeks, instead, dipping her fingers between Agatha’s thighs lightly.</p><p>She’s met with fabric that is sticky with arousal, and she laughs in delight. As difficult a sub as Agatha is, she is without a doubt turned on by Rio taking her in hand to force her submission. She hasn’t even properly touched her client’s cunt yet.</p><p>“God, you’ve drenched your leggings. Horny thing,” Rio teases her. “Somebody is very turned on by being flung around and trussed up.”</p><p>She brushes her fingertips higher on the back of Agatha’s upper thighs, mere inches away from where her cloth-covered seam is located. Agatha’s legs quiver greedily, but are unable to close due to how her ankles are tied. Agatha begins to growl under her breath and shift agitatedly when she realizes that the only way she will get Rio’s fingers where she wants them is if Rio chooses to put them there.</p><p>She could carry on doing this for hours, torturing Agatha by denying her contact. But Rio has other plans. Crawls onto the bed, Rio situates herself so she’s kneeling in between her client’s spread legs. Agatha stills, and she hears her breath hitch, as she feels the mattress dip under Rio’s weight.</p><p>“Color?” she checks, one hand braced on the lawyer’s lower back.</p><p>Chuckling, Agatha glances over her shoulder at Rio, wiggling her eyebrows. “<i>Give me the green light, ‘cause I’m ready to go</i>,” her sub sings.</p><p>It takes all of Rio’s professionalism not to burst out laughing. Pitbull. Seriously? She can’t even bring herself to punish Agatha for speaking out of turn because she can quite honestly say that none of her subs have had the creativity to do <i>that</i> before.</p><p>Instead, having been once again given the go-ahead, she shuffles forward on her knees, until she’s pressing her left one directly up against Agatha’s covered center. Agatha’s head falls onto the sheets and she buries her face into them with a muffled moan.</p><p>It’s not Rio’s highly skilled and dexterous fingers as she would have preferred, but it’s pressure, exactly where she needs it. The dominatrix watches on eagerly as Agatha begins to rock her hips back and forth to try and get some friction, her ass clenched with effort.</p><p>“Here you go, baby, have a little grind against your dom’s thigh,” Rio spurs her on with a scornful laugh.</p><p>She grazes her hands over Agatha’s asscheeks and squeezes them - spreading them, so the older woman has more surface area to rub her cunt up against Rio’s leg. Agatha doesn’t seem to care about the pet names Rio uses for her anymore, she’s so frantically struggling to get some stimulation. It’s entirely the wrong angle for her to get any contact with her clit, but she still attempts to arch her spine as Rio shimmies her knee further between her legs. The gruff, discordant sounds she’s making, little whimpers and huffs and breathy noises, are like music to her ears.</p><p>“Good <i>girrrl</i>,” she purrs, rolling the ‘R’ around her tongue. “You hump my leg like a desperate puppy in heat, that’s it.”</p><p>She catches a glimpse of Agatha’s face, as she turns it to the side to avoid accidentally suffocating herself. She’s bright red, with flushed cheeks and glassy eyes. The praise Rio offered her has been tempered by calling her a puppy. She’s aroused, but also embarrassed. The lawyer grits her teeth furiously; just like an enraged dog, a snarl rips from her mouth as she tries to kick out and tear free from the silk ropes, her hands fisting in the sheets as if she wants to shred them.</p><p>“Whoa, there,” Rio whistles as if she’s a rowdy animal.</p><p>She pulls her knee back, removing her thigh, and Agatha cries out in outraged protest, yanking at the ropes wrapped around her wrists as she uses her core strength to lift her hips off the mattress. Rio clucks her tongue, shoving the back down with well-placed hands on her client’s waist.</p><p>“Uh, uh, calm down. Down, girl. We just got you all nice and restrained, we don’t want you getting all wild and jumpy again, do we?” she says warningly.</p><p>She phrases the question deliberately, so that the answer will be a negative. It’s a test, a trap, to see if Agatha is really paying attention to what she says. So often, Rio will have subs just start absentmindedly responding yes to every question because they fall into subspace and think that’s what she wants. In this case, she suspects that Agatha will automatically reply yes because she is distracted by her frustration.</p><p>Agatha falls right into Rio’s snare, muttering, “Yes,” dazedly. Before the dom can tut scoldingly, however, the lawyer jolts back to full awareness, hurriedly correcting herself, “No. I meant no.” But then she purses her lips, narrows her eyes at Rio and adds, “Depends, I suppose.”</p><p>“Oh, it depends?” Rio quirks an eyebrow.</p><p>“Do you not enjoy breaking in your subs?” Agatha rasps. “Whipping them into shape? Training them to serve you?” She peers back over her shoulder to give Rio a smile that is all teeth. “You were shaking like a leaf when you fought me earlier. Not from fear, but from the excitement. You <i>like</i> it that I challenge you, that I’m not easily brought to heel.”</p><p>Rio gives her a sharp slap on her ass, that she knows will leave a sting, even through fabric. “I also like it when you behave and don’t yank on your leash,” she tuts.</p><p>Her fingers wander downward. She presses her fore and middle fingers together and slips them between Agatha’s legs to apply pressure against her pussy. The soaked fabric of her leggings is so tight, and her thong barely a barrier, that if Rio presses hard enough, she can feel her fingers split her client’s lips apart. She’s hot, and wet, and if Agatha wasn’t wearing clothes, she thinks her fingers would slip into her sub’s slippery cunt without any strain.</p><p>Agatha trills needily, rocking her hips down against her dom’s hand, attempting to nudge Rio’s fingers against her clit. She holds her breath and falls motionless when Rio hums in admonishment, drawing her fingers up and away from where Agatha wants them most.</p><p>“Now, let’s talk about your homework. Did my horny girl manage to keep her hands to herself this week? Or did you have a little play against my orders?” She gets no verbal response and so taps her two fingers, making Agatha spasm beneath her hand with a mewl. “Well?”</p><p>“Yes,” the older woman admits. With her dominant hand, which is restrained near the top of the bed, she shakily shows three fingers.</p><p>“Three times?” Rio gasps with faux shock. She is not actually surprised though. She anticipated that Agatha would disobey and masturbate as soon as she spoke up against Rio during their consultancy session. “What did you use?”</p><p>“Wand vibrator,” Agatha answers, her voice strained and wheezy. “A-and a strap. Bought it after you left on Monday night, next-day express shipping. It’s black, called the Grim Reaper. Thought it was ironic because of your - your stage name. Made me think of you.”</p><p>Lady Little Death has to admit… she’s flattered. She makes a mental note to Google it later - she’s mostly curious about the strap’s length and girth. She’s inclined to think that Agatha is a size queen.</p><p>It definitely crosses professional boundaries, but Rio cannot resist the urge to question, “Did you fantasize about me while you masturbated?”</p><p>Her client huffs. “Why, does it appeal to your humungous dom ego?”</p><p>“That’s not a no,” she smirks. She does have a bit of an ego when she’s in dom headspace, it’s true. But it’s only because she is so utterly confident in her work ethic and her ability to bring even the most headstrong and boisterous subs to their knees. “Tell me, Agatha. What was I doing to you, in your fantasy? What were you thinking about? What naughty thoughts filled your head, making you so wet that you couldn’t stop yourself?”</p><p>Throwing her head back with a moan when Rio very gently pushes her fingertips into her entrance, stretching the fabric of her soaked leggings, Agatha chokes out, “Thought about riding you, you fucking up into me with the strap. You made me call you ‘my lady’. A-and you used a knife, a blade shaped like a scythe head. Carving your name into my thighs, getting your f-fingers all bloody, and using it to rub my clit to make me squirt. Then after you - you made me lick the strap clean, before servicing you on my knees as you held the knife to my th-throat.”</p><p>Holy shit, that’s so unbelievably unhinged.</p><p>And <i>hot</i>.</p><p>They barely know each other. They are essentially strangers. They have met in person <i>once</i> before this. And yet Agatha is already having extremely vivid, detailed, and <i>crazy</i> fantasies about her. It should disturb her. It should trigger her to safeword, and distance herself, because it is not normal for her sub to be masturbating to violent fantasies like <i>that</i> about Rio, before they even had their first session.</p><p>Instead, Rio is so insanely turned on that she’s on the verge of coming completely untouched.</p><p>“You filthy fucked-up whore. You broke the rules on purpose, didn’t you, Agatha?” she whispers. “I was testing your discipline, which you have <i>none</i> of, but you apparently decided you wanted to test me too. And see if I would follow through on my threat of punishing you if you touched yourself, when I explicitly ordered you not to.”</p><p>Agatha exhales with a short laugh, and beneath Rio’s fingers, her cunt pulses. Her legs quiver, desperately struggling against the ropes. “Yes.”</p><p>“You <i>want</i> to be punished?”</p><p>“<i>Yes</i>,” she cries.</p><p>“Hmm, three transgressions. You know, I’m a big believer in psychological punishment, over physical. Strange, I know, considering that I’m a dominatrix and spend ninety percent of my work spanking or paddling people,” Rio muses aloud, with a grin on her face. She spreads her two fingers apart, dragging them up and down, either side of Agatha’s pussy. And then she pinches. Agatha jerks and yelps, but still grinds down. “You… you’re a pain slut. You <i>enjoy</i> being slapped around and hit until you break. But you also seem to really like watching me work.”</p><p>Part of the reason why the older woman threw a tantrum earlier and scrapped with Rio was that she wanted to lie on her back, rather than her front, so she could see her. She contemplates for a moment. Yes, Rio could go ahead with the scene plan as they discussed, but Agatha also gave consent to Rio improvising and making small changes if she thinks they are necessary.</p><p>Right now, Agatha wants nothing more than to be touched - and probably to touch Rio as well. Recalling the scene plan, she thinks back on what Agatha requested and suggested be included. Denying her something that she’s been longingly awaiting for would be an excellent method of punishment.</p><p>“Here’s what we’re gonna do,” Rio announces. “You’re no longer allowed to touch me tonight. I will spend ten minutes masturbating directly in front of your face, with you not being able to make a single noise or move a muscle, for each of the orgasms you stole.”</p><p>Agatha lifts her head and shouts, “<i>WHAT?</i>” sounding utterly appalled. She splutters, now wiggling back and forth as she tries to turn over to face her. “No, that’s not fair! We agreed in the scene plan that I would get to eat you out!”</p><p>“Oh, I think it’s very fair,” Rio cackles.</p><p>“You’re a monster,” Agatha says in abject horror.</p><p>Rio traces her fingers over the seam of her client’s leggings that runs along the length of her pussy. “For not letting you stick that greedy tongue of yours in my cunt?”</p><p>“Yes, precisely! Entirely unreasonable! A punishment completely out of proportion to the alleged ‘crime’.” Agatha’s lip juts out in disdain. “I’m a lawyer, I would <i>know</i>.”</p><p>“You confessed, Agatha,” Rio chuckles darkly. “You knowingly disobeyed, of your own free will. You’re the one who chose to poke the bear. Three times, in fact. You reap what you sow.”</p><p>And when Agatha shakes her head vehemently, a ferocious scowl on her face, she lurches forward, one hand bracing herself directly next to Agatha’s head, while the other grabs at her core. She cups her cunt from behind possessively, relishing the way it makes Agatha squeal in shock.</p><p>“From the second you signed that contract, you signed <i>this</i> over to me. It belongs to me now,” she whispers, pausing between sentences to nibble at her earlobe. The hairs on the back of Agatha’s neck rise as Rio’s warm breath ghosts over it. “And I told you to keep your grubby paws off. You defied me. So now, instead of eating me out like we planned, I get to punish you.”</p><p>Agatha groans, and then even more dramatically when Rio withdraws and slips off the bed. “Noooo.” She turns to face her dom, cheek squished up against the mattress, her startlingly blue eyes pleading, and her lip curled.</p><p>“Yeeeesss,” Rio replies, in the same dragging tone, finishing with a laugh, bopping her sub on her nose.</p><p>It only takes her a couple of seconds to undo the fastenings keeping the bottom half of her bodysuit attached. She flings the scrap of fabric - wet with her own arousal - into the corner of the room. Rio grabs her phone, from her bag, and sets a thirty-minute timer, which will vibrate to alarm. She shows the screen to Agatha, who snarls, before setting it down on the bedside table, within easy reach.</p><p>As soon as the timer is ticking down, Rio doesn’t hesitate to touch herself; she learned pretty fast when she first stepped into the dominatrix profession that she couldn’t afford to be shy about her own body and exhibitionism. She’s not somebody who believes in having a completely clean-shaven cunt, but she does keep herself neat and trimmed down there. She wouldn’t want any of her clients to think her ill-groomed.</p><p>Spreading her copious arousal around, massaging her clit to send tingles of heat through her lower abdomen, Rio cocks her head at Agatha, who is watching her abashedly. Her client’s eyes are wide, her pupils dilated to the point where they are nearly fully black. Her mouth slips open with a tremulous exhalation. Her tongue darts out to wet her dry lips, as if she’s imagining Rio’s taste on her tongue.</p><p>Her eyes roam over the bed, lingering on that space on the mattress beyond Agatha’s head that she inadvertently created when she tied Agatha’s feet down near the very bottom of the long bed. <i>Perfect</i>. Arranging Agatha’s pillows so she can sit up against the headboard comfortably, Rio slinks forward with feline grace, settling herself down. She fits snugly into the gap, Agatha’s restrained arms framing her.</p><p>The older woman drinks her in with half-lidded eyes, her hungry gaze fixed on Rio’s glistening core. Smirking, Rio braces her feet against Agatha’s shoulders and then spreads her legs wide, to give her a better view. Breathing hard, Agatha tries to surge upwards, mouth open, but the bonds on her ankles and Rio’s feet on her shoulders prevent her from closing that two-foot-long gap between the sub’s face and dom’s cunt.</p><p>Just to torment her some more, and emphasise how Agatha won’t be able to reach her, Rio begins to finger herself. Tracing the pads of her fingers over her clit lightly, she dips them into her slit. Not enough to penetrate, but enough to tease herself, and trigger flickers of desire to lick through her body. Agatha stares, with a starving, despairing expression; her azure eyes are piercing, and her breathing is now jagged with want.</p><p>Rio tosses her head back with an exaggerated moan. “Oh, <i>Agatha</i>,” she says, in a high-pitched melodramatic voice.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha begs.</p><p>“You like what you see?”</p><p>“Yes,” she pants. “You know I do.” She whimpers. “God, you <i>asshole</i>, this is torture.”</p><p>“Hmm, yes, whine like the pathetic dog you are, Agatha. Your thirsty little mouth isn’t getting anywhere near my pussy tonight, not anymore.” Rio shifts further down on the bed, continuing to play with herself, drawing tight circles over her clit. Now only about twelve inches away from Agatha’s ravenous mouth, her sub cranes her neck to try and get a taste, groaning. “Oh, look at that, you’re desperate, aren’t you, hun? Go on, try,” she taunts.</p><p>Desperate expression contorting into a snarl, Agatha buries her face in her bedspread, muttering under her breath about how Rio is a cruel bitch.</p><p>“Too far? Aw, poor slutty sub, so eager to get a taste of her dom’s cunt, but she blew the opportunity by being rebellious. Really ruined things for yourself, didn’t you, pup?”</p><p>She reaches out with her slick-covered fingers and grazes them over Agatha’s forehead. Snapping her head up at the sensation of wetness, Agatha looks even more aggravated as she realizes that if she hadn’t just turned her face into the sheets to sulk, she could have caught Rio’s fingers in her mouth.</p><p>Disappointed in herself, and furious at having been denied, Agatha stops trying to stretch out to get a lick of Rio’s pussy - and instead tries to reach her leg instead, to sink her teeth into Rio’s calf.</p><p>“Ah ah!” Rio warns her, sitting up to grab her sub’s sweaty hair and wrench her away. “No biting! Bad puppy.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t bite if you let me eat you out like you promised,” Agatha pouts.</p><p>God, she is really annoyed by that. Rio releases her client’s hair, and Agatha’s chin plops back down onto the mattress. She applies pressure to the older woman’s shoulders with her feet, to cause some strain in her arms, and Agatha hisses ferociously.</p><p>“Quiet. I don’t want to hear a sound from you, and if you so much as twitch from now on, I’ll start all over again,” Rio tells her sternly.</p><p>Agatha’s nose wrinkles in annoyance, and she sinks her teeth into her lower lip, hard enough to draw blood. Rio uses her spare hand, the one not covered in her own arousal, to swipe her thumb over that bottom lip to collect the beads of blood there.</p><p>She pops the digit into her mouth, closing her eyes with a contented hum as bitter metallic saltiness washes over her tongue. Blood has a strange but not wholly unpleasant flavor, and Rio has come to enjoy it over time. If it weren’t in the contract that it isn’t allowed, Rio would kiss Agatha to lick it out of her mouth.</p><p>With that thought wallowing in her mind, making her feel toasty warm all over, Rio strokes her clit a couple of times and then sinks a finger into her pussy. She tries her hardest to keep her eyes open, so she can watch her client’s expressions.</p><p>“I bet you wish these were your fingers, huh, Agatha? Fighting you, pinning you to the bed, god, it was so fucking hot.” She’s getting even more turned on just remembering Agatha’s feral clawing and scratching as Rio was forced to physically subdue her. She focuses entirely on her client, eyes flitting over her angular cheekbones, her sharp jaw, those <i>fucking sky blue eyes</i>. She wants to see them filled with tears. She’s not lying, or embellishing, when she tells her, “You’re <i>beautiful</i> and it makes me so wet.”</p><p>The heady, slightly earthy scent of sex begins to envelop her senses as it takes over the bedroom. Agatha continues to chew on her lower lip to try and stifle her sounds. Rio shudders at the lust she can see in her gaze, and slips yet another finger, and then another, between her folds. It’s almost uncomfortable because of how tight a fit it is, but the slight hint of pain makes her desire all the more potent.</p><p>“God, can you see how soaked I am?” she sighs wistfully. She alternates in motions, thrusting her fingers into herself and then withdrawing to lazily pet her clit, so the thrumming heat in her lower belly slowly begins to amplify and build. She could so easily get herself off in the next five minutes at this rate, especially with Agatha watching her, looking like she would devour her if given the chance. “My fingers are sliding straight in. I really carefully plan my diet, just so you’re aware, so I taste as sweet as possible. Maybe I’ll make you lick my cum from my fingers after we’re done here so you -”</p><p>“Yellow.”</p><p>Rio freezes. She hastily pulls her fingers out of her cunt, wiping them on the sheets as she straightens up. The dom in her is screaming at her to check on her sub, to investigate what could be wrong, if she’s okay. “Agatha?” she asks worriedly, lifting her chin and reaching to loosen the restraints. “Hey, what’s -”</p><p>“My back is <i>super</i> itchy,” Agatha says, frowning. She rolls her shoulder, shooting Rio a sweet smile. “Can you scratch it for me?”</p><p>Rio stares at her. In utter disbelief. Thrown.</p><p>“Your… your <i>back is itchy?</i>” she echoes, dumbly. “You safeworded because of an itchy back?”</p><p>“It’s driving me crazy!” Agatha whines. “And I’m tied up, it’s not like I can scratch it!”</p><p>This is… certainly a new one for Rio. She’s kind of in shock, not processing it properly. Part of it is down to how rapidly she was ripped out of dominant headspace, which always leaves her at risk of top-drop after a session. It’s… not exactly the most eloquent use of the traffic light system.</p><p>Considering Agatha’s prior distaste towards safewords, however, and that Rio was utterly convinced that Agatha would refuse to safeword for any reason, she supposes that it’s actually a good thing that her client felt safe enough to call yellow. Even if it is for an itchy back.</p><p>Rio returns to a kneeling position, pressing her legs together in such a way that it continues to mildly stimulate her clit as she leans over and slides her hand beneath Agatha’s crop top. She can’t believe she’s doing this. But if this is what her sub needs, then she’ll provide it, no matter how batshit it is. Agatha indicates that it’s near the middle of her back, just below her corset bra, that she’s feeling particularly itchy. She scratches until red welts begin to appear and Agatha sighs, pleased.</p><p>“Better?” she asks, falling back against the headboard.</p><p>“Oh yes, perfect. Thank you,” Agatha purrs. “You can get back to tormenting me now. Oh, I mean ‘punishing’ me. Although if you’d like some feedback, if you stretch your fingers out whilst they’re inside you and show me how wet you are, that’ll really make me feel like I’m missing out.”</p><p>This session might honestly be the most bizarre one she’s ever held. Agatha Harkness might be the <i>craziest</i> client she’s ever served.</p><p>Rio runs a hand down her face, floored. “Can you withhold your constructive criticism for the after-scene debrief, maybe?”</p><p>“Okay, fine, just trying to be helpful!” Agatha chirps with a wink. “Carry on, chop chop! I’m as jade as the yoni egg in my bedside drawer. It’s wonderful for my pelvic floor. You can borrow it if you like.”</p><p>She is not shoving Agatha’s jade egg up her vagina for her entertainment. Rio contemplates, briefly, smothering Agatha with a pillow. But then reckons that she would probably enjoy that, and the whole point of this exercise is to punish her. And so far, judging by Agatha’s exasperated sounds, her half-chewed-to-death lip, and the restlessness shaking her limbs, Rio thinks she’s doing a pretty good job of it.</p><p>It takes her a good minute or two to get back into the right mindset. Once her feet are planted on Agatha’s shoulders again, and her sub is nuzzling at her ankle and watching on whilst smacking her lips, Rio re-starts.</p><p>She’s much more sensitive than before after all of her drawn-out teasing, her clit burning beneath her touch. Her fingerprints feel like bare flames on her pussy as she eases them back inside herself. She takes Agatha’s suggestion in hand by spreading her fingers apart, to expose the vulnerable hot pink insides of her cunt to the older woman’s gaze.</p><p>The sound that tears from Agatha’s throat is so inhuman that it makes her sound wolfish, like an animal gnashing its teeth. She’s sweaty, her cheeks a delicious pink, and the veins in her forehead bulging out. The silk ropes tied around her wrists creak with tension as she strains against them.</p><p>“You’re dying to get a taste, aren’t you, Agatha?” Rio laughs. “I can see how flushed your face is, how thirsty you are. You’re licking your lips like you haven’t eaten in days. Do you need a good meal? You’re so close to trying to break those ropes to bury your face in my pussy and eat me up.” She wiggles her soaked fingers in front of her sub’s face mockingly. “You want this honey, don’t you?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips turn down. “Yellow.”</p><p>Rio’s hand falls limply to the mattress. She’s once again stumped. Maybe she went too far, with the degradation and insults. “I’m sorry, did I say something that -”</p><p>“My back is itching again.”</p><p>Her jaw drops open. <i>What.</i> And then… it dawns on her. “Oh my god. Oh my god, you <i>bitch.</i> You’re fucking with me. You’re torturing <i>me</i> by false safewording.”</p><p>“<i>Pardon?</i> Me? Noooo, I would never! How dare you accuse me of such <i>outrecuidance, madame</i>,” Agatha denies theatrically, with the fakest French accent Rio has ever heard. Her words are countered by her gloating smile and shining eyes.</p><p>Rio scrambles up onto her knees, and then off the bed. She swipes her phone from the bedside table and cancels the timer. Twelve minutes. That’s all Agatha managed before trying to throw a fucking emotional grenade.</p><p>The dominatrix paces back and forth like a caged tiger as she pinches the bridge of her nose in pure vexation. The wetness between her thighs cools, leaving her feeling delicate and deflated. She doesn’t cover herself up because she honestly doesn’t care about being half-naked; she’s burning not with arousal anymore, but with incandescent rage.</p><p>But Rio cannot and will not allow herself to take that anger out on her sub - no matter how much Agatha deserves it.</p><p>“Aww, is somebody upset they didn’t get to finish?” Agatha sneers.</p><p>“You’re such a sadist!” Rio snaps. She stills, and takes several deep breaths to calm herself. She schools her voice so it is calm and flat as she states, “Agatha, you can’t safeword if you don’t really mean it. Ever heard of the boy who cried wolf?”</p><p>Agatha shrugs her shoulders as well as she can with her arms tied down, with a ‘<i>meh</i>’ expression that once again causes Rio to begin spiraling into a pit of fury. And she’s not just angry. She’s <i>mortified</i>. Mortified and perturbed.</p><p>She’s had bratty, disobedient subs before, and subs who do not safeword when they should, <i>and</i> subs who safeword so often they can barely get through a scene. But she has never dominated a sub who blatantly <i>misuses</i> the safeword system, to play mind games.</p><p>“You’re upset,” Agatha observes.</p><p>“Furious, actually.”</p><p>“You’re overreacting,” her client mutters, rolling her eyes.</p><p>“No, I’m fucking <i>not</i>.” She clenches her fists and crosses her arms tightly over her chest, gritting out, “Safewording is a very serious thing that <i>must be respected!</i> The traffic light system exists to keep us both safe. On the roads and also in the bedroom.”</p><p>Agatha swirls her fingers in random patterns over the sheets, scrunching her nose up adorably. “I’ll be honest, I don’t care much for traffic lights anyway. I’m a lawyer, yeah, but I’m not a big… following the driving laws person. Yellow is green to me and red is yellow. I’ve run at least four red lights just this week without any repercussions whatsoever,” she brags with a cocky grin. “They can’t afford cameras around here so I don’t get caught. And if I ever get pulled over I usually just tell them I’m colorblind and if that doesn’t fly, I flash the cash. Cops are all corrupt as fuck so it always works.”</p><p>Good lord. How the hell has she not been involved in a car crash yet if she doesn’t stop at red lights!? It would honestly be pretty on-brand for Agatha to have a suspended driver’s license. Or not actually have one at all.</p><p>Rio shakes her head, disturbed. “Remind me to never get in a car with you.”</p><p>Agatha barks a laugh. “Please, you couldn’t afford me. I charge everybody I give lifts for gas plus an inconvenience fee. Strangely enough, I don’t get many people asking for lifts nowadays.”</p><p>Rio is not surprised to hear that. She understands asking someone to contribute towards paying for gas, but charging them a fucking inconvenience fee? The people in her life asking for lifts probably figured it was cheaper getting Ubers in the end. Cheaper and less likely to get them killed or arrested for accessory to vehicular manslaughter. Although since Agatha is a morally dubious criminal defence attorney she could likely get them off for a slap on the wrist.</p><p>Agatha tilts her head, asking, “What were we talking about?”</p><p>“The traffic light safeword system. Which you blatantly misused and don’t respect,” Rio says bluntly. When Agatha nods understandingly in a smug manner, Rio bows her head, conflicted. “I can’t do this if you’re not gonna adhere to the terms of our contract.”</p><p>Agatha wiggles in her restraints, resting her cheek on the mattress as she asserts, “Oh, but I <i>am</i> complying with the contract. The contract stipulates that I should safeword whenever I feel unsafe or uncomfortable. And an itchy back you can’t scratch because your dom has you tied to the bed is practically the definition of discomfort.”</p><p><i>Touché</i>, Rio reluctantly thinks. She supposes that discomfort is entirely dependent on the tolerance level of an individual. The majority of subs will call yellow if their restraints get too tight, or start to cut into their skin. Or if they’re feeling too overwhelmed and need a break. Agatha has a high pain threshold and is currently feeling understimulated, if anything, so maybe an itchy back is annoying enough for her to call yellow.</p><p>She’s irritated, and frankly stunned, by Agatha’s impertinence, but Rio doesn’t want the session to end. She doesn’t want to cancel the contract. She enjoys dominating Agatha and wants this relationship between them to continue.</p><p>Goddammit. She is getting way too emotionally invested than is professional, but she can’t <i>help it</i>. If Agatha were any other client, it would absolutely be a one-strike and you’re out policy. But Agatha is <i>Agatha</i>. Ruthless and snarky and spellbinding. And Rio wouldn’t take her any other way.</p><p>“I will give you a pass for that one, but you <i>cannot</i> do it again, am I clear?” she threatens. “You misuse the traffic light system again and this arrangement is over.”</p><p>“But I was uncomfortable,” Agatha complains. “And I don’t like being tied up.”</p><p>Rio collapses onto the side of the mattress, making Agatha bounce on top of it. The audacity of this woman, to whine about being restrained. “Newsflash, Agatha, you <i>asked for this scene to be uncomfortable</i> and you specifically requested I tie you down,” she reminds her harshly. “You went so far as to say that it was ‘necessary’ before we even signed the contract.” Regardless of this, Agatha continues hitting her with a petulant glare. Rio is nearing the end of her rope, if only because Agatha keeps attacking it with a chainsaw. “If you are truly unhappy with today’s scene, you can call red or safeword and we’ll stop.”</p><p>Agatha’s scowl transforms into an expression of confusion. “I don’t want to stop. I paid for this service, why would I want to stop it?”</p><p>“You hired a dominatrix for five thousand dollars a night. Then you decided that you would rather spend the scene trolling her than allowing yourself to enter submissive headspace, behaving and following orders, and earning your orgasms for the night,” Rio deadpans.</p><p>“I’ll orgasm regardless of whether or not I behave, so -” Agatha cuts herself off when the dom stands and takes a few heavy steps away from the bed. She’s disheartened to hear that her sub doesn’t care about <i>RIO</i>, her dom, gifting her release. “Hey. Hey, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to disrespect you or your work,” her client stammers, yanking at her bonds. She actually sounds unexpectedly contrite. “I - I can tell you put a lot of thought into developing and planning this scene for me.”</p><p>“Yes, I did,” Rio agrees brusquely.</p><p>And then in an astonishing turn of events, Agatha <i>apologizes</i>. “I’m sorry I’m not taking it as seriously as I should.” Silence falls between them, a gaping frigid abyss, and then Agatha asks, her voice achingly quiet and small, “Are you gonna leave?”</p><p>Rio completely stills. <i>Leave?</i> She glances back over at Agatha, who has turned her head almost 180 degrees in her desperation to keep Rio in her sightline. She looks, for the first time, truly panicked. There’s a sadness in her eyes that is hauntingly genuine. And most significantly, she looks <i>resigned.</i></p><p><i>Has this happened before?</i> Rio begins to wonder, her head spinning. Agatha is testing her, is batting her back and forth between her paws like she’s a mouse, rather than a much bigger cat. Rio is a strong enough dom, physically and mentally, to withstand her pushy, bratty behavior. She is willing to put the time and effort into bringing her to heel.</p><p>Have other doms labeled her a lost cause and departed, in the middle of a scene? Because they didn’t like that Agatha does not immediately obey and fall into subspace when they want her to?</p><p>Is that what Agatha’s ex-girlfriend did? Walked out on her? Called her a <i>bad sub</i>, and then left her alone and stranded?</p><p>Sighing, Rio returns to the bed, carefully sitting next to her sub. She quickly checks with a look if Agatha is okay with touch, and when she nods frantically, she strokes over the older woman’s hair, down her back. Offering comfort, not disdain. No condescension or rejection.</p><p>“No,” Rio murmurs. “No, I would never walk out on a sub who is having difficulty staying in headspace in their first scene with me.” She slinks off the bed so she can kneel beside it, so she and Agatha can be on the same level. She rests her chin on the edge of the mattress as Agatha turns her face to look at her with those big, doleful eyes. “I can tell you get there, but you just don’t remain down.”</p><p>Agatha appears to relax, now she’s been reassured that her dom is not abandoning her. “I liked it when you were throwing me around and calling me a slut,” she offers.</p><p>“I could tell,” Rio smirks. Agatha was pretty much manic earlier when they were fighting, and was getting fired up when Rio was leaning into her degradation kink. Come to think of it… she was the most engaged in the scene when she <i>wasn’t</i> tied down, and could swipe back at Rio with her hands and her barbed words. “You like to play a more active role in your scenes, don’t you? You like to give, rather than receive.”</p><p>It’s yet another thing to add to the list that Rio is compiling of reasons why Agatha might struggle to submit. Primarily, it’s a list of evidence of why she would actually make a good dom. She’s a self-described switch, that’s true, but everything Rio has seen from her so far is definitely implying that Agatha is not suited for submission, but would make for a great dominant.</p><p>The most pressing evidence so far is Agatha’s desire to always have a measure of control, and the fact that she likes to be hands-on; she threw a fit as soon as she found out she was no longer permitted to touch Rio and looked genuinely tormented when the dom was out of her reach during the masturbation punishment.</p><p>“Typically, yes,” Agatha agrees. She gives Rio a softer smile, one that is much shyer than her normal ones. “I liked the fact that you originally planned to make me eat you out and ride my face.” She raises an eyebrow accusingly. “Then you had to go ahead and change the plan.”</p><p>“To punish you.”</p><p>“I don’t like punishments.”</p><p>“You’re not <i>meant</i> to, Agatha, that’s what makes them effective,” Rio chuckles, tapping her nose.</p><p>Agatha’s face crumples, and for a fleeting second, the dom is concerned that she’s about to cry. But then, she lets out the cutest little sneeze she has ever heard. She grabs her a tissue from her backpack, knowing she won’t want to blow her nose on her sheets, and as she does so, she thinks deeply. She’s already changed the scene once tonight, and usually, she wouldn’t do it again. Too many changes all at once can overwhelm a sub. And Rio is not a dom who <i>ever</i> changes a punishment when she’s halfway through it.</p><p>These are extenuating circumstances, though.</p><p>When she returns to the bed, and helps Agatha blow her nose, she informs her gently, “We’re going to continue, but I’m going to retract my order for you to not move a muscle. I’m going to put a pillow between your thighs, and I want you to rut against it while you watch me.” Agatha’s eyes light up with delight and bewilderment. “You can’t come without permission, still, but I want you to observe my fingers and imagine that I’m doing it to you instead.”</p><p>“You’re… you’re <i>changing</i> my punishment. So it’s… better for me?” Agatha questions, dazed.</p><p>“So you play a more active role in the scene and get more out of it, yes,” Rio nods.</p><p>When Agatha continues to appear baffled by her decision, she shifts from side to side self-consciously. Likely Agatha is wondering why exactly she would change a punishment mid-way to make it easier on her - wondering why Rio is being merciful. She does not protest, however, or argue that Rio doesn’t need to be lenient… or take pity on her. She just… tilts her head curiously, narrowing her eyes and scrutinizing her as if she’s some kind of fascinating creature she’s never encountered before.</p><p>She explains, “My role as your dominant is to make sure you’re mentally engaged but also confident and relaxed enough to yield control, so you can sink into a submissive mindset. I’m changing the punishment because I think it will benefit you in your submission while also acting as a deterrent for future disobedience.” She grabs one of the pillows from the top of the bed, waving it around in the air with a quirked eyebrow. “So are you happy with that plan? Green?”</p><p>Agatha nods eagerly. “As Vermont.” Vermont. <i>The Green Mountain State.</i> Funny.</p><p>It takes some maneuvering, but Rio is eventually able to stuff the pillow between her sub’s legs, so that she can grind down on it and get some traction. Once that’s done, she double-checks all of the restraints once again to make sure they’re not hurting Agatha, and then vaults back onto the bed. She leans back against the headboard once again, legs fanned out and feet planted on Agatha’s shoulders.</p><p>As soon as she has Rio’s cunt in sight, Agatha’s eyes darken and she begins to subtly rock her hips down into the pillow. God, she’s so impatient. So greedy. Rio loves it.</p><p>The dominant stretches over to the bedside table, where her phone is lying, and selects a fifteen-minute timer. Agatha managed twelve minutes before she called yellow twice, and Rio isn’t brutal enough to make her start over from the very beginning, no matter what she told Agatha before.</p><p>She slips her other hand down between her thighs, fingers sliding over her clit.</p><p>Takes a deep breath, sinking back into headspace.</p><p>And presses <i>Start</i>.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio watches in fervent awe as frustrated tears very slowly begin to brim in Agatha’s eyes; the older woman frantically tilts her hips downward to hump at the pillow placed between her legs, panting in desperation as her wide, glazed-over eyes remain fixed on where Rio has been sliding her fingers into her pussy one by one for the past ten minutes.</p><p>Agatha has been behaving, surprisingly, since the timer re-started. In fact, it seems that the pretty intense conversation they had before, ending in Rio ultimately changing her punishment to better suit her needs, has worked wonders on her. She has fully succumbed to subspace, her mind happily floating on a cloud as her body thrums with desire - although clearly not as much as she would like, judging by her adorable little huffs and grunts.</p><p>Rio hasn’t even needed to grab one of the vibrators buried at the bottom of her bag, content with masturbating with just her hand. The dom in her is proud and satisfied. She loves seeing the look of pure longing on Agatha’s flushed face and the fraught tension in her furrowed brow.</p><p>Rio’s lower belly tightens, and heat is injected into her veins, upon hearing the whimpers torn from her client’s throat. Just having the ability to feast her eyes on her needy, enraptured sub is enough to get her so wet that her slick is dripping down onto the sheets, forming a dark patch beneath her ass.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, <i>fuck, fuck…</i>” she can hear Agatha very faintly muttering, through gritted teeth, in rhythm with her grinding down on her pillow.</p><p>“Oh, look at you. Look at those beautiful tears,” Rio breathes, her hips bucking beneath her own hand as she traces tight circles over her clit. Her thighs start to shake with the effort of holding back her orgasm, because she is getting close, <i>so close</i>. “God, you look stunning, Agatha. Is somebody getting frustrated they can’t come?”</p><p>“<i>YES</i>,” Agatha shouts, thrusting down onto the bed with such a huge amount of force that the bedframe actually creaks.</p><p>“Not enough friction, baby?”</p><p>She looks aggrieved. “You know there’s not.”</p><p>“Filthy, desperate girl. Should’ve put a towel underneath you. I bet you’ve made a big wet stain on your pillow. My adorable little puppy in heat.”</p><p>The timer goes off - three sharp bell chimes - before it silences itself.</p><p>Rio nearly doesn’t notice it. She's lost in curling her fingers inside herself to press them against her own G-spot while hungrily watching her sub’s rapidly building anguish at being forced to just <i>watch</i> as her dom brings herself to completion.</p><p>Agatha breaks. The tears spill, Agatha’s <i>beautifully fucking blue eyes</i> glistening with wanton wonder. “<i>Rio</i>,” she sobs, and that’s all Rio needs to hear before she comes, the pleasure slamming into her like an unexpected tidal wave.</p><p>She throws her head back with a strangled, “<i>AGATHA</i>,” and trembles with the force of her orgasm.</p><p>White-hot pleasure rips through her entire body, her cunt clenching around her fingers hungrily, and all Rio can think is how desperately she wants them to be <i>Agatha’s</i> fingers, Agatha’s strap, Agatha’s <i>everything</i>. In truth, she’s caught entirely off guard by just how hard she comes, gushing liquid that soaks her hand and makes the bedspread so damp it looks as if she’s actually wet herself.</p><p>She’s not sure how long the orgasm lasts - seconds or <i>minutes</i> - but she can hear Agatha’s ragged breathing and moans throughout it, a symphony that coaxes her through the depths and then slowly brings her back up to the surface afterward. She carefully withdraws her sticky fingers from within her core, wincing at the sudden empty feeling that gnaws at her.</p><p>Sighing in satisfaction, Rio flexes her hand to avoid cramps before slumping back against the headboard, boneless and tired and wrung out. And, honestly, <i>stunned</i>. She doesn’t think she’s ever come that hard with a client before. And certainly not during their first session.</p><p>It was not actually her plan to orgasm this early in the session… or orgasm at all today, truthfully. She’s not one to shame somebody for premature ejaculation, but she’s never done it herself.</p><p>Luckily, Agatha won’t <i>know</i> that she didn’t actually intend to make herself come, as she will probably think that it was part of her punishment - witnessing Rio come all over herself, without Agatha having ever touched her to contribute.</p><p>She’s somewhat troubled by the way she so clearly loses control of herself and her desires around Agatha, a woman that she barely knows and <i>will not, cannot</i> develop feelings for.</p><p>As soon as her heartbeat begins to calm, Rio <i>immediately</i> kicks back into dom mode. She focuses back on her sub, the whole reason she is even here in the first place.</p><p>Agatha is staring at her like she’s some utterly magnificent thing that she has never had the honor of looking at before, her eyes round and bright, and her mouth dropped open. She’s also trembling, just like Rio, and for a second, she briefly considers that Agatha might have come herself, just by watching Rio. But judging by the way she is still canting her hips into the pillow between her thighs, she hasn’t come.</p><p>Good, she thinks.</p><p>Slowly, Rio moves up onto her knees, and her pussy still squelches loudly with wetness despite how she spreads her thighs apart. She reaches out with her clean, dry hand and, after a quick glance at her client to ensure it’s okay, delicately strokes her fingers over Agatha’s forehead. The rumbling noise that Agatha involuntarily releases is one of pure contentment, like a big cat’s purr.</p><p>She cups Agatha’s face affectionately, swiping her thumb over her tear-stained red cheek to wipe the salty water away. The purr transforms into a quiet, embarrassed mewl, Agatha averting her eyes downward. She looks mortified to have started crying through her punishment, although Rio likes to think of it as a compliment, because it means it got under her skin… and therefore, got into her head.</p><p>Threading her hand through Agatha’s bedraggled mane of dark hair, Rio pets her with gentle shushing sounds, like she’s soothing an agitated animal.</p><p>“Good girl, Agatha,” Rio murmurs, the praise slipping from her lips easily. Agatha shivers beneath her hand, as the dom kneads her knuckles into the back of her sub’s neck before caressing down her spine. “You did it, you survived your punishment. <i>Such</i> a good girl for me.”</p><p>“Good?” Agatha echoes, sounding hazy. “Really?”</p><p>A swift glance at her eyes confirms to Rio that Agatha is fully down in subspace, and <i>staying down</i>. She looks spaced out, relaxed, <i>subdued</i>. She internally cheers, but also feels a stab of worry, because Agatha sounds astonished to have been called good. And with her praise kink, it’s something she definitely should have heard before… unless her doms were so terrible they never stumbled upon it, or they were like her horrible ex and called her <i>bad</i>.</p><p>It’s not difficult to praise a sub when they’ve obeyed an order, performed a pleasing action, or withstood a punishment without (or with minimal) complaints. “Hmm, so good,” Rio confirms, her trimmed nails lightly scratching at Agatha’s scalp. “Is my good girl still green?”</p><p>“So so so so green,” Agatha mumbles, the words slurring together. Her eyes darken as they flicker downward, to the junction of Rio’s slick-covered thighs. She pouts. “I wanted to make you come.”</p><p>“You did,” Rio reassures her, with gentle pets down her shoulders. “Your desperation was so gorgeous. All of your attention on me, those sweet little sounds… you tipped me over the edge. My pretty girl.”</p><p>“Could’ve made you come harder on my tongue,” the sub sulks. Agatha licks her dry lips, the tip of her tongue darting out like a snake’s as she moistens them and pleads in a small voice, “Please?”</p><p>“So polite,” Rio chuckles. It’s quite the change of pace from the snarkiness. It’s likely temporary, a subspace thing. She runs her hands up Agatha’s arms to subtly check the knots around her wrists. They’re holding firm, despite her earlier thrashing, and aren’t constricting blood flow. “Please, what, slut? Use your words. I give you permission, go on.”</p><p>Agatha chews on her bottom lip, which is still smeared with traces of blood from when she bit it earlier. She narrows her eyes slightly upon being called polite - probably because it implies docility, when she is anything but docile - but she exhales forcefully, and asks, “Please can I taste you?”</p><p>“Hmm, you get points for using your manners.” Especially when she seems reluctant to utilize them.</p><p>Rio debates for a moment whether or not she should slide down the bed and allow Agatha the honor of feasting from her directly, but then remembers that part of her punishment is not getting to eat her out as she desired. Dipping her fingertips between her legs, she swipes her pads through her folds, hips jerking as they graze over her sensitive clit. Gathering wetness on her fingers, she presses them to Agatha’s lips. She rubs her come over them so that the sub wears it like a lip salve.</p><p>“Here you go. Not quite fresh from the source but you haven’t earned that today. Open wide, whore.”</p><p>Agatha greedily sucks and swallows them down, lashing her tongue around Rio’s knuckles. She’s salivating, spit bubbling at the edges of her lips around Rio’s fingers as she surges forward to slip her fingers further down, past her client’s tongue.</p><p>“I want these to go <i>riiiiight</i> to the back of your throat,” she whispers. She’s amazed by Agatha’s lack of gag reflex as she practically ends up shoving her entire hand into her mouth. Her sub whimpers, but it’s not from discomfort - it’s from need. “God, you’re so cute when you’re not yapping my ear off and your mouth is full.” When Rio extracts her fingers, dragging slowly down against Agatha’s tongue to give her one last taste, she uses them to lift Agatha’s chin, not caring how it smears saliva all over her neck. “What do you say?” she prompts softly.</p><p>Agatha smacks her lips and comments absentmindedly, “Your vagina tastes like papaya.”</p><p>Rio startles. “Sorry?”</p><p>“Papaya. You know. The fruit.”</p><p>She knows what a fucking papaya is. She’s just never had a sub comment on her pussy tasting like one before. Probably because they are <i>sane</i>, unlike Agatha.</p><p>“S’meant to be a compliment,” Agatha mutters, her shoulders tensing.</p><p>No, no, no, she <i>just</i> managed to get Agatha to stay down in subspace, she is <i>not</i> letting her back up now. She wraps her hand around her neck, squeezing lightly to apply pressure that instantly sends her client stumbling back down into submissive headspace, her eyes rolling back. “Say thank you,” she demands.</p><p>Agatha frowns, muddled and disoriented. “But I’m the one who just complimented you.”</p><p>“Yes, on my <i>taste</i>, which you should be grateful for.”</p><p>“So I should say thank you to… your vagina?”</p><p>“<i>TO ME</i>,” Rio emphasizes, with a dominant growl in her voice that triggers her sub to shudder. “For letting you taste me.”</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha goes silent for about a minute, blinking slowly at her, before slurring out a mildly bewildered, “Thanks, but I would have preferred to eat you out.”</p><p>Rio bows her head to hide her amused smile. Yes, Agatha has made that abundantly clear. She climbs off the bed, keeping one hand steadily placed on her sub’s back to reassure her that she’s not going anywhere. She stretches out her leg to hook her foot around one of the straps of her backpack to pull it across the floor to just beside the bed; fishing out a handful of wet wipes, she cleans between her legs before her come starts to cool into an uncomfortable, sticky residue and then cleans her hands as well.</p><p>The next scene that’s described in their plan - excluding the section where she originally going to ride Agatha’s face and make her eat her out, which they scrapped in favor of a longer punishment section - is the part where Rio will untie Agatha from the bed, tie her arms behind her back and then make her sit on her lap, fully clothed, to grind against the dom’s stomach until she has permission to come.</p><p>Rio purses her lips.</p><p>She wants to change the scene plan again.</p><p>In fact, there’s nothing she wants more than to finger Agatha on her lap until she quite literally explodes.</p><p>It crosses a boundary. The scene plan states that Agatha will remain clothed for the session. She has no doubt that Agatha would be completely up for changing the plan so that she <i>does</i> end up undressed, but really, it’s a question of Rio’s professionalism and self-discipline.</p><p>She has never, in all her years of work, changed a scene so drastically just to fulfil her <i>own</i> desires. Her own wants and kinks should not factor into this - they do, but they take a backseat so that her client’s desires take the spotlight.</p><p>It would set a <i>very</i> dangerous precedent for all future sessions going forward for Rio to just… abandon the scene plan in lieu of improvisation. And yet… her instincts are screaming at her to alter the scenario, because she is convinced that it will <i>benefit</i> Agatha.</p><p>She is not a normal client. She is nowhere <i>near</i> the usual calibre of Rio’s subs. She needs a firm hand to keep her in line, and a dom who can rapidly adapt when she throws a spanner in the works.</p><p>Rio is partially beginning to suspect that Agatha’s difficulties with submission stem from her neurodivergency and also potentially some suppressed trauma, although it isn’t any of her business to speculate what. She prides herself on being an incredibly versatile and flexible dominatrix; if she has to revise scene plans on the spot to accommodate Agatha’s needs better, then she will do it.</p><p>Right now, she’s fairly certain that Agatha will not be able to mentally cope with being understimulated and forced to hump against Rio’s belly for friction. If she made her do that, she would just be asking for Agatha to crash out on her and throw a huge tantrum, and then there would be absolutely no hope of getting her down into subspace again.</p><p>She makes up her mind.</p><p>“Let’s get you untied from the bed, Agatha,” Rio says gently, reaching to loosen the knots tying the silk ropes to the bed posts.</p><p>Agatha visibly flinches as she feels the tension in her arms ease off. She raises her head to stare at Rio in outraged disbelief, thoroughly aware of her surroundings, almost as if being untied has wrenched her out of subspace. “What? No. Are we done already?” she asks, sounding disappointed and confused.</p><p>“Oh no, Agatha. Don’t worry, we’re not done yet,” the dom assures her.</p><p>In less than a second, she’s whipped Agatha’s crop top off and over her head, throwing it aside and leaving her top half in just her sheer purple corset bra. Before Agatha can start to flail around like a wild animal again, and begin to fight her, Rio yanks the sub’s arms behind her back instead, weaving the silk ropes still binding her wrists together to immobilize her.</p><p>With her legs still tied down, there’s very little Agatha can do to try and escape beyond rocking her shoulders from side to side, peering over her shoulder as she tries to watch what knots Rio is using to secure her wrists. Gripping a fistful of her client’s hair, she snarls loudly in her face; if Agatha is going to act like some feral creature then Rio will match her behavior and be the bigger, scarier animal.</p><p>Rebuked, but not beaten down, Agatha replies with a long-suffering sigh, “Good. I mean, I haven’t even come yet.” She squawks in pain when Rio gives one knot a mighty tug to pull it completely taut. She rocks back on her knees from where she’s kneeling on the edge of the bed, smug. Now there’s absolutely no way Agatha can twist her wrists free, not even if she dislocates them. “<i>JESUS</i>, Rio!”</p><p>“And it’s in my purview not to let you come, if you don’t behave,” Rio tells her firmly.</p><p>Carefully maneuvering Agatha’s legs once she unties them, she massages her client’s calves to decrease the risk of cramps developing, checking the red marks around her ankles. Yanking at the ropes caused the ropes to cinch slightly, but not dangerously so.</p><p>Agatha does, <i>once</i>, as Rio is rolling her onto her side, try to kick her. Feisty little thing. Rio bares her teeth and slaps the back of Agatha’s thigh sharply, and then again, until she yelps and draws her legs inward toward her chest.</p><p>“I’m behaving,” Agatha pouts at her.</p><p>Rio barks a laugh, skating her hand down from her sub’s shoulder to her breasts. Through Agatha’s bra, she seizes hold of her hard nipples and pinches. Lowering her head, she tongues at them through the thin purple lace, scraping over them with her teeth. The sub’s breasts almost spill out of the flimsy cups, which is perfect for when Rio licks upwards until she hits bare skin, and begins to suck a hickey into the meat of her left breast, above where her heart lies.</p><p>The only rule for today was no <i>visible</i> marks, after all.</p><p>Agatha writhes beneath her, whining when Rio stops to reprimand, “You’re being a brat.”</p><p>“We’ll have to agree to disagree on that one,” the sub replies breathlessly, thrusting her chest out and being rewarded for her debauched behavior when Rio shamelessly cups her breasts, rolling her nipples between her fingers. “Because <i>you</i> may think I’m being a brat, but I just think I have high standards and expectations that I refuse to lower.”</p><p>“No, Agatha. You <i>are</i> a brat. I’m your dom and you are meant to agree with and do everything I say while you are acting as my submissive,” Rio reminds her.</p><p>Agatha quirks an eyebrow. “So I’m meant to just - jump off a cliff if you order me to?”</p><p>Rio pauses in her action of winding her arm around her client’s waist to pull her upright into a sitting position on the bed. She rears her head back and makes eye contact, baffled. “Why the hell would I ask you to jump off a cliff?”</p><p>“I don’t know, maybe you’re into cliff jumping just like you’re into waterskiing,” Agatha shrugs breezily.</p><p>Waterskiing? “I’m not into waterskiing.”</p><p>Where the hell did Agatha get the idea that she’s into waterski - oh god, she’s referring to <i>watersports</i>. Rio feels her cheeks burn and hopes beyond hope that Agatha cannot see, from her position on her side, her dom’s face turn crimson.</p><p>(She actually is a little into watersports.)</p><p>Shaking her head, she asserts, “I am not going to tell you to jump off a cliff or do anything to risk your safety while we are in your bedroom <i>in the middle of a BDSM scene</i>.”</p><p>Agatha sniffs, wriggling her body until she’s sitting cross-legged, arms tied behind her in such a way that she will not be able to get free without external help. “Glad we could clear that up.”</p><p>Determined to take back control, Rio crawls back onto the mattress and turns over, returning to her position splayed out against the headboard, but sitting further upright this time. Her thighs end up pressed together, and she shifts back and forth as she squeezes them together, which causes her now super-sensitive clit to tingle.</p><p>She snaps her fingers in such a way that Agatha instantly perks up, on the alert, like a spaniel hearing the sound of a whistle. Maybe Rio will bring a clicker into the bedroom at some point; it will be both hilarious and extremely arousing if she finds out she can train Agatha on one.</p><p>She taps the top of her thighs, and Agatha appears to gulp, the flush spreading from her cheeks down her neck. Tossing her messy over her shoulders so it falls down her back like a brunette waterfall, Agatha gingerly climbs from her cross-legged sitting position onto her knees, wobbling a little because of how she cannot use her arms to balance. She then cautiously begins to walk on her knees across the mattress until she’s kneeling directly in front of Rio.</p><p>The dom raises an eyebrow. “You know where I want you,” she murmurs.</p><p>Agatha bobs her head in a nod, but her lips also tick upwards in a fleeting sneer, as if to silently communicate <i>you don’t have to patronize me, I know what to do</i>. A mischievous look briefly passes over her face as her gaze wanders downward, as if she’s wondering if she could fake losing her balance and planting her face in Rio’s crotch, and get away with it. But Rio clucks her tongue in admonishment, smoothing her hands over her thighs.</p><p>Blushing prettily, and almost looking a little shy, Agatha shuffles forward until she’s straddling Rio’s legs, her knees on either side of her hips, and then lowers herself to sit on her lap.</p><p>Rio sighs happily as her sub’s weight settles on top of her, and once she raises her hands to take hold of Agatha’s hips, she immediately feels more grounded in her dom headspace.</p><p>“Happy?” Agatha puffs.</p><p>“Oh, ecstatic.” She caresses Agatha’s back, fingers following along the ribs of her corset bra and plucking playfully at the clasps. “Are you done with the snarky comments?” she asks.</p><p>Agatha rocks back and forth on her lap, grinding down. Rio can feel how heated and soaked her cunt is through her thin leggings, her bare thighs damp from her slick leaking through the fabric. “I don’t know, am I?” she rasps cheekily.</p><p>Rio quickly dips her fingers between her legs. Despite having cleaned herself down there, she’s already gushing once again, and wetness has gathered within her bush.</p><p>She wiggles her wet fingers in front of Agatha’s mouth until she dutifully unhinges her jaw to suck them in, groaning as the taste of her dom washes over her palate. She opens her mouth even wider as Rio forces her fingers further down her throat until she fakes a gag that nearly makes Rio come on the spot it’s so hot.</p><p>“God, next time I am <i>definitely</i> gonna gag the fuck out of you,” Rio says, ragged. She’s got the perfect thing at home: a chewable ball gag that’ll both shut Agatha up and give her something to work her aggravation out on instead of trying to sink her teeth into Rio’s arms and legs.</p><p>Agatha pulls back so that Rio’s fingers emerge from her lips with a <i>pop</i>. “Oh, but you’d miss out on my magnificent commentary and constructive criticism,” she quips, her voice hoarse.</p><p>“I could do without both, to be honest, because you have a tendency to knock me out of headspace.”</p><p>Agatha, the troublesome and antagonistic sub that she is, brightens with a mirthful grin. “Wait, <i>really?</i> My sarcastic comments are disruptive enough to distract a seasoned, experienced dominatrix from focusing on her carefully constructed scene?”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. “That’s not a good thing,” she points out, “when I’m trying to help you get down into subspace.”</p><p>“Subspace is overrated,” Agatha shrugs.</p><p>She raises an eyebrow. “You didn’t seem to think so earlier.”</p><p>“Don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“So you didn’t feel all light and happy and fuzzy? Like you were floating on a cloud, or daydreaming?” She certainly looked spaced out and overtaken by euphoria earlier.</p><p>“Well yes, but that wasn’t subspace.”</p><p>Rio blinks. What. “Agatha, what do you think subspace <i>is?</i>”</p><p>“Losing control and becoming disconnected from your body and actions.” Agatha averts her gaze, grimacing. “Shutting down. Dissociating. I don’t like it. It reminds me of…” she trails off, looking lost and haunted. She then shakes her head firmly, muttering, “Never mind.”</p><p>Rio recognizes that cagey look in Agatha’s eyes. She’s seen it before in subs she’s worked with who have survived horrific abusive situations. Subs who have suffered mental trauma can struggle with subspace as it is essentially a form of dissociation, which many people with PTSD, depression, and anxiety experience during jarring episodes that make them feel deeply unsafe.</p><p>Subs who are neurodivergent tend to have a different experience when it comes to subspace as well, from what Rio has been told, but she will definitely need to do some more research about that. Rio will not make any assumptions about Agatha and her past - that’s private, and she is not entitled to any of it - but it’s clear that her ADHD may play a role in her struggles with achieving and remaining down in subspace.</p><p>“I think we’ll need to talk about your relationship with subspace at some point,” Rio muses aloud. “Because trust me, you were definitely in subspace earlier and definitely enjoying it.”</p><p>“Subspace <i>schmubspace</i>. Forget that. Are you going to get back to domming me any time soon?” Agatha complains, wriggling in Rio’s lap impatiently. “Because I wanna come and you’re being a big ol’ meanie making me wait when I’m behaving so well for you.”</p><p>The dom pinches her side. “If you pipe down, yeah.”</p><p>“At your command, my lady,” the old woman responds in a mock-posh voice, bowing her head.</p><p>Tutting, Rio grasps her sub’s waist and heaves her closer, until their bodies are inches apart. Stroking her hands up and down Agatha’s thighs and hips, she grasps hold of her asscheeks through her leggings and tenderly pulls them apart, which makes her client instinctively thrust down on her with an adorable needy sound.</p><p>“Now, Agatha, usually at this point I’d make my sub grind in my lap like a bitch in heat until I allow them to come. But I think, for communicating and apologizing to me when you were trying to rile me up, you deserve something a little better,” Rio whispers. “How about it? You up for a teeny little alteration to our plans?” Agatha will have the option to call yellow or red once she starts, of course, but she can’t bring herself to begin without at least checking first.</p><p>Agatha eyes her cautiously. “Better like…?”</p><p>Rio likes to show, not tell. She slips her dominant hand from the older woman’s ass to her front, and teases the waistband of her leggings, making her plan obvious. Agatha’s eyes widen until she looks like a deer in the headlights, and she holds her breath.</p><p>Taking that as permission, Rio twists her wrist and then slides her fingers beneath the waistband of Agatha’s leggings, beneath her thong. Agatha has a healthy amount of public hair that tickles her fingertips as they pass through, and then she glides two crooked fingers in between her folds.</p><p>Agatha is <i>drenched</i>. Forget the lube in Rio’s backpack; she is absolutely <i>never</i> going to need it. Rio uses her forefinger to stroke delicately between her client’s labia - tracing around her clit, but not over it - until she finds her hot, tight little entrance. One fingertip, two fingertips, three… Agatha’s greedy hole stretches for all of them, clenching furiously, as if trying to draw them in.</p><p>The fervid, impassioned moan that tears from Agatha’s throat is downright pornographic. She’s frozen, unmoving, but is almost shivering with desire; she clearly wants desperately to thrust down to spear Rio’s fingers inside her, but knows that doing so will end badly for her.</p><p>“<i>Better</i>, that’s <i>definitely better</i>,” her sub exhales, nodding enthusiastically. “I am one hundred percent on board for changing the plan if it involves your fingers.”</p><p>“I thought you would be. Oh, baby… s’like a fucking faucet down here,” Rio murmurs in admiration. “I could just shove my whole fist up your tight slippery little cunt if I wanted to.” That would definitely be a delightful sight: her entire hand disappearing between her sub’s puffed-up, swollen lips, up to her wrist.</p><p>Agatha wheezes. “Faucet’s not a very sexy comparison.”</p><p>Rio can’t help it; she laughs. She has her hand in Agatha’s pants and is feeding her fingers slowly into her sloppy pussy, literally on the verge of pushing them inside her, and even now… Agatha is still going with the snark. “You really never shut up, do you?”</p><p>“No, it’s pathological. Incurable. But honestly, I don’t think it’s possible for me to talk too much. The world should consider it a blessing that they get to hear my voice,” the older woman brags.</p><p>The muscles within the entrance to her cunt ripple around Rio’s fingerpads, and another pulse of slick soaks them in preparation for penetration. Agatha’s hips twitch with the withheld urge to squirm, and she ends up trying to roll her shoulders instead, head tilted back and eyes fluttering closed.</p><p>“Let’s carry on, I’m green before you have to ask. I’m wet and you’re tempted to fist me, I get the picture. S’not so nice for me, though. These leggings are uncomfortable when they’re wet,” she grumbles under her breath.</p><p>Not so nice for her? Rio huffs, and pulls her hand away. Well, now she’s just pissed off. The dom in her is particularly displeased by that careless comment, especially after she has been so forgiving, and so thoughtfully decided to change the scene plan for Agatha’s enjoyment.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes shoot open, her head falling back down, and she stares at her, affronted. Rio slaps her wet hand down onto her sub’s crotch, directly over her clit, hard enough to make her recoil in shock with a sharp cry.</p><p>“Whiny ungrateful bitch,” she growls.</p><p>“You say with exasperation in your voice,” the older woman scoffs. “You <i>love</i> it, don’t pretend you don’t.”</p><p>Rio ignores her comment and flatly orders, “Get up and take your leggings off.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “Hello? My arms are tied?”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“I can’t get my leggings off with my arms tied behind my back!” she protests.</p><p>Rio sits back and puts her hands behind her head, shrugging nonchalantly. “Sounds like you’re going to need to ask for help.”</p><p>And they <i>both</i> know that Agatha would never do that.</p><p>If she’s going to complain about Rio’s methods <i>again</i>, then she can fix the issue she’s raised herself. Her leggings are wet and uncomfortable to sit in, and she wants to be naked? Fine. Then she can get naked herself. Or <i>beg</i> for Rio to help her.</p><p>No more Little Miss Nice Dom.</p><p>Snarling, Agatha fidgets frantically, wrestling with the knots that restrain her arms behind her back. Rio watches on with a complacent smirk, knowing that she won’t manage to undo them by herself.</p><p>When Agatha comes to that conclusion herself after a solid two minutes of tossing and turning on Rio’s lap, trying to free herself, she scowls, “Oh <i>fuck you</i>. Does this get you off, putting your subs into positions where they humiliate themselves? Fuck, some of them probably get off on it too.”</p><p>She glowers at the younger woman with tigerish intensity, like a predator who is on the verge of pinning her down, plunging her fangs into Rio’s throat, and shaking her furiously until she falls limp.</p><p>What’s scary is that Rio would probably let her.</p><p>“You get off on me calling you a slut and a whore, so I don't think you’re in the position to judge,” she says wryly. “A degradation kink often goes hand in hand with a humiliation kink. Now… take your leggings off. I’m not helping until you get over your inflated sense of pride and ask.”</p><p>Agatha vaults off Rio’s thighs, planting her feet on the floor and, much to Rio’s amusement, trying to use her feet to push her leggings down her calves. “Fine, I’ll do it myself! And I’m taking my underwear off too.”</p><p>Stubborn brat. This evening would honestly run so much smoother if Agatha just… gave in to Rio’s control, submitted, and accepted her help. And yet she is still resisting. It’s actually somewhat impressive that Agatha is still coherent after dropping and rising out of subspace so frequently, because at this point, she must be mentally exhausted. She’s resilient and determined to remain a challenge to Rio, though.</p><p>Rio sits up just so she can snag hold of a handful of Agatha’s hair, tugging on it in reproval. “No, I didn’t order you to do that, did I?” she warns.</p><p>“Well I’m doing it anyway,” Agatha announces. “There’s no way I can get my leggings off without my thong too. Plus, this is a brand new pair and I don’t want you ripping them.”</p><p>“I’ll rip them if I want to rip them.” She’s planning on stealing them for a trophy, actually, but Agatha doesn’t need to know that. Maybe now she will tear them, just because Agatha nastily insinuated that she would.</p><p>Her sub glances back at her with an outraged glare. “No, you will not, these cost over two hundred dollars!”</p><p>What the actual hell? “What thong costs over two hundred dollars!?” Rio asks in disbelief. Was gold thread used to detail it? Are there diamonds encrusted on the waistband or something? It’s literally a <i>scrap</i> of lace.</p><p>“Well I don’t know where you’re getting your lingerie from but I splash my cash on good quality shit, because I refuse to get vaginal infections or rashes from terrible underwear,” Agatha grunts, rolling onto her side and wriggling, using the friction from the bedsheets to work her leggings down. “They’re coming off, I don’t care what you say.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows shoot up into her hairline as she sees that Agatha’s floundering is actually working, and she has her leggings (and thong) down to her knees already. It gives her an absolutely stunning view of her client’s pale ass. Rio bites her lip, stomping down her immediate desire to lunge and chomp her teeth into the pert muscle. Agatha is the unruly untameable beast of the two of them… Rio can’t start giving in to her more animalistic desires. <i>One</i> of them has to remain civilised.</p><p>“You’re ridiculous. You know you <i>could</i> just ask for help,” Rio suggests.</p><p>“I don’t need help! I can do it myself. And if you’re gonna be naked from the waist down then I want to be as well,” Agatha insists, rolling over - and then promptly falling off the bed.</p><p>Alarmed, Rio scoots to the edge of the mattress to check she hasn’t hurt herself - and then is forced to cover her mouth to stifle an outburst of laughter, seeing Agatha lying on the floor and fucking pinwheeling herself in a clockwise direction.</p><p>Her leggings and thong are now stuck around her ankles. She looks so stupid. Like she’s performing the worst-ever breakdance known to man, except the gruff, guttural sounds she’s making would make it an NSFW production.</p><p>“Plus, less strain on your wrist and a much better view,” Agatha adds between deep inhalations, to get more oxygen into her lungs. Then, with one last triumphant kick of her legs upwards, she sends her leggings and thong flying into a pathetic pile in front of the bedside table. Agatha springs to her feet with a crow of victory. “See? I did it!” she cries, with a jubilant beaming grin and shining eyes.</p><p>“Look at that. You did,” Rio says dryly. In a harder, deeper voice, she orders sternly, “You think I’m impressed with your little show, you slut? You’ve wasted your time and mine. Now get back on my fucking lap and shut the fuck up before I get out the duct tape.”</p><p>Agatha’s gleeful expression rapidly morphs into one of awkwardness hesitance, after being scolded. Rio was expecting more pushback - another curled lip, more snappy retorts. Instead, Agatha looks uncertain, almost wary. Just from her rigid body language, the dom can tell that her sub’s fight or flight has kicked in.</p><p>Rio wipes the displeased, contemptuous sneer off her face. “Too far?” she checks gently. “Yellow?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha replies with a dismissive smile, but she’s clearly lying. “Green as fucking grass. I’ve bought your time, it’s mine to waste.”</p><p>She makes a mental note. Agatha seems agitated by the idea of her having wasted Rio’s time. Perhaps somebody has implied to her in the past that she’s not worth the effort or time, and is too much of a bother and too difficult to deal with.</p><p>Truthfully, Rio is getting not just irritated, but <i>angry</i> on Agatha’s behalf, because whoever her ex-girlfriend is, and whoever has obviously mistreated her in the past… their words have done lasting damage to Agatha and are obviously impacting her psyche when it comes to willing submission. She’s beginning to realize that her sub’s sarcasm and bratty behavior may be defense mechanisms.</p><p>The pieces are beginning to come together in her head. Maybe Agatha struggles so much with submission because she doesn’t view it as a relaxing thing. She views it as a time she is opening herself up to being vulnerable, at somebody else’s mercy, which she can’t stand.</p><p>Submitting triggers her to enter survival mode, which is why she fights and reacts as if her dom is the enemy. Perhaps there’s a chance that she’s even been hurt whilst submitting before, physically or emotionally, which is why she has raised her protective walls so high, refusing to let them down.</p><p>They’ll have to address it. The last thing she wants is for Agatha to feel like she’s in danger during these sessions.</p><p>Rio jolts back into the present when Agatha’s weight drops down into her lap once again, making them both bounce on the mattress. The faint heady smell of her cunt, which Rio is now afforded a full frontal view of, fills the air, and Rio feels her own pussy instantaneously dampen at the musky scent.</p><p>She drifts back into dom headspace as she uses steady fingers to tenderly spread out and examine her sub’s pussy. Agatha’s clit is prominent and swollen, a tiny red bead exposed to the air, and her labia are on the slightly larger side so that they frame her entrance beautifully; it’s probably why she got so turned on and wet just by humping a pillow earlier, because she would have been easily able to stimulate her clit by thrusting forward.</p><p>Rio licks her lips as she traces circles around her clit without ever actually touching it, and then probes a single fingertip into the older woman’s weeping hole. She watches as it sinks inside without resistance and listens to the blissful sound of Agatha’s hitched, whistling breathing, feeling her thighs begin to quiver.</p><p>Rio peers up at her in reverence. Her sub’s half-lidded eyes have been watching her every move, and they darken considerably when Rio meets her thirsty gaze.</p><p>The dom lowers her lips to one of Agatha’s lace-covered breasts, lathing the hardened nipple with her tongue before she informs her with a cruel smirk, “I was going to stretch your pussy out with my fingers, but I’m rethinking that now considering the constant back talk.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stutters. “I mean, if you <i>really</i> want to shut me up, you should put them in my ass - oh Jesus fucking Christ,” Her eyes slam shut and her teeth sink into her lower lip when Rio pushes her finger deeper, until it reaches her second knuckle, and then withdraws, before very slowly thrusting it in again. “Fuck - that’s - I want them inside of me,” she squeaks.</p><p>“Say please.” When Agatha presses her lips together, Rio narrows her eyes. God, is she <i>still</i> gonna act like a rude asshole, even with her dom’s fingers shoved inside of her? “Agatha, <i>say please</i>. Be a good girl and use those manners I now know you have, but very selectively use. I think I deserve some respect for putting up with your bullshit today.”</p><p>“<i>You’re</i> bullshit,” the lawyer mutters, barely audible, and then hisses when Rio uses her spare hand to pinch her asscheek, <i>hard</i>. “Alright, alright! <i>Please</i>,” Agatha grits out unwillingly. “<i>PLEASE</i> put your fingers inside of me, Rio.”</p><p>Warmth licks within her lower belly at the sound of her sub’s sweet begging. How can she say no to her now? Rio fucks that single finger deeper until it’s buried in her tight wet heat. Agatha feels <i>incredible</i> around her, achingly hot and soft, and so responsive, her walls fluttering upon the intrusion.</p><p>“How’s that feel, sweetheart?” she coos, heartbeat pounding in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha tips forward until her forehead rests against Rio’s shoulder, and she mouths at her neck, licking at her collarbone. She trills in pleasure as Rio begins to slowly plunge her finger in and out of Agatha’s pussy, dragging her fingertip against the sub’s upper wall as she does so to ignite all of the nerves there.</p><p>“Not terrible,” she breathes.</p><p>“And just to prove to you that I know my way around a vagina unlike some of those other doms you’ve had…” Rio crooks her finger, stroking against a slightly thicker, rougher patch of hot flesh.</p><p>Agatha reacts as if she’s been electrocuted, her hips jerking forward. “AH!”</p><p>“Bullseye. That’s your G-spot, right there,” Rio purrs, tapping it repeatedly and reveling in the way it makes Agatha’s pussy clench wildly around her digit. Her free hand lifts to wrap around Agatha’s neck, applying light pressure to assert full control. “No map needed, baby.”</p><p>“God, I never suggested you’d need one, don’t put words in my mouth,” Agatha chokes out. “Congratulations, you passed the exam. You can locate both the clit and the G-spot. Full marks. You want a fucking certificate of authentication or something? Rio Vidal, MLes, Master’s in Lesbianism.”</p><p>“Oh, if there’s a specialist degree for that then I’ve got a PhD.” Rio snorts a laugh and twirls her finger inside Agatha’s cunt, feeling her walls rippling around it, and then presses more firmly for a second on her G-spot.</p><p>It makes the older woman buck wildly and release a low, feral growl, demanding, “Do that again!”</p><p>She hums. “No, I don’t think so. I think I’m going to wait until I think you’ve truly earned stimulation on your clit and G-spot. Until I think you truly appreciate how kind of a dom I am to gift you my fingers. Most of my subs don’t get any penetration whatsoever until the second session.”</p><p>“Yes, well, we both know I’m a very special case,” Agatha grins wolfishly. “Now <i>do it again</i>.”</p><p>“<i>STOP</i> trying to tell me what to do and take control,” the dom asserts sternly. “Your only job tonight is to submit and take what I give you. Do you understand?”</p><p>Her sub’s expression distorts into a disgruntled lour. “I understand.”</p><p>She squeezes her hand around Agatha’s neck, grinning in triumph when she releases a quiet, bashful whimper. “I want you so desperate to come that you beg.”</p><p>The brunette clenches her teeth. “Fucking <i>sadist</i>.”</p><p>She has a front-row seat to watching Agatha gradually float down into the serene pool of total pliability and fulfillment that is subspace, as she thrusts one singular finger in and out of her and occasionally tightens her grasp on her throat. Agatha’s entire body begins to relax, not going completely limp, but all of her tension leaching out of her muscles.</p><p>Her blue eyes become distant and clouded, as if she’s falling into a trance. She gives into her bodily instincts entirely, freely undulating her hips as her head lolls down on her dom’s shoulder, her lips brushing against Rio’s carotid in the resemblance of tiny love kisses.</p><p>“What do you want, Agatha?” Rio asks her. “What do you need?”</p><p>“More,” Agatha gasps greedily, her cunt sucking Rio’s finger in and pulsing, demanding to be filled. “More, more.”</p><p>“More? Oh no, you’re getting greedy,” Rio teases.</p><p>“Wanna be full,” Agatha groans. “Wanna feel full. Need more fingers.”</p><p>“I give you however many I want. You don’t take.”</p><p>Despite being far down in subspace, Agatha is still bratty enough to whine against her skin in a garbled voice, “Rio, if you don’t give me more fingers then I <i>will</i> bite you again and this time I will not let go.” She scrapes her teeth against the dom’s throat. Well… that won’t do. Rio emits a warning noise and withdraws her finger to Agatha’s entrance, teasing her cunt lips. Agatha collapses forward with a distraught, keening cry. “<i>No no no no please put it back in, please -</i>”</p><p>“I don’t appreciate being threatened, Agatha,” Rio tells her, not unkindly. She uses her hand encasing her sub’s throat to help Agatha straighten her back to sit upright, releasing her neck to tap beneath her chin. She smirks, thrilled, when she sees the beginning of tears forming in her sub’s eyes. “You don’t get to order me around. I give <i>you</i> orders. I decide the pace. I decide how many fingers you get. And right now I don’t know if you deserve a single one for that comment, my bad girl.”</p><p>Rio instantly knows the second the words pass her lips that she’s messed up, because Agatha appears stricken with panic and slumps forward once again, hiding her face in Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“No, please, I can be good,” she gasps, her breathing quickening with agitation, and then she begins to parrot under her breath, as if needing to convince herself, “I can be good, I can be good, I can be good.”</p><p>“Hey. Hey, Agatha. It’s okay,” Rio comforts her, feeling absolutely terrible to have alarmed the older woman. She rubs up and down her sub’s spine, one arm anchored around her waist to pull her into a hug. “I know, I know you can be good. Do you need to safeword? Are you -”</p><p>“Greengreen<i>greengreen</i>,” Agatha interrupts insistently, her voice growing in volume.</p><p>Rio doesn’t agree. She thinks Agatha is yellow, and hesitates, burdened with indecision. Does she call a yellow and pause the scene, or does she push forward, as Agatha very clearly wants her to? What, in the long run, will be better for her sub’s psyche?</p><p>If they take a pause, then she will have the chance to soothe Agatha and calm her down properly - but then Agatha may begin to act up and lash out at her, thinking that Rio is being too lenient and soft on her. She seems like the kind of woman who would utterly despise being pitied and treated as fragile.</p><p>If she stops the scene, when Agatha obviously doesn’t want her to, then she might feel like Rio isn’t listening to her. If they carry on, however, then there’s a risk that Rio’s next mistake will result in a situation where Agatha needs to call red but doesn’t. But if she keeps a careful eye on Agatha’s reactions, then it’s unlikely they will reach that point.</p><p>Rio jerks as a sudden, sharp pain lances through her body, originating from the junction of her shoulder. She immediately buries one hand in Agatha’s thick hair and yanks her head back - forcing her to unlatch her teeth from where she’s sunk them into the dom’s skin.</p><p>“<i>Agatha!</i> For fuck’s sake, stop <i>biting</i> me! I’m not a chew toy! Do you have <i>rabies</i> or something!?”</p><p>“I said <i>GREEN</i>,” Agatha hisses at her, her eyes fiercely blue. “Don’t you fucking <i>dare</i> tap out on me now! I want more fingers and I want you to fuck the <i>shit</i> out of me until I pass out and can’t take anymore!”</p><p>Well, that settles it then. It might not be in her sub’s best interest to carry on with the scene, but she’s made the decision for them - because if they <i>don’t</i> keep going, Agatha is going to tear a chunk out of her shoulder with her teeth. And Rio really doesn’t fancy going to the emergency room later on to get stitches, even if Agatha will have to pay the medical bills.</p><p>Rio snakes her hand around Agatha’s neck to secure her, just so she knows that the unruly sub won’t try and bite her again. The pressure helps calm the older woman and her impatient squirming on top of Rio’s thighs decreases.</p><p>Throwing her head back, Agatha emits a dramatic, needy, pleading whimper, gyrating her hips back and forth on her dom’s lap to try and get some friction on her dripping pussy and throbbing clit.</p><p>“I know you can be good, my pretty girl,” Rio tells her in a low, husky purr. “You’re a quick learner. You realized pretty fast that I enjoy hearing your desperate whimpers and now you’re using them against me.” She pushes the messy, sweaty locks of Agatha’s hair that have fallen over her shoulders to shield her face like a curtain behind her ears. “Luckily for you, I consider myself a very altruistic dom.” Remembering how Agatha begged for more fingers to feel <i>full</i>, a lecherous smirk slowly spreads across Rio’s face. A light bulb goes off in her head with a fresh idea. She smacks her hands down on Agatha’s pale thighs to make her jump, leaving red handprints behind. “Get off my lap and fetch your thong for me from the floor.”</p><p>Agatha frowns at her, bemused. “What?”</p><p>“Agatha,” she clucks her tongue.</p><p>She wrinkles her nose adorably. “But my arms are tied.”</p><p>“Didn’t stop you before from taking it off. I don't care how, but I want you to pick up your thong and give it here.” When Agatha doesn’t respond, simply huffing, Rio grabs a handful of her pubic hair and pulls, until her sub begins to squeak and squirm at the pain.</p><p>“<i>FINE!</i>” Agatha snaps.</p><p>She rocks from side to side until she has the momentum to dismount Rio’s lap, and then slips off the bed to stand. Her arms, tied firmly behind her back, make this task even more difficult for her, but Rio enjoys seeing her struggle and troubleshoot. When Agatha fails to pick her thong up off the floor using her toes, she sniffs and then, with much reluctance, sinks to her knees.</p><p>Rio’s fingers, wet with Agatha’s juices, find their way back into her own cunt before she even realizes what she’s doing. She flicks her clit while watching on with beady eyes as Agatha bends over, her wonderful ass held high in the air, to pick up her thong using her teeth.</p><p>Rio rips her fingers free from her pussy and sags against the headboard with her eyes squeezed shut, because if she catches a single glimpse of Agatha with her thong held in her mouth as she returns to Rio’s lap, she might just spontaneously orgasm, and she can’t have <i>that</i> happening <i>again</i>.</p><p>Agatha drops them into her lap and begins to cautiously clamber back onto the bed to sit on Rio’s lap as she plays with the scrap of sheer purple lace. She knows precisely what she wants to do with it. Collecting saliva in her mouth, she starts to tie the thong into a neat little bundle.</p><p>“If you’re going to rip them to make a point I will be very upset,” Agatha mutters, shuffling back onto her lap as if it’s her favorite seat in the house. “Two hundred dollars in your hands right there, Rio, you could be more - <i>HEY!</i>” she cries out in horror, when Rio plops the pair of panties into her mouth. “Oh my god, are you <i>eating them, you psycho!?</i> You can’t eat my two hundred dollar thong, Rio!”</p><p>She’s not planning on eating them - her plan is to get them completely saturated with her spit. It inadvertently gives her a taste of Agatha’s come, as the lace is still soaked with it from how wet she was earlier, and Rio moans at the salty tanginess that she thinks she could so easily get addicted to.</p><p>Agatha observes her with a disgusted yet fascinated expression as she uses her tongue to push the folded lace around her mouth to get it completely wet, before fishing it out.</p><p>Before Agatha even has the chance to ask what the hell she’s doing, Rio uses her free hand to brace it against her sub’s lower back, forcing her to tilt her hips forward and further expose her drenched cunt. Her pink entrance is weeping, forming a cute little open teardrop.</p><p>Rio smears the balled-up panties against Agatha’s pussy, soaking up her slick while also lubing up her hole with her own saliva.</p><p>And then she uses two digits to shove the thong inside.</p><p>Agatha freezes. She goes completely still, her jaw dropping open in utter astonishment. She stares at Rio with wide, astounded eyes, and Rio stares back, not breaking eye contact as she uses her two fingers to push the thong deeper and deeper inside of her client’s pussy. She scissors her fingers as she does so, the tight warmth yielding and stretching, swallowing everything Rio gives her.</p><p>“There you go, slut. There’s the <i>fullness</i> you want,” she whispers. “Let’s get those panties <i>nice and deep</i>. You feel full enough now, Agatha?”</p><p>“That is not what I meant by full, Rio!” she splutters. Quirking an eyebrow, Rio slips a third finger in alongside her first couple, and Agatha <i>shakes</i> on her lap as if she’s having a seizure, eyes rolling up into the back of her head as Rio’s palm grazes across her clit in the process. “Fucking hell,” she exhales in a croak. “Fuck, <i>fuck</i>.”</p><p>“Too much? But I thought you wanted more,” Rio says teasingly. And then, injecting power and authority into her voice, she orders shortly, “Ride them.”</p><p>“Ride?” Agatha breathes, very clearly overwhelmed.</p><p>“Mm, ride my fingers, Agatha. Like how you fantasized riding my strap,” Rio demands. And… Agatha does. She starts with small rocking motions with her hips, until eventually she begins to bounce, gaining speed as desperate moans pour from her throat. “Up and down, that’s it. Yeah, just like that.”</p><p>Rio keeps her spare hand on Agatha’s back, helping her balance as she lifts herself up and down, her bare ass brushing against Rio’s thighs with every down thrust. She uses her hands, restrained behind her back, to brace herself upon every drop down.</p><p>Her eyes are closed in bliss, but her mouth is agape, and drool dribbles from the corner of her lips, forming a small puddle on Rio’s belly. Rivulets of Agatha’s spit then descend to join the wetness gathered between the dom’s thighs. Agatha’s bed is going to be a soaking wet mess at the end of this session.</p><p>Her sub is a vision. Aphrodite in human form. Her breasts threaten to spill out of her corset bra as she enthusiastically rides Rio’s fingers like she’s competing in a fucking rodeo, her entire body flushed with desire and heat.</p><p>Rio’s fingers glide frictionlessly within her cunt, which has essentially become a swimming pool of Agatha’s slick at this point, and that come is amalgamating with Rio’s own.</p><p>If she just shifts Agatha forward <i>slightly</i>, she’ll be riding Rio’s fingers directly on top of the dom’s own cunt. Unfortunately, she’d have to dislocate her wrist for that to be possible, and it says a lot about her current dominant headspace that she is perfectly willing to try just to experience it.</p><p>“You’re not the only one who got a new strap recently,” Rio continues, entranced by Agatha’s eager movements. “I went on a shopping spree this week to invest your consultancy fee, and picked one out just for you. Seven-inches, galaxy-colored, firm silicone.” She begins to thrust her fingers upwards, <i>hard</i>, and Agatha trembles around her with a thunderous groan. “Next session I’m gonna make you deepthroat it so you realize just how big it is before I use it to <i>ruin</i> you,” Rio tells her, so overtaken by awe that she feels short of breath. “And who knows, maybe I’ll start training that cute little ass of yours with plugs next time too, so you’ll learn to take my strap there as well, cockslut.”</p><p>Agatha’s hips stutter, her ass slapping against Rio’s thighs as she tries to ride her fingers faster, thrusting down <i>deeper</i>, which of course just pushes the thong shoved inside her cunt deeper as well. She must feel so full, with her panties inside her as well as three of her dom’s fingers stretching her out.</p><p>“Gonna come,” she pants.</p><p>Rio tuts. “Not without permission.”</p><p>Agatha pauses at the end of a thrust, Rio’s fingers entirely hilted inside of her, so she can lean forward and snarl, her eyes aflame, “Fuck off, I’ll come when I want to!”</p><p>Baring her teeth, Rio growls back furiously, “Don’t tell me to fuck off while my fingers are inside you.”</p><p>“Don’t <i>stop</i> when I’m getting close then!”</p><p>Brats don’t get rewards. Brats don’t get orgasms, her dom reminds Rio, a tiny voice at the back of her mind. So she begins to withdraw her digits. “I don’t think you deserve an orgasm if you’re going to be ru-ude,” she says in a mocking, sing-song voice.</p><p>Agatha practically <i>throws</i> herself forward, forcing Rio’s fingers back into her pussy up to the second knuckles, face plastered up against her dom’s chest. “NO, wait. I’m sorry. Please, I’m sorry, I’ll be good, I’m sorry, I’ll ask for permission,” she wheezes, frantically gulping down air.</p><p>Narrowing her eyes, Rio scrutinizes her sub’s face, trying to determine if she’s telling the truth. It would be just like Agatha to say she’s going to request permission, and then not actually warn Rio when she’s about to climax. Her simpering <i>seems</i> genuine, but the way she is batting her eyelids and looking dramatically dismayed hints at manipulation.</p><p>“I can see how you’d make an excellent criminal defense lawyer,” Rio comments dryly. “You’re an amazing liar. But you’ll have to lie better than that with me.”</p><p>“Not lying,” Agatha lies.</p><p>“Wanna try that again?” Rio twists and turns her digits, flexing them inside of Agatha in such a way that her nails scrape over her inner walls.</p><p>Agatha shudders, gasping out, “Alright, <i>fine</i>, fine, maybe I lied before. But I swear, I won’t - I won’t come without asking permission first.”</p><p>“I don’t believe you.”</p><p>“You can punish me again if I’m lying!”</p><p>“Hmm,” Rio cocks her head to the side thoughtfully. “Okay. If you come without my say-so today, then next session I won’t let you come at <i>all</i>.”</p><p>Agatha looks disturbed by that idea. “I’ll be good,” her sub croaks. “I’ll behave. Please, just - faster, fuck me faster, and harder. ”</p><p>Deciding to take Agatha’s words in good faith, the dom sinks her three fingers into her cunt and begins to fuck them rapidly back and forth, thrusting hard with upstrokes of her fingertips to brush against her G-spot. Agatha begins to shake so much that she can barely lift her own weight up and down, and so Rio contorts her wrist so she can put more force into pummelling her fingers inside her sub’s pussy.</p><p>“Your cunt’s so hungry, it’s swallowing my fingers so easily, Agatha. Are you gonna squirt your juices all over my hand like an insatiable little slut?” she jeers, as Agatha’s breathing speeds up to near hyperventilation. She gathers a wod of saliva in her mouth so she can spit it directly onto Agatha’s face, which triggers her to squeal. “You gonna ride my hand like a nasty whore and soak the black sheets you put on this bed earlier today, when you hoped that I would fuck you so hard that you would cry? That’s what you need, isn’t it? You need to be fucking <i>railed</i> into submission until you’re too exhausted to fight and you’ve come so many times you can’t feel your clit anymore. Horny bitch. Is somebody getting close? Does my dirty girl need to come?”</p><p>“Y-yes!” she stammers. “N-need…” Her jaw snaps shut, her gaze hardening into steel. Begrudgingly, she begins to beg, “Please, please, Rio, <i>please</i>.”</p><p>“Please what?”</p><p>Agatha snarls, enraged. She yanks at the bindings restraining her arms behind her back. “<i>SERIOUSLY?</i>”</p><p>“PLEASE WHAT?” she shouts, deliberately pressing her fingerpads against that rough patch of flesh that makes Agatha go completely <i>feral</i>.</p><p>Agatha rises on her knees and then attempts to <i>body slam</i> herself down onto Rio, all while her dom’s fingers are trapped inside her cunt. “<i>Eat my ass, Vidal,</i>” she growls.</p><p>Honestly, Rio isn’t opposed. At the moment, however, she is struck with a more powerful urge to beat her ass with a riding crop until it’s red and bruised all over. Rio’s spare hand snags a hold of her sub’s hair, using that fistful to wrench her head back, so Agatha has no choice back to back off and collapse back down onto Rio’s lap - forcing her fingers even deeper, nudging her panties so high up her soaked passage that they must nestle against her cervix. A gush of fluids escapes and drenches Rio’s wrist, informing that Agatha is still extremely turned on, despite her anger.</p><p>And god, is she beautiful when she’s simultaneously aroused and furious. Rio wants to surge upwards and fuck her with her fingers until she screams while kissing her to shut her up. In that fleeting moment, Rio doesn’t give a singular <i>fuck</i> about the rules of their contract. She wants to kiss Agatha so desperately that she doesn’t <i>care</i> that she’s not meant to.</p><p>“Do you want to come or not?” Rio says roughly.</p><p>“Who fucking knows at this point!” Agatha howls.</p><p>She tsks in reproach. “Agatha.”</p><p>“YES, yes, I want to come! <i>PLEASE</i> can I come?” she yells.</p><p>Rio smirks. “Please <i>may</i> I -”</p><p>“I WILL STRANGLE YOU.”</p><p>“Oh, but aren’t your hands tied behind your back, as you’ve reminded me twice?” the dom laughs. “Not yet, baby. I don’t think you’re desperate enough yet.”</p><p>Agatha’s defiant expression crumbles as Rio jabs her fingers particularly harshly, so that her nails dig into her G-spot. Rio knows exactly what it feels like; it creates a delicious stinging pain that fans the flames of pleasure, which Agatha will definitely appreciate considering that she is absolutely a masochist.</p><p>She gyrates downward, head falling forward and her messy hair sticking to the sweat on her face as she rasps, “My clit, <i>please Rio</i>, please - touch my clit.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Rio tilts her head with a hum. “Might be too much for you to handle, pretty girl.”</p><p>“<i>TOUCH MY CLIT OR I’LL SUE YOU TO KINGDOM FUCKING COME</i>,” Agatha screams with a murderous expression. “Don’t tell me how much you think I can handle, I can handle your whole <i>FUCKING</i> hand if I want to handle it!”</p><p>“Now that’s no way to speak to your dom,” Rio says sternly, maintaining her high pace of thrusting.</p><p>She doesn’t even need to demand an apology, because Agatha reaches such an intense state of arousal and desperation that she starts to babble with tears in her eyes, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, <i>please let me come!</i>”</p><p>She presses her fingertips firmly into her G-spot, and uses her palm to brush very lightly over her clit. “Come for me, <i>bizcochito</i>,” she whispers.</p><p>Agatha shatters. Her body shakes uncontrollably as pleasure overwhelms her body, her cunt constricting around Rio’s fingers so tightly that she wonders, briefly, if they might break. Her legs are flooded with Agatha’s come, and to Rio’s surprise, she squirts, the force of it almost ejecting the dom’s fingers from her pussy. Her cheeks turn bright red and her brow furrows in a strained but blissful expression.</p><p>Rio doesn’t get to admire it for long, though, because she goes utterly boneless and hides her face in Rio’s shoulder. Sinking her teeth into the meat of her flesh there, Agatha hangs on for dear life as she screams, the sound muffled against her dom’s skin. It hurts, but the pain just heightens Rio’s own elation as she wraps her arm around Agatha’s waist to steady her, gently thrusting her fingers inside her to help her ride out her climax.</p><p>“Yes, Agatha, that’s it. That’s a good girl,” she coaxes her. She strokes up and down her back to praise her, feeling when her orgasm comes to an end as her cunt stops trying to crush her fingers, and the tension bleeds from her body. “Well done. God, that was <i>beautiful</i>. The hottest thing I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>Agatha detaches her teeth from Rio’s shoulder. She’s broken skin this time, her sharp canine indentations pricked with tiny beads of blood. They won’t scar, but they will form little miniscule scabs that Rio will wear with pride. “I did good?” Agatha mumbles, her eyes flitting open but looking foggy and adrift.</p><p>“You did <i>spectacularly</i>,” Rio promises. She’s never seen such a remarkable performance from a sub, in fact. Agatha’s cunt clenches around her fingers, in her post-orgasm haze, and the lawyer’s hips subtly twitch downwards. <i>More</i>, they silently urge. “Oh, somebody is raring to go again. You got another one in you, baby? I’m guessing my good girl is still green then?” she teases.</p><p>Agatha exhales a breathy moan and bobs her head in a nod. “Green, <i>green</i>, keep going. More, give me <i>more</i>.”</p><p>Rio wants nothing more than to see her come again, and again, <i>and again</i>, until she starts begging for mercy. But there’s one more thing she wants first. “Hm, not yet.”</p><p>Scissoring her fingers inside Agatha, Rio snags a hold of the thong tucked up deep inside her cunt, very slowly pulling it out so that Agatha can feel the bulk of it dragging along her walls. Her forehead rests against Rio’s collarbone and a drawn-out coarse whine rips from her throat, her hips stuttering and thighs trembling. The scrap of fabric emerges soaked through, almost as if it’s been dunked into water and allowed to absorb it; it falls with a wet plop onto Rio’s lap.</p><p>“Open wide,” she says mock-seriously, offering Agatha her fingers. They’re dripping with her come. Agatha eyes them with a faint frown, and Rio tuts, pushing at her closed lips until she pries them open. Immediately, she shoves them straight to the back of Agatha’s throat, making her gag. “C’mon, give them a suck. Clean up your mess, dirty girl. It’s just the juices from that drippy little cunt of yours, I’m sure you’ve tasted them before.” Agatha’s nostrils flare like an agitated animal, but she obediently follows Rio's directions, applying gentle suction and twirling her tongue around the digits to clean them. “Good, baby? You taste what a filthy bitch you are?”</p><p>“I taste better than you,” Agatha mutters, once Rio has pulled her fingers clear of her mouth.</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow. “Bold comment for somebody who’s been throwing a tantrum since I told her she’s not allowed to eat me out today.” When Agatha has the audacity to smirk and lift her shoulders in a small shrug, Rio considers, once again, gagging her. And then realizes… she can. The perfect instrument has just landed in her lap - literally. “You know, I think I’ve figured out a way to occupy that mouth of yours while my fingers are busy.”</p><p>When Rio picks up the drenched thong between her fingers, Agatha scoffs. “Are you serio -”</p><p>“Open your fucking mouth before I hold your nose and <i>make you</i>,” Rio spits, grabbing the older woman’s jaw with bruising strength. Exasperation flares in Agatha’s eyes, and for a moment, Rio wonders if she’s going to fight her. Satisfaction washes over her when instead, the lawyer reluctantly opens her mouth. She screws her face up in disdain when Rio fingers the wet thong inside, making sure it settles on her tongue before using a finger to push her chin up, so her mouth clicks shut. “Good girl. You enjoying the taste you say is <i>better than mine</i> now?”</p><p>Agatha glowers at her, her lip curling up. She looks as if she wants to spit the thong back out onto Rio’s face, but the dom’s secure grip on her chin forces her to keep her mouth closed. With her arms restrained behind her, Agatha can’t do anything beyond try and toss her head to loosen Rio’s grasp, but she fails, because the dom uses her other arm, wrapped around her waist, to keep her in place and reduce her squirming.</p><p>“You drop those, and next session you’ll hold them in your mouth for the full scene after I make you squirt yourelf dry,” Rio threatens. “Your <i>only</i> reason for spitting those out, before I tell you that you can, is to safeword. <i>Claro?</i>”</p><p>Agatha huffs unhappily, but nods, her mouth staying shut. And to reward her for listening to her order, Rio slicks up her fingers using the wetness between her own thighs, as well as Agatha’s.</p><p>She can’t resist the urge to lick her digits, hungry to know what they taste like together. The flavor of the two of them mixed together dances over her tastebuds, salty and sweet and sharp, makes her dizzy with need.</p><p>She wets her fingers again, and since Agatha’s mouth is occupied, makes a show of wiggling them in front of her face teasingly, strands of come hanging enticingly between her fingertips. Those three fingers fuck into her sub’s entrance with no problem once again, and then Rio edges her pinky in alongside them, watching in glee as Agatha’s cunt lips stretch to the point of looking white around her hand.</p><p>The strangled sound that Agatha emits in response makes the sadistic side of Rio’s dom immensely pleased, especially when she begins to buck and release choked noises as she grinds her palm into her clit.</p><p>“And now you’re all stretched out, you’re taking all four of my fingers no problem,” she coos. “Good girl, <i>bizcochito</i>, you can come as many times as you want.”</p><p>“<i>Rio</i>,” Agatha cries out, her name distorted since her mouth is full.</p><p>All it takes is a quick crook of her fingers to hit her G-spot once again, and then the lawyer shuddering her way to another crippling orgasm, floundering on her lap and squeezing her knees inwards so that they press in on Rio’s thighs.</p><p>Agatha comes twice more after that, and it doesn’t take long at all. She never really comes down from her previous orgasms, riding the high as she rides Rio’s fingers. Her third climax crashed over her unexpectedly, a ripple on the seashore rather than a crashing wave. Regardless of the intensity of it, it makes her start shivering uncontrollably, and she appears to become utterly overwhelmed by pleasure.</p><p>Subspace creeps in on her, and she actually falls down into Rio’s lap in a limp puddle of a human being, whimpering, “<i>Stop, stop, can’t, too much</i>,” into her neck, the words barely understandable around the thong.</p><p>“Oh, too much, baby?’” she coos. “You’ve had enough? I don’t think so. I think we can manage one more, don’t you?”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, crying. Stop is not her safeword, however, and she does not spit out the panties to call yellow or red. And if she is not safewording, then it’s consent to carry on.</p><p>And god, Rio really, <i>really</i> wants to wring one last climax out of her just to see her crumble.</p><p>After Agatha’s fourth and final orgasm wracks through her, smaller than the last three but no less powerful, it thoroughly winds her, and drains the last of her energy. Agatha flops against Rio’s chest like a wet kitten with a keening wail of defeat; she’s exhausted beyond belief and clearly done for the night. Her mouth falls slack as she wheezes, and the soaked thong tumbles out onto the equally wet mattress.</p><p>Half-conscious, Agatha is too zoned out to plead for more or beg Rio to stop. And therefore too spacey to safeword or properly consent, so Rio calls it for the night. Very slowly, as not to shock her, the dom withdraws her soaked fingers from her sub’s cunt, hushing her quiet fussy weeping. Her slit is puffy and red from overstimulation, looking as if it has been rigorously fucked - which it has. She pops her fingers into her mouth to quickly clean them off, unable to resist stealing one last taste for the night.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio murmurs on repeat. She presses a kiss to the side of Agatha’s head, above her ear, and on top of her sweaty hair. “Such a good girl. Well done. You did amazing. What a sweet, wonderful girl. I’m so proud of you.”</p><p>Rio takes a couple of minutes to calm herself down, rubbing up and down Agatha’s back while steadying her breathing and allowing her adrenaline to gradually fade. Once she feels grounded and composed, she switches straight into aftercare mode.</p><p>Agatha is unresponsive, deep down in subspace, as Rio gently eases her off her lap and onto her side on the mattress. She looks completely wrung out, as if she’s just run a marathon and a half. Fatigued, flushed, and fucked out, she’s no less beautiful than before, but she could definitely use some TLC.</p><p>Silk ropes are untied and her arms are freed. Rio takes some time to tenderly massage her sub’s undoubtedly sore muscles to restore full blood circulation there before placing her in the recovery position. Cracking open a bottle of water and digging out some of the snacks she’s brought along, Rio places them on the bedside table, along with a packet of wet wipes.</p><p>Crawling back onto the mattress, she slots herself into the big spoon position behind the lawyer, one hand resting on her hip and the other cushioning her head. She won’t start touching Agatha again until she comes back to the present; she doesn’t want to do anything to her without her full consent… even though she just had essentially her entire hand shoved up inside her barely ten minutes ago.</p><p>Another five or so minutes pass, and then Agatha begins to twitch, turning her head. She must sense the dom lying behind her because she shifts her hips back, to press up against her. “Rio?” she murmurs.</p><p>“Hey, Agatha,” Rio says softly. She sits up, making sure she remains in contact with her sub while reaching over her to grab the supplies she readied. Carefully, slowly, she helps Agatha sit up too. She’s shaky and wobbly, still partially down in subspace. Agatha blinks rapidly when the cold bottle of water is nudged into her hands. “Water. Drink,” Rio requests.</p><p>She plucks at the attached cap for a few seconds like it’s a fidget toy, and then raises it to her mouth to take a sip. Rio places a single finger beneath it to help support the weight of the bottle, as Agatha’s hands quiver. When she lowers the bottle, Rio has a piece of dried mango in her hand to feed her. Being handfed was something Agatha asked for as part of her aftercare. Rio is all too happy to indulge her.</p><p>“I’m going to clean between your thighs,” Rio tells her, her voice quiet and gentle. “You really should go to the bathroom to pee and shower, but you shouldn’t stand for a little bit, your legs won’t hold your weight.”</p><p>Agatha nods silently, her expression blank as she processes everything that happened. Rio cups her face and rubs her thumb over her cheek affectionately before picking up the wet wipes. She urges Agatha back against the headboard to sit exactly like Rio did earlier, her back supported but legs spread; the position allowed her to carefully and delicately wipe away the residue on her sub’s thighs and outer lips. She avoids touching Agatha’s sensitive and overstimulated clit too much, knowing that it will be painful but <i>not</i> pleasurable anymore.</p><p>“You only came once,” Agatha finally speaks again, a deep frown on her face as she peers down at the dom, who uses a fresh wipe to clean off her abdomen, and then her calves. “Let me -”</p><p>“No, this was about you,” Rio cuts her off, smiling up at her fondly. Using yet another wipe, she settles on the bed beside Agatha, kneeling. She uses smooth, short strokes of the wipe to the sweat on her face. “I’m just a tool for hire, remember? I don’t need to come multiple times to feel good when domming. Don’t worry, I was <i>very</i> satisfied with your stellar performance tonight. Four orgasms in a row, that might be a new record for a first session. Of course you would set a new high score, you overachiever.” She huffs a laugh and adds, “Although I have to admit, it’s fairly obvious that you prefer to dom. You are a <i>huge</i> brat when you don’t get your way.”</p><p>Agatha pouts. “I am not!”</p><p>“You literally threatened to strangle me, and then <i>sue me</i>, in the middle of the scene.”</p><p>“You were being a raging <i>bitch</i> not letting me come!” the lawyer whinges.</p><p>“That’s my <i>job</i>. And you said yes to orgasm denial when I listed it on the scene plan,” Rio reminds her, tossing the used wipes in a pile on the bedside table to throw in the trash later.</p><p>“Didn’t think that meant you’d give me a fucking <i>grammar</i> lesson,” Agatha grumbles. She goes awkwardly still when Rio begins her after-scene check of her limbs and torso. She applies a very mild aloe-based anti-bruise and -burn cream to the hickey on her breast, her ankles, and her wrists, where the silk ropes have rubbed and made them red. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“Aftercare.”</p><p>“You don’t need to do that.”</p><p>Rio glances up at her, debating how to insist on this. Agatha will likely continue to insist she doesn’t need aftercare no matter what Rio tells her. She <i>does</i> need aftercare, but she won’t believe her dom when she says so. So instead, she decides to handle it from a difficult angle. Agatha prefers to give rather than deceive. “You may not think you need it, but have you considered that maybe I do?”</p><p>Agatha’s head jerks. “You?”</p><p>“Guiding my sub through aftercare post-scene helps me avoid topdrop,” Rio informs her quietly.</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha averts her eyes, staring at the floor with an impassive expression. She swallows and then acquiesces, “Okay,” in a small voice.</p><p>And Agatha does not bicker or argue with her after that. She curls up into Rio’s side as they both settle seated up against the headboard, and for an hour, she allows the dom to feed her sips of water from the bottle, little pieces of dried mango, Ritz crackers, and homemade peanut butter and dark chocolate protein balls. Rio is also soothed, her dom pacified, by the opportunity to take care of her sub, helping her recuperate after a physically demanding session.</p><p>Agatha reminds her of a cat lounging out in the sun, basking in rays of light, as she cuddles up to Rio and purrs. Her head rests on the younger woman’s shoulder and she hums contentedly. Mussing her hair, Rio drags her thumb over her sub’s forehead in a calming gesture before feeding her another chocolate-coated protein ball.</p><p>“Not so opposed to aftercare now, are you, milady?” the dom murmurs, her fingertips lingering on Agatha’s lips for a few seconds as the sub licks melted chocolate off them. “I think somebody is lapping up the attention she’s being showered with.”</p><p>“Haven’t been pampered by a dom like this before,” Agatha confesses, sucking a little <i>too</i> long on Rio’s fingers for it to be innocent.</p><p>“Never? Not even by your ex?”</p><p>“She’d go downstairs and drink half a bottle of wine because of how stressed she got trying to wrangle me into submission.” The older woman traces shapes on Rio’s upper thigh, which she quickly realizes are letters. She’s spelling out her name, as if laying a claim to her. Fuck, that’s hot. “Most of the time she never even got me close to coming before she called it. I was ‘bad’ so I didn’t deserve aftercare.”</p><p>Rio’s fury flares once again upon hearing how Agatha has been treated in the past by her dominants. Really, is it <i>any</i> wonder that she has been labeled a bad sub by her ex when she’s never actually been taught what a healthy BDSM relationship should look and feel like? Withholding aftercare from a sub is tantamount to emotional abuse, in Rio’s eyes. Agatha’s ex was a <i>terrible</i> dom, inconsiderate and selfish, from the sound of it. How dare she call Agatha a bad sub?</p><p>“All subs deserve aftercare, whether they’ve been good or bad,” Rio tells her softly. “And you’re not a bad sub, Agatha. I don’t think any sub can ever be categorized as just <i>bad</i>. But you certainly aren’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes grow wet with tears, and she ducks her head with a silent sniffle, clearly hoping that Rio won’t see. She decides not to focus on it, as Agatha would probably feel embarrassed to have it pointed out.</p><p>Instead, Rio briefly leaves the bed to grab her sub’s hairbrush from the nearby dresser; she encourages her to sit up in a cross-legged position so that she can slip in behind her and begin working the comb through her tangled hair, being extremely gentle to avoid tugging on any knots. Agatha closes her eyes, her head lolling back in pleasure.</p><p>“Did you enjoy the session?” Rio asks nervously. The performance review part of the post-session aftercare is always something she gets a little anxious about. She’s confident in her abilities as a dom, and while nobody has ever told her that they hated her work, a couple have been dickish enough to say that she could have done more.</p><p>“You made me come four times with just your fingers,” Agatha chuckles, as if she thinks the question is a ridiculous one. “I worry about your definition of <i>enjoyment</i> if you’re asking me that.”</p><p>“Was there anything you were unsure about?”</p><p>As Rio tilts her head back to brush downwards from the roots of her hair, the older woman mutters, sounding deep in thought, “You used a lot of pet names for me.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio replies, her heart skipping a beat. She called Agatha ‘baby’ a lot without realizing what she was doing. “I tried to stay clear of the ones you told me were a complete ‘no’.”</p><p>“What did you start calling me there at the end?”</p><p>Rio pauses, thinking. “Pretty girl?” she guesses.</p><p>“No, the - the one in Spanish.”</p><p>Thank god she’s sitting <i>behind</i> Agatha right now, because heat flushes her cheeks, and she knows she must look like a tomato. That was <i>definitely</i> a pet name that slipped out accidentally. “Oh, <i>bizcochito?</i>”</p><p>“You better not have been calling me bitch in your mother tongue,” Agatha snarks. “I can just about tolerate it as part of my degradation kink in English.”</p><p>“That’s <i>perra</i> or <i>puta</i>. No, <i>bizcochito</i>, it… means little cake. Any kind of cake, really, in Puerto Rico. Including tres leches, which is super moist and sweet, and covered in whipped cream when you eat it. It’s delicious.” Rio playfully tugs at her hair, teasing, “You know, kinda like your <i>bizcochito</i>,” as she pointedly flicks her eyes down to Agatha’s still exposed and tender-looking pussy.</p><p>Agatha heaves a groan, rubbing her hands over her face. “Oh my god, you’re so fucking cheesy,” she says mournfully. “My dom is a total corndog.”</p><p>“Speaking of which, <i>somebody</i> has a pet play kink that goes way beyond just collars and leashing that I think they weren’t aware of before tonight.” Rio jestingly strokes over Agatha’s hair and then pats her head like she’s a dog. “Am I right? <i>Puppy?</i>”</p><p>Agatha ducks her head, her cheeks pink. “Shut up,” she hisses. “My ex ruined pet play for me when she got <i>wayyy</i> too into calling me kitten all the time. Then she had to go and bring her mommy kink into it and it got so weird, so fast.”</p><p>“Why would it be weird to - <i>OH MY GOD</i>.” Rio jumps two feet into the air above the bed in shock, scrambling away when she feels something warm and furry brush up behind her.</p><p>She wheels around, hairbrush in her hand wielded as a weapon, and her jaw drops. An orange tabby cat with white and grey patches of pur all over his back has gracefully leaped up onto the mattress, his tail twitching from side to side as he cautiously picks his way around the wet patches on the bedspread to curl up on one of the pillows. He kneads biscuits into the cushion for a few seconds before splaying out on his belly, greeting Agatha with a nonchalant ‘<i>mew</i>’.</p><p>“Calm down, it’s just Scratchy,” Agatha says, rolling her eyes. “It got weird because one, my mother was an abusive wicked cunt, and two, because I’m a cat mom.”</p><p>“You have a cat?”</p><p>“Of course I have a cat. I’m a single, high-earning lesbian in my fifties, I think it would be stranger if I <i>didn’t</i> have a cat.”</p><p>Rio takes a step back in horror. “Wait - has he been in here the whole time?” she asks.</p><p>Agatha shrugs, as if she couldn’t care less, and reaches out to muss the feline’s pelt, smiling when he purrs. “He has a little nest he’s made in my closet he likes to nap in, so it wouldn’t surprise me. He’s shy, he likes to watch new people from a distance to assess whether he can trust them before approaching.”</p><p>“You’re telling me that he was <i>watching us?</i>” Oh god, did they traumatize him? Has he been sitting in his little closet nest listening to Agatha’s throaty moans and Rio’s intense dirty talk for hours?</p><p>“Yes, my cat is a voyeur,” Agatha deadpans.</p><p>Rio grimaces. She’s probably lucky, when she thinks about it, that her client’s cat didn’t attack her. She’s never met a sub at their own home before, but she <i>has</i> met with subs in hotel rooms where they have brought their service and protection dogs along. Rio is completely against bestiality and instantly walks out if they ever want to actually involve their animals in play. But often, the sub will just want the animal in the room which is… a little weird, but she doesn't judge. And because of that, she’s had situations before where clients’ pets have become… overprotective, of their owners, when perceiving Rio as ‘attacking’ them.</p><p>Hence why they have added the ‘please inform us if you have a service or protection animal you plan to bring to the session’ on the intake papers for the agency. She has had one sub before who answered no to that question because she considered her dog her son, rather than a pet, and that was… a definite shock to Rio, who rocked up to the arranged AirBnB that day to a Rottweiler barking at her through the gates.</p><p>Agatha’s cat seems… tame, in comparison to her, at least.</p><p>“Oh, stop acting like he’s going to claw your face off just for getting a little rough with me, he’s as gentle as anything,” the lawyer sighs. “He’s called Scratchy to stop people from trying to pick him up and pet him without his or my permission. He’s a rescue and super timid.”</p><p>Whether he’s a timid cat or not, Rio would have much preferred they not carry out BDSM sessions whilst he could be spying on them from the closet. She can’t believe that Agatha decided not to declare her owning a cat to a woman she paid and invited into her home to fuck the shit out of her. “You should have told me. I could have been allergic to cats.”</p><p>“Are you?” Agatha asks flatly.</p><p>“... No.”</p><p>“Then there’s no issue, don’t try and invent one,” the lawyer snorts. Her jaw cracks in a yawn and she scoots to the edge of the bed, stumbling to her feet. Rio hurries to her side to ensure she doesn’t lose balance and fall, but when she sets her hand on Agatha’s arm to steady her, the older woman slaps it away with a scowl. Ouch. “I want a shower. I don’t need you to join me, before you ask. I’m not a toddler - I abhor ageplay - and I can bathe myself.”</p><p>Rio takes a deep breath. It’s normal for subs to become defensive and distant after a session; some of them become distinctly aware of the fact that they have shown a vulnerable side of themself that they find difficult to acknowledge, and so become a little snappy. Rio knows not to take it personally, but the rejection does sting a little more since it’s Agatha and she feels connected to her on a level that she has never before with any previous subs.</p><p>“That’s okay,” the dominatrix says calmly. “But I’ll sit inside the bathroom with you just in case you get dizzy and slip. You’re still recovering from the scene and I don’t want you passing out under the hot water and cracking your head open.”</p><p>Agatha sniffs. “Well, yes, I suppose it would be better to avoid staining my marble floors with my own blood. You’d be the one paying the cleaning fee, after all, considering you would technically be ‘at fault’.”</p><p>Rio ducks inside the bathroom quickly to pee, to ensure she doesn’t get a UTI, and then stands outside the bathroom door as Agatha pisses. Once she hears the toilet flush and the flow of water start, the dom slips inside.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t seem to care about Rio seeing her naked - which makes sense, as she did just have four fingers up inside her making her squirt - and flings her corset bra onto the floor before clambering into the shower, groaning as she steps beneath the steaming water.</p><p>She showers quickly, choosing not to wash her hair, probably because she doesn’t want to go through the fuss of drying it when it’s so late at night. Rio perches on the toilet - lid closed - as she waits for her to finish, focused entirely on listening to Agatha’s fairly sluggish movements; she’s ready to step in and help in as soon as she is required to, if Agatha starts to struggle.</p><p>She peers around the bathroom as she waits; it’s the fanciest bathroom she’s ever been in, with pure white marble countertops, matte black taps, and gold accents. There’s a clawfoot bathtub in the corner by the window, which gives Rio ideas for future sessions, and the walk-in shower Agatha is currently occupying is made of thick frosted glass. Agatha appears as a blurry, foggy figure beneath the streams of water, and Rio tries her hardest not to stare as her client washes between her legs.</p><p>Fortunately, Agatha doesn’t have any issues showering, and when the water shuts off, Rio holds out a towel for her to snatch out of her hand behind the frosted glass. To her surprise, Agatha does accept her hand to aid her in stepping down the small lip, but then shoos her out.</p><p>Hovering in the bedroom awkwardly as she waits for her sub to emerge, feeling anxious to be separated from her side, Rio tries to busy herself by stripping the wet sheets off the bed.</p><p>Scratchy meows loudly in protest when she disturbs him, ears flattened. He flicks his tail, his amber eyes piercing and suspicious. The cat flees into the closet when she attempts to pet him, and Rio sighs, downtrodden. She’ll win Agatha’s cat over eventually, just like she won over Agatha.</p><p>“Do you want to shower?” Agatha asks her bluntly, marching out of the bathroom with her towel wrapped around her body. It’s big enough that she’s actually wrapped it around herself twice, and it hangs down to her calves, much to Rio’s disappointment.</p><p>Rio hesitates. She does feel uncomfortably sticky, even after wiping herself down with a wipe. But she’s stuck in aftercare mode, and her head is telling her that she shouldn’t leave Agatha’s side.</p><p>“You’ll - you’ll be okay by yourself for a minute?” she asks.</p><p>“I don’t need babysitting,” Agatha huffs, digging a new towel out of her closet where her cat is hiding again, and throwing it at Rio’s face. “And frankly, you stink of sex. Do yourself and your car a favor by at least rinsing off.”</p><p>Rio grudgingly nods. She’s brought a change of clothes with her in the form of some thin sweatpants and a ratty, well-worn Fleetwood Mac t-shirt, as well as more comfortable underwear, so she picks those up from her backpack before ducking into the bathroom again. She helps herself to Agatha’s strongly scented passionfruit shower cream and rinses herself off in only a couple of minutes. She dries off and dresses.</p><p>When she steps back out into the bedroom, she’s alarmed to see that Agatha has made the bed up with fresh sheets, but is lying on her front on the mattress, still wrapped in her towel. For a second, Rio panics that she’s passed out.</p><p>“Agatha?” she calls worriedly, hurrying over.</p><p>“What?” her sub grumbles, rolling over and glaring at her.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>“I’m <i>fine</i>.” She yawns, and then yawns again. “I’m just tired. This is… the most tired I’ve been in a while. God, you really fucked me well. I’ll make sure to leave you a five-star review with the agency.”</p><p>Rio exhales in relief. Tired. Not unconscious. Tired subs she has fantastic experience with. “Thank you for that,” she says with a small smile. “If you point me to where your pajamas are, I’ll change you into them.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. “You don’t have to.”</p><p>“I want to.”</p><p>“Why?” the lawyer questions, puzzled, as if she truly cannot understand why anybody would want to show her affection like that.</p><p>Rio bites her lip. It’s a long and convoluted answer, and she doesn’t want to ruin the night by getting into the nitty-gritty details of how she considers herself a service switch. “I like taking care of my subs,” she answers simply.</p><p>“You get off on this?” Agatha eyes her dubiously.</p><p>“No, I don’t - domination isn’t all about sex just like how submission isn’t either,” Rio responds, her shoulders slumping.</p><p>Agatha snorts. “I doubt that.”</p><p>She internally debates how to explain, since Agatha made it very clear to her when she signed their contract that she was only interested in a sexual arrangement between them.</p><p>When she sees Agatha yawn again, stretching her limbs out across the bed in a way that contorts her spine to an insane degree, she comments quietly, “You’re too tired to concentrate on a conversation right now, <i>bizcochito</i>. I usually like to hold an after-scene debrief with my subs after their first session with me to discuss how they think it went and make any necessary changes to their desires and limits lists. How about we talk about this then?” She gets no response. Rio steps closer, concerned once again. “Agatha?”</p><p>She’s asleep. Breathing calmly, steadily, looking completely relaxed. Rio shakes her head, amused, an achingly fond feeling blooming in her heart. If Agatha is feeling calm and safe enough to fall asleep, then the aftercare has worked wonders for her.</p><p>Her movements clinical and efficient, the dom changes her into a pair of silk pajamas that she finds when rooting through the most likely drawers at the end of Agatha’s bed, and then draws the comforter up over Agatha’s slumbering form. She looks so adorable when she’s sleeping, curled up in a loose fetal position and lightly snoring.</p><p>Moving around the room silently, Rio gathers her belongings and crams them back into her backpack. She finds both of their discarded lingerie and takes her own, placing them in a plastic bag so she can wash them as soon as she gets home; Agatha’s, she puts in the laundry basket that’s tucked away in the corner of the bedroom, that her sub has already shoved all the dirty sheets into.</p><p>There’s Advil in the bedside drawer, so she refills the half-empty bottle of water in the bathroom sink and sets it down next to the alarm clock along with the medication.</p><p>She gives Agatha one last checkover, to reassure herself that she’s alright. Her breathing is fine, she’s sleeping restfully, and she doesn’t seem at all hurt beyond strained muscles and soreness.</p><p>Rio swallows heavily as she brushes Agatha’s mane of hair out of her face with her fingertips, gazing down at her vulnerable, sleeping sub with a tight feeling in her chest. “Sweet dreams, Agatha.”</p><p>She departs from the house after collecting her coat, making sure that the door locks behind her. Backpack in her arms, Rio marches to her car with her head lowered.</p><p>This is the part that Rio always hates the most, after a session. It’s her job to dominate a person, yes, and therefore when her job is over, and the session is completed and her client is satisfied, she has to leave. But it always destroys a little tiny piece of her soul that she is never allowed to stay over and fall asleep next to her sub in bed.</p><p>She wants to remain cuddled up to them, and be lulled into unconsciousness by the sound of their calm breathing. But she can’t. These people pay her to be their dom. She is not their girlfriend or partner. They are not in love with her and she is not in love with them.</p><p>This today, however, is another level of that pain entirely. If Rio didn’t know that Agatha is asleep, and she has no way of getting back into her house without waking her, then she would be running back and begging to stay at her side, no matter how forbidden it is. Steeling herself, Rio starts her car’s engine and pulls away from the curb.</p><p>Agatha Harkness may be the snarkiest and most contentious sub she’s ever been hired by… but she’s the only one who has somehow, despite all of Rio’s attempts to remain professional, wormed her way into Rio’s heart.</p><p>She’s invested. <i>Personally</i> invested.</p><p>God, she is in so much trouble.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>After Rio’s first session with Agatha that Friday night, she finds her thoughts constantly straying toward the older woman, her mind consumed by memories of Agatha fighting, crawling, begging, and submitting to her.</p><p>On Saturday, she goes grocery shopping and sees black sheets for sale, and thinks about Agatha tied to her bed, and how her pale skin looked bone white because of the dark comforter. She showers, and thinks about watching Agatha’s blurry figure through frosted glass, her hands caressing her breasts and dipping between her thighs as she cleaned herself.</p><p>She can’t even eat without thinking about Agatha because whenever she manipulates her cutlery in her hands, she flashes back to her sub coming like a geyser around her fingers, crying so prettily from overstimulation.</p><p>Hell, Rio does her laundry, and her face turns beet red as she hand-washes the bodysuit she wore that night, recalling the way Agatha’s <i>stupidly, ridiculously, offensively beautiful</i> blue eyes raked over her like she was a fucking steak the lawyer wanted to devour. At one point, she’s tempted to clamber up onto the washing machine and get herself off using the vibrations, thinking about Agatha in her purple lingerie. She has to take a break before she gets too hot and bothered. Doing fucking <i>laundry</i>.</p><p>She’s cooked. She is genuinely so screwed.</p><p>And frankly, she’s terrified.</p><p>Rio has never, in her entire life, felt such an intensely strong connection to another human being before - let alone one of her clients. Agatha Harkness consumes every waking thought and Rio is concerned that she is developing a borderline obsession. She feels constantly overwhelmed by confusing emotions about Agatha. <i>Why</i> can she not get this woman out of her head?</p><p>She has always craved intimacy and control, hence why she went into the dominatrix profession despite personally being a sub. A swath of doomed relationships throughout her twenties turned her off the idea of finding a long-term partner.</p><p>Rio is convinced that she is cursed and a dark black cloud follows her, ready to descend and ruin close relationships she develops at any moment, because she has been extremely unlucky. Being awarded a sub’s trust and being able to bring them satisfaction and happiness has soothed that deepset desire within her for intimacy, without her needing to risk her heart.</p><p>In this instance, however, Rio is not craving intimacy. She is craving Agatha Harkness. She has known the woman for a little more than a week and barely knows anything about her other than that she’s a lawyer, owns a cat, and struggles with submission because of ADHD and an emotionally abusive ex. Those may be incredibly personal things, but it’s still not much.</p><p>Agatha knows even <i>less</i> about her, and probably doesn’t want to learn anymore considering Rio is essentially her employee right now. She’s invested in their BDSM relationship because she is trying to spite her ex and prove that she can sub, and Rio is helping her reach that goal. She doubts that Agatha feels the same blossoming bond between them that Rio does; the dominatrix is probably just a means to an end for her.</p><p>Rio knows that what she is feeling is dangerous. It’s new, and frightening, and she is sort of at a loss for what to do. What exactly is she feeling for Agatha and why is it so bewildering and all-encompassing and <i>scary</i>?</p><p>It can’t be love. Surely it would be far too early for that, and Rio knows that she can’t fall in love with her. Not when Agatha is paying her for a service that yes, involves intimacy, but more importantly, intimacy that allows kink exploration without attachment. Rio’s heart doesn’t seem to care about ethical implications, though.</p><p>She knows that logically, she should declare a conflict of interest and cancel the contract - maybe even refund Agatha for their last session, as an apology. But she doesn’t know if ‘conflict of interest’ would even be the correct term. Rio is feeling conflicted, yes, but she’s <i>absolutely</i> interested. <i>Too</i> interested, and that’s the issue. And she suspects that her rapidly amplifying emotions might interfere with her current role as Agatha’s dom.</p><p>For her own peace of mind, and safety, she should pull the plug. But Rio doesn’t want to. She doesn’t want safety.</p><p>She wants Agatha.</p><p>On Sunday, it rains, and she’s stuck inside pondering her ethical dilemma. Rio curls up on the couch in her penthouse apartment’s living room, blanket over her lap and green tea in hand, with succulents spread out over the coffee table in front of her.</p><p>One of the greatest parts of earning so much from her job is that she can afford an apartment with floor-to-ceiling windows and a huge balcony, where she’s turned it into a mini urban garden, full of flowers, herbs, and berry-bearing bushes. The inside of her apartment looks like a rainforest, with succulents, ferns, and palms in every nook and cranny.</p><p>She’s been taking cuttings from some of the rare hybridized succulents she has produced in the past to propagate them. It’s a mindless task that she hoped would distract her from thinking about Agatha. It failed, of course.</p><p>Even the fucking plants are making her think about Agatha. She has one Echeveria hybrid that she has cultivated which is a maroon purple with near blackish colored tips, and she is so tempted to name the strain ‘Agatha’ because of the lingerie she wore during their session.</p><p>“God, get a fucking grip, Vidal,” she mutters to herself under her breath. “You’re embarrassing yourself.”</p><p>Her phone chimes, from where it’s currently resting on the armrest of her couch. Rio’s stomach swoops, because there’s only one person on her contacts list she has assigned the Law and Order Special Victims Unit sound effect as a text alert. They texted yesterday a couple of times, mostly Rio checking in on Agatha to ensure that she’s not slipped into subdrop or having any regrets about their scene; Agatha reassured her that she’s fine, and enjoyed it.</p><p>If Agatha is texting her today, on Sunday, then she’s probably asking about their next session. In her eagerness to lunge to pick it up to see what Agatha has sent, Rio accidentally tips over her entire <i>giant</i> bag of succulent potting mix onto the floor, one of her poor blizzard aloe plants goes flying, and she stabs her hand on her Parodia cactus trying to steady herself.</p><p>“<i>FUCK!</i> Fuck fuck fuck fuck,” she curses, her hand throbbing wildly. There’s about half a dozen cactus needles stuck in her palm. “God fucking damn you Agatha Harkness, fuck your stupidly hot face and your blue eyes and your lingerie and - fuck.”</p><p>It’s not exactly fair to blame Rio’s overzealous response on Agatha, but since it is her texting her that got her so excited, and she’s not here to defend herself, she’s free to say it’s Agatha’s fault. It helps her feel slightly less mortified, and Agatha will never know.</p><p>Ignoring her phone and the waiting text message for now, Rio scowls and mutters furiously under her breath about distracting the lawyer can be as she plucks cactus needles from her palm with sterilised tweezers, and then cleans and disinfects the area. She applies some neosporin cream and then applies waterproof liquid bandage, flexing her hand. It doesn’t hurt, but she hopes it heals quickly.</p><p>She rescues her bruised blizzard aloe and uses a dustpan and brush to salvage as much of the spilled potting mix as she can, before hovering up the rest. After washing her hands, Rio plops back down on the couch and swipes up her phone, taking a deep breath as she readies herself for whatever tomfoolery she is likely to get dragged into.</p><p><b>Agatha:</b> <i>Afternoon, Mistress ;) I’m out of the state from Thurs until Sat next week for a case, just FYI. You mentioned some kind of after-scene debrief. If you think it's necessary then it’ll have to be early this week. I work from home tomorrow so if that works for you, you can come around and cross-examine me :o&lt;=8 I’ve been told I’m a tigress on the stand so better have that muzzle you mentioned prepared.</i></p><p><b>Rio:</b> <i>Tomorrow works. 11? Should only take an hour.</i></p><p><b>Agatha:</b> <i>Oh, so desperate to see me? Only been two days and you’re champing at the bit to get your hands on me again. You know you could look me up online if you’re craving some Agatha and want some material for your wank bank ;) I don’t mind. Consider it a perk of being my dom. Or I can send you some naughty pics if you’d like…</i></p><p>Rio’s heart leaps into her throat, and she suddenly feels incredibly hot and sweaty, like she’s been plunged into a sauna. Fucking hell. No client has ever offered to gift her photos before. What kind of pictures is Agatha talking about? Topless ones? Shots of her pussy? Photos of her teasing herself?</p><p>She shakes her head. Nope. Nope, she should definitely not be even <i>considering</i> saying yes, and the fact she did not immediately respond with ‘no’, is probably going to haunt her later.</p><p><b>Rio:</b> <i>Do NOT send me unsolicited nudes, Agatha, or I will block you.</i></p><p><b>Agatha:</b> <i>:( You don’t wanna see my tits? That makes me so sad, Rio. You’re crushing your sub’s hopes and dreams. What a cruel move as my dom.</i></p><p>She’s trying to guilt-trip her? She’s so devious. Well, Rio knows precisely how she can tease Agatha back and give her blue balls. Smirking, she rises to her feet, marching over to her balcony and her garden of flowers.</p><p><b>Rio:</b> <i>Do you want a picture of MY tits?</i></p><p>It takes less than one second for Agatha to reply, and her haste to do so is clearly marked by the presence of spelling errors that make Rio laugh.</p><p><b>Agatha:</b> <i>OBVIUOSYL.</i></p><p>She snaps a photo of a pair of small, compact little shrubs in terracotta pots, covered in funnel-shaped, pale lavendar blue flowers.</p><p><b>Rio:</b> <i>Here you go. My rhododendron blue tits :)</i></p><p>It takes a minute for Agatha to reply. Rio likes to imagine that she’s fuming, pacing back and forth, and huffing like an aggravated feline.</p><p><b>Agatha:</b> <i>Emotional battery, that’s what this is. It’s illegal for you to be such a tease. I could file a lawsuit against you for this. And after I was SO nice to you, giving you permission to jerk off to photos of me online :(</i></p><p><b>Rio:</b> <i>I’m not going to do that. See you tomorrow x</i></p><p>The kiss might be going too far, but she doesn’t care, feeling triumphant that she was able to get on Agatha’s nerves. She sets her phone down smugly. What she would give to be a fly on the wall of Agatha’s house, witnessing her reactions to that text conversation.</p><p>There is something that lingers on her mind, however.</p><p>Agatha told her that she could look up photos of her online, which must mean that Agatha knows there are pictures of her floating about the internet. She practically invited Rio to check them out.</p><p>Rio has worked with some high-caliber, borderline-famous clients before, and she is extremely strict regarding confidentially. Typically, she will never go looking for extra information about their personal lives, and sticks only to what they offer when filling out their intake forms, or tell her themselves. She certainly does not look up photos of them, even if they give her permission - which is never.</p><p>Considering Agatha <i>has</i> given her permission, however… Rio can’t resist the urge to have a sneaky Google.</p><p>She picks her phone back up and checks her browser is switched to private. Typing in <i>Agatha Harkness New York lawyer</i> into the search bar, and switching to the Photos tab, she’s immediately hit with multiple pages of results. It turns out that Agatha is not on the level of ‘celebrity lawyer’, but she is fairly well known - and has attracted an online following. And by online following, she means a bunch of extremely horny lesbians who track down and thirst over pictures that they find of her on Twitter and Instagram.</p><p>The majority of the photos are professional, business-type ones, with Agatha wearing form-fitting suits; pictures that have clearly been taken for law firm promotion, during court, or as she accompanies her defendants at press conferences. Agatha looks like a gorgeous predator in those images, with her penetrating blue eyes and sharp cheekbones, ferocity in her gaze, and her arms caught in motion as she gesticulates wildly to make her argument. She looks fucking <i>hot</i>.</p><p>The photos of Agatha the lesbians are going feral over are more informal ones; blurry shots of her at charity galas and civic dinners where she’s dripping sex and dressed to kill in sleek body-hugging midi dresses with thigh-slits, some off the shoulder and some strapless.</p><p>They’ve just been taken on people’s phones, and often she’s only in the background of shots. But the images catch her in candid poses: sipping at glasses of wine, stepping through doorways, shaking hands with people, talking with her head thrown back as she laughs.</p><p>In these photos, she looks softer. A predator, still, yes, but less like she’s on the hunt, and more like a big graceful cat who is lounging lazily, fully aware of her elegance and power, and owning it effortlessly.</p><p>These are the photos, featuring Agatha’s natural charm and beauty, that Rio saves to her phone, refusing to feel shameful about it.</p><p>That is until later that night, after several whiskeys and an hour or two of trying to plan out her and Agatha’s next session, so she can present an outline to her tomorrow.</p><p>Rio gets so worked up, so utterly turned on, that she pulls up the secret folder of photos up and fucks herself using the new strap she bought specifically for Agatha. Riding the arm of her couch, she thrusts the dildo inside of herself as she imagines riding Agatha like she’s a bucking bronco.</p><p>“<i>Fuck, fuck, Agatha</i>,” she chokes out breathlessly.</p><p>Rio closes her eyes, dizzy and losing herself to subspace as she imagines being pounded into the cushions until she’s suffocating, little more than a convenient warm clasping hole for Agatha to use for her own pleasure. Agatha’s strap would be huge - matching her ego - and it’s the thought of her drilling into Rio at such an angle that she could see it bulge in her belly and jack herself off through Rio’s skin by pressing her hand over her abdomen that brings her to climax.</p><p><i>What a good toy</i>, she imagines Agatha cooing, and then Rio comes all over the couch’s armrest and falls flat on her face on the floor. She lies there, shaking, her orgasm electrifying her nerves and burying the pain.</p><p>She just masturbated and came. To a photo of Agatha. To a photo of a <i>client</i>.</p><p>Thinking about that client strapping her down and using her to get off.</p><p>Yeah. She’s fucked.</p><hr/><p>Agatha’s house looks different during the day, in bright sunlight. It doesn’t look as pristine as the other homes on the row; the paint’s a little faded, and the front lawn’s grass is a bit too long. It makes it less intimidating to approach during daylight hours, despite the fact that there are neighbors along the street out pruning their hedges and walking their dogs and whatever else suburban shit people in upscale neighborhoods like this do when they’re retired or home from home.</p><p>Rio’s sage-colored Mini Cooper sticks out like a sore thumb as she parks up alongside the curb, in front of her client’s house. It still freaks her out a little to be meeting a client at her home, rather than at an Airbnb or hotel. These post-session debriefs typically take place in discreet coffee shops or even bars, where people couldn’t care less what you talk about. She has a feeling that Agatha’s neighbors are a nosy bunch, and they’re likely to start gossiping when they see Rio visit her. So long as it doesn’t blow back on her, she’s indifferent to it.</p><p>She checks her teeth in the car sun visor mirror, to make sure none of the dried pineapple slices she was munching on during the drive over have got stuck between them. Rio also takes a brief second to glance down at herself; she’s dressed comfortably, this time, in a ribbed black tank top and a pair of baggy khaki cargo pants.</p><p>She’s not even bothered with picking lingerie to wear, instead choosing to don grey boxer briefs and a beaten sports bra. In truth, she tried to dress this morning to be as unsexy as possible, not wanting to tempt Agatha into flirting outrageously with her. But knowing Agatha… she’ll flirt with her anyway. And Rio will get flustered and try to hide it.</p><p>Exhaling shakily, Rio steels herself and grabs her bag from the passenger seat, stepping out of the car. She locks up and throws the car keys up and down in her hand as she turns towards Agatha’s house - coming up short when she is obstructed.</p><p>Two boys, maybe six or seven years old, are standing on the sidewalk, staring at her with scrutinizing looks. They both have curly, sandy hair and the same sloping nose, and they look similar enough that Rio would put a bet on them being fraternal twins.</p><p>Twin 1, wearing a red and blue t-shirt and slightly taller than the other, is holding the leash of a small dog sitting at his feet; Twin 2, with wilder hair and wearing a white and green t-shirt, has a skateboard under his arm.</p><p>“Hi,” Twin 1 chirps.</p><p>Rio has never been all that great with kids. Not because she dislikes them, but because she hasn’t had much experience with them. She tends to scare them.</p><p>“Hi,” she echoes lamely, shifting uncomfortably on her feet.</p><p>She tries to step to the side so she can pass by the two kids, but they shuffle along the sidewalk to once again block her, to her annoyance.</p><p>“I’m Tommy. He’s Billy,” Twin 2 says, pointing to Twin 1. “We live next door, on the right.” And he wheels around to point to his house on the left.

“Nice,” she says, for lack of a better response, and then reluctantly, because Twin 1 is staring at her with an intense expression, “I'm Rio.”

Twin 2 - Tommy - turns back around and asks her innocently, “Are you seeing Agatha?”</p><p>Rio blinks. Right, the kids who live next to Agatha <i>would</i> know her name. She contemplates lying, but then realizes there’s no point. They’re about to see her walk straight up to her front door and enter. “I’m parked outside her house so… that would make the most sense.”</p><p>“Are you Agatha’s new girlfriend?” Billy questions shrewdly, narrowing his eyes.</p><p>If Rio had any sort of liquid in her mouth, she would be doing a spit-take. As it happens, she does have a mouthful of saliva, which she promptly begins to choke on as she erupts in nervous laughter. This is not the first time she has been asked if she is the girlfriend or partner of a client, although usually it’s a hotel employee or bartender popping the question - not a snoopy six/seven-year-old kid.</p><p>Usually, she’s happy to play along. She’ll lie, and say she’s a client’s girlfriend. With Agatha, however, it feels <i>wrong</i> to say yes, for some reason that baffles her. Her stomach somersaults at the mere idea of calling herself Agatha’s partner, and she’s uncertain whether that’s with dread or with longing.</p><p>“No, I work with her,” Rio says with a placid shrug. “She’s not my girlfriend.”</p><p>This time, when Rio attempts to slip past the two boys, their wire-haired Jack Russell terrier squares up and yaps at her, making her jump. Billy shushes the dog and pulls at his leash, before asking Rio, “Are you a lawyer too?”</p><p>They’re giving her the ninth degree, huh. “Not everybody who works with Agatha has to be a lawyer as well,” she scoffs.</p><p>“Did you <i>break</i> the law? Is that why you’re working with Agatha? Because you need a lawyer?” Tommy asks her with a beaming grin. He leans in to whisper dramatically, “Are you a criminal?”</p><p><i>Mind your own fucking business</i>, is what Rio wants to reply with, which she knows would be a little harsh to snap at two pre-teens. She doesn’t want these two boys running home to their parents crying about Agatha’s rude new girlfriend, which would only invite further questioning. “And if I am, what’re you two pipsqueaks gonna do about it?” she challenges, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Tommy puffs out his chest, dropping his skateboard to the ground so he can step up onto it and gain a few inches of height. “Our mom’s a police detective,” he brags.</p><p>That’s unfortunate. “Good for her,” Rio lies. She is a firm believer of ACAB but it would be kind of inappropriate to say that to this random child.</p><p>“Our mom really likes Agatha and she’ll arrest you if you’re a criminal,” Tommy continues.</p><p>‘Really likes’ Agatha, huh? What’s that code for? Good friends, or something more? Obviously, these two kids are familiar with Agatha, and for them to know that their mom likes her, they must have either seen them together, or their mom must be talking about her a lot. Could the twins’ mom be one of Agatha’s exes? Rio begins to feel slightly sick. Could she be the ex?</p><p>“Lucky for me, I’m not,” Rio responds, with a gritted-teeth smile. “I’m just helping Agatha out with her work.”</p><p>Tommy tilts his head at her. “Is that why you’re coming around so often? This is the second -“</p><p>“- third -“ Billy interrupts to correct.</p><p>“Third time,” Tommy says, rolling his eyes at his twin. He rolls his skateboard back and forth beneath his foot, and the wheels make an awful grating sound, indicative of them needing to be oiled. Rio resists the urge to kick it out from beneath him. “And the last two times you came in the evening <i>after</i> Mom comes home from work, so you can’t be working too. And today you’re here during the day because Agatha’s working at home.”</p><p>“You can tell us if you’re her new girlfriend,” Billy pipes up, scooping the dog up into his arms, when the irritating little thing keeps straining at its leash, trying to bite at Rio’s ankles. “We can keep it a secret, promise!”</p><p>Something tell her that if she were to tell these two kids that she’s Agatha’s girlfriend, the entirety of Westview would know by the end of the day. But the twins aren’t going to leave her alone unless she gives them an answer.</p><p>“Okay, you caught me,” Rio sighs theatrically. “I am actually a criminal and my hobby is hunting down annoying dogs like yours, and frying them up for tacos. I have special seasoning and everything, that’s what’s in my bag. Agatha is helping me not get caught.” She throws her head back and cackles like a witch, and then lunges toward them, making grabby hands for the terrior in Billy’s arms. “Better run before I start getting hungry!”</p><p>“Noooo, don’t eat Sparky!” Billy shouts in horror, hugging the hug to his chest protectively. He stumbles over his feet as he springs back towards his house, calling out, “<i>Mooooooom!</i>” with his twin following at his heels.</p><p>Pleased with herself, Rio adjusts her backpack - which does not hold special seasoning, but instead a lot of other things that are not suitable for the eyes of little boys - on her shoulder and heads up the path to Agatha’s porch. She’s just about to knock on the door when it swings open, and her client sticks her head out with an intrigued expression.</p><p>Agatha is wearing a dark autumn floral dress that flows around her knees, and she’s barefoot, looking the most casual that Rio has seen her. Undoubtedly she’s wearing lace lingerie beneath the dress, but at least she’s not opening the door only wearing a towel, like last time. Her hair is tied up in a loose, messy bun atop her head, and apart from bold red lipstick, she’s applied minimal make-up.</p><p>Rio finds her eyes zero-ing on those blood-red lips, and she’s struck with the thought of slamming Agatha up against her own front door and kissing her silly, until that lipstick is smeared across both of their faces. She rapidly squashes that thought down and stuffs it inside a box. Nope, completely inappropriate. Her throat bobs and she clears it, before hitting her client with a toothy grin.</p><p>“Is that children screaming, I hear? Music to my ears,” Agatha says wistfully. Opening the door wider, she greets Rio with a teasing, “Are you terrorizing the neighborhood, Lady Death?”</p><p>“Just dealing with a couple of nosy kids who ambushed me at my car,” Rio replies with a shrug. “Aren’t they meant to be at school?”</p><p>She enters the house and follows Agatha into the living room once she’s closed the door. She takes a second to examine her client’s body language. Agatha seems calm and content, but not particularly relaxed. There’s a strange tension she’s holding, almost as if she’s waiting for a pin to drop. Rio cocks her head to the side when she spots Agatha walking a little wonkily. She doesn’t appear injured, although there is obviously still the chance that she’s sore from their Friday session. Rio chalks it up to residual aches and anxiety.</p><p>Humming, Agatha grabs her phone, abandoned on the coffee table, to place it on charge. “They’re on break. And if you’re talking about the twins, unfortunately their favorite pastime is pretending to be police investigators so they get <i>all</i> up the nighbourhood’s business.”</p><p>“And they get away with it because their mom’s the fuzz,” Rio snickers. “Can’t believe you live next to a cop. You defend the criminals she and her boys in blue lock up - how are you not constantly at each other's throats?”</p><p>“Oh, believe me, we are,” Agatha responds, in a dark tone with a curl of her lip. She twitches the curtains of the front bay window aside so she can peer out, craning her neck as if she’s trying to see if the boys are still loitering in front of her property. “Billy and Tommy are annoying little brats, but they’re not bad kids. Shocking, really, considering their mother is a sanctimonious preacher of morality I’d love to push in front of traffic at the first opportunity.” Clapping her hands together, she wheels around and visibly brightens as she offers, “Coffee?”</p><p>Well, Agatha seems… suspiciously upbeat. But Rio’s not one to turn down caffeine. She trails after her client into her kitchen after throwing her backpack onto the couch, jumping up onto the same stool at the breakfast bar that she sat on last time they were here - although Agatha was drinking wine, then.</p><p>“Yes, please. Splash of oat milk, if you have it. If you don’t, black with three sugars.”</p><p>Agatha pauses as she fills a fancy-looking filter coffee machine using a bag of Colombian coffee grounds that claims to be freshly roasted and looks insanely expensive. “<i>Three?</i> Your dentist must adore you. You’ve probably funded a number of trips to Aruba from all the cavities they’ve had to treat,” she says with a disdainful sniff. She sets the coffee to brew while preparing two rustic ceramic mugs. “Can you even <i>taste</i> the coffee beneath all that sugar?”</p><p>“I’m sensitive to bitterness,” Rio explains, propping her chin on her hand as she watches on. Agatha looks very domestic as she rinses a dirty teaspoon in the sink to use, drying it with a teatowel. “Google tells me it’s probably because I’ve inherited one of those bitter taste receptor gene variants. And… yeah, I also have a sweet tooth.” When Agatha pulls a bag of brown sugar out of the cupboard she grabbed her grounds from earlier, pursing her lips unhappily as she hesitates to add so much sugar to Rio’s mug, the dominatrix tells her, “If it offends your sensibilities to serve me coffee that sweet, then I’ll have green tea instead, if you have any. Half a sugar.”</p><p>Agatha actually appears relieved, and after adding one teaspoon of sugar to Rio’s mug, swaps the sugar for a tin of Longjing tea bags. She drops one in the mug and then sets a kettle to boil on the counter. It’s one of those extravagant ones that allows you to set the temperature, which is ideal for green tea to ensure you don’t burn it.</p><p>“Makes sense now, knowing how much sugar you likely consume,” Agatha comments dryly.</p><p>“What makes sense?”</p><p>The lawyer wiggles her eyebrows and deadpans, “Why your pussy tastes like a tropical fruit.”</p><p>“Didn’t hear you complaining at the time. Wait, no, I take that back - you complained <i>constantly</i> that you didn’t get a taste directly from the source,” Rio fires back with a smirk.</p><p>“What can I say? I’m passionate about farm-to-fork consumption. Or more accurately cunt-to-mouth. So much wastage when you get fingers involved.”</p><p>As if summoned by the sound of his human pottering around in the room where he gets fed, Scratchy appears out of the blue, which makes Rio jolt when she feels him brush past her legs. The feline curls his tail elegantly in the air as he pats at Agatha’s foot, <i>mew</i>ing continuously as he begs for attention.</p><p>Agatha scoops him up into her arms, cradling him like a baby in one arm as she scratches under his chin. She sways from side to side by the counter whilst loving on him, and the sight directly punches Rio in the ovaries. <i>I want her to have my babies</i>, a greedy voice announces from the back of her mind and she shakes her head violently until that thought dissipates. Definitely not a professional thought.</p><p>The coffee finishes brewing, so Agatha lowers Scratchy to the ground. To Rio’s surprise, the shy feline winds between her legs and rubs up against her shins in affection before scampering off, disappearing.</p><p>“He likes you,” Agatha says, sounding stunned.</p><p>“Does he not like most people?”</p><p>“He avoids most people like they’ve got the plague.” Her client scrutinizes her with an odd expression. “He’s a great judge of character - hated my ex with a burning passion and shredded her favorite hoodie when they first met. He must get good vibes off of you.”</p><p>Rio can’t help but preen happily. “What can I say, all the pussies love me,” she boasts.</p><p>The lawyer snorts in amusement. “Didn’t know I was hiring a failed comedian as well as a dom.”</p><p>“Made you laugh, didn’t I? So I wouldn’t say ‘failed’.”</p><p>Agatha pours the black liquid into her own mug, taking a sip to test it despite it being scaldingly hot. She doesn’t add anything. The kettle whistles, so she pours the 175°F water over the green tea bag. As she stands and waits for it to steep, she rakes her gaze up and down Rio’s form, licking her lips.</p><p>“Is there a reason you’re dressed like a stoned frat boy?” she asks.</p><p>Rio snorts, hearing that. Cargo pants are pretty gender-neutral in today’s society, as are tank tops. “Today’s an informal chat only, not a session.”</p><p>Agatha is staring at her waist. “Are you wearing boxer briefs?” she questions suddenly.</p><p>She glances down at herself. Her pants are riding a little low because of how she’s sitting on the stool, and it’s exposing the Calvin Klein waistband of her underwear. “Maybe. Why?”</p><p>Sipping at her coffee and dragging her eyes back up to meet Rio’s, she murmurs, “If you’re trying to turn me off with this get-up, you’re failing.” Pink spots have appeared on her cheeks and she’s rocking back and forth on her heels, looking as if she’s rubbing her thighs together beneath her dress.</p><p>She’s very obviously aroused, and the fact that Agatha is aroused by her makes <i>Rio</i> start to feel warm, a light fluttering feeling in her lower abdomen. “You’re attracted to me wearing boxer briefs?” the younger woman questions.</p><p>Agatha scrapes her teeth over her lip. “I’ve seen the body underneath those clothes so I’d be attracted to you wearing a potato sack so long as I knew I could cut it off you later.”</p><p>Rio feels heat blossom within her face hearing that, because it’s not often she is afforded a compliment like that. She is well aware she is pretty, but hearing Agatha say it is different. The lawyer fishes the tea bag out of the hot water and stirs it a couple of times to make sure the sugar is dissolved. She passes it over to Rio, who tastes it and is pleasantly surprised at the mellow, roasted nutty flavor.</p><p>As they depart the kitchen with their mugs in hand to return to the couch, Agatha changes the subject, asking warily, “So how does this post-session discussion thing work? Because I have to tell you, I categorically refuse to participate in performance reviews. If someone asks me how I think I performed, I am going to tell them I was amazing, because I <i>am</i> amazing. I won’t be tricked into degrading myself.”</p><p>Agatha raises her chin confidently as she settles on her armchair. Rio finds herself frowning slightly as she observes how gingerly Agatha sits down and crosses her legs at her ankles. Maybe she was a little <i>too</i> rough with her pussy on Friday, if she’s still sore enough to have difficulty sitting now. She places her cup of tea on the coffee table and takes her own seat on the couch, immediately pulling her right leg up to tuck it beneath her left thigh. Agatha wrinkles her nose, seeing Rio’s Converse on her cushions, but says nothing.</p><p>“This conversation isn’t to rate your performance as a sub, Agatha, it’s to improve communication between the two of us so I can better understand your needs for the next four sessions,” Rio explains patiently. Unzipping her backpack, she rummages around the contents until she finds her little black notebook. “We’ll talk about any concerns we have first, then talk about revised limits. And finally what we think worked well and would like to implement in the future by adding it to our shared interests list.” Peering over at Agatha, who is nursing her coffee with a furrowed brow, she checks, “Does that sound reasonable enough?”</p><p>“God, you’re <i>thorough</i>, aren’t you?” her client complains. “Might need to make my coffee Irish for this conversation.”</p><p>Rio hits her with a stern glare and sits up a little straighter, pushing more of her dom persona to the front. Agatha must spot her altered posture and expression, because she starts, lowering her mug and carefully placing it aside.</p><p>“This is a paid service and I would like you to get something out of it by the end, even if it is just orgasms and proof that your ex was a terrible dom who couldn’t handle you,” the dom informs her seriously.</p><p>She’s expecting her sub to gripe and grouse, and judging by Agatha’s flared nostrils, she briefly contemplates it. But then Agatha seems to realize that there’s no point in arguing and acquiesces in a grumble, “Yes, fine, fine, we can do it your way. What concerns do you have then?”</p><p>Rio silently cheers in victory. As much as she does enjoy her and Agatha’s verbal scraps, she likes it a lot more when her sub backs off and shows her belly, agreeing with what she says and obeying orders, even if she is doing so begrudgingly.</p><p>Flicking her notebook open, Rio finds the correct page and scans it. “Okay, well, speaking of degradation, that’s a good place to begin.” Tapping her finger against her book, she glances up at Agatha. “You have both a degradation kink and a praise kink. What I’ve noticed is that occasionally those two can conflict in the middle of a scene.”</p><p>Agatha leans back in her chair, grasping the rings adorning her fingers and twisting them. If it were anybody else, Rio would think it’s a sign of nerves. Since it’s Agatha, she suspects that it’s her subtle way of stimming. “Not if you’re halfway decent at dirty talk and understand how they work,” she huffs. “I’m fully aware that I am a slut, and I’m proud of it, so being called a dirty whore is validating.” She tosses her head back, stray strands of hair that escaped her bun flicking over her shoulder. “But I’m also an egotistical narcissist so of course I’m going to enjoy being praised.”</p><p>“Calling yourself a narcissist? Somebody is self-aware,” Rio comments.</p><p>Agatha responds with a grin that is <i>all</i> teeth. “I’m a lawyer, sweetheart. We’re all sharks. You <i>have</i> to be a narcissist to swim in my world or you’ll drown.” She lifts one shoulder in a half-hearted shrug, saying dismissively, “Your dirty talk last session was adequate. Don’t try to fix something that’s not broken.”</p><p>Rio is not going to let it go that easily, though. She’s had two days to think about this, and dissect every word that came out of her client’s mouth on Friday night. Maybe she’s overanalyzed the situation, but Agatha presented some very clear, very alarming red flags throughout their session that Rio became aware of at the time, but pushed past because that was what Agatha indicated she wanted and needed.</p><p>Now, they need to discuss them, because Rio will not be so easily convinced to cast a blind eye next time, not when she thinks it could be detrimental to her sub’s mental health if they don’t address it. It may be hard for Agatha to talk about, but it’s Rio’s responsibility as a dom to express her worry for her sub.</p><p>She sighs, and iterates, “Agatha, my concern lies in the fact that I called you a bad girl <i>once</i> and it seemed as if it triggered some unpleasant feelings for you, but you didn’t safeword. You insisted you were green and we continued, but I have experienced some doubts since; I’m not sure that was the right thing to do.”</p><p>Agatha tenses up, and averts her stormy gaze, clenching her jaw. “I was fine.”</p><p>“You were on the verge of a panic attack,” Rio says gently. Agatha bristles, her lip twitching in a sneer. The dominatrix scoots forward on the couch, despising the distance between them, because if they were sitting next to each other, she would rest her hand on the older woman’s knee to reassure her. “Agatha, you know I’m not going to get mad at you if you safeword, right?”</p><p>“You think I care about that?” the lawyer retorts defensively, crossing her arms over her chest tightly.</p><p>Rio shakes her head. “No, I suspect that you think safewording indicates weakness and a lack of resilience, which could not be less true. Having the strength, courage, and mental fortitude to safeword when you need to is something to be commended. It doesn’t mean that you can’t handle any more, it means that you possess a great awareness of your own body and mind’s limits and understand how to communicate them,” she clarifies slowly.</p><p>She can only hope her words get through to Agatha; she does, at least, appear as if she’s listening, turning her head to fix her penetrating azure gaze on the dom. Rio inhales sharply; does she dare tap into one of the suspicions that has developed in her mind over the past two days whilst mentally breaking down their scene? She decides that it’s worth it.</p><p>“I don’t know if you’ve been called weak for safewording with a dom before, but if you <i>were</i>, they were in the wrong, not you,” Rio states.</p><p>Although Agatha does not confirm that this has happened to her previously with words, the fleeting distraught expression that flits over her face is enough proof for Rio. She lowers her gaze to her lap, looking lost in deep thought for a moment. Finally, she shocks Rio by admitting in an achingly small and vulnerable voice, “I don’t like it makes me feel.”</p><p>She pushes past her surprise that Agatha is willingly opening up to her, and comforts her urgently, “That’s normal. But it’ll probably feel better than forcing yourself to continue through a scene that is upsetting you.” Agatha nods, still not raising her eyes from where they stare down at her thighs. She shifts from side to side restlessly as Rio observes her. “Do you want to talk about why me calling you a bad girl was triggering for you?” she asks cautiously. “We don’t have to. You aren’t obligated to tell me anything and it won’t be a deal-breaker if you decide you’d rather keep it private.”</p><p>Agatha swallows. “I’d rather not discuss it,” she mutters.</p><p>It’s trauma-related, that much is evident. Rio does not want to jump to conclusions, but she would guess that it’s likely a trauma response resulting from something during Agatha’s childhood. But she doesn’t press. Agatha has set her line, and Rio will not cross it. “That’s okay. I just need to know that I can trust you to understand and respect your own boundaries,” she assures her.</p><p>The sigh that rips from Agatha’s mouth is weary and tired, and when she finally lifts her head to meet Rio’s gaze, she looks somewhat troubled. “Look, just - avoid scolding me like an errant schoolgirl. If you think I’ve disobeyed or <i>misbehaved</i>,” she spits out the word with far more vitriol than necessary, “Then punish me in actions rather than words. You don’t need to call me a bad sub when you can discipline me for it.”</p><p>“And like I said at the end of our last session, I do not think you are a bad sub,” Rio says firmly. Agatha may be difficult, unruly, and mischievous, but she is not a bad sub. And if she ever meets the woman who told Agatha that, she is going to punch her lights out.</p><p>Agatha hums, picking her coffee back up to sip at it. A small smile plays on her lips. “You’re the only dom I’ve had to ever think so.”</p><p>“I do this for a living, so my opinion trumps theirs,” Rio remarks with a wink, that causes her sub’s smile to widen. “You’ve just got a <i>lot</i> to learn about subbing.”</p><p>Agatha laughs. “No I don’t.”</p><p>“It took me <i>three hours</i> to force you to submit on Friday,” Rio points out exasperatedly.</p><p>“And didn’t it feel <i>so good</i> when you finally earned it?” Agatha coos at her, wiggling her fingers in Rio’s face like she’s a kitten she’s playing with.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have to earn it, you should give me your submission willingly.”</p><p>“Oh, but that makes it all too easy,” Agatha tits. “Come on, you must admit it felt satisfying to have fought to dominate me, and <i>win</i>.”</p><p>Rio stares at her blankly. “I felt like I was kicked to shit and then made to run a marathon.”</p><p>“And you got your big shiny medal at the end,” Agatha sniggers. “Hey, you should be <i>proud</i>. You kept pace with me throughout. Although you might want to improve on tracking my head movements, I was honestly surprised you let me bite you so many times.”</p><p>Rio heaves a sigh. “If this is what you’re like as a sub, I would hate to see what you’re like as a dom. You’re probably insufferable.”</p><p>“What can I say?” Agatha shrugs. “I’m a sadist.”</p><p>Now that Agatha is relaxed again, she checks her notebook for the next point of concern. “We discussed the false safeword issue during our session. You understand now that it’s dangerous for us both if you false safeword, and that safewording is for when you feel unsafe, uncomfortable, or overwhelmed, and need to slow down or stop? <i>NOT</i> when you are faking an itchy back?” she emphasizes.</p><p>“I understand that you are still <i>butthurt</i> that I interrupted you masturbating twice,” Agatha mumbles sarcastically, coffee stream perfuming her face as she takes a long draw from her mug before once again putting it down. “You were punishing me for getting off without your permission, so I punished you for being <i>rude</i> and not letting me eat you out. Don’t dish it out if you can’t take it.”</p><p>Rio tuts strictly. “<i>Agatha</i>,” she says, in her dom voice.</p><p>The lawyer pouts and insists, “My back was actually itchy, you know, so I wasn’t <i>faking it</i>. But, yes, I understand.” She rubs her thumb around the rim of her mug in slow circles, over and over again. She looks distinctly solemn as she adds, “I will safeword only when I need to and I will… <i>work</i> on learning how to recognize that.”</p><p>Rio nods, pleased. “Good. Next session I might check in a little more often than I did before, for my <i>own</i> peace of mind, okay? I just want to tell you now - it’s not because I don’t trust you to know how you are feeling and whether you want the scene to continue. It’s because I have a duty of care for you as your dom.” Agatha quirks an eyebrow, nodding at her to continue. “As the scenes get more intense, it’ll raise the stakes, and I would rather be cautious as we explore riskier kinks. I do not want a situation on my hands where you injure yourself, physically or psychologically.” Flipping to the next page, Rio reads over her notes and sighs. Great. The next topic of discussion will get Agatha’s back up for sure. “Okay. Subspace. We need to talk about it.”</p><p>Agatha groans dramatically, tipping her head back. “Do we have to? I’ve already told you I think it’s a crock of bullshit.”</p><p>“Which is why we have to talk about it,” Rio declares. “Like I said, you have a lot to learn.”</p><p>“I didn’t go to law school for three years to be told my education is lacking,” the older woman sneers.</p><p>“You didn’t go to a school for subs, did you? So don’t try and tell me you know everything there is to know about subbing.”</p><p>“You didn’t go to a school for doms,” Agatha retorts sassily.</p><p>“I did, actually,” Rio smirks. “I have several certifications from attending BDSM courses and workshops. And when you sign up to work for the agency, they give you additional training.”</p><p>Agatha looks incredulous. “Dominatrixes have <i>training?</i>”</p><p>“I do.” Rio winks. “There’s a reason I’m considered one of the best.”</p><p>Reaching into her backpack, Rio withdraws a nondescript black folder, full to the brim of papers. She really debated earlier this morning whether or not she should bring it, but ultimately decided that she should offer Agatha the chance to read it - even if she does end up setting it on fire instead. There’s nothing in the folder that can’t be replaced. She slaps it down on the coffee table and spins it to angle it towards Agatha.</p><p>Her client blinks at the folder in bewilderment. “The fuck is that?”</p><p>Rio maintains a completely impassive expression, despite the urge to laugh at how Agatha is eyeing the folder as if it’s a venomous snake rather than just a binder. “<i>Submission for Dummies</i>, a guide to BDSM and specifically the submission side of it, written by yours truly.”</p><p>Agatha shoots her a disbeliving look, and Rio answers it with a winning smile. Flipping the folder open, she rifles through the contents until she reaches about halfway, and then slides it even closer to the lawyer.</p><p>“Chapter 4 is all about subspace, with collated research articles, first-hand accounts, and even some medical scans.” Rio taps her finger on the page. “I want you to read it. Consider it homework.”</p><p>Agatha snorts. She pushes the folder back, stretching her leg out to use her bare toes. “No.”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio counters. She snaps it closed and arranges it on the table so that Agatha will not be able to lurch forward, grab it, and chuck it away without at least getting up first. She can tell just from Agatha’s enraged eyes that she wants to burn it. “You’re a stubborn ass and I know you are not going to listen to me if I try and convince you that subspace is enjoyable, because you’ve already made your mind up that you don’t want it, need it, or like it. You’re a highly intelligent, free-thinking woman, who can form her own opinions. So I’m not gonna waste time preaching at you, I’m just going to provide educational resources.”</p><p>“And what is your cute little folder going to educate me on?” Agatha sneers.</p><p>“This is going to explain to you the differences between dissociation and subspace, what subspace typically feels like and its benefits to a sub. Chapter 5 also covers aftercare, explaining how it helps a dom-sub pairing recover from a scene and the importance of it, and I’d like you to at least skim-read it.” When Agatha still glowers at the folder scornfully, Rio clucks her tongue to draw her attention, and it works miraculously, Agatha’s eyes darting towards her. She uses a courteous but commanding tone as she asks, “Will you be a good girl for me and give it a go?”</p><p>Her sub aims an irritated look at her. “I know what you’re doing.”</p><p>“What is it you think I’m doing?”</p><p>“Weaponising my praise kink to use it against me,” Agatha says, seething.</p><p>“Yes, I am,” Rio agrees, and Agatha rears up, looking startled that she isn’t going to try and deny it. And why would she? It’s precisely what she’s doing, and she’s not going to lie. Mostly because - “And you’re going to let me. Because if you do read the guide and pass the pop quiz I’m going to set on it with full marks, then I will allow you creative control over one of our future sessions.”</p><p>It took her a while to figure out what to offer to convince Agatha to engage with the assignment, and it only really clicked for Rio during her drive over, what she could put on the table as a reward. Agatha is a dom-leaning switch who is trying to sub, and one of her main struggles with submission is relinquishing control. It’s why she fights and is so defiant during scenes.</p><p>She will claw back every sliver of control presented to her. So what Rio needs to do to incentivize her to behave is to offer her something that she craves if she follows orders, so that she will do what <i>Rio</i> wants.</p><p>And just as Rio predicted that she would, Agatha perks up. She puts her coffee mug down - it’s empty now - and sits up straighter. “Really?” she says, with dubious excitement.</p><p>“Within reason, of course,” she swiftly adds. “But I will allow you to choose the positions and toys.”</p><p>Those are little choices within a session that will be easy enough to work into the scenes that she has already started to plan out. And while Agatha will still be submitting to Rio in the scenes, knowing in the back of her mind that she is the one who chose <i>how</i> to submit, in the form of the positions she’s maneuvered into and the toys she is tortured with, might actually prevent her from acting out so much.</p><p>Agatha drums her fingers on her thighs. “You know the very definition of a pop quiz is that it’s unexpected. You’ve given me a prior warning now.”</p><p>“Yes, I have, because now you know it’s coming and you <i>want</i> to pass it with full marks, you will read the guide, like a good little teacher’s pet,” Rio points out proudly.</p><p>It really is going to be a win-win situation for her. If Agatha doesn’t read the folder, Rio maintains full control of the sessions. If Agatha <i>does</i> read the folder, then she is doing what her dom ordered and further submitting, in order to gain back a tiny bit of control whilst still following Rio’s rules.</p><p>Blanching, the lawyer grits her teeth, an annoyed, frustrated look flashing over her face. But then that irritation fades and she reluctantly forces out, “Well played. I would honestly be insulted if I weren’t impressed at your cunning.”</p><p>Rio picks up her green tea, which has cooled since they started this conversation, and drains it in a few gulps. Wiping her mouth with her bare arm, she smacks her lips together and triumphantly replies, “When one’s sub is an underhanded, sly little vixen, one must learn how to outfox the fox.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitch up into a miniscule smile, but then she schools her expression into one of apathy. “Anything else to address before I <i>die</i> of boredom?”</p><p>“Stop biting me?” Rio suggests.</p><p>Agatha barks out a laugh. “No,” she replies simply.</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. Yeah, that’s what she thought she would say. It would be an absolute marvel if she were to domesticate feral sub Agatha Harkness. There are a couple more things on her list that she would like to discuss, including Agatha’s initial insistence that she didn’t need aftercare, but she can tell that Agatha is at the end of her rope. Her sub will <i>really</i> start to kick up a fuss soon. She closes her notebook for now, tossing it onto the throw pillows.</p><p>She’ll bring up aftercare and discuss it with Agatha at the end of their next session, whilst performing. Hopefully, Agatha will actually read the submission guide and be more open to receiving it. Maybe explaining her actions throughout the process will help Agatha understand why it’s needed.</p><p>“Nothing else we urgently need to address then,” Rio says with a long-suffering sigh. “Did you revise the limits list in our contract? Any amendments?”</p><p>She texted Agatha about it yesterday, shortly after her disastrous evening wanking over her client’s photos like a pervert. She’s hoping that the lawyer will take it more seriously this time and actually list some hard limits.</p><p>An expression of exasperation passing over her face, Agatha clambers to her feet delicately and disappears quickly into the kitchen. Rio jolts on the couch when she sees her client wobble ever so slightly and has to brave herself on the wall, as she walks, as if her legs are threatening to buckle beneath her. But Agatha waves off her concern, as if it’s nothing to be worried about.</p><p>Damn, Rio didn’t think she fucked Agatha <i>that</i> hard on Friday, but maybe it’s been a while since she’s had rough sex and her body is re-adjusting.</p><p>When Agatha returns, she’s much steadier on her feet and has a copy of their contract in hand. She casts it onto the cushions beside Rio for her to pick up, picks up her phone, and then takes a good minute or two to get back into a comfortable position on the armchair, whilst playing around and tapping with something on her phone screen. The frown she’s adorning, paired with the way she’s biting her lip, makes Rio suspect she’s reading emails, since she is technically meant to be working from home.</p><p>Rio flips to the relevant desires and limits section of the contract and is taken aback. “This… looks like a proper soft and hard limits list,” she says, shocked.</p><p>“That’s because it is,” Agatha replies snidely, not glancing up from her phone. “I did some research - and by that, I mean took a deep dive into the miraculous and titillating world of lesbian BDSM porn - and decided that some things should be hard no’s.” She drops the device in her hand into her lap and forces out, with a constipated look, “Our session made me… reflect… on my past relationships with my previous doms.” When Rio tilts her head, puzzled, she elucidates through clenched teeth, “I was told before that having limits made me an unattractive sub.”</p><p>Rio can only stare, upon hearing that, because <i>what the actual fuck</i>.</p><p>She’s too disturbed to speak. What kind of woefully inept, sociopathic, <i>abusive</i> dom tells their sub that expressing boundaries is unappealing? A dom who is one step below a rapist. If the dom who told Agatha that, is also the dom who has convinced her that safewording is something to be ashamed of, Rio wouldn’t be surprised, and once again, she is struck with the strong urge to track the person down and <i>deck</i> them.</p><p>Holy fuck, no wonder Agatha has such a difficult time subbing if <i>this</i> is how she has been treated as a sub in the past.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio calls gently, and waits for the lawyer to look up at her warily. “That’s extremely fucked up and whoever told you that is abusive.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t go that far,” she scoffs under her breath.</p><p>“I would,” Rio argues calmly. “Doms who want blanket permission to do <i>anything</i> to their subs do not care about consent. They don’t care about their sub’s well-being. They are terrible people and I’m sorry anybody ever treated you like that because you deserved to be able to express your limits.” Agatha’s expression distorts, as if she’s momentarily considering disagreeing, but her anger disappears when Rio affirms, raising the contract and waving it, “I’m not gonna get mad at you for anything you’ve put on here.”</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes. “Even if it’s something you’re interested in?”</p><p>Is that what has happened with Agatha before? Has she had doms who have ignored her saying that she doesn’t like things, because they want to do them? “If you’ve done some research then you may have clocked that I’m a service dom,” Rio explains. “If it’s not something you would enjoy, then I’m not interested.”</p><p>Rio peruses the list that Agatha has given her slowly, making sure to commit every one of the limits to memory.</p><p>Her hard limits list is still woefully short, in her opinion, but there are now things on it: burns, scarification, branding, complete sensory deprivation, drowning, abandonment play, ageplay, involving a third party, and anything involving being confined inside something, like a cage, crate or cupboard.</p><p>Tagged on the end, in red pen to emphasize it, is no degradation involving being called ‘bad’, ‘evil’ or ‘wrong’.</p><p>Her soft limits list is slightly shorter, and includes fetishes such as mommy dom/little girl (with a note saying playing as LG is a hard limit), total asphyxiation, objectification, and anything medical play related. She’s underlined no bodily fluids except spit and come. And, to Rio’s surprise and confusion, she’s also listed roleplay.</p><p>“Hey, Agatha,” Rio says, getting her attention. Agatha is fiddling around with her phone again, fidgeting on the armchair. “No roleplay?” she asks, perplexed.</p><p>She stiffens. “If that’s a dealbreaker or something -”</p><p>“No, it’s not - I mean - look, do you mean <i>all</i> roleplay?” Rio cuts her off, lifting a hand. “Because… that includes some of the stuff you’ve listed as interests. Anything feral or puppy play, for example.”</p><p>And from occurred last session, she was fairly certain before - well, right now, that those were types of roleplay that Agatha is <i>very</i> interested in. She requested collaring and leashing, after all, and even expressed her excitement at the idea of being muzzled and treated like a wild animal during their session. For fuck’s sake, Rio has planned out their whole second session to lean into that kink. She can change it, of course, if Agatha needs and wants her to, but <i>does</i> she?</p><p>“That’s fine,” Agatha replies cooly, further contradicting what she’s written on the list. Does she want roleplay or not? “I just don’t want to pretend to be anyone but <i>me</i>.”</p><p>Rio blinks. Agatha’s lost her. What does that even mean? “Right.”</p><p>Agatha groans, obviously spotting her bemusement, because she explains slowly, “I’m fine with you treating me like an animal or asking me to play a part so long as you’re still calling me by <i>my</i> name and not expecting me to pretend to be somebody else.”</p><p>“Why the hell would I do that?” Rio asks, even more mystified.</p><p>Her sub purses her lips. She rises from the armchair and marches into the kitchen, snagging her empty coffee mug and Rio’s drained tea cup as she passes by. Clearly she’s accidentally touched a nerve, and Agatha is going to need a minute to gather her thoughts. She has not entirely shut down or bitten Rio’s head off, though, which she supposes is a good sign.</p><p>Heaving herself to her feet, the dom trails after her sub, leaning against the wall as she watches Agatha pour herself another cup of coffee. Rio wonders if Agatha relies on caffeine and alcohol to combat stress, in lieu of cigarettes or something harder. Do lawyers get drug tested by firms? Agatha probably sees herself above doing recreational drugs, although Rio thinks she would probably benefit from smoking weed.</p><p>She declines the offer for more tea but does accept a glass of ice water. She’ll happily wait for however long it takes for Agatha to feel comfortable to open up to her - and will not take it personally if she’s not ready.</p><p>“One of the things my ex liked me to do was pretend to be her dead husband,” Agatha finally tells her in a flat voice.</p><p>Are they talking about genderplay, wherein somebody roleplays as a different gender during a scene, and like… spectrophilia? Or something <i>far</i> more sinister? “As in… pretend to be a man and a ghost?” she asks dubiously.</p><p>“No, as in, before we were together, she was married. To a man. And he died in 2019. And throughout our three-year relationship, during sex she wanted me to pretend to <i>be him</i>,” Agatha says, deadpan.</p><p>Rio stares.</p><p>Agatha stares back, slurping her coffee loudly.</p><p>“Dude what the fuck,” Rio whispers fiercely, so deeply disturbed that she contemplates making the sign of the cross across her chest, and she’s a fucking atheist.</p><p>“What the fuck indeed,” Agatha chuckles darkly.</p><p>“That’s so messed up I don’t think there is a level of messed up <i>beyond</i> it,” Rio splutters.</p><p>She’s heard of some <i>wild</i> roleplay before, and has participated in some weird shit herself too. There was that one woman who wanted Rio to pretend to be an alien abducting her for experimentation. After two months of constant anal probing, Rio put anything anal play related on her soft limit list for half a year. But that was just strange. It wasn’t <i>pretending-to-be-my-dom’s-dead-husband</i> strange.</p><p>“Why would you -” she begins to ask, dreading the answer.</p><p>“Why would I stay her girlfriend for three years when she was hung up over her dead husband and using me to get her rocks off to the memory of him? Honestly, I still don’t quite know.” Agatha angles her eyes down at the floor, her brow furrowed and a bleak expression on her face. “She was very persuasive. She only started bringing it up around six months into our romantic relationship, once we’d negotiated our BDSM dynamic, and it was only, like, every couple of weeks. She convinced me it was some kind of weird therapy for her.” She shakes her head, admitting bitterly, “I don’t know why I agreed to it.”</p><p>Rio does. She was motivated to please her partner by one very simple thing. “Because you loved her.”</p><p>“<i>Love</i>? No, definitely not. It was lust and convenience,” Agatha denies with a derisive scoff. She crosses her arms, almost as if she’s hugging herself, holding herself together; the coffee mug tips perilously within her grasp. “It wasn’t every time we had sex. But it began to feel like the times that it wasn’t, she was… punishing me. She’d be particularly cruel, or withhold aftercare. She would only ever be sweet and soft and take care of me if I was pretending to be him.”</p><p>Jesus Christ. Rio honestly can’t recall hearing anything as disconcerting and downright <i>menacing</i> as that. Agatha’s ex was suffering from some severe unprocessed grief, but to manipulate and abuse her next partner like that? To <i>use</i> Agatha as a way to hold on to the memories of her dead husband, neglecting all of her needs and feelings? That goes beyond poor mental health. Rio so desperately wants to pull Agatha into a hug, but has a sinking feeling that she would flinch away from an embrace right now.</p><p>“Have you spoken to anybody about this before?” she questions haltingly. There’s lots of research that states that BDSM can be beneficial to one’s psyche, but Rio is a dom, not a mental health professional. She is not equipped nor qualified to provide therapy for her clients and truthfully, it slightly unsettles her to be relied upon in that manner.</p><p>Agatha snorts, swigging coffee back, apparently not caring how it’s hot enough to burn the roof of her mouth. “Who? A therapist? Yeah, no, I don’t do therapy. It’s bad enough that I have to see my psychiatrist every year to get my ADHD meds approved. Got enough head-shrinking as a teenager in the nasty conversion form.”</p><p>“The fuck,” Rio mutters her breath breath in horror. <i>Conversion therapy?</i></p><p>“Oh yeah, my mother was practically a cult leader. Sent me to the nearest conversion camp as soon as my eyes started lingering a little <i>too</i> long on the other girls in my church group.” She knocks a fist against the side of her head with a shit-eating grin. “Failed epically, as you can probably tell. I’m still devastatingly gay. And I’m Pagan now. Hope she’s rolling in her grave. I was sent to see a psychologist <i>once</i> when I was in college, but I was fired.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth drops open and she asks incredulously, “Fired? As a patient?”</p><p>The hell did Agatha do to convince a psychologist to terminate treatment? Knowing her sub’s bratty behavior and arrogant attitude, it was likely due to non-compliance with her treatment plan or using threatening and abusive language.</p><p>“Oh yeah, I read the DSM-5 and decided it would be fun to present with the symptoms of a different condition every session, to see how long it took for them to catch on. Oh, did that kooky old woman <i>hate</i> to see me coming,” Agatha tells her, smiling wickedly, a feral gleam in her blue eyes that makes Rio’s lower belly feel hot and tight. “Took two months before she realised I was talking shit and pulled the plug. I was trying to get diagnosed with clinical lycanthropy. I could have been turning into a wolf and savaging the population every full moon but apparently, I was ‘wasting her valuable time’.” She laughs, and it’s an amused but wretched sound. “So much for duty of care.”</p><p>Any other person would probably be disturbed, and label Agatha as deranged, for doing such a thing. She’s essentially admitted to psychologically fucking with the person who was trying to help her; another therapist might even diagnose her as a psychopath. Rio, however, finds it <i>extremely funny</i>. Agatha is highly talented at playing mind games, and it’s likely what makes her such an excellent lawyer. A teenage version of Agatha messing around with a therapist for her own entertainment, trying to get diagnosed as a <i>werewolf</i>, is actually kind of hilarious.</p><p>“Why am I not at all surprised that eighteen-year-old Agatha Harkness was a menace to society,” Rio chuckles, shaking her head fondly.</p><p>“Excuse me, I’m <i>still</i> a menace, don’t disparage my achievements,” Agatha smirks. “But yeah, after that, no more therapy for me. There’s literally nothing it could offer me.” Rio can’t help but grimace at her with thinly veiled sympathy. Which she instantly realizes is a mistake, because fury flares in Agatha’s eyes, her body tensing, and she snarls out, “Don’t look at me like that. I’m not <i><b>broken</b></i>, Rio,” while slamming her mug down on the counter.</p><p>She raises her hands hastily in surrender, assuring her in the sort of tone she would take to soothe an injured, defensive animal, “I never said you were. I would never describe a person as broken, Agatha, that’s extremely reductive. But it sounds to me as if you were involved in a fairly toxic relationship for three years that, from what I understand, ended… abruptly?” Rio guesses.</p><p>Agatha exhales forcefully, lip twitching up into a snarl, but she looks less like she wants to bite her head off. Okay, so right on the money then. A three-year relationship with a woman who called herself Agatha’s dom, despite being awful at the job, that ended suddenly, and in all probability, in turmoil.</p><p>“It can sometimes be beneficial to discuss the emotional effects such an upheaval can have on your life with a third party - an unbiased and objective professional, who can offer you advice and help if you need it.”</p><p>“Well, <i>I don’t</i>,” Agatha says firmly, less angry now, and more just looking miffed. She marches back out to the living room and slumps onto her armchair, phone in hand. “I’m perfectly fine. I don’t need to be molly-coddled by somebody who’ll just ultimately prescribe me Prozac, tell me to go <i>running</i> - I <i>hate</i> running - and order me to stop drinking alcohol or coffee. Those make up 50% of my diet, I’d develop a complex just from cutting them out. My ex was the one who <i>truly</i> needed therapy - and still needs it, to be honest.”</p><p>Rio can’t bring herself to disagree with that as she drops back down onto the couch. She’s going to get a lot of steps in today if they keep pacing back and forth between rooms, but it seems to be Agatha’s way of working out her frustrated energy - which is better than violence or snapping at Rio.</p><p>“No more therapy talk. It’s a real fucking downer,” her sub grumbles.</p><p>“Okay, fair enough,” Rio agrees. “Thank you for updating your limits list. Everything on there, hard or soft, will be considered prohibited from our sessions unless we have further discussions about it. Does that sound good?”</p><p>Agatha nods sharply and then reaches across to grab the contract, where Rio discarded it earlier on the coffee table. She flips to the next page, where interests and desires are laid out. “Let’s talk interests for future sessions. Because I’ve added shit and I wanna know if we’re on the same page.”</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow. “Okay. Let’s see what ‘shit’ you’ve added.”</p><p>She takes the contact from Agatha and scans over the page. This time, Agatha has actually filled out the section in more detail, and differentiated between soft and hard interests. Hard interests, also labeled ‘desires’ are sexual kinks and preferences that Agatha wants included; things that she has experience with, and has enjoyed before, and so would like to be incorporated into scenes.</p><p>Her desires list is now <i>very</i> long, as Agatha has added a good half a dozen kinks on top of the ones she listed before of degradation play, collaring and leashing (with an added tag of ‘- pet play’), and restraints.</p><p>She’s expanded it to add full body bondage, body worship, and all toys including straps. In a different pen, as if she took time to think about what else she wants to include, she’s tagged on anal play, oral sex and deepthroating, orgasm control including edging, teasing, and forced orgasms, clamps and body jewelry, and also impact play with hands, paddles, and whips.</p><p>She’s not opposed to anything listed. Pulling her notebook into her lap and nudging it open with the pen she also withdraws from her bag, Rio begins to note the kinks down, making notes in the margins of her current bare-bones scene plan for their next session. Some of these would be suitable to explore then.</p><p>“Do you have your own impact play equipment or would you like me to bring my own?” she asks clinically.</p><p>Agatha immediately adorns a thunderous expression. “You are <i>not</i> hitting me with any implements that have struck another person’s bare ass.”</p><p>Rio sighs. “I sanitize and clean everything I use, Agatha.”</p><p>“I don’t give a fuck,” Agatha sniffs. “You use new toys on me or you don’t use any at all.”</p><p>Rio squints at her. Is she imagining things, or is she hearing some strange streak of <i>jealousy</i> in Agatha’s tone? Almost as if she’s jealous that Rio has had other subs before - has explored impact play with them before? Huh. Interesting.</p><p>“You’re the one requesting them,” Rio points out.</p><p>Her sub peers down at her phone, wrinkling her nose as she plays around with the screen. “You can’t deny you wanna whip me like I’m a fucking racehorse. You <i>want</i> to play jockey.” Agatha tilts her head to the side with a smirk. “I guess that would technically make you the one riding me, though. Do you ever dom from the bottom, Rio?”</p><p>She instantly flashes back to her very vivid fantasy she had last night whilst drunk on whiskey - where she daydreamed about riding Agatha like she was a fucking mechanical bull. She loudly clears her throat and tries desperately to ignore Agatha’s clear attempt to rile her up. Continuing to write notes in her pad, she hides her delighted smile when she hears her sub harrumph in disappointment that the dom is not reacting.</p><p>“So you don’t have any impact play toys?” she asks casually.</p><p>The lawyer curls her lip. “Ex took them all in the break-up. Bitch. She stole my favorite flogger.”</p><p>“I’ll acquire some for you, then,” Rio hums. “I always prefer hand spanking first, then we’ll use the paddle.” She’s learned from experience how much pain each instrument can cause, and therefore tends to start off with ones that leave solid red marks, but only sting, rather than actually <i>hurt</i> and result in lasting pain. “Depending on how things go, I may or may not use a riding crop. It’s the harshest, so the most I’ll give you is a couple of welts with it. I have a strong swing so it often causes subs to tap out.” She freezes, and then hits Agatha with a hard, stern glare. “And that is <i>not</i> a challenge. I don’t want you <i>not</i> safewording when you need to, just because you want an ego boost from being the sub who has survived the most hits of a crop.”</p><p>Agatha shoots her a vexed look, but says nothing.</p><p>Beneath her sub’s hard interest list are her soft interests: kinks that she wants to explore, but has limited experience with, or is somewhat hesitant about requesting for play. Agatha has written down breathplay and choking, fisting, strap warming and vaginal plugging at home and in public, and double penetration. Huh, so her sub might be a bit of a size queen.</p><p>Rio tries to maintain a blank expression even though she is stunned to see somnophilia, free use, and consensual non-consent scribbled down. Those are pretty hardcore kinks that Rio typically shies away from with subs she has just started working with on their first five-session contract, but she’s intrigued that Agatha appears to be considering them.</p><p>She clears her throat, and glances up at Agatha, who has started plucking at a stray thread on her dress and chewing on her bottom lip, while tapping her foot impatiently. “So I don’t see anything you’ve listed here being an issue. I’m interested in everything you are, so we are in fact still pretty compatible, dom-sub wise.”</p><p>“Sounds as if we’re a match made in heaven,” Agatha replies, wiggling her eyebrows. “I give <i>and</i> receive, if you were wondering, when it comes to straps.”</p><p>She was not wondering, but that’s… good to know. Rio feels her face heat up. During her masturbation session yesterday, she imagined fucking herself on Agatha’s strap and being called a <i>toy</i>, until she nearly passed out from coming. She hopes that her face doesn’t appear as flushed as she feels, and she subtly adjusts herself on the couch to remove some of the pressure her legs are applying to her clit, which is now throbbing.</p><p>“The only thing would be the last three kinks you’ve written down… the CNC, free use and somnophilia. If you truly wanna include those in future play, we’re going to need to have a prep session in advance, because they’re on the riskier side. I take any fantasies that involve rape, unconsciousness, and sex without strings attached, very seriously.”</p><p>“Strike them off, then, if you’re gonna make such a big deal out of them,” Agatha mutters, rolling her eyes.</p><p>“I’m not going to strike them off, if you are genuinely interested,” Rio says patiently. “But I’m just telling you now, we’ll have a longer conversation in the future about it.”</p><p>She sees that Agatha has already re-signed the contract with today’s date marked on the back page, and so she adds her own signature and the date, to signify that the contract has been updated. Fishing out her phone, she takes a photo scan of it and emails it to herself and to the agency records. Now that’s done, she yanks her backpack across the couch cushions and drops it on the floor in front of her.</p><p>“So I’ve started planning our next session,” she starts.</p><p>“So early?” Agatha teases immediately. “There’s such a thing as too eager.”</p><p>“Like you aren’t <i>dying</i> to know what I’m intending to do to you next week,” Rio fires back. Agatha throws her head back with a cackle like a witch. “And I’ll have you know, I’m changing my rules for you. You seem to struggle the most in sessions when plans are made and they are abruptly changed. Understandable. But you have ADHD, the type where if you know what to expect, you often find yourself understimulated. Am I right?”</p><p>Agatha appears impressed. “You’ve done your research.”</p><p>“I have,” Rio beams. “Would it be safe to say that the meds you’re on increase your libido?”</p><p>“Oh, I’m a full-blown hypersexual,” Agatha says breezily. “My psychiatrist has been trying to up my Adderall dose for years but I’ve never let her.”</p><p>“You crave novelty and excitement. So what we’re gonna do instead is make a <i>very</i> basic plan, and then we’re gonna be spontaneous. We’ll follow guidelines, and our usual rules, but we’ll just go with the flow.” Rio winks, tagging on, “I sense that you tend to thrive on chaos.”</p><p>“Oh, I <i>adore</i> being unpredictable,” Agatha purrs, with an impish grin. She presses her thighs together, rocking from side to side. “I’m <i>loving</i> the sound of this.”</p><p>“Wonderful.” Rio wiggles her eyebrows. “Wanna see the toys I’ve brought you? They’re what I’m planning to use in our next scene.”</p><p>Agatha casts a curious look down at her backpack. “What kind of toys are we talking?”</p><p>Stifling her smile, begins to withdraw objects from her back, carefully laying them out on the coffee table in a line. First, the purple leather collar, followed by a leash of the same color, which is half leather and half chain. Then the shiny metal nipple clamps, which clank as they fall onto the wooden countertop. Finally, Rio whips out a gag - black thermoplastic rubber shaped like a long, thin dog chew toy, which Agatha’s eyes bug out in astonishment upon spotting.</p><p>“Is that a <i>gag?</i>” Agatha asks in fascination, swiping it up from the table to examine it.</p><p>Rio tsks her and leans over to swat her wrist for taking it without permission, but Agatha recoils back to avoid the hit, sticking her tongue out like a misbehaving child. If they were in a scene, Rio would smack her ass, now that she knows impact play is on Agatha’s interests lists. Unfortunately, she’ll just have to wait until next week.</p><p>“Muzzle’s in the mail,” Rio informs her with a little shrug. “Bought that for us to use if it doesn’t arrive in time. Shipping times these days are a travesty.”</p><p>“This’ll prevent me from talking,” Agatha notes, with a pointed look.</p><p>Rio nods. “Yup, that’s a bonus. Stops you from yapping. With your mouth full you won’t be able to speak, so I’ll be giving you a clicker to hold onto; your safeword will be clicking it three times. If you drop it, you can snap or tap your fingers three times instead.”</p><p>Agatha begins to snicker, as she bends the chew toy gag in her hands, testing how flexible it is and also how much the rubber gives under pressure. “You need a piece of equipment to help you shut me up? What, my own panties not good enough anymore?” she sneers, an obvious dig at the fact that Rio had to stuff Agatha’s thong in her mouth last session to stop her from yapping uncontrollably.</p><p>Rio mimes biting at her, which makes her sub jump in place and then scowl. “Need something to occupy your bitey little shark mouth so you stop trying to tear chunks out of my skin,” she says, in a sing-song voice. “Your canines are sharp, Agatha, and I’d much rather you work your frustrations out by chewing on a rubber bone than chomping on <i>me.</i>”</p><p>Agatha tosses the dog bone gag at Rio’s face and turns her focus to the other items on the table as she says mockingly, “Afraid that I’ll bite your dick off if you try to gag me with it instead?”</p><p>Leaning forward, Rio braces her forearms on her knees and lunges to grab Agatha’s wrist when the older woman reaches out to grab at the purple collar. Agatha doesn’t startle, but her gaze does flash up to meet Rio’s, dark and intense.</p><p>“By the time I’ve trained your mouth for a good face-fucking, you won’t <i>want</i> to bite,” Rio murmurs, turning her sub’s wrist over and trailing her fingertips lightly over the visible veins to cause goosebumps. “You’ll keep your jaw hanging open and take it down your throat like a good girl.”</p><p>Agatha swallows, her throat bobbing, and tugs her arm free - the collar and attached leash in hand.</p><p>“You seem <i>very</i> interested in those,” Rio notes.</p><p>Agatha is perhaps the fakest IDGAF-er Rio has ever met in her life, because she’s obviously trying to act like she doesn’t care at all, rolling her eyes and pretending to be disinterested by the collar and leash - when Rio can see from her body language that she is utterly captivated by the feel of them in her hands, testing their weights and the strength of the leather and chain leash.</p><p>Her fingers are playing with the collar buckle as she squeezes her legs together, her breathing slow but shallow, as if she’s controlling it to stop herself from looking too excited.</p><p>“They’re for me to wear?” Agatha questions, glancing at Rio with an unreadable expression.</p><p>“Well, they’re not for me. Purple isn’t my color.”</p><p>It wasn’t all difficult to figure out her sub’s favourite color given the lingerie and clothes she’s worn. Rio is more partial to black and green, herself. Rio cocks her head, confused, when she sees that Agatha’s eyes appear suspiciously moist.</p><p>She asks in bewilderment, “Are you… crying?”</p><p>“<i>NO</i>. How <i>dare you assume</i> - the sheer <i>audacity</i> - I am not crying,” Agatha stammers with faux rage. She is most definitely crying. “I’m just overcome with relief that the obscene amounts of money I’m paying you are being put to good use to buy play items for us.”</p><p>She lowers her eyes, her cheeks a gorgeous shade of pink. Rio bites her tongue, resisting the urge to tease her for getting so emotional about her dom buying her gifts. Agatha is not like her other subs. Evidently, it’s something new to her, and it’s really a tragedy that no other dom has bought toys for her before.</p><p>Turning the collar over in her hands, Agatha asks curiously, “It’s not a regular dog collar, is it?”</p><p>As if she would risk buying Agatha Harkness, who is very obviously a <i>snob</i>, a bog standard pet store dog collar. “No, I value my life,” Rio says dryly. “It’s designed for human use. Purple leather, silk padded. I’m going to get it adjusted to add extra padding to prevent chafing, since I have a feeling you’re gonna be yanking on it a lot.” She grins mischievously and requests, “Look at the tag.”</p><p>There’s a shiny silver metal tag attached that Rio had specially engraved. The lawyer fiddles with the disk and squints down at it to try and read it. As soon as she realizes what’s been etched onto it, Agatha casts her the dirtiest look imaginable.</p><p>“<i>Hilarious</i>,” she snarls.</p><p><i>SUB IN TRAINING</i>, the dog tag decrees on the front side. On the back, the engraving states <i>ALL BARK, EXTRA BITE</i>.</p><p>When she ordered that last week, she was giggling under her breath the whole time, anticipating what Agatha’s reaction would be. The sulky, pissed-off pout on her face right now is exactly what she expected, but somehow even more entertaining.</p><p>Rio snickers under her breath, as she begins to collect all of the toys to return to her bag. It’s just about coming up on an hour, and she doesn’t want to outstay Agatha’s welcome. “Thought you might find that funny,” she says with a wink.</p><p>“Oh yes, I’m clearly tickled pink,” Agatha deadpans. “Laugh it up now, Rio, because next session you’re going to have one <i>hell</i> of a time trying to get this puppy to heel.”</p><p>She has no doubt about that. She’s looking forward to whipping her disobedient little puppy into compliance. Rio puts her hand out to silently ask for Agatha to pass the collar and leash back, but Agatha merely narrows her eyes and turns her nose up, her grip on the collar tightening.</p><p>She’s refusing to hand it over. Shooting her a stern look, Rio snaps her fingers and opens her palm out again, this time more demandingly. The lawyer ignores her, ducking her head and rubbing the collar’s dog tag between her fingers.</p><p>“Agatha,” the dom growls warningly. She scoots forward on the couch until she can just about lean over and grab the end of the leash, tugging it.</p><p>As soon as she tries to yank it, Agatha tightens her grip. “No. It’s mine,” she insists, with a cagey glint in her blue eyes. “You can’t take it back, you said it’s for me.”</p><p>Rio pauses. Okay, so this is not just Agatha throwing a fit to try and rile her up. Agatha is genuinely becoming anxious because she thinks Rio is going to take the collar away - a collar that she just gifted to her. Considering that Agatha admitted that her ex stole her collection of sex and play toys in the past, it’s no wonder that she’s possessive over a toy she’s just been given. It’s classic resource guarding.</p><p>Maybe it would be better for her to give in, and let Agatha keep it. But would that set a good precedent for the future? No… because if she lets Agatha get her own way now just because she’s got her hackles up, she’ll think that she can manipulate Rio the same way by faking being upset.</p><p>“It is for you. I’m not taking it permanently,” Rio promises to her calmly, not withdrawing her hand. “I will bring it back next session, but like I said, I have to get it adjusted for extra padding. Give it here.”</p><p>Agatha stares at her. One of her eyes twitches, and she puckers her lips, as if she’s mentally debating whether or not Rio is telling the truth.</p><p>She snaps her fingers again and points down at the floor, the universal signal for, “Drop it,” which she states in a dominant, unyielding tone.</p><p>It takes a good few seconds, during which Agatha’s annoyed grimace makes it obvious that she’s contemplating testing Rio’s patience, but she does eventually obey, with extreme reluctance. She slaps the collar and leash into Rio’s hand, watching with beady eyes as the dom slips it into her backpack, muttering in frustration, “I’m not a dog.”</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio praises her, which makes Agatha’s ears turn a delicious red, and she follows that up by replying to her sub’s comment about being a dog with a teasing, “Oh, but you follow commands just like one. After throwing a tantrum, yes, but you submit eventually, and look so gorgeous doing so.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks turn pink and she inhales sharply, her eyes fluttering at the second compliment. That praise kink of hers really does hit her hard. She rises swiftly to her feet and once again heads for the kitchen, mumbling, “I need another coffee. Or a fucking drink.”</p><p>Rio raises her head in alarm, about to open her mouth and question whether she should really be having a third cup of coffee in an hour, or consuming alcohol when it's barely noon, when she sees Agatha stumble. She’s lurching to her feet, arms stretched out to catch her, in less than a heartbeat.</p><p>“Whoa, Agatha. Are you okay?” she asked concernedly. She tries to place her hand on Agatha’s arm to help steady her, but her client pushes it away with a scowl, instead leaning against the wall. “That’s the second time you’ve nearly fallen today.”</p><p>Agatha takes a step back; the expression on her face can only be described as <i>hunted</i>. She shifts from side to side, legs pressed together she replies, “I’m fine,” in a strained voice. Then suddenly her knees crumple beneath her and she releases a breathy, grunt-like sound, only remaining upright because of how she’s bracing herself.</p><p>“Okay, no, you’re not,” Rio protests, hands hovering over her sub’s half-collapsed form, feeling almost nauseous from worry. Agatha is shaking and has her eyes closed now. “What’s going on? You’re trembling and you can barely stand, you’re either on the verge of passing out or you’re so worked up you’re about to have an -”</p><p>Rio cuts herself off abruptly, realization crashing into her like a tidal wave. Agatha doesn’t appear to be in pain. She’s been rubbing her thighs together and looking flushed all day. She’s been sitting gingerly, and acting restless.</p><p>She’s <i>horny</i>, not sick. And judging by how she’s squeezing her legs together and fighting back moans… and if she focuses, <i>truly</i> focuses, she thinks she can very faintly hear… buzzing.</p><p>“<i>Oh my god. Oh my fucking god</i>, are you - are you wearing a vibrator or something right now?!”</p><p>Agatha laughs loudly, and it sounds frenzied. She cracks one eye open as she forces herself to straighten up, brimming with amusement. “Ding ding ding, we have a winner,” she chuckles breathlessly. “Damn, you’re more observant than I thought. I was convinced that I could get myself all the way before you caught on.”</p><p>Rio blinks at her in wide-eyed disbelief. Agatha has sat through their <i>entire post-session debrief for the past hour</i> with a fucking <i>vibrator</i> inside of her!? “Why the hell are you wearing a vibrator?” she splutters.</p><p>“To get off, obviously,” Agatha responds, rolling her eyes as if she thinks it’s a stupid question.</p><p>She gravitates over to the couch, which she slumps against with a groan, her hips rolling downwards against one of the pillows. Rio gulps, because her movements are almost hypnotic, and her gaze zeroes in on the hem of her dress and the slivers of thigh she can see just above her knees.</p><p>This cannot be real. She cannot have just spent the last hour chatting with a client about their BDSM relationship and pretty serious topics of safewording and consent, while said client has been <i>masturbating in front of her</i>, without her even knowing it. She cannot be standing in her client’s house, frozen like a statue, staring at her client’s legs after that revelation, and wanting to see <i>more</i>. This cannot actually be real life right now.</p><p>“Writing that list this morning got me all hot and bothered,” Agatha carries on, her fingers grazing over her lower belly and dipping lower, as if she’s holding back from stroking her clit through the fabric of her dress. “It was either I postponed our meeting until next week when I get back - incomprehensible - or rubbed one out whilst you’re here. What would you have preferred?”</p><p>“Postponement!” Rio answers rapidly, rubbing her hands over her face in utter incredulity.</p><p>“You sure? Because you look awfully flushed and you can’t seem to keep your eyes above my waist,” her sub responds, raising an eyebrow. She throws her head back and emits an overdramatized whine, grinding her hips down, and then cackles madly when heat rushes to Rio’s face.</p><p>“This is not professional, Agatha,” Rio attempts to protest, but she knows her voice sounds pathetically weak. And it’s weak because she is <i>enjoying this</i>. She’s enjoying watching Agatha get all flustered and worked up because they just had a conversation about sexual kinks and sex toys while she’s been holding a vibrator in her cunt the whole time.</p><p>Agatha settles on the couch, legs kicked up on the coffee table, crossed at the ankle. She hugs one of the throw cushions close to her chest as she subtly rocks her hips to stimulate herself. A lewd grin plastered on her face, she asks cheekily, “What do you want me to do then?”</p><p><i>Stop, go to the bathroom and take it out so we can have a civilized conversation without you masturbating in front of me like a nymphomaniac</i>, is what Rio should say. Instead, her mouth opens and what spills out is a hungry, “Show me.”</p><p>Agatha beams at her triumphantly. She doesn’t hesitate, planting her feet on the floor and raising her hips so she can slip her dress upwards, until it’s bunched around her waist. Rio slinks around to the other side of the room, holding her breath, so that she can get a view of the lawyer from the opposite side of the coffee table.</p><p>Agatha observes her like a panther hunting a gazelle, her dark eyes tracking Rio’s movements; she slowly spreads her legs, slipping down her back on the couch until her ass is hanging over the edge, so she can brace her feet against the coffee table.</p><p><i>What are you doing what are you doing what are you doing</i>, Rio’s internal monologue screams. She squashes it, her heart pounding.</p><p>Rio nearly faints on the spot when she sees that Agatha has forgone wearing underwear. Her pussy is on full display, dripping and swollen. The thick, curly hair of her bush appears even darker than its usual brunette and appears saturated with wetness.</p><p>It could, of course, be lube, but she doubts it; just from the thick, heady smell that permeates the air the moment she widens her legs, Rio can tell that it’s all Agatha. It’s a miracle she hasn’t smeared her own juices over her armchair - and Rio is aghast that she didn’t notice the scent of Agatha’s cunt in the air, because it’s dizzyingly addicting.</p><p>“You’ve been going commando this whole time?” she asks in a croaky voice, her senses overwhelmed by the cloying aroma of <i>AgathaAgathaAgatha</i>.</p><p>“I wondered how long it would take for you to notice,” Agatha murmurs, her fingertips combing through her public hair to lightly trace over her clit. “Must have done a great job at hiding it because you didn’t even suspect, did you?”</p><p>She didn’t. Rio had no clue. In the position Agatha is holding herself in, she can sneak a peek inside her hole and see a hint of the black wearable internal vibrator she has tucked up in her clenching vagina.</p><p>It’s nowhere near as bulky as the majority of G-spot vibes for sale, and Rio would hedge a bet on it being one of the longer, slender wearables that have just hit the market. She can now properly hear how it’s thrumming, proof that Agatha has indeed been masturbating with it on this entire time.</p><p>But that’s not the only thing she’s wearing. Rio just about suffers a heart attack, and is immediately so turned on that she can barely speak, feeling her boxer briefs beginning to get wet. It’s slightly difficult to see because of the angle, but Agatha’s tight wrinkled asshole has been stretched open and adorned with a purple amethyst anal plug.</p><p>“Oh <i>fuck</i>,” Rio chokes out, her head fuzzy with arousal. She’s struggling to <i>think</i> she’s so aroused, and can’t resist any longer - she slips a hand down the front of her cargo parts, past the waistband of her boxer briefs, to begin petting her aching, throbbing clit. “Agatha, I think you forgot to mention something when you admitted to holding a vibrator inside your cunt.”</p><p>It’s not even one of the smaller training plugs that Rio would usually start her subs on; from the size of the glass gem, it looks like a full-blown medium-sized plug, and it’s frankly <i>insane</i> that Agatha has been able to <i>sit normally</i> with the thing shoved inside her ass. No wonder she was fidgeting so much.</p><p>“What can I say? After you shoved four fingers up inside my pussy on Friday, my ass was feeling a bit empty and neglected,” the lawyer says feverishly.</p><p>She’s watching Rio’s hand move beneath her pants with half-lidded, greedy eyes, licking her lips. Her fingertips trail down from her clit to press into her entrance, bumping up against the vibe inside of her, making her hips jerk. The plug in her ass jolts as she clenches down on it, and Rio bites back a whimper at the sight.</p><p>“Do you like it?” Agatha asks, in a panting, hopeful voice.</p><p>“I love it,” Rio tells her assertively. She moves closer, her feet moving her until she’s standing directly next to her sub. “Agatha Harkness is wearing a pretty princess plug in her sweet asshole because she’s a salacious little slut who likes to feel <i>full</i>,” she purrs, and Agatha shivers, head lolling back awkwardly against the cushions as she flicks her clit faster, her breathing speeding it. “How are you controlling the vibrator?” Rio questions.</p><p>Agatha drags her eyes over to her phone, which is lying innocently on the armrest of the armchair. “Hmm, it’s bluetooth. Got it set on a cycle right now, so it goes between off, low vibration, and high vibration.”</p><p>Bluetooth. So every time Agatha was fiddling around with her phone earlier, tapping at the screen with such an intense expression… Rio laughs. “God, and here I was thinking you were answering important legal emails and instead you were playing around with the toy in your filthy pussy,” she murmurs.</p><p>Her dirty talk triggers Agatha to whine, swirling tighter circles around her clit. Her slick has dribbled down her perineum, around her butt plug, and onto the couch below. Before Rio realizes precisely what she’s doing, and what boundary she’s crossing, she reaches out and skims her fingers over Agatha’s upper thigh, a mere inch away from her puffy pussy lips.</p><p>Agatha’s hips buck upon her touch, and a strangled feral sound escapes her lips when Rio lifts those slick-soaked fingers to her mouth, humming at Agatha’s taste as she pushes her other hand’s fingers into her entrance.</p><p>“You’re drenched. What a dirty slut, walking around without underwear, <i>desperately</i> hoping that your dom would see and give you some attention,” Rio tells her darkly.</p><p>“You better be planning to fucking do something or I might just have to use that leash in your bag to choke you out and sit on your face,” Agatha wheezes, lashing out with her leg to try and kick her in the crotch.</p><p>Rio moves quickly, dodging out of the way and seizing hold of Agatha’s calves. She forces her legs upwards until she’s pinning her ankles to the couch’s back cushions; Agatha’s spine curves as she’s pressed into the half-Nelson position, her cunt now facing upwards, mouthing thirstily at her fingers, and the butt plug bobbing within her ass.</p><p>Rio’s mouth waters at the sight of her sub’s weeping pussy visibly pulsing; what she wouldn’t give to get her tongue inside there and feel the vibrator quivering against the tip of the muscle until she licks Agatha to completion.</p><p>“Don’t try and take control,” Rio hisses, shifting forwards until she can lift her knee and rest it on the couch, pushing up against Agatha’s ass to nudge at the butt plug. Agatha chokes at the sensation, squirming beneath her. “You know that won’t get you anywhere. You behave and you <i>earn</i> your pleasure.”</p><p>Agatha stares up at her with nearly black eyes, tongue darting out to wet her dry lips as she breathes raggedly. “Are we calling this a session?”</p><p><i>Of course</i>, is Rio’s instinctive response, but then she freezes. Shit. Shit, <i>shit, SHIT</i>. This is not a session. This is their post-session debrief, and they are <i>not</i> meant to be having sex.</p><p>She forgot for a moment, there. This isn’t meant to be a scene. What the hell is she doing? She got so invested in Agatha’s teasing and blatant exhibitionism that she lost herself, overcome with lust and a desire to devour Agatha whole.</p><p>Rio releases Agatha’s legs, backing up until the backs of her calves hit the coffee table. Agatha slowly lowers her legs back down to place her feet on the coffee table again, to bracket the dom and trap her in. It’s lucky that Rio is not particularly claustrophobic, because she’ll need to step up and over her legs to free herself from Agatha’s cage.</p><p>“No. Not a session,” Rio mutters, pulling her hand out of her pants and wiping her fingers dry on her cargo pants. She’s still turned on, but the heat is muted and cooled by her rising anxiety over such a huge misstep. She shakily runs her other hand over her face, biting her nails nervously. “This goes way beyond the scope of our contract.”</p><p>Agatha tilts her head at her, examining her carefully. She’s stopped masturbating, simply resting her hand over her cunt. “Double-checked it this morning, didn’t see anything about forbidding sex outside of scenes,” she says, unruffled.</p><p>“It’s not the <i>contract</i>, Agatha, fuck,” Rio groans. If it were the contract then she would be in <i>actual</i> trouble, especially if Agatha decided to sue her for breaching it. No, this comes down to her morals. “This breaks all of my rules against fraternizing with clients outside of sessions. You are an ethical nightmare.”</p><p>Agatha sighs theatrically, rolling her eyes. “Oh c’mon, I’m hot, you’re hot. I’m single, and I assume you are too?” she checks.</p><p>Rio nods, her chest tightening. Agatha is not asking if she’s single because she wants to date her, she tries to remind herself. She’s asking because she wants to know if Rio is unattached and therefore free to have casual sex.</p><p>Confirming her suspicions, Agatha shrugs and asks brazenly, “Then what’s the harm? I’m game for some laid-back fooling around independent of our dominant submissive arrangement, if you are. A friends-with-benefits kind of <i>thing</i>. Or dominatrix and client with <i>extra</i> benefits, more accurately.” She points at Rio accusingly. “Just don’t fall in love with me. That would be a real catastrophe.”</p><p>Rio’s racing heart skips a beat. She doesn’t know why, but her mouth is suddenly dry as the Sahara and her forehead breaks out in a cold sweat.</p><p>“That’s a little dramatic,” she says hesitantly, with a forced, airy laugh.</p><p>“Oh, no, it isn’t,” Agatha counters seriously, regarding Rio with complete sour sincerity as she goes on to claim, “I’m a chronic toxic Lesbian Lothario. According to my ex, I have a tendency to drag women into relationships, make them fall in love with me, and then chew them up and spit them out.” Her morose expression morphs into a vicious smile that is all teeth, her eyes piercing. She places her hands behind her head, legs still spread wide to display herself. Her voice drips with sin as she adds slyly, “It would be a shame to break your heart and chase you away this early into our dom-sub dynamic when you are oh-so wonderfully talented at giving orgasms.”</p><p>Rio suddenly wants nothing more than for Agatha to grab her by the scuff of her neck and shake her furiously like a border collie going to town on a rope toy. Should she be worried that the concept of being chewed up and spat out by Agatha is actually making her <i>hornier</i>, rather than turning her off?</p><p>She’s slightly obsessed with Agatha to what might be a fairly concerning degree, but she’s certain that’s just naturally heightened interest. They’ve had sex, after all, and all that oxytocin flooding her veins has prompted her brain to form an attachment to the older woman. Agatha submitted to her so beautifully, in a way that satisfied and soothed the dom in Rio’s head like no other sub has ever done before.</p><p>She’s fascinated by Agatha, yes, and wants to know everything about her, but she’s not in <i>love</i> with her. She can’t be. They’ve only known each other a week. That would be absurd. (Right?)</p><p>“Oh, don’t worry. The falling in love with you thing, that won’t be an issue,” she says with (faux) confidence.</p><p>Maybe she doesn’t sound as self-assured as she thinks she does, because Agatha narrows her eyes, shooting her a dubious look. “You sure? I know I’m roguishly handsome and effortlessly charming.” She cocks her head and tags on, with a smirk, “I wouldn’t blame you for developing a crush.”</p><p>Huh, Agatha seems awfully insistent on this. And considering she is the one bringing up the possibility of a crush, maybe she’s projecting. “Sounds like you <i>want</i> me to fall in love with you,” Rio retorts.</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous,” Agatha scoffs, but she does wiggle on top of the couch, looking jittery. She lowers her arms from behind her head, one hand returning to gently petting at her clit for stimulation, while the other reaches out to claw at Rio’s tank top. She hasn’t realized that she’s shuffled forward until her knees are touching the front of the couch, so it’s easy for Agatha to grab a handful of fabric and yank her closer. “So we’re doing this?” she demands.</p><p><i>YOU SHOULD NOT DO THIS</i>, the voice in Rio’s mind screeches, banging at the walls of her brain. <i>YOU ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A CLIENT, THIS IS COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL. YOU ARE DEVELOPING FEELINGS FOR AGATHA HARKNESS. THIS IS DANGEROUS. THIS IS WRONG.</i></p><p>Rio takes a deep breath.</p><p>If what she is doing is wrong, she doesn’t <i>want</i> to be right.</p><p>She makes her decision, and locks in.</p><p>“Yes, we’re doing this,” she confirms, and just to solidify that choice, she trails her fingers along the lengths of Agatha’s inner thighs, teasing her. “Consider it a reward for being a good sub and revising your limits list when I know you would have rather pulled your own teeth out.” She really was quite impressed that Agatha took the time and had the patience to update those lists, when she was expecting her to turn back around and iterate that she has ‘no limits’ again.</p><p>“Usual rules then?” Agatha purrs, hips beginning to once again thrust upwards desperately, especially when the fingers of Rio’s dominant hand pet her bush and then graze over her pussy. “Traffic light system and safeword for safeword?”</p><p>Rio grins at her when Agatha emits a mangled, frantic noise as the dom flicks at her sub’s prominent red little clit with her forefinger, pushing back the hood of skin to expose it to the air. “Oh, you’re trying to be a <i>very good girl</i> for me, aren’t you?” she coos. Agatha squirms delectably at the praise, her cheeks flushing. “The Agatha from last week didn’t give a flying fuck about safewords but you’re pretending that you do now because you know I like it.”</p><p>“S’in my best interest. You give me more orgasms when you’re pleased with me,” the lawyer gasps out. When Rio draws her fingers away from her clit, returning to stroking along her thighs, she releases a wild, agitated sound, her eyes flashing. Clutching the front of Rio’s tank top, Agatha pulls her forward and down, injecting some gravity into her voice as she hisses, “On your knees.”</p><p>Rio’s knees hit the floor before she can even fully register Agatha’s words. It’s an instinctive response. She can feel the haze of subspace creeping in, making her thoughts feel fuzzy and distant. Agatha’s commanding tone of voice - <i>dominant</i> voice - instantly triggered a submissive response in her so strong that it flipped her from one side of the dynamic spectrum to the other in less than a second.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widen in shock and glee at the sight of Rio kneeling between her legs, head bowed. “<i>Oh!</i>” she crows, thrilled.</p><p>“Shit,” Rio grumbles in response.</p><p>She pulls herself out of headspace by pinching herself hard on the back of her hand, feeling hollow and empty as the sensation fades. She heaves herself back to her feet, having to grip the armrest of the chair because of how unsteady and slightly sick she feels. Fuck, this is exactly why she’s always so cautious about keeping an eye on subs who rapidly fall into and rise out of subspace within scenes. Never before has Rio experienced something like this, though. No, this is <i>all</i> in response to Agatha, and it’s a little horrifying.</p><p>Agatha does not know how to let sleeping dogs lie. “You’re a sub?!” she squeals, looking absolutely ecstatic.</p><p>“I’m a switch,” Rio corrects her bluntly. “But I’m <i>your</i> dom, so don’t get any ideas.”</p><p>Shuffling back on the couch so she can sit up, her feet thudding to the floor, Agatha shakes her head vehemently. “No, no, no, you don’t get to sweep this <i>incredible</i> revelation under the rug,” she protests, her eyes dancing with mirth. “I gave you an order and instead of fighting back and giving me orders in return, like a dom… you <i>obeyed</i>. Like a sub.”</p><p>Rio runs a hand down her face, and groans when she realizes it’s the one she was using to flick at Agatha’s clit earlier, and therefore covered in her juices. Just the <i>smell</i> of Agatha on her hand is nearly enough to send her spiralling out into headspace again, and she’s not sure whether it would be domspace or subspace now, which is disconcerting.</p><p>“I’m a dom on the clock. That’s my job, it’s what people pay me to be. But outside of work hours… <i>yes</i>, I prefer to sub,” she reluctantly admits.</p><p>She never tells her submissive clients that. Why the hell is she telling Agatha? <i>WHY</i> is she opening herself up to be vulnerable with this shark of a lawyer who she cannot get out of her head - who has already managed to convince her to break all of her own rules?</p><p>And then Agatha stuns her by questioning eagerly, “Would you ever sub for me <i>during</i> work hours?”</p><p>Rio stares, not comprehending what she’s asking. Agatha is asking if she will sub… while working as a dominatrix. In her head, <i>sub</i> and <i>work</i> are entirely mutually exclusive - because dominatrixes <i>don’t sub</i>. “What?” she says, lost.</p><p>“Well, think about it, you have this whole <i>thing</i> about helping me improve as a sub,” Agatha says, her tone rife with energy. “What better way to learn how to submit properly than from somebody who has ridden <i>both</i> horses?”</p><p>Why the hell would she risk subbing for Agatha, when she suspects that the lawyer would likely lose <i>all</i> respect for her as her dom after seeing Rio in subspace for her? She shakes her head and states coldly, “I’m not sure that’s such a good idea.”</p><p>Agatha deflates, losing some of her enthusiasm. “Why not? It sounds perfect to me.”</p><p>“That there - that was - that was a <i>slip</i>,” Rio replies, frustrated, but more with herself than with Agatha. It’s her fault that they are having this conversation at all - if only she had better control of her body and didn’t lose it for one fucking second, to fall to her knees in front of the most difficult sub she has ever dealt with. “I don’t sub with clients, Agatha. <i>Ever</i>. It’s a personal rule of mine. And I’ve been willing to bend the rules for you so far, but that is one I refuse to break.”</p><p>Keeping her work life and her personal life separate is the only way she’s been able to remain <i>sane</i> all of the years she’s been doing this job.</p><p>Agatha crosses her arms, raising an eyebrow. “Aren’t you already breaking one of those shatterproof rules by agreeing to have sex with me outside of sessions?”</p><p><i>Touché</i>. “For a lawyer, you are awfully blasé about deviant behavior.”</p><p>“Criminal defense, remember. I don’t encourage violating the law, but I get paid to help people who do to escape the consequences,” Agatha shrugs her shoulders and the motion turns into a full-blown body shudder as the vibrator inside of her ramps up to what must be the high vibration level, causing her to whine between clenched teeth. “Your morals tend to become a bit more <i>flexible</i> about rule-following and rule-breaking when it gets you a check at the end of the day.”</p><p>She should respond with a flat-out no. <i>No, I will not sub for you, Agatha</i>. That’s all she needs to say. So why the <i>FUCK</i> doesn’t she? Rio must genuinely be losing her mind because her instinct is to not immediately say no - it’s to actually think about what it would be like.</p><p>What is going on with her? Why is she so willing to bend over backward to make Agatha happy and do as she asks, when <i>she</i> is the dominant in their relationship? She’s never felt like this before and it’s driving her crazy.</p><p>“I’ll think about it,” Rio finally says, after a long moment of deep thought. When a winning smile begins to appear on her sub’s face, she pinches Agatha’s lips together with one hand, forcing them closed. “That’s not a ‘yes’, Agatha. And before you pull out your snark, I’m aware that it’s not a ‘no’ either, but I do genuinely need time to consider it. I don’t <i>ever</i> sub casually, okay? If I did decide to sub for you I would need a solid justification for it beyond ‘showing you how to submit properly’.” When Agatha merely peers up at her with those mesmerizing blue eyes, Rio releases her lips, trailing her fingers down her throat to the neckline of her dress. “Don’t ask me again, alright, pretty girl?” she requests softly. “I don’t want you scheming behind my back to convince me to agree.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. “I would never do that.”</p><p>Rio snorts, her hand slithering further down until she can grasp the lawyer’s fabric-covered but erect nipple of her right breast between the pads of her fingers, rolling it between them teasingly. “Oh, I’m sure.”</p><p>She startles when Agatha grasps her wrist securely. When she glances down, expecting to see puppy dog eyes and a killer pout as the older woman prepares a major guilt-trip for thinking she would do that to her, she is instead met with a completely earnest expression.</p><p>“No, Rio, I’m - I’m serious, I would <i>never</i> try and manipulate you or pressurize you into subbing for me,” Agatha tells her solemnly. “I swear.”</p><p>Her heart swoops. Is that what happened with Agatha, she wonders. She’s a dominant-leading switch, but she subbed for her ex. Was she pressured into subbing for her? Did she not actually want to sub at all?</p><p>If that’s the case, then the fact she has hired Rio and does actually willingly submit to her - yes, after a rough and tumble and a <i>lot</i> of bark and bite - is significant. It shows that Agatha may be cynical, but there is still a tiny spark of optimism inside of her that encourages to her trust others and let them see her in a position where she is needy and vulnerable.</p><p>Rio caresses her thumb over Agatha’s cheek, assuring her gently, “I believe you.”</p><p>When Agatha appears to relax, the tension easing from her shoulders, the dom hums. She pulls Agatha’s hair out of its bun and runs her fingers through her sub’s messy dark mane, like she’s petting an animal. It makes the lawyer’s eyelids flutter closed, her mouth dropping open as she basks in the attention. That, paired with the vibrator buzzing inside of her, makes her start to grind in search of stimulation again. And oh, does Rio have plans on how to give it to her.</p><p>“I’m feeling magnanimous today, and you were a very good girl in being open to discussing our session and your limits.” Taking a step back, Rio slaps a hand down on Agatha’s exposed thigh, making her cry out. A bright red handprint is left behind, and Agatha stares up at her with eyes as round as plates and dilated pupils. “Turn around, hang over the back of the couch.”</p><p>“What? No, I’ll fall,” Agatha argues.</p><p>“Trust me not to let you.”</p><p>She chews on her lip, and for a moment, Rio is worried that Agatha is going to raise high hell, or try and assert dominance over her. But then her sub huffs, and rolls sideways so she can climb to her knees.</p><p>Watching on carefully, to make sure Agatha doesn’t fall, Rio sets her hands on Agatha’s hips and positions her exactly how she wants her, bent and balanced over the top of the couch. Her upper half hangs essentially unsupported, her feet planted and anchoring her to the furniture.</p><p>She could fall any second, and that’s part of the thrill of it. She has to trust Rio not to let her slip off and fall flat on her face, so it’s an exercise in faith just as much as stability. It’ll test their dynamic. It forces Agatha to rely on her.</p><p>Kneeling behind Agatha, Rio settles down so that her face is level with her ass and cunt. She uses her hands to help secure her sub in place, pressing her weight forward through her arms to pin Agatha’s thighs to the back cushions.</p><p>Leaning forward, she exhales heavily, breathing out a lungful of hot air over Agatha’s entrance to make her shiver. Bent over like this, Agatha’s core is fully exposed to her, labia slightly spread so she can see a sliver of the black vibe nestled within her.</p><p>“Are you going to eat me out?” Agatha asks, sounding winded from her position.</p><p>“With your vibrator inside of you, yes,” Rio murmurs, licking her lips. Fuck, she’s so thirsty, and not for water. “I’m gonna suck your clit until it's numb and you feel like it’s gonna fall off. I’m gonna get my whole tongue inside your <i>bizcochito</i>.” She applies pressure with her fingers on Agatha’s pale thighs. “Spread’em, if you please, milady.”</p><p>She obeys instantly, much to Rio’s surprise, although maybe she’s just desperate enough after an hour of sitting with a vibrator inside of her, and an extra twenty minutes of teasing, that she doesn’t care about putting up a fight.</p><p>“Good girl,” she praises. “Fuck, you’re soaked. All pink and puffy and flushed. It’s beautiful. Are you always gonna react like this to me, Agatha? Because I love it. I love that you get so wet for me, sweetheart.”</p><p>She traces her fingers around the plug in her sub’s ass, giving it a light tug, which makes Agatha cry out. Oh, it’s <i>snug</i> in her tight bottom. Pulling on it again, until the metal bulb of it begins to emerge, she watches in awe as Agatha’s ass swallows it up again as soon as she lets go, clenching around the metal hungrily.</p><p>“You’re staring,” Agatha rasps. “Are you gonna put your mouth to work or leave me hanging?”</p><p>“Can you blame me?” Rio fires back, and her voice is ragged. God, she’s so fucking turned on she’s certain that she’s soaked through her boxer briefs to form a wet patch on her cargo shorts. Her lower belly is <i>burning</i> with desire, so much so that it almost <i>hurts</i>. “You’re wearing a fucking princess plug in your ass and it’s <i>very</i> distracting.” “</p><p>Showing remarkable core strength, Agatha pushes herself upwards, tossing her hair over her shoulder to glance back at Rio with gleaming eyes. “Take a picture, it’ll last longer,” she quips.</p><p>Rio chuckles at first, but then sobers when she realizes that Agatha has quirked an eyebrow at her. “Are you serious?” she challenges, her heart jackrabbiting in her chest at the idea. Oh fuck that would be so insanely hot.</p><p>“Deadly,” Agatha groans, head falling back down limply as she dangles off the top of the couch, her arms slipping from beneath her. “I gave you permission yesterday to wank off over pictures of me, didn’t I? I’m not camera-shy by any means. I’d consider it a compliment, honestly.”</p><p>Oh god, she wants to. Rio so, <i>so</i> badly wants to take a photo to document this. She gives Agatha’s hips a firm tug backwards, until her chest is propped up on the couch’s back cushions and she’s at less of a risk of falling. And then, once her sub’s safety is assured, she scrambles off the couch to find Agatha’s phone. She <i>could</i> take the photo on her own, but she’s not sure whether Agatha is offering in the heat of the moment - if she takes it on Agatha’s own phone then she can choose later whether or not she actually wants Rio to have it.</p><p>When she returns to the couch, climbing back into her kneeling position, she slides her wet thumb against the screen, asking, “What’s your passcode?”</p><p>“You’re gonna have to guess it,” Agatha laughs.</p><p>Well, this is the woman who uses Safari suggested passwords on her laptop, so it’s going to be something stupidly easy to remember. And knowing Agatha… also something playful and lewd. Rio taps on the screen. <i>6 9 6 9</i>. Unlocked.</p><p>She bursts out laughing, quickly finding the camera app and opening it up. “You really need to get better at picking passwords.”</p><p>She frames Agatha’s soaking wet, swollen pussy and her gem-adorned plugged ass in the center of the frame, making sure that her position hanging over the top of the couch is visible, but her face is not. She arranges the hemline of Agatha’s dress so that it’s clear that she wasn’t wearing underwear before, and then pushes it up so it bunches around her waist, crumpled and probably ruined.</p><p>Rio can’t help but take a couple of shots, all varying levels of zoomed-in, and she hurries to take a couple more when a glistening bead of cum trickles down Agatha’s leg from her weeping cunt.</p><p>She bends down to lick it up, growling when Agatha cries out and trembles in response, trying to kick her legs back but failing because of how Rio pins them in place. She tastes just as sweet as before, and Rio laps at the wetness around her upper thighs before pulling back.</p><p>“You can decide whether or not you want to send those to me later,” the dom tells her hoarsely. She glances down at the phone, thumbing through the different pages of apps. “What’s the app called for controlling your vibrator?”</p><p>“S’called Joyride, should be on the third page with a red logo,” Agatha pants.</p><p>Rio finds it easily. The app displays a strong bluetooth connection to the vibe inside of Agatha, and as she said, is currently set on a cycle; it’s in the low-vibration phase. Overcome with greediness, Rio doesn’t hesitate to raise the vibration level to the highest, watching on in admiration as Agatha’s pussy immediately goes into spasms, her aching red clit throbbing as she chokes on a muted scream.</p><p>“Fuck fuck <i>fuck fuck</i>,” Agatha explodes, her hips frantically thrusting downwards. “Are you trying to kill me!?”</p><p>“Oh, does it hurt?” Rio says mockingly. She pushes Agatha’s torso forward until she’s back in her precarious position from before, drooping off the top of the couch. “Did somebody get themselves all worked up and sensitive after secretly teasing herself all morning? Poor pretty girl, you’re just so desperate, aren’t you?”</p><p>“If I didn’t know - falling would give me - a fucking <i>concussion</i> - I would turn around and - <i>SLAP YOU</i>,” Agatha growls, between keening whimpers.</p><p>“If it’s too much, I can turn it off,” Rio says innocently, waving Agatha’s phone up and down.</p><p>“<i>Don’t you fucking dare</i>,” the sub chokes out. “I’m greener than a fucking <i>Christmas tree</i>.”</p><p>The warmth bubbling away in Rio’s abdomen expands, until she can feel it throughout her whole body, making the dom inside of her purr like a content big cat. “Good. You come as many times as you want. As many times as you <i>can</i>. Is that clear?”</p><p>“<i>YES.</i>”</p><p>“Yes, <i>what?</i>” Rio provokes her.</p><p>“Yes, sir!” Agatha cries out. <i>Sir.</i> The dom shudders. Oh, Rio could get used to hearing that. “Eat me out!”</p><p>“What’s the magic word?” Agatha doesn’t respond beyond a pained grunt, so Rio tuts, “Don’t forget your manners now.”</p><p>She witnesses the moment that her sub is pushed over the edge, all of the waiting and teasing finally shattering her resolve, because she hears the sob in Agatha’s voice as she bursts out, “Please, <i>please</i>, sir, <i>please</i> eat my pussy, lick my clit, <i>PLEASE</i>, I’ll be a good girl for you!”</p><p>With that enthusiastic verbal consent, Rio tosses the phone aside and goes to town. She starts with little kitten licks all over Agatha’s folds, grazing over her entrance.  Her nose bumps against the plug in her ass, so she shifts upwards and licks around that as well, the metal cold against the tip of her tongue.</p><p>“So succulent,” she mumbles into Agatha’s pussy, moaning at her flavor. “Fucking five-course meal, <i>bizcochito</i>, I could eat you out every day and never get tired of the way you taste.”</p><p>She then focuses attention on Agatha’s clit, using the entire length of her broad tongue to lap over the throbbing little muscle until Agatha is shaking from overstimulation. Her nose actually ends up dipping inside of her entrance, brushing up against the vibrator waging war on her sub’s nerves. And when she thrusts her tongue inside of her, rubbing it around her walls, Agatha goes beserk, her hips jumping frantically and nearly sending her flying off the couch and crashing down onto the floor.</p><p>Agatha comes twice; once with Rio’s tongue buried inside of her, and then again in quick succession as the dom is very slowly, teasingly, torturously, pulling the vibrator out of her, alongside pulling out her princess plug, to stretch both her holes simultaneously. The vibrator is long and thin, only perhaps the width of two fingers, but its length means it probably made her feel very full. The plug, in comparison, is shorter but much fatter; Rio can’t even close her forefinger and thumb around it at its widest point.</p><p>Her sub dissolves into spasms the second that the butt plug is removed from her ass, which is left gaping and soaked with lube and juices. The sound that rips from her throat is primal, more like a wolf’s coarse howl than a human noise. Cum squirts out of her pussy into Rio’s eagerly receptive mouth, and she licks up all of the sweet juices as if she’s utterly parched, and this is the first drink she’s had in days.</p><p>“One more,” Rio says in a low, rumbling voice, wiping the plug clean with a wet wipe she quickly sources from her backpack on the ground beneath the coffee table. She spits a wod of saliva into Agatha’s gaping asshole, prepping her for what Rio knows will be her final orgasm. “Can my pretty girl give me one more?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha shakes her head, lying completely boneless, her arms dragging on the floor. She’s not even trying to hold herself up anymore. “No more.”</p><p>“Magic word.”</p><p>Agatha grits her teeth and forces out, “<i>PLEASE.</i>”</p><p>“‘Please’?” Rio echoes, derisively copying Agatha’s whiny, needy tone. “‘Please’, give me one more, is that what you mean, baby?”</p><p>“You know that’s not what I mean!” Agatha yowls.</p><p>“Is there a particular word that you want to say, to tap out? Begins with safe? Do you need to say it, sweetheart? Is it all getting too much for you, my precious puppy?”</p><p>“<i>FUCK YOU.</i>”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio says simply.</p><p>She slips the cleaned butt plug into Agatha’s pussy, the near fist-like size of it spreading her lips so much they turn white. And then slides the vibrator, on full power, directly into her ass.</p><p>Agatha comes instantly with a strangled shriek, transforming into a flailing, seizing mess. And Rio, who has been frigging herself beneath her cargo pants with her free hand, comes as well, her clit throbbing wildly and cunt feeling achingly empty as her muscles contract, desperately clutching at nothing.</p><p>Far more occupied with Agatha’s pleasure than her own, Rio draws her sub’s orgasm out by fucking her with the plug in her cunt, using her free hand to gradually lower the input of the vibrator through the app on Agatha’s phone.</p><p>Once they have both calmed down, orgasms tapering off as their minds swim in pleasure neurotransmitters, Rio very gently withdraws the plug and vibrator from inside her sub, setting them aside on a wet wipe to be sanitized later.</p><p>She tentatively pulls Agatha into her lap, helping her lie down curled up on the couch with her head pillowed on the dom’s thighs. Agatha’s face is turned in towards her stomach, so that Rio can comb her fingers through her sweaty hair. She’s still trembling, and flushed all over with her chest heaving, but she has a dreamy, blissful expression on her face.</p><p>“Good?” Rio checks.</p><p>“Hmm,” is all Agatha replies, her eyes closed, but there’s a tiny euphoric smile on her face that better answers that question. “You look like you’ve just devoured a watermelon.”</p><p>Rio laughs. Her face is astonishingly wet, but that’s because Agatha’s cunt was drenched. Her cum is still dripping down her chin. “Because someone just squirted all over my face like a water fountain.” She jerks when she feels Agatha’s shaking hands start trying to undo the fastenings of her cargo pants. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“Gotta make you cum,” Agatha mumbles.</p><p>“No need, <i>bizcochito</i>,” she chuckles, stroking her fingertips over her sub’s forehead. “Seeing you fall to pieces with that vibrator in your ass had me coming in my pants like a teenager. Hot as fuck.”</p><p>Agatha pouts. “One day you’ll let <i>me</i> make you cum,” she mutters.</p><p>Rio’s not sure why, but hearing Agatha say that makes her belly tighten, but with anxiety, not arousal. “If that’s what you want, darling.”</p><p>“I don’t just want to make you cum, I want -” Agatha cuts herself off, blanching. She looks panicked, for a fleeting second, and then swallows, lowering her gaze with a watery smile. “Never mind.”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio says, frowning. “Hey, what was that look?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha replies. “Don’t worry. Just got lost in my head for a second.” She glances up again to ask quietly, “Water, please?”</p><p>She leaves Agatha to recover her strength on the couch to duck into the kitchen to grab her a glass of water, and some dark chocolate with almonds that she finds in the fridge. She nearly has a heart attack when she returns to the living room to find that Agatha has absconded, but then hears the toilet flush from the hallway, and realises that she’s gone to make herself presentable.</p><p>When Agatha reappears, her dress is back in place, looking a little wrinkled but not massively so, and her hair is combed back into a somewhat neat bun. Her face remains flushed, but it’s less obvious that she was just fucked within an inch of her life on her own couch.</p><p>Rio offers her the water and the chocolate with a soft smile, but her grin swiftly disappears when Agatha regards her with a cool, aloof expression. There’s <i>no</i> hint of affection in her frigid gaze, and Rio feels like she’s just been thrown into a pool of ice water, the spark in her heart snuffed out.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I forgot - I have a Teams meeting with my paralegal in ten minutes,” Agatha says flatly. “I’ll text you next week when I’m in the state, and let you know my availability for our second session.” She pauses and then corrects, “Second <i>official</i> session, that is.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio says lamely. She hates how awkward she feels, like the rug has been yanked out from beneath her, because her aftercare routine has been interrupted. “Um - are you still gonna let me do aftercare, because -”</p><p>“Thank you for the sex,” Agatha says, before she can say anymore, as easily and bluntly as one would say thank you for holding the door open for them. But her expression contradicts her tone her voice. She looks as if she’s in pain, as if she’s <i>hurting</i>. As if she’s disappointed and angry and upset. “I hope you think the debrief went well. You can see yourself out?”</p><p>She disappears up the stairs, leaving Rio standing in the living room, frozen and gaping at her. Rio watches Agatha leave in sheer disbelief. She’s just… walking off. Leaving Rio alone. After sex that Agatha specifically asked for, specifically asked Rio to <i>break her own damn rules</i> for. Yes, Rio consented to it, but she didn’t imagine that Agatha would just - drop her like a toy she’s become disinterested in as soon as it was over.</p><p>What is happening. What is going on. She is <i>so confused</i>.</p><p>But knowing she has been dismissed - <i>very abruptly and rudely</i> - Rio gathers her belongings, checking her backpack. Her gaze keeps straying over to the coffee table, where the vibrator and the butt plug still rest on a wet wipe, and over to the couch, where there are huge wet stains on the bottom and back cushions.</p><p>“<i>Mreow</i>,” she hears from the stairway. She turns to see Scratchy sitting there, his tail twitching as he stares at her with amber eyes. He flicks an ear, and licks at a paw stoically. The way he’s looking at her is questioning. What question he is silently asking, she has no clue.</p><p>“I don’t know,” she responds hopelessly. “Your mom’s a fucking enigma.”</p><p>She departs the house in a daze. She feels sick to her stomach, and completely exhausted. So tired that she drags her feet as she clambers into her car, feeling the beginnings of a headache approaching. Her hands are shaking.</p><p>Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. Is she experiencing topdrop? She hasn’t suffered from topdrop in <i>years</i>. It’s been so long that she’s forgotten what it feels like for her, and now she’s panicking because she doesn’t know what’s going on with her body.</p><p>Sitting in the driver’s seat, Rio engages in controlled breathing, trying to calm herself down.</p><p>Okay, yes, it <i>sucked</i> that their session ended like that today, and it <i>especially</i> sucked that Agatha was so dismissive. But Agatha seemed to have some sort of intrusive thought before she vanished into the bathroom for those <i>minutes</i> she was out of Rio’s sight.</p><p>Something must have spooked her. There’s no other reason why she would 180 so suddenly. And Agatha sounded emotionless, yes, but she also looked -</p><p>
<i>Sad.</i>
</p><p>Rio folds at the waist and rests her forehead against the steering wheel of her Mini, groaning.</p><p>Oh god.</p><p>What the fuck just happened? And what went wrong?</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Top drop fucking sucks.</p><p>It combines both the most intense sensation of being burnt out with the crippling anxiety and guilt of feeling like she has done something wrong. And Rio hates it. She feels so bone-tired and lethargic, the day after her and Agatha’s impromptu not-session, that she’s forced to cancel two upcoming sessions with clients later on in the week, claiming sickness. A consultancy session is postponed as well, as Rio knows she’s entirely off her game and will not be able to slip into her dom persona when she is feeling so low.</p><p>Being a chronic overthinker, it’s only inevitable that Rio ends up spiraling. Insomnia creeps in as she lies in bed that night, staring up at the ceiling in the pitch black, unable to sleep. And she is bombarded by her thoughts.</p><p>Why did Agatha’s behavior change so abruptly after they had sex? Why did she panic mid-sentence and silence herself from telling Rio what she wanted? Why did she not allow her dom to perform aftercare? Why did she basically kick Rio out of her house, and why did she seem so sad to be doing so?</p><p>She has her suspicions. Curled up alone in bed, with her mind on overdrive, she speculates for hours. Maybe Rio messed up somewhere and reminded Agatha of her abusive ex. Maybe she upset the lawyer by not allowing her to make her come - although surely Agatha would have been flattered by Rio orgasming essentially untouched by watching her climax.</p><p>Maybe Agatha, like Rio, is starting to become all too aware that she is not as objective about their professional relationship as she should be, and is beginning to get invested in it - and panicked because she realized that she is beginning to <i>care</i>.</p><p>(Maybe that’s Rio’s wishful thinking, hoping that Agatha recognizes the growing bond between them, which is stronger than just their dominatrix-client relationship, which is stronger than mere friendship.)</p><p>Regardless of what role Rio may have played in Agatha’s sudden switch-up in emotional state on Monday, and how responsible she may be for it… a small part of her is angry at Agatha. She doesn’t want to be, and the dom in her is more concerned about her sub than anything, but she can’t help it. She explained to Agatha before how important aftercare is for her after sessions, and Agatha kicked her to the curb without any consideration for what <i>Rio</i> needed after sex in that moment.</p><p>Perhaps Agatha didn’t think that aftercare was necessary - not just because she doesn’t seem to believe in the importance of aftercare, but because they established that it was not a scene between them. That would be… <i>somewhat</i> understandable, but after Rio asked her <i>out</i> loud if Agatha was going to allow her aftercare, that should have clued the lawyer in.</p><p>She’s mad. She’s also disappointed. And there’s nothing she despises more than feeling disappointed with a sub, because it is a genuinely painful experience for her. Honestly, if it were any of her other clients, Rio would end the relationship between them, without a thought.</p><p>Top drop is extremely serious, and it always hits Rio particularly hard. Hell, she’s had to turn down client opportunities and sessions this week that would have usually netted her fifteen grand. Her body is a tool, and if it’s not cooperating with her endorphin and adrenaline-addled brain properly, then she can’t work.</p><p>Agatha may not have intended to trigger her to drop, but she did, nonetheless. Considering that Agatha doesn’t even think that subspace is real, however… maybe she doesn’t think that sub drop and top drop are real either. In which case… is it not Rio’s responsibility, as her dom, to educate her?</p><p>No, probably not - but she <i>wants</i> to educate her. That’s the whole reason why she gave her the self-written dummies’ guide to submission to study before their next session, and why she plans on giving her a multiple-choice pop quiz to see if Agatha has actually put any effort into reading the folder.</p><p>Considering impact play is on the roster for their next scene, however, she will have the perfect opportunity to discipline Agatha and dole out a punishment for preventing Rio from performing aftercare. She will absolutely have to re-think how the punishment will work, however, since she knows that Agatha has a giant pain kink, and that being struck turns her on. Agatha won’t learn anything if she’s too busy getting off on being spanked or paddled.</p><p>Rio throws herself into writing a meticulous scene plan for her next session with Agatha, hoping that it will help settle her tumultuous emotional state so she recovers from top drop faster. She brings her notebook with her to coffee shops and on long winding walks through the nearest nature park, forcing herself to get out of her apartment and bask in fresh air and sunlight.</p><p>Agatha never leaves her mind.</p><p>She begins to wonder if there is any world where Agatha Harkness <i>doesn’t</i> consume her every waking (and dreaming) thought.</p><p>By Friday, Rio feels mostly recuperated, although not prepared to deal with any other clients that weekend. Fortunately, she only really has one other regular weekend client she deals with, and she also happens to be out of state, on vacation, so she doesn’t have to cancel any other sessions and lose more income.</p><p>Which is honestly a relief, because it’s kind of terrible of her, but she literally cannot think about <i>anybody</i> but Agatha. Rio tries to write up plans for her other clients’ sessions and ends up coming up with ideas for Agatha’s instead. It’s awful. Next, she’ll end up thinking of Agatha in the middle of sex with another woman.</p><p>Rio becomes aware, as she’s sipping on coffee that morning and flicking absentmindedly through apps on her phone, that Agatha has actually traveled to California for some fancy legal conference and award ceremony. The dominatrix is alerted to this by her social media feeds, because her algorithms have been altered by her searching for pictures of Agatha on Twitter and Instagram at the weekend; they now think she is one of the obsessed horny lesbians who fangirl over the lawyer and have a mental breakdown over every single hot photo.</p><p>(And really… are the algorithms incorrect?)</p><p>Seeing the photos posted of Agatha at the conference has her <i>sprinting</i> for the shower and turning the dial so the water runs ice cold. Agatha Harkness wearing a slim-fitting three-piece burgundy suit is too much for Rio’s ovaries to handle.</p><p>Then there are more photos of her on different days of the conference: Agatha in a blood red midi dress with a ruffled skirt, Agatha dressed in a midnight blue suit, Agatha dressed in a green velvet gown with the most outrageous plunging neckline that Rio has <i>ever fucking seen</i>, that makes her start to salivate.</p><p>If Rio spends a single extra minute thinking about her client’s tousled hickory hair spilling over her bare shoulders, her piercing stormy blue eyes flecked with sage and hazel, and her strong veiny hands and long dextrous fingers… she might spontaneously combust.</p><p>And she does.</p><p>She stands under the freezing water until she’s shivering, keeping her hands planted firmly on the wall… until she can no longer resist the urge to slip them between her thighs and stroke her throbbing clit.</p><p>“Agatha,” she breathes, her eyes closed. “Oh, <i>fuck</i>, yeah. <i>Agatha</i>.”</p><p>All it takes is her imagining herself lying naked on her belly on one of those generic conference tables covered in scratchy blue fabric, with Agatha standing over her, dressed in that burgundy three-piece suit with her blazer slung over her shoulder. The image of the sharp-eyed lawyer, her strap poking out from the unzipped fly of her pants, feeding her cock into Rio and murmuring mockingly <i>poor baby’s so desperate for my come inside of her</i>, is enough to make her orgasm explosively.</p><p>Despite her body being close to hypothermic, Rio’s fantasy quite literally <i>shoves</i> her over the edge, turning her into an overwhelmed, quivering mess. And by literally, she means that her feet slip out from beneath her because of the conditioner that’s fallen on the shower floor. Rio nearly ends up giving herself a concussion.</p><p>Sitting in a haphazard pile of limbs on her shower floor, cold water beating down on her above, Rio squeezes her eyes shut and groans. God, she’s fucking <i>pitiful</i>. If Agatha knew that she was getting herself off to fantasies of her, she would undoubtedly howl with laughter. It is <i>not normal</i> for her to be thinking about her client this much, and Rio is starting to feel like a pervert.</p><p>She refuses to call it <i>pining</i>. It’s lusting, she insists to herself. And it’s entirely possible that it will pass. Agatha is somebody new and fascinating in her life, and she’s the greatest challenge of a client Rio has ever handled, so of course she will constantly be at the forefront of Rio’s mind.</p><p>She just needs to… get it out of her system. That’s it. Rio cares about Agatha, yes, and perhaps more than she should, but she’s just <i>invested</i>. The connection she feels between them, the attraction that grows with every passing second, those feelings will probably fade. Right?</p><p>Later that Friday, in the early afternoon, Rio drags herself to Whole Foods to find some ingredients for a couple of recipes she wants to try out over the weekend, her phone burning in her jeans pocket. She’s wearing her ‘Lesbianism Finds A Way’ Jurassic Park t-shirt with the T-Rex in the lesbian flag colors; it always makes her laugh, because the number of arguments she has gotten into by explaining to irate homophobes that all the dinosaurs were technically lesbians is hilarious.</p><p>Rio taps the toe of her Blundstones on the tile flooring in annoyance as she pulls bottles of olive oil off the shelves to examine their ingredients and origin labels. Damn, since when is olive oil so expensive, and since when have the shelves been filled with such obvious fake crap? Sighing, Rio ends up picking what looks to be one of the more expensive extra virgin bottles that boasts about being single-origin and first-press.</p><p>It’s as she’s grasping the bottle by its neck and heading back to where she abandoned her cart that she hears her phone chirp. She freezes instantly upon hearing the Law and Order Special Victims Unit sound effect. Agatha.</p><p>Swapping the bottle of olive oil to her non-dominant hand, Rio reaches into her back pocket to hastily fish out her phone. There is no preview for the text Agatha has sent, strangely, so Rio has to unlock and then open her messages app to view it.</p><p>She is immediately met with the photos she took of Agatha on Monday. The lawyer’s trembling legs are spread wide with her rumbled dress bunched up around her waist. Her oozing, puffy pink pussy is in center frame; a gleaming bead of come trails down to the shiny amethyst princess plug in her ass.</p><p>Rio practically goes cross-eyed and blacks out. It’s as if a bonfire doused in gasoline has been suddenly set alight in her lower belly, and the swiftness that it goes up in flames and <i>floods</i> her body with heat makes her knees wobble. Her mouth dries out and feels like it’s been filled with sand, and she nearly chokes as a result. Her brain full-on error-404’s and as a result, she drops the bottle of olive oil - which shatters on the floor and sends the slippery yellow liquid flying everywhere.</p><p>“Oh fuck,” she blurts out, and then, in her shock, drops her phone into the puddle of olive oil. “Oh <i>fuck</i>.”</p><p>Standing there stunned, like a statue, Rio stares at the absolute disaster that has befallen her, olive oil seeping into her shoes, her phone lying screen down in said olive oil, and shards of dark green glass littering the ground around her.</p><p>“Ma’am?” Rio’s head snaps up in a panic. She sees an older man, wearing a black Whole Foods apron, staring at her from the end of their aisle, with black bags under his eyes and a mightily unimpressed look on his face. “You’re going to have to pay for that.”</p><p>“Yeah, of course, I’m so sorry,” she stammers. “Just - I’m sorry.”</p><p>She awkwardly stands there as two more Whole Foods workers arrive to start cleaning up the olive oil spill surrounding her, having been asked by a young tired-looking woman to stay still so that she doesn’t track oil around the store. That woman assures her quietly under her breath that she does <i>not</i> have to pay for the broken bottle, and they cannot legally make her, so not to worry about it.</p><p>The older man, who is glaring at Rio as if she is the scum of the earth for the accident, reaches down and picks up her phone for her. Rio watches in slow motion, swamped by dread , and prays to whatever god may be listening that her phone has switched off or has been ruined by the oil.</p><p>Alas, she is not that lucky. She has been cursed to a life of humiliation. The Whole Foods worker catches a glimpse of the screen, which is still on and, to her horror, showing Agatha’s nudes. The man promptly turns crimson, looking astonished, and then outraged.</p><p>“Ma’am! This is a <i>Whole Foods</i>, it’s extremely inappropriate to be viewing <i>pornography</i> while shopping on our premises!” he barks at her, thrusting the oil-soaked phone into her hands in disgust.</p><p>He shouts the word <i>pornography</i> so loudly that the entire store must be able to hear, because it quickly becomes eerily quiet. Rio stares at him with eyes as round of plates, speechless and mortified. What the hell is she meant to say to that? The other two workers who have been sweeping up the glass and soaking the oil up with special absorbent pads grind to a halt to blink at her in disbelief, the woman mouthing silently, ‘<i>porn?</i>’ with an incredulous expression.</p><p>She feels like a cornered animal, with people circling her wielding spears. But Rio refuses to go down without a fight. If there is one thing she knows how to do… it’s roll with the fucking punches. As her adrenaline kicks in, her heart pounding in her chest, she places a hand over her heart and plasters on an affronted, tearful expression.</p><p>“Excuse <i>me</i>, sir, that’s my <i>wife</i>, and she’s been away overseas for <i>months!</i>” she says, in a high-pitched, shrill voice. The man’s eyes widen and he takes an unsteady step back. “Forgive me for engaging in some harmless naughty texting at the only time of the day she’s available to talk to me, to help keep our love alive and strong!” she continues to wail, raising her voice until the man is frantically gesturing at her to quieten down, now looking incredibly panicked. “And how <i>dare</i> you invade our privacy by peeking at images of my wife on my phone! That’s perverted behavior, sir!” Rio shouts gleefully.</p><p>“My apologies, ma’am,” the Whole Foods worker stutters, backing away. “I’m - so sorry. I didn’t mean any offense.”</p><p>He scurries away, his face now red with embarrassment, rather than anger. Rio rocks back on her heels in triumph. She will never, <i>ever</i> tell Agatha that she called her her wife, and it was probably wrong of her to do so, but damn, if it wasn’t satisfying seeing that guy shrink in front of her and tuck his tail between his legs. The woman worker, with a faint blush to her cheeks, offers her a couple of wet wipes to clean her phone and also wipe off the bottoms of her shoes.</p><p>“Your wife is a very lucky woman,” the woman murmurs, and Rio beams and winks at her.</p><p>She flees the Whole Foods quickly after that, shoving twenty dollar bills into the hands of the two workers who she abandons mopping the floor with grease-busting cleaning detergent. Rio sees the older man in the apron marching across the store with another employee, who is likely the manager, both of them looking flustered.</p><p>The manager is on their phone, and she overhears them saying the word ‘security’, shortly before the word ‘police’. Rio decides that it’s not worth the hassle to stay and pay for her groceries if they’re calling the fucking cops on her, and books it out of there. She can always go to a Walmart tomorrow.</p><p>She hurries over to her Mini in the parking lot, and once she’s seated in the driver’s seat, she peers down at her phone screen, which is still open on her messages with Agatha. Her abdomen tightens and she presses her thighs together as she once again is punched in the face with a photo of Agatha’s weeping cunt, the one showing off her retracted clitoral hood and her glistening swollen clit beneath it.</p><p>Rio is about to commit the greatest of all sins, which to her happens to be fingering herself to completion in a Whole Foods parking lot, when another message comes through - this time an actual text from Agatha.</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>Enjoying the photos? *peach emoji*</i>
</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, running a hand over her face.</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>I was in the middle of grocery shopping, you just about gave me a heart attack. Thank you for sending them, but I think I’m gonna be banned from this Whole Foods because of you. I could have been ARRESTED. MENACE.</i>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>Excellent, you’re welcome ;) I’m flying back early. Can we meet Thurs?</i>
</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows raise up to her hairline. Early, huh? She exits the app to Google the conference that Agatha is at, checking the dates. It ends next Thursday. Agatha was likely staying a couple of extra days in California to avoid getting on any of the busier flights back across the country. If she’s moving her flight to an earlier day, then she must be impatient to get back to New York.</p><p>She checks her calendar for good measure, even though she already knows that she would clear it because she is unfathomably thrilled about seeing Agatha again, if only so she can carry out her scene plan and get the lawyer over her lap for the first time.</p><p>Maybe she’s a little too excited about getting a chance to punish her using impact play. There’s a tiny vindictive voice at the back of her mind that she hates, telling her that Agatha deserves to be walloped for inadvertently triggering Rio to top drop, even though the logical side of her knows that Agatha did not do that intentionally.</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>Thurs after 5 is good for me. I’ll get you on the books. When do you fly in?</i>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>Thurs morn.</i>
</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>Somebody is super eager to get the shit railed out of her :P</i>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>I’ve spent the last week surrounded by idiotic obnoxious straight men who are hung like teacup Yorkshire terriers and overcompensate for it by yapping incessantly and acting like they’d be doing me a favor by sleeping with me.</i><br/>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>I am literally wearing a lesbian pride flag pin on my lanyard.</i>
</p><p>Rio snorts a laugh, even as she grimaces and feels uncomfortably and oddly annoyed by the prospect of people flirting with Agatha. It’s not even that it’s small-dicked men flirting with her, who have no chance since Agatha bats for the opposite team. It’s just the entire idea of Agatha being pursued romantically, and she knows that she <i>shouldn’t</i> be irritated by it.</p><p>Their relationship may have progressed from professional dominatrix and client to very morally dubious friends-with-benefits, but she and Agatha aren’t dating. Hell, she agreed to take on the role of Agatha’s dom to help her improve her submission when she does end up searching for a new romantic partner and dom one day. She has absolutely no claim to Agatha whatsoever. Her heart, however, objects to the idea of anybody else other than her placing their hands on the lawyer.</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>Yikes.</i>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>Yikes indeed so I am ‘super eager’ as you put it to get some stress relief.</i>
</p><p>Stress relief, huh? Rio smirks to herself, leaning back and pulling one leg up, resting her shin against the steering wheel. If being fucked within an inch of her life is how Agatha enjoys relieving stress, then who is she to judge, when she is the one being invited to do said fucking?</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>Are you working Fri?</i>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>No. Why??? I can do Fri as well.</i>
</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>You won’t be able to sit down properly the day after, just making sure you haven’t booked a day full of meetings where you’d be squirming around in your chair like a little kid holding in pee. Sending scene plan now.</i>
</p><p>She finds the scene plan in her notes, where it has sat completed for a couple of days now. Reading it over once last time - and biting her lip as she does so, her core clenching - she texts it over to Agatha as an attachment.</p><p>When her client doesn’t respond immediately, Rio realizes that Agatha will likely be going through the plan with a fine-toothed comb like she did last time to ply her with a pile of notes and amendments. Putting her car into drive, Rio backs out of her parking space, nearly hitting two cars in the process (she hates bay parking, but at least it’s better than parallel) and heads home.</p><p>The scene plan is much shorter than the one she wrote before, not in length, as the session will likely take up an entire evening, but shorter in detail. She would never dare send such a vague plan over to any other client, but this is what they agreed that Agatha needs. Rio needs to keep her on her toes, and that means being spontaneous and unpredictable.</p><p>She does, of course, have a much more comprehensive idea of how she wants their scene to play out in her head, but she will not be writing it down and informing Agatha of her intentions. Rio’s goal for this second session is to be proactive and anticipatory, spotting the pitfalls that Agatha sets out before she has a chance to step into them, so she can outmaneuver her sub and gain the upper hand from the start.</p><p>She wants nothing more than to see Agatha outwitted, and most of all, <i>humbled</i>. She wants to put Agatha in her place. That’s partially because of how Rio has suffered from top drop this past week because of her, but she is going to try her very best to be objective in their session; she cannot let her frustration get the better of her.</p><p>If Rio can circumvent her sub’s bratty attitude early on, then perhaps Agatha will realize that there is no point continuing to fight her, and submit. Wishful thinking, yes, but part of her is convinced that outsmarting Agatha will impress her, and therefore win her respect and submission.</p><p>When she arrives home, Rio spends the afternoon tending to her plants, watering and trimming them as required, while a National Geographic documentary on the endangered vaquita porpoise plays on her laptop for background noise.</p><p>She gets no response from Agatha throughout the afternoon and early evening. She does, however, get a notification from her bank that Agatha has sent her the five thousand dollars to pay for the next session early. Rio ends up nearly driving herself insane glancing at her phone every ten minutes to see if she’s received a text from the lawyer. Nothing. For hours. She would have <i>at least</i> expected a text acknowledging that she is reading over the scene plan, but Agatha does not reply.</p><p>Finally, Rio becomes impatient and frustrated enough that she finds the legal conference’s website. She sees that there is an all-day benefit supporting the Innocence Project, and realizes that Agatha is likely not texting her with feedback on the scene plan because she’s busy networking. Sheepishly, Rio places her phone on charge on her kitchen counter, face down, so she is no longer tempted to continue obsessively checking it.</p><p>Curling up on her couch, Rio settles in for the night with a pepperoni and hot honey pizza she shoves in the oven. She pulls out one of her long abandoned crochet projects and puts on a new true crime series she’s had her eye on for a while, about the development of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit and serial killer profiling techniques. Something intense and exciting, in an attempt to distract herself and stop her mind from wandering towards thinking about Agatha.</p><p>Before long, it’s nearly midnight, and Rio is exhausted, struggling to stay awake. She kicks herself when she remembers that she is still technically recovering from top drop, and so is easily fatigued. After performing her bedtime routine, brushing her teeth and switching all her electronics off, Rio tiredly strips down to a white vest top and a pair of boxer briefs decorated with Bulbasaurs. Grabbing her phone from the counter, now fully charged, she has just turned off her lights and is just about to clamber into bed when -</p><p>Law and Order SVU text tone.</p><p>Rio stills. Hesitates. Swipes on her phone screen, the light of it <i>glaring</i> in the darkness of her bedroom, and opens Messages.</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>are you mad at me???</i>
</p><p>Rio blinks. Yanking back her quilt, she sinks down onto her mattress on her front and draws it back over her. Propping her chin on her pillow, Rio reads over the text again, her brain whirring as she tries to analyze those five words combined with three question marks.</p><p>She then pulls back up the scene plan, scanning over it; she worriedly wonders if somehow, she failed to be objective when writing it, and allowed her exasperation in regards to her triggered top drop to influence her writing. She may be mad, but she doesn’t want Agatha spiraling and growing overly anxious over it. Spotting nothing that glaringly indicates Rio’s disappointment, however, she flicks back over to the messages app.</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>?</i>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>your mad at me arent you</i>
</p><p>The lack of grammar and capitalization, and incorrect spellings, are highly concerning.</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>Can I call you?</i>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>no im texting under the table at this stupdi benefit thinggg.</i>
</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>Are you drunk?</i>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>noo ive only had like 1</i>
</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>One drink? Lightweight.</i>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>bottle of wine. some kind of super dry zinfandel ud hate it</i>
</p><p>Oh Jesus Christ. Rio drops her phone on the mattress for a moment to rub her hands over her face with a muffled groan. Agatha is across the other side of the country, clearly drunk out of her mind, and it’s making her act fretful and paranoid. An entire bottle of wine? And a Zinfanfel, which has a higher than typical alcohol content than the majority of wines? Does Agatha not have any of her lawyer colleagues at the benefit with her, to prevent her from drinking herself into a stupor?</p><p>She suddenly feels incredibly worried about her sub, her chest tightening and her heart aching.</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>Don’t drink anymore. I think you’ve had enough for the night.</i>
</p><p>Pausing, she then texts a couple of seconds later:</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>Why do you think I’m mad at you?</i>
</p><p>It takes a minute or two for Agatha to respond to that text, probably because she’s fumbling with her phone and struggling to type with drunken butterfingers.</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>cus i read the scene plan and ur punishing me in the scene for whatever i did but i dont know what i did wrong. im sorry if i did something to upsettt u when we fukced on monday, i dont know what i did to make you angry with me but you can hit me in the sessiooon and take ur anger out on me then if ud like. Im ok with the plan no changes needed and if ur gonna be mad and punhsi me then its ok if you wanto beat me. but if ur mad cna u please tell me why?</i>
</p><p>Shock crashes over like an icy tidal wave. Rio finds herself gasping in horror at what Agatha’s text implies. Agatha was so insistent during their conversation on Monday that her ex didn’t abuse her… and yet here she is, admitting that her ex would become furious enough to strike her in a fit of rage in the middle of their BDSM scenes. Telling Rio that can do the same. Because it’s what Agatha expects her to do. Because physical and emotional abuse has become normalized for her.</p><p>It’s fucking heartbreaking.</p><p>Tears spring to her eyes and she sniffs, rolling onto her back and clutching her phone to her chest. Rio hates that Agatha has been so badly hurt in the past by her doms that it has damaged the way she views BDSM dynamics, and given her a terrible impression of submission. She despises that it means Agatha is constantly on the alert with Rio, perturbed and haunted by the idea that Rio may turn on her and hurt her too, even though she is trying her very hardest to prove that she is trustworthy and caring and kind.</p><p>It’s not as if she can even blame Agatha for her wariness, or claim it’s irrational. And now… Rio feels like an utter asshole for even being angry with Agatha in the first place for pushing her away.</p><p>Agatha rejects aftercare because has been told repeatedly in the past that she doesn’t deserve it. She rejects her doms because experience has taught her that they treat her with cruelty and react badly to her establishing boundaries. Agatha panicked on Monday, and Rio now understands completely why she kicked her out. Yes, it was awful that her actions resulted in Rio top dropping, but she would be willing to experience all the top drop in the world if it meant that Agatha would finally feel safe.</p><p>She is not going to subject Agatha to a <i>beating</i> to punish her. She wrote in the scene plan that she will spank her, and may or may not use the paddle depending on her infractions. But God, no matter how angry she may be, or how much Agatha deserves to be disciplined, Rio would never fucking <i>beat</i> her.</p><p>Taking several deep breaths to pacify herself, Rio lifts her phone up and begins writing several long messages that she knows Agatha will not be able to fully comprehend in the drunk state she is, but she hopes her sub will return to in the morning to read after she has sobered up.</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>It’s inappropriate for us to have this conversation over text, especially if you’re drunk. We need to have a serious talk about what happened at yours last week but I am not going to take my anger out on you during a session, that is terrible dom etiquette and abusive.</i><br/>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>If a dom ever hit you out of anger in the past during a scene, that’s WRONG, Agatha. I need you to understand that even if I am angry, I will never deliberately hurt you in a scene out of anger, or let it reflect in how I treat you while you are subbing for me.</i><br/>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>I will never punish you in any way that you have not specifically consented to and I will never punish you without explaining what it is you are being disciplined for. You can still safeword during punishments.</i>
</p><p>It once again takes Agatha several minutes to reply. As she’s waiting, Rio pulls up Instagram, trying to see if anybody has posted any photos of the gala, so she can catch a glimpse of what Agatha might be wearing. Seeing her sub wearing a hot dress or suit will help calm her down.</p><p>She thinks she sees her as a tiny blurred figure wearing a teal strapless dress sitting at a table near the back of the event hall in one of the official posted pictures. The idea of the lawyer, surrounded by her peers at the party but completely tuned out to everything going on around her as she hunches down to drunkenly text Rio from under the table, makes her release a fond, shuddering sigh.</p><p>When her phone chimes again, Rio almost drops it on her face in her haste to read the message.</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>i didnt know that</i>
</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>Well it’s true, you can safeword at any time during our sessions and everything will stop immediately, even punishments. Does that help you feel better?</i>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>yes. ok. thankyou. goodnight</i>
</p><p>Rio’s protective streak flares, like a sparking flame being fed oxygen. She has always felt a particular sense of needing to safeguard her subs, but never as strongly as how much she wants to wrap Agatha up in bubble wrap and make sure nobody can lay a hand on her. It’s a near-obsessive kind of fierce protectiveness. Not really all that appropriate, because they are not lovers, but she does believe it’s somewhat warranted since Agatha is in contract with her as a sub. And Rio knows she won’t be able to sleep properly tonight if she doesn’t know that she’s safe.</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>Agatha, be a good girl for me and when you get back to your hotel room, I want you to drink a glass of water and take two Advil pills. Make sure your door is locked and then undress, get into bed, and sleep. Don’t take a shower, I don’t want you to slip and bump your head. Just go straight to bed, do you understand?</i>
</p><p>A beat, and then two stuttered responses.</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>yes sir i understnad</i><br/>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>thankyou</i>
</p><p>Being called sir does things to Rio that she would never be able to describe to polite company. Her spare hand slips beneath the waistband of her boxers subconsciously. She jolts at the feeling of her own fingertips grazing lightly through her curls and over her clit, wrenching her hand free with an aggravated hiss, glowering at it as if it has betrayed her. <i>Bad Rio</i>, she scolds herself. <i>You are reassuring your sub and making sure she gets back to her hotel room safe, now is NOT the time to jack off!</i></p><p>She wipes her hand on her sheets and then replies.</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>You’re welcome. Be safe, okay? Good night.</i>
</p><p>Setting her phone on silent, Rio rolls over in bed to place it on the bedside table when the device vibrates three times in succession. She picks it up to check the messages and stares in utter bewilderment.</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>wait does this mean u like me</i><br/>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>like care about me or whatever</i><br/>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>would u still dom me I was a worm</i>
</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>Agatha what the actual fuck. What does that even mean?</i>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>i dunno its what all the kids are asking. i guess its like aa hypocritical if i was magically turned into an earthworm. would u still dom me if I was a worm</i>
</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>I doubt ‘the kids’ are asking if I would dom them. You mean hypothetical. And no? Because it wouldn’t be physically possible and I could squish you and I wouldn’t want to hurt you. And also I’m not attracted to worms. Sorry.</i>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>oooooooo so what im hearing is that ur attracted to mee</i>
</p><p>Rio blushes, and turns her face to hide it in her pillow in embarrassment, even though Agatha is two and a half thousand miles away and can’t see the crimson flush to her cheeks. Holding her breath, she types her response while biting her lip, the warmth in her abdomen making her feel a little light-headed.</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>I have literally called you pretty, beautiful, gorgeous, all to your face before. Of course I am attracted to you.</i>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<i>lol ur such a loser</i>
</p><p>Rio laughs aloud. God, what a perfectly <i>Agatha</i> response.</p><p>
<b>Rio:</b>
<i>GO TO BED. Sweet dreams, sweet girl.</i>
</p><p>She casts her phone aside and fidgets until she finds a comfortable position, coiled up on her side in the fetal position with one pillow beneath her head and one hugged to her chest. It takes a few minutes for her to relax, and Rio only manages to do so once she’s certain that no further texts are going to arrive from Agatha.</p><p>Tightening her grasp on her pillow, she exhales, her eyes slipping closed and her thoughts disappearing into an unconscious haze.</p><p>She drifts off to sleep wishing that it were Agatha in her arms.</p><hr/><p>The week flies by, and before Rio knows it, she’s parking her Mini in front of Agatha’s house again on early Thursday evening, her heart fluttering uncontrollably in her chest. The nine-day drought, where her only contact with Agatha has been through texting and only seeing her via pictures on social media from the legal conference, has been wearisome ideal.</p><p>On Saturday morning, Rio woke up to find, much to her amusement, that Agatha deleted all of the texts she sent whilst drunk. She has a sneaking suspicion that the lawyer was utterly mortified reading them over sober, and so tried to get rid of the evidence.</p><p>Later on that day, Agatha sent back the scene plan with a couple of notes, mainly addressing the punishment section of the plan, where she specifically requested hand spanking rather than paddling. Rio is delighted to see that Agatha has not spotted some of her wily sentences that will instantly give the dom an upper hand.</p><p>Rio saw two other clients earlier this week, and for the first time <i>ever</i>, Rio found herself actually getting <i>bored</i> as a dom during their scenes. And frankly, it both alarmed her and made her feel ashamed. Agatha has changed the entire game for her as a dom, and now every other sub she has pales in comparison to her.</p><p>Shaking her head, Rio focuses, pulling her backpack onto her lap from the passenger seat to double-check its contents. Sitting back in the driver’s seat, she closes her eyes and takes a few minutes to meditate, slowly sinking into dominant headspace. She breathes, and mentally unties all of the knots that tie her emotions to her actions, ensuring that she will remain objective during their session.</p><p>The anger that she harbours over Agatha denying her aftercare and kicking her out is squashed down and shoved into a tiny box. Once she feels centered and confident, she steps out of her car and marches up the path to Agatha’s front door, backpack slung casually over her shoulder.</p><p>Rio is nearly shaking with excitement. She’s been waiting <i>nine days</i> for this. She just knows the sight of Agatha wearing her collar will be a career highlight for her, and bring her dominant side immense glee and satisfaction.</p><p>She’s not accosted by two young boys, this time, as she strolls up the pathway, but she does catch sight of Agatha’s cat Scratchy perched on a neighbor's fence, delicately licking at his paws. He narrows his eyes at her, ear flicking, and then jumps down into the azalea bushes, vanishing from sight. Rio wonders absentmindedly who has been taking care of him while Agatha has been away. A friend, maybe? A neighbor?</p><p>When she reaches the porch, Rio pauses on the steps, glancing down at herself to check she is presentable. Her hair has been tied back in a slick high ponytail, and she is wearing very minimal make-up since she will undoubtedly be sweating like crazy later. She’s wearing a pair of loose-fitting black jeans and a baggy hunter-green Guns N’ Roses crewneck.</p><p>Beneath the crewneck… she’s wearing nothing but a black leather halter harness, the straps wrapping around her breasts and upper torso to form a pentagram, more for the aesthetic than support.  Underneath her jeans, she’s already wearing her favorite strap harness, which features a broad army green and black lace belt, black leather straps, and silver fastenings. Rio’s jeans ride low enough to expose half an inch of the lace belt that is hidden by her sweater.</p><p>Driving while wearing it took a while to get used to, especially since she prefers not to wear underwear beneath it, but now she loves the sensation of going commando, rubbing her thighs together and knowing that she will knock the socks off her sub the moment she whips her clothes off.</p><p>She just knows that Agatha is going to go completely feral on her, and perhaps even tackle her to the floor in her eagerness. She planned her outfit tonight on purpose because she has a feeling that Agatha will go crazy at the sight of her bare breasts and huge swathes of skin. She might be inviting her sub to bite her, but she’s willing to take that risk, because Rio looks hot as fuck in the halter harness and her strap harness.</p><p>Inhaling, Rio is about to lean forward and knock on Agatha’s front door when it is suddenly wrenched open in front of her before her fist can hit the wood. Agatha’s arm shoots out and a hand grabs Rio’s wrist roughly, yanking her so hard that she stumbles.</p><p>“Get inside!” Agatha hisses, dragging her into the house and then slamming the door hastily behind her.</p><p>“Oh - Jesus - what -” Rio stammers, nearly staggering into the wall because of the sheer force that Agatha uses to pull her indoors.</p><p>When she turns around, Agatha is peering out of one of the side windows to the door, biting her lip. She casts a quick, impassive glance back at Rio before returning to squinting through the glass, humming under her breath. “I don’t want my neighbors to know I came home early,” she mutters.</p><p>Rio snorts. “Your car’s in the driveway,” she points out. It’s not exactly inconspicuous. A matte black Acura NSX Type S that must have cost over 150 thousand dollars. It’s bold, obnoxious, and flashy. So it fits Agatha’s personality perfectly.</p><p>“I got a taxi to and from the airport and got dropped off two streets away so they wouldn’t be able to track my movements,” Agatha informs her, slinking into the living room to twitch the curtains back and peep out of those windows out at the street. “I asked Sharon from across the street to take my trash out for me tomorrow while I’m away and if she knows I’m home she won’t do it.”</p><p>Rio leans against the wall separating the hallway from the living room space, watching Agatha with a mirthful smile. She rakes her gaze up and down the lawyer, licking her lips. She’s dressed in black leggings and a long-sleeved monochrome floral blouse, and is padding around barefoot, her dark hair tumbling down her back in tousled waves.</p><p>Agatha appears a little bit frazzled, not as put together and pristine as she usually appears, but considering that she flew back in this morning, that’s understandable. Considering that her suitcase is propped up against the stairs, still packed, she probably hasn’t actually been home all that long. And yet, her sub looks just as delicious as always.</p><p>Rio wants to rip her clothes off her and suck hickies down the length of her neck and onto the meat of her breasts, marking and claiming her.</p><p>“You’re too lazy to take your own trash cans to the curb?” she asks amusedly.</p><p>Agatha shoots her an affronted look. “Lazy? No. I just want to avoid getting cornered and dragged into conversation by the Terror Twins and their nosy-ass she-devil of a cop mother.” Sniffing disdainfully, she finally seems happy that nobody has spotted Rio approaching and entering her property, and begins fixing the curtains to give them privacy. “You’ve met Billy and Bobby, it’s like getting harassed by a pair of feral raccoons. And believe me, their mother is <i>worse</i>.”</p><p>She thought the second twin’s name was Tommy, but maybe she misheard. “Fair enough,” Rio chuckles. God, she’s <i>missed her</i>.</p><p>No sooner has that thought flashed across her mind than Agatha begins to sidle up to her with a sultry expression as she sways her hips and looks her over with obvious bedroom eyes. “Hello,” she purrs, brushing invisible lint off Rio’s sweater. Her hand lingers on her shoulder, stroking down her arm. “Long time no see.”</p><p>She’s not surprised at all that Agatha is getting up close and personal with her so quickly, considering that she flew back early for what Rio suspects is this exact meeting. “Didn’t even get into the double digits in terms of days,” Rio teases her. “How was California?”</p><p>A slow, shit-eating grin spreads across Agatha’s face, her eyes gleaming. “I never told you I was going to California,” she whispers theatrically. “I said I was going out of state.” Blanching, Rio averts her eyes, clearing her throat as she thinks herself <i>shit, you really had to go and give yourself away</i>. “Rio Vidal, have you been stalking me online?” Agatha demands to know. When Rio simply sighs, realizing the jig is up, her sub emits a joyous laugh. “You have! You Googled photos of me and threw your lot in with the Twitter lesbians who stalk me, didn’t you?”</p><p>Rio sidesteps past her into the living room, slinging her backpack onto the couch - the very one that she ate Agatha out on last Monday. “I plead the Fifth.”</p><p>“Oh, don’t plead the Fifth in front of a lawyer, darling, I’ll take that as an invitation to eviscerate you on the stand,” Agatha snickers. Sprawling out on the armchair, she answers Rio’s previous question by telling her in an aggrieved tone, “I spent ninety percent of my time stuck in a conference center with terrible air conditioning, paying twelve dollars for coffee that tasted like shit, and being forced to listen to egotistical pigs brag about how they are incorporating Stark Industries AIs into our profession to replace paralegals.” She shrugs, twisting a lock of her hair around her finger. “So California was a horrible, hot, soulless hell hole. The <i>only</i> upside was the free drinks at the evening events.”</p><p>“Which you thoroughly took advantage of, from what I understand,” Rio says with a smirk. “I think we should talk about those drunken texts you sent me on Friday night.”</p><p>Agatha stares at her blankly. No expression on her face. But Rio spots the faintest spark of panic in her eyes. “What drunken texts?” she replies innocently.</p><p>“You know precisely what drunken texts.”</p><p>Shaking her head with an adorable nonchalant little hum, Agatha denies, “No, I don’t think I do. I didn’t send any drunken texts, don’t know what you’re talking about. You must be hallucinating me texting you. Damn, you must be <i>so</i> obsessed with me if you’re imagining me messaging you. You sure you’re not developing a crush?” She places her hand over her heart dramatically, faking an outraged gasp.</p><p>Quirking an eyebrow, Rio fires back, “You do know that if you delete texts from your phone they don’t necessarily get deleted from the other person’s?” The lawyer’s smug grin vanishes in the blink of an eye; now Agatha is the one appearing mildly panicked, although it’s only visible in her expressive eyes. The texts were deleted from Rio’s phone when Agatha erased them, but Agatha doesn’t need to know that. “Not to mention that I, unlike you, was entirely sober when those messages came through. I remember receiving them very clearly.” She approaches Agatha where she’s seated, looming over her and bracing her hands on each arm to cage her in. With a toothy grin, Rio whispers, “You can’t gaslight me, Agatha, although I applaud your effort.”</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha acquiesces reluctantly, which she then follows up with a firm, “No. We are not talking about the texts.” She lifts a hand to place it on Rio’s chest, pushing her back. Escaping the armchair, she heads into the kitchen, muttering under her breath, “Fucking <i>embarrassing</i>, I’m never drinking Californian wine ever again. It goes straight to my head. Didn’t help that they had no real food at that ridiculous party. Had to drink a whole bottle of wine on an empty stomach just to cope with all those <i>assholes</i> making fools of themselves by flirting at me. I mean, <i>look at me</i>.” She gestures at herself aggressively. “I literally scream dyke. I make it a mission to give off mean man-hating sapphic vibes at all times. Did they really think they had a chance?”</p><p>Honestly? Rio can’t even blame the men for trying. She’s acknowledged before that if she’d met Agatha in a bar she would’ve absolutely bought her a drink and proposed a tumble in bed. Although she supposes that if Agatha was wearing the lesbian pride flag pin that she previously mentioned in a text, they were just particularly ignorant and blind.</p><p>Pouring them two glasses of water from a bottle in the fridge, Agatha pushes it across the counter towards Rio. She regards her with a more cautious expression, chewing on her lower lip. “I wasn’t <i>wrong</i>, though, was I?”</p><p>“About what?”</p><p>“You are upset with me.”</p><p>Rio tilts her head. She has to step carefully here, because Agatha is already looking a bit jittery, and she doesn’t want to make her anxiety worse. But she also doesn’t want to lie. Because she is still angry about what happened, but now she is mostly confused.</p><p>“I am, a little. And from what I was able to piece together from your texts, you don’t understand why,” she replies honestly.</p><p>Agatha immediately wilts, ducking her head uneasily. The disquiet on her face in the form of a frown really tugs at Rio’s heartstrings. Sighing, she slides her hand along the counter and tentatively brushes her fingers against her sub’s hand. Agatha jumps at the contact, her gaze lasering in on where the dom is touching her before rising to meet Rio’s eyes warily.</p><p>“I will explain and you’ll be disciplined for your actions during the scene, and then we’ll put it behind us, alright?” she murmurs. Agatha swallows and nods slowly. “I think you <i>do</i> know why I might be upset, or at least you suspect.”</p><p>Agatha turns away and sniffs haughtily, puffing out her chest in what Rio recognizes as false bravado. “I’d rather you just tell me. If I get it wrong then you’ll get even angrier and increase my punishment.”</p><p>“I won’t do that,” Rio denies. Agatha shoots her a venomous look, pursing her lips. She begins to pull her hand away, clearly not believing her. And suddenly all Rio wants is to reassure her, convince her that she can be trusted. Snagging hold of Agatha’s wrist, she rubs gentle circles over her skin with her thumb, soothing her, “Hey. It’s okay. You don’t need to work yourself into a state over it. Look, I know you think you’re the perfect sub but I agreed to this arrangement to help you improve your submission, as well as to give you experience with a professional dom. I see this as a learning opportunity for you, not just an opportunity to tie you to a whipping post and lay into you with a crop.”</p><p>Agatha’s attitude switches on a dime, and she perks up, like a beagle who’s caught a particularly intriguing scent. “... Did you bring your crop with you?” she asks, wrinkling her nose with an impish grin.</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. “Really?”</p><p>“I want to see it!” Agatha insists, pressing closer, her blue eyes whining with excitement. “What’s it made of? Carbon fiber, or cane, or bamboo? Is it leather or cord-bound? Does it have a lash or popper on the end?”</p><p>Rio did actually bring her riding crop with her; it’s tucked away safely in her backpack, where it’s currently sitting on Agatha’s couch. Custom made and 70 centimeters long, it’s made of recycled dyed black leather with a natural cane core and a green leather pad at the end. Flexible and durable, it leaves the prettiest long, thin risen red welts on a sub’s skin, with a larger mark from the pad. She’s infinitely aroused by the idea of getting to use it on Agatha and decorate her body with bruises.</p><p>Slinking towards Agatha, she trails the fingers of her dominant hand up the lawyer's arm to tip her chin upwards, purring, “You don’t just want to see it, you want to <i>feel</i> it, don’t you?” Agatha nods enthusiastically. Rio chuckles fondly, giving her cheek a light tap. “Pain slut.” Stepping away, and shivering when she hears Agatha release a quiet but tremulous exhalation, she informs her, “I need to go the bathroom quickly. Drink another glass of water. Flying makes you dehydrated. I want you completely focused tonight.”</p><p>“You know they do sell bottles of water on planes,” Agatha says dryly. “They even give them to you for free if you fly business like I do.”</p><p>Not technically free when you’re paying hundreds of dollars for the privilege of business class… “The air on planes is re-circulated and has considerably lower humidity than usual, so flying can still dehydrate you.”</p><p>“Whatever,” Agatha says in response with a roll of her eyes, but she obediently opens up the fridge again to get the bottle back out and refill her glass.</p><p>Rio backs out of the kitchen and heads to where she knows the ground floor’s bathroom is located in the house from paying attention to the layout, grabbing her backpack from the couch as she walks through the living room. Locking herself inside, Rio looks at herself in the mirror over the sink, gathering her courage and confidence, allowing herself to draw her dominant side to the surface. Her shoulders relax, her spine straightens, and before she knows it, she is staring at Lady Little Death.</p><p>It’s time to get started. Rio sheds her clothes with practised ease, folding them and tucking them into her backpack. She’s instantly met with a chill in the air that causes goosebumps and her exposed nipples to harden; she tweaks them with her warm fingertips to get them used to the cold. Balancing carefully on one leg, the dom dons black lace stockings.</p><p>She adjusts the buckles and belt of her strap-on harness so that it sits comfortably on her hips, and then fishes out the dildo she bought specifically for Agatha from her bag. It’s the seven-inch galaxy patterned one that she masturbated and got herself off with while thinking about her sub and looking at photos of Agatha last week. She fits it into the harness, and notices that her hands are shaking because of the adrenaline flooding her veins.</p><p>She strokes her hand over the smooth silicone, ensuring the base of the strap sits directly over her clit. Rio exhales and dips her fingers briefly beneath the harness, shocked to discover how wet her cunt is already. Just talking to Agatha has already got her soaked.</p><p>Once she’s satisified with the strap’s placement, Rio lovingly draws her riding crop out of the backpack, testing its pliability in her hands. There’s a small metal ring attached to the side of her harness that she slips the crop into, and the small leather bulb where the shaft turns into the grip keeps it in place.</p><p>A pair of handcuffs, pure metal with no coverings, gets clipped to the metal ring on her other hip, along with dog training clicker with a carabiner. Agatha’s collar and leash are next to emerge from her bag of BDSM wonders, and these she just slings around her wrist for now, as she plans to leave them on the living room table to collect later.</p><p>And finally, she pulls out the pop quiz she prepared for Agatha: twenty five multiple choice questions on a single sheet of paper, fresh off the printer this morning. An exam concerning BDSM and submission, specifically topics about safewording, subspace and aftercare, to test whether or not Agatha read and studied her guide to submission. Rio wrote the questions herself. Which is how she knows that Agatha is going to <i>hate it</i>.</p><p>Now fully prepared, Rio steels herself and steps out of the bathroom. She drops her backpack by the stairs so she can carry it up to the bedroom later, and the collar, leash and exam sheet on the living room coffee table.</p><p>Holding her breath, Rio pads silently through the house back to the kitchen, prowling towards Agatha, who is drying their used and now washed water glasses with a teatowel. Her sub is nonethewiser to her closing in on her, and Rio feels very much like a fox creeping up on an oblivious rabbit.</p><p>Smirking, Rio taps the leather pad of her crop on Agatha’s shoulder, making her jump. When she whips around, surprised, Agatha’s jaw drops open in shock, and she stands there stunned, the tea towel slipping from her grasp and falling to the floor. Her pupils dilate so rapidly that Rio gets a front-row view to her blue irises disappearing and transforming into black. Her breath hitches in her throat, which bobs as she swallows dryly. Rio cocks her head to the side and drags her drop from Agatha’s shoulder up to just beneath her chin, smiling maliciously.</p><p>“By the Gods,” Agatha croaks, her eyes as round as plates as her astonished gaze wanders downwards to finally land on the seven-inch strap jutting out from Rio’s crotch.</p><p>When Agatha finally lifts her eyes back up to meet Rio’s, she looks <i>ravenous</i>.</p><p>“See something you like, pretty girl?” Rio taunts her, sliding her crop into its holster</p><p>“Oh, very much so,” Agatha replies, her voice dripping sex as she takes a step closer and stretches her hand out towards the strap, obviously intending to take hold of it.</p><p>Before she gets the chance, however, Rio pounces. She snatches the handcuffs attached to her hip and snaps them around Agatha’s wrists before her sub can even register what is happening. Agatha freezes, blinking down at her now-cuffed wrists in utter bemusement.</p><p>“What are you doing?” she splutters, trying to wrench herself backward.</p><p>Rio hangs on to the handcuff chain, refusing to let her go. “Just some pre-emptive restraints,” she laughs darkly.</p><p>She runs her fingers around the cuffs to check that Agatha’s blood flow won’t be restricted but they are snug around her wrists. The key to the handcuffs is in her backpack. She would usually keep them clipped to one of her strap harness’ metal rings, but given Agatha is an absolute evil genius, she would undoubtedly manage to pickpocket the keys from her and free herself, if she kept them on her person.</p><p>“What? Why!?” Agatha demands, displeased. She’s struggling already, tugging at the cuffs and attempting to maneuver around Rio, to flee from her.</p><p>Rio surges forward, hands on Agatha’s hips, pinning her to the kitchen counter. The lawyer’s handcuffed hands dangle in front of her, between their bodies, awkwardly. A faint whimper is ripped from Agatha’s throat when Rio lathes her neck with her tongue, tasting her sub’s salty sweat and delighting in her squirming as she sucks a hickey into the junction of her shoulder.</p><p>“You’re going to run and fight me off as soon as you say green, so I thought I would save us both the hassle of me needing to chase you down by getting you cuffed early,” Rio murmurs into her throat, licking over the bullied skin before drawing away, regarding her sub with a contented smirk.</p><p>“You can’t do that!” Agatha cries out in frustration, with a cute little angry stomp of her foot. Without being able to use her hands to shove at Rio, she’s forced to try and use her shoulder to push her away, but she fails, not able to move her body properly whilst Rio has her backed up against the counter. “That’s - that’s <i>cheating!</i> I haven’t even said green!”</p><p>“Is it? ‘Dom may attempt to restrain the sub upon immediate entry into the residence’. That’s what we agreed on in the scene plan,” Rio counters in a mocking sing-song song, tapping Agatha on her nose. “I have entered the house. I am free to restrain you as I please.”</p><p>Her sub’s annoyed expression falls into one of astounded disbelief, until it shifts into her looking <i>pissed</i> that she was outplayed. Rio swiftly withdraws her hand when her sub growls at her furiously and gnashes her teeth, threatening to bite her.</p><p>“And look! I have,” she brags triumphantly. “And it was barely any effort at all today. What a miracle.”</p><p>She expects Agatha to continue arguing with her. But instead, her sub just seethes, glaring at her. She huffs and looks away, perhaps realizing that since she <i>did</i> agree to the scene plan, she simply stepped into a snare Rio set for her, which is her own fault.</p><p>“I still say it’s not fair,” Agatha complains in a grumble.</p><p>“Life’s not fair, puppy.” Hooking her fingers around the handcuff chain, Rio gives them a yank, which jerks Agatha forward with a startled yelp. “This? After the <i>shit</i> you pulled last week, acting like a manic human chihuahua on steroids? This is comeuppance.”</p><p>Rio likes to think that she understands Agatha enough to be able to predict her reactions and movements, by now, and so when she lets go of the handcuffs and backs away, she waits, poised and ready to react. Agatha’s hands may be tied, but her legs remain unrestrained, and therefore it only makes sense that she will try and rebel in the only way she can - by running. If she can’t <i>fight</i> Rio, then she will attempt to flee. It would be futile, as the chase would inevitably end with Rio overpowering her, but her sub is not one to simply roll over in submission - not without making a fuss first.</p><p>And just like clockwork, Agatha tries to bolt for freedom, cackling wildly. She’s fast, Rio will give her that, but since Rio is anticipating her to flee, she’s able to react and act faster. Bending down, she’s able to dart in front and scoop Agatha up over her shoulder, lifting her off the ground into a fireman’s carry. She’s strong, thanks to the amount of purely physical work that she does - sex can really be a fantastic workout - and Agatha feels like she weighs nothing.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going?” Rio scolds her. “Running away? I don’t think so, my little escape artist.”</p><p>“Rio! Put me down!” Agatha shouts, hanging essentially upside down, her mane of hair so long that the tips brush the dom’s calves. She wriggles at first, but then Rio pretends as if she’s going to drop her and she squeals in protest, her handcuffed hands scrabbling and clutching onto the straps of Rio’s halter harness. “<i>Don’t you fucking dare drop me!</i> Urgh, this is so demeaning!”</p><p>“This is what you get for trying to run away.”</p><p>“I’m running away because you handcuffed me without my consent!”</p><p>“You consented when you signed off on the scene plan.”</p><p>Carrying her into the living room, Rio twirls in circles a couple of times to disorient her sub. She snickers at Agatha’s aggrieved whines and the way she frantically kicks her legs like a screaming, tantruming toddler. Her strap bobs with every step she takes comically, occasionally being caught by one of Agatha’s feet, which makes the dom jolt, as it puts pressure against her clit.</p><p>Rio throws Agatha down onto the couch as if she’s a sack of flour, and the older woman lands on the cushions with a winded <i>oomph</i>, scowling up at her. When she tries to scramble onto her feet and flee again, Rio pins her in place by whipping out her riding crop and pressing the leather pad to Agatha’s cheek, tutting chidingly.</p><p>“Ah, ah, ah,” Rio chastises her. Agatha snarls at her like a wild animal, baring her teeth. “Fuck, I can’t wait to get your collar and leash on you,” she mutters, regretting that the muzzle didn’t end up arriving on time, and that she hasn’t planned to gag the lawyer until later in the session. Dragging the crop’s popper down her sub’s face, trailing it down her neck, she warns, “Try and run again, I dare you. See how it ends for you. Hint - <i>badly</i>.” Narrowing her eyes, Agatha sinks back in the couch with an irritated huff, continuing to glower at her for ruining her fun. “Are we ready to get started?”</p><p>“I was born ready, sweetheart,” Agatha growls, that feral glint Rio has become so familiar with appearing in her blue eyes. “You better get yourself into gear because I’m waving a green flag so fucking huge that I’ll leave you in the dust if you’re not prepared.”</p><p>“Good.” Rio steps back and points her crop at the floor commandingly. “Then you will kneel, and I will explain to you how this evening’s infraction system will work. Once I have your agreement, I will collar you and we will begin.”</p><p>A disbelieving laugh bursts out of Agatha’s mouth, as she slumps down on the couch cushions. “You think it’s going to be that easy?” she grits out. “That I’ll just kneel for you because you ask me to? I thought we established last session that if you want my submission, you’ll have to <i>fight</i> me for it.” She curls her handfuffed hands into fists, playfully snapping her teeth as she mimes biting at Rio twice, before raising a sardonic eyebrow.</p><p>Rio stands there calmly, not rising to the bait. “So you’re not going to kneel?” she asks, rhythmically tapping her crop against her own thigh and using her other to lazily stroke over her strap.</p><p>“Oh, baby, you’ll have to <i>make me</i>,” Agatha challenges. She scoots to the edge of the couch and then rises to her feet, shuffling forward until she’s entering Rio’s personal space. Smirking, she spits down on Rio’s feet, very clearly trying to provoke her as she jeers, “Come on, you’re just aching to smack me around again, I can <i>see it</i>. You <i>loved</i> getting to put me in my place last session, admit it.” She slides closer, until Rio’s strap is pressed between her thighs. “Your cunt was <i>dripping</i>, and I bet you’re soaked right now just at the idea of wrestling me to the floor and pinning me down like a wild animal.”</p><p>Rio laughs at her, forcing a cruel tone, which Agatha appears to startle at. “I don’t have to do anything. Because you are going to change your mind,” Rio tells her boldly.</p><p>The lawyer snorts as if to say <i>yeah, right</i>, so the dom tosses her crop-wielding arm up onto Agatha’s shoulder, teasingly grazing the leather popper over her sub’s ass from behind. She runs the fingers of her spare hand up and down the length of her strap so that it nudges up against her clit, giving her a small amount of stimulation.</p><p>“Don’t believe me? That’s fair,” Rio hums. “I would be willing to hedge a hefty bet that the punishment system I have constructed for you tonight will not function like any you have ever experienced before.”</p><p>“I work in the justice system, so I sincerely doubt it,” Agatha sneers. “And you think I haven’t had doms punish me before? You’re all the same. Unimaginative sadists who want to make their subs blubber and beg for forgiveness.”</p><p>Unimaginative, huh? Oh, Agatha will be eating her word soon enough. And she <i>will</i> be begging very soon. Rio releases her strap and picks up the purple leather collar she left earlier on the coffee table, and almost immediately, Agatha’s attention switches onto it. Her eyes track it as Rio plays with the collar in her hands, her breathing growing shallow and vapid, faltering whenever Rio thumbs at the buckle and the attached tag.</p><p>“The typical system works by having rewards given for good behavior and obedience, such as following orders, treating your dom with respect, being eager and pliant,” Rio tells her casually. “Bad behavior and disobedience translate into spanking and negative punishment - taking something away from the sub that they enjoy or desire.”</p><p>Agatha chuckles dryly, and if her hands weren’t handcuffed together, she would probably be crossing them over her chest. Her gaze is sharp and dangerous. She looks like a cornered predator, a cat twitching her tail as she watches another, waiting for the opportunity to ambush Rio. “Last session you wouldn’t let me eat you out, and you <i>know</i> how that turned out. Negative punishment doesn’t work on me. I mean, you’ve said it yourself, I’m a brat. It just inspires worse behavior,” she shrugs, with a contemptuous smile.</p><p>Rio raises her spare hand, snaps her fingers, and points at her with a grin. “Precisely. Hence why I’ve decided to change things up. You’re going to take a trip across my lap tonight, whether you like it or not.”</p><p>Agatha, as she predicted she would, pricks her ears upon hearing that, her shoulders dropping down. She maintains a cool demeanor, but if she had a tail, it would give her away by wagging. She <i>loves</i> the idea of being spanked.</p><p>Quirking an eyebrow, Rio continues, “And the problem is that I think you <i>will</i> like it, the insatiable little pain slut that you are. If I tell you that bad behavior will increase the number of swats you get, you’ll transform into a fucking terror.” Agatha raises her eyebrows but also subtly nods in agreement. “So instead… we’re going to combine spanking with negative punishment.”</p><p>Agatha frowns, parroting, “Combine?” with suspicion.</p><p>And she is right to be suspicious. “Mm-hmm. You’ll start with thirty strikes on your ledger. With any infraction, whether that be you disobeying an order, giving me attitude and snark, trying to escape your bindings, yanking at your collar, or <i>anything else</i> I consider bad behavior… I will take strikes off.”</p><p>She sees it, the precise moment that it starts to dawn on Agatha, as her words sink in. Watches on in jubilant glee as horror spreads over Agatha’s face as she realizes that acting like a brat, fighting Rio, and resisting submission means that she <i>won’t</i> get to be spanked like she wants to.</p><p>“I, as your dom, decide what behavior is considered punishable, and I decide how many strikes get deducted,” Rio states. “You mouth off at me? You lose a strike, and depending on how it makes me feel, you could lose more. You disobey a direct order? That’s another strike gone.”</p><p>“So you’re going to punish me by <i>not</i> punishing me?” Agatha responds incredulously. But then she stands up straighter, rocking on her heels and grinning wolfishly as she jabs, “So what, if I run out of strikes completely do I just get to skip out on my spanking altogether?”</p><p>Rio laughs, pulling her arm off her sub’s shoulder to pat her head condescendingly, the crop returning to its place on her hip. “No. You’ll spend thirty minutes over my lap regardless of how many strikes you’ll get. You run the tally down to zero? You spend the entire half hour bent over my thighs, gagged, without an <i>ounce</i> of stimulation.”</p><p>Agatha gapes at her. For a moment, she appears too shocked to speak. And then she looks scandalized. Because she understands the consequences of her actions now.</p><p>Nothing would be more torturous for Agatha than being forced to lie across Rio’s lap, completely still, completely untouched, for thirty minutes. So she will do everything in her power to avoid it.</p><p>Which means she needs to act like a good sub, if she wants to experience a proper impact play session. She needs to <i>actually submit</i> to Rio, and be not just pliant and obedient, but <i>polite</i> and respectful. Two things that Agatha finds near impossible.</p><p>And Rio knows it. It’s exactly why she concocted this punishment scheme. Took her a little while to figure out the nuances, but now, judging by Agatha’s alarmed reaction, she thinks it’s going to work a <i>dream</i>.</p><p>“You’re evil,” the lawyer declares flatly, with the same amount of surety in her voice that one would adopt when stating that the grass is green, and sky is blue.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio replies sweetly. That’s practically a compliment, coming from Agatha. When Agatha scoffs derisively and turns around, as if to sit back down on the couch, the dom swings Agatha’s collar around one finger recklessly, which once again captures her attention as she tenses, as if she’s scared it will fall to the ground. “If that’s not enough of a <i>deterrent</i> for bad behavior, you may be interested to know that you have the opportunity to add strikes to your tally with good behavior.”</p><p>Her sub grimaces. “God, you’re so fucking smug about coming up with this idea, aren’t you? You must think you’re a real genius, figuring out a way to manipulate me,” she snaps. Shifting on the balls of her feet, she raises her chin, her eyes bright, and announces, “You know what? I’ll play. Because you might think you’ve outsmarted me with your underhanded tactics, but finding loopholes is my expertise.”</p><p>Loopholes, huh? Well, Agatha can try, but since Rio is the one with control who is the one deciding what determines punishable behavior, she’ll still be able to keep her under her thumb. “Minus two,” Rio notes, with a tilt of her head. “For mocking me and calling my tactics underhanded.”</p><p>The older woman’s eyes widen. “We haven’t started yet!” Agatha protests.</p><p>“Oh, honey, you said green. We started as soon as the word left your lips,” Rio drawls. “And I won’t be telling you every time I subtract or add on strikes, because you should be focused on listening and obeying.”</p><p>When her sub clenches her jaw with apparent resignation - that she suspects won’t last for long - Rio slips the collar down her arm and uses her hand to tip Agatha’s chin up, grasping it firmly. Agatha tries to pull away, but the dom holds onto her handcuff chain to tug her closer, so she cannot get away.</p><p>She forces her sub to stare directly in her eyes, as she orders, “I don’t want you to try and keep a tally of the numbers. If you allow yourself to submit, it’s good behavior, and that’s all you need to worry about. Understand?” Agatha stays quiet, merely curling her lip scornfully. So Rio slaps her. Hard enough that it stings, but won’t leave a mark. “<i>Understand, whore?</i>” she hisses.</p><p>Agatha peers up at her with glassy eyes. She subtly tries to twist her wrists in the handcuffs, but when they don’t give at all, she appears to realize that her only choice is to obey. She could safeword, but Rio knows she won’t - not when they’ve barely started. “Yes,” she mutters.</p><p>“Yes, <i>what?</i>” Rio quirks an eyebrow, her tone sharp.</p><p>Grinding her teeth together, a small huff escaping her lips, Agatha forces out, “<i>Yes, sir.</i>”</p><p>“Good girl,” the dom purrs. And as the praise settles over her like a warm comforting blanket, her sub visibly begins to relax, her mind starting to gradually descend into subspace. Seeing that dazed expression appear on Agatha’s face makes Rio’s dom shiver in satisfaction. Clicking her fingers, she points at the floor, demanding, “Kneel. And stay quiet. You sit and <i>stay</i>.”</p><p>“What, you want me to bark too?” Agatha sneers. “Should I roll over so you can rub my belly?”</p><p>“<i>Down</i>,” Rio snaps harshly.</p><p>Slowly, with extreme reluctance, Agatha sinks to her knees in front of the younger woman. She keeps her head angled upward, to maintain eye contact, probably out of protest. She likely thinks that averting her eyes, staring down at the ground, would indicate further submission, and she still wants to uphold one small act of defiance.</p><p>“<i>Woof woof,</i>” she says sarcastically.</p><p>She suppresses the urge to laugh. “Guess the tag on your collar is accurate,” she smirks. It swings from where it's attached to the collar on her arm, the <i>ALL BARK, EXTRA BITE</i> inscription glinting in the lights.</p><p>“Oh, come closer, and I’ll show you how <i>accurate</i> it is,” Agatha hisses, lips peeling back to bare her teeth in a clear threat.</p><p>“Behave,” the dom orders, cuffing her ear. “You speak when I give you permission, like a good puppy.”</p><p>“Yes, sir. Whatever you say, sir,” Agatha replies back sarcastically.</p><p>Walking in a tight circle around Agatha, Rio hums under her breath as she pokes and prods her into adjusting her position. She nudges her knees further apart, and taps her lower back to make her straighten her spine, until Agatha is in the perfect tall kneeling stance, her handcuffed hands held level with her waist.</p><p>Smirking, Rio grazes the tips of her toes between Agatha’s spread legs, grinding the top of her foot over her leggings-covered core. Through her stockings, she can already feel how hot and wet Agatha’s pussy is getting just from being humiliated and ordered to her knees. She grins at the way Agatha’s thighs twitch and she emits a soft shuddering breath.</p><p>Rio holds out Agatha’s collar, unbuckling it. The extra padding has been added by the specialist BDSM gear craftsperson that Rio gets all of her toys and equipment from, the front of the tag, saying <i>SUB IN TRAINING</i>, polished to a shine. A beautiful pink flush appears on Agatha’s cheeks, and she licks her lips as she gives a small nod of consent.</p><p>This is the moment she has been waiting for. Rio caresses her sub’s cheek gently, with tender affection that makes Agatha’s eyes flutter shut. She wraps the collar around the lawyer’s neck, pausing briefly to give her a chance to safeword if she needs to, and when Agatha remains silent, she tugs it tight and slips the buckle closed.</p><p>Rio immediately performs her safety checks, making sure that she can fit two fingers comfortably between Agatha’s throat and the collar so it does not affect her breathing. Agatha’s safety is <i>the</i> most important thing to her during this scene, considering how physically intense it will be for her.</p><p>Once she’s happy that the collar fits and is sitting comfortably around her sub’s neck, Rio rears back to admire Agatha in her shiny new accessory. And oh, is it a breathtaking sight. She is by far the prettiest pet that Rio has had. Collared, handcuffed, bleary-eyed with flushed cheeks, she is the very picture of submission, even though she is still fighting. The effect is every so slightly lessened by the fact that she is still wearing clothes, but Rio plans to change that imminently.</p><p>She can’t help but imagine what it would be like to march a collared Agatha into Covenstead, the premium underground masque-BDSM club in the upper west side of Manhattan that Rio frequents with one of her other exhibitionism-driven clients. Rio imagines leading a naked Agatha on all fours, attached to a leash, through the club’s atrium, for all the other doms and subs to gawk and leer at.</p><p>Rio almost loses herself in her fantasy, gazing down at her kneeling sub, and how she is breathing raggedly with unfocused eyes as subspace wears down her spirited resistance. If they attended the club together, Agatha would spit and snarl at everybody else that comes near her, but nuzzle into Rio’s palm and purr happily under her attention.</p><p>Rio would use her riding crop to whip her ass black and blue and Agatha would gasp and howl for more, showing the entire club her strength and endurance, and everyone would look on with appreciation and wonder that Rio was able to tame such a beautiful and headstrong sub.</p><p>God, she wants it so badly. Maybe she will have a discussion with Agatha about the possibility of taking her there at a later date. She could wear a mask the whole time and use a fake name, or Rio could call her Puppy, so she’d remain anonymous. There’ll be no hard feelings if Agatha doesn’t want to go, but Rio has a feeling she might enjoy the chance to showboat.</p><p>“Gorgeous,” Rio praises, petting over Agatha’s head, stroking her thumb over her cheekbones, and then thumbing at the collar. “You know what this means?”</p><p>If Agatha were to follow her order to stay quiet, and not speak unless given an order to, she would stare back silently. Alas, Rio has no expectation that she <i>will</i> follow that command, and so is not surprised when Agatha can’t resist the urge to bite back. “That we’re a pair of kinky as fuck lesbians who get off on me wearing a collar and being treated like a pet?” Agatha says snidely.</p><p>Hooking her finger around the D-ring for clipping on her leash, Rio gives the collar a firm tug, and Agatha sways on her knees, wheezing. “Did I give you permission to speak?” she growls.</p><p>Agatha gives a one-shouldered shrug, as if to say, <i>kinda</i>, since the dom did ask her a question. Rio meant it rhetorically, though, and she knows her sub knows that. Agatha is just being a whiny brat for the sake of it. She mentally deducts points from Agatha’s strike total for that.</p><p>Maybe she should go and grab the chew toy gag out of her backpack… then again, Agatha snarking at her will end up making her punishment less enjoyable later, so perhaps she should allow her sub to dig her own grave. It’ll be the only way she learns. Rio deftly unfastens the top two buttons of Agatha’s floral blouse so she can push the shirt aside to better display her purple collar. Her actions inadvertently expose the top of Agatha’s cleavage and a hint of lilac rose-patterned lace.</p><p>“The collar means you are <i>mine</i>,” Rio murmurs possessively, slipping three fingers beneath the thick leather band so that it tightens around Agatha’s neck. She can feel her thready, rapid pulse as she presses down lightly on her left carotid. Agatha’s heart is <i>racing</i>. And Rio’s is the same, jackrabbiting within her chest from the flood of endorphins and adrenaline surging through her veins. “You belong to me. You are a toy, for me to use. A puppy for me to torture and play with whenever I please.”</p><p>Bending down, Rio tugs Agatha closer, until their faces are inches apart. Agatha’s lips part, her hot breath making Rio’s skin prickle, and her tongue darts out to wet her dry lips. Rio has <i>never</i> wanted to kiss her so badly. Instead, she pulls her hand free from her sub’s collar and slips her thumb into Agatha’s mouth, pressing down on her tongue. Agatha immediately tightens her lips to suckle on the digit, sliding and swirling her compressed tongue as best she can.</p><p>Her hungry gaze drags downwards from Rio’s face to the strap jutting out from her harness, as if she’s imagining what it would be like to take it in her mouth instead of Rio’s thumb. All in good time.</p><p>“So long as you wear this, Agatha Harkness, you are one thing, and one thing only. You are <i>Rio Vidal’s bitch</i>,” Rio tells her in a low caustic tone. Yanking her thumb free from Agatha’s lips, she rubs her sub’s saliva over her cheek and orders in a bark, “Say it.” When Agatha merely raises an eyebrow, upper teeth scraping over her lower teeth roughly as she makes a show of humming-and-hawing, Rio grabs her jaw and growls, “<i>A-gath-a.</i>”</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry, you didn’t give me permission to speak,” the lawyer replies, with a vicious little grin. “Didn’t want to disobey you, <i>sir</i>.”</p><p>Rio seethes. Her prior irritation with the older woman roars back to life. “So that’s gonna be your loophole, huh, puppy? Malicious compliance?” she grits out.</p><p>Following Rio’s orders to the letter, to the point of inconvenience. Well, if that’s how Agatha wants to play it… Rio is all too happy to knock her down a couple more pegs. She tightens her grasp on Agatha’s jaw until her cheeks bulge out. It obviously hurts, because a whimper tears from her sub’s throat as she tosses her head, trying to tear herself free. She fails, especially when Rio uses her other hand to grab a handful of Agatha’s hair at her crown, forcing her head still.</p><p>Agatha tries to fight her control, extending her handcuffed hands to tear and rip at Rio’s stockings, but the dom anticipates this. She sidesteps Agatha’s claw-like fingers and pushes her back into a sitting kneeling position by kicking her in the stomach, making her hunch over with an agonized, shocked gasp. Rio knows enough about human anatomy to know that Agatha will likely have a faint bruise later from the kick, but it won’t cause any actual damage, since she aimed for the solar plexus.</p><p>The dom in Rio trills at the sight of her sub’s pouty lip and tear-filled eyes, but another part of her - the part that cares so deeply for Agatha, is growing fond of her in a way that is forbidden for a professional to feel about their client - is screaming in protest, battering the inner cavity of her skull.</p><p>That soft part of her <i>despises</i> seeing Agatha in pain. But considering what Rio has planned for her sub this session, she needs to silence that small voice before it can interfere with her ability to do her job.</p><p>“I think you’re forgetting something important,” Rio snarls, withdrawing her crop from the ring on her harness to wield it at Agatha like a weapon. “<i>I am the one in control. I am the one who decides the definitions of good and bad behavior</i>. Weaponized obedience is very much <i>bad behavior </i>, sweetheart.” She gives Agatha’s cheek a light tap with the crop’s popper, relishing in her tiny squeak. “Now do you wanna take the opportunity to cancel out your cheek by obeying my order?” she allows.</p><p>Agatha eyes her warily, fidgeting with her cuffed hands. She seems to be mentally debating with herself, attempting to figure out how much impertinence she might be able to get away with. “I mean, ‘bitch’ is such a derogatory term,” she begins, with a long-suffering sigh. “And calling myself <i>yours</i>, is that really even culturally appropriate considering we have evolved so much as a society beyond the days of treating women like chattel and possess-”</p><p>Rio cuts her off by wrenching her sub’s hair, the crop’s leather pad pressed threateningly to the hollow of her throat. The older woman instantly shuts up, her breath catching.  If she gives the lawyer an inch, she’ll go a whole mile, and she can’t be lenient tonight. Not when she has punishment planned.</p><p>Trailing her crop up Agatha’s throat, over her jaw, she jerks it away when Agatha snaps at it, like an unruly puppy. realizing that simply threatening to hit her with the crop is not enough of a disincentive, Rio whips her once, on her shoulder. She doesn’t <i>want</i> to, especially after Agatha’s drunken texts where she iterated her expectation that Rio would hit her out of anger. But Rio can justify this strike to herself, because it has a purpose. It’s a reprimand, for snarking.</p><p>Agatha’s shirt provides a barrier so that the crop’s popper does not strike bare skin, but it still <i>slaps</i> as it makes contact, and Agatha jolts and yelps. It will sting for a while and leave a faint red mark later.</p><p>This time, when Rio points the crop at Agatha’s throat, she winces. Her heart <i>aches</i>, and for a moment she is terrified that she might need to call yellow, that Agatha is actually scared of her. But then she sees that Agatha is gnashing her teeth and growling at the crop furiously, as if the crop itself is what she hates, not Rio who is wielding it.</p><p>“Don’t test me,” she warns thunderously. “<i>Bitch</i> means female dog, which you <i>are</i>, so long as you wear your collar. And dogs, <i>dogs have owners</i>. So as your dom, as your <i>owner</i>, I say, be a good dog, and <i>speak</i>.”</p><p>A tense beat of frigid silence.</p><p>Agatha stares at her with a scrutinizing expression. For a fleeting second, Rio wonders whether or not she might actually have crossed a line. Her stomach twists, a lump forming in her throat. Whipping her, and demanding that she degrade herself, may be going too far. She waits, her pulse jumping, her anxiety growing.</p><p>Finally, Agatha puts her out of her misery.</p><p>“... I’m Rio Vidal’s bitch.” Despite her begrudging tone, Agatha’s pupils are completely blown.</p><p>Rio closes her eyes. Savors the moment, of Agatha submitting, of her sub surrendering and bowing down to her. Opens them, and demands, “Again.”</p><p>“God, really? Once wasn’t enough? Egotistical much?” she hears Agatha scoff under her breath, but when Rio tsks, tapping her crop warningly over her sub’s collarbones, she echoes once again, through clenched teeth, “I’m Rio Vidal’s bitch.”</p><p>“And what does that mean?” the dom prompts.</p><p>Agatha is teetering on the edge of subspace. She’s tantalizingly close, Rio can sense it, and all she needs is one last push off that cliff before she’s off drifting in the clouds, basking in the relief of letting go. All Agatha needs to do is trust her, and be willing to step off. And, peering up at Rio with those mesmerizing azure eyes, full of trepidation and desperation, she is privileged to watch her slowly let her guard down.</p><p>Exhaling sharply, Agatha’s lips turn downward, indicating she is displeased, but she obediently responds, in a monotone voice, “I belong to Rio Vidal. I submit to Rio Vidal. I obey her every order, my body is hers to use and play with however she wishes.”</p><p>Her tone would suggest that she is bored, that she getting no enjoyment out of this and is merely humoring Rio. But the dom sees straight through her facade. Agatha is very much getting something out of this. She may be a more dom-leaning switch, but she certainly does get some kind of pleasure out of submitting, although she reckons that she might be the only dom who has managed to work with her long enough and gained enough respect and trust to get to this point.</p><p>Softening, Rio praises her in a purr, “Beautiful. What a good girl.”</p><p>She tucks her crop away once again and cups Agatha’s face tenderly, reveling in the way her sub preens under her attention. Agatha leans into her touch like a cat begging for pets, her handcuffed hands twitching, as if she wants to reach out to her. She looks so stunning kneeling pliantly with her collar around her neck, pleading for Rio’s affection.</p><p>But there is one last thing she needs to do for Agatha’s safety, and it’s with extreme caution and gentleness that Rio requests, “I want you to take your collar off.”</p><p>Agatha reacts <i>badly</i>. With visceral astonishment, at first, which swiftly morphs into pure anger as her resource guarding instinct kicks in. She leans back on her knees, her hands flying up to protect her neck, to prevent Rio from taking the collar off. “Fuck off,” she snarls possessively. “It’s mine!”</p><p>Rio raises her hands in surrender and takes a step back, to demonstrate that she has no plans of stealing the collar back. “I won’t take it from you, just take it off and hold it in your hands,” she orders firmly.</p><p>Narrowing her eyes, Agatha regards her with suspicion for a moment, her gaze penetrating. Eventually, she seems to trust that Rio is telling the truth. Even with her hands cuffed - and slightly trembling - she is able to slowly unbuckle and remove her collar, holding it tightly to her chest, the tag jingling merrily in contrast to her tense apprehensive mood.</p><p>When Rio edges a little closer, she bristles and hisses, her hackles raised, but the dom ignores her, settling her hand on her sub’s shoulder and rubbing it comfortingly. Agatha doesn’t need to be treated like a feral creature out to attack her like she usually is, in this moment - she needs to be soothed and treated with kindness and patience. After a couple of seconds, Agatha relaxes, content that the younger woman isn’t going to try and take back her collar.</p><p>“Good girl. You can obey orders if you put your mind to it,” Rio smiles warmly.</p><p>This time, Agatha barely reacts to the compliment, staring at her dom shrewdly. She’s waiting for the penny to drop concerning her collar, her grip on it as tight as a vice. Sighing, Rio crouches down, so that she and Agatha are on the same level. The lawyer starts, surprised, blinking at her.</p><p>“If you take your collar off at any point during the scene, it’ll be considered safewording,” Rio tells her softly. “Your submission is a choice. It’s a gift, one I do not take lightly and very much cherish. You are my sub, and I respect you to know what is best for you. You wear the collar, you fall under my command. But you will <i>always</i> have the freedom to take it off.” She cocks her head to the side, confirming, “Okay?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha responds, swallowing. And then ducking her chin shyly, she murmurs a barely audible, “Thank you.”</p><p>She’s so sweet when she gets all bashful and appreciative. It’s a good look on her. Rio has never fully understood cuteness aggression before, but seeing Agatha like this, face flushed and head bowed and nervously shifting on her knees as she twiddles her cuffed hands, she wants to squish her cheeks until they pop.</p><p>“You’re welcome, <i>bizcochito</i>,” Rio says quietly, standing back up. “You can put it back on now.”</p><p>Agatha does so eagerly, and Rio watches on carefully to make sure that she doesn’t give in her to masochist tendencies and cinch it too tight around her throat. The dom slinks forward to check she can fit at least two fingers beneath the collar, as she could last time, and as she does so, Agatha’s deviant behavior starts back up. She freezes when she feels her sub rub her face needily up against her thigh, provocatively close to her strap, and catches sight of her cuffed sneaking around Rio’s leg to the coffee table, to grab at her leash.</p><p>She snatches it up before Agatha gets the chance, making the sub pull an annoyed face. “Ah, ah, ah. Not yet. So eager,” Rio teases, waving a finger at her. She orders, “Stand,” shortly whilst she coils up the leash around her hand, so she can clip it to her harness using the clicker carabiner.</p><p>Once Agatha has struggled to her feet, swaying a little bit and wincing from her sore knees, Rio glances over her rumpled blouse and leggings, which are beginning to look a bit damp at the crotch. She can still see a flash of Agatha’s light purple lacey bra from where she undid the top couple of buttons of her shirt, and now all Rio wants to do is tear her clothes off her so she is equally as naked as the dom, whose nipples are rock hard from the cold, as well as arousal.</p><p>Sidling up to her sub, Rio begins to smooth her palms down Agatha’s front, tutting as she cups her breasts and then slips them lower to her hips, which triggers the lawyer to stifle a moan. The sound causes a warm desire to erupt in Rio’s lower abdomen, flickering and crackling like a smoldering fire. Soon it will build into a raging inferno of arousal that will drive her absolutely crazy.</p><p>“Those clothes look a little tight, puppy. Are they too confining for you? Wouldn’t you be so much more comfortable nude? Nuh-uh. <i>No</i>,” she growls, slapping Agatha’s cuffed hands down when she tries to frantically undo the rest of her buttons. “What if I want to strip you myself? Don’t deny me the chance to unwrap my present, Agatha.”</p><p>“Gonna be hard for you to strip me with these on,” Agatha retorts, lifting her handcuffed hands.</p><p>She’s right. But Rio suspects that the moment she leaves to grab the key from her backpack, Agatha will bolt. And then the dom will have to chase her around the house, and once she does catch her and uncuff her, to get her naked, that’ll be when Agatha pounces.</p><p>What Agatha needs is an incentive. The punishment system is the solution to this. Kicking Agatha’s feet apart, to force her into a wider stance, Rio offers her, “I’ll award you five extra strikes, if you stand completely still and don’t move a muscle for the next five minutes.”</p><p>“Ten strikes,” Agatha counters.</p><p>“This is not a negotiation.”</p><p>“Oh, I think it is.” The sub grins wolfishly. “Ten strikes and I wanna ride your strap later.”</p><p>Rio grabs her by the collar and snarls in her face, “I said, <i>this is not a negotiation</i>. Five strikes, take it or leave it. You don’t wanna behave, I will get a pair of scissors and cut your shirt and bra off you instead of uncuffing you.”</p><p>“Are you insane?” Agatha scowls. “You can’t cut this blouse, it’s a fucking Burberry! And the bra’s part of a set, I won’t let you ruin it!”</p><p>Rio snorts a laugh. She has no idea what Burberry even is, but it sounds expensive, and of course, Agatha would be the type of person to collect lingerie sets like trading cards. She probably has a whole closet drawer dedicated to organizing her different sets by color, pattern, and material. She playfully mimes a pair of scissors with her hand, making tiny ‘<i>snip snip snip</i>’ noises with her mouth.</p><p>When her fingertips brush over Agatha’s blouse, she lashes out, seizing hold of her hands. “<i>NO</i>,” Agathas says firmly.</p><p>And suddenly Rio’s dom retreats, fleeing into her mind. Her submissive headspace slams into her from nowhere, and she is nearly bowled over by the sudden urge to lower her head and murmur <i>yes ma’am</i>.</p><p>Oh no. No no no. Nope. Rio shakes her head aggressively, which she knows must look strange to Agatha, who stares at her like she’s grown two heads.</p><p>No, she is dominating Agatha this evening. She is not subbing for her. She is <i>doing her job</i>. The one she is paid to perform. She mentally wrestles with the sub rearing its head inside of her mind to subdue it and stuff it back into its box, jamming it shut and sitting on it.</p><p>Not happening.</p><p>Rio yanks her wrists out of Agatha’s grasp and grabs one of her thumbs, bending it backward until she knows it hurts based on how the older woman bares her teeth and fidgets. Taking back physical control of Agatha gives her dom room in her brain enough to step forward again, and assert control.</p><p>“Do I look like I give a fuck about whether or not I cut your blouse?” she fires back. “Deal or no deal?”</p><p>“<i>Fine</i>,” Agatha acquiesces with an aggravated hiss. “Deal. Just keep your scissors away from my blouse.” She pauses and then adds, with a salacious grin, “I’d much prefer we engage in a different type of scissoring.”</p><p>“Oh I bet you would.” Rio snaps her fingers and points at the floor, commanding, “<i>Stay</i>.”</p><p>To Agatha’s credit, she does stay in place as Rio quickly darts out of the room over to the stairs, to fetch the handcuff key. She can feel Agatha’s eyes burning into her back as they follow her, the sub craning her neck to keep Rio within her sights. When Rio returns, she quirks an admonishing eyebrow when she sees that Agatha is shamelessly reading over the pop quiz exam sheet Rio previously left on the coffee table, not even having the sense to fake looking sheepish or apologize when she is caught, staring back at Rio as if challenging her to call her out.</p><p>“Speak only when spoken to,” Rio orders, which Agatha rolls her eyes but responds to with a sharp nod. “But I don’t want you muffling your sounds. I want to hear every single moan and whimper as I touch your body. I want to see how responsive my puppy is.” She hums thoughtfully, circling her sub with measured steps, playfully dragging the head of her strap over the backs of Agatha thighs. “Our second session, I think it’s time that I properly inspect what I’m working with. Have you ever had a dom do that for you before, Agatha? A full body inspection?”</p><p>The lawyer frowns, muttering, “I don’t… think so.”</p><p>Agatha would remember if a dom had. Rio likes to turn it into a whole event. “Oh, well it’s very important that you stay <i>very still</i>. No squirming or twitching. You think you can do that for me, pup?” Agatha licks her lips and nods again, this time more demurely. “Spread your legs, feet shoulder-width apart.”</p><p>Agatha does so, adjusting her posture at the same time and allowing her cuffed hands to dangle in front of her limply. She freezes when Rio begins to slowly unbutton her blouse, pushing aside the front panels to reveal the lawyer’s lace bra. It’s cute, something closer to a bralet, with delicate lilac lace roses and a sheer section that exposes her pebbled pink areolas. It hooks at the front over her sternum, rather than at the back, and so Rio flicks the clasps open with nimble fingertips, allowing the lace to fall free.</p><p>She cups Agatha’s breasts gently, weighing them in her palms and caressing her nipples with her thumbs. They instantly stiffen into peaks that are incredibly fun to pluck at because of the soft gasps it pulls from her sub’s lips. Agatha rocks her head back with a louder strangled moan when Rio pinches them so hard that her legs tremble from the pain. And yet the older woman doesn’t recoil away - she thrusts her chest out further, inviting the dom to tweak them more.</p><p>“Does my puppy enjoy having her nipples played with?” Rio whispers, twisting them between her fingertips and grinning when Agatha shudders. “You’re gonna turn into a weeping, drooling mess later when I use the clamps, aren’t you? Needy pathetic little slut.”</p><p>She uncuffs Agatha’s hands briefly, keeping a secure grasp of them, so that she can whip off her unbuttoned blouse and bra to strip the top half of her body. The clothes are tossed aside carelessly onto the floor, which Agatha seems displeased about judging by her grumble about her <i>six hundred dollar blouse treated like trash</i> but she doesn’t immediately lash out at Rio as she was concerned she might.</p><p>“Good girl,” she praises her gently, when Agatha allows her to restrain her hands again. She grasps her wrists and raises them to press a kiss to the back of each of her hands, which makes Agatha’s breath catch in her throat and her cheeks warm. “You’re doing <i>so well</i>.”</p><p>“You know, there is such a thing as leaning <i>too hard</i> into a kink,” Agatha mutters. “The more you use my praise kink against me to incentivize me to behave, the less effective it’s gonna become in the future.”</p><p>“It’s working now, which is all I’m worried about,” Rio snipes back. She thumbs her sub’s jaw roughly. “Don’t bite the hand that feeds you, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha puffs her chest out, her lip curling. “Well considering you haven’t let me eat you out yet despite us having sex <i>three times now</i>, I don’t think you’ve ‘fed’ me at all.”</p><p>Topless and on display, she seems to gain assertiveness, rather than becoming shy as most subs would. She’s proud of her body, and having Rio dote on her has bolstered her confidence to the point where she’s beginning to resist submitting again.</p><p>Oh no, Rio <i>cannot</i> have her start to fight back and disobey now. She has to squash this rebellious behavior immediately. Also, the <i>fucking nerve</i> Agatha has to suggest that Rio hasn’t given her anything, when she has literally awarded her multiple orgasms every single session and <i>outside</i> of sessions as well! Irritation burns through her veins like venom, and she clenches her hands into fists. She is the most generous dom on the <i>planet</i> considering what an utter <i>brat</i> Agatha can be, who she thinks definitely does not deserve any orgasms today anymore.</p><p>She wants to grab her crop and leave Agatha’s breasts covered in red marks, and listen to her cries and pleas for mercy until she apologizes. That, however, would be a reaction based in anger. And Rio will not allow herself to hurt Agatha disproportionately.</p><p>Instead of hitting her about the face or whipping her with her crop, Rio steps around behind Agatha, draws her hand back, and brings it down on her ass. <i>Hard</i>. Agatha is clearly not expecting it, because she leaps forward and up several feet with a squeal, whipping her head around to gape at Rio in astonishment. The hit doesn’t land as hard as it would if her ass were bare, but her skin will undoubtedly be red and stinging beneath her leggings.</p><p>Rio grabs her by the collar, yanking her forward to spit on her face. As the wad of saliva lands on her cheek, Agatha’s knees buckle and she keens, forcing the dom to carry half of her weight.</p><p>“Oh fuck,” Agatha whines.</p><p>“<i>That</i> is what you will be missing out on if you continue to act like a fucking brat,” Rio snarls at her. “You lose strikes <i>every time</i> you get smart with me, Agatha. <i>I don’t want smart.</i> I want an obedient dumb little puppy with nipples I can tug, and a wet little clit I can bat around like I’m playing swingball. <i>Don’t get fucking smart with me</i>.”</p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha gasps out, her voice strained. Then, with a hopeful lilt to her hoarse voice, requests, “Again?” shuffling on her feet.</p><p>“Oh, my snappy little puppy wants spankies?” Rio mocks her, tugging on Agatha’s ear sternly. “Too bad, you’re not getting any. That’s later on in the session, and you have to earn your strikes with good behavior.” She smears her spit over her sub’s cheek, forcing two fingers into Agatha’s mouth. She can see from the way Agatha grimaces that she’s resisting the urge to bite down on them. “Is puppy gonna behave or is she gonna keep being a smart-ass with me?”</p><p>“I’ll behave, sir,” she replies, her voice garbled from her mouth being full of Rio’s fingers.</p><p>Rio sincerely doubts that. “Then stay still and keep your mouth shut for the rest of your inspection.”</p><p>Agatha’s leggings are peeled off her body, revealing her pale, toned thighs and the lilac G-string she’s wearing that leaves nothing to the imagination. Rio motions with a finger for Agatha to twirl around, and although Agatha huffs unhappily at being asked to perform like a circus animal, she obeys. Her ass cheek is bright pink where Rio spanked it earlier, much to her satisfaction; she can’t wait to see her entire ass colored crimson after she takes her hand to it repeatedly later.</p><p>Now Agatha is naked, she begins her inspection with full focus. Running her hands up her sub’s arms, squeezing at her muscles, over the slope of her shoulders. Faint pink indentations mark her skin where her bra straps have previously laid.</p><p>Now she is examining her up close, Rio spots a light dusting of age freckles, the barest hint of wrinkles, and a peppering of tiny white scars from past nicks and scrapes over her torso. They don’t make her any less gorgeous, and show that Agatha has lived an active life in the sun for her past fifty years.</p><p>There is a longer, thinner scar on Agatha’s back, over her scapular, that gives Rio pause. She didn’t spot it before, perhaps because of the corset Agatha was wearing during their first session, which would have covered it. It’s healed and faded, and it’s therefore difficult to determine how old it is based on the scar tissue pattern.</p><p>It’s about six inches long and completely straight, aligning with her spine, and must have been deep considering the width of the scar it’s left behind. When she brushes her fingertip over it, Agatha tenses, turning her head slightly. She looks nervous. Understanding without her sub needing to speak that this is a no-go zone for her, Rio moves on, although her mind hovers.</p><p>What the hell made that scar? It looks clean cut - <i>deliberate</i>. Glancing down Agatha’s back, she’s alarmed to see even <i>more</i> scars, similar in that they are thin and linear, but only an inch or so long.</p><p>Those are not the kind of scars you get naturally. Not the kind you would get from accidentally falling and slicing yourself on a rock, or a fence. Rio’s heart drops like a stone in her chest, which feels constricted, her breathing stuttering. No, these scars look at if somebody has taken a pen knife to her back and carved lines into her, and Rio can only imagine how much it must have hurt.</p><p>“Don’t,” she hears Agatha rasp under her breath.</p><p>Rio freezes, her fingertip poised above Agatha’s back, about to touch another scar. “Agatha?” she says hesitantly.</p><p>“Don’t,” she repeats, in a smaller, weaker voice. She gazes at Rio with immense earnest vulnerability shining in her eyes, that makes the dom’s heart skip a beat. “Please. Don’t…”</p><p>Rio changes the direction of her hand, resting it over her hip instead, hoping to ground her.</p><p>Agatha flinches.</p><p>Rio recoils, feeling like the knife that was dragged across her sub’s back was just used to gut her. “Agatha?” she says cautiously, softly, trying not to spook her any further. She doesn’t want Agatha whipping around and rejecting her again, kicking her out. “Yellow?”</p><p>The older woman shakes her head. “No. Just - don’t focus on them,” she implores, in a hushed voice. “I don’t wanna think about that, not when I’m with you. I know you would never do that to me.”</p><p>Rio understands now.</p><p>Somebody wounded Agatha. Intentionally. And judging by her reaction to Rio just very lightly grazing the largest scar, it was a traumatic experience for her. Rio’s head begins to pound, and she starts to find it difficult to breathe steadily, as a mixture of horror and rage is injected into her veins, burning through her like poison.</p><p>It wasn’t some random stranger who hurt Agatha. It was someone she knew. A past relationship, maybe. Someone Agatha cared about, somebody she loved.</p><p>Are these scars why she added scarification to her limits list - because she has engaged in that play before, and <i>hated it?</i> Did Agatha consent to being carved up like a fucking turkey? Rio doubts it - if she did consent, she hypothesizes that it was not <i>true</i> consent. Regardless of that, however, she has been permanently scarred as a result. The marks on her body do not lie.</p><p>She swallows heavily, simmering with possessive rage, because who the <i>fuck</i> hurt her sub? Who dared to break her skin, to use her an improvised knife sharpener. <i>Who does she have to kill?</i> But she suppresses her anger, schools her expression into something blank but not cold, because Agatha won’t know that her fury is not directed at her - she will think Rio is angry at <i>her</i>, when that is absolutely not the case. She is angry on her behalf.</p><p>Was it her abusive dominant ex who did this to her? Suddenly, punching Agatha’s ex in the face doesn’t seem like enough. Rio wants to wring her neck and strangle the life out of her with her bare hands. But now is not the time to think about that. Now, she needs to focus on Agatha, who is beginning to twitch anxiously.</p><p>It strikes her then, like a train slamming into her full force, that she can no longer bring herself to feel even a twinge of displeasure toward Agatha for her defensive behavior, where she clammed up and kicked Rio out of her house last week. She’s still <i>frustrated</i>, yes, but no longer mad. How can she blame Agatha for freaking out during a moment of sheer vulnerability, exhausted and worn out after being fucked to multiple orgasms by her dominant, when clearly she has every reason to be allergic to letting her guard down?</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio murmurs soothingly, running her fingers through her sub’s hair. She drops her head to gently kiss her shoulder, not even caring that it may be crossing a line. “You’re safe with me. You’re beautiful, scars and all. My perfect pretty girl. You are so good. So, so good.”</p><p>It takes a minute or so of the dom tenderly combing Agatha’s wild mane of hair while showering her with praise to comfort her, for Agatha to relax. The tension gradually leaches from her muscles and her her hackles lower, her breathing evening out.</p><p>“Green,” she hears her sub mumble under her breath. Signalling for Rio to carry on, to keep going. And maybe this is what she needs to help her forget, to banish the memory to the back of her mind.</p><p>If it’s what she needs, then Rio will provide. The dom circles back around to stand in front of Agatha, flicking a finger beneath her chin to encourage her to raise her head high. Grasping the lawyer’s head and turning it each way, she pries her mouth open with her fingers to inspect her teeth - pulling away just in time before Agatha has the chance to snap at her. And then she heads downwards - fingers grazing over her collared neck, dancing over her breasts.</p><p>Beneath her left breast there is a small section of frosted-looking skin, indicative of a tattoo removal. She wonders what tattoo Agatha got removed, and why. Agatha seemed fascinated by the full-length back tattoo Rio has, of a raven with her wings flared and draped over her shoulder blades, with nightshades, chrysanthemums, ivy and asphodel blooms flowing down vines following her spine. Maybe she will ask her later, and gently probe for information about the tattoo. It must be a bad reminder of something, if she had it removed.</p><p>Winding around Agatha’s waist and hips, Rio flattens her palm over her belly, lingering over where she knows Agatha’s womb lies nestled beneath her intestines. The entire time, Agatha appears to be trying to stay as still as a statue, not reacting to her touch. She may be a master of her own body, but she cannot suppress natural reflexes.</p><p>Rio bends over to trail her fingers up her calves, which contract and tense at her touch. Agatha has given her bush a neat trim, and the state of her arousal is evident based on how wet her dark curls are. The dom traces up her sub’s inner thighs, continuing to tease her there until she’s shivering all over, covered in goosebumps.</p><p>When Rio feels Agatha’s cuffed hands brush over the top of her head, fingers raking through hair, she rears back and growls furiously, “Did I give you permission to touch me? Keep your dirty hands to yourself.”</p><p>Agatha groans but pulls her hands back. Only then does Rio push her G-string aside and kneel, beginning to inspect her cunt. She uses her thumbs to part Agatha’s plump cunt lips, whistling in admiration at how red and swollen her little clit is, her clitoral hood already retracted. She exhales hot air over the tiny muscle, and Agatha releases a choked sound, her legs trembling.</p><p>The G-string takes seconds to remove, and Rio throws it over her shoulder while taking note where it lands on the couch, so she can pilfer it later. The dom dips just the tips of her fingers inside Agatha’s hole and spreads them apart just within her entrance, chuckling when a thick string of slick drools out of her, decorating her fingers.</p><p>“Somebody got all excited after being spanked,” Rio laughs. “Oh, puppy, you’re soaked already. You’re dripping on your nice hardwood floors.”</p><p>Twisting her fingers around and pushing them deeper inside her hot walls prompts Agatha to mewl, especially when Rio crooks them up to stroke over her G-spot. She so badly wants a taste, and when she withdraws her fingers to suck them into her mouth, she moans at the tangy flavor of <i>Agatha</i>. Her brain becomes all fuzzy and her body tingles, dom space fully sinking in.</p><p>Darting forward, Rio pries her sub’s legs further apart and laps at her clit with her tongue, shoving her fingers back inside Agatha’s pussy one at a time to stretch her out. She manages three, and is about to squeeze in the tip of her pinky finger, when one particularly enthusiastic swipe of her tongue triggers Agatha’s cuffed hands to once again fly to her hair.</p><p>She rumbles disapprovingly, about to pull back to chide her; then, she hears Agatha crying out in a chant, “<i>Rio, Rio, Rio</i>,” and realizes that Agatha is grasping her head not to encourage her to keep going or push her away, but simply because she’s about to fall over. She is struggling to continue standing under her assault.</p><p>The dom only lets up and frees her fingers from the lawyer’s clasping hole when Agatha stumbles backward, the back of her knees hitting the coffee table. Lurching to her feet, she wraps one arm around Agatha’s waist to steady her, feeling a teensy bit guilty at how disoriented and dizzy her sub appears to be. But that dazed, euphoric expression on her face indicates her descent into subspace, which is fantastic.</p><p>She feeds the fingers of the hand that was just inside of Agatha into her sub’s mouth, and she instinctively suckles at them. Tasting herself appears to help ground her, because Agatha wrinkles her nose and releases a strange throttled keen, her tongue curling around Rio’s fingers.</p><p>“Now it’s time for your leash,” Rio decides, and keeping her fingers lodged down Agatha’s throat, she uses her spare one to unhook the coiled-up leash from the carabiner. “Kneel, sweetheart.”</p><p>Agatha’s knees hit the floor before she even finishes speaking, her chest rising and falling rapidly, her eyes wide and gleaming. Rio clips the leash to the collar’s D-ring before winding it around her hand until it’s taut, pulling on the collar and putting pressure on the lawyer’s throat. Extracting her fingers from Agatha’s greedy mouth, she uses the copious amount of saliva coating them to stroke her strap.</p><p>A subtle thrust of her hips forward grazes the strap over Agatha’s forehead, and she allows it to rest there for a second, enjoying the way Agatha looks with the seven-inch galaxy cock draped over her face. Before Agatha can open her mouth and lift her chin to try and take it into her mouth, however, Rio steps back, tugging on the leash until Agatha is forced to fall onto all-fours, barely catching herself with her cuffed hands. She appears exasperated, and clambers back up to her knees - only for Rio to yank on the leash harsher so she falls back down again.</p><p>This repeats another two times before Agatha hisses at her like an indignant cat and she obediently gets down onto her hands and knees without the need for a leash tug or a verbal command.</p><p>“Such a pretty puppy,” Rio coos, patting her head in a way that is distinctly patronizing. Agatha grunts angrily but stays quiet, shooting her a venomous look. The flush to her cheeks is telling; she’s vexed, yes, but she’s also turned on. “You passed your inspection, baby, full marks. But now I think we need to sit you down for your <i>other</i> examination, don’t we? Let’s test how thoroughly you studied my guide to submission. Were you a good girl? Did you do your reading?”</p><p>“Yes, sir. I read it,” Agatha responds flatly, but then her face twinges, as if she’s holding back a smirk.</p><p>Oh no. She does <i>not</i> like that Agatha is amused by something and is hiding it from Rio. It undoubtedly means trouble. “What was that expression?” Rio demands. Her sub shrugs, plastering on an innocent look. Jerking on her leash, so the collar tightens around the older woman’s neck, she warns, “Agatha...”</p><p>“I… may have re-written it,” she admits, fake-coughing through the last few words so they are more difficult to hear.</p><p>Rio, however, has the ears of a bat, after years of training herself to be able to pick up on the quietest and most subtle of noise cues from her subs. So she hears what Agatha says perfectly. She’s just dumbfounded by the statement and needs clarification, so she cinches Agatha’s leash until she’s grasping her by the collar, ordering harshly, “Explain.”</p><p>Agatha stares up at her without an ounce of care, entirely unintimidated. “Your guide needed some editing. So I edited it for you,” she says nonchalantly. “If you’d ever like to get it published, I could find a decent agent for you, but I would expect partial writing credit -”</p><p>She’s cut off with a ragged wheeze when Rio wraps her hand around her throat to shut her up, her other hand wrenching the leash upwards above where she is lightly strangling her to act as a choke chain.</p><p>“What do you mean, you <i>re-wrote it?</i>” Rio growls. When Agatha shrugs again with a mischievous grin, the dom releases her, letting go of her leash and lifting her leg to plant her foot on Agatha’s shoulder. She kicks her down from her kneeling position onto her side on the floor and thunders, “Bring the folder here, I want to see what you did to it.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs as she drags herself to her feet, wincing because of her bruised knees, arguing, “It’s in my bedroom.”</p><p>“Did I fucking stutter?” Rio taps her wrist, where a watch would lie if she wore one. “You have one minute. You fail to return in adequate time and you’ll stand in the corner facing the wall for twenty minutes.” See how her sub likes it when she treats her like the trantrum-ing child she is.</p><p>Agatha stills. She blinks as if she thinks she may have misunderstood. “I’m sorry, <i>what?</i>” she splutters. “You’ll - <i>banish</i> me to the corner for a time-out like a toddler?!”</p><p>“Whine like a child, get treated like a child.”</p><p>“I thought you wanted me to whine, like a puppy,” Agatha counters. “Or am I expected to start panting and sticking my tongue out now instead? You want me to wear one of those tail plugs so I can wag it?”</p><p>“Timer’s started.”</p><p>“<i>Fuck</i>,” Agatha mutters, and with one last piercing glare, rushes off to the stairs.</p><p>Rio grabs the exam sheets from the coffee table and migrates to the kitchen, if only because it amuses to think Agatha will panic when she returns to the living room to discover her gone. She begins setting up the dining table, taking slow, deep breaths to calm her heart, which is beating a mile a minute. Agatha is severely testing her patience - and to be honest, Rio has completely lost track of her strike tally - but she feels like they are making progress.</p><p>More importantly, she feels like she is doing a great job at remaining objective and squashing down her remaining irritation over her top drop. Yes, there were a couple of moments where she was maybe a little too cruel, but she doesn’t think that she’s suffered any major missteps.</p><p>Agatha is panting when she skids into the kitchen, her breasts bouncing from running and the leash draped over her back, hanging down her spine. Fifty-eight seconds. Two seconds to spare. She’s clutching the folder containing Rio’s guide of submission in her cuffed hands, and she tosses it down on the dining table before bending at the waist to heave oxygen into her lungs.</p><p>“Get yourself a glass of water,” Rio tosses over her shoulder as she takes a seat at the head of the table, absentmindedly petting her strap as it sets erect up from the harness, pressing into her stomach.</p><p>She hears the faucet spurting out water behind her as she begins to go through the folder - and immediately drops her head into her hands in a mixture of despair, frustration, and scorching <i>rage</i>.</p><p>It appears that Agatha went above and beyond in her studies of the guide, reading not just the assigned chapters but the whole thing. And the only reason Rio knows that is because every single damn page of the folder has been scribbled over in red pen; phrases crossed out and rewritten, notes in every margin, random emojis and crude penis doodles in the paragraph breaks.</p><p>It is literally unreadable now.</p><p>“You destructive little shit.” Rio wheels around, swiveling on the chair to glower at Agatha, who is sipping at a glass of water and watching her with a wicked smile. “You defaced it.”</p><p>“Defaced is such a strong, harsh word. Enhanced, is much better. More accurate. Honestly, I think I’ve improved it,” Agatha responds calmly. “Updated all your references, re-structured paragraphs, and really, some of the grammar in chapter 4 is simply <i>atrocious</i> -”</p><p>“We are going to have a <i>very</i> long conversation about you <i>ruining</i> my submission manual in our post-session debrief, but just know that this blatant vandalism just resulted in a huge deduction in strikes from your tally,” Rio interrupts her fiercely. Her cold voice has the intended effect: the smile vanishes from Agatha’s face, which turns ashen. She pushes the folder containing the submission manual to the side, and moves the exam sheets in front of her. “If you don’t ace the pop quiz, troublemaker, those thirty minutes you’ll spend lying over my lap untouched will extend to a full hour.”</p><p>And she knows that hour will be the most torturous and painful hour Agatha will ever experience in her life.</p><p>“I was just trying to help,” Agatha says, which is a very feeble argument and she knows it. Squaring her shoulders as she returns her empty glass to the sink, she boasts with certainty, “I’ll ace the test.”</p><p>Rio hits her with a stony expression. “<i>You fucking better</i>,” she bites out. She taps her toe on the floor. “Heel, puppy.”</p><p>Agatha slinks across the kitchen towards her and pulls her leash from out behind her back. To Rio’s shock, she actually offers it to her tentatively, the grimace on her face indicating that this is her attempt at an apology without having to say the words. She snatches it out of her palm and pulls down hard. Agatha actually appears almost glad to be ordered to her knees in a submissive position. when Rio clicks her fingers and points at the ground.</p><p>“I have a sinking suspicion that if I left you to your own devices to take the test, you would cheat. So I am going to supervise you, <i>very closely</i>,” Rio whispers, seizing her chin. “The whole purpose of a test is to stress the student, to test their grace and memory recall under pressure. And I don’t think your dining table chairs will place you under enough strain. They look almost too comfortable. So you know what?” She leans back in her chair, spitting in her palm and then lowering that hand to her strap, which is already slightly damp from Agatha’s spit earlier. She strokes up and down pointedly. “I decided to be a wonderful, kind dom and bring you a new chair to sit on.”</p><p>Agatha pales, her eyes fixed on Rio’s faux cock, as it dawns on her what she means. Her breathing turned shallow and stuttered as she chokes out, “Oh god,” realizing that Rio intends to make her cockwarm her strap for the entire length of her pop quiz.</p><p>It was a no-brainer for Rio once she read on Agatha’s revised list that she is interested in strapwarming, to incorporate it into this scene. Originally she was going to make Agatha sit on a vibrating suction cup dildo the whole time. When she was writing the scene plan, however, she decided that she wants nothing more than to rail the shit out of Agatha with her galaxy strap, until her cervix is battered and bruised and she can barely walk.</p><p>Rio came up with the genius idea to swap out the dildo for a strap, that <i>she</i> would wield. She wants Agatha writhing like a bitch on heat on her lap, her cock buried inside of her so deep that it will leave her sub feeling empty and hollow once it's removed, like something is missing from her. She has no doubts that Agatha will be able to take it, despite its girth and impressive length. She gives off the vibes of a serious size queen.</p><p>Turning on her chair, Rio jerks the leash to yank Agatha forward, so she’s spurred into walking on her knees until she is framed by Rio’s own spread legs. Winding the leash around her hand, Rio now tugs downwards, until Agatha’s head is bowed and her lips are a mere inch away from her strap. The lawyer gazes at it thirstily, gulping.</p><p>“You want a taste, don’t you, baby?” Rio croons, petting her hair. “Why don’t you say hello?”</p><p>Agatha hesitantly presses her lips to the side of her length, kitten-licking the strap, flattening her tongue with every upward caress. The dom unbuckles the clicker attached to the carabiner on the waist of her strap harness.</p><p>She grabs a fistful of Agatha’s hair to gently lift her off her cock for a second, offering her the dog clicker. “You remember what this is for?”</p><p>Agatha awkwardly manages to shuffle back so she can lift her cuffed hands and take the clicker into her dominant one. “Two clicks for yellow, three for red,” she recalls. Quirking an eyebrow, she adds, “And frankly that you think I might need to safeword during a little strapsucking is insulting.” Rio narrows her eyes, which triggers her to sigh and iterate, “I will use it if I need to. If I feel unsafe or uncomfortable. If I no longer wish to continue. <i>See</i>, I did study your ridiculous folder. And don’t ask me if I’m green right now, I’m greener than England’s spring countryside. And that country is ninety percent fields. I’m <i>ready</i>.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio says simply.</p><p>And then using her grip on a fistful of Agatha’s hair, she thrusts her hips upwards so that her strap pokes at the lawyer’s lips, until they yield, and the cock slips inside. Agatha’s eyes flutter closed and she moans around Rio’s strap appreciatively, sucking and sliding her mouth up and down the first couple of inches. Every so often she tips her head back and cracks her jack open wide to give Rio a perfect view of the strap’s realistic head perched upon her tongue.</p><p>“Be a good girl and get her nice and wet, puppy,” Rio encourages her. “We want her sliding <i>deep</i> inside of you when you sit on her for your exam, don’t we?”</p><p>The older woman is quite the performer, and hell, she might be the best cocksucker Rio has ever had for a sub. Every time Agatha bobs her head, she takes a little more of the cock, so that the strap’s base nudges up against Rio’s clit to give her a burst of pleasure. Before long, the dom is breathing heavily, hips subconsciously rutting forward to force Agatha to take more as heat blossoms in her belly, the pleasure washing over her like waves lapping at a sandy shore.</p><p>“God, you’re fucking begging for it, aren’t you, you slut? I think I told you last session that I was going to make you deepthroat her, so you realize just how big she is before I destroy you,” Rio purrs, using her hold on Agatha’s leash to pull her further down the length of her cock.</p><p>The strap slides deeper and deeper into her sub’s mouth until Agatha’s throat bulges outwards, and her lips are touching the base of the strap. Her beautiful blue eyes water, tears pricking at the corners of them, as she peers up at Rio with pure adoration. Agatha doesn’t fight or resist, allowing Rio to hold her there to the hilt, with her fingers curled into her collar and other hand on the back of her head.</p><p>She can’t breathe properly with the strap down her throat, so Rio does, every ten seconds or so, let her withdraw ever so slightly to gasp in a breath around the head of her strap before thrusting the whole length back into her mouth. Spit drools from her lips as a result, dipping down onto her bare breasts.</p><p>She could take full control and fuck Agatha’s mouth until she comes, but Rio much prefers this - watching Agatha eagerly swallowing down her strap like a true cockslut, Rio’s hand in her hair guiding her movements. Agatha is showing such gleeful enthusiasm that Rio doesn’t need to use any force.</p><p>Besides, she wouldn’t want to do that anyway. Part of her is concerned that it may cause Agatha to panic and trigger a trauma response. Given how badly doms have treated her in the past and abused her, she would sadly not be surprised if one pushed her past her limits during an act like this.</p><p>As Agatha deepthroats her strap, holding there for a few seconds, as she basks in the sensation of her collar-restrained throat being blocked, Rio is starkly reminded of the fact that Agatha does not have a gag reflex. She must have trained herself out of it and become an expert at suppressing it when she needs to. It arouses and awes her to no end to imagine Agatha training her throat with her own strap, practicing until she’s able to control her gag reflex and hold her breath with a fake dick shoved to the back of her mouth.</p><p>But Rio is greedy, and a sadist, and she enjoys hearing her subs choke on her huge straps. “You don’t have a gag reflex, do you, pretty girl? Why don’t you fake some pretty gags for me, while you’re stuffing your mouth full?” Rio suggests with a dark smile, desire flickering away like a low burning flame in her abdomen. “Put on a show as you facefuck yourself like a cock-hungry whore.”</p><p>Agatha gurgles around her strap, her eyes shuttering in a slow blink of agreement. She pulls off Rio’s cock for a second to suck in a frantic breath, nuzzling against the strap’s head, before shoving her head back down until her nose hits Rio’s lower abdomen. The second she dramatically fakes a gag, allowing tears to fall and trail down her cheeks, Rio nearly comes on the spot.</p><p>“God, you look so fucking hot like this Agatha, your mouth full of my cock,” she praises, her voice broken.</p><p>She bucks, striking the back of her sub’s throat with her strap head, which of course Agatha then fakes yet another gag after. She is genuinely so close to orgasm that she’s tensing with the effort of holding back, at this point. No sub has <i>ever</i> made her come from sucking her strap before.</p><p>“I can see the bulge of it in your throat beneath your collar. This is what you wanted, isn’t it? You wanted my strap down your throat to shut you up. This is where you belong, on your knees and worshipping me. I’m gonna come, you gonna swallow it all like a good girl? Like a good bitch?”</p><p>A muffled groan escapes Agatha’s lips, which are stretched around the thick girth of the strap. Bobbing back and forth a couple of times, she descends one last time and holds herself there, Rio’s cock buried so far down her throat that her nose ends up smushed up against the base of the strap, her face buried in Rio’s stomach. Her head reels from the sensation, and she chokes out a low moan. Rocking her hips back and forth until she’s on the very edge of coming, Rio releases Agatha’s head when ten seconds have passed, so she can retreat and breathe.</p><p>But she doesn’t. Agatha doesn’t pull off. Her eyes flash upwards to meet Rio’s, and through the brimming tears, they glimmer with mischief. Rio suddenly feels like she’s missed something important. When her sub forces the strap even deeper into her mouth, Rio is struck with a spark of dread, realizing… Agatha is turning pale. She’s not breathing through her nose. And she apparently has no plans to.</p><p>“Okay, sweetheart, ease off a bit there, you’re going to suffocate yourself,” Rio tuts, tugging a handful of her hair to encourage her to withdraw.</p><p>But Agatha doubles down, dropping the clicker in her palm onto the ground and raising her cuffed hands to wrap around Rio’s right leg; she pins it in place, while also anchoring herself. As her face gets whiter and whiter, nearly a minute having passed now without her taking a single breath, Rio starts to panic. Agatha is going to pass out. She is going to faint from lack of oxygen and it’ll be Rio’s fault.</p><p>She shifts on the chair to try and dislodge Agatha from her strap, which fails, and then frantically pushes on her forehead, which also doesn’t work and actually seems to make the situation worse; the lawyer digs her teeth slightly into the strap so that Rio cannot physically pull her off without damaging it.</p><p>Even wiggling her fingers around Agatha’s collar, at the back of her neck, and yanking hard, doesn’t work. In fact, doing that triggers a rumbling growl that erupts from deep within Agatha’s chest, possessive and threatening, like a wolf guarding its kill, a dog refusing to let go of its chew toy. Only in this case, <i>Agatha</i> is the wolf and Rio’s strap is the chew toy.</p><p>Part of her, the small submissive voice at the back of her mind, encourages her to give in. To give up control, to let Agatha use her like a toy. Rio bats those thoughts away furiously. Not the fucking time!</p><p>“<i>Agatha</i>. Enough! Get off! You need to breathe!” she shouts.</p><p>She is about to call safeword for Agatha’s sake more than anything, because Rio is starting to think that Agatha will <i>never</i> call red or say safeword willingly, when the older woman lets up. Agatha raises her hand and loosens her grip on Rio’s leg, the strap emerging from her lips with a <i>pop</i>, coated in saliva.</p><p>She immediately suffers a coughing fit from having an obstruction in her throat for so long, and Rio takes the weight of her body as she leans forward on her knees, slumping in the dom’s lap.</p><p>“Fucking hell, were you trying to make yourself pass out?” Rio sighs. She combs her fingers through her sub’s sweaty dark mane of hair, trying to help calm her as she trembles and gasps in oxygen. “Jesus. Deep breaths, that’s it, good girl. Why didn’t you ease up when I ordered you to?”</p><p>Agatha wheezes as she recovers, her expression slightly dazed, but a small smirk graces her face as she answers hoarsely, “Sorry, couldn’t hear you.”</p><p>Rio stares at her in disbelief. Couldn’t hear her? She was <i>yelling</i> near the end. “I doubt that.”</p><p>Agatha rests her chin on Rio’s thigh as her breathing gradually steadies out, wiggling her eyebrows. “Shame we had to stop there. I was getting so close to subspace, you know?” she says, putting on such a fake disappointed voice that it’s nearly comical. “That wonderful fuzzy feeling at the back of my head, my heart pounding in my ears, my limbs feeling all floppy.”</p><p>Pinching the bridge of her nose in exasperation, Rio exhales. “Agatha, that’s <i>oxygen deprivation</i>, not subspace!” she gripes.</p><p>“Oh, is it? I had no clue, it just seems like all the symptoms of subspace are so v<i>ery similiar</i> to other medical phenomena,” Agatha goads. She slowly climbs to her feet, and Rio allows her to, even offering a hand to help. But then she takes a seat straddling Rio’s thigh, gyrating her soaking wet cunt down as she dramatically declares, “I’m <i>so sorry</i>, I was just confused.”</p><p>“You’re not sorry at all.”</p><p>“I <i>could</i> be.”</p><p>Rio hits her with a flat stare. “You’re not.”</p><p>“That’s not the point,” Agatha attests with a sly cat-like grin. “The <i>possibility</i> of me being sorry exists, and I am saying the words. Isn’t that more important than whether or not I mean them? <i>You</i> don’t know whether I actually do or not, you’re just interpreting. So you should always give me the benefit of doubt.” Winking, she adds, “You should consider that when you’re tallying up my strikes.”</p><p>Tipping her head back with a silent groan, Rio simultaneously fights back a smile.</p><p>Here she was worried that she might accidentally be too forceful with Agatha when she was deepthroating her, when Agatha is in fact a complete slut for strapsucking. Rio is going to kill her. She absolutely choked herself out on the strap on purpose, just so they could have this precise argument. Agatha is trying to make a point about how she <i>still</i> doesn’t think subspace is a real thing.</p><p>She’s such a fucking brat. Argumentative, combative, an <i>asshole</i>. Yet… Rio has become irrevocably attached to her. The fondness that she feels towards her is soft and gratifying, and she wouldn’t take her any other way. Agatha is manipulative, seductive, and charming to the point where it is dangerous how fast it makes Rio’s heart race. And fuck… Rio loves it. She loves Agatha.</p><p>Her brain short circuits.</p><p>Wait, she means - she means she loves her as in she <i>cares</i> about her. As a client. As a friend. As a… fuck buddy. Not - not romantically. <i>Surely not romantically</i>.</p><p>Clearing her throat and shaking that thought violently out of her head, Rio swings her legs closed and lifts Agatha’s, pressed between the junction of her thighs, so that she’s straddling her whole lap now, rather than just her thigh. She shortens her leash, so that constant pressure is applied to her neck; a reminder that although she may be sitting on top of Rio right now, the younger woman is the one with ultimate control of her.</p><p>Agatha has drenched Rio’s leg from rubbing her bare pussy over it, humping at her like a horny puppy. Now, Agatha sits essentially on the base of the harness, the length of Rio’s strap resting between her curls with her clit pressed up against it. She ruts against it eagerly, handcuffed hands stroking it and measuring how deep it will reach inside of her when she sits upon it. Rio is vibrating from excitement, impatient for the moment she will see Agatha slide down her strap, which her greedy cunt will undoubtedly gobble up effortlessly.</p><p>“Well you’ve certainly racked up an impressive mixture of infractions and extra strikes from that performance, and it seems like you’re ready to earn some more,” Rio notes, clapping her hands onto Agatha’s ass cheeks, squeezing them.</p><p>Keening, Agatha drops her forehead to rest on Rio’s shoulder. The dom stills when Agatha mouths at her collarbone, lapping over it with her tongue gently. She’s waiting for her unruly sub to try and bite her again, tightening her grip on her leash so she can wrench her away before she does too much damage with her teeth.</p><p>“If you bite me, pup, you’re seriously gonna regret it,” Rio warns her.</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha hums, scraping her incisors over Rio’s skin, making her chest tighten with burning <i>need</i>. “What’re you gonna do to me? Whip me? Gag me? Muzzle me? Like a wild animal?”</p><p>Rio smirks, and in what is probably an unwise and somewhat provocative move, tilts her head back, so that Agatha has more access to her throat, where she promptly begins to nibble and suck hickies.</p><p>“Did you know that the state of New Jersey runs a TNR animal program?” she whispers, her lips brushing against the shell of Agatha’s ear. “They capture the feral cats, the ones that are too wild to be tamed, the ones that <i>bite</i>. And you know what they do, Agatha, to feral animals that cannot be rehabilitated?”</p><p>“Put them down?” Agatha fires back, with a growl and a particularly sharp nip to Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“Oh, no, baby… not in the TNR program. The T, that stands for ‘trap’. The R is ‘release’. And the N? Well…” Rio chuckles, and quick as a whippet, thrusts her hand down between Agatha’s legs to seize hold of her clit between her thumb and forefinger, <i>crushing</i> it between them. “They neuter them.”</p><p>Agatha jerks and jolts on her lap with a strangled howl of pain, her head flying back and mouth departing from her skin. She scrambles to reach down with her cuffed hands and try to pry Rio’s hand away from her poor compressed little clit, which Rio gleefully tortures by pinching repeatedly, knowing that it will cause tidal waves of pain combined with intense pleasure rippling through Agatha’s body, turning her into <i>mush</i>.</p><p>“Are you gonna bite?” Rio challenges her.</p><p>“<i>NO!</i> NO, I won’t bite!” Agatha shrieks. “Stop!”</p><p>“Oh, does it hurt?” she tsks with fake sympathy. In reality, Rio’s sadist side is jumping up and down clapping with joy.</p><p>“<i>YES!</i>” Agatha keeps yanking at her wrist and then peers up with Rio with teary, pleading blue eyes. It’s an utterly intoxicating sight. “Rio,” she sobs.  “Sir, <i>please</i>.”</p><p>Rio takes pity on her, if only because she did have the manners to say please, and the fact that it actually, genuinely <i>hurt</i> like a dagger being thrust through her heart to hear her name being said by Agatha in that begging, desperate, agonized voice. She releases her clit, petting it gently to soothe her, and hugs Agatha as she collapses into her with a relieved gasp. She didn’t safeword, so it wasn’t anything she didn’t think she could handle, but it definitely hurt her.</p><p>Her sub hunches over a little bit as she curls into Rio’s body, instinctively seeking comfort and refuge in her arms, despite the fact that Rio is the one who just inflicted pain on her. Rio rubs her hand up and down her spine, cuddling Agatha’s naked form and delighting at seeing her in such a vulnerable and trusting state.</p><p>“You’re so gonna pay for that,” Agatha croaks, after a minute of silence where only her harsh breathing can be heard.</p><p>“And when exactly are you gonna seek revenge against me?” Rio laughs. “I’m the one in control.”</p><p>“When I dominate <i>you</i>,” Agatha replies firmly.</p><p>Rio clucks her tongue. She was wondering when Agatha might try and bring that up. “Hypothetically, you mean?”</p><p>“No, I said ‘when’, not ‘if’,” she huffs. “It’s gonna happen. You may not have agreed to it yet, but it’s gonna. I’ve drafted up a contract for us already.”</p><p>Rio falls silent, her hand halting on Agatha’s lower back. What? Agatha has written <i>Rio</i> a submission contract? She should be furious, but to be honest, she’s too shocked to be. Since Rio has only ever subbed for her romantic partners, they never had specific BDSM contracts. She’s only ever been on the other side of contracts - as in, the one passing it over to a sub client to fill out and sign.</p><p>It is, she realizes, a flagrant overstep on Agatha’s part. It crosses a major line, but Agatha has never really respected that line away, choosing instead to leave one toe behind it, whilst sauntering over to the other side to press Rio’s buttons.</p><p>“I warned you before not to bring it up again,” she says sternly. “I told you, I won’t be pressured into submitting.”</p><p>“You said you would think about it,” Agatha fires back, adjusting her position on Rio’s lap. It causes her thighs to rub up against the dom’s stockings, and she smooths her hands over her abs, as far as she can while they are cuffed. “I just thought - knowing that I would take it seriously, by writing a contract for you -”</p><p>“Agatha, we are in the middle of a scene. The middle of one of <i>your</i> sessions,” Rio cuts her off fiercely, jerking her leash. “We are not talking about this anymore. It’s entirely inappropriate and frankly, disrespectful to me as your dom. End of discussion.”</p><p>Agatha goes quiet. She ducks her head, leans forward and huddles closer to Rio as she presses her forehead against her clavicle. “Fine,” she mutters sulkily. “It’s just - you’re the first other BDSM switch I’ve ever met. I’ve never played with someone else who has bilateral experience when it comes to kink before.”</p><p>“And I commend your curiosity, but now is entirely the wrong time and place to have a conversation about it,” Rio answers calmly.  “We’ll talk some other time, okay?”</p><p>The truth is that Rio has not even started to allow herself to consider it, knowing that when she begins to think about the possibility of Agatha dominating her, she will rapidly spiral and it will <i>ruin</i> her ability to dom her. Because she <i>does</i> want to submit for Agatha. Perhaps too much. But right now, as much as she hates to admit it, she does not trust Agatha to act as a responsible dom for her.</p><p>She needs Agatha to show some improvement in her understanding of how subspace and aftercare function within scenes before Rio can trust her to take her of her while subbing. Giving control over her body to someone who pushed her into top drop the past week does not seem like a good idea to her right now, and until the red flags die down, Rio will not allow herself to contemplate the concept. Even though there is a tiny part of her brain that now constantly urges her to kneel when Agatha hits her with a particularly strict or annoyed look. She will not indulge the sub within her.</p><p>Agatha pouts. “‘Some other time’. Sure.”</p><p>“Now, now, don’t get petulant with me.” Trailing her fingers from her sub’s ass to her thighs, one hand braced against her stomach with her thumb strumming Agatha’s clit, Rio announces, “It’s pop quiz time. Let’s see if you can remember what the definition and symptoms of subspace are once your control over a future session and your punishment for the evening are on the line.”</p><p>It’s with grumbling reluctance that Agatha climbs off her lap, stomping her food impatiently as Rio shifts on the chair to get comfortable, sliding down slightly so that her strap is angled upright. When she gives a sharp tug on her leash to order Agatha to sit down, her sub bounds forwards enthusiastically, vaulting onto her lap and wiggling her hips.</p><p>She braces herself with her cuffed hands against the table, back arched to expose her moistened slit, which Rio thrusts two fingers into. Her thighs are slippery from her pussy having transformed into a swimming pool, Rio’s fingers sliding into her frictionlessly until her base knuckles are pressed to her perineum.</p><p>“You, my sweet puppy, are dripping. And you’ve got my cock all nice and slicked up, ready to just slip into you,” she croons.</p><p>Rio crooks her fingers and spreads them apart as Agatha’s cunt clenches down on them, slick coating her hand. Her pussy clasps at her fingers as she withdraws them, not wanting to release them. She plants one hand on Agatha’s ass, with the leash wrapped around it, and takes her strap into her hand with her other hand drenched in Agatha’s juices.</p><p>“Ready?”</p><p>Agatha releases a strained moan when she feels Rio gently nudge the head of her strap into her entrance, which pulses around it. “God, you really have to ask when I’m this wet for you?” she keens.</p><p>“Just checking,” she snickers.</p><p>She notches her strap and lifts her hips to push it fluidly inside of Agatha, using her other hand to guide her sub’s ass downwards by pulling on her leash as she does so. Agatha clenches her ass and chokes out a groan as her cunt sinks down the strap, pussy lips parting and stretching around the thick girth, swallowing in inch after inch.</p><p>Seven inches of strap is nothing to scoff at, and even though Agatha is wet and prepped, having had Rio’s fingers inside of her, it’s an effort for her to take the entire length all at once. Rio’s cock plunges inside of her like a knife through butter, and Agatha’s hot slick dribbles out of her onto Rio’s thighs as it is displaced, some of it even dripping through the harness into Rio’s pubic hair.</p><p>A hiss escapes Agatha’s lips when she finally, <i>finally</i>, drops the final inch down, her ass hitting the harness, legs sprawled out and open, resting on Rio’s thighs. Her feet dangle off the floor as she rests her whole weight on Rio’s lap, which forces the strap even deeper inside of her. She slowly sits upright, straightening her spine; her back comes into contact with Rio’s front, the dom’s breasts pressed up against her shoulder blades, as Rio winds her arms around her waist and locks her heads together to keep Agatha secured, the leash left to drape down her back.</p><p>The base of the strap is wedged up against Rio’s clit in this position; the constant pressure causes a pleasant fuzziness to wash over the dom’s mind. She probably won’t be able to come from this, but she’s not worried about that. Agatha could ride her right now, she thinks dazedly. She could use her body like she’s nothing more than a glorified dildo.</p><p>And then it strikes her that it’s probably not all that professional to be fantasizing about her submissive client dominating her in the middle of a scene, and that she shouldn’t be thinking about it <i>anyway</i>. Goddamn submissive instincts peeking out from within their lockbox and influencing her thoughts, when she is meant to be focusing on her job.</p><p>Rio nuzzles down on Agatha’s shoulder, murmuring, “Color?” as she subconsciously bucks her hips just a tiny bit, to scooch down the chair a little further so that she can get comfy.</p><p>The guttural sound that rips from Agatha’s throat as she bounces on Rio’s lap because of her movements is utterly unhinged. Her head drops and hangs, her nails digging into the dining table as she cries out shakily, “Fuck, don’t <i>move</i>, give me a minute. I’m green as the five thousand dollars I pay you for each session, and because of that you can give me a <i>minute</i> to adjust.”</p><p>Rio is so tempted to lunge upwards to jab the head of her strap into Agatha’s cervix just to hear that deranged, horny as fuck noise burst from her mouth again, but ultimately decides to give her time to get used to the feeling of being full to the brim with firm silicone.</p><p>She slides one of her hands down Agatha’s abdomen to her drenched curls, combing through them and pressing down on her pubic mound. She can feel a slight bulge from the strap inside of her, and it’s so insanely hot that Rio can’t help but twitch her hips, making Agatha moan.</p><p>“Is puppy feeling overwhelmed?” she laughs.</p><p>“Don’t patronize me,” Agatha mutters, still bent over with her cuffed wrists braced on the table. “It’s just been a while.”</p><p>She gingerly rocks back and forth, and even though Rio cannot feel what the sub’s pussy is doing around her strap, she can feel it through her fingertips, can feel Agatha’s abdomen muscles tensing and clenching around the intrusion. Rio’s fingertips dance lower, ghosting over the lawyer’s protruding slippery clit, prodding at where cold silicone enters Agatha’s ravenous entrance, her pussy lips spread deliciously wide.</p><p>It coaxes more of those beautiful garbled noises from her sub, who is now trembling, her whole body flushed. What Rio would give to be able to astral project and get a view of this from the front, seeing Agatha’s cunt stretched around the galaxy strap.</p><p>When Agatha fidgets yet again, with a quiet panting whimper, Rio raises the hand not currently focused on petting her clit like it’s a kitten to gather her hair from where it’s draped over her face like a shield. Hooking her fingers into Agatha’s collar, she tugs her back carefully, until she’s once again leaning back against Rio’s front, head tipped back against her shoulder.</p><p>“You comfortable?” she whispers.</p><p>“Thought the whole point was to make me <i>uncomfortable</i>,” Agatha gasps out in a husky voice. Her eyes flutter shut. “You’re so huge, <i>fuck</i>.”</p><p>It strokes Rio’s ego, hearing that, knowing that her choice of strap was perfect and that she read Agatha correctly as a size queen. “Yeah? You feel full, <i>bizcochito</i>? Bet I reach up to your cervix,” she breathes, rubbing over that spot on her sub’s mons where she can feel the swell of her strap. She lathes Agatha’s neck above her collar with her tongue, enjoying listening to her frantic puffs for air, murmuring, “Bet with a few hard thrusts I could fuck into your womb and fill you to bursting with my come.” Agatha full-on groans hearing that, grinding down. Rio’s hands fly to her hips to halt her, growling, “No moving. Good girls sit still when they take their exams, don’t they? You sit upright with your back straight, and you answer the questions.”</p><p>“You can’t seriously expect me to take a pop quiz like this,” Agatha complains, opening eye one to glare over at the table, where the exam sheets are waiting innocuously.</p><p>“Why not?” Rio taunts. She jerks her hips again, so her cock plunges deeper to bounce against the spongy tissue of her cervix, which makes her release a muffled bleat and squeeze her eyes shut once again. Her face is scrunched up, her mouth open in an adorable ‘O’ of shock and overstimulation. “Is it too much, pretty girl?” she coos.</p><p>“Can you just - fuck me first, and then I’ll do the exam?” Agatha proposes, and when the dom tuts admonishingly, she actually, in her desperation, resorts to pleading. “God, Rio, <i>please</i>, I’m gonna fucking explode. Can’t believe you’re making me cockwarm your strap before you actually fuck me.”</p><p>“So needy,” Rio chuckles. She returns to fondling Agatha’s clit, her palm cupping her cunt which is now so wet she can’t gain any purchase with her fingers. “My poor puppy’s in heat, isn’t she? Your pussy’s drooling, so desperate for a pounding. How about this, you finish your exam and behave the whole way through it, and <i>then</i> I’ll fuck you.”</p><p>“But I want you to fuck me <i>nowwwww</i>,” Agatha whinges, slapping her hands violently on the table in what can only be described as a hissy fit.</p><p>Not one to indulge or allow that bratty behavior, Rio clucks her tongue and gives her pussy and clit a scolding smack. It’s such an intense sensation that the sub seizes within her arms and very nearly topples off her lap completely, only managing to stay mounted on the dom’s strap because of how Rio winds her arm around her waist. Agatha continues to writhe for several more seconds, and the gush of fluids from below onto Rio’s legs makes her wonder, for a fleeting moment, if her sub just <i>came</i> from being spanked on her cunt.</p><p>“<i>Shittt,</i>” Agatha wheezes. “The fuck was that for!?”</p><p>“No whining. Good puppies don’t whine. Apologize,” Rio orders. Agatha resists, turning her head away dismissively, so Rio places her palm threatening her once again with a harsh strike to her clit. “Apologize, <i>now</i>.”</p><p>Agatha grinds her teeth together and then grits out, in a sickly sweet fake voice, “My esteemed apologies, <i>sir</i>, for my querulous tone.”</p><p>Rio snorts silently. Querulous, huh? Her sub’s such a comedian. “Pop quiz. Now,” she demands, nodding to the table.</p><p>Grumbling, Agatha struggles to sit up, reaching for the exam sheets begrudgingly as she succumbs to her fate. A mere heartbeat passes, though, before she questions, “Where’s the pen?”</p><p>Pen? She glances over Agatha’s shoulder and scours the table. There is no pen, or pencil, or any other writing instrument. Oops. Okay, so that’s on Rio. She meant to find one and place it on the table earlier, when she sent Agatha off upstairs to find the desecrated submission manual, but she got distracted thinking about her sub.</p><p>She rolls with the punches, replying bluntly, “Good students bring their own stationery to their exams. Better go get one.”</p><p>Agatha freezes. Glances over her shoulder, back at Rio, with an incredulous expression. “You can’t be serious.”</p><p>“No pen, no answers marked. Automatic fail.”</p><p>“Are you trying to kill me?” she accuses.</p><p>“My stage name’s not Lady Little Death for nothing,” Rio grins with a wink. She gives Agatha’s thigh a rough pat. “Go. And get your phone too, while you’re at it. I wanna take some pictures of my dumb little puppy’s cunt stuffed full of my cock. Oh, and a throw pillow from your couch, please.”</p><p>Agatha groans dramatically, but delicately extracts herself from Rio’s lap, rising off her strap with a wince. Come trails down her thighs as soon as the silicone cock pops out of her entrance, and when Agatha steps away, her knees are wobbly, and there’s a limp in her step. She casts a venomous look back at Rio.</p><p>The dom, who is bending down to pick up the discarded dog clicker from the floor and place it on the table, quirks an eyebrow, daring her to complain again. She will make Agatha pay for it later, and the sub knows it. Agatha sneers at her before hobbling away into the living room, leash trailing from her collar and the end dragging on the ground behind her.</p><p>Rio takes the opportunity to work herself up a bit, fingering some of the slick that Agatha has dripped all over her thighs and the strap harness into her own pussy beneath the base of the harness. She easily reaches a near peak just at the idea of shoveling Agatha’s come inside of her, moaning softly to herself as flashes of her previous fantasy, of riding Agatha like a bucking bronco, flit through her mind.</p><p>Agatha returns before she can bring herself to climax, pen clutched between her teeth, phone in one of her hands, and the pillow in the other. Her nostrils flare in indignation when she sees Rio touching herself, and it’s not hard to figure out that she’s affronted that <i>she</i> is not the one with her fingers inside the dom, when she wants to be.</p><p>She offers the pillow first, which Rio tosses onto the chair nearest to her for use later. She catches Agatha glowering at the pillow out of the corner of her eye, probably wondering why Rio didn’t bring it with them earlier so that she could kneel on it while sucking her strap, to avoid sore knees.</p><p>The phone is placed down on the table, next to the pop quiz papers, and the pen is dropped on top of them. Agatha shuffles forward and resumes her prior position on Rio’s lap, shaking from the anticipation of sinking down onto her strap again. It’s a much faster process, this time, mostly because of how wet Agatha is. She takes the entire silicone cock into her cunt in one downwards thrust.</p><p>Rio pulls on her thighs to spread them apart on top of her own, so that her strap-filled pussy is exposed fully to the air, before grabbing Agatha’s phone, eager to capture more photos that hopefully, she will not get caught staring at in a Whole Foods next time.</p><p>The lawyer’s passcode is the same as last time - 6969 - and Rio hastily switches the camera to selfie mode, angling it down so that Agatha’s stretched-out, dripping pink pussy and throbbing clit come into frame, the galaxy strap filling her glistening hole. Agatha makes no protest as she takes a couple of photos, even helping her by grasping it to get a better angle at one point.</p><p>“Send those to me tomorrow,” Rio purrs, sucking a hickey of thanks into her shoulder. “I wanna get them printed and framed. Put them up on my wall for me to admire and get hard looking at when I drink coffee and water my plants every morning.”</p><p>Agatha blushes furiously. “You’re ridiculous.”</p><p>“I just have an appreciation for fine art,” Rio hums into her skin. “And a dominant’s artistry is turning their submissive into a drippy, pathetic little puddle of a slut for their strap.” She lowers her voice to a throaty rumble, murmuring, “And I think my beautiful cockslut puppy is my masterwork.” Before she realizes what she’s doing, and without it fully registering, she presses a kiss to Agatha’s scapula, which makes her shiver. “Now take your test so we can move on and I can fuck your pretty pussy until you squirt over my strap.”</p><p>Agatha scrambles to pick up the pen and start reading over the paper, falling quiet. Rio leans back in her chair, closing her eyes. Her hands wander with minds of their own, rubbing Agatha’s hips, stroking over her stomach, occasionally slinking upwards to pluck at her perky nipples. The sounds of Agatha’s steady breathing and the scratch of a pen against paper are meditative and hypnotic, and Rio finds herself relaxing as she listens.</p><p>Minutes pass. The pen continues to scribble crosses in the boxes marking correct answers for the multiple-choice exam. Eventually, however, Agatha pauses, and the sounds of the pen stop. Instead, Rio hears aggravated, disgruntled sounds instead, and opens her eyes to see her sub frowning down at the exam paper, lips pursed.</p><p>“Stop huffing like an upset child and tell me what’s getting you so worked up,” she requests, propping her chin on Agatha’s shoulder so she can peer down at the test.</p><p>“Some of these questions are stupid!” Agatha protests, nose crinkling adorably. “I mean, ‘What is a top?’ ‘What is a bottom’? ‘What is a dom?’ ‘What is a sub?’” She throws the pen down in annoyance, pulling her hands into her chest. Rio has no doubt that if they weren’t cuffed, she would be crossing her arms angrily. “These are the absolute <i>basics</i> of not just BDSM but gay sex! Why am I being quizzed about them as if I’m <i>not</i> a lesbian in her early fifties who has known she is sapphic since puberty and been involved in kink since college?”</p><p>Rio laughs softly, reminding her, “A lot of people don’t know that there’s a difference between power and action.” Agatha tilts her head in reluctant acquiescence, picking the pen back up and starting to fill in answers again. Rio watches her mark the correct answers, heart bursting with pride with every single one that Agatha gets right, as she continues to explain absentmindly, “Domination and submission are about power exchange, about who calls the shots and who obeys in the dynamic. The dom controls and gives orders, the sub complies. Top and bottom are about physical sexual dynamics… who gives, and who receives. Usually referring to penetration, but sometimes to do with positioning as well, depending on who you ask. But it typically refers to the bottom, who receives and is penetrated, and the top who gives and is the penetrator.”</p><p>“Who you ask?” Agatha parrots, bemused. “Why is there confusion about that? Isn’t it obvious?”</p><p>“Not always. People often don’t know the difference between subbing and bottoming. You’d be shocked at how many lesbians I’ve come across who had no clue that power bottoms or submissive tops can exist. Don’t get me started on the huge debate on whether service tops are dominant or submissive - I would argue the latter. And then there are arguments about dom/sub switching vs top/bottom switching.”</p><p>Agatha bows her head, refocused on the exam again and scribbling answers, but she comments dryly, “I didn’t know there was such contention within the BDSM community.”</p><p>“... I wouldn’t say within the BDSM community,” Rio corrects. “More… people who are dipping their toes in or engaging in media portraying BDSM.”</p><p>Ten seconds of silence pass, with Agatha scratching out more boxes on the paper, and then she mutters under her breath, confessing, “Power bottoming is my favourite.”</p><p>Rio smirks. “I never would have guessed. Simultaneously holding all the power whilst getting maximum pleasure?” she teases. “I can see why it would appeal to you.” Agatha may be a switch, but she definitely gives off dominant vibes, and given how hungry she is for orgasms, it makes sense that she would enjoy domming from the bottom. She caresses Agatha’s waist, holding her in place as she carefully re-adjusts herself on the chair once again, jolting her strap inside of her sub’s silky cunt and triggering her to exhale sharply. “I bet you’re <i>such</i> a pillow princess.”</p><p>Agatha barks a laugh. “I’m not even going to dignify that with a response.” She shakes her head, rolling her eyes. “Me, a pillow princess. Pfff.”</p><p>Oh, Agatha would be a huge pillow princess, and now Rio wants to prove it to her. She’s absolutely certain in her assessment; Agatha would one hundred percent get off on lying back and relaxing in bed with Rio settled between her legs eating her out and concentrating on bringing her orgasm after orgasm.</p><p>“Answer your questions, Miss ‘highly experienced in BDSM’,” she prompts, when she sees that Agatha has paused on a specific question, tapping the end of the pen on the paper as she muses on what answer to pick. Agatha huffs unhappily and then selects three, marking crosses in all of the boxes. “Ah, it’s multiple choice, you only choose one answer.”</p><p>“But with some of these questions, multiple answers could apply!” she argues.</p><p>Rio is about to argue back that <i>she</i> wrote the exam, so she knows only one answer applies to each question, but then stops herself. Agatha seems adamant, and she doesn’t want to silence her sub when there is a chance that she’s critically thinking about the questions. “Explain.”</p><p>Agatha looks flustered for a second at being asked to justify herself, but then clears her throat, using the pen to point to the question. “Okay, well - ‘what is the purpose of aftercare?’ <i>Obviously</i> the answer is B, providing a period of time post-scene where the dominant and submissive can physically and emotionally recover together.” She moves the pen to tap at answers A and C. “But it also, <i>technically speaking</i>, can be A and C as well.” She sounds certain now, her voice confident. She glances back at Rio triumphantly.</p><p>Rio casts her gaze over the answers. She doesn’t agree, as she reads them over, but wants to hear Agatha’s reasoning, because maybe she’s missed something. “Elaborate?” she asks quietly.</p><p>Agatha nods, and as she speaks, it’s clear that she’s slipped into lawyer mode, walking Rio through her case. And it’s becoming blatantly obvious why she is one of the best in her field, because Rio listens to her absolutely riveted. “A, touching base with a submissive after a period of intense play, and C, a period of time whereby the dominant prepares the submissive for the scene. You and I both know that’s A is a safeword or color check, and C is foreplay, or ‘setting the stage’. But they also count as <i>pre-scene</i> and <i>mid-scene</i> ‘after’care, don’t they?” Agatha challenges, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“I’m not following,” Rio admits.</p><p>“You’ve done it with me in both sessions! Making sure that the submissive has eaten, and drunk enough water, and is physically and emotionally healthy enough to begin the scene. And then calling a time-out in the middle of a scene to check-in and reassure a submissive if the dominant is concerned about them. They’re all forms of aftercare.” She looks remarkably smug as she finishes explaining her logic, cocking her head to the side as if daring Rio to tell her that she’s wrong.</p><p>And Rio… well, she’s impressed. Because Agatha <i>is</i> technically correct. She’s never thought about the mid-scene check-ins and pauses as aftercare before, but they do <i>sort of</i> count, as they all contribute to the same purpose: ensuring the dom’s and sub’s physical and mental well-being are sound and secure.</p><p>“Holy shit, you’re actually trying super hard to ace this test,” she realizes aloud. Agatha is taking this completely seriously, not fucking around with her as she suspect she might, or fudging answers, or cheating. She’s completing the exam with sincerity. “You really did read the guide.”</p><p>“I gave you editing notes, of course I read it,” Agatha shoots back at her defensively. Rio wouldn’t exactly call what she did to the guide ‘editing’ it, when she’s left it covered in penis doodles in red pen, but maybe she should actually read the scribbles that Agatha has left in the page margins. “I didn’t graduate <i>summa cum laude</i> from Harvard, achieve my LL.M in only six months, and become a New York bar exam topnotcher, to get anything less than a one hundred on a fucking BDSM pop quiz.”</p><p>Okay, so Agatha might secretly be a genius. “Good girl,” Rio whispers, blinking at her slowly, like a big cat showing affection. Her hips spasm upwards, so that her strap jerks within her sub’s pussy.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks redden. She averts her eyes and her thighs tremble as she tries to squeeze them together, but Rio’s legs between them force them to remain parted. “Shut up.”</p><p>Picking up her leash, Rio slaps the handle end of it against Agatha’s slap to scold her. “You can pick multiple answers for the questions you think need them, so long as you write your reasoning in the margins.”</p><p>Agatha nods and begins picking out answers again. As she does so, Rio can’t resist teasing and playing with her a little especially after seeing Agatha’s face turn crimson after being praised. Her left hand tenderly plays with the sub’s left breast, while her right slips between her legs to pamper her pulsating clit, which has filled with blood from her arousal and so is ridiculously sensitive.</p><p>“You’re doing remarkably well working your way through this little exam for somebody with a seven-inch strap buried inside of your pussy,” she whispers. “You haven’t wiggled around once… but I can tell how affected you are.”</p><p>She pushes her forefinger tip at where Agatha’s cunt lips are spread around her cock, just about managing to pry it between them and curl upwards to the first knuckle. It’s so tight that she can feel Agatha’s hot walls practically strangling her fingertip, and she imagines that for Agatha it feels like a red hot firebrand breaking into her cunt.</p><p>Agatha immediately goes still, the pen falling from her hand as she places it flat on the table, inhaling briskly. “Rio,” she chokes.</p><p>“I can feel you clenching around me, milking my dick. So desperate to come, so desperate for <i>my</i> come,” Rio continues her dirty talk in a sultry purr, pressing her palm up against Agatha’s swollen nub. “My dirty puppy is so needy, she needs a long thorough fucking to calm her down, and you’ll take it, won’t you? You’ll take my cock like a good bitch.”</p><p>“Stop,” Agatha begs.</p><p>Stop is not her safeword. Her saying stop just eggs Rio on further. “Am I distracting you?” she asks innocently.</p><p>She knows that the answer is a categorical ‘yes’ without Agatha even needing to tell her. She’s being evil, playing around with her sub when she is meant to be concentrating on her exam, but she enjoys messing with her just as much as Agatha enjoys playing mind games with her.</p><p>“What if I do… this?” Rio pulls her hips back and then thrusts roughly upwards, plunging her strap into Agatha’s cunt at just the right angle to bruise her G-spot.</p><p>Clenching her jaw as she struggles to stay still, clearly wanting so badly to grind down on Rio’s strap, she grits out, “<i>Sir</i>, please, I am trying <i>very hard</i> to be a good girl for you and get full marks on this quiz.”</p><p>Rio grasps her hips firmly, no longer caring about the ‘warming’ part of her strapwarming plan. She wants to fuck Agatha. She wants her wailing and pleading and crying, begging to come around her cock. She pumps her hips again, and again, starting a slow but steady rhythm of shallowly thrusting up into her sub’s cunt, glancing off her cervix or G-sport, depending on the angle she hits.</p><p>Agatha looks utterly wrecked, breathing heavily as she desperately tries to pick up the pen with her shaking hands and finish off the quiz, eyes darting over the pages as she rapidly ticks off answers.</p><p>“Am I making it difficult for you to focus?” Rio mocks her.</p><p>“<i>Yes</i>,” Agatha moans, and the dom doesn’t know whether that’s in response to her question, or because Rio reaches around to pinch at her aching clit at the same time she buries her cock deep and circles her hips, rubbing the head of the strap around Agatha’s walls.</p><p>“Too bad,” she grunts, thrusting harder.</p><p>Ten slow, torturous thrusts later, Agatha throws the pen down on the table and declares, “Done.”</p><p>“Are you?” Rio halts in her movements, pulling her sub down onto her lap and smiling deviously when Agatha groans at the sudden pause. “Well, let’s mark it then and see what score you got.”</p><p>She goes through the questions quickly, checking what Agatha has crossed off for her answers, and with every question that Agatha gets correct, the pride in her chest grows stronger and brighter, until it’s a full-on bonfire, stoking her arousal.</p><p>“Would you look at that. My mischievous little slut is quite the teacher’s pet. Full marks.”</p><p>Agatha preens, beaming at her. She looks so fucking cute with those sweet little dimples and shining blue eyes. “Does this mean I qualify as co-writer for when you publish your guide to submission now?” she asks cheekily, rolling her hips from side to side to nestle Rio’s strap deeper into her cunt.</p><p>The dom snorts. “No. It’s my guide, and you defaced it -”</p><p>“- <i>Improved it</i> -” Agatha corrects.</p><p>“But you should know that I’m <i>very</i> proud of you,” Rio emphasizes.</p><p>The gorgeous blush that appears over Agatha’s face makes the entire ordeal worth it, but thank <i>fuck</i> the exam is finally over, because Rio has never wanted to fuck somebody so badly before. It only took about fifteen minutes, but it felt like <i>hours</i>. Rio is practically shaking with her desire to come.</p><p>Without giving any warning to Agatha, she stands, her arm caging in her sub’s torso to keep her back plastered to Rio’s front. She hooks her other hand into her collar, gripping her leash tightly to maintain control. Gasping, Agatha scrambles to react, forced to stand on her tiptoes as Rio’s silicone cock remains speared in her pussy. Her cuffed hands fly to grip onto Rio’s.</p><p>“Now I am going to be <i>very generous</i> and give you a little extra treat for being such an excellent student,” the dom murmurs, nibbling at the back of Agatha’s neck and collar, pulling on it with her teeth. “I want you to choose. Dining table, breakfast bar, or coffee table?”</p><p>“What for?” Agatha breathes, hissing when one of Rio’s hands drifts upwards to massage her breast.</p><p>Rio huffs a dark laugh. Does she really have to ask that question? “I think you know what for, sweet girl,” she whispers. “There’s no wrong answer. Just choose one.”</p><p>Agatha glances over at the breakfast bar and then the living room, and seems to decide that she can’t wait that long - or perhaps she suspects that if were to choose the bar or the coffee table, Rio would frogmarch her over with her strap still buried inside of her, torturing her with every step. She answers quickly, “Dining table.”</p><p>Oh thank god. Rio is already close, needing to move would be such a huge hassle. “Great choice, <i>bizcochito</i>,” she purrs.</p><p>Grabbing the pillow on the nearby chair that she asked Agatha to bring in earlier, she slips down to the middle of the table, to cushion Agatha’s head; she doesn’t want her whacking her head back against the hardwood and giving herself a concussion. Rio has spent hours debating what position to fuck Agatha in on top of a table, and has several options, but she ultimately wants to be able to look into Agatha’s eyes as she thrusts inside her, to see her creased open-mouthed expression of bliss.</p><p>Pulling her strap out of Agatha briefly - and she instantly begins to fuss, whining and trying to push her ass back in hopes of getting the cock to slip back inside of her - Rio swivels Agatha around with her hands on her hips, crowding her up against the table. Agatha stares at her with wide, shocked eyes as Rio scoops her up effortlessly and deposits her on her back on the table, her head landing on the pre-placed pillow.</p><p>Grasping Agatha’s thighs, Rio drags her down into her ass half-hangs off the table’s edge, pushing her legs up into the air. It gives her an absolutely fantastic view of her weeping velvet pink pussy; her entrance has been stretched open to form a tiny teardrop shape because of how long its spent accommodating Rio’s girth.</p><p>“Fuck,” she groans appreciatively. “You’re so fucking beautiful, Agatha.”</p><p>Although it's not in her plans, she can’t resist bending down to taste her again, licking eagerly over her slit to lap up her copious sweet juices, using her fingers to pry her hole open so she can fully stick her entire tongue inside. Agatha squeaks and jumps in surprise, reaching down with her handcuffed hands to try and claw at Rio’s hair, but she retaliates by pulling back, ending the stimulation so long as Agatha attempts to snag hold of her hair.</p><p>“How’s my good girl doing? How’s she feeling?” she pants, wiping her wet mouth on the back of her hand. Not wanting it to go to waste, she licks it up, humming happily. Agatha is delicious; she will never get tired of eating her out.</p><p>“Waiting for you to put your strap where your mouth was,” Agatha replies breathlessly, spreading her legs wide to show off her glistening slit. “You gonna fuck me or not? Because if you don’t, I will start screaming.”</p><p>“Screaming, huh?” Rio smirks. “I’ll show you ‘screaming’.”</p><p>Not having her strap inside of Agatha is driving her crazy, so she assumes her chosen position, dragging the head of her cock over Agatha’s swollen folds until she’s a whimpering thrashing mess. Growling, Rio thrusts in to the hilt and bottoms out in one long push, skewering her sub’s pussy and moaning at the firm pressure it puts on her clit. She throws Agatha’s right leg up and over her shoulder and pulls her left around her thigh, leaning forward as she winds her sub’s leash around her palm before wrapping that hand around her throat, just below her collar, to pin her down.</p><p>And then she goes to fucking town.</p><p>Rio jackknifes her hips forward to repeatedly plow the strap into Agatha’s pussy without abandon, each powerful thrust actually causing the whole table to move an inch across the floor, making a grating sound. Along with the sounds of the table screeching over the kitchen tiles, Agatha’s own wails shatter the air, her back arching as if she’s being pumped full of electricity. Rio plunges her strap into her over and over again.</p><p>When Agatha extends her trembling hands down, to try and rub at her own clit, Rio slaps them aside with a sharp bark of, “<i>No</i>, no touching. Your body is mine to play with, puppy, your clit is <i>mine</i>. Only I’m allowed to touch it.” She grabs at Agatha’s mons until she’s gripping it so tightly that it has to hurt. “You’re enjoying this, aren’t you, puppy? You love being my come-hungry bitch in heat, don’t you?”</p><p>“<i>Yes, yes, yes</i>,” Agatha chants.</p><p>“Say it!” she orders ferociously, spittle flying from her mouth. “Tell me who you belong to!”</p><p>Agatha is in <i>deep</i> subspace now. She’s gone all floppy and limp, simply allowing Rio to hammer into her cunt as she whimpers and whines, her messy mane of sweat-soaked hair halo-ing her head on the pillow. Her entire body is shaking. For someone who doesn’t think subspace is a real thing, it suits her well. Subspace looks magnificent on her, and Agatha is definitely enjoying it.</p><p>“I’m Rio Vidal’s bitch, I’m her pathetic submissive slut, I’m her whore,” she cries out, her head lolling as she is rocked back and forth on the table with each of the dom’s brutal slams into her abused cunt. “Fuck me, Rio, <i>please sir, please fuck my needy holes, sir</i>.”</p><p>Rio slaps her hand down onto Agatha’s breast, grinning at the yelp she releases and the bright pink outline of her hand that instant appears. Her cunt and ass clench instinctively at the pain; Rio feels her sub’s body tense beneath her palm as she kneads at the handprint mark to help the throbbing dissipate, pinching at her nipple teasingly.</p><p>After one vicious thrust that actually triggers Agatha to try and cover her face with her hands, Rio holds the strap deep within her, the head stabbed against her cervix, so she can swirl her hips and circles and stimulate herself.</p><p>She blacks out for a full ten seconds, stars appearing in her eyes, as several mini orgasms crash over her all at once. She nearly collapses on top of Agatha in exhaustion, but swallows back her euphoric moan, not wanting to drown out Agatha’s addicting feral passionate noises. She can’t stop now. She has a fucking job to do, and that job is fucking Agatha Harkness until she turns into literal putty on her strap.</p><p>“I’m not gonna stop until I break in your cervix and you’re crying for mercy,” Rio tells her hoarsely, her hand on Agatha’s throat tightening until she’s wheezing, mouth hanging open and eyes half-lidded.</p><p>“Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck. <i>Harder</i>,” her sub slurs. “Put your <i>fffffucking</i> back into it, sir.”</p><p>“God, Agatha, if I fuck you any harder I’m gonna snap your spine like spaghetti,” Rio snarls.</p><p>But she does <i>try</i>, hiking Agatha’s leg draped over her shoulder higher to open up her pussy more, so that now every time she thrusts, the harness base strikes not only her own clit, but Agatha’s as well, which makes her release a cry that very closely resembles the type a fox would make in the throes of passion.</p><p>“D-don’t let the Italians - <i>oh fuck oh fuck</i> - hear you say that. Sacrilege,” Agatha rasps.</p><p>“What the fuck are you talking about,” Rio mutters confusedly, too focused on her thrusting to spend a spare second digesting Agatha’s random ass statement.</p><p>“Snapping spaghetti, it’s a culinary faux pas. Like - <i>oh god yes there, that’s it</i> - s’like when you overcook pasta and don’t serve it al dente, it ruins the eating experience.”</p><p>The dom groans. “Why the hell are you thinking about <i>pasta</i> while I fuck you!?”</p><p>“You’re the one who brought it up in the first place!”</p><p>“Well I’m clearly not fucking you hard enough if you can still think and speak,” Rio determines.</p><p>“That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you!”</p><p>She speeds up, throwing her entire weight forward into each lunge, making sure she bottoms out every single time. The amount of slick that’s emerging from Agatha’s cunt with each thrust is <i>ungodly</i>, and is turning the table into a damn Slip-N’-Slide; she’s going to be seriously dehydrated later.</p><p>Agatha’s come is <i>everywhere</i>, and the musky smell of it has permeated the air so that Rio breathes it in with every desperate puff for oxygen, her head reeling. It’s driving her even crazier, so much so that she wonders if Agatha’s somehow secreting sex pheromones to trigger some sort of primal animal-like heat in her, that should have been long suppressed by evolution.</p><p>As her entire body is thrown back and forth on top of the table with each one of Rio’s insane deep penetrations, Agatha turns her head to the side and spits. The saliva that emerges is tinged red.</p><p>The sight of it instantly alarms Rio, who panics, stops mid-thrust, and splutters out, “Oh shit, are you okay?” Did Agatha damage her throat earlier when sucking her off?</p><p>Agatha struggles to lift her head, but when she manages to for a second, Rio sees that her eyes are cloudy from subspace. Her tongue darts out to wet her lips, which are stained crimson; the blood is from her biting her lip, not from her throat being injured. “<i>Sssstellar</i>,” she mumbles. “Ten out of ten, doing <i>fantasssstic</i>. Green green green green, s’my new favorite color, I fuckin’ love green, <i>fuck, fuck me, Rio, FUCKKKK.</i>”</p><p>She resumes, her hips pistoning forward so fast and with such force that Rio is truly testing her own stamina. The dom’s rapid thrusting pushes the base of the strap up against her now overstimulated throbbing clit, filling her body with intense heat and desire. Rio gets so lost in her own pleasure for a moment, almost dizzy with her desperate need to come again, that she almost misses Agatha tipping over the edge.</p><p>“Rio, oh god, <i>Rio</i>,” Agatha keens, her back arching and hips bucking wildly.</p><p>The lawyer’s legs begin to spasm and a sudden flood of ward liquid gushes down the front of Rio’s thighs as a strangled moan escapes Agatha’s mouth; it’s muted because of how her head has lolled to the side, but it’s a moan nonetheless, and not just any moan. It’s an <i>orgasm</i> moan.</p><p>Rio stills, her and Agatha’s pelvises pressed together as the strap fills her to the brim. Leaning forward, she fixes her gaze on Agatha’s face, which is crumpled in a <i>very</i> obvious expression of orgasmic ecstasy. And Rio almost missed it. How fucking <i>dare</i> she come without permission?! She cannot believe Agatha’s audacity - she didn’t even warn Rio that she was getting close!</p><p>“Did you just come?” she asks severely. “Did you just come without permission? Did you just steal an orgasm?”</p><p>Agatha cracks an eye open. She licks her lips slowly, which then stretch into a shit-eating grin. “Oops,” she leers.</p><p>Rio seethes. “You greedy fucking whore. You insatiable slut.”</p><p>She <i>was</i> going to allow Agatha to come - was going to make her come <i>multiple times</i>, in fact - but now? Now she’s decided that Agatha deserves to be edged into <i>oblivion</i> later on in the session when she’s planning to rail her again.</p><p>“<i>Your</i> insatiable slut,” Agatha croaks out, with a triumphant smirk. “You know, you didn’t specifically <i>say</i> I had to ask permission first today.”</p><p>Glowering at her, Rio debates what to do next. Agatha honestly needs some manners knocked into her. She’s been snarky and disrespectful despite all of Rio’s warnings that being rude will mean strikes get taken off her spanking tally. She’s considering just hogtying her, shutting her up with the chew toy gag, and leaving her in a time-out for the rest of the evening. But would that be a significant enough punishment? Would that teach her the lessons that she <i>needs</i> to learn?</p><p>No, Agatha needs to get spanked. She needs her ass struck until it’s red raw and blistered and she can’t walk straight. She needs to be disciplined, until she expresses true regret and apologizes. And it is Rio’s duty, as her dominant and her educator, to ensure that occurs.</p><p>Rio pulls her strap out of her fast, so quickly in fact that Agatha’s body seizes beneath her at the sudden hollow sensation. Stepping back, the dom yanks on her leash roughly, wrenching Agatha back and away from the table. Her legs give out from beneath her and she drops to the ground like a stone, on her hands and knees.</p><p>The riding crop that Rio has not needed to use for the past hour emerges from its holder ring on the side of her strap harness. She slaps the leather pad under Agatha’s chin, making her groan and raise her head. She stares up at Rio with a bleary-eyed scowl and a pout on her lips.</p><p>“You have no idea how many strikes I just took off your tally, but you’re about to find out,” Rio tells her darkly, her tone frigid. She tugs the leash upwards, so that the collar cuts into Agatha’s throat harshly. “It’s punishment time, puppy. Bedroom, now.” When Agatha tries to struggle to her feet, Rio kicks out, planting her stockings-covered foot on her shoulder and shoving her back down to the ground, saying furiously, “No. You crawl like a dog, like the desperate bratty bitch you are. Ungrateful puppy! I fucked you like the amazing, generous dom I am and you went and came without permission. Well good job, hope you enjoyed your sneaky little cummies - because you're not coming again tonight. And you’re gonna pay for the orgasm you stole when you go over my lap.”</p><p>Agatha juts her bottom lip out and challenges, “Bring it on then, big boy.”</p><p>She’s straining against her leash, remaining on all fours but growling, her eyes flashing dangerously. Her sweet little puppy from earlier is <i>gone</i>, and what’s left behind is the same feral beast that Rio had to wrestle into submission during their first session.</p><p>So that’s how she wants to play it, huh? Rio bares her teeth at her in a wolfish smile. Oh, she’ll play. She begins to literally <i>drag</i> Agatha across the floorboards towards the stairs, using sharp strikes of her crop to her sub’s ass to motivate her. The lawyer continues to snarl and rumble like an animal, fighting her leash, her blue eyes piercing.</p><p>Agatha has no clue what tumultuous world of pleasure mixed with pain she has just landed herself in. The only way to put a stop to it will be safewording - which Rio still suspects that Agatha is reluctant to do. She may have experienced paddling and spanking and even beatings before, at the hands of her doms, but she’s never had Rio be the one to administer corporal discipline before. Orgasm denial and a spanking will just be the start.</p><p>Rio plans to make it a night that Agatha will never forget.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Dragging a 5 foot 5, 135-pound woman up a staircase, by a leather leash attached to the collar wrapped around her neck, is a lot harder than Rio anticipates. Especially considering that she is resisting and acting like a wild animal the whole time.</p><p>Agatha’s hands are cuffed in front of her, and her legs remain untied, meaning that she is able to latch on to the staircase railing and anchor herself at the bottom; she plants her feet firmly and snarls whenever Rio tries to pry her hands off, bursting into hysterical laughter when Rio ends up resorting to getting behind Agatha and using her crop to motivate her.</p><p>Of course, being the sneaky, bratty menace that she is, Agatha immediately takes off up the stairs on all fours like some feral, gangly creature. She’s so fast that she wrenches the leash out of Rio’s grasp, causing her to nearly stumble from losing her balance.</p><p>“Catch me if you can, <i>sir</i>,” she sneers with a wicked cackle, vanishing into her bedroom.</p><p>Rio watches on in irritation and faint amusement, shaking her head with a heavy sigh. She mentally deducts yet another strike from Agatha’s tally for being an unruly nuisance. “It’s not a matter of <i>if</i>, Agatha, it’s a matter of when and how,” she calls up to her. “We can do this the easy way or the hard way. Easy way, you’ll already be kneeling on the mattress when I join you. Hard way…” She huffs a laugh. “What am I saying? You’ll pick the hard way. You always pick the hard way.”</p><p>Making sure she’s picked up the clicker from before and also the handcuff key, Rio grabs her backpack, slinging it over her shoulder as she follows her sub up the stairs. The bag is stuffed to the brim with play equipment and also stuff for aftercare, since Agatha will likely need more specialized care after her spanking. Fortunately, Rio packed her favorite toys for edging her subs just in case, which she is now very excited to use.</p><p>Right now, however, she needs to focus on the punishment section of their session first. It’s her job as Agatha’s dom to discipline her as she sees fit, but she has to try and remain as objective as possible and keep in mind that Agatha is highly unlikely not to speak out or safeword if her the pain reaches the point of intolerable, so she needs to pay close attention to her body language. The line between pleasure and agony is a very thin one for masochists like Agatha, and therefore very easily accidentally violated.</p><p>When she reaches the top of the stairs, just outside of Agatha’s bedroom door, Rio pauses, bowing her head and listening for any hint of Agatha’s movements. The door is half closed and obscuring her view into the room.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Agatha is waiting to ambush her inside, getting ready to pounce on her. Rio is tempted to let her, if only because it will give her the delightful opportunity to wrestle and pin her to the floor, forcing her into submission.</p><p>“<i>Ag-a-tha</i>,” Rio croons, using a mocking sing-song tone as she clucks her tongue like she would if calling over a misbehaving pet. “I’m not stupid, you can’t trick me into walking into a little trap. I know you’re gonna jump out at me. That isn’t gonna end how you want it to, puppy.”</p><p>Agatha stays silent in response. Alright then. If that’s how she wants to play it.</p><p>Rio tosses her backpack into the room first, since it doesn’t have anything particularly fragile in it tonight, and grins when she hears Agatha’s barely audible yelp of shock at the sound of it thumping loudly onto the floorboards.</p><p>Squinting through the tiny gap between the door and its frame allows Rio a glimpse of the top of Agatha’s head, although it is difficult to pick out her messy dark hair from the bed’s black sheets. She has her pinpointed now, hunched down on the opposite side of the bed in a position that is not dissimilar to one a hunting big cat would adopt.</p><p>Then, she kicks the door open. Agatha is obviously expecting her to rush in, because she leaps out from behind the bed, clasping onto a throw blanket with her cuffed hands, which she must have planned to use to help subdue Rio. She emits the cutest little noise of bafflement and drops the blanket to the floor when no Rio appears, which is the perfect time for her to actually enter. Once Agatha is exposed and out in the open, Rio launches her counterattack.</p><p>Moving swiftly, Rio darts inside the bedroom, so that before Agatha even has the chance to react to her sudden appearance, she’s rugby tackling her onto the bed. The backs of Agatha’s knees hit the mattress, and Rio shoves her back onto it, crowding her. Her hips sink between her spread thighs, pushing their pelvises together and squashing the strap she’s wearing, which is still slippery with Agatha’s own slick, up against her sub’s bare belly. Grabbing the lawyer’s cuffed hands, the dom pins them to the bed above her head.</p><p>Winded, Agatha stares up at Rio with wide, sparkling blue eyes, her hair fanned out behind her like a glorious halo. She looks like an angel, a very light sheen of sweat covering her beautiful, flushed body. Hickies and tiny red marks from Rio’s crop decorate her skin like a work of art. <i>Rio’s</i> work of art, a masterpiece, painted by her mouth and tongue and fingers.</p><p>“Hi,” she says, mesmerized by the lawyer’s eyes.</p><p>Agatha snorts a laugh. “Hi,” she parrots back.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio says <i>yet again</i>, repeating herself like a speechless idiot, because holy fuck, Agatha is utterly gorgeous and her brain is not functioning properly because of it. This isn’t gay panic, this is gay freeze response.</p><p>She is overcome with the urge to kiss Agatha, as she has many times during this session already. She could, Rio realizes. And she thinks that Agatha would probably enjoy it, would trace her upper lip with the tip of her tongue, and open her mouth pliantly with a needy moan. Rio wants to kiss her, wants to hear the sounds she would make, wants to see how she could make Agatha squirm in pleasure.</p><p>There’s a tiny, whiny voice in the back of her mind egging her on, insisting, <i>what harm would it do? You want it, you’re certain she wants it too. Go for it, shoot your shot.</i> But no, Rio won’t. She can’t. She has to remain professional… and on top of that, it would be entirely inappropriate for her to kiss Agatha and invoke an immensely emotional situation between them directly before a punishment.</p><p>So instead, Rio busies her mouth by leaning down to suck in the hardened nipple of her sub’s right breast, scraping her teeth over it gently. Agatha whimpers, her legs twitching from where they’re wrapped around Rio’s waist; she grinds up against Rio’s strap, rubbing her clit and cunt on the galaxy silicone and coating it with fresh slick.</p><p>Releasing her stiff nipple with a ‘pop’, which has been worked pink by her lips, Rio smiles at her in triumph. She wraps Agatha’s leash around her hand and gives it a firm tug. “Caught you,” Rio says breathlessly.</p><p>“Only ‘cus I let you,” Agatha replies haughtily, her eyes black with desire. “You enjoy the chase, don’t you? Maybe we should explore some predator-prey stuff in the future. Ever played naked hide-and-seek in the dark? It’s a titillating experience.”</p><p>“Why am I not surprised that you <i>have</i> played that game?” Rio chuckles. She lets go of Agatha’s hands and settles back until she’s kneeling on the edge of the bed, Agatha’s legs falling to either side of her knees. “You know I deducted a strike for running away.”</p><p>“My destination was the same as where you wanted me to go,” Agatha pouts dramatically. “Shouldn’t I be rewarded for my speediness getting here?”</p><p>Rio tuts, flicking her on the breast. “Not when you yanked your leash out of my hand in the process. Puppies get reprimanded for disobeying their owners.”</p><p>Agatha smiles at her sweetly. “Isn’t the saying that there are no bad dogs, just bad owners? That means my disobedience is technically your fault.”</p><p>“Oh, by the end of tonight, that disobedience will have been trained out of you,” Rio says with a dark grin.</p><p>“Can’t teach an old dog new tricks, Rio.” The lawyer licks her lips hungrily, like a shark sending blood. “If you think just some leash yanking, spanking, and stern words are gonna flick a switch and transform me into some meek little docile sub, who will jump without asking how high and bark on command, you really have no clue what you’re doing. Or who you’re dealing with.”</p><p>“I don’t need any of that.” She slips her hand down, following Agatha’s happy trail down into her soft downy curls, until she’s tracing infinity symbols around her clit. Agatha’s legs tremble, her knees squeezing around the dom’s outer thighs. “If I can make this pussy purr with just a twitch of my fingers, then you can bet I’ll have my puppy begging and humping at my leg like a pathetic slut by the end of this scene.”</p><p>Agatha stares at her with hooded eyes, her eyes stormy blue, her mouth slightly open. “Call me pathetic again, and you’ll definitely need to get a tetanus shot after this session.”</p><p>“Hm. Maybe pathetic isn’t the right word. <i>Needy</i>, is more accurate. You want more than my fingers, don’t you? You want my lips wrapped around your clit, my tongue fucking your empty hole.” Rio thrusts forward, to rub her strap up against Agatha’s belly. “You want my cock stretching you out, filling you to the brim.”</p><p>An inhuman, animalistic sound rips from Agatha’s throat. “More,” she rasps.</p><p>“More? You want more than that? Greedy girl. How about my fingers in your ass too? Maybe a nice big plug to stuff you there and another in your mouth to shut you up, keep all three of your holes occupied.”</p><p>She feels hot all over, her head swimming with unbridled lust; Rio has to physically restrain herself from lifting Agatha’s hips and impaling her on her strap, forcing her to ride her. Not the time, not the time.</p><p>“You want my cum inside you too, Agatha?" she says hoarsely. “I’ll finger it inside you, get it as deep as possible. You’d like that, wouldn’t you?”</p><p>“Yes yes yes,” Agatha keens, rocking her hips back and forth frantically, her breathing picking up as she gets closer and closer to orgasm.</p><p>Fuck, so she has a cum kink as well. That’ll be something to play with later. Rio nearly comes on the spot at the idea of pumping Agatha full of the cum lube she keeps on hand for clients with breeding kinks, locking it into place with a vaginal plug, and making her walk around with it inside of her the next day.</p><p>But Agatha is getting way too close to orgasm again, and considering she already came once, without permission, she is not allowed to again for the rest of the session. Rio withdraws her fingers, grasps her by the waist, and slides her away, to remove all stimulation. “Nope. Poorly behaved puppies don’t get treats, they get disciplined.”</p><p>Agatha cries out in ferocious protest. “Bitch,” she seethes, glowering at Rio as she smears the sub’s slick over her belly to clean her fingers, using her like a tissue.</p><p>“Yes, you are. My bitch, in fact.” Rio takes the leather handle of Agatha’s leash and offers it to her by brushing it over her lips, until she obediently opens her mouth and delicately holds it between her teeth. “Hold your leash for me while I get everything ready for your punishment. <i>Don’t</i> bite down on it - if there are any teeth indentations when I remove it in a minute, your cunt’s getting slapped.”</p><p>She stands, and begins preparations for Agatha’s spanking, which does involve removing her strap from the ‘O’ ring on her harness, much to her disappointment. Agatha also looks as if she’s mourning the loss of it as she struggles to roll over onto her side so she can then sit up cross-legged, her cuffed hands resting in her lap and carrying the leash handle in her mouth like a dog carries a bone.</p><p>Her sub’s eyes track the galaxy-patterned silicone cock ravenously, as Rio places it on a bed of tissues, to wash in the bathroom later before using it again. She looks as if she desperately wants to lunge forward, snatch it, and shove it back inside of her, not caring that it’s no longer attached to its bearer. Maybe Rio will make her masturbate with it later during one of her edges.</p><p>Rio doesn’t take off her harness, but digs around in her backpack to pull out an anti-slip TPE pad, repurposed and cut to size from a yoga mat. This is a new one, not used for any other clients before. Rio knows that Agatha would throw a fit otherwise. It’s just large enough to drape over her thighs so that her subs, when bent over and lying on her lap for their spankings, don’t go flying off with the force of her hits.</p><p>Subs also find it a little more difficult to wriggle around on the mat without ultimately causing some chafing, so it tends to incentivize them to stay still. The mat is also padded enough that her harness won’t rub up against their intimates too roughly, and adds an additional level of punishment, as her subs don’t get to enjoy the sensation of skin-on-skin contact apart from when Rio brings her hand down on their asses. When she glances back over at Agatha to check on her, she's spat her leash out and has narrowed her eyes at her.</p><p>“Is pilates another method of punishment you like to use?” Agatha asks snarkily, as Rio unrolls the pad so that it flattens out, and won’t curl up on itself later. “Understandable, I mean it is physical torture in the form of a workout where you pay some twenty-year-old college dropout to instruct you how to twist yourself into a pretzel as they bark at you to ‘become one with your body’.” She narrows her eyes suspiciously. “I’m warning you now, if at any point you start ordering me to ‘activate my core’ and ‘engage my kegels’, I will bite you so hard you will <i>actually</i> need stitches this time.”</p><p>“No, I do not force my subs to do pilates or yoga as a form of punishment,” Rio snickers. “Although some of the best sex positions do benefit from the flexibility that practicing pilates allows.” She pauses, and then adds with a salacious wink, “And you engage your kegels just fine.”</p><p>Agatha has already proven her pelvic floor to be remarkably strong, given how tightly she’s able to clench her cunt around Rio’s fingers and strap.</p><p>Agatha blushes prettily, but tries to outwardly react with nonchalance. “Oh, I do exercises. I should show you sometime.” Wiggling her eyebrows, she suggests, “And maybe you can show me some of those flexible sex positions. You know, preferably <i>with</i> me. I’ve always been interested in trying out the Bermuda triangle, it’s meant to be even more intense than a 69. And the butler position. Ooh, and flying squirrel, although I think I would prefer to top for that one -”</p><p>“Hey, sweetheart, focus up.” Rio clicks her fingers. Damn, Agatha is far too easily distracted, and when her ADHD is paired with her inherent and Adderall-amplified high libido? Deadly combination. “We’re not gonna be trying out anything if you don’t submit to your punishment.”</p><p>Agatha raises her chin with a disdainful scoff. “I’m submitting, <i>sir</i>, I’m just waiting for you to be ready.”</p><p>“I’d be ready by now if I didn’t have to keep wrangling <i>you</i> when you get distracted. By sex positions, of all things.”</p><p>“Don’t diss my special interest.”</p><p>Rio blinks. “Your special interest is sex positions?” She doesn’t know why she’s surprised. That is perfectly in line with Agatha’s personality. She probably has a system to rank them all by difficulty and a scale for top vs bottom enjoyment.</p><p>“Sex in general,” Agatha shrugs. “I also have every single United States legislative code number, and what law they represent, memorized. I like the organization of the numbers. And yes, it’s also so I know precisely which laws to exploit to get my clients less time in jail, and why I’m the best lawyer in the state.” She grins viciously, her smile all teeth. “I also collect rabbit figurines.”</p><p>That seems… remarkably innocent. She thought Agatha was about to say rabbit vibrators. “Why rabbits?”</p><p>“They’re a symbol of fertility, balance, and rebirth in Germanic and Celtic Paganism. Probably because they breed like crazy. Symbolic of the Spring goddess Ēostre and the festival of Ostara - celebrating the Spring Equinox - which is where the Christians basically stole the name Easter from. Largely associated with the moon, and with witchcraft too.” Sticking her tongue out the side of her mouth adorably, she tags on, “Plus, they’re cute.”</p><p><i>You’re cute</i>, is what Rio instinctively is about to respond with, which fortunately, her brain-to-mouth filter kicks in just in time to prevent leaving her lips.</p><p>She nods, instead. “Guess they are pretty sweet.” But then she stops, bewilderment taking over. “Why the fuck are we talking about rabbits when I’m meant to be prepping to blister your ass?” She narrows her eyes when Agatha puts on an innocent, clueless expression. “Are you trying to distract me on purpose to delay your punishment?”</p><p>“Who, me?” Agatha points at herself, then glances over her shoulder theatrically. “No idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes and returns her attention to her prep work. A pair of leather gloves, deep hunter green, emerge from Rio’s backpack next - also bought new. She does prefer to smack her subs’ bottoms with a bare hand, but the cool, smooth leather can make for a wonderful sensation when applied to sore, reddened, sensitive skin.</p><p>“Will you finger-fuck me with those on later?” Agatha speaks up, her voice a shaky whisper as her gaze zeroes in on the gloves.</p><p>Rio pauses, contemplating. She didn’t intend to. “Would you like that?”</p><p>She’s fucked subs using her fingers while wearing latex medical gloves before, for a variety of reasons, but she can’t recall any instance where she finger-fucked them wearing a leather glove. Rio’s not sure she would classify herself as having any particular fabric-related kink; she’s enjoyed working with latex, silk, lace, and leather all before, when clients have requested them, but she does think that leather might be her favorite to wield, while lace is her favorite to wear.</p><p>The lawyer licks her lips. “Would I be asking if I wouldn’t?”</p><p>Given that leather is a natural, porous material, it quickly and easily absorbs liquid, dirt, and bacteria, so it has to be regularly cleaned and sanitized. Using leather inside of Agatha’s pussy might not be the best idea, but Rio is fairly certain that the gloves are clean, as she washed and dried them last night.</p><p>“We’ll see how well you tolerate your punishment first,” she decides. Actually, maybe she’ll finger her with them on <i>during</i> her punishment.</p><p>Agatha continues to watch on as Rio draws out more play items, including her chew toy gag, nipple clamps, and, unbeknownst to Agatha, her vibrating clit clip for triggering overstimulation. That’s going to be her wild card for later. There’s a dressing table directly across the other side of the room from the end of the bed, and Rio lays them all out in a line for easy pickings later.</p><p>“How many strikes am I gonna get?” Agatha wonders aloud.</p><p>Rio does the mental math, peering over her shoulder at her sub with a raised eyebrow. She knows the number she is about to say is going to light a fuse and cause a temper tantrum. “Fifteen.”</p><p>And, as predicted, Agatha immediately flies off the handle. “<i>FIFTEEN!?</i> WHAT?” she squawks furiously. She practically launches herself off the bed, nearly tripping over herself as she charges towards the dom, likely intending to shove her. She screeches to a halt when Rio reacts as if she’s in a Western shoot-out, wheeling around and whipping out her crop to press the popper into the hollow of her throat with a low warning noise. “I started with <i>thirty</i>, you deducted HALF of my strikes just because I came without permission!?”</p><p>Trailing the end of the crop up Agatha’s neck to tap it against her flushed cheek, Rio admonishes her, “No, I deducted half of your strikes for a variety of reasons, including vandalism, backtalk, disobedience, ignoring commands, fighting your leash, running off, feigning ignorance, foul language -”</p><p>“You swear more than me!” Agatha interrupts fiercely.</p><p>“ - <i>AND</i> stealing an orgasm,” Rio finishes, raising her voice to talk over her sub and slapping the crop’s pad against her cheek again chidingly. Agatha simply glares at her, seething.  “Are you going to argue with me?” she challenges.</p><p>“If I argue with you, are you gonna take more strikes?” Agatha fires back, rocking back on her heels and quirking an eyebrow. She turns her head minutely and snaps her teeth at the crop playfully.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The lawyer snorts and leers, “Tyrant.”</p><p>Well, if she’s going to act like that… “Twelve strikes,” Rio says blithely. When her sub’s jaw drops and face scrunches up in anger, and she’s just about to retort with some cutting remark, the dom cuts her off, tipping her chin up with her crop. “You wanna make it ten?” Her sub growls furiously. “Keep that up and I’ll knock it down to five.” If Agatha wants to keep mouthing off and run her total down to zero, Rio isn’t going to stop her. She gets to make her whine and squirm either way. “Apologize.”</p><p>Gritting her teeth, Agatha’s gaze is penetrating, those flecks of green and hazel in her blue eyes glittering. She appears to deliberate for a few seconds, the microexpressions flitting over her face extremely telling as to her conflicted state of mind. Rio can read her like a book; she’s as transparent as glass when she is frustrated like this. She wants to act like a little brat, kicking and screaming and disobeying every order Rio gives her. But she wants to experience a proper spanking administered by her dom more. There is some submissive instinct within her, that makes her want to be put over Rio’s lap.</p><p>That is the desire that wins out in the end, as she bites out a reluctant, “Sorry.”</p><p>Rio grins. “Good girl,” she praises. Agatha’s cheeks redden. Withdrawing her crop and sliding it back into her holder ring on her harness, she thumbs at Agatha’s cheek affectionately before ordering, “Sit.”</p><p>Agatha purses her lips but backs up towards the bed, to take a seat. But Rio tsks and yanks on her leash, pulling her back towards her with a hiss. She kicks her sub’s shins gently, and snaps her fingers at the ground, at the foot of the bed.</p><p>“I said, <i>sit</i>, puppy.”</p><p>“On the floor?” she complains in disgust.</p><p>“It’s a privilege for dogs to sit and lie on the bed. One you haven’t earned yet. SIT.”</p><p>Agatha sighs loudly, but doesn’t give as much attitude as before, as she slowly and carefully lowers herself to the ground, tucking her legs beneath her. Rio coils her leash around one of the bed’s legs, securing it with a knot. Agatha could easily free herself, even with cuffed hands, but this is going to function as a test.</p><p>“Stay,” she commands firmly.</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Agatha mutters, leaning her head against the mattress with yet another dramatic sigh. When Rio begins to walk away, however, she shoots upright, looking concerned and slightly alarmed. “Where are you going?”</p><p>“Your bathroom,” Rio tells her, but seeing the anxiety on Agatha’s face makes her stop mid-stride.</p><p>Oh, she remembers now; Agatha has had doms abandon her in the middle of their scenes before because they didn’t like that they had to work to get her to submit to her, thought and told her that she was a <i>bad sub</i>, and so gave up on her. She’s panicking because she’s scared Rio is about to do the same. She idly wonders if Agatha possesses rejection sensitive dysphoria, which is associated with ADHD, whereby she reacts intensely and experiences severe emotional distress because of perceived failure or rejection.</p><p>Returning to her side quickly, Rio kneels in front of her, cupping Agatha’s cheek and then raising her cuffed hands, to kiss her knuckles in an offer of comfort.</p><p>“I’ll only be a minute. I just need to wash up quickly,” she assures her sub quietly. “I’ll leave the door open the whole time. I’m not walking out on you mid-session, I promise. Definitely not after leashing you to your own bed.”</p><p>Agatha turns away, curling her lip. “I know that,” she says in a disgruntled tone. But she does appear to relax some, resting her head against the mattress again.</p><p>Rio flips her hands over to kiss her palms daintily, and then raises to her feet, making the <i>I’m watching you</i> gesture before departing into the bathroom. She picks up her strap from the dressing table as she passes by it. Taking a moment once she is inside to breathe, Rio stares at herself in the mirror. She’s flushed from head to toe just like Agatha is, but she looks a lot more put together, her hair less messy and skin unmarked, as of yet.</p><p>Rio’s thighs are sticky, both her own and Agatha’s cum drying on them; there are some washcloths on the counter, so Rio takes one and dampens it with warm water to wipe herself down, tossing it into the little basket for dirty towels in the corner once she’s done.</p><p>Washing her hands and her strap with the hand soap next to the sink, and then rinsing them all thoroughly for good measure - it’s a bad idea to get soap inside of somebody’s vagina - Rio listens for any sounds of movement from Agatha. She’s definitely doing something, because she can hear her hushed gasping breaths and hums. Touching herself, probably.</p><p>Rio smiles wolfishly. Agatha, trying desperately to get herself off in secret, because she knows that her dom will not allow her to orgasm later, is too good an opportunity to pass up walking in on. She therefore attempts to stay as quiet as possible as she finishes up in the bathroom, placing her strap on the counter to air dry, as she doesn’t want any loose towel fibers getting stuck to it.</p><p>She then creeps out on her tiptoes so as not to alert her sub to her approach. Unfortunately, the door creaks as she accidentally knocks her shoulder against it, and she winces in disappointment as she hears Agatha’s breath catch.</p><p>There’s a look of pure innocence plastered on the lawyer’s face when Rio emerges from the bathroom, her hands curled into fists to hide her fingers and artfully placed on top of her knees. But the mischievous twinkle in her eyes, as well as the way she is pressing her thighs together, gives away that she has been up to no good.</p><p>Rio crouches to stroke over her hair like one would pet an elegant feline, and Agatha even purrs like a cat, closing her eyes as Rio rakes her fingers through her dark brunette tresses. “Good girl for your sit-stay,” she praises her.</p><p>And then, just when Agatha has let her guard down and smiles, thinking that she’s got away with it, Rio strikes, seizing her cuffed hands. Grasping the handcuff chain, she tugs her hands upward. Agatha doesn’t even bother to resist, just pouting adorably. Rio uses her other hand to pry her sub’s fists open. Agatha’s fingers are wet, and a subtle sniff of them reveals that they smell just like her pussy.</p><p>“Did you touch yourself, Agatha?” Rio says, shaking her head in lighthearted disapproval. “Naughty, naughty.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha replies, and then laughs because of how obvious a lie it is.</p><p>“Your drippy little fingers say otherwise,” Rio teases.</p><p>She bends her head, to envelop her fore- and middle fingers in her mouth, with light suction. Lashing her tongue between the two fingers, she savours the salty, sweet, musky taste that is <i>Agatha</i> on her palate.</p><p>Agatha watches her with eyes that are on the verge of being totally black, because of how dilated her pupils are, and bites her lip to suppress a moan. Wanting to hear one escape, Rio grasps her sub’s wrist to hold it steady and bobs her head up and down, her lips sliding back and forth on Agatha’s slim digits, as if she’s blowing them.</p><p>“<i>Shit</i>,” erupts from Agatha in a barely audible whisper.</p><p>Rio releases her fingers from her mouth to scold her, “Language,” before taking hold of Agatha’s hand firmly and forcing it between Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>When her sub realizes what she’s doing, she leans back against the bed to spread them eagerly. Rio emits a noise of faux sympathy as she uses Agatha’s own fingers as an extension of her own hand to trace figure-eights over the lawyer’s prominent, red, throbbing clit; Agatha’s belly muscles tense as the dom guides her into dipping her fingertips into her weeping puffy hole, but never allows her to push in further than an inch or so before tugging her hand back.</p><p>“Is puppy’s little pussy feeling all hot and bothered after I teased you earlier?” Rio murmurs. “Is that why you couldn’t keep your hands to yourself, sweetheart? Is your clit still feeling tingly, even after you stole an orgasm? My needy pup wants to be fucked again, doesn’t she? She wants me to play with her hungry drooling cunt.”</p><p>A strangled mewl is forced from Agatha’s lips and she screws her eyes closed in pleasure as Rio pushes on the back of her hand so three of her own fingers are fed inside of her, cum easing the way. Once Agatha’s fingers are pushed inside of her to the hilt, she taps her hand to silently instruct her not to move them, to simply keep them still and fill herself up.</p><p>“Keep yourself stretched out for me, baby,” she husks.</p><p>“Too lazy to do it yourself?” Agatha says curtly.</p><p>“Hmm, my attention is better focused elsewhere,” Rio hums, eyes flitting to her new target to torture.</p><p>She uses her fingertips to push up Agatha’s clitoral hood to better expose the tiny raw pink pearl. Smirking, she grips onto it with those fingertips and rolls her sub’s clit in between them, as if she’s trying to milk it. Agatha reacts like she's being electrocuted. Her back arches, thrusting her breasts out, and her head tips back in a tremulous moan; Rio can see her pussy clenching wildly around her sub’s fingers.</p><p>Judging by Agatha’s panting breaths and the way her thighs are twitching, she’s very close to coming again. And just for that reason… Rio pulls back her hand, and grasps onto Agatha’s to yank her fingers out of her pussy as well. Agatha snarls at the loss, glancing up at Rio with betrayal glimmering in her eyes.</p><p>“<i>AGAIN?</i> Why?” she demands in a whine.</p><p>“You remember what I said. You came without permission earlier, so no more orgasms for you tonight,” Rio reminds her.</p><p>“Then why do you keep bringing me to the edge over and over!?” she says, frustrated.</p><p>Rio leans in and whispers, with a sadistic smile, “Because I like to see the way you shiver in disappointment when you’re denied.”</p><p>She unties her sub’s leash from the leg of the bed and tugs on it, so that the pressure of her collar cinching around her neck encourages Agatha to stand alongside her as she rises to her feet. Agatha does not, however, stand. She does clamber up onto her knees, using her cuffed hands to brace her, but then she stalls, scowling at Rio with an insolent pout.</p><p>“You’re mean,” she says simply.</p><p>“And you’re a brat,” Rio responds matter-of-factly.</p><p>Agatha sniffs. “You like that I’m a brat, though. Admit it.”</p><p>“I do. Because it means I get to punish you,” Rio grins. She offers Agatha her hand, her fingers damp with her juices, which she drags over her upper lip as she grazes them across her cheeks. “Don’t wanna waste any more perfectly good cum or get the sheets even dirtier than they need to be. Be a good puppy and clean up your mess. No sucking, just licking.”</p><p>Agatha attacks her fingers with enthusiasm, kitten-licking them clean, her hot, wet tongue rasping over her skin. What Rio would give to feel that flexible firm muscle delving into her core. But she’s saving that for another session. Agatha is <i>desperate</i> for the chance to eat her out, has thrown multiple hissy fits <i>and</i> fake safeworded just because she was so mad the opportunity was taken away from her, so Rio is planning on utilizing it as a reward.</p><p>Being on her knees, collared and leashed, and licking at her dom’s fingers, appears to very much help Agatha sink into subspace. She seems almost hyper-focused on her task, her blue eyes glazed over. When Rio’s fingers are clean, Agatha turns her attention to her own, which are much wetter since they have just been buried inside herself. She raises them in a half-aborted movement to her mouth, hesitating.</p><p>Her brows furrow in deep thought. She peers up at Rio and, to her utter shock, asks, “May I clean my own fingers, sir?”</p><p>Rio’s heart explodes. Only two sessions in, and Agatha trusts her enough with her submission that she has learnt that she, as a sub, needs to ask permission from her dom before certain actions. She is unfathomably proud right now. “Yes, you may. You are such a good sub for asking permission. That was so respectful and polite, <i>bizcochito</i>, I’m <i>very</i> impressed.”</p><p>Agatha turns red. “You don’t have to lay on the praise <i>that</i> thick,” she mutters.</p><p>“You realized that as my sub, it was necessary for you to ask permission to do something, without me even needing to prompt you. That is praise-worthy, sweetheart,” Rio smiles.</p><p>Agatha responds with an adorable little huff, but it’s obvious she is pleased with herself and pleased with the praise from Rio, kitten-licking her own fingers clean rapidly and then obediently looking up at her dom, waiting for her next command. She is wading in the shallow sea of subspace, and most importantly, appears to be treading water there. She is happily floating, not fighting or thrashing, and not trying to dive deeper either. Just… hanging there.</p><p>And Rio is <i>ecstatic</i>. This is what she wants. She wants Agatha to enjoy the experience of subspace by riding the wave, not rising and falling continuously so often that it places her at risk of sub drop, and without sinking so far and retreating into her so much that it tips into pure dissociation.</p><p>Tweaking Agatha’s left nipple, Rio notes, “These are looking a little bare. Should we decorate them, so you look all pretty for your spanking?”</p><p>“Regretting not getting them pierced at sixteen when I had my ears secretly done,” Agatha murmurs, her eyes dazed.</p><p>Oh god, Agatha would look so gorgeous with gold studs pierced through her nipples. She imagines she would wear shield jewelry, with amethysts, or perhaps emeralds if Rio were to choose them. “It’s never too late.”</p><p>Agatha wets her lips, asking slyly, “Any other clamps you’re gonna use on me tonight?”</p><p>She’s either seen the vibrator clip, or she suspects Rio has brought it with her. “Wouldn’t you like to know?”</p><p>Unwilling to wait for her sub to stand up herself now, the dom hauls her up off the floor, ignoring her aggrieved sigh, and tosses her unceremoniously onto the bed on her back. Agatha sits back up immediately, her legs dangling off the end of the mattress. She is about to ask her what color she is, but then sees her sub mouthing, ‘<i>green</i>’, so she skips that step.</p><p>Fetching the nipple clamps and the chain linking them together from the dressing table, Rio tightens Agatha’s leash with one hand and uses the other to attach the clamps to the lawyer’s erect nipples, plucking at them with her fingers to ensure they’re hard before she applies the little clips so that they cause a biting, sharp pain.</p><p>Agatha, to her credit, maintains a stony expression throughout the process, not reacting to the pain, but a beautiful pink flush spreads over her collarbones and down between her breasts. The pain is arousing her. She sits perfectly still as Rio attaches the chain to her collar’s D-ring, next to where her leash is connected. Now, whenever Rio gives the leash a yank, it will pull at her clamped nipples as well.</p><p>She joins Agatha on the bed, sitting next to her at first, but then effortlessly picking up and maneuvering her sub so that she’s on her knees straddling Rio’s lap. She drops her leash so that she can palm Agatha’s ass cheeks, spreading them apart so that her cunt is further exposed to the air, which makes her instinctively rock her hips downwards onto Rio’s thighs, searching for stimulation.</p><p>Ducking her head, Rio arranges them so that Agatha’s arms are draped over the dom’s shoulders, her cuffed hands behind her head. They’re so close that they’re sharing breath now, their faces inches away from each other. It’s extremely intimate. Agatha’s gaze keeps darting between her eyes and her lips, chewing on her own, as if she’s imagining what it would feel like to kiss her.</p><p>“Look at me,” Rio requests in a soft murmur, smoothing her palm over her sub’s lower back. Agatha’s eyes flash to her, dark with desire. “I’m going to explain how I’m gonna carry out your spanking now, and I need you to listen closely, okay?”</p><p>For both of their safety, she, as Agatha’s dom, wants to make it a point that this is not just her using the label of ‘punishment’ to cause her sub pain. This spanking is meant to be purposeful discipline. The only way this is going to work as intended is if she communicates to Agatha what exactly is about to occur, and explains why.</p><p>She has already told Agatha what misbehaviors and disobedience from earlier in the session she is going to be punished for. But she hasn’t explained yet that she is being punished for what happened last Monday, and the top drop Rio suffered as a result.</p><p>“I’m listening,” Agatha agrees, her voice hoarse.</p><p>Rio nods, and informs her, “A dozen strikes in half an hour, you get one every two to three minutes. And Agatha, I’m going to warn you now - I am not going to hold back just because this is your first bout of discipline with me.”</p><p>The two-and-a-half-minute wait between each hit will undoubtedly make it even more painful, as the skin will have time to redden and swell and bruise before the next harsh slap. Rio has perfected her technique, knows her own strength, and understands how to control how much power she puts into each spank. She may experiment a little with the first couple, just to see what provokes louder moans and slick to gush from the junction of Agatha’s thighs, but she anticipates needing to spank her <i>hard</i>.</p><p>“You kick, or squirm, or fight, and you lose more strikes. You count, and thank me after each strike, explaining a reason why you are being punished. You verbally acknowledge every time I speak to you, and if you need a break, you call yellow. I will not punish you for doing so, <i>unless</i> you fake safeword,” Rio continues to elucidate.</p><p>Sliding her hands from Agatha’s buttocks up to her hips, trailing up her sides to then circle her thumbs around her clamped nipples, the dom smirks at the strained exhalation her touches elicit from her sub.</p><p>“Most importantly, you don’t hold back any sounds you make. You can cry, moan, and scream as much as you want, and I don’t want you muffling your voice.” She leans in to whisper raggedly, her lips brushing Agatha’s ear, “I want the whole street to know that Agatha Harkness is my bitch.” Her tongue darts out and she drags the tip of it slowly over Agatha’s cheek, a shiver of delight racing down her spine at the choked gasp it pulls from her sub’s throat. She pulls back to tilt her head and ask, “Any questions?”</p><p>Agatha shifts from side to side on Rio’s lap, trying to grind her clit up against Rio’s harness, wincing when she receives a chastising slap on her thigh. “Do I still get control over a future session since I got full marks on the pop quiz?” she asks hesitantly, after a moment of thought. “Or am I losing that since I came without permission?”</p><p>It’s a fair question, and one that Rio is not surprised Agatha would come up with, because of course she would be worried about losing her opportunity to assert control over one of their sessions. It’s as close to getting the chance to dominate Rio as she will get, without Rio actually returning the tables and submitting for her.</p><p>“You’ll still get your say when it comes to a future scene. You won that prize fair and square, by passing the test,” Rio assures her. Agatha visibly relaxes, her cuffed hands playing with the ends of Rio’s hair in her sleek high ponytail. Keeping one hand on her sub’s right hip to anchor her, Rio tugs on her leash and nipple clamp chain to focus her attention, flicking her clavicle. “But Agatha… after answering all of those questions correctly on the test, it means that my puppy should know why her dom was upset with her after last Monday.”</p><p>Agatha immediately blanches and shies away, lowering her eyes. Her body language conveys that she is slightly panicked. She throws her head back and shakes it, so that waves of her dark brown hair cascade down her spine. “Way to put me on the spot,” she scoffs defensively, throwing on a facade of indignance. But Rio sees straight through it. She’s afraid of saying something wrong.</p><p>Rio tips her chin back up and smiles at her tenderly, tucking loose strands of hair behind her sub’s ears. “Tell me, Agatha. I won’t punish you or take off strikes if you get the answer wrong, but you know it, I know you do,” she prompts.</p><p>All she wants is for Agatha to show growth. To demonstrate that she has learned. That she is able to take the information provided in the submission manual that she clearly read before she defaced it, and is able to apply that to their own dynamic. Agatha is wicked smart. It will not be difficult for her to reflect on her actions last Monday and figure out what she did wrong.</p><p>She doesn’t pressure Agatha to respond. Just waits, patiently. Agatha keeps scrunching her nose up and huffing in aggravation, trying her hardest to avoid eye contact, but Rio continually nudges her head back gently into position to meet her calm gaze. She ducks her head to escape Agatha’s arms and grasps hold of her hands, squeezing them.</p><p>Finally, after twenty seconds or so, Agatha speaks. Her voice is small, quiet, subdued, as she mumbles, “Aftercare is mandatory, and I didn’t allow you to perform it.” Rio purrs in approval, caressing her arms, nodding in hope that it will coax out more. “I - I put you at risk of top drop and myself at risk of sub drop, and I treated you disrespectfully by kicking you out.”</p><p>Rio shows her with praise, drawing her into her embrace and pressing kisses to the side of her head. “Good girl. Very good girl.” Agatha stiffens at first at the hug, but as the dom strokes up and down her spine, cradling her like some precious, delicate thing in her arms, the tension leaches out of her until she’s happily burying her face in Rio’s shoulder. And for once, Rio is not concerned that she might try to bite her. “That is mainly why I am punishing you. For refusing aftercare, and yes… you did actually trigger a top drop.”</p><p>Agatha goes very quiet. “Oh,” is all she is able to say, in a small voice.</p><p>“I don’t know if you have ever experienced sub or top drop before, but they’re similar, and it’s horrible,” Rio explains gently. “You feel sick and flu-ey for about a week as your body tries to recover from the physical shock of the adrenaline crash, and the emotional shock. I personally really struggle with intrusive thoughts and insomnia when I get top drop. I wasn’t in the right state of mind to meet with clients, so I couldn’t work.” She can feel Agatha’s body gradually growing more rigid within her embrace, and so tries to soothe her, clarifying, “I’m not telling you this to try and heap on the guilt, I just need you to understand that there are consequences to your actions, and what those consequences can be. There are two people involved in this dynamic, and so your mistakes can blow back and affect me negatively as well.”</p><p>Agatha draws back, frowning at her in worry, raising her own hands to cup Rio’s face. Perhaps she’s able to spot the persistent black bags under Rio’s eyes from the stress and sleepless nights of the last two weeks, because her expression crumples with guilt. She looks like a kicked puppy.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she breathes.</p><p>Rio blinks. She wasn’t expecting an apology, to be honest. She wanted one, yes, but she thought that Agatha might be too proud to apologize. But Agatha does appear to be, and sound, sincere and remorseful. “It’s okay.”</p><p>But Agatha shakes her head urgently, genuinely distressed, one hand curling around one of the straps of Rio’s chest harness as she insists frantically, “No, really, I’m - I’m sorry, I didn’t - I didn’t mean to hurt you, <i>I’m sorry</i> -”</p><p>“Hey, hey, it’s okay. I believe you,” Rio reassures her, a little alarmed to see the tiniest hint of tears brimming in her sub’s eyes.</p><p>“You do?” she checks, with a tone of incredulity.</p><p>Rio has to wonder why Agatha seems to think her apology won’t be accepted as true, and is so adamant about not intending to cause harm. Her whole job as a defense lawyer means she is essentially paid big bucks to lie on behalf of criminals constantly, and she has had no issues with trying to lie to Rio’s face before. Yet, it is the idea that her apology will be brushed off that is upsetting her.</p><p>It’s a trauma response, a sign that in the past, she had a partner refuse to believe her, possibly even to the point of holding a grudge and punishing her for it; she may have been gaslighted, which considering everything else she had heard about Agatha’s most recent abusive ex, tracks with her pattern of manipulation. Rio makes a mental note of it, filing it away for later.</p><p>“Yeah, of course I do. I forgive you. And like I said before, you accept your punishment, and then we put it behind us,” Rio iterates.</p><p>She doesn’t like to hold onto resentment for very long, lest it fester and sour her opinion and relationship with a person. In her youth, she tended to hang on to her grievances for days, weeks, sometimes months at a time, until she matured and realized that it was emotionally draining her and not at all healthy to dwell on her problems with people, when they could be easily solved with communication.</p><p>Agatha once again relaxes, her shoulders slumping in visible relief. At this point, Rio gently moves her to the side, off of her lap. She makes sure to stroke her fingers through Agatha’s hair in affection, to show her that she is not mad, before clicking her fingers and pointing down at the bed to command ‘stay’.</p><p>She crosses over to the dresser to swipe up the handcuff key, her leather gloves, and the anti-slip pad. The gloves are stuffed beneath one of the straps of her harness, the pad is tucked beneath her arm, and the key she keeps in her left non-dominant hand.</p><p>“You behave and I’ll even let you choose the position I fuck you in after,” Rio calls over her shoulder. Offering some sort of incentive is always the best way to entice Agatha into being compliant. When she turns back around, Agatha is staring at her shrewdly. “What?”</p><p>“You’re still gonna fuck me after?” the lawyer says in bemusement, cocking her head. “What’s the point if you’re not gonna let me come anyway? You’ve already edged me twice.”</p><p>Her tone is sulky, on the verge of whiny. It annoys her. Returning to the bed, Rio grasps hold of Agatha’s leash with her free hand to shorten it as she towers over her. “The <i>point</i> is that I <i>want</i> to fuck you until I come,” she hisses. “I will derive pleasure from the act of fucking you knowing you won’t get to orgasm at the end. You’re a masochist, Agatha, you know just as well as I do just how enjoyable consecutive edging and denial can be. Delayed gratification leads to the sweetest and most mind-blowing orgasms of all time.”</p><p>“Easy for you to say, you’re not the one who’s gonna be denied,” Agatha replies snarkily.</p><p>Very easy for Rio to say, actually, because she <i>loves</i> to be edged like crazy when she subs. One of her previous girlfriends denied her orgasms for three weeks, once; she worked her up with a wand vibrator every single night until Rio was so desperate to cum after twenty-five days that she fell to her knees and <i>begged</i> for an orgasm.</p><p>She has a feeling that if Agatha were to ever discover that, she would find it utterly hilarious, and it would be extremely dangerous for Rio, especially if she does end up agreeing to submit for her.</p><p>“How about this, hmm? You behave during your punishment, I fuck and edge you until I think you’ve had enough, because let’s be honest, you’re not gonna tap out, are you?” Rio raises an eyebrow. Agatha shrugs as if to say ‘fair assessment’. She would probably allow Rio to fuck her unconscious and then ask her to do it again next session, harder and faster. “However many times I edge you today, is how many orgasms I will reward you next session.”</p><p>“So I’ve already won two?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Agatha grimaces. “<i>Fine</i>, but that’s such a convoluted and delayed reward system.”</p><p>“You’re a lawyer who specializes in exploiting the intricacies and loopholes in contracts, and twisting and charming judges until they fold and give you what you want,” Rio comments, ghosting her fingers beneath Agatha’s collar, adjusting it on her neck so that the silver tag, labeling her a <i>sub in training</i>, gleams in the low light. “Just trying to match your level of freak, darling.” She tosses her gloves and the pad on the bed, waving the handcuff key. “Hands out.”</p><p>Because she clearly just loves being contrary and troublesome, Agatha shuffles back on the bed, away from Rio, shoving her cuffed hands between her thighs so they are inaccessible to her. She retreats far enough that her leash is pulled taut; Rio is reluctant to really jerk her leash because of how much it will tighten the collar around her neck and yank on her nipple clamps to cause some real damage.</p><p>The dom sighs in exasperation, because <i>really?</i> They’re still doing this running away shit? Rio places the key on the mattress and lunges to seize Agatha’s ankles, dragging her back towards her. Agatha’s legs instinctively spread, which allows Rio to grab the handcuff chain with one hand and bring her other down between her sub’s thighs in a hefty <i>slap</i> against her sore pussy.</p><p>Agatha yelps like a cat whose tail as been stepped on, her thighs flying closed as she chokes out, “Fuck!”</p><p>“Hands. Out,” Rio orders sharply.</p><p>This time Agatha hastily offers them, scowling but obviously not all that eager to get her pussy spanked again, which Rio knows from experience can be extremely painful. “Damn, you couldn’t just ask nicely?” she mutters. “Would it kill you to utter the word ‘please’?”</p><p>“You act like it would kill you,” Rio points out.</p><p>“That’s because saying ‘please’ is for suckers in the legal world.” She plasters on a fake pleading pout, simpering, “Oh, <i>please, please</i>, listen to me I’m so important, <i>please</i> let me waste your time by lying to you about being innocent, <i>please</i> bail me out, <i>please</i> have mercy on me and let me get away with all these horrific crimes I’ve committed.” She rolls her eyes and mimes gagging.</p><p>“You’ve said please to me before.”</p><p>A shadowed look appears on Agatha’s face, and she clenches her jaw. “Yes, well, only under duress,” she mutters. Rio would correct her to ‘in <i>distress</i>’, but it’s fairly clear that her sub no longer wishes to discuss this, judging by how she tugs her cuffed hands apart impatiently.</p><p>Snagging the key, Rio commands her with a stern, flat look to stay still, unlocking the cuffs. “I’m cuffing your hands behind your back now because I can’t trust my puppy not to sneak her fingers between her thighs to try and have a little play with herself while bent over my lap,” she remarks. She glances up at Agatha’s expression as she speaks, to carefully watch her reaction, and is glad she does so when she sees something akin to trepidation and dread flit over her flushed face. “Is that okay?”</p><p>“You’re gonna do whatever the hell you want anyway,” Agatha says mirthlessly, sneering at her.</p><p>“You’re finally learning who’s in charge here,” Rio snorts.</p><p>She pokes and prods at her sub until she swivels around on the bed so she’s facing the headboard, sitting cross-legged. Agatha doesn’t do it of her own accord, so Rio is forced to take hold of her hands and wrest them behind her back. As soon as she snaps the first cuff on, however, Agatha’s back straightens and turns rigid. She doesn’t just hold her breath - she stops breathing altogether.</p><p>Something is wrong.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio asks quietly.</p><p>Her sub’s head jerks to the side as she tries to peer over her shoulder at Rio behind her, tense and uneasy. “I’m fine.” Contrary to that, there is a hunted, haunted look in her clouded blue eyes. Despite her agitation, she tries to joke, “Do you want me to whip out my Kermit the Frog impression to tell you I’m green? Because it’ll ruin the mood.”</p><p>She is not fine. She is very clearly feeling uncomfortable. But she is insisting she is okay, and while usually, Rio would object and point out her own observation of Agatha’s discomfort, and change her plans to accommodate her sub’s obvious aversion to having her hands cuffed behind her back… she pauses, thinking.</p><p>Agatha is not communicating. She’s nervous and restless, but trying to hide it from Rio. She is not effectively expressing her boundaries, as she promised Rio she would attempt to do when they discussed safewords in their post-session debrief last week.</p><p>Rio knows that it’s not because Agatha doesn’t trust her, or is worried that she will be punished for safewording. She likes to think that she has proven to Agatha that she will rapidly respond to any traffic light or safeword call. Maybe Agatha’s little game last session, where she fake-called yellow for her itchy back, was in fact a test. Perhaps she was trialing Rio, to see if she would actually slow down if she falsely safeworded. It makes too much sense.</p><p>And it also makes sense that she is not safewording now, when she feasibly needs to for real. The dom is no psychologist, and only has mental health first aid training, so she’s not at all qualified to diagnose - but it’s almost as if there is some kind of mental block in Agatha’s brain, caused by past trauma, that is preventing her from telling Rio to stop. Probably a trained, conditioned response as a result of a previous dom not stopping when Agatha requested them to.</p><p>Now, Rio is not the kind of dom who ignores the blatant anxious body language her sub gives off. If this were any other incident, she would call yellow and halt the scene herself to check in on Agatha, or even call red so they could sit, talk, and properly establish this new line not to cross.</p><p>As a professional dominatrix who deeply cares about the well-being of her clients, Rio never wants to push them so far that they are forced to safeword, because she fully understands that even though they are engaging in consensual BDSM, it is much more important that her sub remains safe and sane of mind.</p><p>Despite that… today, Rio is going to gently push that boundary. It sounds utterly diabolical to want to force Agatha to safeword, but at least if she does, it shatters that mental block, and allows Rio to reassure her sub that she will be listened to. She wants Agatha to have a first-hand experience of Rio stopping because Agatha commands her to, so that she knows for certain, from now on, that she has complete control over the sessions if she does need to safeword.</p><p>She will, of course, stop the scene entirely if Agatha doesn’t call red or safeword. She will not actually handcuff her behind her back when she can sense how fearful and perturbed she is. But Rio wants Agatha to think she is going to.</p><p>It’s an extreme moral dilemma to carry out this kind of unscrupulous experiment, but Rio can justify it in her mind, as it ultimately follows the ethical principle of double effect. She will be causing a tiny amount of harm, but she is doing so with the intention of building further trust between her and Agatha, and aiding her sub in breaking through that anti-safeword psychological barrier.</p><p>Shaking her head to dissipate the rest of that mental tangent, Rio focuses back on her sub, who is sitting unnaturally still, with her arms slightly straining against the dom’s grasp. “You start singing ‘<i>Bein’ Green</i>’ and next session, I’ll truss you like a turkey, string you up from the ceiling in a sex swing, and force you to watch <i>The Muppets Movie</i> from beginning to end with a vibrator up your ass,” Rio says simply. “I’ll bring popcorn and masturbate behind you the entire time.”</p><p>“Oh god, do not involve <i>Sesame Street</i> in your dirty talk and BDSM scenes, that’s so weird,” Agatha groans.</p><p>“You’re the one who brought poor Kermit into this in the first place,” Rio reminds her.</p><p>She keeps a very cautious eye on Agatha’s reaction as she slips the other cuff around her other wrist, not actually closing it and locking it in place, but just pressing it against the inside of her wrist, so she can feel the pressure of it. Bowing her head with a ragged, shallow inhalation, Rio’s heart <i>aches</i> as she watches Agatha close her eyes, turning ashen in pallor, her brow deeply furrowed. For a moment, it appears as if she’s going to attempt to tolerate it, even though she begins to tremble.</p><p>Rio instantly regrets her decision to push Agatha into safewording - the hell was she thinking? - and is about to say red herself when the lawyer bursts out, “Fuck, yellow. Shit. Safeword. <i>Stop,</i>” with a broken sob.</p><p>Rio swiftly pulls her wrist out of the half-closed cuff, quickly unlocks the other to free her hand, and slides across the bed to gather Agatha in a hug. The removal of the handcuffs seems to reverse her terrible reaction to them in a flash, and she stops shaking the moment they’re tossed to the other side of the bed, no longer binding her wrists behind her. Agatha hunches over, her head in her hands, which she also uses to hide her face. Rio can’t tell whether or not she’s crying from her position, but she rubs up and down her back anyway.</p><p>“Good girl. Good girl for telling me to stop,” she whispers. “I’m so proud of you.”</p><p>Agatha shoves her. Hard. And Rio can’t bring herself to feel angry at her for it, especially when her sub croaks out, “I fucking hate you. You did that on purpose. You wanted me to safeword.”</p><p>Hearing the words <i>I hate you</i> strikes Rio in the heart just as painfully as a blade being thrust into her chest would, but she pushes through it, more worried about managing Agatha’s emotional load than her own.</p><p>“Yes, I did. I’m sorry, <i>cariño</i>, but you were clearly uncomfortable and you were pushing forward with green even though you weren’t happy with what I was doing,” she sighs. “I needed to test you to see if I could actually trust you to stop me from crossing that line. I wasn’t gonna keep going, I promise I would have stopped and called red myself, but I wanted to see if you would.” She squeezes Agatha’s knee, and emits a hushed sound of relief when Agatha rests her own hand on top of hers, seeking physical affection for comfort. “And you did, you expressed your boundary. You don’t like having your hands tied behind your back?”</p><p>Agatha nods, staring down at where their fingers are entwined in her lap. Her other hand she runs through her sweaty hair, which has fallen into her face. “I don’t mind it if they’re tied, with ropes or ribbon or something fabric. I just - I don’t like handcuffs,” she confesses. “Used to be a big thing for my ex. It was - how she maintained control. I can escape handcuffs if they’re loose enough, but she would tighten them to the point of my circulation cutting off sometimes.”</p><p>Rage floods Rio’s veins, hearing that, because that is insanely dangerous, how <i>dare</i> somebody do that and have the audacity to call themself a dominant? How dare someone do that to <i>Agatha?</i> If she ever finds out who Agatha’s ex is, that woman is <i>dead</i>.</p><p>“So if my hands are cuffed behind my back, it - it reminds me of things I’d rather forget,” Agatha carries on, ignorant of her rising anger. Which is a good thing, because Rio doesn’t want her to think it’s directed at her. “I thought I was over it and could suppress it, but… I guess not. I know <i>you</i> wouldn’t hurt me like that, but I guess I still don’t - I don’t…”</p><p>She’s beginning to shiver again just being forced into talking about the memory, so Rio interrupts her gently, distracting her by leaning in to press a kiss to her shoulder blade. Her lips against Agatha’s warm skin quickly cause her to trail off, blinking at Rio slowly.</p><p>“It’s okay. You don’t like it. That’s okay. We’ll keep your hands cuffed in front,” the dom murmurs. “You called yellow before you safeworded, so I’m assuming you want to carry on the scene, it was just the handcuffing that you wanted to put a stop to?”</p><p>“I want to continue the scene,” Agatha says assertively, almost insistent. “I just wasn’t sure if… if I called yellow, whether we’d just take a break and you’d still handcuff me from behind. I wanted you to stop.” She looks wary, as if concerned she’s done something wrong.</p><p>“And you used your safeword correctly. It just means we stop play immediately. Doesn’t mean we can’t carry on after a check-in. It’s the best and quickest way for you to establish a hard no boundary with me, and I appreciate you using it.” Rio kisses her shoulder again in silent praise. “I won’t handcuff you from behind ever again. What I am gonna do though is ask that when I bend you over my lap, you hold them out in front of you and grip onto the pillow, so I can see them. Does that work for you?”</p><p>The spanking will be Agatha’s punishment, yes, and it will hurt, but she doesn’t want to cause her unnecessary additional discomfort during it. Ordering her to grasp onto a pillow so that her hands are visible at all times is a viable compromise, in her mind. Her dom wants to maintain full control over Agatha when she’s lying over her lap.</p><p>Agatha nods, finally lifting her head to meet Rio’s gaze. “Yes, that’s better.” Her eyes are watery but clear, not murky and stormy as they were before. And with the tightness easing from her muscles, she looks as if a weight has been lifted from her shoulders. She worries her lower lip for a few seconds before asking shyly, “You really would have stopped even if I didn’t call safeword? You could… tell I needed to?”</p><p>Rio begins to get set up for the spanking, nudging Agatha back on the bed so that she can turn back the covers, and arrange the pillows appropriately. “You were tensing up. You get this adorable little furrow between your eyebrows, right… here,” she stretches across the bed to tentatively tap her fingertip against the specific spot, dragging her finger down the length of Agatha’s nose before pulling away, “When you’re upset but suppressing it.”</p><p>A gentle tug on Agatha’s leash encourages her up and off the bed, onto her feet, where she waits with remarkable patience and placidity. It gives Rio the opportunity to double-check her collar tightness, after all of the yanking and struggling earlier; once she’s ensured there’s no chafing and the collar isn't cutting into her sub’s skin, she trails her hand down to her sternum, plucking at the nipple clamp chain playfully until Agatha whimpers pathetically.</p><p>Rio shortens her leash and clutches her lightly around the throat, then, turning her face either way and wiping away the traces of tears from her flushed cheeks. There’ll be plenty more tears later, she’s sure. Tears she will gleefully lick up from Agatha’s face, which she will pepper with appreciative kisses after she withstands her spanking.</p><p>“I can’t believe you noticed that,” Agatha mutters under her breath in awe.</p><p>“<i>Te veo, perrita</i>,” she purrs, reveling in the way the deep timbre of her voice makes Agatha’s eyes darken, her breath stuttering.</p><p><i>Perrita?</i> she sees Agatha mouth, because it’s a new term of endearment for her - but Rio won’t explain it. She’ll let her look it up after the session ends, to discover the two meanings herself; puppy, and little bitch. It’s an affectionate nickname that fulfills her praise kink and degradation kink simultaneously.</p><p>Rio doesn’t even need to draw her crop out and run it over Agatha’s breasts to create goosebumps; just her fingers circling her nipples are enough to make all the hairs on her sub’s body stand on end.</p><p>“What does that mean?” Agatha breathes.</p><p>“It means… even when you’re trying to hide your emotions from me, trying to dampen down your instinctive reactions, I see you,” she murmurs. “I don’t blame you for any of that, considering how you have been treated in the past. But it just makes it all the more important that I stay tuned in to your body language to understand and anticipate your needs, if you have trouble communicating them. I react to those non-verbal cues most of the time.”</p><p>Realization sparks in Agatha’s eyes. She appears intrigued, tilting her head to the side like a curious cocker spaniel. “So all of the verbal check-ins…”</p><p>The interest is a good thing. Agatha is <i>learning</i>, and eager for more information. Rio is educating her about healthy BDSM dynamics and communication between a dom and their sub.</p><p>“To remind you of the safeword system; to include you in the decision-making. So you know the option is always gonna be there to safeword, even if you never choose to,” Rio informs her. “I watch you, Agatha, just as closely as I can tell you probably watch everybody else. I have a duty as your dom to ensure your continued safety and comfort during our scenes, but my attentiveness goes beyond that - beyond obligation.”</p><p>A beat, and then Agatha echoes softly, “Beyond?” in a strange tone of voice. Confused, possibly. Almost, Rio would hazard a guess, a touch hopeful.</p><p>Rio takes a deep breath. How can she even begin to describe to Agatha how profoundly she has come to care about her? Lust and attraction that border on obsession and possessiveness, and fondness and affection that border on… the L-word.</p><p>Two drop-down options to fill in that word: lesbianism and love. Both oddly fit. And Rio isn’t sure what <i>kind</i> of love it is precisely, which terrifies her.</p><p>Still, she’s beginning to realize that <i>denying</i> that it is a form of love is only detrimental to the relationship and trust she and Agatha are building, brick by brick. She won’t admit it yet - certainly not to Agatha - because she needs to sit with this newfound awareness of her feelings for a little while, to process everything herself. Because who knows… maybe she’s mistaken.</p><p>Maybe she is in over her head and letting her sexual desires and dominant drive guide her emotions too much. Maybe the connection she is feeling to Agatha is being heightened by the sex they are having, because they have incredible bedroom chemistry.</p><p>Either way… Rio needs to think. Probably needs to call her old therapist or a close friend and talk through it with them for a second opinion, as well.</p><p>For now, though, Agatha is eagerly waiting for an answer from her, eyeing her beadily. She’s staring at the dom as if she’s a particularly perplexing puzzle she needs to solve. Rio has no clue what she wants her to say, so she decides to be honest. “I care about you, and not just as a client. I consider you my partner in this dynamic. I’m not just doing this for a pay cheque. I want to spend time with you and I want to ensure that you enjoy submission in this safe and consensual environment with me,” she says carefully.</p><p>She doesn’t want to downplay the connection she feels between them, but also is aware that this is meant to be a professional relationship, although they have sort of graduated to friends-with-benefits on top of that. Agatha seems to accept her words at face value, bobbing her head in a thoughtful nod, but judging by the slight purse to her lips, she was hoping to perhaps hear… not something else, but maybe more. What more she wanted to hear will keep Rio awake tonight, lying in bed whilst ruminating.</p><p>But she doesn’t have time to think about her and Agatha’s potential feelings right now - she needs to get back on task. Situating herself comfortably on the edge of the bed, her feet planted on the floor, she pulls the anti-slip pad over her thighs, so that it covers up the straps of her harness. The dom tucks her leather gloves behind her, just within reach, and picks up the handcuffs again, rattling them at her sub.</p><p>“I’m going to cuff your hands again now,” Rio explains, which ends up being unnecessary, because as soon as the cuffs are in her hands, Agatha steps forward and offers her wrists, much to her surprise. She doesn’t even try to run, fight, or complain. She is clearly just as excited as Rio about her punishment - or just wants to get it over with. “Can I get your color?”</p><p>It’s important for her to restart the session with a color check after a safeword call, especially since it’s unusual that she does end up continuing scenes after. Agatha doesn’t attempt a joke this time, simply responding, “Green.” She stands still, her dark-eyed gaze fixed on Rio’s face, as the dom attaches the handcuffs one shackle at a time, checking they are not going to hurt her or cut off circulation. She flexes her fingers and swallows, her eyes drifting down to Rio’s lap as she shuffles restlessly on her feet. “Is it time?”</p><p>Rio nods, pulling on her leash lightly so that her collar applies gentle pressure around her neck.  “Come.”</p><p>“Thought I wasn’t allowed to do that anymore this session,” Agatha snipes, which promptly results in her hissing in pain when Rio yanks on her leash more aggressively in reprimand. “<i>Christ</i>, you keep doing that and I’m gonna look like I’ve been <i>strangled</i> because of the bruises. My colleagues at work are gonna ask questions.”</p><p>“Not my problem. <i>Heel</i>,” the dom snaps. “And from now on, you only speak when spoken to, and to perform your three tasks after each strike. Show me you’ve been paying attention - what are they?”</p><p>Once Agatha is standing with her knees pressed up against Rio’s thigh, with her only viable next move being bending over, Rio raises a hand to trail it up the back of her nearest leg. “I count the strikes, thank you after each one, and tell you one of the reasons why I’m being punished,” Agatha recites, and under her breath, then adds sullenly, “Whether it’s a valid reason or not, because you’re a fucking hardass.”</p><p>Tutting, Rio pinches the back of her thigh, triggering her to wince. “Over my lap. Now,” she commands.</p><p>Despite her prior grumbling, Agatha clambers onto the bed and crawls over Rio’s legs with all the fervor of a boisterous puppy, demonstrating why her pet name is so applicable. She is slightly more cautious as she gingerly lowers herself onto Rio’s lap, so her ass faces upwards; she obediently stretches her cuffed hands out in front of her and curls her fingers around a pillow, and after a moment of wiggling to get comfortable, she stills, waiting.</p><p>Rio smirks, taking hold of Agatha’s leash with her non-dominant hand and settling it on her upper back, between her shoulder blades, to very lightly pin her in place. With her dominant hand, she pets up and down the length of Agatha’s back, being careful to skate over and around her scars.</p><p>She continues to stroke over her spine until her sub relaxes, and only then does the dom trail her hand down to her buttocks, feeling the strong muscles tense beneath her palm. Fingers dip in between her legs to graze over her sticky thighs and trace her dripping slit, the stimulation enough to draw a faint whimper from Agatha, before turning to her ass cheeks, kneading them tenderly.</p><p>“Considering this is your first spanking with me, I need to figure out the amount of force to use to punish you,” Rio starts off calmly. “So you, my lucky girl, get some free strikes, that won’t count towards your twelve total. I’m going to spank you now, at different spots on your ass, with different strengths. After each one, I want you to tell me where they are on the pain scale for you. One being me pinching you -” She gives her ass a tiny pinch, one that she knows will hurt less than a bee sting - “And ten being when I pinched your clit earlier. I’m going to stop when you reach a six. Understand?”</p><p>Agatha exhales slowly, turning her face so it’s not pressed into the bedspread. “Yes, sir.”</p><p>Rio nods.</p><p>
<i>Smack.</i>
</p><p>The first hit is a gentle one, glancing off her ass cheeks and not even leaving any pink behind. Agatha jumps, even though it doesn’t hurt at all, just from the shock of it. Rio spanks her deliberately lightly, knowing that the first hit is the one that always surprises her subs the most, regardless of how much force she puts into it. She doesn’t want to start by walloping Agatha’s behind, doesn’t want her to immediately associate going over Rio’s lap with blinding pain. This is a punishment, yes, but she doesn’t want Agatha flinching away from her after.</p><p>“Raise to the power of zero,” Agatha says, which, of course, makes no sense.</p><p>Rio blinks. “What?”</p><p>“Any number raised to the power of zero,” her sub sighs, as if the answer is obvious. “Or times by zero, really,” she adds cockily. That cockiness won’t last long. Rio strikes again, with twice the force. Agatha doesn’t jolt this time, but her skin colors a beautiful pale pink. “The number of times you’ve edged me so far.”</p><p>“Can you just - <i>not</i> play any fucking games with me for once, and say proper numbers? I don’t wanna solve math equations or decipher riddles to understand what you’re saying.” Communication during a punishment is absolutely vital, and Agatha is making a mockery of it.</p><p>“You’re taking all the fun out of this,” her sub complains. Again, Rio hits, aiming specifically for the center of Agatha’s ass this time. Agatha clenches her cheeks together. “Third of a dozen.”</p><p>“<i>Agatha</i>.”</p><p>“C’mon, that’s an easy one.” When Rio reaches out to close her thumb and forefinger around her clit threateningly, she grits out, “Okay, four.”</p><p>With each spank, Rio sinks deeper and deeper into dom headspace, getting cozy and comfy, feeling warmth spread through her veins, and her arousal spark and smolder within her lower abdomen.</p><p>“Six,” Agatha hisses, when Rio aims a harsher strike lower, on her more tender sit-spots, with her palm connecting with the skin with a <i>slap</i>. Her skin is flushed and hot beneath Rio’s hand.</p><p>“Good,” Rio responds simply.</p><p>Agatha has a much higher pain tolerance than she expected. She’s not expecting to get above a seven on the pain scale whilst only using her bare hand. She didn’t bring her paddle today, but plans to pull on leather gloves after five spanks, and then use her riding crop to administer the last three strikes.</p><p>“We’re starting now.”</p><p>“Fucking finally,” she hears Agatha mumble, and then she quickly shuts up when Rio swings her hand down for the first real strike. <i>SMACK</i>. Splotches of rosy pink appear on her ass cheeks. The dom in her trills happily when Agatha exhales slowly, hands fisting the pillow she’s clutching. “One,” she forces out. “Thank you, sir. I’m being punished because of how poorly I treated you during our post-scene debrief last Monday.”</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Rio replies smugly. “And yes, you did treat me very poorly. Care to elaborate? You’ve got two and a half minutes to fill.”</p><p>“Seriously?” Agatha groans, and then gurgles when Rio tweaks her clit, her legs jerking. “W-what are you -”</p><p>“Just entertaining myself,” she says, in an innocent tone, flicking her fingertips up and down Agatha’s entrance, spreading her slick up to her clit, using it to paint over the back of her thighs. “Speak, puppy.”</p><p>Agatha huffs, but goes on to explain, detailing how she first masturbated with her vibrator and her butt plug without Rio’s permission, then didn’t allow her to perform aftercare after they had sex, and then kicked her out of the house, only contacting her a week later. It’s at the end of this statement that Rio strikes her again, her palm connecting with Agatha’s ass directly over the previous spot she spanked which is already stinging with pain.</p><p>The two to three minute wait in between each spank is not only to draw out the punishment and raise anticipation, but also so that blood rushes to Agatha’s bruised ass after the hit, meaning the next strike is amplified, and even more painful. Twiddling her clit and teasingly fingering her causes Agatha to ride a high of pain mixed with pleasure, which can be overstimulating while leaving her desperate and needy for more.</p><p>Agatha counts, and submissively thanks her after each spank. By the fourth strike, she has drifted back into subspace, her voice becoming low and slightly slurred, her body boneless as she allows her full weight to rest on Rio’s lap. Her next listed reasons for deserving punishment are her use of weaponized compliance, numerous attempts to run away, and nearly asphyxiating herself on Rio’s strap.</p><p>In the two and a half minutes in between each spank, Rio waits for her to spell out exactly what she did wrong, and why, until she’s satisfied. Down in subspace, Agatha is no longer fully aware of time passing, so sometimes Rio makes her wait longer than three minutes just to hear her ramble apologies, and sometimes she only makes her wait two before spanking her again.</p><p>The fifth spank is aimed at her sit-spots, a firm <i>slap</i> that lands directly on sensitive skin, triggering Agatha to keen and squirm, trying to twist away. Rio holds her steady, humming warningly.</p><p>A tremble shivers down her sub’s spine, and her voice is strained as she chokes out, “Five. Fuck, I’m sorry, sir. Thank you. I was… I was rude, I came without your permission even though I knew I s-shouldn’t.”</p><p>Hearing the shake in Agatha’s voice should delight Rio’s dom. This is what she wanted, after all. She wanted Agatha to suffer during her punishment; she wanted her to be remorseful. She wanted her to pay for pushing Rio into top drop last week. And yet… she finds that she is not getting as much satisfaction out of this as she thought she would.</p><p>Witnessing Agatha in pain is not <i>enjoyable</i>. It’s upsetting. And maybe that’s because she knows now that Agatha has suffered pain from her doms before, and likely not consensually; she’s been permanently scarred, physically and emotionally, by abusive BDSM practices.</p><p>But it’s also Rio’s heart that’s crying out in protest. She realizes she hasn’t properly processed her negative feelings from the top drop - the guilt, the concern, the self-hatred. Seeing Agatha struggling… it makes her stomach feel cramped, with twinges of nausea.</p><p>She wonders briefly if she should tap out, but then shakes her head. Rio needs to complete this. For Agatha’s sake, as well as her own. This punishment is something they both sorely need to solidify their relationship and dynamic as a dom and a sub. Agatha needs to respect her authority, and for that, this spanking needs to stick with her, to act as a deterrent against future disobedient behavior.</p><p>“Gloves going on now,” she informs Agatha, who whines and pushes her ass upwards as she arches her back instinctively. <i>The lordosis reflex</i>, Rio recalls, having read about it in a biology textbook when she took a zoology elective in college. Non-primate behavior, but showing sexual receptiveness. Agatha is immensely turned on by the idea of her slapping her ass wearing leather gloves. “Four with gloves, and then the last three I will use my riding crop.”</p><p>“Oh god oh god oh god,” Agatha mutters under her breath, barely audible, as she buries her bright red face into the sheets and she heaves for oxygen. “Fuck, Rio, you’re gonna kill me.”</p><p>She has to wipe her fingers, covered in Agatha’s juices, dry on the mattress, before she works her hands into the gloves. Once they’re snug, she uses her non-dominant hand holding her leash to gather her sub’s sweat-soaked dark hair from where it’s covering her neck.</p><p>She pushes the tousled locks to the side, exposing Agatha’s collar, which she gives a tug before dragging her gloved fingers down Agatha’s spine, the leather cold and smooth against her skin. Agatha moans as her pulling on her leash tightens the collar around her throat, at the same time as Rio slipping two gloved fingers into her pussy, scissoring them open wide to spread her swollen lower lips.</p><p>“Kill you? When you’re <i>this</i> wet for me?” Rio teases her in a mocking tone. “Oh no, I think you’re <i>loving</i> this, <i>perrita</i>. Your sheets and my legs would be drenched if I didn’t have this mat on my lap. I’m starting to think I should be buying you puppy pads if this greedy little hole can’t help itself from leaking everywhere.”</p><p>“Can’t really - help it when - you’re fingering me - like that,” Agatha wheezes, choking on her last word when Rio jabs her fingers inwards to briefly graze her G-spot.</p><p>The dom tuts when she withdraws her hand from inside of her, revealing glistening juices soaking her leather glove. “You’re going to ruin my gloves, sweetheart. Maybe you should grab me a hairbrush to spank you with instead.”</p><p>She doesn’t give Agatha time to respond, slapping her gloved hand down onto her ass. The leather striking skin produces a sharp cracking sound, and Agatha, who was not expecting the hit, squeals in astonishment and pain; she nearly throws herself off Rio’s lap onto the floor, and the only reason she doesn’t fall is because Rio hooks her spare hand’s fingers around her collar, ensuring she’s secured in place.</p><p>“<i>Shit</i>, six,” Agatha wheezes. “Oh fuck.” She braces her cuffed hands on the mattress so she can lift up her torso slightly from the bed, blowing stray strands of hair out of her face as she gulps down oxygen. She peers over her shoulder back at Rio with a dazed expression. “I forgot how much leather on skin can hurt.”</p><p>Rio massages her beaten buttock gently, wincing when she sees the bright red handprint left behind on her sub’s pale skin. Okay, maybe she should have struck her with a little less force, taking into account how the leather hits harder and leaves a longer-lasting sting and a deeper welt.</p><p>“Give me a color?” she requests, needing the reassurance that Agatha is doing okay, and giving her the chance to call yellow for a break if she needs it.</p><p>The lawyer obviously does not call yellow, and instead emits a quiet, amused snigger. Her eyes gleam cheekily as she quips, “T​he color of your shirt when you were sixteen at the yogurt shop.”</p><p>It doesn’t register at first. Rio is just left staring at her, baffled, wondering what the fuck she’s talking about. But as she runs the phrase through her mind over and over again, it suddenly clicks. “Did you just - quote a Taylor Swift lyric at me?” she says, confused. “<i>You</i> listen to Taylor Swift?”</p><p>And <i>invisible string</i> isn’t one of her radio hits; it’s more of a deep-cut track on <i>folklore</i>, so Agatha doesn’t just casually listen. She must be a fan. And Rio feels her heart skip a beat, because she can’t help but think that there must be some significance to her specifically quoting a song about the red string of fate linking two soulmates together.</p><p>Agatha chuckles, using her cuffed hands to draw the pillow she’s sunk her fingers into closer, until she can comfortably rest her head on it, with her arms tucked beneath. “So do you, apparently, since you knew it within seconds. And of course, I listen to Taylor Swift, genius recognizes genius, and I consider myself an intellectual. I mean, did you know there was a research survey conducted by the University of Miami where they showed that she was the favorite artist of students with the highest GPAs,” she sniffs. “The color’s teal, in case you hadn’t worked that out yet.”</p><p>No, Rio worked that out as soon as she remembered the lyric. That does not change or solve her bemusement. “Teal’s not green.”</p><p>A silent beat, and then Agatha rolls onto her side, which Rio allows by loosening her grasp on her leash, just so that she can face her. Her cheeks are glowing pink with a flush that spreads down her neck to her breasts. The nipple clamps have been rubbing her poor nipples red raw from lying on her front, the chain leaving a mark where it’s been pressing up against her chest.</p><p>“Yes, it is,” Agatha frowns, licking her dry lips.</p><p>Rio shakes her head, caressing Agatha’s hip soothingly with her leather-gloved palm. “It’s a greenish blue. You could have used a more appropriate lyric from <i>invisible string</i> instead. ‘The color of the grass where I used to read at Centennial Park’ <i>actually</i> describes green. Unlike teal. Which is blue.”</p><p>Agatha huffs, bristling. She tries to sit up, but Rio’s dom rears her head furiously, snarling in protest. She slaps the hand holding her leash on her back, to knock her sub back down on her belly over Rio’s lap with an <i>oof</i>. But that doesn’t knock the fight out of her - she raises her head and breathlessly counters, “No, teal is bluish <i>green</i>. Teal is to green what turquoise is to blue.”</p><p>Rio runs a hand over her face. “Why are we arguing about Taylor Swift lyrics and colors?”</p><p>This is such a stupid little squabble they are having in the middle of what is meant to be Agatha’s punishment. She shouldn’t have stopped spanking her to ask her color, when she already knew it was going to be green. Now she’s been dragged into this disagreement, because Agatha is a bratty little shit who loves to rile her up.</p><p>“Because you can’t seem to accept that teal is more green than it is blue,” Agatha fires back. Rio is about to sigh heavily and prompt them to move on, because this is not going to be a productive conversation when her sub is such a stubborn ass, when Agatha suddenly says, in a somewhat distant, wistful voice, “My ex used to say my eyes were teal.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers, which have been tracing random symbols over Agatha’s back, fall still. Her sub has previously spoken about her abusive ex with contempt, disappointment, and even bitter shame, especially when she was expressing to Rio that she still doesn’t fully understand why she allowed her ex to treat her so terribly, and why she agreed to pretend to be her dead husband during sex. But she has never before spoken about her with just… abject sadness.</p><p>Rio knows what it’s like to miss a person you once loved, who you believed loved you. She understands that feeling all too well. Her heart aches, and the dom clenches her jaw. Agatha deserved better than the bitch who treated her like shit, but it’s only natural that she does reflect on that past relationship sometimes with rueful contemplation.</p><p>She swallows down the lump forming in her throat, clearing it silently. “Well then, teal can’t be green,” she says steadily. Agatha tilts her head, puzzled. “Is she colorblind? Because your eyes are the most beautiful sky blue I have ever seen. They remind me of rays of sunlight shining through ocean water, and the sapphire cornflowers I grow on my balcony that bloom in the late summer.”</p><p>Agatha breathes out shakily, peering back at the dom with an expression of faint awe, as if she has just said the romantic thing in the universe to her. When her sub opens her mouth, Rio wonders what she is about to say - something equally as poetic, perhaps, or some joke about how it’s corny for her to compare her eyes to cornflowers.</p><p>But then Agatha simply declares, “Your eyes are brown,” masking her look of satisfaction and pride with one of utter indifference. “Like dirt.”</p><p><i>Dirt?</i> Rio is forced to hold her breath to stop herself from erupting into laughter. She could have picked <i>anything</i> else; coffee, cedarwood, chestnuts, chocolate, even fucking <i>potatoes</i>, but she chose to go with dirt. “Yes, they are, thank you for that observation,” she deadpans.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Agatha says with a flashy grin, preening.</p><p>They have once again gotten side-tracked, so Rio tries to nudge Agatha back onto the correct path by reaching over and aggressively shoving her face into the sheets with one hand, while pinching her sore ass with the other, which elicits a hiss of pain, since the skin where she has been struck is extra sensitive and hot from the increased blood flow to the area.</p><p>“Getting back to your punishment, isn’t there something you need to thank me for, <i>perrita?</i>” she reminds her, yanking her collar.</p><p>The exasperated exhalation that escapes Agatha’s mouth is on par with an annoyed groan. “Thank you, sir, for the strike,” she recites. “And I deserved it because I… edited and <i>improved</i> your submission manual, but you did not approve of my notes, which you have labeled as vandalism - rude - and decided are worthy of punishment.”</p><p>The snark is returning. Rio pinches her again in gentle admonishment. “You drew doodles of <i>penises</i> in the margins, and you are claiming those are meant to help enhance the text?” she says strictly.</p><p>Agatha snorts, her voice muffled because of how her face is buried in the bedspread. “Damn, forgot I did that, I’m hilarious. I bet they were anatomically accurate enough that one could argue they were educational diagrams.”</p><p>The seventh strike stamps the amusement out of her instantly, Rio’s gloved hand flying down to land a blow on her sit-spots that will definitely make it hard for her to remain seated for any substantial period of time tomorrow, once the bruises develop. She does spank her with a little more force than before, momentarily forgetting, like an idiot, that the leather glove she’s wearing already makes each hit more painful than her bare hand.</p><p>While she maintains an emotionless expression and does not react to Agatha’s agonized cry and the way her body contorts in on itself with a shiver, the dom headspace she’s fallen into judders around her, like a house being shaken by an earthquake.</p><p>While the sadistic dom part of her is greedy and wants to hear more of those pitiful whimpers, the other side of her dom - the service dom - wants to stop and give Agatha a reprieve. She has two more strikes to ensure with her gloved hand, and then the trio with her riding crop. She’s already had a small break. They just need to get this over and done with.</p><p>The eighth and ninth strikes follow promptly, and Agatha rattles off her reasons for being punished even as her voice shakes, explaining how she was disrespectful, sarcastic, and rude, generally disobedient in and outside of sessions, and has attempted to distract Rio from carrying out her discipline.</p><p>It’s obvious from the strain in her voice that she is in serious discomfort, the two to three minute waits in between spanks resulting in the sting flaring and then fading, before the next strike bites even harder.</p><p>Rio soothes and pets her slit, playing and tugging on her labia and strumming her little bundle of nerves, so that waves of pleasure help dull the pain. At this point, the dom’s gloves are completely drenched, and Rio is both impressed and flattered, because she doesn’t think a sub has <i>ever</i> become this wet for her before, and especially not during punishment.</p><p>It just proves that Agatha is a masochist and that she was right to think that subtracting strikes from her tally was the correct way to punish her; Agatha could probably withstand another ten, maybe another twenty, spanks with ease and enjoyment.</p><p>“Last three,” Rio announces, rubbing the burn away from her last spank with a delicate palm. “I’m using the crop. It will sting a lot more when it makes an impact, but the afterburn will be less. Try not to tense too much, or thrash after the hit. Just breathe through it.”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Agatha mutters through clenched teeth, appearing to try very hard to relax, but not succeeding as her buttock stiffens beneath Rio’s hand.</p><p>Bracing for impact can help distribute the force of the blow and allow it to glance off her ass, but the heightened muscle tension that comes with bracing often leads to muscle pain and worse bruising.</p><p>Not wanting to break skin, Rio drops her leash so that it pools on her back, and strips the glove off her non-dominant hand using her teeth; she reaches down to her hip to fish out her riding crop, so she can trial how much force to put into her hit before aiming at Agatha’s sore, beaten-pink ass. If there is one thing Rio will never do, it’s skip steps when it comes to the safety of her subs - and when it comes to Agatha, she is particularly careful.</p><p>She slaps the crop’s popper onto the back of her hand until she reaches a level of force that is almost too much to bear, and she has to grit her teeth to avoid grunting in pain. Nodding in satisfaction, Rio scoots backwards a little on the mattress so that she can gently slide Agatha a little further away from her on her lap, nearer to her knees than her belly.</p><p>She would usually stand next to a prone or behind a bent-over sub to administer a strike from a riding crop, but she wants to keep Agatha close, to maintain the intimacy between them. She suspects that if she were to try and maneuver Agatha off her lap, she might panic and think that Rio is leaving again.</p><p>She raises her arm, preparing to bring the crop down onto her sub’s ass, her gaze zeroed in on the specific spot she is aiming for, in the center of her right cheek. Yet… Rio hesitates. She can’t seem to bring herself to follow through with the strike. She doesn’t even fully understand why; she just knows that she is worried. She has <i>never</i> felt this conflicted before.</p><p>“Fucking hell, are you gonna do it or not?” Agatha grouses, turning her face to the side. “The suspense is torturous. Just fucking do it.”</p><p>Rio bristles, lowering her arm to snatch up her sub’s leash alongside the crop, to jerk on it. “Don’t rush me,” she snaps.</p><p>The older woman huffs impatiently. “You’re either gonna hit me with the crop or you’re gonna chicken out. Didn’t take you for a fuckin’ wimp of a dom,” she taunts.</p><p>Chicken out? A wimp? Agatha’s ass is bright pink from her spanking, which proves that she is anything but a wuss when it comes up punishing her subs. Narrowing her eyes, Rio asks suspiciously, “Are you trying to get me angry?”</p><p>“Is it working?”</p><p>She sighs heavily, having figured out what Agatha is doing. “I’ve told you before, Agatha, I will never hit you out of anger.”</p><p>“Then do it because I’m bad and I deserve it,” Agatha replies agitatedly, shifting on her lap in a restless manner, her cuffed hands fisting the sheets.</p><p>Now that - that does <i>nothing</i> to help Rio feel better about her indecision. In fact, it only makes her feel even more torn. She will not have Agatha using self-deprecating language in an attempt to convince Rio that she deserves pain. “You are <i>not bad</i>. Don’t call yourself that,” she emphasizes.</p><p>Agatha exhales forcefully. She tries to bat her eyes and put on a falsely coy, pleading voice instead. “Please, sir, strike me with your crop.”</p><p>Well, that does nothing to help either, triggering the dom to groan and pinch the bridge of her nose with her spare hand. The sound appears to sober Agatha, who struggles to lean onto her side to better get a look at her anxious expression.</p><p>“Rio, I swear, it’s <i>okay</i>, you’ve hit me with it before,” she says seriously.</p><p>If she’s referring to the playful swats she used to motivate her into behaving and heeling earlier, then Rio has not hit her. Not properly. “This is different. Before was just taps. This will <i>hurt</i>, Agatha,” she warns.</p><p>“I can take it. I’m green.”</p><p><i>And if I’m not?</i> Rio wants to ask aloud, but her voice is so small that it remains internalizred, just a thought echoing in the back of her head, making her feel the tiniest bit nauseous. “I need to know you want this.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes bore into her, drilling down to her very soul, so overwhelmingly blue and commanding that Rio feels herself slipping into subspace just a tad, one metaphorical knee trembling beneath her. Her eyes are just so fucking bewitching, oceans that siren call Rio in to worship and submit. Lethal weapons. If wielded against a goddess, against some all-powerful cosmic being, Rio has no doubt that Agatha would have them on her knees for her in minutes.</p><p>“I want it,” Agatha asserts, her voice a deep and seductive purr that triggers Rio’s heart to skip a beat. “You don’t have to, but I don’t want you <i>not</i> to because you think I don’t want you to.” She rolls back over onto her belly and arches her back, like a cat pushing its rump into a person’s hand for scratches and pets. “Do it,” she orders.</p><p><i>Yes, ma’am</i>, is Rio’s split-second mental response, which fortunately does not break through her brain-to-mouth filter, because Agatha would never let her live it down if it did.</p><p>Pulling the shroud of her dominant persona around her like protective armor, Rio arranges Agatha back into position, steels herself by calming her breathing, and adjusts the crop within her grip. Thankfully, she is still wearing a leather glove on her dominant hand, because she knows the instrument might slip from her sweaty grip if she weren’t.</p><p>The riding crop’s pad lands on Agatha’s ass cheek with a <i>CRACK</i>. It’s so loud that it makes Rio jump, despite expecting it, and Agatha jolts as well, flinching violently and emitting a strangled howl of a sound; her sub tears at the bed sheets so aggressively that she actually slightly rips them.</p><p>The crop leaves a dark red splotch of a throbbing welt behind on her ass cheek. Rio stares at it in fascination, at the way Agatha’s gluteal muscles contract and relax, listening to her raspy, whimpering, frantic breaths as she tries to recover from the blow. Rio places her ungloved hand on Agatha’s bare lower back to help ground her, offering silent support.</p><p>She begins to become concerned when Agatha says nothing for at least half a minute, just <i>shuddering</i>, over and over again, and is just about to request a color check when the lawyer chokes out in a slurred voice, “T-ten. Thank you, sir.” She rocks from side to side, and peeling her thighs apart, which she’s squeezed together because of the burn, results in a wet squelching sound. “Oh ffffuck.”</p><p>Rio blinks, glancing down and using gloved fingers to pry her legs further apart. She’s <i>drenched</i> the anti-slip mat with her own slick, and her inflamed, sopping pink pussy is visibly pulsing, little spurts of liquid escaping.</p><p>“Did you just -” she starts in disbelief, and promptly cuts herself off when brushing her fingers over her entrance lightly causes more cum to gush out. Rio stares, wide-eyed and stunned. “Oh my god.”</p><p>Agatha just <i>came</i>. She orgasmed, from being struck with the crop. The dom can’t even bring herself to pretend to be mad at the fact that her sub just came without permission again.</p><p>And judging by Agatha’s euphoric but astonished expression, as she drags her head to the side to pant for oxygen, it was entirely unplanned. It was clearly an involuntary response to the extremely complicated but synergistic combination of pain mixed with pleasure.</p><p>That is definitely a first. Agatha is the one and only sub of hers who has ever orgasmed mid-way through a punishment. Sure, Rio’s been teasing and torturing her by fingering her the whole time, playing with her clit to drive her crazy, but she didn’t think that Agatha was <i>that</i> close to orgasm - so close that a single strike of her crop would rip the pin from the pleasure grenade.</p><p>Rio is immediately so incredibly aroused, swelteringly hot all over, with her lower belly feeling tight and twisted and full of butterflies. She is seconds away from coming herself. She is tempted to call off the spanking/whipping so she can pin Agatha to the mattress and fuck her until she herself tips over the edge.</p><p>“I can’t believe you just came,” she whispers. “Holy fuck, that was so hot, <i>perrita</i>, shit.” The last word emerges as a whine, and Rio presses her thighs together and thrusts up against her strap harness, because it’s the only stimulation she can manage to achieve for herself.</p><p>“That was… different,” her sub murmurs, dazed. “Felt… different.”</p><p>“Yeah? Tell me, pretty girl, how’d it feel different?” she urges, hope blossoming, because she thinks she already knows.</p><p>Agatha blinks slowly, as if she’s in a trance. “Didn’t feel like just… crashing and being sucked under, like usual. Normally s’like a pin being pulled from a grenade. That was sorta like… floating. Whole body just… flying off the cliff, but instead of falling into the pleasure, I just… flew.” She closes her eyes with an adorable little gleeful sigh. “I’m still flyin’ now.”</p><p>“Welcome to orgasms under subspace,” Rio chuckles in delight.</p><p>“You’re gonna punish me for coming without permission again, aren’t you?” Agatha whispers, sounding somewhat resigned and frustrated at herself.</p><p>She should. She told Agatha earlier that she wasn’t allowed to orgasm again tonight. But shit, how can she bring herself to discipline Agatha for that, when it’s the hottest thing she’s ever seen? “Hmm, well, you’re in the middle of your punishment. But you’ve submitted so beautifully during it. If you apologize, I’ll let it slide, just this once.”</p><p>Agatha hums as she says dubiously, “That’s lenient of you.”</p><p>“I’m feeling generous,” Rio responds, swallowing and trying to push down her smoldering arousal to get it under control. “I want to hear a real apology, though, puppy.”</p><p>“Urgh,” Agatha scoffs.</p><p>“Or I <i>can</i> punish you, if you’d prefer that,” Rio offers dryly, gently patting her hand over her sub’s sore ass over the rosy splotches, knowing that they will ache. “You lose any chance of coming next session.” She knows that will work as a good incentive, because Agatha’s whole enjoyment of BDSM stems from the pleasure side of things.</p><p>The lawyer looks away, burying her face in the sheets once again. For a moment, the dom thinks that she is going to remain stubbornly silent and refuse to apologize. She’ll rebel and resist her domination. But after a couple of seconds, she begrudgingly submits. In a <i>very</i> reluctant and irritated voice, she grits out, “I’m<i> sorry</i>, sir, for accidentally coming without permission during my punishment.”</p><p>It’s not the most eloquent apology ever, but it does sound sincere enough that Rio will accept it. She strokes her fingertips down Agatha’s spine, smirking at the goosebumps that arise. “Good girl,” she praises. Agatha shivers. “My wonderful sweet submissive girl.” Leaning down, she asks seriously, “Are you ready to continue? Two more strikes.”</p><p>“Yes, green, green,” Agatha breathes.</p><p>The next <i>crack</i> of the riding crop splits the air like a gunshot, landing in the center of Agatha’s ass cheek that has not yet experienced the wrath of the whip. Agatha’s screech of agony is much more guttural this time, reverberating in Rio’s ears and setting that low-burning fire of arousal aflame again.</p><p>“Eleven. Thank you, sir,” the older woman grinds out, once she has regained her breath and focus. “I deliberately sent you those photos you took of me in the middle of the day without any warning because I wanted to fluster you.”</p><p>Rio deduced that much. “You’re an annoying little shit, you know that?” she laughs. “You seem to thrive on chaos. Half the time, I’m convinced you’re actually some trickster demon or succubus witch sent to test my patience and willpower as a dom, just pretending to be a lawyer.”</p><p>“I speak Latin, so I can pretend to cast a spell on you or something if that’s roleplay you’re interested in,” Agatha says with an amused snort. “The ladykiller witch and Lady Little Death. Can’t imagine what kinky antics we’d get up to.”</p><p>“Can’t imagine both of us would make it out alive, considering your craziness.” She splays her hand possessively over her sub’s shoulder blade, swiping up her leash and pulling tentatively, to apply gentle pressure to her back. “Still green?”</p><p>“<i>Esse Viridis non est facile</i>,” Agatha mumbles.</p><p>Rio pauses, frowning. Latin. She translates it word by word in her head until - “Oh my god, you <i>did not just fucking quote Kermit the Frog in Latin</i>.”</p><p>“Hey, you only said I couldn’t <i>sing</i> it, never said I couldn’t quote it.”</p><p>The final snap of the crop against her sub’s ass is the loudest and perhaps the harshest; Agatha seizes on top of her lap and releases a gurgling cry as if a bolt of electricity is coursing through her body. She doesn’t orgasm again, but considering the way her thighs are trembling and she tries to desperately cant her hips downwards to get some contact between her clit and the anti-slip mat, she comes close.</p><p>“Oh fuck, twelve, fuck, fuck, thank you, sir!” she keens, her clenched fists releasing the torn sheets as she slumps. A beat passes, and Rio waits for her to list her final reason for deserving punishment. But it doesn’t come. Instead, Agatha moans, “Fuck, fuck. I can’t think.”</p><p>Rio sets her riding crop aside, half relieved that the physical section of the discipline is over, and the other half of her whining that Agatha <i>could</i> take more, desiring more of those red welts decorating her ass. “Come on, Agatha, you’re almost there, pretty girl. Just one more reason, your last one, why you deserve to be punished. And then you’re forgiven, and as can put this to rest,” she coaxes, massaging her sweaty scalp with her long fingers, running them through her messy mane of dark hair, and then grasping hold of her collar. “Think long and hard, <i>bizcochito</i>, make it a good one.”</p><p>As Agatha loses herself in thought, Rio hauls her up into her arms, reveling in the winces and mewls of pain that the movement elicits, because of how sore her beaten ass is. The dom eases her off her lap, and off the anti-slip mat, so she can carefully slip out from beneath her and maneuver her sub into a pose on her side, closely resembling the recovery position.</p><p>Rio caresses the length of Agatha’s naked, flushed body, admiring her now that she can see her full form again. She looks wrecked. Mentally and physically. She will undoubtedly sleep like a log tonight, because she must be completely exhausted.</p><p>Her abused cunt is still weeping, her protruding bundle of nerves pulsating and begging for attention. The nipple clamps have been clipped on for long enough, and so Rio cautiously removes them. The return of circulation back into the perky, swollen nubs causes Agatha to groan in pain, and the dom grins to herself as she rolls the reddened nipples between her fingers to restore blood flow.</p><p>She also unlocks the handcuffs, because there are deep red marks encircling her wrists now from how she has been struggling against them. The cuffs are tossed to the other side of the bed, and Rio thumbs at the inflamed skin, knowing it will definitely require some bruise balm later, during aftercare.</p><p>“Tick tock tick tock,” Rio says in a sing-song voice. “Your final reason, <i>perrita</i>, I’m growing impatient.”</p><p>“<i>I cheated!</i>” Agatha finally blurts out in a scream.</p><p>Cheated? She must mean on her pop quiz. Rio shakes her head, disappointed, sighing, “On your test? Oh, Agatha…”</p><p>“No. In California,” her sub admits. The dom blinks, lost. What the hell does Agatha mean? Fortunately, she doesn’t have to ask, because the lawyer heaves herself up into a kneeling position with a gasp. “There was a woman. A woman in the conference center bar. I - I approached her, bought her a drink - I flirted with her, knowing that you were here, knowing t-that I’d messed up during our debrief and hurt you.”</p><p>What. <i>What.</i> Rio stares. Her arousal is tamped down by a slowly building anger that she is cognizant enough of her own emotions to recognize as pure seething <i>jealousy</i>. She doesn’t have any <i>right</i> to be jealous, of course, because she and Agatha are not romantically entangled, and they are not exclusive.</p><p>They have a contract that stipulates five BDSM sessions between them, that requires regular STI testing, but there is nothing in that contract that forbids outside dalliances - whether that be between the two of them, as they explored last Monday, or with others. It was necessary for Rio as her job requires her to have sex with other clients. But it means Agatha is allowed to date, and hook up with, anybody she likes.</p><p>But the idea of anybody else touching Agatha’s body… tasting her cunt… fucking her… <i>kissing her</i>…</p><p>Rio cannot stand it. She’s suppressing her outward physical reactions to her fury, but she is on the verge of crashing out. Agatha must be able to sense her ire, because she averts her eyes. Rio growls under her breath and yanks firmly on her leash to draw her attention back, grasping her chin to force eye contact between them.</p><p>“Did you touch her? Kiss her? Sleep with her?” she snarls.</p><p>“No. No,” Agatha denies fervently, shaking her head. “She propositioned me, and invited me back to her hotel room, but… I couldn’t. It felt - it felt wrong. Like I would be cheating on you. And I know that we’re not even casual, that I’ve hired you for your services, that we are at most friends-with-benefits, I know it shouldn’t have felt like that,” she rambles. “I have no claim to you, you have no claim to me. We’re not <i>together</i>, we’re not<i> dating</i>, we’re not exclusive - hell, I know you have other clients you have sex with regularly, which I feel… <i>very</i> conflicted things about, don’t get me started on that - but flirting with her, it made me feel so twisted up. I knew I shouldn’t have done it, even as I was doing it. But I wanted to.”</p><p>That spears through Rio’s chest like a javelin aimed directly at her heart. “You wanted her?” she demands, hooking her fingers into Agatha’s collar and wrenching her so close that her hot breath in her blue eyes makes Agatha squint, looking bemused.</p><p>Now her hands are free and uncuffed, the lawyer raises them to grasp hold of Rio’s wrist, but makes no move to try and pry her hand away from her collar. A blush spreads over her sub’s cheeks, and she gulps. “No.”</p><p>Rio glowers at her, her right eye twitching. She can’t tell if she’s lying or not. “Then why did you flirt with her?” she hisses. Agatha splutters, searching for a response, and her lack of an immediate one causes very negative thoughts to flood Rio’s mind. “<i>WHY!?</i>”</p><p>“<i>Because she looked like you</i>,” Agatha cries out.</p><p>Freezing, the dom’s eyes grow as round as plates in shock. Her brain just… error 404s for a solid ten seconds of frigid silence. “What?” she eventually breathes, releasing her sub’s collar.</p><p>Agatha looks embarrassed. She smoothes her hair back, clearing her throat and tugging on the leather band wrapped around it, to loosen it a little from how Rio’s yanking of her leash has tightened it. “She - she had long brown hair, and brown eyes, and she reminded me of you, so I flirted with her and bought her a drink because - I missed you and I <i>wanted her to be you,</i>” she confesses. “I wanted to flirt with <i>you</i>, I wanted to sleep with you. You, you’re one I wanted.”</p><p>
<i>You.</i>
</p><p>
<i>You’re the one I wanted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Y O U.</i>
</p><p>Before Rio can fully understand what she’s doing, she lunges forward, tackling Agatha down onto the bed and kneeling over her on all fours, attacking her chest and breasts with kisses, and sucking and biting hickies into her skin like a raging animal.</p><p>“You wanted me, huh? So badly that you threw herself like a whore at the first dark-haired brown-eyed woman you saw, because you couldn’t stop thinking about my fingers and mouth feasting on your pussy, my hands touching your body, my voice whispering in your ear about what an insatiable <i>slut</i> you are. Is that right, Agatha?” she asks huskily.</p><p>“Yes!” her sub moans, her hands flying to Rio’s hair, combing through it and then latching on, guiding her head as her mouth simultaneously assaults and worships her body.</p><p>Rio’s lips descend the valley between her breasts to her belly, where she scrapes her teeth over the delicate skin there with a feral rumble. “You were four and a half thousand kilometers away from me, and it was only days since we last saw each other, when you practically <i>begged</i> me to fuck you into your couch. But you still couldn’t stop thinking about me, could you?” she pants, the triumph she feels utterly overwhelming and addictive.</p><p>“No! Just you, only you!” Agatha cries, throwing her head back with a shattered wail when Rio’s lips reach her mons; the dom presses hungry kisses to her bush and then envelops her entire pussy in her mouth, lashing her tongue against her entrance.</p><p>Agatha is not some prize to be won, but by turning down that stranger’s offer of casual sex, and thinking of Rio the whole time - she might as well have been wearing her collar in that bar, advertising her as an owned, loyal sub.</p><p><i>Rio’s</i> sub.</p><p>“It’s that, more than anything, that makes you <i>mine</i>,” she thunders, briefly silencing herself by taking Agatha’s clit into her mouth and sucking ferociously until she’s gasping and bucking desperately.</p><p>Rio doesn’t even care that the lawyer tries to take a tiny bit of control by gripping her hair and mashing her face against her cunt; she eats her as if she is starving, as if Agatha’s pussy is the first meal she has had in weeks. She is definitely the <i>best</i> meal she’s had, that’s for sure. Rio could eat her out for hours and not get tired or sick of her taste.</p><p>Agatha is weak and shaken, and so Rio easily overpowers her hold on her head as she crawls up her body to take in her beautiful red face. She grabs her sub’s hands and pins them above her head, grinding her strap harness up against her stomach.</p><p>“And now? I’m gonna fuck you like it,” Rio says raggedly. “I’m gonna use you to get off like you’re a fucking <i>toy</i>, and listen to you whine and bleat like a desperate little bitch in heat as I deny you orgasms. I’m gonna wring you <i>dry</i> and you’re gonna enjoy every minute of it.”</p><p>Agatha peers up at her with black eyes, her mouth open. “Do it,” she whispers. Consenting. She spreads her legs, hooking her feet behind the dom’s thighs to draw her into the cradle of her hips. “Holy shit, I’m greener than the fucking Amazon rainforest, fucking <i>do it, sir.</i>”</p><p>Bowing her head, Rio dots a small delicate kiss to each of her clavicles, one last act of tenderness before she rails the <i>shit</i> out of her sub. She sits up, taking Agatha’s leash in hand as she backs off and clambers off the bed to stand at the foot of it, pulling so that Agatha is forced to sit up too, flinching as it puts pressure on her bruised and spanked ass.</p><p>“You mostly behaved during your punishment, so go ahead and choose what position you want me to fuck you in,” she orders.</p><p>Her eyes tracking the length of her leash to Rio’s hand, and then flicking up to meet her ravenous gaze, Agatha’s lips twitch into a smirk. “Well, you’ve already got me leashed like a dog, might as well fuck me like one too, right?” she fires at her.</p><p>Doggy style, huh? Yes, Rio can certainly work with that. “Get into position and you <i>stay</i>, like a good fucking <i>perrita</i>,” she directs, pulling the glove still on her hand off and snatching up the other discarded one. “I’ll be back in ten seconds.”</p><p>Agatha is all too eager to get onto her hands and knees, and for once, Rio trusts that she will do as she is told, as she beelines to the bathroom to collect her washed and air-dried strap. She slips it into her harness’ O-ring without preamble, tossing her gloves onto the counter to rinse later. Spitting into her palm, Rio slicks up the silicone length, knowing that it’s unnecessary because of how wet Agatha already is, but feeling a tiny thrill at the idea of her saliva being used as lube.</p><p>When she returns to the bedroom, Agatha is waiting in position obediently, fiddling with the handcuffs as if they’re a fidget toy. Grabbing the chew toy gag, vibrator clip, and dog training clicker from the dresser as she passes by, she approaches her sub on the bed, quickly taking back control of her leash.</p><p>“You gonna fucking get on with it?” Agatha snipes, wiggling her ass back and forth restlessly. “I’m not getting any younger here. At this rate, I’ll hit retirement age by the time you’re inside me again.”</p><p>Rio snickers. Perfect time to gag her, if she’s going to get all snarky again. “You know what I realized? It’s always your mouth getting you into trouble. You come out with all these sarcastic barbs and biting insults. And at every opportunity, you try to sink those teeth of yours into my skin like a rabid animal.” She grabs her chin abruptly, thumb tracing her lips. “I think it’s time we muzzle you.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t make it easy. Rio can tell, however, that she is putting up a fight because she finds it fun, and it’s expected of her, rather than that she is actually protesting. Rio has to pry her clenched teeth apart to shove the chew toy gag into her mouth, and then rapidly buckles it in place so that Agatha can’t spit it out.</p><p>Agatha growls like a feral chihuahua and shakes her head vigorously, like when a dog’s prey instinct goes into overdrive, and it goes to fucking town on trying to destroy a toy. The rubber of the gag rebounds as Agatha attempts to sink her teeth into it. She yelps and startles when it makes a squeaker sound, and then hits Rio with such a venomous, enraged glare that the sub currently tucked away safe and sound in the deepest part of Rio’s brain shudders.</p><p>“Oh, did I not mention it squeaks?” Rio chuckles. Adopting the most obnoxious baby voice she can muster, she teases, “Puppy just needs to get <i>alllll</i> her frustration out, doesn’t she? Poor thing is so worked up. Just needed something to chew on to keep her bitey mouth occupied.” Smirking as Agatha glowers at her in disgust, her cheeks hot with humiliation, Rio taunts, “Maybe I should get you a set of fluffy ears and a tail too.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes dramatically, as if to say, <i>sure, hun, whatever, keep provoking me</i>, but her face turns a little bit pinker, giving away that some subconscious part of her likes that idea.</p><p>The chew toy gag is made of sturdy enough rubber that it only squeaks when it’s bitten down on super hard, which is why she didn’t discover that feature when handling it gingerly last Monday. Rio suspects that Agatha will not be chomping down on it again. The corners of her sub’s lips are stretched to the point of turning white, the gag’s straps pushing her cheeks upwards so they appear adorably pudgy.</p><p>She’s been effectively shut up. And god, is it fucking weird knowing that she’s going to fuck her sub without Agatha’s constant yapping making her cry, sigh, and giggle. Rio chooses not to handcuff her hands again, because the skin around her wrists is already irritated enough; it’s unlikely she’ll need them, though.</p><p>She presses the clicker into Agatha’s right hand. “Show me yellow.” Agatha clicks it twice. “And your safeword.” Three clicks. “Good girl. You click <i>once</i> if you get close to coming. You’ve already got away with two unpermitted orgasms tonight, but if you come without permission again, that’s three strikes - you’re out.”</p><p>What she is ultimately hoping for, which might be a little bit evil, is that Agatha will inadvertently clicker train <i>herself</i>. She will come to associate a single click with a near orgasm, and so next session, when Rio uses the clicker on her, she might be able to get Agatha right to the edge of coming with just a single click.</p><p>“Now, I have a present for you.” Rio lifts up the vibrator clip to wiggle it in front of Agatha’s face teasingly.  Her eyes dilate and grow large at the sight of it. The dom grins. She thought Agatha might like it. “I’m gonna assume that’s a ‘green’.”</p><p>Agatha nods excitedly.  If she did have a tail, it would undoubtedly be wagging.</p><p>She switches the vibrator onto its very lowest level, which creates a buzz that is so subtle that she can barely feel it against her palm. To Agatha’s already sensitive and throbbing clit, however, it will probably feel like a jackhammer.</p><p>The older woman definitely reacts as if it does when Rio reaches between her legs from behind, using her fingers to coax her clit out from its hood, and then snaps the clip in place. Her hips instantly start to convulse uncontrollably, a muffled groan ripping from her mouth as her arms give out from beneath her, landing on her elbows.</p><p>Rio springs into action, climbing onto the bed swiftly and spearing her sub with her strap in less than a couple of seconds. Agatha’s pussy is already so wet, and stretched out from having multiple fingers inside of her and cockwarming her earlier, that no prep is needed; Rio’s strap sinks in to the hilt effortlessly, sliding deep until her hips are pressed firmly to Agatha’s ass.</p><p>When she’s bottomed out, she can actually feel the vibrator clip oscillating away against the base of her harness, which feels incredible. The dom takes handfuls of her sub’s buttocks in her palms to squeeze, smiling mischievously at Agatha’s moans of pain as it aggravates her bruised flesh.</p><p>She sets an absolutely <i>brutal</i> pace, chasing her own orgasm. Agatha is silenced by her gag, but her head hangs, forehead pressed to the sheets, as she rocks back into Rio’s savage thrusts with gargled whimpers, shaking and quivering as she tries desperately to hold back from coming.</p><p>Reaching forward, Rio pulls and pulls on Agatha’s leash until she’s forced to arch her back beautifully, so she grab her sub’s hair in a ponytail in her other hand, using both her leash and hair as reins as she fucks into her like a stag in rut.</p><p>It isn’t long, maybe a couple of minutes, before Agatha utilizes the dog training clicker; she clicks once, indicating she’s close to orgasm. So Rio slows down her thrusting, changing the angle so that she no longer grazes over her G-spot.</p><p>“You wanna come, pretty girl?” she rasps roughly, her leash-holding hand hooking into Agatha’s collar to yank her upright, so her back presses up against Rio’s front. “You wanna squirt around my cock like a fucking desperate little <i>perrita?</i> A bitch needing to be bred?”</p><p>Agatha whines needily around the chew toy gag. Her cunt milks her strap, her hands scrambling for purchase but finding nothing. The answer is obviously yes. She wants to come so much she’d be willing to do anything.</p><p>Rio violently shoves her back down, forcing her face into the sheets. “Too fucking bad.”</p><p>She rams her hips forward so her strap hits deep with each penetration. Her hand slips free of Agatha’s hair for just a brief second so she can scratch her nails down her spine and then smack her hard on her ass, directly over the red marks made by her hand and crop. The pain causes Agatha to yowl through her gag.</p><p>“What you want doesn’t matter right now. I think what you need is to have the brat fucked out of you. To be fucked into submission.” She twists her hand in Agatha’s hair, jerking on it along with her leash. “You don’t get to come. Because I’m in control. You’re <i>mine</i>.”</p><p>She edges her twice more. The bed gets soaked from the combination of their slick, and the scent of sex becomes so strong that the dom reckons she won’t be able to smell anything else for days. It’s intoxicating.</p><p>Rio comes both times, pushed into delicious crescendos by the symphony of Agatha’s frantic, muted sobs and the sight of the tears that brim and spill from her stunning blue eyes - both paired with the sensation of the toy’s vibrations reverberating through her harness to stimulate her.</p><p>She makes sure to emit super loud moans of ecstasy so that Agatha knows that she’s coming; Agatha tries to turn her head to watch, appearing desperate to see her tumble over the edge, but Rio doesn’t let her, which is even more torturous for her sub, who sniffles and cries but never calls yellow or safewords. She’s just unfathomably beautiful in her submission, and it takes Rio’s breath away.</p><p>Eventually, Rio can tell that Agatha is beginning to flag and tire. Her arms have given out beneath her, and she can barely hold up her own weight anymore. She may not be allowed to come again, but to be honest, the dom’s beginning to think that’s a good thing, because she thinks one more good orgasm might knock her sub out completely.</p><p>Five total edged orgasms for the night makes a decent number, and five is an easily achievable number of orgasms for her to reward Agatha with next session.</p><p>She lessens the tension in Agatha’s leash first, letting go of her hair. And then very gently, very slowly, withdraws her soaked strap from Agatha’s thoroughly used pussy, leaving her mewling confusedly at the empty sensation. Her bemused bleating becomes more desperate when Rio turns off the vibrator clip and removes it, placing it on the bedside table.</p><p>“<i>Hhhhhnnnmmm</i>,” Agatha drones in protest, her eyes glazed over with exhaustion as she squirms, her fingers making biscuits in the sheets.</p><p>“Shh, baby, you’re okay,” Rio comforts her, rubbing her hip tenderly. “Calm. Settle. Just let me hold you.”</p><p>She plasters her front to Agatha’s back, cuddling her, her hand cupping her sub’s mound and then dragging upwards to rest over her belly supportively. She helps lower her onto the mattress, onto her side. Hasty, dextrous fingers unclip the buckles of her strap harness; she raises her hips to slip it off, casting it aside off the bed so it won’t interfere with aftercare.</p><p>Her leash is unclipped and tossed over her shoulder too, but she doesn’t risk removing her collar, not when Agatha always reacts so viscerally. What harm would it do, to allow her to continue wearing it for another hour or two, during aftercare? Post-scene dom mode activates, and Rio switches on the dime to caring less about edging Agatha to oblivion, and much more about making sure she feels safe and comfortable after such an intense session.</p><p>Comfort initially emerges in the form of affirmations and kind words. “You’re such a good girl, Agatha. You deserve all of this and more. You deserve to be loved and cared for, not <i>in spite of</i> or by <i>virtue of</i> your scars, but regardless of them. You deserve kindness, and empathy, and patience,” she murmurs softly.</p><p>Agatha responds with a low-pitched squalling sound of bafflement, curled up in a loose ball and shivering all over. Rio resists the urge to grab the bunched-up quilt near the head of the bed and drape it over her, relying on her own body heat to help warm her for now; the bath she has planned for her sub’s aftercare will heat her up much quicker than any blanket.</p><p>Rio carries on, reassuring her kisses to her neck, just above her collar. She wiggles her fingers in between the leather band and her neck to check it’s not chafing. “You are <i>not</i> a bad sub,” she tells her soothingly. “You are a survivor of trauma and abuse, and you are remarkably strong, resilient, and <i>brave</i> to have emerged from it still willing to make yourself vulnerable for the right person, someone who has proven you can trust them.”</p><p>She rakes her fingers through Agatha’s hair, inhaling and exhaling shakily. The dom squeezes her eyes shut, and decides to take a leap. Agatha is being so incredibly vulnerable with her right now - Rio can be courageous and vulnerable too.</p><p>Agatha is so wonderful. Incredible. Rio is in utter awe of her. Agatha is leagues ahead of all the subs she has ever had the pleasure of serving, in terms of her responsiveness and the satisfaction she gets from dominating her. Agatha is a challenge, she is a triumph, she is Venus in human form. The warmth that flutters in Rio’s heart for her is so profound that she feels that if she were to ever lose Agatha - not just as a client, but have her exit Rio’s life in any capacity - a part of her soul would be lost and remain snuffed out forever.</p><p>Agatha wanted Rio, last week, when she was away in California. So much so that she flirted with somebody who looked like her, and then felt immediately guilty afterwards. Because she felt like she let Rio down, felt like she cheated on her.</p><p>Rio wants Agatha too.</p><p>Wants her in so many ways it’s bewildering and hard for even her to comprehend. Doesn’t know what it means, doesn’t know how she means it precisely.</p><p>But she <i>wants her.</i></p><p>She pleads, “Let me be that person you can trust and rely on, Agatha. Not just your dominant - I want to be your friend, your confidant. I want to be your person, the one you can count on to have your back. The one you can call on to vent to, to offer you a shoulder to cry on, to help you fight your battles, no matter what. Will you give me that chance? Are you open to that?”</p><p>Two clicks. Yellow. Rio surges forward, quickly and carefully unlocking the gag in her mouth, extracting it a little slower to avoid it catching on Agatha’s teeth. She stretches her jaw, smacking her dry lips together. The clicker in her hand is thrown onto the floor like a piece of discarded trash, and thankfully not at Rio’s face.</p><p>Despite being weak as a kitten, she manages to lift herself onto her elbows before croaking, “Don’t lie to me. Please.” Her eyes are bright with hope, and yet her expression is drawn and upset, her body language tense and guarded. “I can’t - I can’t deal with a betrayal in my life again. I won’t survive it.”</p><p>“I’m not lying. I’m telling you the truth,” Rio whispers. She pushes Agatha’s hair behind her ears gently. Because that’s what Agatha needs. She just needs someone to be considerate and gentle with her. “I want you in my life as more than just my client, Agatha. Please, believe me. <i>Trust me.</i>”</p><p>Agatha bursts into tears.</p><p>She collapses, crumpling into a limp, limbless heap, face down on the bed as she succumbs to uncontrollable sobs. And because Agatha’s emotional eruption has been building for some time now, bubbling effervescently beneath the surface, Rio sighs in relief when the dam breaks; the fact that it is doing so in her presence means she can manage the fallout. She can help Agatha recover and gather the shattered pieces of herself so she can glue them back together with gold lacquer.</p><p>She gathers Agatha into her embrace, cooing softly, “I’ve got you, <i>querida</i>, I’ve got you.”</p><p>And as Agatha folds herself into Rio’s arms, shaking and crying and clinging to her as if she needs her to breathe, Rio feels a deep-set, fundamental wound buried in her psyche, that she didn’t even know she had, begin to heal.</p>
