<div class="userstuff">
<p>The entire garden is flooded with purple light. Agatha feels stronger than ever as she slowly descends to the ground. She looks proudly at Billy, who is still unsure and trying to regain his strength, although he has given some of it to Agatha. Even she herself is surprised that Billy trusted her, but what she feels now is indescribable. After so many years she's finally herself again, strong and irresistible.</p><p>"Look like you two finally on the same page," this mocking familiar voice interrupted Agatha's reverie.</p><p>"So I'll let you decide," Rio continues, "One of you stays with me..." Billy got up from the ground in fear, "...the other walks free."</p><p>Agatha knows how much Rio loves deals, but she can't go into this now. How could she, since she is no longer as vulnerable as she was. As her confidence grows, she already shapes the purple mass of light in her hands. Rio knows it's time to fight Agatha. She's been waiting for this moment for so long. With a casual wave of her hand, she sends Billy flying to the other side of the garden, who crashes straight into the greenhouse. Agatha's purple power would fly towards her, but Rio is faster and shoots her rarely used green directly at the witch. Agatha quickly blocks it, which is very unusual for her, but she knows that Rio is the only witch she can't deprive of her power. Rio enjoys the fact that they can finally fight properly.</p><p>"Power looks good on you!" Rio shouts.</p><p>Agatha laughs triumphantly. "Honey, everything looks good on me!"</p><p>Rio finds it incredible that Agatha can flirt with her even during a fight.</p><p>"Seems like you are having fun."</p><p>"Who? Me?" Agatha denies it, although she clearly enjoys it.</p><p>Due to the accumulation of anger and hatred, she throws her purple at Rio again, but she blocks it again and sends it back at her with greater force. Agatha strongly hits the ground. She feels the taste of blood in her mouth. Suddenly, a blue light fills the garden as Billy pushes Rio away, who crashes hard through the window of the house. The boy rushes to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha looks up at him sadly.</p><p>"This is futile, you know it" she starts to lose hope and is increasingly afraid of what will happen. "We can't fight Death" she sees the fear in Billy's eyes. As she looks at him, she suddenly feels that she cannot lose him.</p><p>"It should be me."</p><p>"No!" Billy begins to protest desperately.</p><p>"It should be me." Agatha touches Billy's chin with a smile, "You're not bad."</p><p>"Neither are you" the boy speaks softly but firmly.</p><p>Agatha smiles. She doesn't understand why this kid sees her differently than the others.</p><p>"You're the only one who thinks so."</p><p>Then Death returns from the ruins. Billy jumps up and bravely shouts to her:</p><p>"I'll go with you! That's my choice. Take me!"</p><p>Agatha suddenly thinks and spits out the blood that has accumulated in her mouth. She stands up and steps closer to Rio, who stands stiffly and just stares at the kid. Agatha knows she didn't quite expect this and then she sees an opportunity. Even if it hurts, this is her only chance to survive. After all, she promised Rio that. Without hesitation, she steps next to Billy.</p><p>"Take him!"</p><p>"What?" Billy's heart is broken and he looks at Agatha with such pain. He feels betrayed.</p><p>Rio is still standing still and trying to follow the events. She feels that Agatha is preparing something.</p><p>"You heard him. The boy. As promised."</p><p>Rio chuckles proudly.</p><p>Billy looks at Agatha questioningly. They make eye contact. "It's over" Agatha walks away indifferently and turns to Rio.</p><p>"And now put my yard back," she instructs. "Why don't you plant a few azaleas in your way out."</p><p>Rio doesn't answer, just gives them time to decide.</p><p>"But..." Billy follows up in confusion. Agatha slowly turns around, "I thought you were..."</p><p>"What can I say? I'm a coven-less witch" Agatha laughed with a strong mockery in her voice. She looks at Rio and walks away smugly. Suddenly she hears Billy's voice in her head.</p><p>"Agatha" his voice echoed. She stops. "I know you can hear me."</p><p>Agatha's smile suddenly melted from her face. Rio just stands there watching Agatha stop. She waits in confusion to see what will happen. She knows that Agatha loves this boy and feels that something will happen. She can feel the tension growing. After Billy is convinced that Agatha can hear him, he plucks up the courage to ask her the question directly.</p><p>"Is that how Nicky died?"</p><p>As she heard her son's name, Agatha froze and thought. It was as if time had stopped as she thought back to Nicky. She automatically raised her hand to her chest, but she only felt the place of her pendant. Now she would do another thing that she would regret later. Suddenly she thought of Rio and realized that she couldn't run away forever. At that moment, her body seemed to instinctively turn and she firmly walked towards Rio. The green witch, who had been facing Billy until now, turned her head towards Agatha with a quick movement. All she saw was that Agatha was getting closer and closer and closer to her, and then in an unexpected moment, she pulled her into a deep and passionate kiss. Rio was so surprised that at first she couldn't react, after a few seconds she realized that her old love, whom she had been trying to win back for so many years, was now standing there, holding her face and kissing it. Rio kissed back and suddenly they were both lost in the memories so much, so Rio didn't realize what Agatha was really up to. When she opens her eyes, she sees a green mist around them and feels Agatha starting to weaken. And now she knows. Agatha slowly rises, her hand sliding from Rio's face. She stares at her with tearful eyes and breathes the last remnants of her soul directly into the face of her love. Rio then remembers that Agatha said she didn't want to see her. Yet she is the last person she has seen. Rio is completely confused, but she understands why she did it. Agatha sucked some of her strength out with that kiss. Rio lays Agatha on her back with tearful eyes. She can hardly believe that this day has come. The woman she wanted to kill so long ago is no longer there, yet she feels sad and empty. So whom should her black heart beat for? Billy stares in disbelief as Rio buries Agatha's body in the ground. The sun shines directly on the flower-covered grave. Rio made sure that Agatha's favorite flowers cover it. Billy steps next to her and stares at Rio, who appears in his original skull form, with a frightened look.</p><p>"You may go" Billy takes one last look at the grave, but doesn't leave. He steps closer to the girl and asks cautiously:</p><p>"You really loved her, right? What happened between you two? I just don't understand."</p><p>Rio stares at the pile of flowers.</p><p>"Go, before I change my mind" her voice is soft, but she tries to hide her pain, since she didn't really expect this question. She changes back into her human body and falls to the ground with tears in her eyes. She knew it had to happen this way, but it still seems so impossible that it really happened. Agatha is dead.</p><p>"Please Rio. I need to know the truth" Billy tries again.</p><p>Rio sighs, then taps the grass next to her.</p><p>"Sit down."</p><p>Billy blinks questioningly.</p><p>"Do you want to hear the story or not?"</p><p>"Yes, of course. Sorry." he quickly sits down next to Rio on the grass.</p><p>"So, a long time ago, I loved someone..."</p>

<p>1720</p><p>One night in Salem, there was a big storm. Wooden houses were being battered wildly by the wind and one by one the torches burning in the village went out. No one to be seen. Everyone had taken shelter from the storm, but from one house a purple light filtered out and cries of pain filled the streets. Bodies fell to the floor. Agatha Harkness sucked in their power with satisfaction. They fought nobly, but they were not worthy of their power. Never staying long at the scene of the crime, she donned her black cloak and flew out the window, trailing a purple light behind her. She flew until she came to a small cottage in the middle of the forest. She stepped through the door, threw her wet cloak on a chair by the fireplace, sat down at the dining table and contentedly ate her dinner. This day was just like all the others. She just did what she did best. After she had eaten her meal, she lay down exhausted on her bed. The sound of raindrops on the roof soon lulled her to sleep.</p><p> </p><p>This was the way most of Agatha Harkness's days passed. It had become almost routine. Each day brought the power of a new witch. One day she was walking in the woods and heard female voices. She soon realised they were witches. She approached them and addressed them in a flattering manner.</p><p>"I am a witch too. Perhaps you could teach me some spells."</p><p>"If you are a witch, then prove it" said one of the young woman.</p><p>Agatha proudly conjured an orb in her hand, "We could start, for example, with fighting techniques."</p><p>The witches looked at each other uncertainly. Agatha already knew all the tricks she could use to draw out their power. In an unexpected moment, she pounced on them, hoping they would strike back. Of course, everything turned out as she had planned. The witches had no idea how dangerous a woman they were dealing with. In their rage they attacked Agatha and the moment their yellow power made contact with Agatha's chest, there was no turning back. Their skin began to wrinkle without their power and with screams of pain they all fell to the ground. Agatha let out a happy sigh.</p><p>"Fools" with a sneer on her face, she crouched down next to one of the women to scan her. Maybe she'd find some money or maybe a witchy object. Suddenly she heard a noise from one of the trees, and she jerked her head up in fright. Someone is here. There was no time to run or fly, so she ducked quickly behind the nearest tree. She listened with trepidation as the leaves crunched under the stranger's feet. Agatha was so curious to see who it was that she couldn't bear it, she cautiously peered out from behind the tree, but just enough to see who it was. She saw a young woman in a decorative green dress. Part of her dark brown hair was pinned up, the rest of it falling loosely over her shoulders. Beneath her hooded cloak, Agatha caught a glimpse of a knife with a wavy curve, but the person did not look dangerous at all. Her gaze was soft. Agatha couldn't take her eyes off her as she crouched down by the bodies and ran her hand gently over their faces. Agatha had never seen anything so strange in her life. She was so curious to know who this beautiful woman, but before she could get her thoughts out of her head and say anything, the secretly stranger suddenly seemed to vanish into thin air. Agatha looked around to see if she could see her, but there was no one. "I don't believe it!" she thought to herself. Was she even a witch? She didn't seem very ordinary for once, that's for sure. Agatha vowed to find out who she saw.</p><p> </p><p>Days passed but Agatha couldn't get the woman in the green dress out of her mind. What was she doing with the bodies? Why was she not frightened by the sight? Had she noticed her? All these questions kept swirling in Agatha's mind. She decided that the next time she took another witch's power, she would hide and wait for the mysterious cloaked woman to reappear. When she encountered a group of witches in the forest again, she stripped them of their powers as usual, then hid behind a tree as she had planned. Before long, the woman reappeared. She wore the same clothes and this time she did as she had done a few days before. Agatha was watching her, completely entranced, when suddenly their eyes met. With a quick movement, Agatha pulled her head back behind the tree. What should she do now? From the rustling of the leaves she guessed that she was coming towards her.</p><p>"Did you do that?" she asked quietly but firmly. "You can come out, I've already seen you."</p><p>"I didn't kill them." Agatha lied at once.</p><p>"I don't really see anything else here." the woman in the green dress moved closer.</p><p>Agatha was getting more and more tense. As if this woman knew her deepest secrets.</p><p>"Don't be afraid, it's amazing what you've done." now she was standing in front of Agatha "But tell me how?"</p><p>Instead of answering, Agatha swallowed. No one had ever appreciated what she had done.</p><p>"You're a witch, aren't you?" she asked again.</p><p>"Am I? - Agatha raised her eyebrows playfully</p><p>"Only a witch could do such a murder. Though I've never really experienced this before. How did you do it?" she asked again, her eyes scanning the bodies.</p><p>"Well, if you really want to know, I took their powers. If you are a witch then I will show you exceptional mercy." Agatha replied proudly.</p><p>She laughed softly.</p><p>"Why didn't you have mercy on them? Why should I be an exception?"</p><p>"Well, I... I don't know yet," Agatha confessed. Somehow she was different from the others.</p><p>"What is your name?" she asks, interrupting Agatha's thoughts.</p><p>"Agatha Harkness," answered firmly.</p><p>"Too pretty a name for such a witch-killer," she smiled with a lightness in her voice. "If you took away my power, you'd die."</p><p>Agatha snorted derisively.</p><p>"And I'm supposed to believe that, huh? Who do you think you are? Who are you really and what do you have to do with these dead people?"</p><p>The dark brown-haired woman just stared at her, which made Agatha feel uncomfortable. Suddenly she turned around.</p><p>"No, wait! I'm sorry. Please don't go. I need to ask you something." Agatha herself couldn't understand why she felt so attached to this woman. The woman in green turned back to her. She looked over Agatha's body.</p><p>"I've never met anyone like you before," she said. She thought Agatha was special, she'd never felt this way about anyone, but this was different. She could feel a connection to this woman.</p><p>Agatha smiled softly, "I feel the same way."</p><p>They looked at each other for a while before the mysterious person broke the silence.</p><p>"I must go."</p><p>"Wait, you're just leaving in the middle of a conversation?" snapped Agatha, "Will we see each other again?" she added hurriedly.</p><p>The woman smiled and started to walk away.</p><p>"I'm sure we will."</p><p>"Meet me tomorrow at noon by the river," Agatha called after her.</p><p>"Te veo" she nodded, and then suddenly disappeared from Agatha's sight.</p><p>~</p><p>Agatha sat on the grass by the river and waited. She tried to gather her thoughts. There was so much she wanted to ask. She lay on her back, her purple skirt spread out on the soft grass. She closed her eyes and enjoyed the sunlight. Suddenly she felt as if something was falling on her. Opened her eyes and above her stood a woman in a green skirt, pale purple flower petals falling from her palms.</p><p>"How do you do that?" asked Agatha in amazement, as she settled herself into a sitting position.</p><p>The woman pulled down her hood and sat down on the grass beside her, smiling.</p><p>"I'm a green witch. I work with the power of nature."</p><p>"So it's true, you are a witch too. I've never met a green witch before. You're a surprise," Agatha spoke in a slightly surprised but amused way.</p><p>"And what are you doing alone in the woods?" asked the green witch unexpectedly.</p><p>"Well, I have a cottage not far from here, but I live alone." replied Agatha.</p><p>"You seem to be doing quite well," she laughed, "And how long have you been doing this hunting for power? Where's your coven?"</p><p>"Wait a minute, it's not you who's asking the questions, it's me" Agatha interjected, "First of all, can you tell me who you are? And what were you doing with those bodies?" Agatha saw the face of the woman next to her become serious.</p><p>"Are you sure you want to know?" she asked.</p><p>"Of course I want to know."</p><p>"You will be frightened and you will never look at me the same way again."</p><p>Agatha put her hand on hers. It was surprisingly cold and she shivered a little at the touch.</p><p>"Look, I'm pretty messed up too, so I'm not judging. Just tell me because you're driving me crazy," Agatha encouraged.</p><p>The woman took a deep breath.</p><p>"I am Death."</p><p>There were a few seconds of silence. Only the sound of the river could be heard. Agatha laughed, but she met with a serious gaze.</p><p>"Wait, you were serious, weren't you?"</p><p>She nodded fearfully.</p><p>"So I'm gonna die now?" asked Agatha, as if she still couldn't believe what she was hearing.</p><p>"No, that's not how it works. I'm from the Afterlife and I was born at the Beginning of the Beginning. My job is claming dead souls and bring them to the Afterlife," Death began, "So that's why you cannot take my power. It would kill you."</p><p>Agatha was surprised by what she heard, but she wasn't frightened.</p><p>"Believe me, it only made you more sympathetic."</p><p>Death could not hide a relieved smile.</p><p>"I didn't know Death is this beautiful," Agatha looked her straight in the dark brown eyes. She blushed slightly. "Well, you can't complain."</p><p>"You must have another name" Agatha returned to the subject, not believing that she didn't have a proper name.</p><p>"That's the only name I'm known by," Death replied.</p><p>Agatha nodded, but vowed to herself that she would find a better name.</p><p>"So tell me, how long have you been doing the work for me?" asked Death amusedly.</p><p>"Well, I don't know since about 1692. My mother and my coven wanted to execute me for practicing forbidden magic. I killed them, but mostly in self-defense. Well, my mother, maybe on purpose. From the moment I was born, she saw me as evil, despite my best efforts to prove myself. I was never enough for her." she finished as she wiped a small tear from the corner of her eye.</p><p>"Jesus, I'm sorry, actually I don't regret it, I just..."</p><p>"Shh" Death put her index finger over her mouth. "No need to apologize Agatha. I think you're fantastic. You were brave and you survived, whatever it costs."</p><p>Ah, the way she said her name was incredible. Agatha took a barely perceptible bite of her lip. There were so many emotions stirring inside her. She felt like for the first time in her life, someone understood. And it's Death herself, it's amazing.</p><p>"So I'm a witch without a coven, because I tend to kill my mates." she joked, "Are you lonely too? Or do you have family problems like me."</p><p>"I've always been alone, no parents. I never really talked to a living person until now." Death felt she could trust Agatha and felt a bond with her. She wanted to touch her face and caress her long, beautiful hair. In fact, she'd like to touch Agatha in other ways, but for the moment, she shies away this thought.</p><p>The two witches talked until sunset. They laughed, told each other stories, had a great time.</p><p>"Would you like to have dinner with me in my house?" asked Agatha.</p><p>"I'd love to, but it's getting late and I must go," she replied.</p><p>Agatha got up disappointed.</p><p>"I'll come and see you some time tomorrow, I promise, but the souls are waiting and I must go now,." she conjured a pretty azalea flower from her hand and handed it to the witch. Agatha smiled and took it.</p><p>"I will wait for you."</p><p>"Te veo" Death beckoned and walked into the forest. Agatha still wasn't quite sure what that meant, but somewhere she felt it. She followed the witch with her eyes until she disappeared into the dense trees.</p>

<p>"Where am I? What happened?" asked a man as he looked around. He gasped slightly as he found himself face to face with Death.</p><p>"You're dead." she said in a calm voice, "But it's okay, I'll help you."</p><p>"Who are you?" he asked, confused.</p><p>"I am Death and I am here to take you with me."</p><p>The man's soul was staring at her motionless body from the outside.</p><p>"Are you ready?" she asked, and he nodded.</p><p>A green smoke-like doorway appeared behind them as the man walked in with Death at his side and within moments they found themselves in the Afterlife. They passed Death's throne and came to another gate. It was a beautiful ornate gold and the edges were covered with clouds. Death turned to the man.</p><p>"Here you will find peace."</p><p>The man did not hesitate here, he entered the gates of heaven without a second thought. Death did not even wait to enter, she would have routinely made her way back to the Land of the living, but she began to hear suspicious noises coming from a dark corridor. She nervously started towards the sounds, skulls and clouds of black smoke everywhere. Death arrived at a prison cell, where souls were locked up who were not even worthy of going to hell.</p><p>"Oh God, another one has gotten loose." she thought to herself with annoyance as she searched her mind more and more for the fact that she had been down here for a long time and knew she had promised Agatha that she would visit her today. After a few minutes of searching, Death spotted the runaway spirit on the dark cloud ceiling. She is the Lady Death, so everyone in this place obeys her, so she ordered it to come down from the ceiling. The evil soul crawled in with great difficulty, and she sent it back to its cell. Then she checked a few more things in the Afterlife, and when she was done with all the work, she hurried off to the Land of living.</p><p>The sun was almost setting behind the flowery hills. Agatha sat at the table in her kitchen and stared at the door. She felt very disappointed and stupid. She was tired of waiting for Lady Death all day. So ridiculous. It's like she's waiting for her own death. She got up and lay down on her bed, hugging her pillow tightly to her. "What was I thinking." she thought to herself. In anger and disappointment, she threw her pillow at the wardrobe. She lay sobbing on her bed for a few minutes when suddenly there was a knock at the door. Agatha immediately jumped up and opened the door of the hut. Death stood there in her usual green dress with the hood over her head. Agatha now noticed that she was not wearing any make-up and realised once again what a beautiful woman was standing outside her door. Then she remembered that she was still angry with her for waiting all day and she's not coming.</p><p>"I thought you'd never come."</p><p>Death bowed her head ruefully.</p><p>"I'm sorry, I wanted to come sooner, but..."</p><p>"How do I know you're not lying?" interjected Agatha, "If the dead people are more important to you than the living, you shouldn't have to come."</p><p>"I have a duty Agatha, you must understand. This is my job and I can't quit, it doesn't work like that. Believe me, you're more important. I'd love to spend all my days here with you, but I can't. I'm sorry. Does that sound like a lie to you?" she finally finished.</p><p>"I can't get inside your head, but you've convinced me." Agatha let out a small smile. "But you weren't here when I was waiting for you with lunch." she pouted.</p><p>"Well, I'm here now." Death took a step closer to Agatha. The air was hot between them and for a while neither of them spoke. If Agatha hadn't been attracted to her, she might have sent her away, but she couldn't. She was so happy to have her.</p><p>"It's all right, we'll eat it for dinner," Agatha nudged her, and together they entered the house. The green witch looked at the laid table.</p><p>"Oh, I see you were really waiting."</p><p>She noticed that Agatha was blushing slightly, and she couldn't hide a small smile. They sat down at the table opposite each other, and Agatha began to serve the roast meat with vegetables.</p><p>"If you don't mind, I'll just have the vegetables, I'm not so keen on meat at the moment," Death quickly indicated.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"Geez, I wait a whole day for you, cook lunch (which turned into dinner) and you tell me you don't want any?" asked Agatha, annoyed. Death looked a little startled, not sure if Agatha was joking or really mad at her.</p><p>"I'm sorry." was all she could say in her confusion.</p><p>"Oh you took it so seriously, I was joking dear." laughed Agatha.</p><p>Death just stared at her. Agatha saw the concern in her eyes.</p><p>"I didn't mean to scare you, I just..."</p><p>"No, I'm not frightened, I've just never been nicknamed before."</p><p>"Oh, really, darling?" and they looked at each other and laughed at the same time.</p><p>"Let's eat, I'm starving." said Agatha.</p><p>They began to eat and talked.</p><p>"So do you have a throne in the afterlife or what?" asked Agatha.</p><p>"Yes I do, but I don't use it much, it's more of a symbol." replied Death.</p><p>Agatha smiled.</p><p>"I have to ask, in a frustrating word, why do you always carry a weapon?"</p><p>The witch looked at the knife in his belt.</p><p>"It's Death's knife, that's why I always carry it."</p><p>"I feel threatened now," Agatha laughed.</p><p>"Don't worry, I don't use it much, except when I feel like seeing blood," Death said indifferently.</p><p>It took Agatha a few seconds to grasp what the green witch was saying and then she laughed out loud in embarrassment.</p><p>"'What is it now?" she asked, puzzled, 'You think I'm strange, don't you?</p><p>"On the contrary," Agatha began, "You're fascinating."</p><p>Death smiled and then noticed something in her neck.</p><p>"What is that? In your neck." Agatha looked at her chest.</p><p>"Oh, that?" Agatha moved her hand, "that was my mother's pendant, but I took it after she died."</p><p>"I see. And what does it represent?" asked Death.</p><p>"Three female figures. Maiden, Mother, Crone. 'It represents witchcraft or something like that," Agatha explained, as she leaned on the table and yawned.</p><p>Death nodded, "At ease Agatha, I can see you're tired. I don't want to disturb you any longer, I'll see you tomorrow." said the green witch suddenly.</p><p>"I'm glad you're here."</p><p>"It's late" she got up from the table.</p><p>"Wait! Please, don't go!" Agatha reached desperately for her hand and grabbed her wrist. Death stopped, surprised, and watched Agatha. "Please," her voice was low this time, and Death could see the concern in her eyes. "I don't want you to go. Being with you makes me feel confident and happy" Agatha fought back tears. "I feel so lonely. So lonely. I've never felt about anyone the way I feel about you," Agatha took ragged breaths and clutched her hands to her chest.</p><p>"Are you all right?" the witch asked worriedly as she squeezed her hand and sat her down on the bed.</p><p>Agatha began to cry softly and felt terrible that someone would see her like this. In all her years she had never shown herself vulnerable in front of anyone. She had been the fearless Agatha Harkness, but now here she was crying next to a woman who is Death and moreover she barely knew her, yet she was pathetically clinging to her. Death has embraced Agatha. Her hand was cold even now, but it was the best feeling in the world for Agatha. It was a long time since anyone had embraced her.</p><p>"It's all right, I'm here," she whispered softly.</p><p>Agatha sighed heavily. She could not look into her eyes, she just sat and stared in silence.</p><p>The witch spread the blanket open and Agatha slipped under it. The green witch stopped beside the bed. She didn't know what to do, it was hard for her to see Agatha so fragile, but she knew she didn't know what it felt like to be truly loved. She wanted to show her, though she didn't know exactly how she felt about her. She noticed Agatha looking at her from bed with questioning concern. At that moment, she knew what she had to do. She took off her belt and put it on a small cupboard with the knife, then untied her corset and let the big green dress fall off her shoulders and fall to the floor. Agatha, still teary-eyed, watched with interest what she was about to do. Death was now only in a thin long drapey undergarment. She walked over to the edge of the bed and slowly but confidently got into bed beside Agatha and looked at her. Agatha's big hair was spread out on the pillow, and the green witch had a lock of her hair wrapped around her finger.</p><p>"Thank you," Agatha whispered, looking straight into the deep brown eyes of the woman beside her.</p><p>Death responded with a soft smile and continued to ruffle the witch's hair.</p><p>"May I ask you something?" asked Agatha timidly.</p><p>"Anything, sweetheart"</p><p>"Would you spend the night here with me?"</p><p>Death wanted to stay close to Agatha and the last thing she wanted was to be left alone.</p><p>"Of course, but I don't really sleep. You go to sleep, I'll look after you."</p><p>Agatha was touched and moved to be closer to her. Slowly her eyes drooped, though she tried to keep them open. Incredible as it was, she felt she could trust Death, so after a while she let sleep take her. And the green witch kept looking at her face and studying Agatha's beautiful features. She wasn't tired, so she just lay on her side and listened to Agatha's breathing. She also conjured some lavender over the pillows to make sure she slept well.</p>

<p>This went on for several weeks. During the day they both went about their business and spent the evenings together, and every time Agatha woke up Death was gone, but she always came back to him later. A bond began to form between them that was uncommon. A mixture of joy, attraction and mystery. Agatha felt that Death had actually become the best part of her life and Death had never felt more human than when she met Agatha. They complemented each other perfectly. Now they were both lying on the banks of their favourite river, holding hands on the grass, gazing at the cloudy sky and just enjoying their time together and getting lost in time. Agatha turned her head towards Death and grinned.</p><p>"What's on your mind?" asked the green witch, smiling.</p><p>"That I don't know how to call you," replied Agatha amusedly.</p><p>"I understand that this is strange for you"</p><p>Agatha hardly paid attention to her, just spied the rushing river as she sat up.</p><p>Death joined her.</p><p>"Is something wrong?"</p><p>"Rio," Agatha said suddenly.</p><p>"What did you say, sweetheart?" Death looked at her questioningly and tucked a strand of hair behind Agatha's ear.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand.</p><p>"Rio. It means river. I once bumped into some travellers. They taught me a few phrases in their language."</p><p>Death held her gaze on the river, watching the water lapping against the rocks. She did not know that Agatha also spoke a little Portuguese. She was almost a native speaker. True, she was a cosmic entity, not human, but the body she lived in came from somewhere in the Spanish-speaking world. She strokes Agatha's hand wordlessly as she unintentionally grows a bed of flowers beside them.</p><p>Agatha smiles lovingly at her.</p><p>"Rio Vidal. The river of life."</p><p>Rio Vidal. She is Death and thought she could never be life, but Agatha claimed she was a river rushing into her life.</p><p>"You are Death, but I didn't know Life until we met." the blue and brown eyes met.</p><p>Agatha's honest confession warmed Death's heart.</p><p>"Rio. I like that." she said with a smile and leaned closer to Agatha.</p><p>Only a few centimetres separated them. Agatha shivered at Rio's closeness and the air between them suddenly grew hot. As Rio looked at Agatha, Agatha bit her lower lip slightly.</p><p>"You are so beautiful. I don't deserve you." Agatha's voice was full of uncertainty. Rio noticed and took the witch's face softly in her hands.</p><p>"I've never met a more beautiful girl than you, Agatha, and I've never felt about anyone the way I feel about you."</p><p>She had just finished the sentence when Agatha suddenly drew her into a passionate but soft kiss. Rio returned the kiss and they both melted into it. It was as if the surroundings disappeared and they were all that existed in the world. Then Agatha broke the kiss, pulling away enough to look up into Rio's eyes.</p><p>"I can't believe this." Agatha smiled with a sigh.</p><p>Rio looked at her questioningly.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I think...I think I love you" she finally said and blushed in embarrassment at the end of the sentence.</p><p>Rio found her charming as her face grew redder and redder.</p><p>"I love you too, my love," she said with a smile, and with her green power she pinned a tiny flower in Agatha's hair.</p><p>They lay back on the grass, filled with happiness, and Agatha laid her head on Rio's chest and took in the scent of Rio's hyacinth and for the first time she didn't feel cold against her skin. It was because of her that the warmth of love had passed through Death. The thought made Agatha smile broadly and Rio pressed a kiss to the top of her head. So they rested in silence, staring at the darkening sky, and could only think of each other.</p><p>~</p><p>One rainy evening Agatha made tea for two. The windows of the cottage were heavily battered by the wind, but inside a fire burned dimly in a hearth, providing just the right amount of warmth. Agatha was putting the kettle on when she heard a knock. She ran eagerly to answer the door. Sure enough, Rio was standing there, a little drenched. She hurried through the door and threw her cloak on a nearby chair.</p><p>"Tea is almost ready. Sit by the fire," Agatha instructed her kindly.</p><p>"I can't be cold, you know." said Rio.</p><p>Agatha slapped her hand to her forehead, "Really! I always forget."</p><p>They both sat down at the table and sipped their hot tea. Rio looked tired and didn't talk much.</p><p>"Is everything all right, dear?" asked Agatha.</p><p>"Oh, yes, of course," she said, "I'm sorry."</p><p>Agatha searched her gaze. She sensed something was wrong with Rio.</p><p>"Did something happen at work?" she asked cautiously.</p><p>Rio sighed and made eye contact with Agatha.</p><p>"I just had to take the soul of a newborn baby."</p><p>"That's awful!" Agatha squeezed her lover's hand sympathetically.</p><p>"No, it's not that. It happens a lot. A lot of babies are dying these days. It's natural for me, so I don't want you to feel sorry for me."</p><p>"Fine," Agatha let it go, not wanting to fight when they were finally together.</p><p>"I don't want to talk about it, I just want to be with you," Rio said, still holding Agatha's hand as she got up from the chair and started to pull her firmly towards the bed.</p><p>Agatha was a little surprised, but preferred to follow the witch. Most of their clothes had been stripped off, they were only in thin undergarments. Rio put her head in the crook of Agatha's neck and pressed soft kisses to it, causing Agatha to moan softly. Rio didn't want to overdo it so she pulled away a little, but Agatha didn't seem to be moving fast. With a soft movement, she pressed her lips to Rio's.  This time the kiss was more passionate than the first. Rio softly grabbed one of Agatha's breasts, which elicited another moan. Agatha pressed soft kisses to Rio's chest and neck. It felt incredible. For a while they both just sighed as they explored each other's bodies. Agatha felt like no one had ever touched her so softly.</p><p>"I love you Rio" Agatha spoke in a low, almost inaudible voice.</p><p>Rio smiled slyly and climbed over Agatha. And lower and lower...lower...and lower she began to slide down her body. Agatha gasped excitedly and began to squirm. Rio took hold of Agatha's skirt and slowly began to pull it off. Agatha didn't mind at all and helped herself out of her dress. Rio pressed soft kisses to Agatha's bare chest and kissed her body all over and then stopped between Agatha's legs.</p><p>"Let me show you how much I love you, Agatha Harkness." Rio looked up at her with a smile, but saw her lover panting.</p><p>"Rio I have never..."</p><p>"I know. I'll be gentle." she interjected softly. She knew what she meant. She could feel that Agatha was so unaffected, just as she was.</p><p>Agatha sighed in relief, closed her eyes and concentrated only on Rio's breath on her skin.</p><p>~</p><p>They both took deep breaths as they cuddled naked against each other. Agatha had never felt so happy and had never experienced such a good feeling in the last few minutes. Rio felt the same way. No one had ever touched her before. She felt that Agatha trusted her and gave herself to her, which was a very good feeling. It was overwhelming love. For the first time, she began to feel that her long life had meaning and she couldn't believe that she could bring pleasure, not just pain. She breathed in Agatha's intoxicating scent. She could stay in this embrace forever.</p><p>"That was amazing." said Agatha suddenly, her face flushed with the pleasure which Rio loved so much.</p><p>"It really was," she whispered in reply.</p><p>"I didn't know I could be soft," laughed Agatha.</p><p>"It was the best night of my life." declared Rio.</p><p>Agatha suddenly had a bad feeling. It felt almost impossible to be so happy. She was afraid that it would all go away or end and she would lose Rio. But she brushed the thought away, wanting only to live in the moment. Now she was with Rio and that was all that mattered. She felt herself getting sleepy, but she didn't want to allow her eyes to close. Rio noticed and conjured fresh lavender over the bed.</p><p>"Sleep, my love. Don't be afraid. It will be like this tomorrow and the next day and the day after that. I will never leave you."</p><p>It was as if she could see inside her mind. Agatha wanted to hear just that, muttering something half thankful as she turned to her side towards the window. She was almost asleep, but she could still feel Rio's arms around her waist from behind. The warm breath of her lover on her neck quickly lulled her into a peaceful sleep.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>One evening Rio just knocked on Agatha's door, as usual. Since the other night, it was as if she had grown even closer to Agatha. True, she arrived earlier today, but a minute or so passed and Agatha didn't answer the door. Once more she knocked a little more firmly. She began to worry, and when Agatha didn't open the door a second time, she went into the hut. Her cloak fluttered lightly behind her as the breeze caught her. To her dismay, the house was completely empty. The windows were open here and there and only furniture remained, everything else was gone. At first Rio was very frightened to see what had happened to Agatha. Had she been robbed? As her thoughts ran like wildfire, she caught sight of various flowers on the table, tied in a bunch. She knew she wasn't here by chance and Agatha had left it for her. She was so attached to Agatha, she began to feel her presence and knew she had to find her. She promised she would always return to her and she had no intention of breaking that promise. Death always keeps his word. She didn't wait any longer, he just followed Agatha wherever she went. She cut a rift in space with her knife, as she can move between universes, spaces and places, so she quickly stepped through it and felt herself getting closer and closer to her beloved. For a while all she saw was whiteness, but in a few seconds the image sharpened and she found herself in a distant forest of Salem. It was an extremely dense forest, you could barely see the stars, except here where the trees gave you a view. Rio felt Agatha's presence as strongly as if she were right beside her. She looked around as far as she could see, but all she saw was darkness. Then, not far away, she caught a glimpse of the light of a campfire flickering in the cover of some trees. Slowly he started in its direction. She hoped very much that it was Agatha, but she did not understand why she had come here. When she got closer to it, she saw that it was indeed Agatha and walked slowly towards her. Agatha was sitting by the fire, warming herself. When she saw Rio standing a few metres away with a slight smile on her face, she immediately went mad and ran to her.</p><p>"Hello darling! "You found me!" she hugged Rio, expressing that she missed her.</p><p>Rio still didn't say anything, but she found Agatha very cute.</p><p>"You're not mad at me, are you? It was so unexpected that I had to come because you know the other witches were chasing me" Agatha smiled mischievously.</p><p>"Are you that naughty?" said Rio playfully at last.</p><p>"You know, I've always been a bad girl"</p><p>Rio thought she was so sexy.</p><p>"And you have nowhere to go?" she asked, turning serious.</p><p>"It's part of my life, you know." replied Agatha.</p><p>"The running away?"</p><p>"Yes, I always kill the witches and the villagers chase me away," she said casually, taking Rio's hand and leading her to the campfire where they both sat down on a log. Rio put a blanket on Agatha's back.</p><p>"Don't catch cold," she said quietly.</p><p>Agatha smiled as she felt the care. It was a fantastic feeling that someone actually cared about her. She had never had a father because her mother had used magic to create her, as with many other witches. But she was never cared for. She hated her since birth for always standing out and always going her own way. But Rio... she loved her as she was and took care of her. She never really got attached to men. It's like all her life she'd been waiting for Rio. Returning from her thoughts, she looked into her lover's eyes and she looked into hers.</p><p>"I never dreamed Death could be so beautiful. I can't wait to die so you can take me with you. "Agatha smiled mischievously.</p><p>Rio softly stroked Agatha's mischievous, flushed face.</p><p>"You know, I'm not really that pretty..." she started hesitantly, "I mean, it's not my original shape," she explained, seeing Agatha's surprised face.</p><p>Show me!" she ordered firmly.</p><p>"I don't want to scare you," whispered Rio.</p><p>Agatha took Rio's face between both hands and ran her thumbs over the soft, cold skin.</p><p>"Listen, you're not going to scare me, my love. I'm interested in everything that you are and I can't wait to see more of you." she let go of Rio's face and slid a little further away on the log.</p><p>Rio was comforted by Agatha's words and turned away from her for a moment. Agatha didn't understand, but watched her curiously. Rio slowly began to turn around and when she came fully face to face with Agatha, she at first recoiled a little in fright. From Rio's collarbone to the top of her head, there was no flesh and skin, only bone. She didn't say anything, lest Agatha be frightened, but let her lover study her true form. Agatha crept closer to get a closer look by the light of the blazing fire. She had never seen Death in Rio, but rather just a gentle girl who was very likeable. But now that beautiful face had changed into something else. She was truly Lady Death. Her hair was still just as visible on the back of her shoulders. Agatha and Rio's eyes met. "Oh, my God, those deep brown eyes," Agatha thought, they're still the same. They radiated such immense love. Agatha gently touched Rio's cheekbone.</p><p>"You are beautiful, my love," she said softly. Her voice was full of admiration and love. She couldn't quite make out Rio's expression now "Please say something."</p><p>"Do you really like it?" she asked. Her mouth didn't move, but her words were perfectly clear. Her voice echoed slightly and sent a shiver down Agatha's spine.</p><p>"Of course I like it. You're amazing," Agatha replied, amazed.</p><p>Rio changed back into her normal human form and leaned towards Agatha. Their lips were only a few millimetres apart. And for the first time, Rio kissed Agatha passionately. She sat on her lap and bit Agatha's lower lip, and she moaned softly. Rio could taste Agatha's divine blood in her lips. She broke the kiss, not wanting to overstep the boundary, but she knew from the longing look in Agatha's eyes that she liked it. They kissed again, and Rio licked Agatha's sore bottom lip softly, the blood slowly gushing from it. The pain began to ease and Agatha felt the wound disappear from her mouth. Surprised, she broke the kiss and Rio got off her lap and grinned, kneeling down at Agatha's feet.</p><p>"How did you do that?" asked Agatha, gasping for breath.</p><p>"I can do a lot of things you don't know about," came Rio's playful reply, "and it's a long night yet," she continued as she began to spread Agatha's thighs.</p><p>Agatha looked down at Rio from between her legs and pulled her mouth into a wide smile.</p><p>"I'm ready for you to show me"</p>

<p>1730</p><p>10 years. It has passed almost as quickly as if it were yesterday. The passion in their love was still strong and every day they got to know a new side of each other. Their love was overwhelming. Lady Death and Agatha Harkness. Nothing else mattered. Rio woke with these thoughts as the morning wind beat against her skin. Slightly cold, but pleasant. Slowly, she realized she had fallen asleep a little somewhere during the night, which was extremely rare. Blinked hard as her eyes adjusted to the faint sunlight. She could smell the ash from last night's campfire. She and Agatha still didn't have a permanent home, they just roamed the forests of Salem and never stayed in one place for long. Rio was lying in the grass and when she turned around she saw that Agatha was nowhere to be found, but this time all their belongings were here. She slowly walked and looked behind every tree.</p><p>"Agathaaa," she called, in a honeyed voice.</p><p>But there was no answer from anywhere. Rio came to a nearby velvety lake.</p><p>"Come on, hide and seek... "she continued her game of hide and seek, before she caught sight of Agatha on the shore of the lake, undressing.</p><p>She curiously smiled, crept closer and stopped behind a tree. Agatha was shedding her drapey underwear, and Rio watched her fall off her shoulders and into a heap on the ground. She wasn't wearing a bra, so Rio could admire Agatha's beautiful figure. She waited until she had slipped her panties off her legs before emerging from behind the tree.</p><p>"Can't we sleep?"</p><p>Agatha immediately turned back and instinctively formed purple orbs in the palms of both hands. When she saw that it was only Rio she sighed in relief.</p><p>"Jesus, Rio, you scared the shit out of me."</p><p>The green witch grinned.</p><p>"It's strange to see you like this... I've only ever admired you in the dark," she remarked mischievously, turning her gaze to Agatha's naked body.</p><p>Agatha blinked for a moment, then laughed.</p><p>"Haha, very funny," she rolled her eyes, but after a moment she noticed Rio's gaze lingered strikingly on her. Confused, she tried to cover herself. "You're right, I couldn't sleep and..."</p><p>"Don't you dare be ashamed of me after all these years," Rio said reassuringly.</p><p>Agatha blushed and removed her hands.</p><p>"Then you're not in front of me either!" she snapped, and with a wave of her hand she removed all of Rio's clothes, then laughed loudly and started to walk into the water.</p><p>"Hey, that's not fair!" shouted Rio, also laughing, as she passed Agatha and ran into the cold water without flinching.</p><p>Agatha stood with her mouth agape as she rubbed her skin to get used to the temperature of the water.</p><p>"That was unfair," Agatha hysterically said as she slowly walked deeper.</p><p>"It's not that cold, come on!" shouted Rio with a laugh and out of nowhere a few drops of water fell on Agatha.</p><p>"Okay, what are you, a water fairy?" shrieked Agatha in annoyance, but finally with one swing she plunged into the water, just in time to splash Rio.</p><p>"I can control the four elements, didn't I tell you?" asked Rio playfully.</p><p>"No, you forgot that one," Agatha retorted.</p><p>Rio laughed and when they had both calmed down a little they swam closer together so that their wet bodies touched. They took in the scent of nature and freedom.</p><p>"You know," Agatha said, "I feel so at one with nature, with you to be precise." she put her arms around Rio and pressed a kiss to the nape of her neck.</p><p>Rio sighed softly and surrendered to the moment in Agatha's arms.</p><p>"We are one, my love" she hugged Agatha and felt her shiver. "Come on, let's go outside, it's cold," she broke the moment.</p><p>Agatha nodded. Together they walked out of the lake and back to their campsite. Rio waved her hands and a green fire flared on the log pile. Agatha shivered as she positioned herself close to the fire. Rio spread a blanket over her. True, she wasn't cold, but she had put on a thin dress so she wouldn't be completely naked.</p><p>"It is already morning. Don't you have to go?" Agatha turned to her with trembling voice.</p><p>"The souls can wait a while," Rio smiled and turned up the fire to make it warmer.</p><p>"Thank you," Agatha said softly. She felt very relieved. She really wanted her to stay.</p><p>"Rio," she said again.</p><p>"Yes my love?" she turned to her.</p><p>"We should go to the village, I'm very hungry</p><p>"We can't, they're chasing us," Rio reminded her.</p><p>"Shit! Really," Agatha was annoyed "Wait a minute...</p><p>"What is it?" asked Rio curiously.</p><p>"Make a tree or something and grow a crop on it. Can you do that for me sweetheart?" asked Agatha.</p><p>"Anything for you," winked Rio and with a delicate wave of her hand she began to grow a wild tree from the ground. Around her hands, green streaks of light curled. The tree grew and grew until it was big enough to hold many crops. Agatha reached up for a big red apple and took a bite. It was so honey sweet. She had never eaten an apple so delicious. It was just as ripe as it needed to be. Rio also plucked a small piece, took her dagger from her belt holster and cut the fruit into smaller pieces. They both took a hearty bite.</p><p>"I found the witch killer!" came a nearby shout.</p><p>Agatha and Rio looked at each other in fright and both dropped their apples.</p><p>"I can handle them," Agatha said bravely.</p><p>"Not Agatha. We have to go" Rio's firm was reply.</p><p>Agatha could almost feel the urge to have the power of these witches for herself. At the same time, she knew she didn't have to think only of herself. Rio didn't like to show herself in front of people. Even after all this time, it was hard not to get in over her head as she picked up some clothes from the ground and put some on. She still wasn't quite used to not living alone. She followed Riot through the forest. They ran together, trailed by the village witches. Agatha couldn't stand it, she had to send a purple blast of light at them. It delayed them long enough for them to escape. After much walking and flying, they reached the other end of the forest. They unloaded their belongings in the shade of a craggy tree. All day they searched for a suitable place to settle. The sky began to turn red as the sun set. Agatha slumped exhausted at the base of the tree.</p><p>"Sometimes even Death needs a rest," she said, tapping the ground beside her so that Rio could sit beside her. But she did not move and took a deep breath.</p><p>"Agatha," she started.</p><p>"I know," Agatha interjected, "I know you have to go" her voice was understanding but resigned.</p><p>Rio smiled in thanks.</p><p>"I love you, I know you understand. Will you be fine?" she asked.</p><p>Agatha smiled and nodded.</p><p>"I love you too"</p><p>Rio put on her cloak and sent a kiss to Agatha with her hand, a purple flower flying from her palm. She smiled and took it, waving to her departing lover. Rio waved back and turned back one last time.</p><p>"Te veo," she said, and in a moment she was gone from the living plane.</p>

<p>1740</p><p>The lovers found solace behind a waterfall-filled rock in one of Salem's more secluded woods. They hid their house from the rest of society. The sunlight lurking in the deep woods shone like flares, illuminating their shelter. A home they had created and built together from nothing. With the love, warmth and comfort they had longed for all their lives. Rio has always been a night owl, common with entities like Death who had no need for sleep. However, he always loved and deeply embraced every sunset, knowing that he would meet Agatha again the next day. She felt every day was a new beginning and another adventure. Rio's days were mostly boring and she was never excited about anything. That was until she met Agatha. Every morning, she was filled with the enthusiastic energy of her lover and could inject joy and spontaneity into her everyday life. Her dark blood in her black heart flowed only for Agatha. Her love for Agatha was stronger than all the power and strength she possessed. Over the years their bond grew stronger and stronger. Other witches feared them when they roamed a village. A Witch-killer and the Green Witch (who was also Death, by the way). Their aura radiated dark power. With every step they took, the power shook the ground beneath them.</p><p>They don't get any stronger than that, do they? Rio thought so a year earlier when they bonded for eternity. Agatha even joked about selling her soul to the devil. Which in a way was true. They were standing under a tree, both of them with their hands clasped together as if shaking hands. Purple and green light snaked all over their bodies. Rio asked Agatha a hundred times if she was sure she wanted to do this.</p><p>"What if our fates change in time?" she asked uncertainly. "Even after you die. Forever."</p><p>"I've already decided. I want to be with you forever, my love. Nothing can separate us," Agatha replied firmly and squeezed Rio's hand tighter, pulling her hand.</p><p>"Do you want me...for eternity?" she asked.</p><p>Rio could barely concentrate to grow a wreath of strength.</p><p>"Is that even a question?" she laughed.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as she pulled Rio so that their lips met for a kiss. Meanwhile a wreath of flowers descended on both their heads. The whole forest was covered in a mixture of green and purple light as the magic intensified. They let go of each other's hands and Rio pulled away so they could look into each other's eyes.</p><p>"You belong to me now," she said with a slight dominance in her voice.</p><p>"And you belong to me," Agatha retorted. It was incomprehensible to her that she had such an effect on Death. Part of Rio belonged to her now.</p><p> </p><p>They both sat down happily on the grass. Rio signalled to Agatha to turn around. So now her back was to her. She gently stroked Agatha's back and her beautiful long hair, then began to braid the big locks of hair. Agatha sat in silence, concentrating only on her lover's movements.</p><p>"I don't think you've thought this whole eternity thing through,' Rio said.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. I'll want you for eternity and I'll always want to be with you, understand that!</p><p>Rio laughed at Agatha's upset.</p><p>"Why you wouldn't want to?" added Agatha hurriedly.</p><p>"Maybe I just want sex for eternity," Rio continued joking.</p><p>"Sex equals me darling," Agatha replied with a grin as she turned to look at Rio, 'Besides, I didn't know you were such a pervert.</p><p>"Oh, come on! You know I was joking. Sex is just one part of it, but you're actually Agatha, your whole being that I've wanted for all eternity," she declared seriously.</p><p>Agatha didn't reply, but put her hands in her lap in a gesture of resentment.</p><p>"Still sulking, Aggie?" said Rio teasingly.</p><p>"Don't you dare call me that!" Agatha huffed and playfully threw herself at Rio, who ended up on the ground in the flowery grass.</p><p>Rio laughed and licked her lips.</p><p>"Don't provoke me here!" threatened Agatha.</p><p>"I love it so much when you're angry," she said, pushing her annoyed lover off her.</p><p>But now a small smile broke out on Agatha's face.</p><p>"I fucking love you"</p><p>"Wow" Rio laughed, moving closer to Agatha and this time adding seriously:</p><p>"I love you too. Now and forever.</p><p> </p><p>1749</p><p>Nature was calm as the trees soaked up the air after the rain and raindrops dripped lazily from each dark green leaf onto the wet ground. You could still smell the refreshed scent of nature. The forest was quiet with stillness, but small noises disturbed this peace. Agatha's feet slowly touched the wet grass as she walked through the bushes. Many mushrooms grew after the rain, so she picked them off and placed them in the small wooden basket in her hand. Agatha closed her eyes with a peaceful smile and for a moment just lost herself in the smell of fresh plants, the sounds of the forest and her emotions. She felt so infinitely happy and all these years with Rio had gone by so quickly, as if they had always known each other. She crouched down in the wet grass because she felt unexpectedly dizzy then suddenly woke up when a large raindrop splashed into a puddle somewhere in the distance. It occurred to her that she should get back to her foraging, but there was time, as Rio would probably not be here until dinner. She concentrated on the task at hand and gathered various leaves and berries. Not a day went by that she didn't think about Rio for a minute. They were like a real family without children. Motherhood probably wasn't for them. Agatha returned to their little hut in a state of endless love. She set the basket on the table and began peeling and washing the mushrooms. She began to feel stranger and stranger, and somehow she felt that she was not alone. She dropped the knife and stood watching. This feeling would not let her rest. A very strong presence, a feeling of not being alone. It was peaceful, but it was also unsettling. It couldn't be Rio, although Agatha usually felt her presence. She tried to ignore these strong feelings and concentrated on preparing lunch. Once she was ready, she sat down on the chair, closed her eyes and focused only on herself.</p><p>~</p><p>Dinnertime was approaching and Rio could get home early for once. The evening was always the highlight of her day. When she could see Agatha again. Every day she felt exactly as happy as if it had been years since she had last seen her. Each time she was greeted with the same passion and unpredictability. She simply loved every bit of Agatha. Cheerfully she opened the door and hung up her cloak in its usual place.</p><p>"Hi, darling, I'm home. Guess what, the lilac is blooming, I brought you a bunch," she said, placing them in the little vase on the table and conjuring fresh water for them.</p><p>Agatha said nothing at first but walked over to her lover, took his face in her soft hands and pressed a gentle kiss on Rio's soft cheek.</p><p>"I missed you," she whispered.</p><p>"I missed you too. How was your day?" asked Rio.</p><p>"Interesting..." she replied with excitement in her voice, "I made spicy mushroom soup. Do you want some?"</p><p>"Maybe later, now I have to..." Rio started, but Agatha cut in immediately.</p><p>"Clearly, you're tired. You need to rest" she took Rio's hand and led her towards the bedroom.</p><p>"Hey, what's all the fuss about?" she asked, laughing.</p><p>Agatha stood at first, smiling softly as she watched her lover undress.</p><p>"Freedom at last!" sighed Rio in relief as she slipped under the warm and soft blanket in her panties.</p><p>Agatha joined her. She loved the nights. All that passion... And their bed smelled so much of Rio. Her lover began to caress her bare arm. Agatha sank into it, and suddenly she sounded a delighted laugh. It was soft and terribly charming.</p><p>"What is it, Agatha?" asked Rio, searching her face.</p><p>"I don't know how to say this, I..." Agatha bit off the sentence and buried her hands in her face. Rio couldn't decide whether she was laughing or crying until Agatha began to sniffle softly.</p><p>"What's wrong, my love?" she asked worriedly, moving closer to the witch.</p><p>"I thought I was going insane, but it's not my imagination, I swear," Agatha cried.</p><p>"But what?"</p><p>Agatha took her hands away from her face and turned to Rio, smiling with tears in her eyes.</p><p>"A wonderful thing had happened. I think...I think I'm pregnant," she finally blurted out.</p><p>Rio couldn't say a word, just trying to process what she had just heard.</p><p>"But how is that possible?" she finally asked.</p><p>"I don't know, but I can feel it Rio. I had been feeling so strange for days, but I couldn't understand why. But today I realized. I feel his or her presence, you know? It's so fantastic! I never thought I'd be a mother" Agatha teared up with happiness.</p><p>"Are you sure, my love?" asked Rio, her face flushed.</p><p>"Yes. I think I am."</p><p>"That's wonderful!" Rio's eyes also glistened with a tiny tear.</p><p>They cuddled up and held each other tightly. They both thought they would never be happier. But a baby might be the thing that would deepen the bond between them even more. They don't know exactly how Agatha became fertile, but the point is, they've never felt better.</p><p>"I felt the heartbeat today," Agatha said softly.</p><p>Rio sat up in bed and laid Agatha on her back and pulled the covers off her naked body. She straddled her legs, lowered her head and placed one ear on Agatha's warm belly. After a little while, she began to hear the soft rhythm that beat endlessly in her love. A tiny sound that could change their whole lives. The one that would seal their love and theirs only. With Agatha, they both thought the same thing. That this child was born from them. Like a blessing that blessed their love. This heartbeat was the signal that their life together had just begun.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>6 months later</p><p>The last few months have been very exciting. Agatha's belly has grown and grown, and so has her happiness. Rio tried to spend as much time at home as possible and told Agatha in vain that she should stop the power-hunting and spend more time with the baby, but Agatha was adamant and could never stay still for long. Their happiness was boundless, but their relationship was becoming far from perfect.</p><p>"When the baby was born, what would happen, hm? Then you'll have to be more careful" Rio warned her one morning.</p><p>"Why? You can't you work all the time" Agatha retorted.</p><p>"My job is completely different. You do these things for revenge" Rio's voice was starting to get a little irritated.</p><p>"How interesting, you've never had a problem with it before" the witch grabbed her cloak in annoyance and stepped out of the door "Stay here and watch the house. It won't be long" with that she flew off, trailing a purple beam of light.</p><p>Rio sighed deeply. She hated it so much when they fought. Luckily, though, it wasn't often. She decided to give in and wait for her lover's return with a delicious meal. She entered the kitchen and took out the dishes and some fruit. Agatha had already taught her some techniques of cooking and baking. So she set to work.</p><p>~</p><p>Agatha returned about an hour later with renewed vigour. She could smell the plum pie from far away.  She knew Rio was only trying to help her and deep down she knew she was right about everything, she just couldn't see it. But now she was ready to put her pride aside, she loved Rio so much. She stepped through the door and looked around. The hut was very cosy as the green witch honked her horn while she took the pie out of the oven. When she turned to put it on the table she saw Agatha had arrived. She smiled and stepped closer to her.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry my love, you were right. I love you so much," Agatha admitted.</p><p>"It's all right, Agatha. I love you too," Rio smiled. She knew she regretted it. It was a big enough word from Agatha to admit it on her own.</p><p>They both ate the pie, which was delicious. Then they took an afternoon rest on the flowery grass. The sun's weak rays provided just enough warmth. Agatha lay on her back and Rio lay on her side, placing one hand on her round belly and stroking it softly. Agatha sighed softly at the touch and placed her hand on Rio's on her stomach.</p><p>"Hey little buddy," Rio playfully spoke to her lover's belly.</p><p>Agatha laughed. Then they just smiled and stared at the cloudy sky. They watched the sun's rays pierce the clouds. Rio said it looked like heaven. She stroked her bulging belly, and Agatha hummed something barely audible.</p><p>"Do you think it's a boy or a girl?" asked Rio after a long silence.</p><p>"We'll find out," Agatha replied lightly, but with excitement in her voice.</p><p>Then she closed her eyes and placed both hands on her stomach and felt them warm with purple energy. Her own power surged through her insides and she focused on the baby. Rio just watched what she was doing and moved a little away so Agatha could concentrate.</p><p>"Were you able to tune in?" she asked.</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes and smiled at Rio.</p><p>"I think he's a boy."</p><p>"Yes, now that I think about it, you're more of a boy's mum," Rio said amusedly.</p><p>"My love" Agatha spoke in a worried voice "I'm very scared. What if I won't be a good mother? What if all this is not for me? I don't want to be like my mother."</p><p>"Hey, hey don't say that" Rio turned to her "First of all, you'll never be like your mother. You're special and you'll be a fantastic mother to this little boy, I'm sure of it."</p><p>Agatha smiled.</p><p>"Do you remember the story of the little bud that had grown and next to it was a full grown flower. Her petals were very thin and she was afraid she wouldn't be able to protect the little bud from the big hailstorms. But her petals were strong. Though two of them were torn off by the wind, they always clung on with their roots and stayed with the little bud forever. There was no storm, no strong wind that could uproot it" when Rio finished, two flowers sprouted from the top. One was still in bud, the other was a full grown beautiful purple flower.</p><p>Agatha was so moved that tears welled up in her eyes. Rio plucked the purple flower and handed it to her.</p><p>"Keep it to always remember what a good mother you will be."</p><p>Agatha took it from her hand and hugged Rio. She smelled so comforting, as it always did. She couldn't put into words how grateful she was. Agatha was in a good mood again as she cuddled her lover and listened to the birds chirping.</p><p>"I don't know much about men, by the way. And I still have my doubts. He will literally be the son of Death" Agatha joked.</p><p>"Haha, very funny Ms Harkness" Rio was somehow so creative with nicknames.</p><p>"Not Mrs. Harkness?" asked Agatha, feigning indignation.</p><p>"We aren't married, or am I wrong?"</p><p>Agatha snorted, "We're bound for eternity, darling. We are even more than married."</p><p>~</p><p> </p><p>The last two months have been a little difficult, although Agatha has taken her lover's advice and spent more time at home. Her tummy was getting very big and there were occasional aches and pains, but together they were always able to work them out. Agatha was walking through the woods, out into the village. It was early morning and as usual, when she woke up, instead of Rio, she found only the empty crumpled bed. She trod slowly so as not to stumble. She began to feel more and more that her legs were getting heavy and walking was becoming increasingly difficult. The baby in her stomach was kicking hard and straining more and more. Agatha cried out slightly in pain and leaned against a craggy tree.</p><p>"Don't kick Mummy so much" she said, glancing at her tummy.</p><p>But the pain wouldn't go away and Agatha needed help. Could the baby be coming? It can't be, it's not time yet. Tiny tears were streaming from Agatha's eyes and she was starting to panic.</p><p>"Rio" her voice was weak and desperate. She needed her lover so much right now. Her calm and support.</p><p>"Please" she thought to herself as she closed her tear-soaked eyes. She just stroked her belly, trying to ease the pain.</p><p>After a few agonizing minutes, she felt a gentle but firm hand on her shoulder. Agatha opened her eyes hopefully at that moment, but it wasn't Rio.</p><p>"Can I help you, madam?" the older woman asked.</p><p>"Leave me alone!" snapped Agatha. The woman was surprised, but said nothing, just stared at her.</p><p>"Please just go away!" added Agatha desperately.</p><p>"Excuse me, but you need help."</p><p>"I'm fine, I said leave me alone," Agatha repeated more firmly.</p><p>"Wait, I'll call for help..."</p><p>"Please leave. My Institute."</p><p>Agatha was very relieved to hear Rio's voice. The green witch ran to her lover crouched at the base of the tree.</p><p>"What happened, my love? What hurts?" she asked quickly.</p><p>"Help Rio, please," was all Agatha could say.</p><p>"Agatha, what happened?" asked Rio again with concern in her voice.</p><p>"I don't know, but it's really tight," she replied.</p><p>Rio put one palm on her lover's big belly and with his other hand he squeezed Agatha's.</p><p>"Look at me!"</p><p>Agatha met the deep brown eyes with difficulty.</p><p>"It will be all right, I've reduced the pain now. You just breathe a lot, okay?"</p><p>The witch nodded and began to take deep breaths. In a few seconds the pain began to ease thanks to Rio's magic. Agatha exhaled and lay down at the base of the tree.</p><p>"Thank you" she whispered.</p><p>Rio smiled at her, but stared at her stomach for minutes. Agatha was suddenly struck by a wave of fear as she looked at Rio's inscrutable face. She had such a strange feeling, something overwhelming and terrible. It was as if it wasn't her Rio standing before her, but someone else entirely.</p><p>"What's wrong?" asked Agatha suspiciously.</p><p>Rio snatched her gaze from Agatha's stomach.</p><p>"Nothing, I just... I had a strange feeling."</p><p>Agatha felt something was wrong. As if the wind had changed. She couldn't get her lover's gaze out of her head as they walked side by side in silence towards their hut. Something was coming, something dark. And Rio could feel it too.</p>

<p>1750</p><p>Agatha ran. As far as she could, hunched over under the weight of her pregnancy. The pain tore into her with every step. She never thought the love that had once been her life would now be her undoing. In recent weeks, Rio had changed. Colder. More distant. With the first pangs of labour came the realisation: it was as if she was trying to take away everything they had built together. When she no longer felt safe with her lover, she began to run away. She didn't think. She just ran. Like a wounded animal being chased by a hunter. A hunter she loved perhaps even more than herself. Who had once been her whole world. When she reached the shore of the lake, she stopped. Her body protested against running, the pain seared into her bones. She leaned against a damp tree trunk, half the lemon falling from her trembling hands, which she pulled out to concentrate on the birth. But now nothing could distract her from reality. A figure loomed in the distance. It was familiar. Too familiar. Rio stood there in her usual green dress, holding a white flower. Agatha didn't see her lover in her this time. Not the woman who had once been her home, not the woman who had given her life, not Rio Vidal. It was Death. Death, who had come for her son.</p><p>"No, no!" Agatha's voice broke in despair.</p><p>Death has moved closer.</p><p>"It cannot be" Agatha could not believe that this was really happening to her.</p><p>For a moment Death's features seemed to soften. As if she was writhing and pained by what she was about to do. But when she spoke, her voice was cold and emotionless.</p><p>"It must be"</p><p>"You do this and I will hate you forever!"</p><p>Something in Rio's heart was broken. Agatha's words cut into her like a blade. She was the only one who mattered, the only one who had ever truly mattered to her, and now she could lose her. Her love. Their child together. Everything.</p><p>"Please let him live, please, my love!" Agatha wailed desperately this time, but she didn't demand it. She pleaded.</p><p>"My love" That single word was enough to make Rio falter. Her eyes filled with tears and she closed them to hide her pain. Agatha kept repeating, "Please, please, please." Rio's heart was breaking. But the rules...The rules allow no mercy. Never. Yet, somewhere deep down, she knew she couldn't do it. Not with Agatha. Not now.</p><p>"I can offer only time" she said finally, her voice trembling.</p><p>"How much time?" Agatha could barely suppress her gasping screams, "How much?"</p><p>But when she opened her eyes, Rio was gone. The pain had become unbearable, but it was nowhere near as intense as what she felt deep inside. It was nothing compared to that. Agatha's body tensed as she gathered her last reserves of strength and finally gave birth to the child. Her screams were swallowed by the lake and the world fell silent for a moment. Then she heard the crying. The cry of her own son. Exhausted, she took him in her arms and her heart filled with an overwhelming love she had never felt before.</p><p>"Hi" she said, her voice full of joy "I spoke no spell. I said no incantation" she whispered in disbelief, "You...you were made from scratch.</p><p>Agatha's tears had fallen, but now they were tears of happiness. She hugged the little one close to her. His small body was warm, his tiny hands clinging to her hair, his little feet touching the fabric. In that moment, she knew that this child was more important to her than anything else. Just now she felt she had lost everything, now everything was hers. She leaned her head against the tree, exhausted, and sighed happily, giving thanks for this moment. The child's tiny lips found her breast, drops of milk falling on the bloody drape of cloth. Agatha's eyes slowly closed, but her arms held the boy tightly, as if she still feared someone would take him from her. The moment was perfect. The happiest moment of her life. She was determined that whatever the cost, she would never let anyone take it away from her.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The damp forest. The overwhelming wave of pain. The shadow of Death. These images flashed before Agatha's eyes again and again, as if haunted by a never-ending nightmare. A bitter weeping dragged her back to reality. In the silence of the cottage, sitting at the table, the child Agatha had named Nicholas Scratch was stirring restlessly in the wooden cradle beside her. A few weeks had passed since the birth and Rio had not returned. Agatha gently took the baby boy in her arms and began to rock him slowly.</p><p>"Shhh, it's okay... I'm here. It's going to be okay," she whispered as her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>Rio's absence confused her, and what hurt most was that she still longed for her. She longed for her lover's touch, for her comforting closeness, but she also hated her for almost taking away what had now become the most important thing to her. Agatha held the little boy close to her and they cried together, like two broken souls carrying the same absence, the same pain. Her tears fell down her baby's cheeks, and her dress was soaked through her chest as it filled with Nicholas' painful tears. When the crying slowly subsided, she fed him gently. Her movements were full of love and fear. The baby finally calmed down and stopped crying, only a soft, unsteady whimper, as if he too was trying to accept the world he was born into. He looked at Agatha and reached for her hair to touch it. Those eyes... God, they looked so much like Rio's. Perhaps a shade lighter, but still the same eyes looked back at her. It was as if she'd bathed in Rio's gaze again. It was a heartbreakingly familiar feeling. She leaned over the cradle, letting her long wavy brown hair fall over the little boy. Nicholas touched a lock of hair and for the first time a small happy smile appeared on his face. Rio was in that smile too. Agatha didn't know how it was possible, it hurt, yet it was beautiful. She began to hum softly until she heard the steady breathing of the little boy. He was still gripping her hair insistently and she couldn't take her eyes off him for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>In the distance, a sad pair of eyes peered through the window. Rio had long watched them, watched them silently, but dared not do what her heart longed to do. She couldn't go back. How could she? She hurt those who were more important to her than anyone else. She never wanted Agatha to interfere with her job in any way. Yet it happened. It was simply an inevitable tragedy. Or at least it should have been by the book, but Rio broke the law and overrode everything just to avoid a fatal loss. It was all she could do. Giving the child time was a once-in-a-lifetime event in history. Agatha should be grateful, yet she hated her for it and Rio was unable to look her in the eye after that. Maybe Agatha doesn't even think about her anymore. She walked closer to the house and looked through the window. She could almost see them lying in bed together with their son, happy, not a thread of hatred, just endless love. But instead she saw a broken, lonely witch, exhausted from crying all day. There was no one to comfort her. Rio felt the urge to reach out and say, "Here I am my love, I'm sorry. Everything will be okay, I promise." But she couldn't do that. Not yet. Agatha needed time. Maybe one day she'd forgive her.</p><p>Meanwhile, her lover walked back into the room with the baby in her arms and disappeared from sight. Rio wiped a tear from her cheek and backed away from the window.</p><p>"Te veo" she whispered sadly, then melted into the silence of the night.</p><p>~</p><p>Agatha was haunted by fear as she roamed the forests of Salem. She still couldn't stay in one place and had to leave her once warm home behind the waterfall. In her arms, Nicholas whimpered wearily. Only the starlight provided a path in the dark night. Agatha was barely on her feet, so exhausted from her long escape, but she dared not stop for fear that Rio would come and take her son away relentlessly. But she couldn't walk any longer. She threw her cloak down on the soft cold grass and lay down. She wrapped Nicholas in a swaddling cloth and held him close. Tired as she was, sleep would not come. And his little boy began to cry again. He did this every night and Agatha couldn't understand why. She tried to rock him, but she was fed up. Nicholas had cried a lot in the last few weeks. Maybe he can feel the pain. A bigger wind came up and Nicholas suddenly stopped crying. Agatha looked up and saw the little one looking off into the distance, interested. Agatha didn't look back, she just lay still and held Nicholas even closer. She knew very well what was happening. She could feel it in the wind and could not mistake whose familiar presence it was.</p><p>"Are you here to take him?" asked Agatha, almost resignedly, as she felt her heartbeat quicken and tears begin to well in her eyes.</p><p>"I just wanted to see you. And him" Rio replied tersely.</p><p>Agatha's heart was now clenched tighter than ever, partly from the momentary relief, but at the same time she had never heard Rio so broken. Nicholas laughed and reached out with his tiny arms towards Rio. Agatha pulled him even further away to get as far away from the green witch as possible. She heard Rio's pained sigh and sat up on her cloak, still unable to turn to her former lover. Rio stood watching them for a few minutes, then without a word she sat down on the grass with her back to Agatha, who shrank back in fright at the contact. Rio could feel Agatha's body heaving as she took in agitated breaths. She just desperately wanted to return to her and their son. Tiny green flames emerged from her hands, dimly illuminating the forest. Some flew towards little Nicholas. The boy reached out eagerly, but Agatha tried to keep him away from the green witch's magic.</p><p>"I can't even hold him" Rio said disappointedly, staring into space.</p><p>"No until..." Agatha begun.</p><p>"I know" Rio interrupted quietly. Agatha needs more time.</p><p>Both of their hearts sank. Nicholas is not just Agatha's son and they both knew it. After a few minutes of agonising silence, Agatha couldn't take it any longer. Desperate to escape the pain. Escape from Rio.</p><p>"Please go away!" was Agatha's firm statement, "I don't want to see you," she added when she felt Rio not move.</p><p>"Please Agatha..."</p><p>"NO!"</p><p>Rio flinched as Agatha shouted at her. She had never spoken to her like that before.</p><p>"You'll wake him up," she said in an indifferent tone as she glanced back at the now asleep Nicholas.</p><p>"What do you care? 'If it were up to you, he wouldn't be alive" Agatha retorted, but it hurt her to say every word.</p><p>"It was up to me to keep him alive," Rio's voice was un teasing and she tried not to show emotion "It was the only way"</p><p>To Agatha, her lover's words were a terrible truth, but she was unable to admit it. She only knew that Rio had taken everything from her.</p><p>"I won't say it again, go away! I don't want to see you!" her voice trailed off at the end, eager to be together again. She knew that she had hurt her very much. Rio stood up slowly, stifling her tears. She moved further and further away.</p><p>"Te veo" her voice was barely audible as she waved goodbye to her family. She didn't go away completely, but didn't come any closer. She only watched wistfully from a distance as her lover quietly cried herself to sleep.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>4 years later</p><p>The sun was shining brightly on the lawn next to the forest. Agatha was picking herbs and edible berries in the forest. Nicholas was playing on the lawn. He didn't cry when he fell, but laughed as the mud covered his trousers. Agatha smiled as she watched the little boy jump up and run into the bushes as if following someone. Agatha had never seen these bushes before. They were covered with simple little flowers that reminded her of something she had long forgotten. Or maybe she just wanted to forget. But Nicky didn't turn up for too long. A long-ago fear had been rekindled in Agatha's heart. She hurried quickly to the lawn.</p><p>"Nicky! Come out!" she called as she ran. She could hear the boy's soft speech, but no other sound.</p><p>In a few seconds the cheerful little boy came out of the bushes.</p><p>"Who were you talking to, sweetheart?" Agatha asked.</p><p>"With the flower" Nicky answered with a smile.</p><p>"Flowers can't talk" Agatha said.</p><p>"But she can" Nicky said, and put a yellow petalled flower into Agatha's hand.</p><p>She stopped. Her eyes scanned the garden, but she saw no one. Nicky had just turned four. She must have been talking to an imaginary friend. Magic was pulsing somewhere, but it wasn't powerful or hostile. Perhaps that's what really frightened her.</p><p>~</p><p>The next day, Nicky was back playing with the flowers, and Agatha was sweeping the yard in front of their cottage. The boy ventured further and further away until he reached the edge of the woods. Agatha didn't notice, but kept her mind on her work. Nicky followed the flowers, which led to a huge clump of petals. The petals suddenly stirred in the air, and with them Nicky's feet lifted off the ground. The boy laughed uproariously. Agatha noticed the laughter  and somehow she sensed that her son was not alone. She hurried in the direction of the sound, but when she got there, all she found was Nicky, sprawled among the flowers. She looked around, but again saw no one.</p><p>"Mom, Mom, I flew!"the little boy shouted and ran to her.</p><p>"You flew? How is that possible?" asked Agatha, frightened.</p><p>"The flower petals flew me up," said Nicky happily.</p><p>A suspicion that had been growing in Agatha's heart for a long time was confirmed. Could it be possible? No, she must not give way to that thought.</p><p>"Are you all right, mom? - Nicky asked, tugging gently at Agatha's skirt.</p><p>"Of course honey" she replied with a smile. She softly took her son's hand and they walked back into the house together. All these flower things were driving her crazy. Why was Nicky so fond of them? He is a boy. Another thing that made him so much like Rio. Every time she thought she'd finally forgotten her, Nicholas would remind her of something small.</p><p>~</p><p>When night fell and Agatha put Nicky to bed, a purple flower flew in through the bedroom window. It was just like the one Rio had given her when she was pregnant, a symbol that she would be a good mother. Agatha's heart pounded as she stepped up and touched the flower with trembling hands. Then the all-too-familiar voice she hadn't heard in years rang in her head:</p><p>Don't fight against it, Agatha...</p><p>She dropped the flower in horror and threw it out of the window with a pained heart. Will Rio come for Nicky? Agatha's fear, which had been flattened over the years, resurfaced and would not let her rest. She was becoming more and more certain that the flowers were not just any flowers, the voice was not a dream and Nicky was not talking to her imaginary friend.</p><p>~</p><p>One day, Agatha went briefly into the nearby woods to look for witches. She left the cabin for only a few minutes. But when she returned, Nicky was nowhere to be found. Her heart was pounding, as if squeezed by an invisible hand, and despair flooded every part of her. Maybe Rio had already come... and taken him with her. She cried out her son's name in a breathless rush into the forest. She had almost given up hope when she heard Nicky's angelic laughter, but she wasn't alone. She heard another. It came from a woman. Agatha stopped. The sound that reached her ears was so familiar it almost hurt. It was Rio's laughter, playful, sweet, nothing threatening about it, and it pierced Agatha's heart like a dagger. Slowly, carefully, she crept closer. When she saw them, she realized the voices didn't lie. Rio was sitting on the grass with her son. Agatha stepped out from behind a tree but the crunch of grass betrayed her approach. Rio froze.</p><p>"Nicky, what are you doing?" asked Agatha in a harsh, muffled voice.</p><p>"Mom, she's my friend! She won't hurt me!" the boy replied cheerfully.</p><p>Agatha's eyes met Rio's again after all these years. She saw no threat in her, only fear and longing.</p><p>And what are you doing here? - she asked sternly.</p><p>Rio slowly stood up and took a step back.</p><p>"I just wanted to see him and you Ag..." she began softly.</p><p>"Don't say my name!" Agatha interrupted, her voice harsher than she felt inside.</p><p>Nicky blinked, puzzled.</p><p>"Sweetheart, go back to the house," Agatha asked, gently stroking her son's head "I'll be right there."</p><p>The little boy obediently started back. When he was far enough away not to hear them, Rio spoke.</p><p>"Here we go again?" she asked quietly "Are you sending me away again?" There was a careless lightness in her voice, but disappointment could not be hidden.</p><p>"There's nothing else I can do" Agatha's stern voice rang through the trees "I can't let you near him again"</p><p>"But she seemed to remember me. As if... he were calling me"</p><p>"That doesn't give you the right to do anything" Agatha's voice was not very angry now, much to Rio's surprise. As hard as she tried, she couldn't hide her longing.</p><p>"Maybe not,..but I couldn't stay away from you any longer," Rio replied sadly.</p><p>Agatha felt an invisible lump in her throat. She missed her former lover so much.</p><p>"Please Agatha, don't push me away!" Rio pleaded as she stepped closer, tears welling up in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip to hold back the tears that were about to burst.</p><p>"I wish we could be a family again..." she whispered, "But we can't. I can't let you. It will never be the same."</p><p>"I know...but we can try" Rio said, touching her lover's cheek gently.</p><p>Agatha didn't look up, she was staring at the ground, but she felt the tiny flame that flared in her heart again at Rio's touch. Perhaps it was not too late. She just had to give way to it. Tiny tears appeared in Rio's eyes as she held her gently. She had watched them from a distance for so long, hoping that one day they would have a chance to fix all that had gone wrong. The pain of the past had broken them both, yet hope still flickered in the depths of her black heart. She couldn't bear it if Agatha pushed her away again.</p><p>"Let me go back... my love" Rio begged gently.</p><p>After all, Nicky deserved to be happy while he still could. After a few seconds of thought, Agatha finally looked up from the ground.</p><p>"Fine" she whispered, her words floating on the wind.</p><p>Rio leaned closer. Only a few centimetres separated them. It was painfully familiar. Agatha sighed, as if relieved herself. They both closed their eyes and melted into the moment as their lips instinctively pressed softly together. A mixture of tears coated their mouths and the salty taste drew them both in, towards a doorway of hope whose key was now in their hands.</p>

<p>The following days were happier than ever. Agatha once again allowed herself to get closer to Rio. She could see she was trying so hard and it made Nicky so much happier. They played together, cooked, went on trips and everything was just like in their dreams. Rio didn't really put much effort in just going with the flow making the most of every minute of time she had with her family. Nicky was sitting outside the house watching Rio make flowers in the garden and Agatha was watching them cook through the open window. She also let out a small smile.</p><p>"Nicky! I've made some fruit," Agatha waved, and the boy ran to the window and took the bowl of fresh fruit, then sat down on the stairs and began to munch.</p><p>"Thanks, mommy"</p><p>Rio winked at the eager Nicky and walked into the house. Agatha turned her head away but sensed that Rio wasn't taking her eyes off her so she looked up cautiously.</p><p>"Let me help" Rio said, taking the knife from Agatha's hand to start chopping the vegetables for lunch.</p><p>She was careful not to approach her lover, lest she spoil everything. Agatha watched her wife's soft movements for a while, then sighed.</p><p>"What's wrong, my love?" asked Rio.</p><p>"Don't... call me that" Agatha replied in a hushed voice, almost a whisper.</p><p>Rio's eyes reflected pain and disappointment. She swallowed. Agatha could see she was trying to speak and was prepared for the question.</p><p>"Don't you love me anymore?" she began, her eyes filled with tears, so afraid of the answer. She couldn't bear it if Agatha meant it. She couldn't let go after all they had been through together. The tension was building to a climax.</p><p>Agatha's words caught in her throat and she didn't know exactly how she felt about Rio. She took a breath, but before she could speak she heard the angelically innocent voice of their little boy as he entered the kitchen.</p><p>"I ate them all" he said cheerfully, holding the bowl out to his mother.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, choked with tears, and took it from the little boy's hand. Nicky ran to Rio's side, took her hand and started pulling her towards the door.</p><p>"Come play with me!"</p><p>Rio was frozen, but she didn't want to be in this awkward situation any longer and she couldn't do it to Nicky. She smiled at the boy and didn't even glance at Agatha. Together they left the house, leaving the witch behind. Agatha just stood there like a statue listening to the playful noises, but she didn't want to lose sight of Nicky, so she watched them through the window.</p><p>"Mom, we're going for a walk. You must come too!" the little boy came in a few minutes later and ran to her.</p><p>Rio stood in the doorway and watched as her lover kissed the boy.</p><p>"Please let us go!"</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio.</p><p>"I don't mind, but let's be back by sunset"</p><p>"All right then, let's go on a great adventure!" cried Nicky enthusiastically.</p><p>Together the three of them set off into the dense forest. Agatha and Rio put their worries aside and concentrated on each other and their beloved son. They played hide-and-seek in the trees, played tag, laughed and everything was perfect. Too perfect. The three of them sat on the grass and Agatha braided Rio and Nicky's hair. And the little boy decorated their hair with different flowers. Rio's hand found Agatha's, but to her surprise, she didn't pull away. Nicky noticed the connection between the two women and wanted answers.</p><p>"Mom, do you love Rio?"</p><p>Agatha froze for a moment, but still held Rio's cold hands. She could feel the tension and fear on her.</p><p>"Yes Nicky...I love her" she said the words as if they were stone hard, but she felt relieved and as much as she tried, she undeniably loved Rio. She couldn't have told Nicky any other words. She heard the sigh of relief from the green witch next to her, though she wasn't sure if Agatha was telling the truth or if it was just because of Nicky.</p><p>"Sweetheart listen to me, I know I always said I was the only one for you, but the truth is Rio is your other mother" Agatha watched the glistening eyes glance back at her.</p><p>"Really?" he asked in amazement.</p><p>"Yes, and we both love you very much" Rio finally spoke and their eyes met again.</p><p>Agatha smiled and tucked a strand of hair behind the green witch's ear. She was afraid Nicky would keep asking questions, but luckily she could live with that statement.</p><p>"The sun is about to set. Come on, you should be in bed soon Nicky" said Agatha.</p><p>"But I'm not sleepy!" said the boy defiantly.</p><p>You're not? Hmm really?" Rio giggled as Agatha put her hand on her hip, "Now run back to the house!" shouted Agatha playfully and began to chase the boy amusedly.</p><p>"Mommy no!" laughed Nicky and ran all the way to the door.</p><p>The witches ran after him and when Agatha caught up with him, she picked him up and tickled him. Nicky laughed uproariously.</p><p>"It's incredible that even at 4 years old, he can run like a rabbit," Rio remarked, panting, when she caught up with them.</p><p>"All right, you win" Agatha said to the boy, who smiled sleepily, "Now, go to bed!"</p><p>"I won't sleep unless Rio accompanies me" he declared.</p><p>Rio looked questioningly at her lover, as if asking permission. After a moment's thought, Agatha nodded. The green witch took the boy in her arms and headed for the bedroom. She gently tucked Nicky into his bed. Agatha leaned against the doorjamb and watched the moment with rapt attention. Rio tucked him in and stroked his head.</p><p>"Good night" she smiled playfully.</p><p>Agatha moved closer and kissed Nicholas on the forehead.</p><p>"Sleep well sweetie"</p><p>"I love you, Mommy" he said sleepily and wrapped a lock of Agatha's hair in his hands. He always loved to do that. Ever since he was a newborn.</p><p>"I love you too, very much" whispered Agatha.</p><p>Rio blew out the candle in the room and together they walked out of the room. The moment the door closed, Agatha took Rio's face in her arms. Her eyes were full of intense emotion. The green witch leaned closer to the crook of Agatha's neck and pressed a small soft kiss to it. The witch groaned at the long lost touch, but she was alert and gently pushed away.</p><p>"Not here" she whispered with hidden desperation.</p><p>Rio glanced at the door to the room behind her. Obviously Agatha didn't want their son to hear them. Wordlessly, she started down the small corridor towards another door. Rio followed slowly, but her lover did not tell her to follow. When she entered, she saw that Agatha had already taken off her dirty clothes and changed into her nightgown. She couldn't see much in the flickering light of the dim candle. Rio stood in the doorway, and as much as she wanted to, she dared not come nearer. It was only then that Agatha noticed and appreciated the witch's stay. She was obviously confused by what had happened earlier in the day. She smiled softly, but Rio didn't notice. She sat down on her bed and considered. She didn't know if she could possibly take Rio back in this way, but she could see her effort and she longed for Rio's closeness so much that she couldn't think straight. Damn it. Agatha sighed again and glanced at her wife, who was pacing in the doorway.</p><p>"Come in" the words were harsh and full of desire.</p><p>Rio slowly entered the room and began to remove her clothes. She didn't know exactly what Agatha's intentions were, but she did what she thought was right. She motioned for her to take off all her clothes and tossed over a nightgown. Rio picked it up and sat down on the edge of Agatha's bed.</p><p>"What will happen now?" she said after an agonizingly long silence.</p><p>"Not what you expect" Agatha replied soothingly.</p><p>Rio swallowed. She must have misread the signs.</p><p>"I can leave then"</p><p>Agatha snapped her head up.</p><p>"No!" her reaction was perhaps a little too quick "Stay" she was quite ashamed, but now she had exposed herself.</p><p>Rio seeing her wife's reaction, was emboldened and began to approach more spectacularly. It was always easier when Agatha was in a more sentimental mood. They crawled into bed and lay on their backs together in silence.</p><p>"Agatha" Rio said, turning her gaze to the witch "Would you tell me what will happen to us now?"</p><p>Agatha could not escape the painful truth this time. She obviously still loved her very much, but she would never forget what had happened at Nicky's birth. That emotionless look. At the same time, she wondered how adorable Rio had been these past few days and she really felt happy, even if for a short while. The feelings were piling up as she smelled Rio's familiar wild scent, the warmth of family and the desire for more contact. Her heart was beating fast and she could no longer contain herself. She jumped up and in a sudden movement she was in Rio's lap. The green witch laughed in surprise and reached for Agatha, but she grabbed her wrists and pinned them to the bed.</p><p>"You said it wouldn't be what I expected" Rio remarked, her lips pulling into a lively grin.</p><p>"Well, I guess you weren't expecting this" Agatha replied amusedly.</p><p>Rio licked her lips.</p><p>"I missed you Agatha," she said, turning serious, "Please stop torturing me."</p><p>Agatha softened and let go of her lover's wrists and rested her head on her chest. She took in the scent of Rio. She could smell the mixture of so many flowers on her and a slight smoke. It was almost the smell of family. Her heart was beating fast in that non-human heart.</p><p>"Damn, I missed you too" her chin was still on Rio's chest, but her eyes were on her the whole time. She reached up to touch Rio's small breasts, who gasped but didn't break eye contact.</p><p>"I love you, Rio Vidal" Agatha said, almost in a whisper, and Rio now knew she meant it. Tears almost came to her eyes with relief. Agatha rolled up her nightdress and kissed her warm belly. It was so soft and loving.</p><p>"I love you too Agatha Harkness" Rio finally said in a voice more sincere than ever.</p><p>For the next few minutes they thought nothing of the worries and difficulties ahead. They just lost themselves in their love for each other just as they had done before. But something was different. Their dream life was too good to be true and they couldn't quite forget it. Agatha had never really wanted anything but these moments that she could experience now and today. But at the same time they both knew that happiness was only temporary and that everything would go wrong. They didn't know how much time they had left, and fear was slowly taking over, but their love for each other was stronger for now.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Maybe a month has passed. Everything was so perfect. When Agatha went on a power hunt, Rio looked after Nicholas and everything seemed to fall into place. But still something in Agatha's soul stirred uneasily. "I can offer only time" Rio's words echoed over and over in her head ominous, like an approaching storm cloud. She didn't know when the moment would come, but she felt it approaching. She watched Rio all the time and looked for signs, but saw nothing suspicious. Rio turned to Nicky with love, doing nothing to cause fear. And yet, Agatha's dreams were filled with darker and darker images.</p><p>One afternoon, she was washing up in the house, almost lulled by the trickle of water and the play of lights, when it suddenly struck her: it was too quiet. She couldn't hear Nicky's voice. Her stomach immediately twisted. She immediately thought the worst and ran out into the yard. Rio grabbed Nicky's hand and pulled him further and further away from Agatha. Instinct took over. She did not think. She just felt her son was in danger. They were both running and she didn't know what was happening, the mother tiger just came out. Purple formed a magic ball in one hand and aimed it straight at Rio, who flew forward about five feet. Nicky stumbled as the green witch dragged him along hilariously. Agatha ran after them and rushed to her little boy's side. Rio scrambled up off the ground, annoyed.</p><p>"What the hell is wrong with you?"</p><p>"What were you going to do with him?" asked Agatha hurriedly instead of answering.</p><p>"For God's sake, we were just playing" Rio raised his voice.</p><p>"Don't fight!" Nicky shouted, frightened.</p><p>The two witches ignored him and continued their chatter.</p><p>"It wasn't funny. I think you should play with him less" Agatha glared at Rio as if she had put her thoughts in her head.</p><p>"Why?" asked Nicky.</p><p>"Never mind sweetie, let's go back to the house." said Agatha.</p><p>Rio gave Agatha an annoyed look and they walked back together. Nicky went to his room for something and Rio immediately turned to her lover.</p><p>"I'm sorry you got scared. I didn't mean to take him, just stop it."</p><p>"You have no idea how it feels" Agatha's eyes were piercing "...that I don't know when it's going to happen."</p><p>Rio didn't answer but reached for Agatha's hand, but she pulled it away.</p><p>"I will keep an eye on you Vidal!"</p><p>Rio's eyes widened at the last name. It sounded as if Agatha was her boss and she wanted to instil fear in her heart. It was so typical of her that when she was afraid, she tried to make others afraid. She restrained herself and just nodded. They stood silent for a few seconds as Rio conjured a flower and handed it to her lover. Agatha closed her eyes and took it softly. She knew that with Rio it meant apology. Nicky came back and clung to Agatha's leg.</p><p>"Mom, are you all right?' the little boy asked worriedly.</p><p>"Of course Mommy's fine" she smiled forcibly. She picked Nicky up and hugged him tightly, glancing coldly at Rio, who moved closer and stroked the boy's head.</p><p>~</p><p>As time went by, Agatha became more and more tense and would no longer leave her son alone with Rio. The nightmares intensified and she began to feel again, as she had in the past, that she was not safe with her lover. This feeling was followed by Rio's appearance in the forest during the birthing process. Agatha was so terrified of this sign and at any moment her son could die. She barely spoke to Rio and tried to keep Nicky away from her. She knew she was hurting her lover by doing so, but at this point she didn't care. There was only one thing on her mind: She had to do everything she needed to do to keep her son alive.</p><p>It was evening and Rio was putting Nicky to bed in the nursery, and Agatha was sitting at the table, staring at herself. She couldn't see things through. Fear was really getting the better of her. When Rio smiled and returned to the kitchen, she could see in Agatha's face that something was wrong. She sat down at the table opposite her.</p><p>"Tomorrow we could go to the village. Nicky said we need a farm animal" Rio tried, but saw that Agatha wasn't paying attention.</p><p>"No" she said at last, still staring at the floor.</p><p>"It's okay, we can go another day" Rio continued.</p><p>"No Rio" Agatha looked up. She had already made her decision.</p><p>The green witch looked puzzled.</p><p>"I want you to go. This is the end" Agatha's voice was husky and uncontradicted.</p><p>Rio's heart was beating fast.</p><p>"Please don't do this!"</p><p>"Yes, I am, and I'm doing it for my son."</p><p>"You mean for our son" Rio clarified in an increasingly strained voice.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and snapped.</p><p>"It's over Rio. I can't take it anymore. When you're near him I feel terrible and I can't make such a mistake by not sending you away now!"</p><p>"We'll work it out together, you can't do this to Nicky" Rio was sounding more and more desperate.</p><p>"You are unpredictable. But I know what's good for him."</p><p>"You should be grateful, Agatha. But no, you're tearing our family apart instead. Well, you know that's not what's good for him. Don't do this just because you're scared!" Rio got up from the chair.</p><p>"Yes I am scared, I'm terrified" Agatha sat up too "If you really cared about Nicky and if you really cared about me, you wouldn't have done this! Then you would be afraid too."</p><p>"Agatha that's his fate you know that. I'm not afraid because death is the natural order all things."</p><p>The anger and pain that had been building up in Agatha burst to the surface at once.</p><p>"Now leave! And don't come back!"</p><p>"Please don't do this, Agatha. Please think! Fear blinded you..."</p><p>"Don't you dare say this to me!" Agatha was screaming "Don't make me out to be evil when you're the only one to blame for all this! I will not let you see him again!"</p><p>Tears welled in Rio's eyes, but she didn't let them go. Agatha turned around to hide her weakness. Her heart was pounding and tears were streaming from her eyes. She swallowed to speak clearly.</p><p>"I'm going to turn around now and I suggest you're not here by then" her voice was threatening. She closed her eyes. Slowly she turned around and opened them.</p><p>As she demanded, Rio disappeared without a trace. Now she couldn't even feel her presence. And then she released herself. She crouched on the ground and felt a pressure in her chest. She put her hands to her heart and began to cry softly. Meanwhile Rio, somewhere in space, was doing the same. Agatha's words haunted and hurt her. She felt terrible. Sadly, she took her place on the throne of the afterlife. She didn't know herself when she would have to take Nicky, but already the thought made her sick.</p><p>~</p><p>The next morning, the little boy ran happily into Agatha's bedroom. He was shocked to discover that Rio was nowhere to be found. He crawled into bed with Agatha and shook the covers.</p><p>"Mom, mom where is Rio?" he asked urgently.</p><p>Agatha was still half asleep, but with great difficulty she turned to Nicky and cleared her throat before speaking.</p><p>"She is gone, sweetheart. Shes got other things to do" she tried to say in the most casual tone.</p><p>Nicky cuddled up to his mother sadly. Agatha spread the blanket wide for the little boy to crawl under. As she opened the blanket, it still smelt of Rio. Agatha inhaled and sighed deeply. Relieved, she held her son to her and whispered in his ear:</p><p>"I'll never let anything happen to you. Everything will be all right now" she was mostly reassuring herself and Nicky smiled at her. His little smile reminded Agatha of the time she'd held Rio in her arms in the same bed and she'd looked at her with the same smile. But that was a long time ago.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha and Nicholas were in the woods of Salem. Again, they had no permanent home. Agatha really wanted to avoid Rio finding them this time. It had been a year and luckily she had not returned since their separation. They headed for a village, as it had been a long time since Agatha had access to another witch's power source.</p><p> </p><p>"Where are we going, Mom?"asked Nicky, distracted.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, we're going on an adventure" Agatha replied playfully. She didn't want to say that by adventure she meant killing witches.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The boy smiled enthusiastically. When they got to the village, they bought some vegetables and meat and a goat for livestock. Agatha had already observed and sensed in advance who among the women might be a witch. They stopped in front of a house.</p><p> </p><p>"Honey, stay here for a while. Mommy will be right back" and with a sly smile she pushed through the door.</p><p> </p><p>Soon after, Nicky heard screams and purple light filtering through the windows. Agatha returned refreshed and ran straight to her son.</p><p> </p><p>"All right, we're done here. Now let's keep moving" she didn't want him to get suspicious and she didn't want to stay long at the scene of the crime, lest Rio find her. She knew it would give her a better chance of meeting her, but she didn't care. She just wanted to regain her strength.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>For a while they walked silently side by side and Agatha began to worry that Nicky might have overheard what had happened. She avoided the subject and brought up something else instead.</p><p> </p><p>"Would you like to name him?" she asked, nodding towards the goat.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes! Let's call him...Scratchy" the boy replied amusedly.</p><p> </p><p>"Scratchy?" Agatha really didn't understand, but it sounded funny.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>"Well, after my name. Nicholas Scratch" the boy explained.</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, now I get it" laughed Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>As the sun began to creep down from the sky and they were still walking, Agatha had a great idea.</p><p> </p><p>"Nicky, listen, would you like to help Mommy with something?"</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>"What?" he asked curiously.</p><p> </p><p>"Next time we go to a village, I need you to distract some witches and lead them to me. Do you think you can do that? You'd be a great help to Mommy" Agatha thought the plan was brilliant, now that Nicky was more grown up he could help her.</p><p> </p><p>"I think I can do it" said the boy, a little hesitantly.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>"That's my boy!" encouraged Agatha, and the boy smiled faintly.</p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p><em>"Down, down, down the Road. Down the Witches Road. Down, down, down the Road. Down the Witches Road. Follow me my friend, to glory at the end"</em> Nicky's voice rang out beautifully in the woodland pub. He was six years old now and this song they'd written together had grown on him.</p><p> </p><p>The pub was full of witches and they were just doing their usual thing, like every day. Everyone clapped after the song.</p><p> </p><p>"Bravo, child! Astonishing!" shouted Agatha as she clapped her hands loudly for the other witches to join her "How astounding! Here, take your fee. And others, reward him for his talent!" she winked at Nicky and dropped a coin into her little basket. Several others followed her.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>"Young boy, wherever did you come upon with such a curious song?" asked a younger girl.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky didn't answer, just felt dizzy for a moment on top of the barrel.</p><p> </p><p>"Come, let us find you a warm meal" said the girl, helping him down from the high ground "My sisters and I can help you."</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, but no" Nicky turned to her "My mother needs me home" here she glanced at Agatha and ran out of the pub.</p><p> </p><p>There was something in that look. Something very disturbing. At that moment, Agatha realised that perhaps Nicky didn't mean her by "mother" this time. Her heart skipped a beat.</p><p> </p><p>"Nicky! Nicky!" she ran out into the meadow, frightened, and called her son's name. She was secretly relieved to see her son on the bank of the stream, throwing stones into the water.</p><p> </p><p>"Mama!" he said softly, rubbing his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>It was getting dark, and Agatha stepped closer to him through the stones without a word.</p><p> </p><p>"We can kill more witches tomorrow" the boy said again, tiredly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha still said nothing. Nicky was acting suspiciously. He was a little annoyed with her for running away so suddenly. She couldn't understand why, but her son obviously had no idea how much he'd frightened her. No, he couldn't have known that.</p><p> </p><p>"I promise" Nicky insisted, sitting down on a blanket and coughing.</p><p> </p><p>He looked up fearfully at Agatha, who was staring at him with a stern expression. Why was he coughing? Agatha had only just noticed how pale he looked. Terror overcame her for a moment, but she did not show it, only looked at her son's bright face. She softened and pulled her lips into a soft smile, and Nicky smiled mischievously back.</p><p> </p><p><em>"Marching ever forward..."</em> Agatha playfully pretended to pace "<em>Neath the wooded shrine..."</em> she slowly sat down "<em>I stray not from te path. Hold your hand in mine"</em> Nicky smiled as they shook hands. Agatha continued "<em>What's gone is gone, we carry on...Always. Forever"</em> Agatha paused and urged Nicky to join in <em>"By your side"</em> Now their voices could be heard together with the rustling wind of the forest and the trickling of the stream. Agatha smiled lovingly at her son, whom she loved so much. Then they sang on as Nicky went to bed and she tucked him in.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Down, down, down the Road. Down the Witches Road. My blood, my tears, my bone...Maiden, Mother, Crone"</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Now they both lay facing each other and Nicky picked at Agatha's locket. He looked tired, but he was still smiling. Agatha stroked his cheek softly and pulled her mouth into a wide caring smile. She kept stroking him and pushed his hair out of his face. Nicky coughed some more, then slowly closed his eyes and the smile disappeared from Agatha's face. Something was wrong. It took time for her to stop stroking, but Nicky never opened his eyes again. Agatha watched her son's features for a long time and watched him, listening to his little sobs. It wasn't long before she was lost in sleep too.</p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p>Nicholas awoke to a dimly lit light in the middle of the night. His mother was fast asleep beside him. He lifted his head and slowly looked back. He caught a glimpse of a familiar figure in the distance, holding a torch with the green glow of a fire covering part of the forest. The moment had come. The moment that would ruin everything. Rio lowered her hood and waved gently at the boy, careful not to startle him. Then she waved her finger for him to come closer. Nicky stood up and started to go, but Rio stopped him and pointed to Agatha to say goodbye. The boy stepped back and planted a kiss on his mother's cheek, then started walking towards the green witch again. Rio took him by the hand and they walked towards the green smoke gate in the distance, crossing the wooden bridge over the stream.</p><p> </p><p>"Where are we going?" asked Nicky curiously.</p><p> </p><p>"On an adventure" smiled Rio. It was hard to say, but she hid her pain.</p><p> </p><p>"And why can't Mama come with us?" came another question.</p><p> </p><p>Rio's heart ached at Nicky's blankness. Apparently unaware that he was no longer here in the flesh. But she couldn't tell him that, she said:</p><p> </p><p>"You know, this is your journey alone. One day your mother will follow you."</p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly, Nicky didn't ask any more questions, but Rio knew he remembered her from when he was little. The boy began to sing softly and looked at his feet.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Down, down, down the Road. Down the Witches Road..."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio's thoughts merged with the melody and she didn't want to look back. She knew this day would come, but she hadn't expected it to come so soon. It will break Agatha's heart. She didn't even dare think about how her lover would feel when she woke up to find her son dead. She would hate her forever from now on and she knew it. Which was a terrible feeling. Rio felt like she was a time bomb waiting to go off and when she did she would leave nothing but destruction and suffering in her wake. At the same time she knew that she, as Death, was the natural order of all things. Just not everyone saw or accepted this. Nicky's voice jerked her back to reality.</p><p> </p><p>"My mom and I used to sing it when we went on adventures" his voice was low but free. It was typical of most new souls.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn't answer, for then they arrived in front of a cloud of green smoke.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you ready?" she asked softly.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky nodded and to Rio's surprise he was not afraid. He was not aware of what was really happening. After all, he was just a kid who really did see it as an adventure and had nothing to worry about. But he squeezed Rio's hand a little more firmly and together they stepped through the gate of the Afterlife.</p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"I have always known. This Road is cruel and wild. I bury my own heart, here with you my child. If one be gone, we carry on. But every mile I go. With every bend, beyond the end. Your mother loves you so."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood weeping at her son's grave. The overwhelming wave of grief washed over her for minutes. She could still see last night and Nicky's beautiful face. The moment he closed his eyes, Agatha knew something was wrong, but in her worst nightmare she had no idea that was the last moment she would ever see him. She couldn't even say goodbye. Death was crueler than she thought. She was only given 6 years. Agatha would have needed much more time. She was not ready for this terrible grief and pain.</p><p> </p><p>"You must know the way, then?" A young woman's voice suddenly called to her.</p><p> </p><p>"How dare you? Who are you?" Agatha shouted angrily at her.</p><p> </p><p>"Forgive me. I thought you may know the way" she apologised.</p><p> </p><p>"A way to what?" asked Agatha indignantly, wiping her tears.</p><p> </p><p>"The Witches Road. You know the Ballad. Might you show me the way?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her, thoughtful for a moment, but then she had an idea. After all, she deserves some reward. That's all she deserves after what happened to Nicky. It was the perfect plan. She smiled broadly.</p><p> </p><p>"You inquire in good faith. So I shall respond in kind. Of course I'll show you the way to the Road. I know it by heart. First, we must gather a coven" she replied with a wicked smile.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>1 year later</p><p>Agatha has drained a lot of her coven powers with the help of the Witches' Road lore and a slightly rewritten ballad. She gained the power of another witch team. This time Rio came for the souls and could not avoid this unpleasant encounter. She took on a new form: instead of her usual green robes, she wore a black dress with a hood over her head. When Agatha caught sight of her, anger immediately flared inside her and she was ready for battle.</p><p>"I've been cleaning up after you a lot nowadays" Rio remarked.</p><p>"How dare you come in my face after what you've done!" snapped Agatha, her eyes blazing with anger. Though she had taken the lives of countless people recently, she didn't care for a moment.</p><p>"You know I had no choice" Rio said irritably.</p><p>"I hate you!" shouted Agatha "And I will never, never forgive you!"</p><p>Rio swallowed. Every word hurt, but injustice always made her angry.</p><p>"It's not my fault you didn't take the time you had with him!"</p><p>"Six years! Do you realize how short that is?!" Agatha was in a rage.</p><p>"I really didn't want this" Rio began.</p><p>"What do I have to do to get him back? I'll do anything!" Agatha's voice wasn't pleading, it was more like a challenge.</p><p>"There's nothing you can do, Agatha" Rio replied, a neutral yet pained expression on her face. She wish it were possible.</p><p>Agatha thought desperately, then saw an opportunity, the only way out that might still be left. She had to try.</p><p>"I have a suggestion. A deal."</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow in interest.</p><p>"You have power over the dead. Bring him back!" Agatha pleaded, for the first time with real pleading in her voice.</p><p>"I can't just bring someone back to life..." Agatha sighed hopelessly "But..." Rio continued, "if you give me your soul, I can bring him back."</p><p>Give her soul to Death? Agatha no longer cared. All that mattered was that she had a chance to see Nicky again. Whatever happened, she felt it would be all right.</p><p>"Deal" she said firmly.</p><p>"If that's what you want. Shall we go then?" asked Rio, quietly but sadly.</p><p>"Wait, what? Where?"</p><p>"You gave yourself up. Just like our deal said."</p><p>"Oh well..." Agatha thought "I think we've misunderstood each other a little."</p><p>"That was the deal" Rio started to raise her voice  "And you initiated it."</p><p>That's when Agatha realized. Death wants to take her soul. The agreement was indeed that, but Agatha was not fully aware of the consequences when she agreed. She kept trying to escape the situation.</p><p>"I gave my soul to you! Now bring Nicky back!" Agatha took a few angry steps back. She knew very well what was coming.</p><p>"No Agatha! Giving up your soul means you have to die so he can live! A soul for a soul" Death explained.</p><p>"Come on, then! What are you waiting for? Why don't you take me?!" shouted Agatha, spreading her arms.</p><p>Rio laughed awkwardly.</p><p>"You don't seem to understand. The deal has created a bond between us. I cannot kill you unless you give yourself up willingly."</p><p>Agatha smiled mockingly.</p><p>"Then you've lost, darling! 'Because I'm not going to take myself to grave" she threw in defiantly.</p><p>"If you break the deal, there may be serious consequences!" Rio warned as a sudden purple beam of light suddenly flashed towards her. But she jumped aside, her anger growing. Agatha began to flee, then flew up into the air.</p><p>"You think you can just trick me?!" Rio shouted after her "We had a deal, Agatha!"</p><p>Agatha flew at high speed, but Rio didn't give up. She summoned a huge wind that blew her out of the sky. Agatha hit the ground, but struggled to her feet, panting.</p><p>"You can't break that deal!" Rio's voice flamed with anger.</p><p>"Let's just say I've changed my mind" Agatha's mouth curled into a wicked smile.</p><p>"Are you really such a coward?! You think you can do anything?" snapped Rio. "Then know this: no one plays games with Death!" Her voice was icy and harsh, like nothing Agatha had ever heard.</p><p>"Oh, but I thought you love to play games" she sneered, and seized the opportunity to shoot a beam of light. The shot hit Rio in the chest and struck a thick tree. Agatha then immediately untied the wheel.</p><p>The green witch searched furiously for a while longer, but finally lost her trail completely. Agatha completely destabilized the balance. And Rio wasn't going to let it go.</p><p> </p><p>1772</p><p>For years Rio searched for Agatha with anger, bitterness and pain in her heart. She felt betrayed. The grief she had carried for years was slowly turning into hatred. She hated Agatha for ignoring the laws of nature and death. The deal that might have allowed them to have their son back had been broken for good. It was their only chance, and Agatha's selfishness took it all away. Rio was also angry with her because she blamed her for Nicholas' death, even though she was not the only one to blame. Still, she didn't give up. Quietly, determinedly, she searched until she finally found her at the edge of a wood where she was doing her usual thing. Rio heard the screams, then the gloating laughter. When the sounds died away, she stepped out of the trees. Her long black dress rustled as she followed her every step.</p><p>"You're predictable" she said indifferently, and Agatha threw her head back in fright.</p><p>"Well... it took you a few years to find me anyway."</p><p>Rio was so angry at Agatha's sarcastic reply and it showed on her face. This time she took the initiative. She sent a strong gust of wind towards the other witch, who hit the hard ground as there were only a few trees nearby. Agatha pushed for the climax. She conjured a purple orb in her hand and hurled it with great force towards her former lover. She felt so strong she thought she could fight death. Rio, however, dodged the shot but did not hit back. Agatha, however, kept bombing. Her words gave each shot a painful power.</p><p>"I trusted you! I loved you! And you took everything from me!"</p><p>"You take everything from others! Haven't you ever thought that the witches you kill every day have families, huh?" shouted Rio, and this time she fought back. A large green beam of light flew straight at Agatha, who dodged it with a deft move.</p><p>"I don't give a shit about the others! All I cared about was my son!"</p><p>"You had a chance to bring him back!" shouted Rio back.</p><p>A fight of incredible depth and pain and hatred ensued. Rio was too strong, but Agatha wouldn't give up. She pushed her against a tree, and before the green witch could think, Agatha had wrapped purple vines around her and lifted her up into the air. A cruel grin spread across her face. Rio was gasping in the air.</p><p>"And now..." Agatha's voice was slow and menacing  "You will suffer. Exactly as I suffered!" she finished the sentence with a squeezing gesture, tightening the magical bonds around the woman in black.</p><p>Rio cried out in pain. Even though she couldn't die and she can heal her physical wounds, she could still feel pain. She didn't think Agatha would actually hurt her. Something inside her broke through, something deep and uncontrollable. With a single burst of power, she shattered Agatha's spell. The witch fell to the ground and Rio drew her dagger and held it to her throat.</p><p>"You can't defeat me! It's useless to try" Rio's face was impassive, but her eyes were still glowing with anger.</p><p>"Don't worry, I'll figure it out somehow" Agatha retorted sarcastically, pushing the witch off her back.</p><p>"I tried to be nice at first," Rio's voice was threatening in Agatha's ear "But you left me no choice. If you don't give yourself up willingly, I'll have to handle it!" she made a quick gesture and started waving her dagger at Agatha, who was momentarily startled and tried to duck the sharp blade.</p><p>Desperate, she started to run into the woods, but as if pulled back by an invisible hand. She braced her palms on the ground and tried to grab hold of something as Rio's magic pulled her along. She ended up at Death's feet, her disheveled hair covered in leaves and her clothes covered in dirt. She scrambled up as fast as she could and started to run again, but Rio grabbed her arm.</p><p>"Where, where?" she asked mockingly, swinging the hand that held the dagger and slashing at Agatha's upper arm, who cried out in sudden pain and collapsed to the ground.</p><p>The wound was not very deep, she had cut it just enough to make the blood gush out. Rio watched Agatha, the blood gushing from her arm, the pained moan... Something stirred inside her, but she didn't show it openly.</p><p>"You can't kill me" Agatha panted, resistance in her eyes.</p><p>"I know, darling," said Rio, then smiled as she held up Agatha's chin with two fingers, "But I can make you suffer."</p><p>Agatha jerked her head away and looked up in puzzlement, then sat up.</p><p>"Come on, you know that doesn't make sense" she tried.</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha's blood-soaked upper arm and knew she'd overshot the mark a little, but she didn't openly admit it. Agatha was no longer ready for a fight and didn't look like she wanted to fight back. Rio stepped closer and grabbed her arm again where the bleeding wound was.</p><p>"Ouch! Are you totally insane?!" Agatha exclaimed, but then Rio suddenly pulled her towards.</p><p>She could feel Agatha's panting breath, her familiar scent, and realized that part of her was still the same woman she had once fallen in love with. Agatha felt it too, and her gaze wandered to Rio's lips.</p><p>"I hope you know now who you are dealing with" Death said coldly "Te veo Agatha" she added, and then released the witch's aching arm and walked past her.</p><p>Agatha groaned at the momentary throbbing pain, but when she looked the cut had completely disappeared under Rio's hands. She looked at her arm in amazement and couldn't understand it. She never thought Rio would ever hurt her like this, when she had once been her lover, her everything, her world. She would prepare for Rio's next return and not let herself lose again. A powerful dynamic between attraction and hatred has begun, and the battle is now won by Rio. But the war will be won by Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>1820 Switzerland</p><p>Agatha left Salem and with her America. She kept on the run, not wanting anyone to find her, and here she found larger covens of witches. Snow covered the whole forest, and Agatha walked around very heavily dressed to track down other witches. She found them in a cosy stone house in the hills and did her work with wind speed: one witch death, one powerful spell. In the crisp, cold air, when Agatha was done, Rio was there, watching in the background, with the dark magical weapon in her pocket that she always carried when she was gathering souls. The work was formal in a way, but as they both pursued their goals, the atmosphere grew tense. They were two adversaries who, although they didn't trust each other, were engaged in an endless game of magic and it seemed like only yesterday they had parted. Of course, fifty years was a short time for witches of such longevity.</p><p>"Hello, Agatha!" Rio's eerie voice filled the warm house warmed by the fireplace.</p><p>Agatha stopped suddenly, a step ahead of Rio. The rush of air momentarily interrupted them both as Agatha remarked with a half smile:</p><p>"Doesn't it feel good to grow a little stronger with every soul.... But what will you do with these souls once you have them?"</p><p>Rio replied with a slight smile, her dark gaze calmly watching Agatha.</p><p>"Souls don't matter, Agatha. The only thing that matters is another step towards power. And you? What is your purpose now? Another witch on the list of victims?"</p><p>Agatha pondered for a moment, then raised her head, a glint in her eye that Rio understood.</p><p>"My goal is to control everything... and that's what brought me here. But is that what you want, Rio? The domination of souls or something else?"</p><p>Rio laughed and took a step towards Agatha, but didn't touch her. The whole moment was filled with a palpable sexual tension between the two witches, something they both knew but would not let go. Behind the flirting, the taunting, there was a desire for power and a feeling that they both wanted to dominate each other.</p><p>"Do you have nothing better to do?" asked Agatha, bored.</p><p>"I've only just got here" Rio blinked innocently. Agatha had only just noticed that this time she looked more ordinary than she had ever seen her before. Rio was wearing a thick dark corseted dress and a hat, with a dishevelled bun tied at the back of her head. The other witch could not take her eyes off her.</p><p>"Someone is very fashionable" Agatha observed.</p><p>"You don't look bad either" Rio looked Agatha over, her eyes catching on her long braided hair.</p><p>"I'm busy right now. Leave me alone and go about your business" Agatha said, sitting down by the fire to warm herself.</p><p>"We are like two padlocks tied together baby! The trouble is, neither of us has a key to our own. Our fate and our destiny are forever entwined and it's no use to escape, my love!"</p><p>"Don't call me that!" interposed Agatha.</p><p>But Rio, as if she had not heard her, came slowly towards Agatha.</p><p>"Come on Agatha, you know why I'm here..."</p><p>"Work and Play" Agatha smiled faintly, then glanced at Rio and stood up from the fire "I know what you want," she slowly stepped closer. The green witch just stood there, concentrating on Agatha's movements "But you won't get my soul" her eyes turned purple.</p><p>"What makes you think that's why I'm here?" Rio raised her eyebrows mischievously and she took a step towards the witch.</p><p>"Why would you come for anything else?" asked Agatha with a smirk "You bitch" the word came out of her mouth without thinking, but she didn't mind.</p><p>"What, you can't even call me by my name now?" asked Rio as she stroked the dagger in her belt holster "But if you prefer, you can call me Lady Death" a wicked grin spread across her face and she drew her dagger, but Agatha was already well prepared for the attack. She grabbed Rio's arm.</p><p>"Don't you ever dream of me calling you that!" she twisted her wrist as she dropped the dagger.</p><p>Agatha kicked her away and sent a purple beam of light into Rio's chest, nearly knocking her into the burning flames of the fireplace. The fight continued and grew more intense. They had been fighting for minutes, each side trying to overpower the other. Magical blows zigzagged through the air, but neither refused to back down. Agatha tried a more powerful spell, but Rio quickly dodged it and returned the attack. Every corner of the room was ablaze with spells, and the energy burst forth with such force that the entire room glowed.</p><p>"You're a little out of your depth" Agatha said as she dodged Rio's next spell with a light movement. Her tone was mocking and challenging.</p><p>"You'll never win, but believe me, I'm enjoying it" Rio replied, her eyes as sharp as daggers. You could almost hear the stinging tension in the air as the spells fluttered around them.</p><p>But with a small spell, Rio faltered, and Agatha quickly moved closer to her. The energy almost exploded and for a moment they both stopped casting spells and faced each other. The air was suddenly still, as if the fight had stopped and now something else had begun.</p><p>"Aren't we fighting anymore?" Rio asked, flashing a half smile and stepping a little closer.</p><p>"Looks like it" Agatha replied, a spark of excitement flashing in her eyes as she stepped closer. The whole situation suddenly felt like the start of a dance, but both parties wanted to control the steps in the same way.</p><p>"Really?" Rio's voice was challenging as their eyes locked. Fighting seemed to have ceased to matter now, the tension in the air had turned hot and both women were aware of the dangerous allure of the situation.</p><p>"We could fight, but there was no useless point. Now, tell me exactly why you're here" Agatha's reply was cool but clearly insinuating.</p><p>"I can see you're not afraid of me" Rio smiled mockingly as she stepped closer, almost breathing her words into Agatha's ear "And you might even enjoy the next game."</p><p>The situation was getting more and more exciting, not with magic, but with the energy building up close to them, which was turning into a hot, scintillating moment for both of them. Both knew that they were on the borderline, and though the magical battle was over, the tension between them still hung in the air, in a secret dance that neither could really explain. Gradually Death drew her lips lower and lower from Agatha's ear, which was only a few millimetres from her neck. Agatha froze completely, only small sighs escaping her lips as she breathed heavily from time to time.</p><p>"Rio..." she said in a muffled but warning tone, as if she was doing something she shouldn't.</p><p>"Well, you know my name then" Rio gasped, but Agatha pulled away.</p><p>"You still haven't answered my question" her voice was commanding and uncontradictory.</p><p>"Come on Agatha...You don't have to hide your desperate need for my touch" Rio looked at her slowly.</p><p>"Shut up!" Agatha raised her voice, even though it was damn true. Suddenly, she felt like she wanted nothing more than Rio's touch like she used to. Her thoughts were racing. Was that really the only reason Rio had come here? Did she know this would be the outcome? No, Agatha couldn't give her what she wanted, even if that was what she wanted too. She can't let Rio in again because then she'll be disappointed again and regret it later. Death noticed Agatha's hesitation. But she had almost succeeded in seducing her. An uncomfortable silence fell over the house. Rio didn't know when she'd see Agatha again, but she had to go. She'd give her a break, otherwise the game wouldn't be exciting.</p>

<p>1912 Titanic</p><p>On board, the wind blew frosty, but Agatha Harkness walked with effortless elegance along the long corridor, her snow-white gloved fingers just touching the mahogany railing. Her deep blue dress fitted her figure perfectly. Reaching the door of her room, she opened it with a soft sigh. The next moment a strong arm pressed her against the wall. Suddenly even her breath caught, partly from the corset and partly from surprise. For she was confronted by a charismatic woman she had not seen for a long time.</p><p>"It's been a long time" Agatha finally spoke, trying to keep her voice calm as she tried to break free from Rio's grip.</p><p>"Just give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you right here!" Rio growled, her eyes aflame, but there was a dangerous playful vibrancy to her voice.</p><p>"For one thing, not a very creative death. On the other thing, your precious rules forbid you to kill me" Agatha replied with a half-smile.</p><p>Rio scanned her. That dress. That hair. That expression.</p><p>"Good, then give me one reason why I shouldn't rip that dress off you!"</p><p>Agatha laughed, her was voice soft and seductive.</p><p>"Well, I think it would be a shame. I look pretty hot in it."</p><p>Rio snorted.</p><p>"I can still hurt you. Then the dress stays on."</p><p>The blade of the dagger glistened in the bright chandelier above them as it touched Agatha's throat and just barely pressed into the soft skin.</p><p>"Wait!" she cried.</p><p>Rio paused, her eyes intent.</p><p>"Why are you here? I have a feeling it's not just because of me."</p><p>After a few seconds of tense silence, Rio released Agatha and stepped back.</p><p>"I didn't actually know I'd find you here. This boat is not going to land anywhere. More than a thousand souls...will drown. That's why I'm here."</p><p>"Oh, how dramatic" Agatha remarked mockingly, but her voice was softer now.</p><p>"And you? As a noble lady on the Titanic?" Rio raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"More like a runaway witch" Agatha shrugged "I was being chased and it seemed like a very good solution. I could get used to this pleasant sailing."</p><p>Rio's expression changed. Something else shone behind the murderous intent. A soft, weightless sigh escaped Agatha's lips as she stood still, facing the witch who still held her at gunpoint. The sound of the sea then rumbled muffled through the body of the ship. The storm was coming.</p><p>"This is not the best place to kill each other" Agatha observed quietly.</p><p>Rio did not reply immediately. Slowly, she lowered the dagger even lower.</p><p>"How much time do they have?" asked Agatha.</p><p>"Maybe a day" said Rio, watching the witch's movements "Face it Agatha, we're both stuck here. What if we... make a ceasefire."</p><p>"No way! You'd cut my throat the first chance you got!" snapped Agatha.</p><p>Rio's voice became serious.</p><p>"Tell me,...unlike you, have I ever broken a single promise?"</p><p>Agatha did not answer immediately. She looked at the floor for a long moment. She knew it was a bad idea, but the situation left her no choice.</p><p>"Just you and me? No tricks?" she asked with raised eyebrows.</p><p>Rio nodded, a subtle smile appearing on her lips.</p><p>"Just imagine: a luxury dinner, champagne, music and a witch you've known for a long time."</p><p>Agatha laughed softly. It sounded too good.</p><p>"Fine. A ceasefire... just until this ship sinks" she stepped closer, continuing almost in a whisper "We are the only ones who know what is coming. While the others are just getting ready for dinner. And we...we buy time."</p><p>"And what will you do with your time if you can't fight me?" Rio asked with a glint in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha's smile widened.</p><p>"I'll make you dinner."</p><p>"Is this flirting or manipulation?"</p><p>"Neither" Agatha said as she headed for the door "Just... necessity. It would be nice to see you stick a knife in your steak instead of me."</p><p>Rio laughed and shook her head, but finally started after her. Across the hall, piano music could be heard from the restaurant as if nothing was happening. Not yet. They found a table in a more secluded spot by the window, but the music was still quite audible. They sat down opposite each other and Rio kept staring at Agatha, who was looking out of the window at the roaring sea.</p><p>"It's been a long time since we've been like this together" Rio said quietly.</p><p>Agatha then turned to her, and shrugged.</p><p>"I still hate you. It's only temporary, don't get your hopes up!"</p><p>Rio bit her lip in disappointment. Soon after, they brought out their dinner, which they ate in quiet. The air grew tense throughout the dinner and they could feel their attraction for each other. Rio couldn't help but let out a smile as Agatha blushed.</p><p>"Oh, after all this time?" asked Rio mockingly.</p><p>"Shut up!" said Agatha tensely, but she was really annoyed that her body was betraying her like that. At the same time, she thought Rio was so damn sexy and for some reason her wild, passionate side came out.</p><p>"I can see you're sweating Agatha" Rio leaned closer, her eyes flashing darkly "Your body betrays you, especially...down there" her gaze drifted to Agatha's thighs.</p><p>"That's enough!" Agatha growled at her, shifting nervously in her chair as her eyes darted around, afraid someone might hear them.</p><p>"And I know how badly you want my touch..."</p><p>"If you say one more word, I swear..." Agatha hissed through clenched teeth, but she couldn't hide the stirring inside her.</p><p>Rio didn't wait for her to finish the sentence, she just smiled faintly, enjoying Agatha's angry and heated gaze. They sat in awkward silence for the next few minutes, and after finishing dinner, they finally headed back to their room. They walked through the door and Agatha slammed it shut behind them.</p><p>"What were you thinking?" she snapped at Rio.</p><p>The green witch just stood stiffly in the middle of the room, a cheeky smile spreading across her face.</p><p>"Anyone could have heard that!" added Agatha, as she turned her back irritably and reached behind her to begin unfastening her corset.</p><p>"Let me help you" Rio said, moving closer.</p><p>"No!" shouted Agatha, "You sit down there!" she pointed imperiously to the chair next to the bed.</p><p>Rio froze for a moment. She sensed her lover was taking control and decided it would be foolish not to play the game. So she slowly took a seat in the chair.</p><p>"Good" Agatha had half the clothes off her back.</p><p>Rio was so keen to go over and help untie Agatha's corset, sliding it off her shoulders, exposing the smooth skin. She knew she was torturing her on purpose. This was punishment for what had happened at dinner, but Rio could see that some of the area Agatha could no longer reach on her back alone. An expectant smile spread across her face as she heard Agatha's low curses.</p><p>"Let me help you"</p><p>Agatha sighed and, realising she couldn't do it alone, nodded. Rio happily stepped closer and slowly began to loosen the string from the fabric of the dress. It fell from Agatha's shoulders and left only an undressed one. Rio's dress had no corset, so she just slipped out of it.</p><p>"Good, now turn away" Agatha's voice was unsteady.</p><p>"Not that I haven't seen you before, but okay" Rio replied, rolling her eyes and turning her back to the witch.</p><p>Finally, as they both pulled on nightgowns, the attraction didn't fade, but intensified. Agatha, however, could not stand it any longer. She grabbed the pillow and blanket next to her and threw it on the couch across the room.</p><p>"What are you doing now?" asked Rio, laughing.</p><p>"You're going to sleep here" Agatha said and walked back to the bed.</p><p>"Come on Agatha! You're only fooling yourself. Besides...it's not my fault that your body decided before you did" she smiled slyly and extinguished the candles burning on the large chandelier. Only one remained lit on the desk beside the bed. Rio crawled under the covers on the sofa.</p><p>Agatha watched her for a while, leaning on her elbows in surprise. She thought Rio would beg to stay in bed. She made herself comfortable and pulled the blanket over herself, but no sleep came to her eyes and she felt more and more the heat consuming her when Rio wasn't near. Probably exactly what the little bitch was trying to do. Agatha hated her and tried hard, but she couldn't take it anymore. She couldn't handle the feelings Rio was making her feel.</p><p>"I hope you're still hungry" Agatha said suddenly, her voice hoarse with desire.</p><p>Rio smiled under the blanket. She got up from the sofa and slowly approached.</p><p>"I can still eat a dessert" a temptingly wide smile spread across her mouth, but when she reached it she stopped at the edge of the bed.</p><p>The air in the cabin was hot and heavy, like the tension that vibrated between them. Rio saw Agatha's chest heave and begin to stir impatiently.</p><p>"If you've come just to stare, then go away!" she hissed, but there was no real hostility in her voice. Only raw desire and impatience.</p><p>"I'm just wondering," Rio said quietly, stepping closer, "Why I always want you so much, when I hate you the most."</p><p>Agatha laughed mockingly.</p><p>"You don't want me" she said slowly, almost savouring the words "You're just weak."</p><p>Rio didn't answer, just stepped over and in one movement pressed Agatha's wrist to the bed, but not violently as before. More like annoyed.</p><p>"Yes? Then why are your hands shaking?" Rio asked hoarsely.</p><p>Agatha's lips quivered.</p><p>"Because you've upset me."</p><p>"You're lying"</p><p>The silence became deeper, more suffocating than the ocean beneath the boat. Finally Rio looked into Agatha's eyes and asked no more questions. Her fingers slid along the other witch's arm, slowly, provocatively, and then she let go. Agatha at this point was desperately pushing her body up off the mattress, but her shoulder was shaking. She looked Rio in the eye and said nothing. The next moment, the two bodies were pressed against each other. There was no tenderness. Only the weight of years unspoken, and of finding themselves in the same place again. When they finally fell on the bed, it wasn't a kiss that bound them together. It was the way they knew each other's skin so perfectly, just as they used to. Clothes fell to the floor, weightless. Only the rustle of the sheets, the deepening of breaths, and the moonlight remained as witness. The air was heavy, and every movement was at once fury and desire. When a shiver ran down Agatha's back, she didn't need to say anything. Rio knew this was what she wanted. What they had both denied until now.</p><p>~</p><p>It was dawn. Inside the cabin, starlight filtered in through the small window, but the stillness was suddenly broken by a rattle and alarmed cries. The ship shook, and Agatha's eyes snapped open. From one corner of the room she could hear water splashing through the cracks.</p><p>"What the...?" she growled, automatically reaching for her shoes on the floor, but the water was almost up to her knees.</p><p>Rio was already dressed and stood silent. Water was pouring in through the doors and windows. Only screams of distress and the splashing of water filled the cabin. Agatha stepped to the mirror and quickly pinned a lock of hair behind her ear, her hand already reaching for her locket. Her dress was still half on the sofa, but there was no time to dress for long.</p><p>"How the hell did all this water get in here?" asked Agatha tensely.</p><p>"Because this boat is slowly sinking to the bottom of the sea" Rio said quietly, "It hit an iceberg in the night."</p><p>Agatha found Rio's calmness increasingly annoying.</p><p>"Is this a joke? Why don't you do something?"</p><p>Rio just looked at her.</p><p>"Because I'm not here to rescue them" she said, adjusting her weapons, "I'm just... escorting them. That's my job."</p><p>Agatha's eyes narrowed and she suddenly forgot all about yesterday. As if it had never happened.</p><p>"Oh, of course, your job. Always the work."</p><p>"Don't start that again" Rio said coolly.</p><p>"Why not?" retorted Agatha, "You always disappear, when someone's need you!"</p><p>Rio's expression was one of anger.</p><p>"You say that? You're going to fly away anyway, just to save your own ass again!"</p><p>"Yes. Because I'm not stupid!" retorted Agatha.</p><p>"I thought..." Rio lowered her volume a little "I thought for a moment that maybe we didn't hate each other that much anymore."</p><p>Agatha laughed mockingly.</p><p>"What made you think that? Because we had dinner? Or because we didn't kill each other for a few hours?"</p><p>Rio stepped closer. Her gaze was angry, but there was also something painful in it.</p><p>"It wasn't about dinner! It was about the fact that, for one night at least, you seemed human... not a traitor."</p><p>Agatha tensed.</p><p>"Don't you dare..."</p><p>"Don't I dare what, Agatha? To remind you that you could have saved your son with a deal, but you were too coward?" Rio's voice trembled, but it didn't falter.</p><p>A painful flash ran through Agatha's eyes and hatred found its way again, between pain and love.</p><p>"This was none of your business! You never had the right..."</p><p>"I was his mother too!" Rio interjected, almost shouting "And you decided so many things without me!"</p><p>The boat jerked beneath them with another crack. Somewhere, a chair overturned, a distant splash of water echoed off the metal walls. Agatha nervously put on her locket.</p><p>"This is over now" she said firmly.</p><p>"Oh, don't think we're done with this!" Rio snarled, her voice threatening, "There will never be a ceasefire between us again. No more dinners, no more deals. The next time we meet...</p><p>... that will be a fight" Agatha finished.</p><p>They looked at each other for a few seconds. Everything was there in the darkness: desire, anger, memories and betrayal. Then they both turned and started in the opposite direction, back into the sinking world. The boat was getting deeper and deeper, perhaps only a small part of it was visible. Rio had been called by the souls, and the time had come. Without a word, she turned her back on Agatha.</p><p>"Te veo" there was hatred in her eyes, which perhaps more than ever before had penetrated Agatha's soul. She stepped out of the door, leaving the other witch alone.</p><p>Suddenly, the wall behind the bed was inexorably flooded. Agatha didn't delay, trailing a streak of purple behind her, she flew out the window. From a distance, she took one last look at the cabin and with it the memories. It was only a one-night adventure, and there was nothing left of it. It was all swamped by the wild waves of the sea.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>1922 Prague</p><p>The twilight turned the sky deep purple, while the earth shook with the vibrations of magic. Agatha Harkness stood among the ruins of an abandoned church, her hands shaking slightly, her face darker than usual. She followed the darkness, feeling something calling to her. And she knew exactly where to find it. She came to a dark corridor with an isolated stone wall and a winding staircase leading up. In his hands, glowing purple orbs of light glowed in the darkness. She heard faint whispers and breathed heavily as she strode up the steps. She found herself in a cold attic-like place, but she saw no one. She could only feel the inviting darkness. She knew it wouldn't be that easy and there was bound to be a trap. Suddenly she felt as if her legs were getting heavier, as if a heavier weight was being hung on them. Then her feet were literally rooted to the ground and she caught sight of a dark figure in the corner. Agatha tried tensely to move her legs, but failed. The shape came a little further out into the light. It was a man, but his face was distorted and his whole forearm was black. Agatha seemed to keep her blood cold and was about to say something, but at that moment she heard a faint voice in her mind speaking to her.</p><p>Agatha Harkness, your power is growing. But there is so much more in you</p><p> </p><p>Agatha then realised that it was not the man talking to her, but a magical book floating next to him. It was not just any book. The Darkhold hovered there before her, above a stone ledge, pulsing with black flames like a living heart pumping out nothing but destruction.</p><p>"I know why you are here" Agatha was disappointed this time by the man's voice. The magician stood on the other side. His name was long lost in the dust of centuries, but his magic was raw, wild and unforgiving.</p><p>"Your time is up. It's time to give me the book" Agatha said firmly.</p><p>"No" the magician's face contorted and he grew a blackened orb of power straight into Agatha's chest, whose legs let go of the ground and she slammed into the wall.</p><p>The air began to vibrate as the first spell unleashed a yellowish bolt of lightning slashed into the ground at Agatha's feet, nearly knocking her off balance. Agatha laughed evilly and struck back. The battle was on, lightning bolts followed and Agatha knew she couldn't leave without what she had come for. However, in time she realized that this opponent was too strong, but then there was nothing she could do. The mage beckoned without a sound and the ground began to crack. Shadows crawled out of it, with claws and dozens of faceless mouths. With desperate speed Agatha drew protection around herself, but her walls could not hold for long and after the first cracks, blood gushed from her nose, her knees shook and she stumbled in her own cloak. The next spell was no longer defensive. She fell to her knees. Her fingers gripped the ground, but she found no grip. With one last, clean movement, the magician raised his hand in the air, and as if the book itself had moved with him, a black light flashed, throwing Agatha's body back like a rag doll. It struck the remains of a pillar, leaving a terrible bruise on her back. She did not cry out. She only gasped silently. The magician stepped up to the Darkhold, and holding his palm over it, the book bowed obediently. Agatha just watched. She couldn't move. She dared not. There was no reason to. The dark flames died away, the ruins of the temple falling silent as the mage was swallowed by the earth. Agatha Harkness lay there, bloodied, humiliated, and for the first time in centuries, a failure. She screamed in rage and pounded her fists on the marble stone. The whole church shook with the purple magic that had escaped from her palm. The thought that she'd failed almost killed her. For a few minutes she lay staring aimlessly at the cracked ceiling. She felt darkness again and heard a low, ominous whisper from behind her. At that moment she picked up her head and turned around. To his utter surprise, the Darkhold hovered in front of her. She went over and picked it up. Then the book began to speak to her again:</p><p>You have a lot of potential...You can achieve what you wish for....You will be the strongest witch...</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and imagined what she could accomplish. It would be her life's purpose. Perhaps the book had left its old owner and she had sensed in it the great darkness that had lurked within her since she was very young. For which she had been condemned and was to be executed. But what if this is the answer to everything? To gain power, to develop knowledge. Her mouth pulled into a wide evil grin and with a devilish laugh she left the temple.</p><p>~</p><p>The Darkhold as a new owner. Rio would never have guessed it was Agatha. When she found out, she immediately went to warn her. She searched for a long time, and the bond between them allowed her to track Agatha down as quickly as possible. She never lost sight of her for long. Rio stopped outside a nightclub and guesthouse, then changed into casual clothes. She stepped through the door and looked around. She caught a glimpse of Agatha at the bar, talking casually to people. Rio watched her get up and make her way up the stairs with suspicious movements. She followed and watched Agatha walk through the door of her room. Before she could close it, Rio leaned against the doorjamb and hurried over and stopped the door from closing with her foot. Agatha hadn't expected to find her here, but before she could think about it, Rio had kicked her in the stomach with her high heel and pushed her across the room.</p><p>Agatha scrambled to her feet. Her eyes glowed with the challenge.</p><p>"Now I know some tricks that will work even against you!" she shouted proudly.</p><p>"I have to disappoint you, because I'm not here to fight" Rio declared.</p><p>"Then what was that before?!" fidgeted Agatha as she adjusted her dress.</p><p>Rio shrugged.</p><p>"It felt good"</p><p>Agatha was about to retaliate when Rio spoke again.</p><p>"I know what you have in your possession."</p><p>"Oh, this?" Agatha produced the book, "It was in the wrong hands, I couldn't leave it there" she added with a sly smile.</p><p>"I warn you, you can do great damage with it. It also contains spells that are forbidden by the laws of nature" Rio's voice was not at all playful.</p><p>"Mmm someone takes their job very seriously"</p><p>"This is not a game Agatha!" Rio raised her voice this time.</p><p>"You used to like my games" Agatha smiled faintly.</p><p>Rio gave her a piercing look.</p><p>"You know what, I'm glad you're here" Agatha paced around the room and smiled at Rio's puzzled expression "I've never tested a spell on anyone before. Come on, darling, I'll show you what I can do!"</p><p>She started to chant a spell, and Rio drew her dagger and leapt towards Agatha, but she couldn't get close to her. It was as if a wall separated her. She glanced at the book floating next to Agatha and threw her dagger at it with a forceful gesture.</p><p>"No!" Agatha shouted angrily, and the bubble disappeared around her.</p><p>Rio immediately jumped at her throat and began to squeeze hard. Agatha kicked her in the ankle, and as Rio was in high heels, she wobbled easily. The witch took the opportunity to wrap purple vines around her. Rio tried to break free and Agatha began to mutter another incantation. Suddenly Rio felt a great heat all over her body and her skin began to burn under the bandages. She screamed in pain and Agatha's evil smile burned into her soul. At that moment Rio felt that this was not the Agatha she knew. She became more cruel, more determined and sadistic. It was mostly that stupid book that had caused it all. Rio could already feel the pain consuming her completely as the burning tendrils, almost to her bones. When the pain became unbearable, she used her green power and aimed it at Agatha, who ducked, but as she was distracted, Rio's body fell to the ground. She gasped heavily and was covered in bloody welts. Agatha's eyes glittered darkly. Rio slowly stood up, her murderous gaze never taking her eyes off Agatha for a moment, and the wounds gradually contracted and then disappeared completely. Agatha stood back for a moment, and Rio took her dagger in her hand again.</p><p>"I can't kill you...but you're going to beg me to" with that, the plants snaking from her hands grabbed Agatha's ankles, and she slammed backwards against the floor with terrible force.</p><p>She cut the rope with her purple and started to run quickly on all fours towards the sofa in the room. Rio threw her dagger after her, but Agatha ducked, causing it to dig into the back of the sofa. The green witch threw herself full force at Agatha. She sat on Agatha's hips, grabbed her long knotted hair and yanked with one powerful motion. Agatha hissed as she raised up from the floor.</p><p>"Get ready for the pain Agatha! Let it wash over you!" shouted Rio mockingly, grabbing Agatha's head and slamming it full force against the floor.</p><p>Agatha cried out in pain and felt blood pouring from her nose. And that was only the beginning.</p><p>"Ahh, I knew you enjoyed it!" Rio laughed crazily.</p><p>Agatha crawled out from under her, and with a purple flash of light, pushed her to the edge of the bed. For a moment they both took deep breaths and stopped. For now.</p><p>"Why are you doing this? Why can't you just leave me alone? Because I broke a fucking deal?" Agatha screamed.</p><p>"It's not just about the deal anymore" Rio was still breathing hard after the fight.</p><p>"Then what is it about?" asked Agatha, arms wide open.</p><p>"You hurt me Agatha! You let me down!" Rio was now shouting.</p><p>"Oh, you say that? You took everything from me! You gave me nothing in return!"</p><p>Rio stepped closer, her eyes softening a little.</p><p>"I miss him every day too. It hurts so much."</p><p>"You should have let him live! But no, your job was more important to you than our family!" the words just poured out of Agatha.</p><p>"That's not true..." Rio's voice shook.</p><p>Agatha wiped her bloody nose and a deep, painful sigh escaped her lips.</p><p>"Even after all this time, I can hardly bear to look at you. You look too much like him."</p><p>Rio swallowed. Agatha's face suddenly changed again. The effect of the Darkhold could be a rapid change of mood. She seemed to have snapped. She pulled Rio's dagger from the couch and started waving it at her.</p><p>"I hate you! That night on the Titanic, the night we met, I regret everything!" Agatha spoke without thinking.</p><p>Rio groaned, so hurt by her ex-lover's words. Then she remembered that she wanted to kill Agatha, and the pain gave her even more strength. The fight continued. Rio twisted the dagger from the other witch's hand and it fell to the floor. Agatha kicked it away in one swift move and then slapped her on the face. Rio was so upset that without thinking, she grabbed the knitting needle lying on the coffee table and reached for the witch. The needle successfully pierced Agatha's elbow, who cried out in pain. Rio grinned wickedly and pulled it through Agatha's entire elbow, then pulled it out. The purple witch wailed and looked down at her elbow. This will definitely need stitches.</p><p>"Stop it!" shouted Agatha.</p><p>"Now, are you ready to surrender?" asked Rio, the fire in her voice not so intense now.</p><p>"Never!" Agatha's voice rang with mockery.</p><p>"Look at yourself! This is not the same Agatha I know!" Rio stepped closer.</p><p>"That woman was weak. The one standing here now is stronger and more powerful" Agatha proudly pulled herself out "I became my life's ambition. But of course you can't understand that."</p><p>Rio bowed her head "Fine, I don't care about you..."</p><p>"If you'll excuse me, I must go" Agatha interrupted "I never want to see you again.</p><p>"We'll see next time" Rio said quietly.</p><p>"No" said Agatha coldly "There won't be a next time. This is the end. It's finished. The little pliers are finished."</p><p>Silence. Agatha turned away and made herself look Rio in the eye one last time. She met an angry glance, but didn't care. With a quick snap, she vanished into thin air, leaving Rio alone in the quiet room. Her hands balled into fists and she walked out the door. The room remained as it was: cold and silent.</p><p> </p><p>1924 Florida</p><p>Agatha had returned to America and in recent years she had become known as the Witch Killer among witches and wizards. The Darkhold showed her what she was capable of. But she didn't use it much, knowing the consequences. Many people approached her to cast spells for them and in return, of course, they gave her something. Agatha scrounged around a crowded place full of witches to get an ingredient to pay them. In the middle was a stage. It must have been some kind of event. As she entered backstage, she came across a room of potions. She looked around, but saw no one.</p><p>"Can I help you with something?" a firm female voice addressed her.</p><p>Agatha suddenly turned and grinned.</p><p>"My name is Agatha Harkness and..."</p><p>"I know who you are" the woman stepped closer.</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows questioningly.</p><p>"The witch killer" the woman's contemptuous tone surprised Agatha "If you want my power, you can't have it!"</p><p>"What, no! Me your power?" laughed Agatha, "I've come for a simple little potion."</p><p>"In that case, perhaps I can help. My name is Jennifer Kale and I'm a Potion Witch" she said proudly.</p><p>Agatha smiled faintly.</p><p>"I need a love potion"</p><p>Jennifer walked over to a shelf and lifted a small pink vial off it, then walked to the cash register.</p><p>"Anything else besides this?" Jen's voice was still mocking.</p><p>"Hmm" Agatha was visibly thoughtful "It's not very crowded in this shop" she noted.</p><p>Jennifer gave her an annoyed look.</p><p>"Does this potion even work?" continued Agatha "You don't seem to be very good at your job."</p><p>"At least I have a proper job" Jen retorted.</p><p>"What makes you think I don't?" asked Agatha indignantly.</p><p>"I know what they say about you" Jen started pacing around the shop.</p><p>Agatha raised an amused eyebrow.</p><p>"And about your son..." Jen continued.</p><p>The smile melted off Agatha's face. How would she know that?</p><p>"What did you say?" she asked, her voice threatening.</p><p>"You traded your child for the Book of the Damned. Are the rumours true?" asked Jen.</p><p>Agatha had no idea what she was talking about. Where did this rumour even come from? She would never know.</p><p>"Well it is true that you are a cruel person" continued Jen.</p><p>Agatha didn't answer, but left the shop without paying.</p><p>"Hey!" Jennifer called after her, but by the time she got out of the door Agatha was gone.</p><p>She was already out of the venue. Anger, incomprehension and pain all swirled inside her at once. The streets were dark and Agatha just walked with a hood over her head.</p><p> </p><p>1926 Boston</p><p>Agatha walked the streets of Boston and thought deeply. There were countless witch trails popping up here lately, but the rumors still bothered her and more and more people were hearing them. Suddenly, however, she threw her head back when a man spoke to her.</p><p>"Are you Agatha Harkness? The witch?" he asked coldly. Agatha assumed he was a doctor from the way he was dressed.</p><p>"You want to charm your lover, or perhaps silence your wife? What do you want?" asked Agatha routinely. 'A lot of people have been approaching her with problems like this lately.</p><p>"No, I want you to block the power of a witch" the man's voice was demanding.</p><p>Agatha approached, interested. It had been a long time since she had been asked to do that.</p><p>"Hmm this is a very complicated spell. It could take hours, but I can do it" she said, "But a spell like this comes at a price" a sly smile came over her face.</p><p>"Of course I will pay you well. Will 80 dollars be enough?" he asked.</p><p>Agatha smiled and nodded.</p><p>"It will be ready by tonight."</p><p>The man nodded, but like everyone else he hadn't given her the money yet. Only after Agatha had done the work. They parted and Agatha immediately headed for her small apartment in Boston. The room was enchanted and the walls were dark. When she entered, the Darkhold was already hovering over the bed. Agatha flipped through it and found it, the page where the binding spells and charms could be cast. To do this, she had to make runes in such a way that they were very durable. It was indeed a complicated spell and the hardest part of it all was that you had to cast it on a specific area so that the witch who entered it would be bound. Agatha had to be ready for the evening and placed in the venue for the Boston Society of Gynecology opening ceremonies. She had her eyes on it, but the Book of Sethe kept distracting her, whispering in her ear. But she resisted them. A few hours later she was done with it, and met the doctor again in an alley.</p><p>"I put the bound charm on her, whoever she is. Now I want my reward" said Agatha.</p><p>The man thanked her, took the money from his pocket and handed it to Agatha. Then they parted ways. Agatha thought with a sly smile. 80 dollars is a lot of money. It occurred to her that she could buy you a drink for Valentine's Day. Though she wasn't in the mood to enjoy a lovers' holiday. Instead, she wondered how to hide her feelings, as she always did. As she walked, a man her age took one look at her and she smiled seductively at him. She entered the bar, the soft sounds of jazz mingling with the thick tobacco smoke, and the whole thing must have felt like time stood still. Just what she needed. She asked for a drink and couldn't ignore the eyes on her. She enjoyed it so much and deep down she felt she wanted more. It had been a long time since he'd had sex and, frankly, she missed it. She missed the domination. Valentine's Day is not a good day to spend alone, but she decided to go home instead. She quickly downed her drink and left the bar. When she opened the door to her apartment, she saw a postcard and a bunch of flowers on the table. Surprised, she picked up the postcard with this inscription:</p><p>Happy Valentine's Day, my love! 🖤</p><p>There was no signature, but the black heart at the end said it all. Agatha rolled her eyes. Looks like she really wasn't going to get rid of Rio easily. She also hated being called that. She doesn't even celebrate Valentine's Day, as Rio hasn't been her lover for a very long time, but unfortunately she can't escape the fact that she will be forever tied to her.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>1944 Normanda, France</p><p>The fog sat like a heavy veil over the bloody sand. The waves washed the shore at a dull pace, but there was no one to listen. Only Death hovered in the air, herself. Rio Vidal's black cloak fluttered gently in the soft breeze, her footsteps leaving no trace, as if she did not belong to this world. Her face was impassive, but in her eyes there was a deep sadness, not of compassion, but of the fatigue of duty. The soul of one of the soldiers still sat beside his body, his hand on his stomach where the bullet had hit him. The young French soldier, barely twenty years old, looked up with a trembling look as he saw the woman approaching.</p><p>"You're not a nurse, are you?"</p><p>"No" said Rio in French, quietly but clearly "I'll come when you have nothing more to do on this earth."</p><p>The boy did not retreat. He just nodded slowly.</p><p>"Too many have died..." he said, barely audible "My brothers... friends... all in the land... but we fought for our country."</p><p>Rio crouched down beside him. Her gaze wasn't cold, just tired, carrying the weight of centuries. All that explaining, haunting countless souls who had died in war. She got tired of it after a while, but she had to stay true to her job and do her duty.</p><p>"Their souls do not belong to the earth. Today they all return home" she said firmly.</p><p>The boy's eyes filled with tears, but not of fear.</p><p>"It is an honour... to die for France."</p><p>Rio held out her hand. As soon as her cold fingers touched the boy's shoulder, his body slowly turned to light. There was a sigh, nothing more. The air fell silent. A soul was on his way again. Rio stood up. Through the trees, more lights flickered. She sensed hundreds more waiting for her, even millions, just at this moment. The work was not finished.</p><p> </p><p>2003</p><p>The room was dimly lit, the only light in the room illuminating the grey, antiquated furniture from the gaps between the bookshelves. The windows were saturated with the last, fading rays of sunlight, but Agatha paid no attention to the outside world. The Darkhold was all she had. She'd used it on and off for decades, and though she knew everything it had to offer, somehow she always wanted more. She sat in front of a huge table, the book lying open in front of her. The pages were dusty, almost cleaned as her black fingertips cut through them. Each word of the ancient spells, the dark rituals, soaked deeper into her skin. The effects of the spells, which she might have been able to reject before, now took over her every thought as a matter of course.</p><p>"Power is sweeter than anything else. And the Darkhold gives me everything I want" she whispered to herself, not that anyone could hear her. Only her and the book existed in the room.</p><p>As she leaned forward, the words on the pages of the book almost called to her. The lights of the ancient runes glowed faintly, and Agatha's lips began to whisper the words almost automatically as her eyes grew darker. Magical energy leaked from the book, the air around her vibrated with tension. She knew she was no longer the woman she had once been. The Agatha she once was, who might have still held love and loyalty as important on some level, had now forgotten all that. The book had absorbed everything. The only thing she loved now was the knowledge and power the book gave her. Magical energy filled the room and Agatha finally had what she had always wanted: control over everything. Her voice was soft but powerful.</p><p>"Why should I look for anything else when the Darkhold gives me everything? I don't need anyone else to get what I want."</p><p>Then the room shuddered for a moment. The spell she had just performed had achieved its desired effect: the walls of the room, as if sensing the flow of magic, began to change. A dark, troubled light flickered in Agatha's eyes, and her every movement grew darker and darker. But the Darkhold was far from taking full control of her. Agatha had also read a lot about how anyone who becomes too engrossed in the book becomes completely distorted and transformed over time. She didn't use it as often and only performed minor spells to make this process happen as slowly as possible. But it has most certainly already begun. Agatha saw that the tips of her fingertips were black all the way to the top. However much sanity she still had, there was no turning back. Slowly, the Darkhold began to consume her.</p><p> </p><p>2018 The snap</p><p>Lady Death sat on the throne of the afterlife and watched the rippling lights appear before the gate. The door that had been the boundary between life and death now moved strangely. The air began to vibrate, as if some unknown force were trying to shift the balance. Suddenly a crowd of souls came to the door. There were more of them than Rio had ever seen at once. More and more gathered around the border, but each one tried in vain. The door that would have led to the other world remained stiffly closed and would not let them through. The souls of people who had once belonged to the living were now trapped between the gates of death and the world of life. Rio felt something was wrong, but she couldn't put her finger on it. The order of nature she had always known seemed to be suddenly disrupted. But what had happened? The souls that had been unable to move on were now floating here, as if stuck between two planes of the world, in a theoretical space that belonged neither to life nor to death. The souls lined up outside the gate tried desperately to cross the boundary, but all their efforts were in vain. The gate to the afterlife would not open, and Rio could not understand why. There was a new force at work that she didn't know, something that wasn't natural. But still, something deep inside her was stirring. A feeling that a new law was now in force. Something that might set things right. Or maybe it was overthrowing everything she'd ever known. Was half of humanity going to die overnight? How is that possible? It was a strange feeling. The balance she'd always felt so sure of now seemed to be blurred. Maybe it was a new order, maybe it was a new chaos. The world she'd been controlling now made her feel as if she had to reassess everything. Souls still stood at the gate, but they could not enter. The boundary between the living and the dead was now closed tightly in a way never seen before, as if the order of nature that Rio had ruled until then was suddenly upended. But what had really happened? She didn't know. She sensed that something had changed, but whether it was the restoration or the upheaval, she could not say. The balance seemed to be lost, but there was another feeling lurking there: maybe something new had to start. The souls kept trying, but they could no longer get through. They stood helplessly outside the gate, and Rio felt that this could be the beginning of a new cycle. The familiar world was different now, and she did not know why in this new order the border had closed and whether the natural order had indeed been restored, or something much darker had begun.</p><p> </p><p>2023</p><p>Agatha Harkness stepped soundlessly out of the mist. She had already killed the witch-circle around her and taken the power of each of them one by one. The air shuddered as she began to drain the power from one last young witch, who fell to her knees and asked in a whisper:</p><p>"Why are you doing this?"</p><p>Agatha's eyes glittered darkly.</p><p>"Because I am the only one who can handle these powers" she said without flinching, and with a single movement she cut the power cord, the young girl falling dead at her feet.</p><p>Suddenly she felt the presence of a powerful force, but one she had never felt before. A pulsing, raw, pure energy was calling to her. Agatha summoned the Darkhold and hurriedly reached out with her long black fingers to the page she was looking for. To the chapter on the Scarlet Witch. The most powerful witch, able to cast spells without incantations, create illusions and of course, wield great power. Agatha was compelled to investigate. She needed to decipher the source of such power, to make sure her claim was true. She raised her hands in the air and purple energy crept out of the book and went skywards. Agatha followed it and the light turned in one direction and one direction only: Westview. She didn't know what was in that town, but she sensed the source there belonged to someone. Someone with more power than Agatha could ever imagine. She glanced to the side, where a bunny was hopping among the bodies. Agatha had bought it for her experiments a few years ago, but in truth she had grown very attached to him. That's why she named him Senior Scratchy. She took the bunny in her hand and stroked his back.</p><p>"Well, then... time to visit the neighbourhood" she said with a faint sly smile, as if talking to the rabbit, and disappeared into the sky, leaving a trail of purple smoke in her wake.</p><p> </p><p>2026 Westview</p><p>Rio couldn't believe that after all these years she'd finally found Agatha. Three years ago, when the Scarlet Witch came to power, she caught Rio's attention and in time she realised that Agatha had been in Westview all along. However, she was not conscious, but under a spell. Rio appeared at the police station in the guise of an FBI agent on a murder case. She was determined to free Agatha from the spell, as it would be unfair to kill her without her being conscious. Where's the fun in that? A police chief led her to the office of Agatha, or more specifically Agnes. When she entered and saw her after all these years, it wasn't hate that came over her. She enjoyed the fact that Agatha was out of her mind, so she could do whatever she wanted, because she wouldn't remember her anyway. Meanwhile, the Chief of Police had a word with Agatha and left the office. Only then did Rio speak, with a sly smile.</p><p>"It's been a long time" she said, taking a seat on the sofa in the detective's office.</p><p>"What are you doing here?" Agnes cut in as quickly as if she knew who she was talking to.</p><p>"My job" Rio replied with a dark smile.</p><p>"You wanna take control of my investigation?" Agnes asked nervously, her hands folded.</p><p>"No" Rio began with a seductive smile, "If you wanna be in control...you can be"</p><p>Agnes bit her lip tensely. Then she brought the subject back to the case. Rio could see she was embarrassed, she was so cute. Agatha is still attracted to her, not being conscious. However, she had to restrain herself. For now. So, they started talking about the case. Rio tried to hint gently, in case Agnes would remember, but she didn't.</p><p>"Well, who better to solve the mystery than one of Westview's very own?" Rio kept trying and looked Agnes in the eye "You've lived here your whole life"</p><p>The detective eyed her suspiciously.</p><p>"Isn't that true...Agnes?" Rio put the emphasis firmly on the word Agnes.</p><p>Agnes snorted. They stared at each other for a moment, then the detective jumped up from her chair and walked to the door.</p><p>"I don't want you here" she said, poking her head out of the door.</p><p>Rio adjusted her blazer resignedly and paused in the doorway for a moment. She could feel the warmth between their bodies and knew full well that Agnes could feel it too, biting her lip and staring at the floor.</p><p>"Te veo" Rio said at last, and with determined steps, she left the detective's office.</p>

<p>Present</p><p>The sun was barely visible, but its soft rays still lit the courtyard of Agatha's garden. Rio and Billy sat side by side in silence while the boy processed what he had heard.</p><p>"I'm sorry" Billy finally said, turning to Rio.</p><p>The green witch didn't reply, just stared at the flower-filled grave.</p><p>"Don't you have to go and collect her soul to hell or something?" asked Billy again.</p><p>"I don't know" said Rio, "Agatha's soul is half alive."</p><p>"Why?" the boy couldn't stop asking questions.</p><p>"It's complicated, I've already said too much" Rio got up from the grass "Now go about your business!"</p><p>"Wait!" said Billy and looked at Rio with a smile "Thank you!"</p><p>Rio didn't answer at first, just smiled faintly.</p><p>"If you don't keep this a secret, I'll come and get you" her voice was threatening this time.</p><p>Billy swallowed.</p><p>"I won't tell anyone. I promise," he said hurriedly.</p><p>Rio nodded and walked past the pile of flowers. She felt a weight lifted from her shoulders. She had finally accomplished a task she hadn't done in centuries. She knew very well that Agatha needed time to be ready and if she had been patient for centuries, she could wait a little longer.</p><p>~</p><p>This was not how Agatha imagined death. She herself couldn't believe she'd actually done it. The human feelings and experiences were still present, but her body was no longer hers. She could almost taste Rio's kiss in her mouth and was unable to face her again. She also remembered Nicholas. She'd ruined so many things in her life and they seemed to tear her apart inside. Yet she could still suppress it somewhat. She couldn't yet take her place in the world of the dead. She was too attached to life. She knew she should face her faults, but there were so many of them that even as a ghost she feared them. Even after her death, she ran away from her past and the consequences of her bad deeds. She was just a ghost floating between the world of the living and the dead. The events in her courtyard kept replaying in her mind. Perhaps her son's death was no accident. She regretted so much that when she had the Darkhold, she had been so blinded by a lust for power that it had never occurred to her that there might have been a way to bring Nicky back. Or at least she could have eased her conscience, but selfishly she thought only of herself. She let her own child die. These thoughts had plagued her ever since she had that vision at the first trial of the Witch's Road and she didn't want to think about them. Now she was in her basement with Billy, where this whole Witch's Road craze had started. Of course, as it turned out, it wasn't real, but Agatha had suspected that from the very first moment. Billy stood there staring at her with his cute face and Agatha saved him. Saved him to finally do something good in the last moments of her life. She had undeniably grown fond of this kid, and she couldn't make that mistake again. And with that kiss, the bond between her and Rio was finally broken. She finally put her past behind her, free of guilt and escape. So she could give Billy a chance at life. Of course, she'd never admit these things to him, but at least she'd already done it for herself. Meanwhile, the kid had prepared a grave plot for Alice, Lilia and Mrs. Hart, aka Sharon Davis. His good heart had warmed Agatha's heart. She smiled softly, thinking that she was still needed on the front page. She hovered next to the kid.</p><p>"One door closes...</p><p>...and another opens" Billy finished.</p><p>The basement door opened and they looked at each other.</p><p>"Let's go find Tommy" Agatha said at last, determined to help and guide the kid.</p><p>They both walked out into the bright courtyard.</p><p>~</p><p>No telling how much time had passed. Agatha hovered alone in her room, staring into the endless void. After they found Tommy, she began to feel more and more that she didn't feel at home in this house anymore. More and more, she was weighed down by her past actions and felt that her soul could no longer carry the burden of her grievances. She felt tired, aimless and increasingly restless. She realized that perhaps the day had come when she was ready to accept her death and her fate. Maybe that was why Nicky had to die, because fate had punished her for her bad actions. It was all her fault and she blamed Rio for everything all her life. The realizations kept coming, and as she thought of Rio, for the first time she felt ready to meet her. Ready for her new path, even if it led to hell. She closed her eyes and simply let herself go. She had lived without a body before, but now she was gradually moving away from all things earthly. Only feelings remained, as if she were just being in space. She also lost all sense of time, perhaps a few seconds passed before she opened her eyes again. She looked around and she still had grey hair and wore the same clothes, but she knew she was only here in spirit now. The room had changed too. It was all darker and colder. It radiated from one corner where a dark but beautiful figure stood, her dark hair tucked under her hood and trailing black smoke as she stepped closer.</p><p>"Hello, Agatha" Rio's voice was low and cold.</p><p>Agatha had never seen her like this before. It was dark, strong, but not cruel. Her crown was on her head.</p><p>"Is this the afterlife?" asked Agatha quietly.</p><p>Rio smiled softly and stepped closer.</p><p>"No, this is just the beginning of the journey."</p><p>"I am ready. I am ready to die" Agatha spoke firmly and this time there was no resistance in her voice.</p><p>"You said you didn't want me here when it happened" Rio said and Agatha could hear the sadness in her voice. She felt terrible even about it.</p><p>"I know I said that but...you know I didn't mean it" Agatha's spirit was even more intense. And she could finally say it. There was no point in hiding it any longer.</p><p>"Please help me. I want to go. I can't do this anymore."</p><p>"Then I'll show you the way" Rio turned around and a green billowing smoke gate appeared right in front of them "Follow me!"</p><p>Agatha followed and together they stepped through the gate. It was all a complete blur and in Agatha's mind, strangers were talking to her, not very intensely. She was becoming increasingly afraid and knew that heaven was not going to be her home. Rio stopped in front of a black gate. Its columns stretched out into infinity.</p><p>"You have to face them" Rio said, as if she knew exactly what was going on inside Agatha's head.</p><p>Agatha was terrified, but standing here at the gates of hell, there was nowhere to run. This is the end. She glanced at Rio, who nodded, but her eyes showed signs of pain. It was as if she was trying to tell her something, but in the end she didn't speak. They looked at each other for a long time before Agatha pulled herself together and crossed the threshold of the gates of hell. For a moment she saw only darkness. Endless darkness that turned to grey. Beneath her feet, the path was not stone, but ash, the ashes of others. The heat was unbearable, but it burned not her skin, but the very depths of her soul. Then suddenly it became cold.</p><p>Screams, accusations, names, curses.</p><p>Hundreds of souls rushed in. Most of them innocent, killed by her, or left to perish. They were a faceless crowd, yet she knew every face: children, mothers, lovers, witches. Their rage flared up around her.</p><p>"Murderer!" a voice boomed.</p><p>"You betrayed us!" another screamed.</p><p>"You didn't even know my name... you just killed me mercilessly!"</p><p>Agatha backed away at first, trying to defend herself, but the magic refused to obey. Not here. Not in this place. She knelt and buried her face in her palms. Then the spirits parted. They made room for someone. Alice stepped forward. Her dress was burnt, her eyes were dull, but her bearing was dignified.</p><p>"I wanted to save you! But you killed me! You took away the power I'd only just got back! I was barely free of the curse! My life would have begun!" she cried angrily.</p><p>Agatha whispered:</p><p>"I'm sorry! I really didn't mean to, I swear! I couldn't control myself!"</p><p>Alice didn't answer, she just stepped back and another figure took her place. For a moment, Agatha felt as if the immense pain that had been tormenting her soul would be a little less. But the excruciating pain intensified as Evanora Harkness, her mother, approached, almost floating. Her face was expressionless.</p><p>"You have grown stronger than I ever hoped. But you never learned humility. That's what you've become."</p><p>"Was it my fault?" Agatha asked, trembling "Or was it yours?"</p><p>Her mother did not answer immediately. Finally she said:</p><p>"The sin is always in the decision. Not in what you have learned, but in what you have chosen. And you have always chosen yourself over others."</p><p>Agatha fell to her knees. At last she was not defensive. She wasn't begging. She just let her heart open.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Mother" she whispered, "It's not enough, I know. But for the first time... I'm really sorry" as she said the words, the pain lessened and this time she didn't hold back. It no longer mattered how they would look at her. All the pain she'd been carrying from the ground was released and the guilt was greatly reduced in the depths of her soul. The confession poured out of her as she sat on the ground with her eyes closed, facing them. She turned to the hundreds of souls</p><p>"I'm sorry for everything...I made a mistake...I was evil and now I failed - her words were honest for the first time."</p><p>At that moment the souls began to quiet down. They did not disappear, but they did not attack. As if they had been forgiven. The ground shook. The darkness slowly dissolved into light, and Agatha suddenly found herself in a slightly more welcoming room covered in emerald marble. She felt indescribably liberated. Neither happiness or sadness. Only peace and harmony. At last her soul felt lighter. Now she felt not just a soul, but quite human as she looked at herself and noticed that her appearance had changed. Her hair was brown again and she wore a dark purple dress that reached to the ground. The echoes of her footsteps reverberated dully off the walls. She looked around and the large lobby was full of bright doors opening in all directions. Only now did she notice that in the centre of the hall, there sat Lady Death, motionless on her throne, her arms loosely folded. Her gaze was fierce and sharp, but there was a familiar tenderness in the corner of her eye. Agatha's heart sank. Not just because she saw her like this, but because she saw her again. Rio looked much friendlier this time, but there was still something creepy about the way she looked.</p><p>Agatha could hardly speak and when she did, her voice trembled.</p><p>"You... Are you really here? Not just another attempt to break me?"</p><p>Rio's voice was firm but low.</p><p>"I'm not an illusion. I never was. This is my world, I will always be real here."</p><p>Rio stood up from her throne and they stepped closer together. Agatha looked at her.</p><p>"I've imagined this moment so many times. What I would say. What I would do if I saw you again..."</p><p>"And now it had come. You can say it now."</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes for a moment. The pain, the guilt, the desire, all swirled inside her.</p><p>"I've been going crazy without you, Rio. It wasn't the power I missed. Not victory. It was you. Only you" for the first time in centuries, she said her lover's name, and her words were sincere.</p><p>Rio's eyes flashed, and in them were long unspoken grievances.</p><p>"And yet it was you who let me go. Who looked at me as a threat, not as someone to... love."</p><p>Agatha stepped closer in a whisper.</p><p>"Because I was afraid. Of what you could make me feel. That I would be weak. That... you would be important."</p><p>"And now?" asked Rio quietly.</p><p>"Now I know that there is nothing in me stronger than what I feel for you" Agatha said, looking Rio straight in the eye, and another wave of relief swept through her body. But something was still incomplete.</p><p>Rio was very relieved by Agatha's words. For so long she had been waiting for just that one sentence. After a few seconds of silence, she walked towards a door.</p><p>"Come on, it's time for you to go home."</p><p>For a moment, Agatha was overcome with worry. She didn't know what her new home would be, but she secretly hoped it would be somewhere peaceful. She followed her, and together they entered a bright doorway. This time Rio went with her.</p>

<p>The blinding light slowly faded, and Agatha found herself in a beautiful place. She looked around, but Rio was no longer there. Soft grass tickled her bare feet. The air was clean, sweet, and calm. A dense forest rustled around her. Not frightening, but with an infinitely familiar sound. She was wearing looser clothes, something casual and comfortable. Not far away, she spotted a cozy little cottage. Warm light glowed from its windows, and smoke curled from the chimney. It was as if someone was waiting for her. Agatha stepped closer, her bare feet gently tickled by the soft blades of grass, and with every step she felt as if she were leaving behind something huge and heavy. She was very close when suddenly the door opened. And to her great surprise, Nicholas stood before her. Her son, whom she had not seen for centuries. She had almost forgotten his face, what he looked like. The memory was so faint, yet now he stood before her crystal clear. He looked exactly as he did when she last saw him.</p><p> </p><p>"Mama? Is it really you?" the boy asked cautiously.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's eyes filled with tears. She didn't dare move. Her hands trembled and her heart tightened, then a warm glow washed over her.</p><p> </p><p>"Nicky... My God... I... I can't believe it..." She couldn't form coherent words.</p><p> </p><p>Nicolas ran to her and hugged her. Tightly, strongly, as if he wanted to make up for the years. Agatha snuggled up to him, buried her fingers in her son's hair, and just cried.</p><p> </p><p>"I waited for you every day. I always knew you would come," Nicholas said cheerfully, still holding his long-lost mother tightly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped back and buried her face in her hands.</p><p> </p><p>"I lost so much. But you... you were my greatest pain. And now you're here.</p><p> </p><p>"I've always been here. This place is my home. And it can be yours too, if you want it," replied Nicky cheerfully.</p><p> </p><p>"You must have been very afraid here alone," sniffed Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>"I wasn't alone!" the little boy replied with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>Then there was a knock at the door. Agatha looked up and saw Rio Vidal standing on the threshold. This time it was the Rio she had once fallen in love with. She was wearing comfortable pants and a green sleeveless top, and part of her hair was tied up. There was a gentle smile on her face.</p><p> </p><p>"I've been waiting for you. We've both been waiting," she said softly as she stroked the boy's hair.</p><p> </p><p>"Is this... real? Or is it just a dream my mind has created to make it less painful?" Agatha asked in a hushed voice.</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed sweetly.</p><p> </p><p>"It can be real if you want it to be. You can stay with us."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha suddenly didn't know what to say. It was all too good to be true.</p><p> </p><p>"Come on, Mama! I'll show you my room!" the boy exclaimed enthusiastically, taking Agatha by the hand.</p><p> </p><p>The interior of the hut was like a lost memory come to life. Warm wooden walls, soft lighting, everything seemed familiar to Agatha, even though she had never been here before. Nicolas excitedly showed her everything, the toys he had received from Rio, his little wooden crown, and the bookshelf decorated with lots of flowers. Agatha just stood there, listening to her son's words with emotion, but her eyes kept wandering back to Rio, who was leaning against the kitchen counter, watching them quietly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mama, look, I drew this for you!" said Nicky, handing her a piece of paper.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took it and her tears flowed even more when she saw that there were three of them in the drawing. They were happy, sitting in the grass and playing together.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, Nicky, it's beautiful!" she laughed and cried with joy at the same time.</p><p> </p><p>"Go get the... you know what" Rio winked at the boy, who eagerly ran to another room.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned quietly to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>"It's too beautiful. Too perfect. Things like this... don't last long. Not in my life" she said with concern in her voice.</p><p> </p><p>Rio slowly and gently stepped closer to her.</p><p> </p><p>"This is not the world you know. But it's not a dream, and it's not your life. It's ultimate peace."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked down at her hands. Then at the flames dancing in the fireplace. At the home she never dared to imagine. At the boy she had gotten back and the woman she still loved madly.</p><p> </p><p>"What if I mess it up again? What if... everything falls apart again?" she asked in a trembling voice.</p><p> </p><p>It won't. You've already been freed from your sins. Accept your reward and stay with us. Stay with me. Rio didn't come too close, but her gaze reflected longing.</p><p> </p><p>Silence. The air around them was tense. Agatha looked up and met Rio's gaze. It was a moment when words were no longer needed. When their bodies, their past, everything whispered what they had buried for years.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>I want to kiss you.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>I want to touch you.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took only half a step forward. Rio also moved. The space between them almost vibrated. Heartbeats, memories, and desire mingled within it. The attraction was almost painful, and they both knew that if they kissed now, there would be no turning back.</p><p> </p><p>"I don't know if I want to stay here..." Agatha said, barely audibly.</p><p> </p><p>"Stay. Nicky is here, you can be with him again. Forget your guilt. You don't have to hide anything from me anymore" Rio whispered gently, but inside she was raging.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's eyes filled with tears, but not from guilt this time. It was from the wild, raw desire that had been smoldering inside her for so many years. Rio leaned carefully toward her ear, and her warm breath sent a shiver down Agatha's spine as she whispered</p><p> </p><p>"If I kiss you... will you stay?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed deeply in response, her voice trembling:</p><p> </p><p>"If you kiss me... I may never be able to let you go."</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled and their lips almost touched. The world seemed to stop, but they didn't kiss. Not yet. Something was still holding them back. One last question, one last decision that Agatha had to make. Meanwhile, Nicolas' laughter could be heard in the background as he returned to the room.</p><p> </p><p>"I found it!" he exclaimed joyfully.</p><p> </p><p>In his hand was a crown similar to Rio's, but slightly different in shape. He handed it to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>"Mommy and I made this for you" he said with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was moved and placed it on her head, hugging the boy tightly once more. She held him as if she were still afraid of losing him again. Rio watched them smiling, and then remembered that she had something to do.</p><p> </p><p>"I have to go. I'll be back in the evening."</p><p> </p><p>"Bye, Mommy! Nicky waved.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew that Rio had to do her job, but she suddenly felt afraid of being left alone with her son. It was one of the things that still made her feel guilty, but Rio's reassuring glance gave her strength before she walked out the door. The house was completely silent. Agatha knew that the time had come. She had to tell him.</p><p> </p><p>"Nicky... I want you to know... that I ruined everything," she began, sitting down on the carpet next to the little boy "I could have saved you from death, but I didn't. I only thought of myself, even though you were the person I loved most in the whole world..."</p><p> </p><p>"And Mommy" added Nicky.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, of course, Mommy too. The point is, it was all my fault. I was a terrible mother, and I don't expect you to forgive me. I did so many terrible things..." Agatha's voice broke, and tears began to fall from her eyes. Nicky listened quietly. "It was all my fault. I thought I was doing the right thing by taking you away from Mommy, but I was wrong. She's a much better mother for you, and there's no excuse for what I did. I'm so sorry, Nicky!" Agatha cried.</p><p> </p><p>"It's okay, Mama!" Nicky just smiled.</p><p> </p><p>"You... you're not mad at me? That I couldn't save you? That I was selfish and only cared about power?" Agatha looked down at the little one, sniffling.</p><p> </p><p>"No. I love you very much, and you were a good mother. I wish we could have spent more time together, but I wasn't alone. Mommy took care of me, and we waited for you" Nicky explained, stroking his mother's hair as she used to.</p><p> </p><p>Tears welled up in Agatha's eyes again. She was very relieved that Nicky wasn't angry with her and had never thought that Rio had been watching over him in this place all along. Her heart ached. If she had known... She had hurt Rio all along, she had been ungrateful. It never occurred to her that she was protecting and watching over their son from the afterlife. She had always made sure that he was never afraid and never alone. Agatha felt terrible for pushing Rio away and hurting her. How could she deserve this dream life after all that?</p><p> </p><p>"Mama, do you remember that song we used to sing together?" Nicky asked with a smile. "Down, down, down the Road, down the wind-y Road..."</p><p> </p><p>"How could I forget?" Agatha smiled, sniffing, and they sang it together.</p><p> </p><p>They played and laughed all afternoon, and Agatha was just giving Nicky a bath. Bubbles floated in the air and the boy happily popped them. Suddenly, his gaze fell on the door. He burst into cheers and jumped out of the tub, splashing Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>"Mommy!" he shouted enthusiastically and ran over to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>"Hi, little buddy!" she said with a laugh as she grabbed Nicky's towel and wrapped it around his wet body.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled as she watched Rio take him by the hand. Their eyes met. After they dressed Nicky, Agatha went to take a shower while Rio took care of making dinner. It didn't take long. Agatha put on the purple nightgown that Rio had laid out for her, and when she came downstairs, the table was already set. In the meantime, the green witch had also changed into her pajamas, which consisted of a loose gray T-shirt and dark green shorts. They both tied their hair up and had dinner together. Nicky did most of the talking, while Agatha didn't know what to say, and the atmosphere between them became tense. After dinner, she helped Rio with the dishes, and no matter how hard she tried, her gaze always drifted to her. Every time their eyes met, it was as if something stirred. Despite the awkward tension, they spent a little more time with Nicky until he became so sleepy, that Rio had to carry him upstairs. As much as Agatha wanted to do it herself, she let her lover put him to bed. They both kissed Nicky and closed the door.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you" Agatha whispered unexpectedly.</p><p> </p><p>"For what?" Rio asked in surprise.</p><p> </p><p>"I talked to Nicky today, and he told me that you took care of him and that he was never alone. I never thought about that." I'm sorry, my love, I hurt you, even though you did everything right for him," Agatha said, the last drop of guilt flowing out of her as she uttered these words. "But why didn't you tell me? That you were taking care of him?"</p><p> </p><p>"I would have told you, but I can't tell the living what happens here in the afterlife" Rio replied softly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's heart sank.</p><p> </p><p>"Can you forgive me?"</p><p> </p><p>Silence fell over the house. Rio just smiled and headed for the bedroom. Agatha followed her silently, but she couldn't hold back much longer. The lamplight spread warmly, painting the wooden beams and soft fabrics golden. Everything in the room was familiar... yet strange. It was another world they could have created together, but never did. Rio stood by the window and Agatha stopped behind her. She didn't speak, just looked at the woman she had once lost and now saw again. Her hands rested at her sides, but every muscle was tense.</p><p> </p><p>"You're just as beautiful as you used to be" Agatha said softly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped closer, her face impassive. Agatha was now able to see her up close for the first time. There was love in her eyes, rekindled. She was no longer afraid. Her hand moved and at first she touched Rio's arm gently with her fingertips, as if afraid it would vanish. Her skin was warm and alive. Rio did not move. She was in no hurry. She let Agatha rediscover her again. Her gaze slid down from her face to her collarbone, her neck, then back to her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"Does your body remember me?" Rio asked, her voice full of longing.</p><p> </p><p>A smile flitted across Agatha's lips, painful and happy at the same time.</p><p> </p><p>"Every inch of me."</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio reached out to her. Slowly, deliberately, as if she didn't want to scare her away. Her fingers caressed Agatha's face, then she untied her hair, which slowly fell onto her shoulders. They just looked at each other.</p><p> </p><p>"I want to touch you... like I used to. But now for real" Rio ran her fingers down her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just nodded. Their hands intertwined, then Rio sat down on the edge of the bed, and Agatha followed. They sat next to each other, their knees touching. Silently. The closeness was enough to make the air sparkle. Then Rio took Agatha's hand and stroked it, slowly, carefully. As if apologizing with every movement. Agatha's fingers ran down Rio's neck, over her shoulder, and then rested on her cheek. She traced the features of the woman she could never get out of her heart with her fingers. Agatha was unable to think clearly and no longer wanted to hold back. She gently but firmly took Rio's face in her hands and leaned closer. Their lips finally met in a passionate kiss. This was the moment they had both been longing for for centuries. Rio grabbed Agatha's waist and pulled her closer so that their bodies were entwined.</p><p> </p><p>"I missed you" Agatha whispered into Rio's ear.</p><p> </p><p>"I know" Rio smiled and kissed her again as they fell onto the bed.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm afraid I don't deserve you, and I don't deserve him either" Agatha said, breaking the kiss.</p><p> </p><p>"You don't have to be perfect for me to love you. Just be yourself. And now you finally are."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and bit her lip. "I love you, Rio!" The long-suppressed words left her mouth softly.</p><p> </p><p>"I love you too, my love!" Rio pressed their lips together again. "And now I want you to feel it..."</p><p> </p><p>Their clothes fell silently from them, like old wounds that no longer hurt. And when they finally came together, body and soul, everything that had ever belonged together. Soft sighs filled the room, and at last nothing stood between them. Agatha's fingers rested on Rio's chest, and she held her breath for a moment. Rio's palm rested on her waist, as if she didn't dare to touch her more strongly. But then there was no need for hesitation. The fire reflected on their skin, their bodies' curves merging with the shadows. Small, warm sounds, faltering breaths, and long glances filled the space, breaking the silence. The passion did not explode, but rather grew slowly and softly, like embers. When they finally lay entwined in each other's arms, Rio's fingers played with Agatha's hair, and she buried her head in the crook of her neck, as if she had finally found her way home.</p><p> </p><p>"Have you decided to stay now?" Rio asked quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn't answer right away. She just ran her fingers along Rio's ribs, then whispered a barely audible but firm word:</p><p> </p><p>"Yes. I've never wanted anything else. I want to stay here. For eternity, remember?"</p><p> </p><p>"I remember everything," Rio whispered happily.</p><p> </p><p>"So... you have your own house in the afterlife. With a magical garden and a comfortable bed..." Agatha playfully stretched out on the sheet for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>"Sometimes people deserve a little luxury even after life. And anyway... it's not every day that my old love, whom I thought I had lost forever, drops in" Rio replied with a laugh.</p><p> </p><p>"I want to be your lover again" Agatha declared.</p><p> </p><p>"You always have been" Rio said, kissing her forehead.</p><p> </p><p>"What if I wake up tomorrow and all of this is gone?" Agatha asked anxiously.</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed.</p><p> </p><p>"I thought the last few minutes were real enough for you to believe it's real."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed and felt somewhere that it would always be this way.</p><p> </p><p>"You won't lose anyone anymore. Not me, not Nicky. We'll go to bed together every night, and when you wake up, I'll always be here." Rio held Agatha closer and heard her sigh with relief. They both relaxed on the bed and caressed each other gently until sleep overtook them.</p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p>Time has lost its meaning in this world. Days do not pass, new dawns do not come, only soft light, warmth, and quiet security remain. The little hut stands on the edge of the afterlife, but inside it is filled with life and love. Agatha sits on the porch, a steaming mug of tea in her hand, her hair gently ruffled by the breeze. In the garden, Nicky laughs as he tries to catch a flying leaf with a magic spell. Rio sits on the steps, elbows resting on her knees, smiling as she watches his son. Agatha glances at her. Their eyes meet, and that glance says it all: the pain of the past, the sins of the years, the loss, the rebirth... and the deep, sincere love that nothing can break.</p><p> </p><p>"This is our home" Agatha whispers, almost to herself, but Rio hears her.</p><p> </p><p>"And it will remain so. For as long as eternity lasts" she replies softly as she steps beside her and embraces her.</p><p> </p><p>There is no more fighting and hatred. No more struggle or escape. Just the three of them in a place where their souls can finally rest. Nature breathes quietly around the hut, and an invisible peace vibrates in the air. Agatha closes her eyes and a faint smile appears on her face. No longer do they need to worry about when time will run out, no longer do they need to fear what tomorrow will bring, because none of that matters anymore. Agatha and Rio can finally be who they always wanted to be. What was broken has been healed. What they once lost has now been found again, and their souls have found endless peace. They remain together in the refuge of love and forgiveness.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>For eternity.</em>
