<div>
<div>
<p>
      "Congratulations, you master's degree haver you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha smiled, still half asleep.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Mmm, am I being awakened by a fellow master's degree haver?" she murmured.
      <br/>
      "What an honor."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio's embrace tightened for a moment, and Agatha sighed happily.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "So," Rio said, "what are you doing the rest of your life?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Depends on the job market."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "And other than work?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha turned over and snuggled down to tuck her head under Rio's chin.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Think maybe I'll get married. Have some babies. You know, the whole package."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Any marriage prospects in mind?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Well, there was this one woman, but..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "But?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I don't know. See, she promised that first thing today she would fuck me into a state of total ecstasy, but so far we just seem to be conversing."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Foreplay,
      <em>
       mi luz
      </em>
      ," Rio breathed, and kissed the top of Agatha's head.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha thought of something she could say, something that would really get Rio going. The only issue was the meaning and how it had shifted slightly now. If she said it and things progressed as they usually might, that was great, but then after, she really would need to address the truth. Should she put a damper on their possible sex and just say what she was thinking out loud? Should she play it coy and...
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hey. Agatha, love, what's up? You feel sick or something?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "What? I... I was just..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You were making this little groaning sound. Not a good groan. Like a going-to-be-sick or something groan."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I was thinking. Probably overthinking."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Wanna share? Maybe we can think it out together or..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I want us to start trying for a baby."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Before, Rio had been stroking her back softly, but now all motion froze.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Like,
      <u>
       trying
      </u>
      trying?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Mm-hmm."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Like, as soon as possible trying?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Basically."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She felt Rio move, shifting away from her a bit, and her heart was ready to splinter into at least a million pieces. She kept her eyes closed and head down until she felt Rio's fingers under her chin.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Look at me,
      <em>
       mi amor
      </em>
      . Please?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      When Agatha opened her eyes, Rio was smiling at her, dark eyes full of softness.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You really want this?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I do."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You know if we start ahead of the wedding, there's a chance..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Plenty of people are already pregnant when they marry."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "True, but I... I don't want you to be uncomfortable or something."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I just... Want a child. Soon. I know it's probably silly and irresponsible to consider already, but..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Why? I mean, I already have a job. I make enough to support you and me and a little someone else. And there's no guarantee you'll get pregnant right away. You'll be working in the meantime. We'll save up."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You... You don't think this is a stupid idea?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Uh, me finally getting to live my dream of knocking up the most beautiful woman in the world? Hardly a stupid idea at all."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "What? Who the hell else have you been dreaming of knocking up‽"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I... You..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio rolled her eyes.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Okay, you almost got me there. You being all humble about being the hottest, sexiest, most beautiful woman..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Fucking fuck me already, Vidal."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "With pleasure, m'lady."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Then Rio's hand was between Agatha's legs, teasing her through her underwear, and they had both been so busy for weeks, no time for a lot of fooling around. Agatha thought she would pass out just from the initial contact.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Look at my pretty girl," Rio cooed, "so sensitive and wet. So needy for me. Oh, what a good girl."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      In retaliation, Agatha shoved her hand right down Rio's boxers. She found Rio's clit, swollen and throbbing, and started to tease it delicately, just gentle circles around and over at first, but then...
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Then she captured it between her middle finger and thumb, stroking it up and down.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Is my good boy so hard for me?" she whispered.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio's eyes went wide, and she nodded as a strangled sound broke from her throat.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "So hard for me. What is she thinking, hmm? Is she thinking how much she wants to breed me? How she wants to cum inside and fill me up?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Pl-please," Rio breathed, hips twitching.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She managed to push aside Agatha's panties and push two fingers into the wet, pulsing core she found; her thumb, meanwhile, was roughly rubbing Agatha's clit.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha whimpered
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "L... Looks like I'm not the only one... The only one a bit overexcited," Rio said.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Now it was an installment of their favorite competition: who can make who cum first? Rio had experience and luck on her side most often, but Agatha knew that their earlier talk gave her a very slight advantage.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Rio. Oh, Rio, I need you. Need you so bad."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You got me. I'm right here for you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I need you so deep inside me. I need you to breed me. Put your baby in my belly."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      There was a distinct hitch to Rio's breathing now, a particular motion of the hips, and Agatha knew this was going to be an easy win.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "C'mon," she whispered, "be my good boy and give me all your cum. Be my sweet, handsome boy and breed me full."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio grunted, tensed, and her hips lost any sense of rhythm as her whole body shook for a moment. Of course, that meant her hand went a little wild too, fingers shoving into Agatha a bit harder, thumb pressing and rubbing Agatha's clit in just such a way that Agatha followed her over the edge a moment later.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      In the aftermath they lay curled close together, fighting to catch their breath.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You... You cheated," Rio said.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "How so?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You know what you did, Harkness. What you said."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hey now," Agatha smirked, "can I help it if you're deeply, deeply invested in being my baby daddy?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She punctuated the question with one last gentle tug at Rio's clit, delighting in the shiver that passed through her fiancée's body.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Oh, I'll get back at you," Rio said.
      <br/>
      "Just you wait. Later tonight, I am gonna eat you out like you wouldn't believe."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Of course you are. But for now, you know the rules: first one to cum makes breakfast."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I can't guarantee more than a bowl of cereal. Christ, I'm... I'm still shaking."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Leaning in, Agatha kissed Rio warmly.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I did my job, loverboy. Now you go and do yours. You know which bowl is my favorite."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You have to let go of my clit first."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Oh, was I still hanging on to that? I'm so terribly sorry."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      With a final fond little stroke, Agatha pulled her hand free.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "There. Now go be good and get breakfast."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Yes ma'am. Right away."
     </p>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio slumped out of the lab and almost crawled into the car, grumbling softly under her breath. Work was a bitch, life was a bitch, everything was a bitch.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Well, not everything.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Grabbing her phone, Rio smiled as she pulled up Agatha's contact.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
<em>
       "Hey, are you on your way home?"
      </em>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio grinned; it was amazing to have someone so excited to see her return at the end of the day.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Just heading out, yeah. Need me to get anything on the way?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
<em>
       "No, I think we're all good over here."
      </em>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Great. See you soon."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
<em>
       "Okay. Love you!"
      </em>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Love you too."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Sighing, Rio ended the call. At least the drive home was shorter now, since they had moved into New York. May had been really kind, helping them find an apartment near her own, and life had gotten pretty good.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha was back working at the bookshop she had taken a temporary job in a few summers ago, just until she could maybe find something else, or until she ended up on maternity leave—which astonishingly would be an option, considering the place she was currently employed was a dark, hole-in-the-wall little indie bookstore.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      They had started trying for a baby in earnest not long after Agatha said she wanted to, and of course some of the effort was a lot. All the medical check-ups and testing and stuff to make sure everything was ready to go. The trying part was fun, though, so that made up for the rest.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Also, there was Halloween to look forward to. That was in just a few days, and they were invited to a couple of parties. They would probably drop by at least one for a while, but no doubt they would rush home quickly. Agatha had been randy as hell lately, and Rio was more than ready to drop everything at a moment's notice to give her what she needed.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Speaking of needed things, as she drove closer to home, Rio decided she should stop somewhere and grab a few snacky things. Things Agatha liked and had been absolutely begging for lately. Sure, they probably had some of them at home, but if Agatha had got into the supply...
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She stopped at the tiny bodega nearest their building, making her purchases quickly and then rushing slightly the rest of the way home.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Agatha?" she called, slamming into the apartment and dropping the shopping bag on the couch.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Bathroom!" came the reply.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Shucking her coat and flinging it onto the hook, Rio went to the kitchen first and gulped down half a bottle of water. When she heard soft footsteps behind her, she turned and saw Agatha. Instead of the warm, smiling welcome she had expected, however, she found her fiancée frowning at her.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Oh, you are in
      <u>
       big
      </u>
      trouble, slugger."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I... What did I..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha held something up.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Or rather you got me in trouble and now you'll have to wait on me hand and foot for the next few months."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      The frown on Agatha's face dissolved into a smile, and Rio moved to more closely examine what was being shown to her. Little white stick thing. Little bluish plus sign on it. Her gaze flickered to Agatha's.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "This..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha nodded.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "This is a positive test," Rio managed to squeak out.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "It is."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "So you... You're..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "We did it. We actually did it."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha looked so happy, and Rio felt her own joy almost bubbling over.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Agatha. We... You... Baby?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Nodding, Agatha suddenly looked nervous.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Are you..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "
      <em>
       Mi luz
      </em>
      , I'm so happy! I... Are you okay? Fuck, here, you should be sitting down, you should..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I won't break, Rio. I'm fine."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "But you... You've got..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Feeling suddenly weak, Rio crashed to her knees and threw her arms around Agatha's waist.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "My love..." Agatha whispered.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You're gonna have our baby. We... I... This is..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Why did she feel like she was about to cry? Like every ounce of positive emotion she had ever felt was about to pour out? Of course she knew happy tears, but this...
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      This was a feeling so amazing that it hurt.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Looking up, Rio smiled at Agatha.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Well hey there, Mom."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha looked so worried at first, but then she smiled too.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hey there, Dad," she whispered.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Staggering to her feet, Rio kissed Agatha hard and then just held her.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "We're gonna be parents."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "We are."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You scared?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "A little," Agatha nodded.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Me too. But we're gonna ace this, okay? We're gonna be the best damn parents."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      A knock at the door interrupted their quiet moment.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I ordered takeout," Agatha mumbled against Rio's shoulder.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You go sit down," Rio said, "and I'll get the door."
     </p>

<div>
<p>
      They were up late that night, too nervous to sleep because of their news. At least the next day was a Sunday, so they would both be free to sleep in.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Can't believe we did it," Rio murmured for about the 40th time, her palm resting lightly on Agatha's belly.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "We did," Agatha nodded, "and we... We're gonna be a family."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I love you so much, Agatha. Like, I love you so much sometimes I don't know what to do."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Just keep loving me. Keep loving me as much as I love you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      At some point, Rio slid down the bed and lay between Agatha's legs, head pillowed on her thigh, finger tracing shapes on her belly.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "What..." Agatha wondered, because she could tell the tracing had purpose.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I'm writing messages to our little one," Rio explained, "but I have to write the letters backward so they look right inside."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "My love, I don't think baby can see anything yet, let alone something all the way on the outside. And even if they could, I don't think they can read."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Ah, they're our kid. They're gonna be wicked smart."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Laughing, Agatha carded her fingers through Rio's hair.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "What are you saying to them?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio smiled up at Agatha.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "That we're really stoked to meet them. That they're gonna have a great life with us as their parents, and that our life is gonna be awesome because we'll have them for a kid."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Tears prickled to Agatha's eyes. She never failed to be entranced by this wonderful person who had won her heart.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You want me to pass on any messages?" Rio asked.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Just... Just tell them Mommy says hello. And that I love them already."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio sat up, moving to lie properly beside Agatha.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Actually, I bet they already know anything you wanna tell 'em. 'Cause you're right there with 'em all the time. Prob'ly they can hear that your heart beat's happy about them."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "What?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Nothin'. Nutty stuff."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "No, tell me. What..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "It's this thing Lenny was saying last week. You know last time I went to see her an' Janine where they're living?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha nodded. Rio's twin sister was living in a sort of community for people with mental health conditions who were well enough to not be hospitalized, but who needed some support. Lenny had made friends there, and even picked up a girlfriend.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "So I was talking to 'em, and ya know, Janine's about a month from having the baby, and Lenny's just... She's just over the moon about the whole thing. She says, ever since they found out Janine's pregnant, she would lie awake sometimes at night with her head on Janine's chest, and it seemed to her like Janine's heart was beating happier than ever. And yes, before you ask, everything's medically fine, so it's not, like, a heart condition or something."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha giggled a little, and Rio leaned in for a kiss.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "So I was thinking," Rio said, fingers lacing fondly through Agatha's.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Uh-oh. Dangerous."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Ha ha, Harkness. No, but I was... I was talking to Dr. Isley the other day, about the wedding and stuff, and she said if we want, for the honeymoon, we can use the place she and Dr. Quinzel have down in Connecticut. It's just a little cottage place, but it's in the country and it's real nice, from the pictures in Dr. Isley's office."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Really? Oh, Rio, that would be amazing."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Yeah, I thought so too. Should I say we'll take 'em up on it?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "If you think it's a good idea."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I do. You deserve more honeymoon then us just mooching around the apartment with a week off work."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I'd be perfectly happy with that too. I'm happy with anything, so long as we're together."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I know. I'm happy just being with you too. But I like doin' stuff for ya. An' especially now... Well now, you won't just be my wife. Now you're the mother of our child. I wanna do all the good things for our family."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You're a complete sweetheart, Rio Vidal."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio sighed and smiled.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I can't be anything else when it comes to you, Agatha Harkness."

<div>
<p>
      Rio was nervous as shit, but she managed to tamp it down as they drove to the medical complex. It was not until they were in the waiting room that her feet started jittering around under her chair as she sat. Agatha, holding her hand, squeezed it gently.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Rio, how are you even more nervous than I am?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I just... We're gonna see our kid. Course I'm nervous."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      When they were called back, Rio suddenly felt all of the nervous drop out, replaced but utter panic. What if things looked bad? What if something was wrong? What if... What if... What if...
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      No. No way. This was great, and everything would be good. The baby would be there, a weird little bean of a thing at this stage, and they would see it and that would be amazing. Then they would go home and Rio would spend all day doing what she had spent all of her free time doing since the positive test: pampering Agatha.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      The exam room was calming, walls a soothing pale, pale lavender, lights just a little dimmer than out in the waiting room or the corridors. Agatha sat up on the exam table, humming softly to herself, and Rio stood by, holding her hand, occasionally kissing it. When the sonographer entered, there were a few moments of discussion and medical questions, then everything was very much happening.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Once the sonographer turned the screen toward them, Rio found herself staring. At first everything was just sort of blurs, but then as the sonographer pointed things out, her heart skipped a beat.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      There it was: the baby. It was a little bug-bean-alien thing, but it was their baby. She tightened her grip on Agatha's hand ever so slightly, and felt the pressure returned.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "So for now, things look pretty good," the sonographer said.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Then for a while they were alone in the room again, and Agatha burst into tears against Rio's shoulder.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Agatha, what..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I just... Can't believe that we just saw our baby."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You okay?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I'm... I'm happy. Just a little overwhelmed, is all."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Understandable. Shit, I mean, this just... This makes it even more real, doesn't it? Like that... We made that. That tiny little creature."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      By the time the doctor arrived to go over everything with them and send them on their way, they were both much calmer. They ended up having to sit in the car for a while before heading home, still overwhelmed with emotion.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Once they were home again, they sat together on the couch, staring at the images of their child.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Look at them," Rio said, "just in there, being our kid."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Her throat ached for the shedding of tears, but she held back. Agatha leaned against her, head on Rio's shoulder, and sighed.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "It's funny. They're just so tiny, but they seem like the most important thing in the world."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "They are important,
      <em>
       mi luz
      </em>
      ," Rio said, "because they're ours. They're a sign of how much we love each other. We have so much love that there's more than enough to share with them."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Turning aside, Rio kissed Agatha's forehead. They were headed vaguely toward some sort of greater future, together.

<div>
<p>
      "Nervous?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha nodded.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Just a little."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Scared?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Not at all. You?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio shrugged.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Kinda nervous, but mostly I'm excited. In 20 minutes, we'll be married. Not that I need that to know I want to spend the rest of my life with you, but this way the world knows it too. All that legal shit, ya know."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha laughed and took Rio's hand.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Think we'll feel any different, being married?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Maybe," Rio said, "but I know one thing that'll always be the same is how much I adore you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You're gonna make me blush."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Well, I mean, you're my blushing bride. And, lest we forget..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio knelt down and rested her forehead against Agatha's abdomen.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Mother of my child."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha smiled, closing her eyes.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I'm gonna cry. Am I supposed to cry before we even get married? I thought that was more an ecstatic thing during the ceremony."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio looked up and shrugged, standing.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I dunno. New to all this marriage stuff. Ya know, I've never even been to a wedding that I remember?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Not ever?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I mean, I was at a wedding, once, but I was a baby, so I don't remember really. Saw pictures, though."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "So, your first time consciously attending any form of wedding..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Will be our wedding. Yes."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Well. I mean, I'm glad we opted for the quick a-few-friends-and-relatives scenario, because I would hate to think you'd end up overwhelmed or something."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Do... Did you want a bigger wedding? Because you were the one who said we ought to go for..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Rio, no. No. This is the wedding I want, and I hope it's what you want."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I want whatever you want. As long as I'm wearing my snazzy suit, I'm good to go. Also, I would like to state for the record that your dress—gorgeous."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Aw, my love, thank you. You've said that every day since I settled on this one..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Let a guy overcompliment her wife's wedding dress, okay? Yeesh."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<hr/>
</div>
<p>
     The ceremony was lovely, and when it was done they had a quick wedding brunch with their guests and then hopped into the car for the drive down to Connecticut. For the first hour of the trip, things were pretty smooth, but then Agatha felt it: nausea setting in.
    </p>
<div>
<p>
      She had been pretty lucky so far, suffering only occasional bouts of mild morning sickness, but she always wanted to be prepared. As soon as she knew it was going to happen, she slammed open the glove box and grabbed one of the airsick bags she had stowed there for just such occasions.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Agatha?" Rio asked.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I'm..." Agatha managed, but her attempt at the word "fine" was lost in a wave of illness.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Shit. Want me to pull over?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "N-no. Just keep... Keep going."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She did sense Rio braking slightly, then carrying on at a reduced speed, but that was fine. Everything was fine.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      By the time they reached the cottage, she felt much better, though tired. Rio carried her inside and settled her on the sofa.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Just relax. I'll get the luggage in and then we'll go lie down a while."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I'm fine, really. You shouldn't do everything, I..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Let me take care of you,
      <em>
       mi luz
      </em>
      . Let me take care of you and our child."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha relaxed a little, smiling and holding Rio's hand to her cheek.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I love you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I love you too," Rio smiled, and leaned down to kiss Agatha's forehead before going out to get their bags.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<hr/>
</div>
<p>
     Agatha dozed off on the couch, but when she woke again she was in bed, Rio sleeping at her side. She stretched a little, then rolled over and sat up. She had to pee pretty badly. She actually felt overfull and crampy.
    </p>
<div>
<p>
      "Uck," she spat.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Felt like she had strained something stretching. 22 years old and she was straining herself just stretching before getting out of bed.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hmm, you okay?" Rio murmured, turning toward her.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Just gotta go to the bathroom. Fucking pulled a muscle stretching, too."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Ugh, that sucks. You... Oh, shit!"

</div>
<div>
<p>
      Before she knew it, Rio had run around the bed and was gently guiding her to her feet.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hang on to me, okay? Gonna take you to the car."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I need to... Fuck, I've got these cramps..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Cramps? She should not be having this sort of cramping right now, should she? She turned aside a little and saw on the bedsheets what had led to Rio's panic.

<p>
      The car nearly fishtailed into the parking lot, but Rio corrected enough to pull them through safely, then brought the car to a screeching halt in front of the entrance.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Just hang tight," she muttered, hopping out and running around to help Agatha out.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Well, she could simply have helped Agatha out. Despite the pain, there had been no evidence of difficulty in walking. Still, Rio scooped her wife of less than 24 hours out of the car and carried her into the hospital.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I need some help over here! Hey, can I... Can I get some help‽"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Someone finally approached, asked what was going on, and got a mile-a-minute rattle from Rio.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "My wife, she's pregnant and she's in a lot of pain and bleeding and something's really wrong and..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      And then they took Agatha from her—bloodied sheet from the bed at the cottage and all—and she found herself shuffled off to some waiting area. She sat there in a shitty, rickety chair with shitty, crackling plastic upholstery, and tried to ignore the blood—Agatha's blood—on her clothes. At some point someone came along, told Rio it might be a while and that she should run home and change.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I... I can't, please, I can't leave her, she... We're not even from here, we're on our honeymoon. I... I have to be here if she needs me. She might need me and if I'm not here for her, for her and the baby, I..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      The someone bent some rules for her, took her to another area and gave her some scrubs to change into, even pointing her toward a shower so she could clean up and giving her a bag for her own clothes.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She showered off and put on the scrubs and then she was in another waiting area, more of a little room with some nicer chairs and a couch and dim lighting. At one point she curled up on the couch, realized she was in the fetal position, and felt weird enough to sit back up and stay sitting up.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Finally, a few dozen eternities later, a doctor turned up and asked her if she was Rio Vidal, if Agatha Harkness-Vidal was her wife.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Yeah, that... I'm Rio. Please, is Agatha..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      And the doctor said Agatha was fine, weak and temporarily under mild sedation, but fine. They would keep her for a day or so, just for observation and to make certain everything had passed.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Passed?" Rio croaked.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      The doctor said a lot of things. "Spontaneous abortion, or more commonly miscarriage," and "anencephaly," and "happens sometimes, nothing to be done for it in the moment," and "you did all you could bringing her here."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      That last part really punched Rio in the gut. Did she do enough? Should she have known something was wrong sooner and somehow brought Agatha to the hospital faster? What if this was all her fault? What if she had done something wrong, had not taken care of Agatha enough, had not made certain that she had everything she needed?
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Eventually they let her go and see Agatha, who was awake but still a bit dozy from medication.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hey,
      <em>
       mi luz
      </em>
      . I... I'm here, okay?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Rio?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "What? What can I do for you?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Rio, they... They had to take the baby away."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I know. I know. You're gonna be okay, though."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "But I lost the baby. I... I thought I did it all right, but..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You did everything just right,
      <em>
       cariño
      </em>
      . You were perfect. The doctor says sometimes things just... Just don't work out."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "But I... Am I bad?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "No. No, you're never bad."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I lost the baby..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      All Rio could do was perch carefully on the edge of the hospital bed and hold Agatha, reassuring her over and over that none of it was her fault. That it was just the hand they had been dealt.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Yet somehow, Rio could not help but feel there must be fault, and somehow it was her own.

<div>
<p>
      Therapy helped. Of course Agatha had already been seeing a therapist for years, since she started undergrad. In the last few years, she had even felt safe enough to begin working on some of the deeper issues from her childhood in therapy.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      When she went in for her first session after being back in New York and recuperating for two months, the first words out of her mouth had sketched a new roadmap for the bulk of the next four months of therapy.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Look, Doc. I... I'm not even a mother and I already failed at being one. My baby died inside me; I couldn't even keep them safe in my own body. I'm literally already a worse mother than my own."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Doctor MacTaggert had sat there in silence for a moment, not even scribbling anything on her notepad, before addressing Agatha's comments.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Why do you say you're not a mother?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Well, I mean, I made it three months into a pregnancy and then failed out."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "It's not like school, Agatha. You didn't fail out of a course or something. You suffered a miscarriage."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Yeah, because my body failed at properly making and sheltering my child. Now I have no child."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Would you say a woman whose child died as an infant is not a mother?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "No. No, of course not. I mean..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Would you say a woman whose child was stillborn at full term is not a mother?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "No."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You wanted this child very much, you and your wife?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Of course. We... We've always wanted to have children. We were so excited..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I recall your excitement, and your worry, during our earlier sessions. But tell me: if you lost a very wanted, a very hoped for pregnancy, if you already loved your baby, which you said you did, how are you not a bereaved mother, at least of a sort?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha had never fully fallen in line with that thinking, but it did lead her to begin examining aspects of what had happened and how she had reacted.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She knew very well what the medical reports said: anencephaly. A not uncommon issue that could have many causes. The reports said, after examination of all the facts and the medical records, there was no indication that this case was caused by any inaction or incorrect action on the part of Agatha. There was some mention of the possibility that perhaps signs of trouble had been missed on the initial sonogram, but still, no fault of Agatha's.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Six months out, she was beginning to accept it. She was beginning to believe she had not failed. Things just went wrong sometimes. Aspects of the world were beyond control.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      The world kept spinning. Life kept going. She and Rio were happy personally and professionally. The one thing Agatha never felt, which her reading into the matter mentioned was common, was that Rio might in any way blame her for their loss.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "
      <em>
       Mi luz
      </em>
      , we both wanted the baby so much. You were so, so careful. Of course this isn't your fault."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio was always at her side, supportive and gentle and loving. Of course, some things changed. It was quite a while before either of them felt comfortable initiating lovemaking again. Rio said she just wished to be certain Agatha would not be hurt. Agatha wanted to know that Rio was not disgusted by her.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "How could I ever be disgusted by you, Agatha? You're my perfect woman. Nothing can change that."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Your child died inside of me, Rio. Your child was born cold and dead from my body."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio simply shrugged at that.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "How would that make me love or want you any less? What happened was terrible and scary, but it wasn't your fault and didn't change my feelings for you, except maybe to make me need to be sure I take care of you more. That I make sure you always know how I love you, and how I'll always try to keep you safe."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Eventually they did make love again. There was a new softness to it. They had always been sweet to each other, and the emotions expressed had always been tender, but now things seemed even gentler somehow. Not that there was never any edge to what they did now, but some aspects vanished almost entirely, at least in those early months.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio seemed reluctant to use the strap on Agatha anymore, and their talk in bed changed as well. More and more often, Agatha sensed Rio holding back, not saying things she typically would. No more talk of making babies or anything like that. Of course, all of that had vanished at first during the pregnancy, but now Agatha wondered if it would ever come back.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      One night, near the six month mark after that horrible day, they were having dinner, and Agatha realized Rio was staring at her across the table.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Everything all right, my love?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio nodded.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You just look... I dunno. You just look really beautiful tonight."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Thank you. You look beautiful too."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Thanks. But, like, Agatha... You look stunning, somehow. Like... Like..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Like let's put away the dinner and eat each other out instead?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio stood so quickly she knocked her chair over.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I'm into it!"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      They rushed through putting the food away, rushed to bed, and feasted on one another needily, greedily, in a way they had not in months.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha felt herself fully relax into Rio's touch, into the rough heat of Rio's tongue against her folds, and she came hard three times, mind briefly fogging with bliss.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She was equally delighted when Rio got a little rough with her, fingers tight in her hair, hips bucking hard at her mouth as Rio begged to be sucked. Rio was shy about certain kinds of talk even at the best of times—some kind of shame around gender performance, Agatha had decided—and lately she had been downright silent during sex, but tonight she was letting loose.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Fuck yes! Good girl, just like that. Yeah, suck it... Right... There... Fuck! You like that? You gonna swallow my load, my good girl?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha stopped, pulled away, decided it was now or never.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Rio..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "W-why'd you stop? Shit, did I hurt you? Was I..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "No, my love, but I..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha crawled up to stretch out on top of Rio, kissing her gently.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I don't wanna swallow tonight, sweetheart."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I... I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... I won't..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Shhh, my love," Agatha whispered, and silenced Rio with another kiss.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio's eyes were wide, glassy, and she looked so in need. Agatha smiled.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I think you know what I want, beautiful," Agatha said.
      <br/>
      "What I've been missing from you."

<p>
      "Don't wanna hurt you," Rio whispered, hands coming up to cradle Agatha's face for a moment.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You won't, my love. I promise you won't. You're good to me. You never hurt me."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You really want this again? I mean, you feel..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I love you, I want you, and I want to do this, but only if you want it too."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio wanted it. Shit, she wanted to fuck Agatha slow and easy until they were both worn out. It was so scary, though. She kept thinking she might cause some harm, that she had been the one to somehow cause harm and end their baby. Everyone said that was nothing to do with it: doctors, her therapist, Agatha, the therapist they had seen together for a few sessions.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      It was not her fault.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      But still, Rio had to wonder if she had destroyed that dream they had worked so hard for. If she had taken a little piece of the future from the woman she loved.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha was here, now, and they had been making love so beautifully, but Rio had said a dumb thing, and now Agatha wanted something that yes, had long been a part of their lovemaking, but which Rio now knew she would only screw up. She would say something else stupid, something careless, and it would hurt Agatha, would do her harm, would...
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "We won't do it, sweetheart, if you don't want to," Agatha said, and she was so soft, lying on top of Rio, hugging her, nuzzling at her collarbones.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I want to. I... I wanna fuck you so much. Just... Just wanna be careful."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "What would make you feel safe?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio felt shaky. She was supposed to be the protector in the relationship, the strong one who made sure Agatha always felt safe.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Of course, she had failed at that six months ago. Failed like a champ.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "It's okay, my love," Agatha cooed, sliding off of Rio and snuggling against her side.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I... Will you put the harness on me? And... And you be on top, so I know I'm not hurting you?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Is that how you want it, my handsome boy?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Y-yeah," Rio said, shivering happily at the endearment.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Then Agatha was gone from her side for a moment, and Rio whimpered. Being apart, even just a physically short distance, hurt. Of course Agatha returned to her quickly, hands and voice all soft while slipping the harness around Rio's hips and getting the cock settled into place.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "There we go," Agatha murmured, and she was stroking her hand up and down the cock in a way that made Rio feel wild with need.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Can I... Can I fuck you?" Rio whispered.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hope you will. You feel safe?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "As long as you do."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha straddled Rio, leaning down to kiss her.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I always feel safe with you, my love."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      And then she moved back, and she sank onto the cock with a practiced, fluid motion that made Rio grunt, then moan, hands flying to Agatha's hips.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I almost forgot how pretty you look split open on my cock," Rio murmured.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She slid a hand over, letting the thumb press against Agatha's clit. Agatha gasped, hips rocking forward slightly.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Missed feeling you in me so deep," she moaned.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Then she was rocking her hips, back-forward, back-forward, and Rio instinctively bucked up, trying to push in deeper despite being bottomed out.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "That's it," Agatha said.
      <br/>
      "That's my good, beautiful boy."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio's eyes almost rolled back, and she moved her thumb more aggressively over Agatha's clit.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "My good girl," Rio sighed, "taking me so good. So pretty and wet for me."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      The motions were speeding up, Agatha no longer just rocking, but now moving subtly up and down, moaning almost endlessly as Rio pressed and circled her clit. Rio smirked, fucking up hard into Agatha's downward motions, her own clit aching for release beneath the harness.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Keeping her right hand busy with Agatha, Rio pushed up on her left elbow.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You are so, so beautiful when you ride me, Agatha. Fuck, look at you. My gorgeous wife."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Oh, shit. Tears. Agatha was crying. Rio panicked, sitting up and trying to hold her.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "
      <em>

     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I missed you so much," Agatha whispered.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio sighed, relieved, and felt tears prick at her own eyes. This felt safe and good. It felt like they had been so far apart for a while, but they were moving back toward each other.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "My good girl," Rio said, "can I lay you down?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "P-please."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Carefully, Rio shifted, curling her legs in, twisting, kneeling up with Agatha clinging to her, then easing down on top of Agatha, their heads toward the foot of the bed. This was something they had managed a time or two before, but this time the cock did not slip out once.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Fuck," Agatha muttered, "fuck me good, my love."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio could see she was close: eyes hazy, panting and gasping, fingers clawing at Rio's shoulders.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "W-want me to pull out?" Rio asked, suddenly worried about her thoughts, about what she might say when she herself came.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "No, please. Please, I need it inside me. Every bit of you, inside me."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio felt herself blush, thrusting harder. Her wife was a little minx who knew just how to talk her around. Pressing in hard, she ground her hips, driving forward against Agatha's clit.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She felt it. The tightening of Agatha's embrace around her, the sudden difficulty of thrusting for a moment as everything clenched, and then Agatha kissed her hard, moaning into her mouth, shivering.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Rio, I... Oh, I love you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I love you, Agatha. Love you too."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha was looking at her so softly, so sweetly, eyes still a little hazed from orgasm, and it was so good, so perfect, so...
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Gonna cum in you. Fuck, Agatha, I'm gonna..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Good, oh good. Cum for me. Rio, cum inside me. I need you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She felt like she was falling, tumbling through a soft white void, sparks shooting across her vision, muscles tight, clit throbbing, cunt twitching, and she came back to herself with her forehead pressed against the sheet, Agatha under her, stroking her hair, her back, whispering sweet things, kissing her cheek.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "My Rio. So sweet, so beautiful. I love you so much. I love you, my good boy, my Rio."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Whimpering, Rio rolled them so they were on their sides, keeping Agatha close in her arms.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Nothing to be sorry for, Rio. You did so well. Such a good job."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I love you. I always will."
     </p>

<div>
<p>
      "What would you think of a weekend in the country?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha looked up from the dishes, smiling.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "The country? I'm intrigued."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio stepped behind her, arms circling her waist lightly.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "There's a place upstate. Little resort cabins. We could go and just chill for a couple of days. Relax. Get fresh air and stuff."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Could be nice."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I can set it up, soon as you want. I was thinking next month. August. Sort of a birthday present for you?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Rio, you don't need to..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I want to. Wanna do special things for you, okay?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha turned in Rio's arms.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You're so good to me."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Yeah, well, you deserve it,
      <em>
       mi luz
      </em>
      . You deserve all the wonderful things."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio kissed her, then hugged her a little tighter.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Wanna skip out on dinner tonight?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "But you've been promising Lenny..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "We can put it off a week. Hell, she and Janine would probably be grateful to just have a quiet night."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Sighing, Agatha rest her chin on Rio's shoulder.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I won't break, Rio."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I know. I know. I just thought, ya know, Violet and all..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I can be around babies without falling to pieces, my love."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio's posture went tense, rigid even, and Agatha heard her draw in a ragged breath.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "What if I can't?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "My love..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I keep thinking... I keep wondering if there was more I could have done for you. For... For both of you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "No, Rio. There was nothing more you could have done."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I hurt you, maybe."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "No you didn't! Rio, you know it was no one's fault. I thought we were through this. Please, stop blaming yourself."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Sorry."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "It's okay, my love. Okay. Do
      <u>
       you
      </u>
      think we should skip dinner tonight?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I just... I feel really tired."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Okay. But you need to be the one to call and tell them, all right? And see if we can make it up to them another time."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I can. I will."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Good."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I love you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I love you too."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Kiss me?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio nuzzled at Agatha's neck for a moment, then pulled away a little.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Can... Can we do more than kiss?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Later tonight. For now, I want you to go call Lenny about dinner, then go and lie down and rest a while."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Will you..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I'll come and join you. Just let me finish up these dishes and everything."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Smiling, Rio leaned in and kissed Agatha. It was sweet, really, and a little possessive, and went on for ages. The longer it went, in fact, the more Agatha was tempted to forget about housework and to simply let Rio take her to bed. When Rio's thigh slipped between her own, that nearly crumbled the last of her resolve, but she held out.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I... I really need to finish cleaning up, Rio."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Right. Right. But later..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Later you can do anything you like with me. Promise."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio seemed happier, grabbing her phone from her pocket and leaving the kitchen with a hint of a bounce in her step. Agatha heard her whistling on the way to the bedroom and smiled, then went back to work tidying up.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      When Agatha later made her own way to the bedroom, she found Rio sprawled out in just a tank top and boxers, hair tousled, fast asleep. It was a beautiful sight, really; the person she loved so much, who so often seemed to want to bear the weight of the world, at total rest. Smiling, Agatha stripped down to her t-shirt and panties and crawled into the bed as well. Perhaps it was lazy to spend a Saturday afternoon napping, but she could not seem to care.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Almost as soon as Agatha had settled in, Rio grunted, rolling around and ending up pulling her into an embrace. She felt so safe then, and happy, and loved, and she had a moment of feeling like her heart was so full it would burst. That was a sensation relatively new to her, something she had really only experienced since knowing Rio. That feeling of total, blissful security in knowing how loved she was, and how deeply she loved Rio in return.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      When she woke, it was nearly nine at night, and her stomach was rumbling with hunger. She could feel Rio's warmth still against her back, and a moment after she stirred, she felt a kiss pressed to the back of her left shoulder.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I ordered Thai," Rio murmured.
      <br/>
      "Should be here in thirty minutes. Is that okay?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Perfect. Why didn't you wake me sooner?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You looked so pretty there, just asleep, all soft. Just wanted to gloat?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Gloat?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Mmm. Personal, internal gloating over how you're all mine."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      With a little laugh, Agatha snuggled back more securely into Rio's embrace.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "All yours. I love being all yours."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "And I love being all yours."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Things got a little heated for a moment, but then Rio drew away.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Gonna throw on some pants while we wait for the delivery. Don't wanna give the poor soul who shows up at our door a show. Even if these are my best boxers, really."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hmm. I prefer your green silk ones."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Those are boxer briefs,
      <em>
       mi luz
      </em>
      . You like them because of how they fit me."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha laughed.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Well, they show off your ass so well."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio nodded, struggling out of bed and pulling on an ancient pair of gray sweatpants.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I'll keep that in mind," she said, "and wear them on your birthday."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Please do."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Once the food arrived, they ate in bed, laughing over old familiar jokes and basking in each other's presence.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You sure you can get a summer cabin on such short notice, even for just a weekend?" Agatha asked when the subject came up again.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Mm-hmm. It's near the end of their main season. Plus, I know a guy. Get us a nice discount, even."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hmm. And who is this mysterious guy? Anyone I should know about?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Old foster brother. Matt. He's an attorney; the cabins are a sideline thing."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Interesting."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "He's a pretty good guy."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio never spoke extensively about her childhood. Agatha understood why; things had been difficult, even dangerous at times. But occasionally, she would mention some event or person from that part of her life, and when it was something good, she seemed positively to light up. In those moments, she was so radiant beyond even her inherent beauty that Agatha felt almost in awe.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      They watched some silly movie after dinner. Well, they had some silly movie on. Mostly Agatha lay curled up against Rio's side, Rio's arm around her, and they simply basked in the closeness. Now and then they would shift position slightly, and almost every time they did, Rio would steal a quick kiss if possible.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      When the movie was over, Agatha smiled.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I believe I promised someone they could do anything they want to me," she murmured.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You did."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Care to collect?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio nodded.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "What would you like me to do to you?" she asked, voice husky.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha laughed, fingers playing at the hem of Rio's tank top.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Your choice. Anything you want."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Anything at all?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "
      <u>
       Anything
      </u>
      ."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio smiled, nodded, and shifted around a bit nervously.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Is it... Would it be okay if, for tonight, I just hold you?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Of course. Rio, that's always okay."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I just... I love you so much. I just love to hold you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha smiled.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I love you, and I love the way you hold me."

      "You've honestly
      <u>
       never
      </u>
      been fishing?" Rio asked.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha shook her head.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Nope. Mother did drag me along on a yacht trip with some of her friends once, and I think some of the men maybe tried their hands at deep sea fishing. But I was nine years old and all I really remember is being a little seasick and Mother trying to push me into the Atlantic during a 4 a.m. tirade about my grades."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Uh..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I was always a straight A student. That was never enough for Mother, of course."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio blinked, hard.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "
      <em>
       Mi luz

      , every further revelation about your childhood only drives me closer and closer toward committing a major felony."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Well, my love, when you do, wear gloves. And maybe a ski mask."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      They both broke out laughing over that, and Rio went to open the door of the cabin and peer out into the early morning light.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Might be a good day for fishing, if you want to try."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Oh, I mean, I'll go along with you, but I'm not sure I'll be any good at it."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I'll bait your hook for you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Smiling, Agatha grabbed the back of Rio's shirt and pulled her aside from the doorway, spinning her so her back was up against the wall.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I'd rather be the bait on your hook, my love."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hmm. Someone looking to get in a little early morning stretch?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Well, I'd be open to it."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio was struck by a sudden and dire need to laugh.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Oh. Oh, no. Oh, we've..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "What? What's so funny?" Agatha demanded.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "We've crossed the line,
      <em>
       cariño
      </em>
      . We've begun to make overtures to each other exclusively in saucy yet mild innuendo."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "In... Your... Endo," Agatha struggled, and then groaned, slumping against Rio.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Are we getting old, or just weird?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "We're only in our middle 20s, so I'd say weird. Or maybe we've just limited ourselves somehow."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Right," Agatha said, pushing away and heading for the cabin's tiny kitchen, "that's it. Time we spiced things up in this marriage. I'm going to make an enormous quantity of questionable sandwiches to pack in the cooler, and then we're going out and you're teaching me to fish."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Uhm, great. Can... Can we have breakfast first?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You're in charge of breakfast today, oh great and mighty fisherman."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Awesome. Scrambled eggs it is."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Wonderful."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "And I will be putting Spam in."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You and your salt intake," Agatha scoffed.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Oh, c'mon. You love me salty."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I do. I do love you salty."
     </p>
</div>
<div>

</div>
<p>
     They caught absolutely nothing but a few mosquito bites. Still, they had a good time, meeting a few other people who were out in the other nearby cabins. Once they gave up on fishing—a bit before noon—they just sort of hung out near the lake, Agatha keeping herself well shaded with the enormous beach umbrella she had brought along.
    </p>
<div>
<p>
      "The sun is my enemy, Rio," she said when Rio laughed at her struggling to stabilize the thing.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Sure, you have fair skin, but..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "My
      <u>
       enemy
      </u>
      . I've had sunburn once in my life, and I won't have it again."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      They went back to the cabin before sunset, showered, had a quick dinner, then cozied up in bed.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Wanna fuck?" Agatha asked.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Well, this is abrupt."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "C'mon. We've gotta recapture those heady days of just saying what we want. So, do you want to fuck me?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I do. Actually quite a lot."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Good. I packed the new one. Thought we could try it out."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio cocked a brow.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Uh, sure you wanna try the new one out here? What if..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Oh, Rio, I am not some fragile fairy princess. I can handle it. I just have a sense I might get a little loud and I wouldn't want to disturb the neighbors back home."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Well," Rio snorted, "aren't you thoughtful."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I am, really."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha went and crouched down, digging through their bags for the discreet little black box. She tossed it on the bed and nodded to Rio.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Suit up, loverboy. I have to pee before you have your way with me."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Yes, m'lady."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Flipping open the box, Rio stared at the gear inside. They had purchased it online after a perhaps ill-advised evening of too much wine and some very odd but entertaining reading. Should be interesting to at least experiment with. Chuckling to herself, she got everything on, then lounged back on the bed to wait.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha returned in nothing but her robe, and it was barely closed. She already looked a little flushed, and Rio guessed she had given herself a pep talk in the bathroom. As she crawled onto the bed, she looked ravenous, her gaze dragging over Rio and then locking on the new toy.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Like what you see?" Rio asked.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Uh...uh-huh."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You want it?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I do. I do want it."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Lie down for me,
      <em>
       cariño
      </em>
      ."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "But..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Wanna warm you up first. Get you ready to take me."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      With a little huff, Agatha flopped down on her back, actually crossing her arms and pouting. Clearly, she had wanted to get straight to business, and it almost made Rio laugh. Of course, the moment she had her head down between Agatha's thighs, taking in the fragrance of her wife's arousal, all thought of anything but diving in face first left her brain.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I don't see why we can't just..." Agatha muttered, the words trailing into a high moan when Rio's tongue went to work.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Over the years of their relationship, Rio had discovered that Agatha had a deep fondness for a certain little flickering motion of the tongue right over the tip of her clit. That motion alone was, in this moment, enough to get her arms uncrossed so that she could grip the sheets, hips rising off the bed. When Rio followed up by sliding three fingers deep inside of Agatha, the moaning went up a level, broken up now and then with the sweetest sort of whimpers as Rio gently scissored the fingers open and closed to stretch things.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Then Rio went for the gold, sucking Agatha's clit hard while twisting the aforementioned fingers.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Oh fuck!" Agatha sharped.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She came as deliciously as always, though Rio did not lap up all of the slick as usual. Instead, she rose to her knees and ran her soaked hand all over the toy, slicking it up and giving Agatha a little bit of a show.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I love you so much," Agatha murmured.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "And I love you too,
      <em>
       mi luz
      </em>
      . Now turn over like a good girl."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha was far more enthusiastic about this order, rolling onto her front immediately, pulling her knees up to present herself. Smirking, Rio patted her ass softly.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "That's my good girl. Pillow."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha roughly tossed the thick bolster they had brought along back to Rio.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Just hurry up and get in me please!" she begged.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Someone was extra needy. Rio shoved the bolster under Agatha's hips and lined everything up.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Ready for me?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Yes, yes, I'm ready for... Oh my God!"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio went slow, a little at a time, but even the first bit was enough to reduce Agatha to broken whimpers as she frantically pushed back
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Just relax for me," Rio said, fighting to keep her own voice steady.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      The image of the new cock sliding into Agatha, stretching her slowly, was mesmerizing. Rio grunted, suddenly fully seeing the appeal of this cock in this position. There was something primal and maybe a little fucked up about the whole thing.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Fuck," Agatha muttered, forehead resting on her arms.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio watched all but the last bit of the toy slide in, and she groaned. Fuck indeed.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      It was like a bolt of lightning tore through Rio's mind; the next thing she knew she was bent down over Agatha's back, fucking away like there was no tomorrow.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "So wet," Rio muttered, "always so wet for me, my good girl. My good, good girl."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      It was good. Fucking good. Fucking hot.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Rio," Agatha whispered.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Wanna stop?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "No. No, don't you dare. Just... Oh, fuck. Fuck. I'm right... Right there..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio slipped a hand down past the bolster and roughly circled Agatha's clit.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Cum for me, my good girl. Cum all over my cock."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha, as she often has in the past, performs on command, crying out Rio's name and letting out another little wave of slick that leaves everything wet enough for the cock to fully slip in.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Even the part they were going to be so careful with. The part they were not going to force.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio gasped, moved as if to try and disengage, and felt Agatha grab at her wrist.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Don't. Move."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Are you hurt?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Fuck no," Agatha panted.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She squirmed her hips back in a way that made Rio grunt, then groan.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Breed me, Rio. Please, please..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Lost at the edge of her own climax, Rio pulled her hand away from Agatha's clit and managed to squeeze the little lube-filled bulb that dangled from the harness.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Shit," Rio breathed, dropping a kiss on the back of Agatha's neck.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "That was..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Yeah. Sure you're okay?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I'm fucking amazing! How are you?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "P-pretty fucking amazing."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      A half-hour later they were still awake, cuddled up close, the new toy safely tucked back away in its box.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "That one is going on the wall," Agatha sighed, running her fingers over Rio's abs.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "The wall?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "The wall of really great sex. It's how I catalog those memories in my head."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Ah. Of course."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Listen, I may be kind of weird..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "But you're just exactly my kind of weird."
     </p>
</div>

<p>
      "Rio, do you ever think about moving?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Moving what?" Rio muttered, only half-awake yet.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Moving somewhere else. Moving away from the city."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hmm? I mean, yeah. Sometimes."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha lay back against the pillows and felt Rio scoot closer to cuddle her. It was a warm, lazy sort of Sunday morning—the sort of day that almost made you
      <u>
       need
      </u>
      to sleep in, or at least lie in bed well past the usual hour.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "The bookshop is closing down."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Now Rio was more awake, moving quickly to take Agatha into her arms.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "
      <em>
       Cariño
      </em>
      , I'm so sorry. I know you love working there..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Well, things happen. The owners are retiring back home to England. We're selling off most of the stock soon, and the owner of the building is already looking who to lease to next."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "What do you think you'll do next?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I'm not sure, really. I... Well, Mr. Fell did make me an offer."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hmm?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "He... He offered to sell me some of the rarity stock at a discount, and to set me up with some of his sources and distributors."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You... You'd wanna start your own place? Your own bookshop?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha shrugged.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Just a stupid idea I had. Wouldn't work."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Why not?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Well, I... I wouldn't... I'd have to find a place, hire staff to help, I'd have to..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Is that why you brought up moving?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Nodding, Agatha turned more to Rio's embrace.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I mean, even to dream of it, I'd never be able to afford a space here in the city. Even renting would wipe most of the inheritance from my dad that I got when I turned 25."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "So we can look at places away from the city. Hell, I've always kind of wanted to live somewhere a little quieter. Out of the way, but not
      <u>
       too
      </u>
      out of the way."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "But your work..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "So I'll commute."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Rio, I don't want to be a problem for you. I... I'll find other work. And until I do, there's my inheritance and..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "And you'd really rather have your own place, wouldn't you? Be your own boss? Make the business anything you want it to be?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I mean, that would be the dream."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "So let's go for it. Hell, maybe one day I'll wanna leave the lab behind and do other stuff. Landscaping. A garden center. Whatever the fuck."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "But your research..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "So I swap over to 'Hey look at this cool hybrid I made' or something. So what? Agatha, all I need to make me happy in this life is to be with you. To have the pleasure of your company each day."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      With a sigh, Agatha relaxed into Rio's arms.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "There's a place in Westchester County. Salem Center. It's small, quiet. Could probably support a bookshop."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hmm. Sounds interesting."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "And there are some great properties around. Some good houses, or places where, if someone wanted, they could sort of build a nice one."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I like the sound of it. A quiet place for us to live and work and be together."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "And maybe... Maybe try for a baby again? One day?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Oh, that should definitely be somewhere on the agenda. Definitely. When... When you feel ready."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "What about your feelings?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I mean, I won't be the one going through all the shit, ya know? You'll be the one who carries it and gives birth. My involvement extends mostly to what some would call "the fun bit" that helps get the ball rolling."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "But you do... You do still
      <u>
       want
      </u>
      children..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Of course I do,
      <em>
       mi luz
      </em>
      . I've wanted you to be the mother of my children since... Hell, almost since I met you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "We met at the university medical center when you'd had a concussion and wound up carried out of a basketball game with my panties on your face."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Yup. And I knew the moment I met you I wanted a whole life and future with you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Aw, Rio, that... Concerns me in a way I don't entirely have words for. You know, because of the part where you were actively concussed at the time."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hey, think about how I felt. There I was, Cocklord of Westview University..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "We are completely getting rid of that fucking trophy when we move."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio grunted, but went on.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "There I was, the one member of the women's basketball team who could get basically any girl in bed, who had no deep interest in settling down, and then I get a concussion and immediately fall for the girl whose panties I accidentally stole. I spent most of our first year together wondering if everything I felt was just post-concussion syndrome."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I don't suppose you feel that way now?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "
      <em>
       Cariño
      </em>
      , I would not have married you if I did not think I was in a fit state to do so. I would not still be with you. We're real, babe. This is real. Whatever we make of life together, I want it."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha felt like she might cry. All her life she had been worthless. Unlovable. But somehow, Rio saw worth in her and was able to give her so much love. Rio was the first person to really make her feel special and safe and happy in ways she never thought she could have.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She would never understand it entirely, but she was grateful for it, and grateful that Rio was willing to accept the absolutely staggering amount of love and affection Agatha offered in return. Anyone else probably would have pulled away by now, thinking Agatha was clingy and annoying, but Rio had patience. Rio actually loved her.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hey,
      <em>
       mi luz
      </em>
      . Come back to me. You got that sad look again."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I just... I'm thinking how I don't deserve you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Well, ya got that right. You deserve way more, and I'll fight every day to give you everything I can."

<p>
      They went up at the weekend for another little inspection trip. The house was nearly complete, as was Agatha's acquisition of the small building in Salem Center that would soon be her bookshop. Rio's planned garden center was still in the early stages of construction.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I think we'll be happy here," Rio said as they walked through house.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I
      <u>
       know
      </u>
      we will," Agatha said, smiling as Rio stopped and leaned in to kiss her.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      The place smelled fresh, untouched, and Rio liked that. This would be a place that they would fill with the sights and sounds and smells of their life together, as it was and as it would be in the future. This would be home for them, and for anyone else who might happen along.

      They were not officially trying again yet; the decision had been taken to wait a year or so, until they were settled in fully to their new home and new jobs. There was plenty of time ahead of them. When they at last had a child, they would be as fully prepared as possible.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You don't think we went overboard with the house, do you?" Agatha asked.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Nah. It's just right for us and a few kids, and guests who might stop in. Sure, it'll take us a while to fill up..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Oh,
      <u>
       please
      </u>
      avoid that phrase unless you mean it."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "What, fill up?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha whimpered, and Rio smiled at her.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Wanna head back to the motel,
      <em>
       cariño
      </em>
      ? I can give you a hand. Maybe fill you up."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio leaned in to whisper that last bit, and Agatha sighed. Their cycles were pretty close, so Rio knew just why her wife was feeling so needy. Wrapping Agatha in a close embrace, she almost lifted her off her feet.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You want that,
      <em>
       mi luz
      </em>
      ? Want me deep inside you, pumping you full?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Yes, I do. Right now."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Let's hit the road then."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      It was less than a 10 minute drive back to their motel on the far side of North Salem, but Agatha fidgeted in the passenger's seat the whole way. Rio found herself anxious as well. They had been so busy lately, only having time for a few tiny moments of pleasure. This time, they had pretty much the entire weekend free, and it seemed reasonable to take advantage of that.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Slamming into the room, Rio barely had the door closed and locked before Agatha was on her, pushing her back against the door and almost climbing her. Quickly, Rio slid her hands down Agatha's sides, down the delicious swell of hips, pulling their bodies close at the crucial point.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Fuck, Rio, I need you so much."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Need you too," Rio murmured, getting her hands on Agatha's ass.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio lifted, felt Agatha's arms tighten around her neck as Agatha's legs wrapped around her waist.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I am so fuckin' ready to plow you right now, Agatha. Shit, you smell so good."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Stumbling to the bed, Rio deposited Agatha there and then got on top of her. They were both overheated, both struggling to get clothes out of the way, but the efforts were repeatedly thwarted by their need to be in physical contact. Agatha kept pulling Rio down into deep, lingering kisses, kept wrapping her legs again around Rio's waist or hips to grind their bodies together.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Need you," she whispered.
      <br/>
      "Please, Rio, I want... I want you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Lemme get these jeans off you,
      <em>
       mi luz
      </em>
      , and you'll get what you want."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio knelt up between Agatha's thighs. The jeans were tight and had to be, in the moment, peeled off so they ended up inside out. There was no time for worrying about that as the jeans, followed by Rio's shirt, were tossed onto the chair across from the bed. Leaning down, Rio felt her head spin pleasantly as she saw how damp the crotch of Agatha's panties had gotten. Her eyes almost rolled back when she got a whiff of Agatha's arousal, that so familiar warm smell of need.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She gripped the waistband of the panties with her teeth and tugged at the same moment Agatha's hips rose slightly off the bed. The panties rolled down easily to mid thigh, but then Rio left them there, drawing a frustrated moan from Agatha that cut off abruptly as Rio reached past and shoved two fingers deep into her pussy.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "There's my good girl. Oh, so tight. So good."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio set a quick pace with her fingers, curling and twisting them just right on each out stroke. With her other hand, she lightly pinched and rubbed Agatha's clit.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hhhmnm," Agatha sobbed.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "It's okay. Cum for me. Be my good girl and lemme see you cum. Pretty girl with her pretty pink pussy, all wet and hungry."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Please, please, Rio!"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha was close, shivering and bucking right at the edge of her climax, and Rio worked her closer still, almost letting her tumble over before pulling away entirely.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "N-no! Please, I need to... Please..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Patience is a virtue," Rio murmured, sliding off of the bed and stripping off most of her own remaining clothes.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Before she could get back on the bed, Rio gasped in surprise as Agatha's shirt, bra, and panties flew past her head, leaving her wife splayed naked before her.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Fuck me," Agatha begged.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio was only too happy to comply, diving back onto the bed and kissing Agatha hard, moving on to nip at her neck, kissing and licking, striving to leave a mark on the pale column.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Mine," she mumbled, and then she was nuzzling at Agatha's breasts.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She sucked hard at the right nipple, loving the way Agatha moaned and arched up toward her mouth. When Rio worried the sensitive nubbin for a moment with her teeth, Agatha hissed in a breath and pressed a hand to the back of Rio's head.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Good... So good, Rio."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      The other nipple got similar treatment, though the last nip of teeth was a little harsher than Rio intended, and Agatha actually tugged at her hair to pull her away.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Sorry," Rio whispered, planting a soft kiss to make things a little better.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Forgiven," Agatha said, "at least for the biting."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      With a smirk, Rio snaked a trail of kisses down Agatha's abdomen. When she reached the quivering, wet juncture of Agatha's thighs, she breathed in that smell again, the fragrance of Agatha's need, and moaned. Her wife needed her so much. It never ceased to amaze her just how much.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Heaven," Rio said, parting Agatha carefully and tasting her.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Every little grunt and moan, every shift of hips, the way each of Agatha's fingers tangled in her hair, was for Rio a sign of perfection. When she plunged her three fingers back into Agatha's core and heard a series of high, begging whimpers, she smiled even as her lips worked to apply soft suction to her wife's throbbing clit.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha's climax hit hard, and Rio had to lay her free arm across her wife's hips to keep things steady. Once the peak passed, Agatha stilled for a moment, sighing and whimpering, but Rio kept up a quick thrusting speed, flickering her tongue over Agatha's clit to draw out a second orgasm that made Agatha cry out Rio's name and tug at her hair so hard it almost hurt.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      As soon as she sensed everything settling, Rio moved up to kiss Agatha, plunging the cock in at the same time so that Agatha moaned into the kiss.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Yes, yes, yes," Agatha panted once Rio started to pump in and out.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Good girl. Gimme one more? Cum all over my cock?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Rio... Fuck! Please, touch..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio slid her hand between their bodies, gently stroking Agatha's clit.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Okay,
      <em>
       mi luz
      </em>
      . I gotcha. Cum one more time. Just a little one, okay? It's all okay."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      When Agatha came again, it was soft, almost gentle, her breath catching for a moment as she shivered and locked her legs around Rio.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I need you," she muttered.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You got me," Rio said, and kissed Agatha again, grinding the cock in deep as she felt herself softly drift into the melt of climax.

<p>
      "So tell me... William, why should I hire you?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Well, ma'am..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Oh, please, call me Mrs. Harkness-Vidal."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Well, Mrs. Harkness-Vidal, I love books. I absolutely love them. Also, I feel I could bring a great vibe to the shop."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "A vibe. I see. And are you aware, William, that shops don't all run on vibes?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You must admit, Mrs. Harkness-Vidal, that atmosphere can certainly attract a clientele."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "This is not a Hot Topic, William. It is a bookshop. We are here to provide people with knowledge, information, and entertainment, not a kicky lighting scheme and shirts featuring horror icons of yesteryear."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Looking down at the application, Agatha shook her head.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Still, I like the cut of your jib. You're hired."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Really? Oh, thank you, Mrs. Harkness-Vidal! Oh, you won't regret it!"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      The boy stood, all flustered, and shook Agatha's hand before turning and bolting out of the office, nearly colliding with Rio as he went. He nodded to her, then tore off out of the shop, clearly elated. Rio watched him go, chuckling.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "How are my new shelving units coming?" Agatha asked.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Pretty good," Rio said.
      <br/>
      "Logan and me just got two more to place. Aside from that, jeez, sweets, why were you being such a bitch to that kid?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I was simply running a solid job interview. Separating the wheat from the chaff."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Standing, Agatha walked around and pulled Rio all the way into the office, closing the door and locking it.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "The only person I'm a bitch with," she said, "is you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      As she said that, she pushed Rio back against the door, pressing their bodies as close as possible. Rio groaned, head tilting back.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Fuck, Agatha. We... Fuck..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "It's nearly lunchtime. Logan and Wade will knock off in a few minutes, and you can do what I know you're absolutely dying to do."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "What's that?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Fuck me on this huge 18th century rosewood desk you insisted on buying me that takes up nearly the whole office."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Shit. I did buy that desk with the express hope that I'd get to fuck you on it."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha frowned.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Wait, really?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "No, you dink. I bought it because I could tell you loved it."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Oh, Rio. You wonderful..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "If I get to fuck you on it, that's just a bonus."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Little shit."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "But I'm your little shit."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Yes you are."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio kissed Agatha with a passion that, frankly, Agatha felt had been sorely lacking in the last few months. There kept being periods of their life where they were extraordinarily busy, especially now with getting the businesses started and everything. When that happened, it seemed like their time for each other all but vanished.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      When the kiss finally broke, they were both panting and Agatha was clinging to Rio in an effort to stay upright. Outside, they heard the distinct chatter and clatter of the carpenters they had hired, Logan and Wade, heading out for lunch.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You wanna?" Rio said and nodded over toward the desk.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Sit in my chair," Agatha grinned.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      While Rio rushed to be seated, Agatha took her time putting away some papers that were left unfiled, moving a few small stacks of books out of her way, shoving aside a box of office supplies...
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Sweetheart," Rio groaned.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I'm on my way. Goodness, what, is my pretty, pretty boy starving? Is she absolutely famished?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio nodded, eyes wide, as Agatha moved to sit on the edge of the desk.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Well, she better dig into her lunch then."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Leaning back on her hands, Agatha spread her legs just enough for Rio to get a good peek up her skirt. When warm, rough hands slid lovingly up along her inner thighs, however, all sense of control went out the window. Agatha slumped back onto her elbows, hips jerking up helplessly in anticipation.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I've barely even touched you," Rio smirked, fingers grazing the crotch of Agatha's panties, "and you've soaked through. Fuck, I guess I've been neglecting my duties."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Rio, please..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Okay,
      <em>
       mi luz
      </em>
      . Breathe. Let's just get these off..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      There was a sense of pressure, and a distinct ripping sound, and Agatha knew that, for only the third time in their relationship, ease of access had won out over keeping her undergarments intact. She lifted her hips, more consciously this time, to allow Rio to pull away the shredded fabric.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I... Like how," Agatha gasped, "you're not concerned if I'll be going commando the rest of the day."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I'll run out and buy you underwear," Rio grumbled, tugging Agatha closer to the edge of the desk.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha's skirt had already been bunched high around her thighs, but now Rio shoved it up further. The chill air of the office hit Agatha's exposed ass, and she groaned.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "My love..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I gotcha. Fuck, do I gotcha."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      And then Rio's head was between her legs, Rio's nose nuzzling in to press against her clit as Rio's tongue teased among her folds.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Fuck, fuck, fuck," Agatha breathed.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      It was so hot, so good, Rio was doing everything just right, but Agatha had a sense that this one would take a while, maybe most of the hour...
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Until Rio plunged three fingers in, pumping and twisting them fast. Agatha whimpered, trying to fuck herself against the fingers as Rio began sucking hard on her clit.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Please, Rio, I... I'm gonna..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Cum for me, sweetheart. It's okay."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha felt all of the strength leave her body for a moment as her vision grayed out and she flopped back, head hanging off the far edge of the desk. She lay there, twitching, panting, whining, until she felt Rio move around and gently lift her, actually pick her up and carry her around, then sit back in the desk chair, holding her.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Okay,
      <em>
       mi luz
      </em>
      ? I didn't hurt you, did I? Okay, sweetheart. I gotcha. Just breathe with me, okay?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio's face glistened with Agatha's slick, and the front of her shirt was soaked as well.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "S-sorry..." Agatha whispered.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Don't be. This is why I always carry wet wipes and a change of clothes in the car. Just relax, my sweetheart. Just relax."

      They lay in bed, waiting for the timer to beep. Rio was spooned up against Agatha's back, one hand pressed gently to her wife's belly. Agatha's hand rested on Rio's, fingers nervously tapping.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "If it's positive..." Agatha murmured.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "If it's positive, it's positive," Rio said, "and... And if you've changed your mind about having..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I want this, Rio. I want our baby. But I just... After last time, I..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "
      <em>
       Mi luz
      </em>
      , everything can be fine this time. We had all that testing done, checked and rechecked, you're doing all the things the doctors recommended. This baby will be fine."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I want it to be. Oh, I want it to be."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio carefully hugged Agatha a little tighter, nuzzling into her hair.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You'll have our baby, Agatha, and you'll be an amazing mother. We are gonna love our child so much, and we'll give them everything. Our love, our time, our support. We're gonna knock this parenting thing out of the park, sweetheart. I swear."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      From the bathroom came the soft
      <em>
       dididi
      </em>
      of the timer. Rio sat up, but Agatha remained lying very still, but for a heavy sigh.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Want me to get it for you,
      <em>
       cariño
      </em>
      ?" Rio whispered.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Just... Just look and tell me? I can't even... I'm so afraid, Rio."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Leaning down, Rio kissed Agatha's cheek.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Relax. I'll go check it. No matter what, I'm here, okay? I'm here to take care of you."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Shuffling to the edge of the bed, Rio took a deep breath and stood, then made her way slowly to the bathroom.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      The test was lying on the edge of the sink, waiting. Rio's chest and throat felt constricted as she stepped closer, and she closed her eyes tight for a moment before she looked down. After staring at the test for an age, she nodded, turned, and went back to the bedroom.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Sweetheart," she said softly.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      She saw Agatha sit up in the dim early morning light.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Is it negative? Oh, God, it's negative, isn't it? I can't..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Agatha. Agatha,
      <em>
       mi luz, mi amor
      </em>
      , it's positive."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio went quickly and knelt by the bedside.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Agatha, you're gonna have our baby."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "It... I'm pregnant?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "According to the test. If you wanna take another one..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha scrambled out of the bed, a hand on Rio's shoulder for support, and headed toward the bathroom. Rio stood and followed her. By the time she reached the bathroom doorway, Agatha was standing at the sink, looking down at the test, one hand on her belly, one pressed to her mouth as if to cover shock.
     </p>
<p>
      "I'm pregnant," she whispered.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Are you... Do you want..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Rio, tell me it's going to be all right. Please, just say that."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "It's going to be all right, Agatha. This is going to be all right."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Drawing in a few deep, shuddery breaths, Agatha turned and moved to throw her arms around Rio's neck.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I believe you," she sobbed.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Do... Do you?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "I do. I believe it's going to be all right. This pregnancy, our child..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha, hugging her not too tightly, but with enough pressure to assure of love.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "It's gonna be all right. Everything. Everything's gonna be all right."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "This time, no problems," Agatha said.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Never. This time will be perfect."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Rio wanted to believe it. Time had passed, life had moved on, and now they would have the family they had been dreaming of. They would have the life they wanted.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Oh, I am gonna take such good care of you, Agatha."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You better. After all, you knocked me up, so it's your job to do all the caretaking around here for now. I'm gonna be pretty busy with other things."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Yeah, I know my responsibilities as dad of the house."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Agatha sniffled and laughed.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "You're gonna be such a dad. You already... You already love to slop around watching sports all weekend, and you tell lame jokes..."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "'Scuse me, but my jokes are never lame."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Rio, lightbulb jokes are the pinnacle of your comedic œuvre."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Pulling back slightly from their embrace, Rio shook her head and pressed a palm to Agatha's belly.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Hey, you in there, you gotta start gearin' up now. I'm gonna need someone on my side when your mama starts slingin' those expensive words around. The world needs more meatheads, son."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Rio Vidal, you are not a meathead. And our
      <u>
       daughter
      </u>
      won't be a meathead either."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Daughter, son, who cares, as long as they agree that dad-mom is always right."
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      Shaking her head, Agatha pulled Rio close again.
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Oh, you are gonna be trouble, aren't you?"
     </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
      "Madame, trouble is my middle name."
     </p>
</div>
