</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio Vidal had never minded a little physical labor. Growing up, she had always been the first of her siblings to volunteer for chores. She liked the structure that accompanied completing a task—it scratched something nice in her brain. She liked getting her hands dirty, seeing something broken or out of place, and giving it new potential. She liked the end result, feeling her body ache at the end of the day, and knowing she helped make the world even a little better.</p><p>Rio also had an affinity for the outdoors. Ever the green thumb, she was often found doing landscaping projects and tending to flowerbeds. It was no surprise when Rio decided to pursue a degree in botany; however, it was a very big surprise when four years (an incredible amount of debt) and one B.S. in Botany later, Rio had decided to become a garbage collector for the New Jersey Sanitation Department.</p><p>
<strong>Two Years Prior </strong>
</p><p>“Rio, are you sure this is what you want to do?” Rio’s mom had asked, eyeing her up and down.</p><p>“Yes, I promise. I just need to try something else—switch it up a bit,” Rio said, trying to convince her mom, and maybe herself a little too.</p><p>“And this has nothing to do with what’s her name?” Rio’s mom side-eyed her.</p><p>Rio gave her an eye roll in return, but to be fair, it did have a little to do with “what’s her name.” Rio had been considering pursuing grad school, partially because she wanted to, partially because she had no idea what she wanted to do with her life, and partially for “what’s her name.”</p><p>“What’s her name” was also studying botany, and had been Rio’s long-term situationship. Certified lover girl, Rio, had always hoped it would turn into more, but got a quick reality check when she caught “what’s her name” hooking up with her lab partner. And while that hurt, it gave Rio the needed push to pursue other life experiences and opportunities, hence the garbage collector job.</p><p>
<strong>Present Day</strong>
</p><p>Two years into the job and Rio had never felt more content with her life. She loved her job. She loved her coworkers. Her supervisor, Lilia Calderu, was the perfect mix of wise and kooky. Lilia had been with the sanitation department for nearly 40 years and helped pave the way for other women like Rio who were drawn to blue-collar jobs. She has seen some shit (literally), and could give it right back. Truly a survival tactic for this job.</p><p>And of course, it was love at first sight for Rio and her route buddy, Alice Wu-Gulliver. Rio had introvert tendencies, never one for small talk, so being trapped in a truck with a stranger for multiple hours a day sounded like her personal hell.</p><p>
<em>On Rio’s first day, Lilia sent her out to meet Alice, who was already in her truck. Rio squinted as she approached the truck, making out a bumper sticker that read, “Gas, Ass, or Grass Nobody Rides for Free.” </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio chuckled to herself, “Nice.” </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio could hear muffled music she identified as Beck’s “Loser” as she walked up to the driver’s side of the rig.</em>
</p><p>
<em> “SOYYYY UN PERDEDOR, I’M A LOSER BABY!” Alice passionately belted. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio tapped the side of the truck, cleared her throat, and Alice nearly jumped out of her skin. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Jesus! Warn a guy next time,” Alice yelled, clutching her chest. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Far be it from me to interrupt the songbird of our generation,” Rio smirked. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“A smartass! I like it. Get in,” Alice waved Rio into the truck. </em>
</p><p>So yeah, at 28 years old, Rio felt good with her life. She was happy, healthy, had good friends and family, and no major traumas. A smattering of trust issues. Oh, and an affinity for older brunette women who boss her around, but hey, who didn’t, so sue her.</p><p>Rio enjoyed all of her routes, but Tuesday mornings were her favorite because they collected in Westview, where she lived. She liked being up before everyone else—moving around her neighborhood before most people even thought about starting their day.</p><p>“Okay, light pole, building fence, into the truck,” Alice said, getting ready to chuck a scrunched-up soda can.</p><p>“Bet,” Rio said.</p><p>The can left Alice’s hand, struck the light pole, and ricocheted right back at her and Rio, who were diving out of the path of the can. A deep sigh caused both women to turn around and see Lilia, who had been observing their shenanigans.</p><p>“Westview’s Finest,” Rio said. Both she and Alice now giving Lilia a mock salute.</p><p>“Westview’s Finest, aye? All I see are two dipshits who are going to be behind schedule if they don’t get on the road now,” said a deeply unamused Lilia.</p><p>“Yes, ma’am,” Rio said with a smirk.</p><p>Westview was a pretty easy route. Everyone usually had their trash out on time, and there were rarely any large pickup requests.</p><p>“Hey, did you see we had a new address added to the route?” Alice asked Rio.</p><p>“Oh yeah, I did see some moving trucks at the house across from Herb. That place has been empty for a while. Fingers crossed it’s some hot, single mom. It’s hard work being the only eye candy around here,” Rio said to Alice, giving her a fake pout.</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes and checked the address, “It says Harkness. Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>“Agatha? Okay, so hot, single grandma maybe?” Rio shrugged.</p><p>As they pulled into Westview, everything looked normal. Most of her neighbor’s windows were still dark except for the fitness freaks and finance bros who had to check the stocks and whatever the fuck. Absolute psychopaths.</p><p>Rio jumped onto the back of the truck and loaded the cans as Alice drove. She glanced down at what would now be the Harkness and noticed that her lights were on as well. Rio wondered if she was a fitness freak, finance bro, or a secret third thing.</p><p>“Westview’s Finest” were ahead of schedule so far this morning. That was until they pulled up outside of the Davis residence. Rio enjoyed Sharon and her chipper personality quite a bit and was no stranger to helping her with various tasks around the house. No sooner than Alice had put the truck in park, Sharon shot out of the house yelling for Rio.</p><p>“Rio dear, I know I didn’t put in a request, but is there any way you could help me get rid of this dresser?” Sharon asked.</p><p>Rio knew it would put them a little behind schedule, but she didn’t mind.</p><p>“Of course, Mrs. Davis,” Rio smiled and walked up the sidewalk to retrieve the dresser.</p><p>Rio was strong. She was proud of her body, her muscles. She wasn’t necessarily a fitness fanatic, but her job and hobbies required her to be in shape. She made light work of the dresser, bending to pick it up and carry it back to the truck. Rio quickly glanced over at the Harkness residence and thought she saw a figure move behind the front window.</p><p>A few houses, some neighborly waves, and roughly 10 minutes behind schedule later, Alice and Rio were in front of Agatha’s house. The house, which had sat vacant for a bit, was in need of a fix-up. Rio was glad someone was finally there to give it some love.</p><p>There was one trash can and one recycling bin at the end of the driveway. Rio loved a recycler. As she got closer, Rio noticed a yellow Post-It note attached to the trash can. Odd, Rio thought to herself. Rio picked up the note, and in very elegant handwriting it read, “If you stopped socializing so much, maybe you could stay on schedule.” -A.H.</p><p>So, the secret third thing was a bitch, Rio thought to herself. An environmentally friendly bitch, but a bitch nonetheless.</p><p>Rio scoffed and showed Alice the note.</p><p>“Who does she think she is?” Rio said, gesturing wildly. “Just got here and already acting like she owns the damn place!”</p><p>Alice looked around Rio, “Hot too,” Alice muttered.</p><p>Rio looked confused before turning around and glancing back at the house where Agatha had appeared in the window. A white fitted t-shirt was tucked into her high-waisted jeans. Her brown hair was wild, like she hadn’t even had a chance to run a brush through it before writing her lovely little hate note.</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms and gripped a mug of coffee as she continued her stare down with Rio, and Rio could swear she saw her lips quirk into a smirk.</p><p>Rio groaned. Environmentally friendly, bitchy, and hot. Extremely hot.</p><p>Well, game on, Rio thought to herself.</p>

<p>Rio liked to think that she was a well-adjusted adult. Her temper was even-keeled, she was easy going, and pretty conflict-avoidant. A really go-with-the-flow kind of guy, if you will. But damn if this Harkness woman hadn’t dug her nails, which Rio guaranteed were perfectly manicured, into her skin.</p><p>It was embarrassing to admit, but Rio had spent the majority of her week and into the weekend thinking about how to get back at Agatha.</p><p>She could have her address removed from the route. No, Lilia would catch onto that too fast.</p><p>She could have her account marked delinquent. No, that would just be a billing department nightmare.</p><p>Rio let out a deep sigh, and then a wicked grin spread across her face. Reminiscent of when the Grinch came up with the idea to steal Christmas from the Whos in Whoville.</p><p>It was the perfect plan. She would start the Westview route early on Tuesday. Agatha wouldn’t have time to get her trash cans down to the end of her driveway, Rio could skip her house, and Agatha could deal with a trash backup for a week.</p><p>“How’s that for staying on schedule?” Rio murmured to absolutely no one but herself. Which was fine. She was fine. Totally sane and normal thing to do.</p><p>She grinned, thinking about how Agatha would probably put her hands on her gorgeously full hips. She would probably scrunch her nose and her brows would furrow and maybe she’d let out a frustrated sigh, and… Jesus! Head in the game, Vidal.</p><p>Tuesday morning couldn’t come fast enough for Rio. She shot out of bed, grabbed two coffees for her and Alice, and made it into work an hour ahead of time.</p><p>“Morning!” Rio yelled, too chipper not to be suspicious. She shoved the cup of coffee into Alice’s hand.</p><p>Alice frowned. “I’ve known you for two years, and never once have you been a morning person, early, or really even on time, for that matter. What gives?”</p><p>“Ya know, just like a beautiful day to save lives or whatever.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes. “This isn’t Seattle fuckin’ Grace. We pick up trash. What’s going on?”</p><p>“It’s actually Grey Sloan Memorial now. There was a merger. And you would know that if you caught up.”</p><p>Alice continued to look at her with dead eyes.</p><p>“Fine!” Rio exhaled. “I finally found a way to fuck with Harkness, but we have to leave now. “</p><p>Alice looked at her with mock sympathy. “Aw, buddy. Have you really been thinking about this all week?”</p><p>“Yeah, I don’t really have too much going on at the moment,” Rio shrugged.</p><p>Alice, ever a girl’s girl, gave in. “I’m in, but if Lilia finds out it’s your ass.”</p><p>Rio rubbed her hands together like a devious raccoon, and they were off!</p><p>Everything was going according to Rio’s plan. They were still ahead of schedule, and it seemed like Agatha was the only person in their subdivision who didn’t put her trash cans out the night before. Perfect.</p><p>When they were two houses away, Rio started to get a little antsy. Were they making too much noise? What if Agatha heard them and brought the cans down in the nick of time?</p><p>They loaded up Herb’s trash and were about to pull across the street to Agatha’s house when her lights turned on.</p><p>“Fuck! Alice, we gotta go fast!” A panicky Rio shouted, noticing Agatha’s front door start to open.</p><p>The truck roared to life and swiftly moved past Agatha’s driveway just as a very irate-looking brunette flew out the door and down the sidewalk. Oh, and in just a robe apparently. Rio could get behind this exhibitionist behavior.</p><p>“Hey! You forgot my stop!” Agatha roared, making a frantic grab for her trash cans.</p><p>Rio, who was conveniently hanging off the back of the truck, was now at Agatha’s neighbors' house pretending not to hear her.</p><p>“Trash lady! Are you dumb, bad at your job, or both?” Agatha shouted. Her cheeks were flushed and her nose absolutely did that cute little scrunched “I’m pissed off thing.” Rio loved it.</p><p>She very nonchalantly turned around, giving Alice a quick look. “Oh, it’s Karen Harkness, right?” Alice was dying in the driver’s seat.</p><p>“Agatha. Harkness.” Agatha all but growled back.</p><p>This was delighting Rio to no end.</p><p>“Right, of course.” Rio played along. “I know you’re new here, but maybe if you managed your time a little wiser, you could have stayed on schedule and brought your cans down in a timely manner. You seem like someone who enjoys staying on schedule, if I remember correctly.”</p><p>And now Agatha was absolutely fuming. And Rio was afraid. And turned on? But mostly afraid.</p><p>Agatha gripped her robe around her tightly and flipped her hair back. “You fucking entitled, fucking pretentious little fucking dipshit.”</p><p>Rio looked over at Alice, and they both made that face you make when your mom is yelling at you, but it’s funny.</p><p>“Back the truck up and pick up my trash. It’s not my fault you can’t take a little constructive criticism,” Agatha huffed.</p><p>Rio clasped her hands together like she had tried everything. “No can do, Kar… I mean Agatha. I guess we’ll just have to see you next week.”</p><p>Alice mouthed a very exaggerated “sorry” to Agatha as they sped away.</p><p>Unfortunately for them, Agatha was about ten steps ahead as per usual.</p><p>Alice and Rio finished their route. They were still laughing and high-fiving as they pulled back into the sanitation plant.</p><p>“Did you see her face?” Rio was almost in tears, she was laughing so hard.</p><p>“If looks could kill, man.”</p><p>Their victory was, however, short-lived. Alice parked the truck, and she and Rio were met with a very stern-looking Lilia who had her arms crossed, standing in the doorway of the plant.</p><p>“Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, my office now,” Lilia boomed.</p><p>“Wait, who do you think is dee and who is dumb?” Rio questioned.</p><p>“You’re definitely fuckin’ dumb, dude,” Alice said as they followed in lockstep behind Lilia.</p><p>The bickering continued as they reached Lilia’s office.</p><p>“Jesus Christ, it's Dee and Dum, not d-u-m-b. And you’re both idiots. Sit down.” Lilia gestured toward two seats in front of her desk.</p><p>“Would either of you like to explain why I just got off the phone with a new customer who claims you refused to pick up her trash, referred to her as a 'Karen,' and called her dog ugly?” Lilia asked.</p><p>“Oh, that’s such bullshit! She doesn’t even have a dog!” Rio piped up.</p><p>“That’s what you’re getting from this?” Lilia looked beyond annoyed. Maybe a little amused. They kept her young.</p><p>Rio and Alice looked back at Lilia. A little ashamed, a little not.</p><p>“Right. So, Rio, since I’m guessing you were the brains behind this operation, you’ll be making a special trip back to the Harkness residence this evening for a pickup,” Lilia said.</p><p>Rio groaned. “She started it, Lilia!”</p><p>Lilia waved her hand dismissively. “Oh, and I also wanted to mention she’s a lawyer. So whatever little game this is, I suggest you play it wisely.”</p><p>Alice walked Rio back out to the truck.</p><p>“Well, it has been an honor serving with you, buddy.” Alice pretended to play a violin and played “Nearer My God To Thee” on her phone.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “I’ll see you in the morning, dude.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t normally one to get nervous, but she’d be lying if she said her palms weren’t getting sweaty the closer she got to Westview.</p><p>Maybe it will be a quick trip, Rio thought to herself. They both got their digs in today. She’ll do the pickup. Agatha will probably be inside her house. One and done.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>As Rio approached the Harkness residence, she noticed that two things were off. One, the trash cans were flipped upside down without lids-- how nice of her. And two, that gorgeous, nightmare woman was sitting at the end of the driveway in a lawn chair, with a glass of wine in hand. She was in a pair of striped cotton shorts, a tank top, and no bra? Rio would be sure to do some thorough research into that. She was nothing if not studious.</p><p>Rio parked the truck and hopped out.</p><p>“Look, Mrs. Harkness..” Rio was interrupted.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness,” Agatha interjected.</p><p>Duly noted.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness. I think we both got our jabs out of the way this morning. And we’ve both had long days. So let’s just make this a pleasant exchange, and I’ll be on my way.”</p><p>“My days are as long as they need to be, Ms. Vidal,” Agatha quipped.</p><p>“Cool, so we both know things about each other.”</p><p>Rio tried to maneuver the trash can onto its side so that not all of the contents would spill out. Once again, no such luck. As Rio began scooping up the trash, she noticed that a smirk had returned to Agatha’s lips.</p><p>Well, two could play that game.</p><p>Rio began to pilfer through the contents of Agatha’s trash. Noting several wine bottles.</p><p>“Looks like you like to have some fun. Host a party or was this damage all you?” Rio gestured to the empty bottles.</p><p>“I don’t see how that’s any of your business,” Agatha replied hotly.</p><p>“Well, lawyer lady, I thought you would know this, but when your trash is put out onto the curb, it becomes public property. You can get a pretty good idea of who a person is through their trash,” Rio said as she continued to dig.</p><p>“Cut it out, you creep!”</p><p>“Well, well, well, L’Oreal Paris Root Rescue? Those greys coming in quick, Agatha?” Rio snickered.</p><p>A flush started to bloom across Agatha’s chest. No bra confirmed.</p><p>“You little shit!” Agatha made a move toward Rio, who quickly blocked her with one arm.</p><p>“Is that prescription-strength deodorant I see?”</p><p>“It’s extra strength,” Agatha growled.</p><p>“And the world thanks you for that,” Rio muttered.</p><p>“Didn’t they teach you to read in trash school?”</p><p>Of course, the white-collar lady would make that kind of dig. Joke's on her, there is no trash school.</p><p>Rio continued to dig while holding Agatha back with one arm.</p><p>“Oh, and what’s this? Dino-shaped chicken nuggets?” Rio looked at her with eyes full of amusement.</p><p>“So sue me for having a little fun with my meals!” Agatha slapped the box from her hands.</p><p>Feeling like she had made her point, Rio scraped the rest of the trash back into the can and loaded it on the truck. An irate Agatha stood in the driveway, glaring back at her.</p><p>“Well, this has just been an illuminating experience, Ms. Harkness,” Rio said as she hopped back into the truck.</p><p>“Same time next Tuesday?” Rio asked.</p><p>She received another one of Agatha’s patented death stares. A scowl that could genuinely melt the flesh off her face, but filled Rio with absolute joy.</p><p>“Perfect. It’s a date,” Rio offered her a smug smile and drove away.</p><p>Harkness 1 Rio 1</p>

<strong>Agatha </strong>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t back down from a challenge. Being a lawyer was second nature to her. She loved a good verbal spar—a battle of wits. That was why this petty war with the neighborhood trash lady was just a little fuckin’ annoying.</p><p>She had debated some of the brightest legal minds to date and came out on top. She had gone toe to toe with and defeated some of the greatest threats to society—straight, white men in suits. And yet here she was, bested by some Doc Marten wearing, electric car driving, volunteer at the local humane society shelter on the weekend ass millennial garbage collector.</p><p>Yes, Agatha had been doing her research. And yes, the fact that Rio was a good person made the situation even more infuriating.</p><p>“Probably donates to fuckin’ NPR, which is great,” Agatha grumbled, staring out her window toward Rio’s house.</p><p>Agatha had moved to Westview for a fresh start. She needed to get out of the city. Commuting to New York for work every so often gave her the fix she craved for the hustle of city life. She wanted calm. She wanted quiet. This was a new chapter for her.</p><p>And look, Agatha wasn’t looking to immediately make an enemy; she just had high expectations of the New Jersey Sanitation Department. She wanted to get along with her neighbors, or at least for them to leave her alone. Either way.</p><p>Which, speaking of, she needed to remember to thank Mrs. Hart for the welcome to the neighborhood zucchini bread she was currently munching on. That was her name, right? Or was it Mrs. Dav—nope, it was definitely Mrs. Hart.</p><p>Anyway. Back to the task at hand. Tomorrow was trash day, and Agatha was cooking up a plan. And speaking of her plan, it looked like her target was just getting home from work.</p><p>Rio had already changed out of her work clothes, sporting some light-washed, high-waisted distressed jeans, a cropped black t-shirt that rode up just enough to expose her abs, not that Agatha was looking, a carabiner holding her keys that she had just clipped to her belt loop, and some Sambas.</p><p>“Woman’s a walking pride flag,” Agatha grumbled.</p><p>And ugh, honestly, how dare this woman be a good person, a worthy rival, and hot. That was three strikes in Agatha’s book.</p><p>Mrs. Dav—Mrs. Hart saw Rio exit her car and called her over to help her move some bags of soil. Agatha watched Rio’s muscles flex as she moved the heavy bags of dirt. She watched how her sleeves clung to her biceps. Her shirt stretched tight across her back. Sweat started to bead on her forehead and drip down her neck. And this was all for science, by the way.</p><p>The way Rio had said “it’s a date” kept floating around in Agatha’s head.</p><p>Well, it might not be a date, but Rio would never forget it, Agatha thought smugly to herself.</p><p>Unfortunately for Rio, Agatha was also stupid hot. Like ruin your life, cause climate change, shift tectonic plates levels of hotness. And even worse—she knew it. She used it as a weapon. She could have the entire gender spectrum melting into a puddle at her feet. And poor Rio had already made the rookie mistake of checking her out last week.</p><p>Agatha laughed to herself, remembering Rio’s face buffering in real life when she realized Agatha had gone braless under her tank top.</p><p>This was going to be fun.</p><p>
<strong>Rio</strong>
</p><p>As Alice pulled into Westview on Tuesday morning, Rio anticipated an easy morning. Aside from an ongoing and very mature middle finger war, things between her and Agatha were going great.</p><p>“Planning on TP-ing your girl’s house or something this morning?” Alice asked as they pulled up outside Agatha’s.</p><p>“She’s not my—what do you, shut up, man,” Rio blushed and stuttered. “She’d probably figure out a legal loophole and have me on a do-not-fly list within ten minutes just for fun.”</p><p>Hopping off the back truck, Rio glanced up at Agatha’s house and noticed her staring out the window. She was already done up in her hot lady lawyer attire—a black turtle neck, fitted blazer, slacks, and what Rio could only imagine were some killer heels.</p><p>Thankfully, it looked like she had managed to at least brush her hair this morning. The brown waves were thrown over her shoulder, highlighting her defined jawline. Rio found her mind drifting, wondering what it would feel like to run her fingers through it.  </p><p>God, she was annoying. Rio offered her a little wave. Not necessarily to be friendly, but more to be spiteful.</p><p>Agatha gave her the finger in return, which genuinely made Rio laugh.</p><p>“This bitch,” Rio muttered. The woman never quit. And Rio respected the hustle.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and flipped open the lid on Agatha’s trash cans. She began to very animatedly rummage through Agatha’s trash again, hoping to get a rise out of her. However, Agatha had predicted this.</p><p>Rio grabbed a small cardboard box that was sitting at the top of the trash, proudly holding it up before taking a quick glance at the contents.</p><p>“6.5 inches, a sweet spot targeting curve, ten vibration modes, and (drumroll please) lavender.”</p><p>Rio had picked up Agatha’s discarded strap box.</p><p>She dropped the box back into the can like it burned her, her mouth slightly ajar, skin flushing a deep red. A brief look at Agatha, who was laughing so hard Rio doubted she could breathe, confirmed she had carefully coordinated this little stunt.</p><p>Rio quickly loaded the trash and hopped back in the truck, careful to avoid any eye contact with Alice.</p><p>“Ready to go?” Alice asked.</p><p>“Yep, let’s do it,” Rio said hurriedly, still trying to get her pulse back to normal.</p><p>“You good? You’re acting a little funny.”</p><p>“No, yeah, I’m good. Just a little tired.” Rio faked a yawn and a stretch. “Tuesdays amirite?”</p><p>“Alright, weirdo,” Alice said, driving off.</p><p>Now, Rio wasn’t a prude, far from it, actually. And honestly, she tried to shake the morning from her mind and forget about it. But damn if she didn’t have a big case of Agatha Harkness’s strap on the brain.</p><p>Lunch break. <em>“6.5 inches, good for her.”</em></p><p>Shift change. <em>“Ten different vibration modes? That’s a lot of options.”</em></p><p>Drive home. <em>“Lavender? Lol gayyyyy.”</em></p><p>Rio’s train of thought was broken when she pulled into her driveway and saw the strap owner herself stretched across her front steps like she owned the place.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>“Okay, this is harassment.” A flustered Rio got out of her car. “How do you even know where I live?”</p><p>“Oh, you mean apart from me having eyeballs and you living three houses down from me?” Agatha stated very matter-of-factly.</p><p>That was a fantastic point.</p><p>“Let’s see, you’re the only one in the neighborhood with an electric car littered with subpar '90s band and bad weed joke bumper stickers,” Agatha said.</p><p>Rio gasped, feigning offense. The ‘90s were making a comeback, and more people needed to get on board. And she loved her bumper sticker with the high cow that said “420 Graze It.” Made her laugh every time.</p><p>“You’re also the only one on the block with a greenhouse almost as big as your actual house,” Agatha continued.</p><p>“Okay, detective.” Rio huffed. “Any reason you’ve decided to grace me with your presence?” Rio continued to walk toward her house. Agatha remained sitting on the steps, staring up at Rio.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth and then shut it. Rio could see the gears turning in her head.</p><p>“I just thought I would tell you that you look very strapping today, Rio.” Rio blushed, and Agatha gave her a wicked smile.</p><p>“No, but really, I do have a favor to ask you,” Agatha followed up.</p><p>“You think you’re in a position to be asking favors of me?” Rio asked, still struggling to make eye contact with Agatha.</p><p>Agatha paused for a beat. “I think I could put myself in any position I wanted, and you would say yes, Rio.” She leaned forward, pretending to pick invisible lint from Rio’s shirt.</p><p>And damn, yeah, she was right, but Agatha didn’t need to know that.</p><p>Agatha stood. “I’m going into the city for a few days. I won’t be here for the next pickup day, and seeing as you know me rather intimately now, I was wondering if you could take my trash out.”</p><p>This woman with the rapid-fire jabs.</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure what she had expected Agatha to ask, but it wasn’t that. “Um, sure. Yeah, I can do that.”</p><p>“Great, I’ll see you in a week.” Agatha began walking back down Rio’s driveway. “And don’t do any weird shit with my trash.”</p><p>“You look really pretty,” Rio muttered under her breath.</p><p>“What was that?” Agatha paused.</p><p>Uh, oh.</p><p>“I said you look shitty! Goodnight, Agatha.” Rio darted inside.</p><p>Smooth as hell.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>It was pathetic. She was pathetic—the she being Rio.</p><p>Agatha was living absolutely rent-free in Rio’s brain. She hadn’t even been out of town a full week, but Rio found herself almost missing her. Missing the nuisance with whom she had traded more petty insults than had actual conversations with. What was wrong with her?</p><p>Maybe she would opt for that MRI. She had decent insurance. And she was getting closer and closer to 30 every day, so it was about time for every warning light in her body to click on.</p><p>Rio slumped in the break room seat and lay her head on the table.</p><p>“Oof, did they cancel <em>Game of Thrones</em>?” Alice asked, plopping down next to Rio.</p><p>Rio glanced up at Alice through the crook of her arm, “That show literally ended six years ago. And they would never cancel <em>Game of Thrones</em>. It was a crossover hit. It’s not just for fantasy enthusiasts; they’re telling human stories in a fantasy world!”</p><p>“Okay, so they out of ceremonial grade matcha at the hipster store?” she asked, nudging Rio in the ribs, which only earned her a glare.</p><p>“Really, what’s wrong?” Alice asked.</p><p>“Ican’tstopthinkingaboutAgatha,” Rio mumbled into her arm, head still on the table.</p><p>“You wanna try that again?”</p><p>“I can’t stop thinking about Agatha,” Rio said clearly this time, sitting up in her seat.</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes. “Dude, just ask her out.”</p><p>“Oh right, let me just ask out the crazy hot, six-figure making, Ivy League graduate, supermodel lawyer out on a date,” Rio said sarcastically. “She probably has a roster of tens on her lineup. I’m like fuckin’ Danny DeVito next to her.”</p><p>Alice gasped. “Hey, now. Not too much on my boy Danny. That is America’s sweetheart.”</p><p>“You’re right,” Rio conceded. “Bad comparison. I just got worked up.”</p><p>Now, Rio had a very healthy self-image. She knew she was attractive, kind, emotionally intelligent, attentive to her partner’s needs, a good listener, well-adjusted, funny, incredible in bed—she was a catch. But Agatha intimidated the hell out of her.</p><p>“Look, I’m going to pay you your one yearly compliment now, Rio,” Alice said, looking at her genuinely. “You’re one of the best and kindest people I know. You deserve good things. You deserve to be happy. And Agatha would be so lucky to have a chance with you.”</p><p>Before things got too sentimental, Alice hopped out of her seat, dragging Rio over to the break room sink, forcing her to look into the mirror above it.</p><p>“Look at this fine bitch!” Alice shouted, grabbing Rio’s face. “Are you looking!?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said quietly.</p><p>“She’s hot, she’s funny, and she deserves good things!” Alice shouted. “Now say it.”</p><p>“I’m hot, I’m funny, and I deserve good things,” Rio said in a conversational volume.</p><p>“Louder!”</p><p>“I’m hot, I’m funny, and I deserve good things!” Rio shouted this time.</p><p>Alice grabbed Rio’s face, forcing it closer to the mirror. “I’m going to ask out the hot, older lawyer lady, and she would be lucky to have me! Say it!”</p><p>“I’m going to ask out the hot, older lawyer lady, and she would be lucky to have me!” Rio shouted. “Because I’m a fuckin’ catch!”</p><p>“Damn right you are!”</p><p>The two continued their very animated pep talk—whooping, yelling, smacking each other on the ass. Very reminiscent of a high school locker room at halftime.</p><p>Alice jumped behind Rio, “Quick! Trust fall.”</p><p>Rio lined up and began her fall backward, when a sigh caused Alice to whip around leaving Rio to fall flat on her ass.</p><p>“You two, always at the scene of the doing dumb shit crime,” Lilia said.</p><p>“Rio is going to ask the hot, scary lawyer lady on a date,” Alice said proudly.</p><p>Lilia looked down at Rio, who was still sprawled on the floor, wagging her eyebrows at Lilia.</p><p>Lilia just smiled. “Mazel tov. Now, would either of you like to do your jobs today?”</p><p>“Absolutely, Lilia. I would love nothing more,” Alice said as the two scrambled out of the break room.</p><p>Rio was feeling pretty good when she got home that evening. Her talk with Alice really did give her a confidence boost.</p><p>But a glance at Agatha’s still empty driveway immediately invited back those gnawing feelings of doubt, nervousness, and oh, jealousy?</p><p>Rio’s rational brain knew she had nothing to be jealous about. Agatha wasn’t hers. She was a grown ass woman who could do whatever she wanted.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t even told Rio why she was going out of town. Rio assumed it was a work thing—hoped it was a work thing. But she could be visiting friends and family. Or, and the thought made Rio slightly panicky, she could be on a date.</p><p>She tried to wipe the unwelcome thought from her mind, but it plagued her as the evening went on.</p><p>As Rio was cooking dinner for herself, she pictured Agatha across the table from someone at some overpriced, bullshit Michelin star restaurant. They were making her laugh, and god, her smile was gorgeous. Maybe they would reach across the table and hold her hand, slowly stroking their thumb across the back of Agatha's. Rio was no longer hungry.</p><p>In the shower, Rio imagined Agatha’s fictitious date had gone well. Maybe they would kiss in the elevator of whatever fancy hotel Agatha was staying at. Maybe Agatha would invite her date inside. Still worked up from their kiss in the elevator, maybe she’d push their back against the door, pressing heated kisses up their neck, along their jaw, until she reached their lips.</p><p>Rio felt her stomach burn at the thought—<em> “Jesus, am I ovulating?” </em></p><p>The unwelcome thoughts persisted as she tossed back and forth in bed, trying to sleep. A quick glance at her phone told her it was 2 a.m., and while she should be focusing on getting some sleep before her shift started in two hours—all she could think about was fucking Agatha. Literally.</p><p>She thought about how Agatha’s skin would taste underneath her tongue. How pretty her sighs would sound as they slipped past her lips.</p><p>Lying on her stomach, Rio felt her hips start to grind into her mattress, begging for some kind of friction. Her fingers clutching at her sheets. <em>God, was she really doing this?</em></p><p>She thought about how warm and responsive Agatha’s body would feel under her. How Agatha’s hips would cant upwards when Rio touched her—her mouth parting and brows furrowing as she moaned.</p><p>Rio felt herself start to grind harder, but god, it wasn’t enough. She flipped over onto her back. One hand moving up to grab at her breast, and the other dragging her nails down her abs, stopping as she reached the top of her boxers.</p><p>Rio began to stroke herself over the top of her boxers, working herself up. When she felt like she might explode, she slipped her hand underneath, letting her fingers glide through neatly trimmed curls before reaching the copious amount of wetness created by her fantasies of Agatha.</p><p>She paused. <em>Was this wrong?</em></p><p>Whatever. She’d deal with it later. Post nut clarity, as the kids say.</p><p>Rio dragged a finger from her entrance up to her clit before beginning to make tight, frenzied circles. Her hips immediately bucked. She wasn’t going to last long. Her body felt like a live wire.</p><p>Her mind drifted back to Agatha, and she felt her orgasm begin to build low in her stomach.</p><p>
<em>Thunk!</em>
</p><p>Her fingers moved faster, and she felt her abs start to flex. She imagined how good Agatha would feel around her fingers. How her hips would move in time with Rio’s thrusts, taking her as deep as possible.</p><p>
<em>Thunk! What the fuck was that?</em>
</p><p>Rio was almost there. Her body started to seize up, nipples straining painfully hard against her t-shirt.</p><p>
<em>Thunk!</em>
</p><p>FUCK! Rio ripped her hand out of her boxers and shot out of bed. Her orgasm denied brain began to search her room for a weapon so she could find out where that noise was coming from.</p><p>
<em>Thunk!</em>
</p><p>Rio grabbed the closest thing to a weapon she had in her house—a lightsaber she had made at Galaxy’s Edge on a trip to Disney. And Rio wasn’t even a Star Wars head, but when in Rome.</p><p>Rio looked out the window and saw a figure moving on her front lawn. <em>What the hell?</em></p><p>She slowly crept down her stairs, clad in only some Bart Simpson boxers, a t-shirt, and some socks. Rio wasn’t a fighter, so she handled the situation in the best way she knew how.</p><p>Flinging open her front door and rushing onto the porch, “I have a gun!” She shouted.</p><p>She unintentionally hit the button on the lightsaber, causing it to light up and make an obnoxious clanging noise.</p><p>“No, you have a lightsaber, Obi-Wan.”</p><p>Rio paused. She knew that voice.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio asked, squinting out into the darkness.</p><p>“Miss me?”</p><p>Rio couldn’t see, but she could guarantee Agatha was flashing her that thousand-watt smile. Seeing no imminent threat, Rio made her way down the steps toward Agatha.</p><p>“I thought you wouldn’t be back until tomorrow?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, “I finished up work early and decided to head home.”</p><p>Work. It was a work thing. Rio secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>As Rio got closer, she could see Agatha was sporting some sneakers, tattered sweatpants, and an old Columbia Law crewneck. Her hair was swept into a messy nest on the top of her head, and she had on some, oh, glasses. That better not awaken anything in Rio. It would.</p><p>“Any reason you’re on my lawn at 3 a.m., or did you pick up a trespassing hobby?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Just doing some late-night bathroom renovations and thought I would make your job a little easier,” Agatha said, gesturing down to a toilet that sat at her feet.</p><p>It finally clicked for Rio. The loud thunking. This absolute psycho had carried a toilet three houses down just to leave it on her lawn. God, Rio liked her so much.</p><p>“Would it not have been easier to just wait and let me pick it up in the morning? And bathroom renovations? Do you even know what you’re doing?”</p><p>Agatha launched into a long rant about how she resented that implication, a long list of grievances about the company she had hired to do the replacements, and her plans for the downstairs bathroom. And Rio stood there in her Simpsons boxers and socks, freezing her ass, just happy to be hearing Agatha’s voice.</p><p>She genuinely thought she could listen to Agatha talk about anything. But Rio felt a question threatening to escape her lips. It felt like word vomit when it finally slipped out.</p><p>“Go on a date with me?” It tumbled out of her mouth before Rio could stop it. <em>Fuck dude, not like this. </em></p><p>Agatha paused mid-sentence, eyes assessing Rio. And Rio braced for the rejection.</p><p>“Yeah, sure.”</p><p>Wait.</p><p>“Really?” Rio asked, a little taken aback.</p><p>“Yeah, it was getting a little boring around here anyway.”</p><p>Rio’s sleep-deprived brain was still trying to process her obvious win.</p><p>“So, can I have your number?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Sure, do you have your phone?”</p><p>Looking down, Rio realized the only thing she had on her person was that stupid lightsaber she was still clutching.</p><p>“Give me two seconds.”</p><p>Rio took off toward the house, practically tripping over her own feet. She knew she wouldn’t have time to scour her room for wherever she tossed her phone, so she grabbed a Sharpie and ran back outside.</p><p>Agatha was still standing in the middle of Rio’s lawn, arms crossed.</p><p>“Them digits please,” a breathless Rio said. A stupid smile on her face as she presented her forearm and the marker to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha gave her an “Are you serious?” look, and seeing no indication that Rio was joking, she wrote her phone number on Rio’s arm.</p><p>“Alright, well, have fun at work in an hour,” Agatha said as she capped the marker. “And have fun with the toilet. Terribly out of date. Can’t believe the previous owners lived that way.”</p><p>As Rio watched Agatha walk away, she fought the urge to whip out the <em>Breakfast Club</em> fist pump. She wasn’t totally convinced that this wasn’t all a dream. That would explain the toilet that still sat in the middle of her lawn. Eh, she would deal with it in the morning.</p><p>Alice found Rio asleep in the driver’s seat of her car at the sanitation plant the next morning.</p><p>Alice knocked on the car window. “Hey buddy, you good?”</p><p>Rio shot awake. And wouldn’t you know it, that stupid grin was still on her face.</p><p>She presented her arm with the phone number. “I don’t know, you tell me.” Rio wagged her eyebrows up and down.</p><p>Alice looked concerned. “Yeah, I don’t know. All I see is a sleep-deprived weirdo, with a ten-digit code on her arm, and a toilet in her passenger seat.”</p><p>“She said yes to the date, Al.”</p><p>Alice smiled down at Rio. “And does the toilet have anything to do with this date?”</p><p>“Actually, yes, it’s a funny story.”</p><p> </p>

<p>“So, have you talked to her yet?” Alice asked.</p><p>“It’s been like a day,” Rio mumbled around a mouthful of breakfast burrito.</p><p>“I can’t let her think I’m desperate. I’m very classy.” Half of the contents of the breakfast burrito spilled into her lap.</p><p>Alice laughed, handing her a napkin. “Yeah, here you go, my classy lady. You do know you have to talk to her before your date, right? Communication being key and all that jazz.”</p><p>Rio weighed her options, knowing that the chances of her saying something dumb and Agatha inevitably canceling were low, but not entirely non-existent.</p><p>“Fine, fine, you’re right. I’ll text her.” Rio conceded and began typing on her phone.</p><p>Alice peers over Rio’s shoulder and watches her type out “hey” before backspacing and typing “hi” deleting once again and opting for “hey, girl.”</p><p>“Jesus, this is painful. Let me.” Alice grabs her phone.</p><p>“Don’t get weird with it, please,” Rio says, hopping out of the truck at their next stop.</p><p>Alice waves her off.</p><p>
<em>Rio: Hey girl, you look like trash. Let me take you out. </em>
</p><p>Surveying her work proudly, Alice hits send. Three dots appear, then disappear, before a message from Agatha pops up on the screen.</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Nope. </em>
</p><p>Rio returns to the truck, grabbing her phone to assess the damage.</p><p>“Alice! Are you trying to get her to dump me preemptively?” Rio begins to type furiously. Doing some damage control.</p><p>
<em>Rio: Sorry, that was Alice. I respect women deeply. </em>
</p><p>“What? Would’ve worked on me.” Alice shrugs.</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes and turns her attention back to texting Agatha. And if Alice catches her smiling at her phone through most of their shift, she doesn’t mention it. The woman was down catastrophically bad.</p><p> </p><p>Learning about Agatha might be Rio’s new favorite thing. For instance, today she learned that Agatha was a horrible texter. She responded to approximately one text every three hours.</p><p>She learned that Agatha’s coffee order was black and hot. Which, insane. There’s no whimsy in that coffee order.</p><p>She also learned that Agatha was adjusting nicely to life in Westview. She liked the peaceful, slower way of life, which made Rio happy. She didn’t want her to go anywhere anytime soon.</p><p>When Rio pulled into her driveway later that evening, she was looking forward to devouring an entire pizza by herself and checking in with her favorite housewives on Wisteria Lane. Bree Van de Kamp really did things for her. Something about the whole repressed, perfect housewife thing.</p><p><em>I could fix her,</em> Rio thought to herself.</p><p>She loaded her arms up with the pizza and her work stuff, her keys dangling from her mouth. She started toward her house when she felt her phone buzz in her back pocket.</p><p>
<em>Agatha: FuRniture. WeST ElM. Help me? You will. </em>
</p><p>Rio took a beat. This could be a stroke situation, or perhaps Agatha was trying out a Yoda thing. If she was into roleplaying, she probably should have led with that. Not that Rio was against it, it would just take her a second to get into character. Again, not a Star Wars head.</p><p>She decided to give Agatha a call.</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>Agatha sounded a little flustered.</p><p>“Do you smell burnt toast?” Rio asked genuinely.</p><p>“What are you talking about?”</p><p>“Can you raise both arms above your head?”</p><p>“Rio, what is this? Agatha huffed.</p><p>“Your text. I have no idea what you’re trying to ask me.”</p><p>Agatha paused while she reread her message. “Hmm, talk to text. West Elm just dropped off some furniture, and I have no idea what I’m doing. Could you help me?” Agatha asked softly.</p><p>Rio thought about her IKEA furniture she had half-ass thrown together with the help of three to five beers and a prayer. Was she the best candidate for the job? No. Was she going to turn down a pretty lady asking for help? Certainly not.</p><p>“Sure!” Rio said a little too eagerly. “I’ve been told I’m very good with my hands.”</p><p>“I’m sure you are stud,” Agatha purred into the phone. Confidence clearly restored. “The door’s unlocked. I’ll see you soon.”</p><p>Rio gave her brain a mental cold shower before slipping into some shorts and a cut-off. She grabbed the pizza, some tools, and headed out.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had spent a lot of time thinking about what Agatha’s space looked like, and just Agatha in general. She noticed some hanging plants and new shrubbery along the front of the house.</p><p>Even though technically, those shrubs should only receive partial sun, not full sun. Rio appreciated the effort. She’d give Agatha some notes.</p><p>Rio knocked twice before stepping inside.</p><p>She donned her best porn star affectation. “Someone order a pizza? Extra sausage.” She wagged her eyebrows suggestively.</p><p>The house felt warm and inviting, and she had only made it to the entryway. Everything was earth-toned. Deep greens and browns. The walls were filled with art that no doubt cost more than  Rio made in a month.</p><p>The room to her right was filled with a mountain of cardboard boxes it looked like Agatha had yet to unpack. But everything was coming together nicely. It already felt homey, lived in.</p><p>The living room to her left had shelving that was filled wall to wall with books. A very impressive vinyl collection occupied a corner of the room. And a plush couch filled with throw pillows sat in the middle. The warm rays of evening light that filtered through her living room windows made everything feel cozy.</p><p>And in the midst of that cozy living room sat a very disgruntled Agatha surrounded by white instruction pamphlets, screws of all sorts and sizes, and, much to Rio’s surprise, some power tools. The stream of curse words spewing from Agatha’s mouth would have impressed a sailor, but Rio thought she looked adorable with her hair wild and glasses sitting low on her nose.</p><p>“I don’t know, from here it looks like extra ham,” a slightly amused Agatha mumbled.</p><p>“Ya know, I’m pretty sure West Elm offers an assembly service,” Rio said, walking farther into the living room.</p><p>“And let them hustle me out of more money than I’m already paying for this overpriced shit? Fat chance.” Agatha said, looking up from the instruction manual that seemed to be written in a language completely foreign to her.</p><p>“Ah, so call the hot, young thing from down the street to help you out? I like your moves, Harkness.”</p><p>“Plan on helping me anytime soon, or are we going to dwell on your good looks all evening?”</p><p>“Personally, I’m fine with dwelling,” Rio quipped, offering up a devious smile.</p><p>Agatha’s head was buried back in the instruction manual. The vein on the front of her forehead looked like it was about to burst.</p><p>“Okay, Tim the Tool Man.” Rio held out her hand to help Agatha up. “Why don’t you grab a glass of wine, some food, and I’ll start figuring this out.”</p><p>With no smartass retort to offer, Agatha smiled at Rio and walked into the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>Any concern that the two would have nothing to talk about quickly washed away after two glasses of wine.</p><p>Surprisingly, Agatha was an open book, but like one of the protected books, you had to ask the archivists' permission to view and wear special gloves before opening. One wrong move, and that book was snapping shut, and you would never see it again.</p><p>So as Agatha perched on the sofa, and Rio got to work on carefully constructing a coffee table, she listened attentively to what Agatha was willing to share with her and didn’t prod for more.</p><p>She learned that Agatha was from a small town in Ohio. She had a nonexistent relationship with her mother; she moved out the moment she turned 18. She was accepted into Columbia University and worked as a paralegal and waitressed during the evenings to pay tuition and the rent for her shitty fifth floor walk-up.</p><p>After graduating, top of her class, mind you, she got her master's at Columbia Law before she spent several years as an associate at a firm defending soulless corporations before saving up enough money to open a law firm of her own. She had spent the past 12 years specializing in child advocacy cases.</p><p>Rio had moved on to the entertainment stand, and as she idly twisted the Allen wrench, she actively had to keep her jaw from dropping. It wasn’t often that she was so impressed by a human being; more often than not, they tended to let her down.</p><p>And as much as she wanted to gush and tell Agatha how amazing she was and how she wished more people were like her, she wasn’t quite sure how Agatha would receive such genuine praise. Not yet.</p><p>“That’s really incredible, Agatha,” Rio tested the waters, looking up from the now mostly constructed entertainment stand.</p><p>Agatha gave her a small smile and a humble shrug.</p><p>“And when did you become such a vinyl collecting savant?” Rio nodded to the stack of carefully arranged records in the corner.</p><p>Rio noticed the light dull in Agatha’s eyes just a shade.</p><p>Uh, oh.</p><p> A less detail-oriented person would have missed it. She immediately regretted asking her question and braced for the metaphorical book to snap shut. But it didn’t.</p><p>“Oh, that was just something we used to do together in New York.” Agatha’s eyes looked almost glassy as she stared at the shelf holding the records.</p><p>Rio was curious as to who the “we” was, but she clearly hit a sore spot and didn’t probe any further.</p><p>“Welp, I don’t think this bad boy is going anywhere.” Rio slapped the top of the entertainment stand like a dorky dad. She was hoping to subtly bring the mood back up.</p><p>Agatha stood from the couch to assess Rio’s craftsmanship.</p><p>“Well, you do good work, Rio.” Agatha slid her fingers across her new living room furniture.</p><p>With Agatha now fully standing in front of her, Rio glanced at her outfit and chuckled. She was sporting a vintage '98 Lilith Fair t-shirt. How very elder lesbian of her.</p><p>“What’s funny?” Agatha looked at her inquisitively.</p><p>“Nothing, just didn’t picture you as an OG scissor sister,” Rio smirked.</p><p>“Oh, Rio,” Agatha said seductively, inching closer to Rio. “I’ve scissored plenty of sisters in my day. Any other sweeping generalizations you’d like to make about Lilith Fair?”</p><p>Tilting her head coyly, Agatha’s eyes drifted down to Rio’s lips.  </p><p>The visual alone set her brain into overdrive, she guaranteed Agatha had cleaned up back in the day. Hell, she could still be cleaning up now.</p><p>Horny brain Rio wanted nothing more than to crash her lips into Agatha’s, pick her up, and slam her onto the coffee table she had just built.</p><p>And Rio was about 93% sure it would hold. She liked those odds.</p><p>But rational gentleman brain Rio knew that Agatha was a good one, and she wanted to take it slow and at least take her out to dinner first. Then they could fuck nasty. Those were the rules.</p><p>Rio smiled. “No, ma’am.” She grabbed for Agatha’s wrists, stroking her thumb across the back and forcing Agatha to make eye contact with her. “It’s getting late, and I should probably head home. Walk me outside?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio still had her hand wrapped around Agatha’s wrist as she opened the front door and led them onto the porch. It was almost completely dark outside, and the security lights in the neighborhood were casting an orange glow across the sidewalks.</p><p>Rio turned to say goodbye to Agatha when she noticed a security doorbell camera on her porch.</p><p>“Did you get a Ring camera?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Yeah, I heard there was some neighborhood pervert who likes to creep through people’s trash.” Agatha quirked an eyebrow at her.</p><p>“Again, it’s public property,” Rio quipped. “And it tends to really get under the skin of hot lawyer ladies.”</p><p>“Lawyer ladies, plural?” Agatha questioned, stepping further into Rio’s space.</p><p><em>God, I am not your strongest soldier,</em> Rio thought to herself.</p><p>Trying to de-escalate, Rio thought now would be an opportune time to start rambling about full sun shrubbery versus partial sun shrubbery.</p><p>Agatha feigned interest, pretended to be listening, and nodded her head, all while backing Rio into the side of her porch.</p><p>“I like what you’re doing with your bush—bushes, but these shrubs require some shade, and even with intensive watering—” Rio continued to ramble.</p><p>“Rio, please shut up and kiss me,” Agatha interrupted, shoving Rio roughly against the wall.</p><p>And once again, who was Rio to tell a pretty lady no?</p><p>Rio’s back struck the wood hard, and Agatha was on her instantly. Her lips were full, warm, insistent.</p><p>Agatha led the kiss completely. Her hands gripping Rio’s hips, thumbs stroking over the exposed skin where her shirt had begun to ride up.</p><p>Rio felt her mouth part as she moaned into Agatha embarrassingly fast. Agatha took that as an opportunity to slip her tongue in between Rio’s lips. She tasted like plums and blackberries from the wine they had shared earlier.</p><p>As Agatha’s tongue continued to explore her mouth, Rio’s hands found their way into Agatha’s impossibly soft hair—she pulled her in closer. She wanted Agatha to devour her.</p><p>She could feel Agatha’s heart slamming into her chest against her own.</p><p>Horny brain Rio was absolutely beating rational gentleman brain Rio to a pulp.</p><p>A now panting Agatha pulled back to look Rio in the eyes. Her face was flushed, pupils dilated, lips red and swollen. She leaned back in to suck Rio’s bottom lip into her mouth before stopping again.</p><p>“Be a good girl and spread your legs for me,” Agatha whispered into Rio’s ear.</p><p>To punctuate her point, she guided two fingers down to Rio’s inner thigh and tapped twice.</p><p>A feral groan started low in the base of Rio’s throat before slipping past her lips. She parted her legs instantly. She was sure her body would do anything Agatha asked of it—snapping to attention like an obedient soldier.</p><p>Agatha flashed Rio a wicked smile before pressing hot, wet kisses along her jaw. She dipped her head, taking broad licks at the column of Rio’s throat. She tasted earthy and sweet with just a hint of sweat from the stress of the day.</p><p>Rio let out a small whimper before Agatha slotted her thigh between Rio’s legs. The warm, solid flesh of her thigh was pressing the seam of Rio’s shorts deliciously against her clit.</p><p>Rio let her head fall backwards as her hips rolled forward, grinding down on Agatha.</p><p>Agatha continued her assault on Rio’s neck and collarbones—nipping and sucking.</p><p>“Does that feel good?” Agatha took Rio’s earlobe into her mouth and bit down.</p><p>Rio’s hips stuttered. “Fuck, Ag—Agatha it feels so good.”</p><p>Rio continued to ride Agatha’s thigh as she ran her hands up and down Rio’s sides—pushing and pulling and squeezing. Touching as much of Rio as possible.  </p><p>She let her fingers slide up Rio’s abs over her shirt before reaching her breasts. She kneaded them roughly. Rio felt her nipples begin to stiffen beneath the fabric.</p><p>“Mmm, Agatha.” Rio let out a whiny moan.</p><p>“Tell me, pretty girl,” Agatha whispered as her hands returned to Rio’s hips, grabbing them harshly. “Do you think about me when you touch yourself?”</p><p>It’s like this woman was in her head.</p><p>“Yes, I only ever think of you,” Rio groaned out. “When you were out of town, I got off thinking about fucking you.”</p><p>She shocked herself with the truthful admission. Horny brain.</p><p>This must have set off something primal in Agatha’s brain. She guided Rio’s hips to grind against her harder and faster. Rio could feel her arousal soaking through the denim on her shorts and onto Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>That familiar aching in her gut was building slowly. Her cunt clenching around nothing—whole body feeling like a raw nerve.</p><p>She knew she would come if they didn’t stop soon. And she’d be dammed if her 28-year-old self was coming in her shorts from a little over the clothes action. She was an adult.</p><p>But when Agatha moaned and pressed her thigh into Rio a little harder, she felt herself start to crest over the edge.</p><p>“Wait, wait,” Rio moaned out, biting down on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>Agatha stilled her motions, but kept her thigh firmly slotted between Rio’s legs.</p><p>“What, you’re not gonna come for me, are you, baby?” Agatha teased.</p><p>That did it. Rio’s whole body locked up and shuddered. Her head tilted back, and her mouth opened in a silent scream.</p><p>Never had she been more thankful for those shrubs that Agatha would eventually kill for shielding them from the neighbors.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha,” Rio moaned as her hips continued to buck against her thigh.</p><p>Agatha held Rio tight against her until she stilled. Rio’s head was buried in her neck.</p><p>A little embarrassed, Rio didn’t make eye contact with her immediately, but of course, when she did, Agatha was sporting the smuggest smile known to man.</p><p>“Now, if I didn’t know any better, I’d say I just made you come in your pants, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio groaned. She knew Agatha would be a little shit about this.</p><p>“Agatha, have you seen yourself? I would have been more concerned if I didn’t come in my pants because that would mean my pussy is broken. And that sounds expensive.”</p><p>Agatha laughed loudly before leaning in to cup Rio’s face, gently pressing their lips together. This kiss wasn’t rushed; it was slow and soft, and Rio let her body melt into Agatha, locking her arms around her.</p><p>Rio felt one of Agatha’s hands start to travel down her chest and stomach before finding its destination between Rio’s legs. She cupped her over her shorts, feeling the effect she had on Rio’s body.</p><p>She let her forehead fall against Agatha’s as another pathetic whine escaped her mouth.</p><p>Before they could go for round two, both stilled at the sound of a door clicking shut, and what sounded like some shrill humming—Mrs. Davis.</p><p>Rio pulled Agatha tight against her, silently begging her to be quiet.</p><p>But, Agatha, being the menace she was, had other plans.</p><p>She pulled herself away from Rio, fixing her hair and smoothing down her clothes.</p><p>“Hi, Mrs. Hart!” Agatha plastered on a smile and waved to her neighbor.</p><p>Rio couldn’t believe this woman.</p><p>Sharon whipped around. “Oh, it’s Mrs. Davis dear. And is that Rio?”</p><p>Agatha pulled Rio from behind the shelter of the shrubs.</p><p>“Yes, she’s just been a doll. She helped me put together some furniture and even gave me some tips on how to manage my bush.”</p><p>Agatha’s tongue pressed to the side of her cheek as she glanced at Rio.</p><p>Rio could see the glint of mischief in her eyes. The little sadist was enjoying this.</p><p>“She was actually just heading out. You guys should walk together.”</p><p><em>No, no, no. </em>Rio groaned internally.</p><p>“Well, I would just love that!” Mrs. Davis said in her sing-songy voice.</p><p>“Can’t wait for our date, dear,” Agatha said in a sickly-sweet voice.  </p><p>Rio covertly flipped off Agatha and made her way down the sidewalk.</p><p>Fucking she-devil.</p><p>Agatha laughed as she watched Rio waddle the whole way home as Mrs. Davis peppered her with questions.</p><p>And if later that evening, Agatha found her hand sliding beneath her pajama shorts as she rewatched the doorbell video of Rio falling apart on her front porch, Rio would be none the wiser.</p><p> </p>

<p>“Alright, ladies, it’s time to focus up.” Rio finished writing on a whiteboard. “We are t-minus one day away from my date with Agatha, and I still have no idea where I’m taking her. I expect some really thoughtful and inspired feedback in the five minutes I gave you to prepare.”</p><p>Rio snapped the lid shut on the dry-erase marker and looked expectantly at Lilia and Alice.</p><p>“Rio, you better put that whiteboard back in my office.”</p><p>“In due time, Lilia,” Rio said. “Now, thoughts?”</p><p>“What restaurant were you thinking of?” Alice asked.</p><p>“Well, Alice, I’m glad you asked. I’m open to Mexican, Thai, or Chinese. We’re ruling out Indian for now because it hurts my tummy. We’ll save that for like the 10<sup>th</sup> date when she’s locked in and obsessed with me.”</p><p>“The fucking naan, dude.” Alice groaned.</p><p>“The fucking naan, dude.” Rio nodded in agreement.</p><p>“What about a movie?” Lilia asked.</p><p>Rio considered it. “Historically, not my favorite option for a first date because I can’t talk to her the whole time. But I do love a good back row fumble.” Rio wagged her eyebrows suggestively.</p><p>“I also loved a good back row fumble,” Lilia said with a smirk.</p><p>“Oh, I bet you do, you little freak.” Rio winked, earning her a death stare from Lilia.</p><p>“What about a museum date? Alice asked.</p><p>“I don’t know. Those always feel a little stuffy to me. Plus, she lived in New York for like ever, so she’s probably visited every museum worth seeing.”</p><p>“What’s the street fair date?” Alice asked, pointing at Rio’s handwriting on the whiteboard.</p><p>“Oh.” Rio suddenly got kind of shy. “Well, I mean, she’s new to town, so I thought maybe I’d take her to the street fair downtown. There’s always good food, music, and carnival games.”</p><p>Rio twisted the marker around nervously in her hands.</p><p>“I just know how stressful and tough her job can be sometimes, and it would be nice to see her let loose. I want her to feel like she can let her guard down around me and have fun. She’s seriously so funny. And oh my god, her laugh. Her nose does the cute little scrunched up thing when she –”</p><p>Rio realizes she’s rambling, and both Lilia and Alice are staring at her with open mouths.</p><p>“You are down so incredibly bad, dude.” Alice laughs and gets up to leave the break room. “My vote is for the street fair. She’ll love it.”</p><p>Rio was no stranger to first dates. She had been on plenty throughout her 20s. She’d had second dates that probably shouldn’t have happened, a few regrettable blind dates, one-night stands, but this was different. Agatha felt different.</p><p>Rio erased the whiteboard and picked it up to take it back to Lilia’s office.</p><p>“You have a kind and beautiful heart, Rio.” Lilia gives her shoulder a squeeze. “Make sure she’s gentle with it.”</p><p> </p><p>Now, Rio wasn’t having a panic attack, but she also wasn’t not having a panic attack—all the signs were pointing toward one. The discarded outfit pile on her bed was growing larger by the minute.</p><p>Ultimately, she settled on some black high-waisted jeans, which made her ass look great, a black cropped t-shirt, and a light blue button up. She popped on her small chain necklace over the shirt. Rio wasn’t certain, but she was pretty sure some of her gay points got deducted every time she left the house without it.</p><p>Rio gave herself a once-over in the mirror, and she looked good, like really good. But she had to to keep up with her date. She told Agatha to dress casually, but who knows what the minx would whip out.</p><p>“You look hot, and this date is going to go great,” Rio said, looking into the mirror and taking a deep breath.</p><p>“And you’re going to behave yourself. I’m looking at you.” She pointed to her vagina.</p><p>She really needed to get out of the house more often.</p><p>Rio grabbed her car keys and stepped onto her front porch before doubling back to grab some garden shears and heading to her backyard. She carefully clipped off a handful of lilacs from her bush and arranged them into a bouquet for Agatha—romantic as hell.</p><p> </p><p>Five minutes later, a slightly less nervous, but still jittery, Rio is standing on Agatha’s front porch waiting for her to come outside. Agatha opens the door, stepping out in loose-fitting jeans, sneakers, a vintage The Cure shirt, and an oversized cardigan.</p><p>Her brown hair is flowing in soft waves across her shoulders, and she’s sporting another pair of large glasses. Rio wonders just how many pairs she has.</p><p>She is pretty sure it should be illegal to look as good as Agatha does in just normal people clothes.</p><p>She looks like a sexy librarian with excellent music taste, Rio thinks to herself.</p><p>“Um, thanks, I think.” Agatha laughs.</p><p>
<em>Oops, didn’t mean to say that out loud. </em>
</p><p>“I picked these for you,” Rio says, extending the lilacs to Agatha and recovering nicely.</p><p>Agatha stares at them for a minute.</p><p>“Purple flowers were his favorite,” she says softly.</p><p>“Who?” Rio asked, feeling a little braver today.</p><p>This broke Agatha out of her daze.</p><p> “Oh, nothing. Thank you.” She gave Rio a light kiss. “I’m going to put these in some water, and then we can head out.” Agatha’s smile returned to her face.</p><p>Rio clocked it, but she wasn’t going to dwell on it today.</p><p>She opened the passenger door for Agatha before sliding into the driver’s seat.</p><p>“I didn’t even hear you pull in your car is so quiet,” Agatha said.</p><p>“That’s the power of an electric vehicle, baby,” Rio said, rubbing the dashboard.</p><p>Agatha snorted.</p><p>“So, how do you feel about the Barenaked Ladies?” Rio asked, thumbing through a music app on her phone.</p><p>“The in real life ones, great,” Agatha quipped. “The Canadian 90s band, not so much.”</p><p>“Your loss, I know every single word to 'One Week,' and it’s very impressive.” Rio placed her hand on Agatha’s thigh like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>
<strong>Agatha</strong>
</p><p>Agatha could count on one hand the amount of dates she had been on in her life. Her 20s were spent grinding through school and clawing her way to the top. Making something of herself—creating a life that 13-year-old Ohio Agatha never thought she had a chance at.</p><p>And once she made it, she thought she would have some time to focus on her personal goals, but life had other plans.</p><p>Running her own firm and dealing with stuff in her personal life took up any and all time she would have had to pursue a relationship. Sure, she had flings to blow off some steam, but that was only fulfilling for the few hours she had a warm body next to her.</p><p>As Agatha approached her mid-40s, she found some solace in being alone. She liked her space and her routine. She liked doing whatever she wanted when she wanted to do it.</p><p>But on the rare occasion when she let the feeling of loneliness creep in, she found herself thinking, maybe this is what she deserved. It was a form of self-flagellation, she supposed. She had prioritized success and her career her whole life, so maybe she didn’t deserve a partner, a family.</p><p>And don’t worry, she’s been in therapy for years. But even the best therapist money can buy can’t always stop the negative thoughts from rearing their ugly head. Agatha could regurgitate therapy talk with the best of them—applying the advice to her actual life was easier said than done.</p><p>But as Agatha listened to Rio ramble about her day and whatever other random thoughts popped into her head, <em>the woman had a weird brain</em>; she found herself fascinated by how easy and comfortable this all felt. She could listen to Rio talk for hours, and the warmth of her hand on her thigh was so grounding and domestic—something Agatha wasn’t ever sure she wanted.</p><p>Agatha was a perceptive woman by nature; her job required it. She could tell Rio was very in her head. They were nowhere close to the easy silence part of their relationship yet.</p><p>And Agatha understood. She was a very intimidating presence and refused to make herself smaller for anyone. But she could tell Rio was up for the challenge from the little things she had been learning about her.</p><p>“No joke, like 20 raccoons crawled out of the dumpster,” Rio said, wrapping up her story. “And that’s why we always carry a long plank with us in the truck.”</p><p>Rio parked the car, and as Agatha looked around, she realized they were at some sort of street festival. There were vendor booths, food trucks, tents with live music, and a huge crowd of people—not necessarily Agatha’s favorite, she wasn’t a social butterfly.</p><p>Rio must have sensed her apprehension because as soon as they got out of the car, her hand was on the small of her back, offering reassurance.  </p><p>“We’ll check it out, and if you’re not feeling it, we can go somewhere else.” Rio gave her a small smile.</p><p>Agatha felt herself start to relax as they weaved their way through the various vendor booths, looking at local artists’ trinkets.</p><p>It seemed like Rio knew everyone they came into contact with, and she was always sure to introduce Agatha and include her in the conversation.</p><p>As the two walked around to find somewhere to eat for dinner, Rio noticed a sack race competition and dragged Agatha over to watch.</p><p>“Oh my god, look at how bad they are,” Rio laughed.</p><p>“They’re literally children, Rio.”</p><p>“Okay, first off, anyone can enter the sack race, and two, fuck them kids. Watch this.” Rio said, darting off to the start line.</p><p>Agatha was only slightly mortified as she watched Rio climb into a large sack and line up right beside a bunch of children. Rio gave Agatha a big wave before she started purposely bumping into some of the kids just to mess with them.</p><p>She wasn’t prepared for how seeing Rio be so good with kids would make her feel. Rio had said she had a big family, so she supposed it made sense.</p><p>The race started, and Agatha felt her face break into a huge grin as she watched Rio chase the kids instead of participating in the race, the kids laughing so hard they could barely move. Rio kept up with them, but made sure to pull back and face plant before she could cross the finish line, so she came in last place.</p><p>“That shit was rigged,” Rio laughed, jogging back to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>The two settled on a German food truck that had a large tent set up beside it with picnic benches and a live polka band.</p><p>“So, can I ask you something?” Rio brought two large steins of beer back to their table and sat down.</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha eyed her curiously.</p><p>“That note you left me on the first day we met was that just your bad attempt at flirting?”</p><p>Agatha feigned offense. “Excuse me, that was well-deserved feedback on your job performance.” She paused. “Plus, it worked, didn’t it?”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah. So what I’m hearing is you had a thing for me instantly.” Rio said, grabbing Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“Of course, that’s what you’d zero in on.” Agatha laughed. “Yes, Rio. I suppose I found you conventionally attractive.”</p><p>“Mmm, five sweetest words in the English language: ‘I found you conventionally attractive.’”</p><p>The announcer onstage started calling for participants for a stein-holding contest.</p><p>“You wanna bet I can beat all of their asses?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha eyed the competition. Most of them are six foot six-foot-tall, very lean dudes. “Okay, mighty mouse, you’re scrappy, but also like a third of their body weight.”</p><p>“I am very impressive, Agatha.” Rio took off her button-up, winked at Agatha, grabbed her stein, and joined the rest of the competitors on stage.</p><p>The rules were simple: whoever could hold a full stein out in front of them the longest wins. They were barely a minute in, and the competition was dropping like flies.</p><p>Six-foot-tall athlete types, gym bros, and surprisingly fit soccer moms all tapped out until it was just Rio and a very large bearded man.</p><p>Rio hadn’t budged. The muscles in her forearm were straining, and her bicep was fully flexed—Agatha wanted to lick it. They were approaching the six-minute mark, with no sign of a compromise in sight.</p><p>Agatha noticed the large man beside Rio start to sweat, but what she didn’t notice was a covert deal Rio was secretly making with her competitor.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Agatha, Rio knew this man well. She worked with him. And in exchange for her picking up one of his shifts, he was willing to throw the competition.</p><p>Sure, Rio would have to work more and ultimately gain nothing except bragging rights and hopefully a shot in the dark of impressing Agatha, but it was worth it in her book.</p><p>Rio told her coworker to really put some theatrics into the loss, so she smirked when he started violently twitching his arm and let his stein drop into the grass. The crowd cheered, and Rio made a big show of flexing her muscles before returning to Agatha.</p><p>“I told you I’m very impressive,” Rio said, smugly dropping down into her seat next to Agatha.</p><p>“You did.” Agatha reached out to grab Rio’s arm and began massaging the sore muscle.</p><p>“And you owe me a funnel cake,” Rio garbled through a mouthful of pretzel and beer cheese.</p><p>“You’re asking me for more food while you’re eating?”</p><p>“Mhmm.” Rio nodded.</p><p>As Agatha continued to knead Rio’s arm, feeling her muscles flex under her fingers, her mind wandered to the many other places of Rio’s body she’d like to get her hands on.</p><p>It was her personality, her laugh, the way everyone seemed to fall a little in love with her—Agatha couldn’t find a single thing about the woman she didn’t like. She was infectious. It was kind of annoying.</p><p>As the band returned to the stage, Agatha heard them playing the beginning notes of “The Chicken Dance,” and the energy in the tent shifted.</p><p>Rio clapped her hands together. “Okay, this is going to sound weird, but you have to stand on the picnic table and do the chicken dance.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her like she had two heads, but noticed others around her beginning to stand on their tables.</p><p>“What are you talking about?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Exactly what I said,” Rio said, climbing onto the table and offering Agatha her hand. “It’s literally offensive if you don’t. You don’t want to be culturally insensitive, do you?”</p><p>Agatha supposed not, so she grabbed Rio’s hand and climbed onto their table as the song began. She felt ridiculous, but everyone around her also looked ridiculous, so she was in good company.</p><p>She followed Rio’s lead and thought it would be one and done, but the band began to play the song again, and faster. On the fourth run through of the song, Agatha forgot how ridiculous she felt, focusing on flying through the motions of the dance.</p><p>She felt herself laughing at herself and with everyone around her. Rio’s wide grin encouraged her. She couldn’t remember the last time she laughed that hard.</p><p>The song eventually ended, the polka band seamlessly transitioning into another upbeat song as people climbed down from their tables.</p><p>“So, about that funnel cake.” Rio looked at Agatha expectantly.</p><p>“There's no way you’re already hungry. You have the appetite of a teenage boy.”</p><p>Rio just grinned and nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“Back in Ohio, we had funnel cakes, but we also had these things called elephant ears,” Agatha explained as the two walked and shared their dessert. “It’s basically the same thing except they add cinnamon sugar.”</p><p>“That sounds good, but the name is a little fucked up.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “That’s the Midwest for you.”</p><p>The sun had set, and much of the crowd had died down. The majority of the fair was now lit by the carnival rides and game booths.</p><p>Rio was making light work of the funnel cake when Agatha noticed some powdered sugar had settled on Rio’s upper lip.</p><p>“Here, you’ve got something on your mouth,” Agatha said, wiping her thumb across Rio’s lip.</p><p>Rio’s brown eyes looked at her in surprise. Her lip felt warm and soft beneath her fingertip—Agatha’s hand still lingering and cradling her jaw.</p><p>What Agatha didn’t expect was for Rio to wrap her fingers around her wrist and suck her thumb into her mouth, licking off the remaining sugar. Her tongue was hot and wet against the pad of her finger.</p><p>Agatha barely had time to let out a small whimper before Rio was pulling her into an isolated alley—the funnel cake long forgotten, but properly disposed of because Rio doesn’t litter.</p><p>Rio pulled Agatha in by her cardigan before crashing their lips together. She sucked Agatha’s bottom lip into her mouth, while slowly backing them into the brick wall. Agatha’s fingers wove their way through Rio’s hair, scratching at her scalp and tugging lightly, pulling her closer.</p><p>Rio’s fingers dug into Agatha’s waist, their hips now flush. Both were trying to lead the kiss, but neither succeeded, so it was just a sloppy competition of who could get the most of each other in the other’s mouth. Their teeth scraped together while they panted and moaned.</p><p>Agatha could feel Rio trying to take control—something she wasn’t entirely comfortable giving up yet. She flipped their position on the wall, thrusting her tongue into Rio’s mouth. She tasted sweet, and Agatha craved so much more.</p><p>She let her hands run down Rio’s sides before working them under the hem of her shirt. Agatha splayed her hand across the warm flesh of Rio’s abs. Rio tensed under her fingers and rocked her hips against Agatha.</p><p>Agatha pulled back to drag her teeth across Rio’s neck as her hand moved up farther underneath her shirt.</p><p>Her thumb had just grazed the bottom of Rio’s bra when Agatha felt Rio’s hand land on top of hers.</p><p>“I’d hate to catch an indecent exposure charge,” Rio panted.</p><p>“It’s a good thing I know a lawyer,” Agatha mumbled against the skin of Rio’s neck.</p><p>“Oh yeah, do you think she could get me off?”</p><p>“I think she could get you off so good and so fast.”</p><p>Rio moaned and guided Agatha’s hand underneath her bra and onto her breast.</p><p>Agatha groaned into the touch. It felt so good to finally touch Rio. Her tits were small and perky. The soft, warm flesh melded perfectly into the palm of her hand.</p><p>Rio whined as Agatha squeezed, her nipple hardening into a stiff peak as she continually ran her thumb across it in slow, small circles, occasionally stopping to pinch and roll it between her fingers.</p><p>Agatha tugged Rio’s shirt up higher and dipped her head to take Rio’s nipple into her mouth when they heard a large group laughing in the distance, stilling their actions.</p><p>
<em>Oh yeah, very large and very public street festival. </em>
</p><p>Rio lowered her shirt and grabbed Agatha’s hand, kissing her knuckles. “Let’s get out of here.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is worked up. No, that’s an understatement. Agatha’s whole body is vibrating, and she’s pretty sure that if Rio doesn’t touch her soon, she’s going to die.</p><p>And it doesn’t help that the absolutely maddening woman is currently singing about “chickity China the Chinese chicken” all while rubbing small circles with her thumb dangerously high on her inner thigh.</p><p>To Rio’s credit, she absolutely did know every single word to “One Week.”  But god, did Agatha hate the Barenaked Ladies, specifically in this moment.  </p><p>Agatha kept squirming in her seat, trying her best to get Rio’s fingers to move up higher where she was aching for them. But if Rio noticed, she only smirked about it, which annoyed Agatha even more.</p><p>By the time they pulled into Agatha’s driveway, she was ready to crawl into Rio’s lap and have her in the driver’s seat. But she didn’t, she was a lady.</p><p>Rio walked her to her front door, stopping just outside.</p><p>“I had a really great time with you tonight, Agatha,” Rio said.</p><p>“So did I.” Agatha attempted to pull Rio in closer by her belt loops.</p><p>But Rio stopped before their bodies could touch.</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrow. “Are you serious?”</p><p>“Deadly.” Rio extended an arm, placing it on the wood of the door above Agatha’s head.</p><p>Agatha attempted once more to pull Rio closer to her, but she didn’t budge—just simply bent down and offered Agatha a chaste kiss on the cheek.</p><p>A pathetic moan slipped past her lips.</p><p>Rio smiled before placing her lips next to her ear. “You love it—the anticipation,” she whispered.</p><p>“Goodnight, Agatha.” Rio propelled herself off the door, looking very pleased with herself, returned to her car, and drove home.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did not, in fact, love the anticipation. She was 42-years-old and she knew what she wanted and that was to get fucked and fucked well— preferably by Rio. No, definitely by Rio.</p><p>This was more than just sex for Agatha, and she knew it was for Rio, too. She could see the gears constantly turning in Rio’s head.</p><p>At this point in her life, Agatha craved more than a physical connection; she needed something deeper and mental stimulation—something she believed she found in Rio.</p><p>But communication had never been a particular strength of Agatha’s. And if Rio needed to take this slow, Agatha would happily oblige, but she needed to at least test the waters.</p><p>Which is how she found herself on Rio’s front porch a few days later, picking the lock to her front door three hours before she was due home.</p><p>And the worst part was her neighbors just waved at Agatha while she was doing it. The security in this neighborhood was seriously lacking.</p><p>Rio’s house was very her. Everything was extremely neat, which Agatha appreciated. Plants covered almost every open space of the house—vines even creeping up the walls. She had an impressive music collection and a bass guitar sitting in a corner of the living room, which Agatha made a mental note to ask her about later.</p><p>And apparently, Rio ran hot because her house was freezing. Agatha easily located Rio’s bedroom. Her bed was made military style neat, not a single wrinkle in the comforter. There was a handful of books stacked on her bedside table that Agatha would sleuth through when she had more time.</p><p>She rummaged through Rio’s closet, slipping one of her old college hoodies over her head. Being wrapped in Rio’s scent gave her an immediate sense of comfort. She made her way back downstairs and started cooking dinner.</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>Rio</strong>
</p><p>Rio immediately noticed that her kitchen light was on when she pulled into her driveway that evening. She didn’t remember leaving it on when she ran out the door this morning.</p><p>She pulls out her keys to unlock her door, but is surprised when the doorknob turns without the twist of her key. The alarm bells start to go off, but are quickly muted by the smell of something heavenly coming from her kitchen. Her burglar could steal whatever they wanted as long as she could eat whatever that was.</p><p>Rio made her way to the kitchen and paused in the doorway—and there was Agatha wearing her clothes, in her kitchen, making her food—it made her heart flutter.  It was all so soft and perfect. She wanted it to be real so bad, and she needed Agatha to want that too.</p><p>“Trespassing and now breaking and entering,” Rio said, making her way over to Agatha. “Do I need to call the police?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t,” Agatha said, not bothering to look up from the stove. “It would backfire. I found your pot plants when I went into your greenhouse to get some vegetables.”</p><p>“What?” Rio played dumb. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“Mhmmm.”</p><p>Rio chuckled and wrapped her arms around Agatha’s waist, kissing her neck. Agatha let out a contented sigh and relaxed into Rio’s touch, letting her kiss her neck a little longer before turning around in her arms.</p><p>“You know, you could have just asked for my spare key.”</p><p>“Honestly, I wanted to see if I still had my lock-picking skills. Still got it.”</p><p>The two continued exchanging soft kisses until Rio slipped her hands under the back of Agatha’s thighs, lifting her onto the kitchen counter and burying her head into Agatha’s neck.</p><p>Agatha held her there for a minute. “Rio, I’m going to say this with only love in my heart, you stink.”</p><p>Rio laughed hard. “It comes with the job, baby. What’s all of this for?” Rio gestures to the food sitting on the stove.</p><p>“I just wanted to do something nice for you,” Agatha said, giving Rio a small kiss on the nose. “Why don’t you go shower and then we can eat?”</p><p>Food was Rio’s biggest motivator. She was in and out of the shower within five minutes, slipping on a pair of boxers and a t-shirt before heading back downstairs, taking two steps at a time.</p><p>She finds Agatha standing in the hallway between her kitchen and living room, staring at the family pictures she has hanging on the wall. A strange sense of comfort creeps in from seeing Agatha in her space.</p><p>Rio walks up behind Agatha, rests her chin on her shoulder, and places her hands on her hips.</p><p>“You have a huge family,” Agatha says, a hint of sadness in her voice. She’s looking at a group picture from Rio’s college graduation.</p><p>“Oh yeah, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, the whole gang,” Rio says, still holding Agatha. “They’re going to love you.”</p><p>It slips out before Rio thinks better of it. She feels Agatha tense under her hands, and Rio opens her mouth to walk back her statement, but is stopped by Agatha pulling her into a searing kiss.</p><p>Agatha’s hands grip her jaw and the back of her neck as she keeps their lips connected, slowly walking them into the living room.</p><p>“But what about dinner?” Rio says through a mouthful of Agatha.</p><p>Agatha laughs and pushes Rio against the couch. “Sit, and don’t touch.”</p><p>And Rio sits, hands at her sides. Her lips are kiss swollen and she keeps her eyes trained on Agatha—awaiting her next command.</p><p>“I watch you, Rio,” Agatha says, unbuttoning her pants and letting them pool at her feet. “Just as closely as you watch me.” Agatha shrugs off Rio’s sweatshirt, letting it fall to the floor.</p><p>Rio can feel her fingers dig into her couch, trying to be good, as a half-naked Agatha stands just inches from her.</p><p>“Don’t overthink this, Rio.” Agatha slips her t-shirt over her head, now just standing in her black lace bra and matching underwear. “I want this. I want you. All of you.”</p><p>“I want to learn you.” She steps closer to Rio. “I want you to learn me. I want to know what makes you feel good.”</p><p>Agatha straddles Rio, grabbing Rio’s hands and placing them on her ass.</p><p>Rio rests them there gently.</p><p>“You’re not going to break me, Rio.”</p><p>Rio takes that as an invitation and gives her ass a firm squeeze, earning her a moan from Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers move to the front clasp of her bra, and Rio feels her eyes drop to her chest.</p><p>“Look at me,” Agatha orders, holding her now loosened bra against her.</p><p>When Rio makes eye contact with Agatha, she lets the straps fall down her arms, the piece of clothing joining the rest on the floor.</p><p>Rio lets her eyes linger on Agatha’s for a little longer before letting them drop and taking in the vision that is an almost completely naked Agatha Harkness sitting in her lap.</p><p>She takes in the smattering of freckles across her chest, her rosy pink nipples hardened from arousal and the cool air, the soft curve of her belly, the silver stretch marks that snake across her hips and inner thighs.</p><p>“God, Agatha, you are stunning.” Rio looks at Agatha with complete reverence.</p><p>She needed her hands and mouth to be everywhere, but she was overwhelmed, her hands glued to Agatha’s hips.</p><p>Agatha moves Rio’s hands and hooks her fingers into her underwear. “Take them off.”</p><p>Rio slowly slides the fabric over her thighs. Agatha lifts her knees so Rio can take them completely off.</p><p>Her eyes dropping between Agatha’s legs—her neatly trimmed bush damp with arousal.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitches, and she feels her hips involuntarily buck into Agatha. Slowly, she trails her hands up Agatha’s thighs until Agatha places her hands over hers, halting her movements.</p><p>“Not yet,” Agatha said, her eyes boring holes into Rio’s.</p><p>She brings Rio’s dominant hand up to her mouth and languidly kisses her fingertips before folding all but her index and middle fingers. Still making eye contact with Rio, Agatha takes the fingers into her mouth, parting them with her tongue, making sure they’re thoroughly coated in her spit.</p><p>Rio groans and lets her head fall back against her couch. Agatha removes Rio’s wet fingers from her mouth and trails them down her body—between her breasts, down her stomach, until they reach the apex of her thighs.</p><p>Rio is looking at Agatha like she hung the moon and stars, and who’s to say she didn’t?</p><p>Agatha guides Rio’s two fingers through her damp, coarse curls—finally allowing Rio to part her folds, dragging them through her wetness from her clit to her entrance.</p><p>The two let out a tandem moan as Agatha begins rocking her hips back and forth against Rio’s fingers. Rio can’t believe how wet this woman is for her.</p><p>Agatha lets go of Rio’s hand, allowing her some freedom, tossing her head back and getting lost in the sensations. Rio continues to stroke Agatha, her fingers parting into a ‘v’ to tease her clit before sliding down and lightly tracing her entrance with the tip of her finger.</p><p>Agatha leans forward to capture Rio’s lips, licking into her mouth. Rio whimpers as Agatha’s hand clutches at her throat—her hips starting to move erratically.</p><p>“Rio, I need you inside me.” Agatha moans into Rio’s mouth.</p><p>Rio’s fingers are coated in Agatha, and she plants them firmly atop her thigh, inviting Agatha to lower herself on them.</p><p>She watches in awe as Agatha slowly takes her fingers, her lips parting at the delicious stretch, eyes rolling back, and head dropping backwards.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha,” Rio let out a whine. Agatha felt so wet and tight around her fingers.</p><p>Once Rio was as deep as she could go, Agatha stilled, getting accustomed to the stretch. Rio began to curl and pulse her fingers inside Agatha, earning her a feral groan.</p><p>“Keep doing that, baby,” Agatha moaned. “You’re doing so good, Rio. So good.”</p><p>She began to writhe up and down, fucking herself on Rio’s fingers. Agatha dropped one hand between her legs to play with her clit, and brought the other up to fist in the hair at the nape of Rio’s neck.</p><p>Rio’s head snapped back as she watched Agatha continue to fuck herself on her fingers. Her tits bouncing with each thrust, her brow furrowed in pleasure and concentration.</p><p>Rio decided right then and there that she would happily be Agatha’s sex toy any day of the week.</p><p>Agatha’s movements became more haphazard and erratic, her cunt fluttering against Rio’s fingers—she was getting close.</p><p>“Put your mouth on me,” Agatha groaned, pulling Rio’s head against her chest.</p><p>Rio happily licked and kissed the valley between Agatha’s breasts. She flattened her tongue and dragged it across a nipple before taking it into her mouth, lightly sucking as a whine slipped past Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“Rio, I’m gonna come,” Agatha whimpered. Her finger now swiping furiously against her clit.</p><p>Rio felt Agatha’s body begin to tense, and took the opportunity to wrap her free arm around Agatha’s waist, allowing her to meet Agatha’s thrusts, fucking her deeper.</p><p>“Oh, fuck, Rio!” Feral noises ripped from Agatha’s throat as her body began to spasm.</p><p>Rio looked up from her place between Agatha’s breasts to watch her fall apart. And if there was a more gorgeous sight on Earth, Rio had yet to see it in her nearly 30 years of existence.</p><p>Agatha reached down to still Rio’s movements between her legs, slowly pulling Rio out of her. She let herself fall forward, her forehead resting against Rio’s.</p><p>Agatha brought Rio’s fingers up to her mouth, “Open.”</p><p>Rio obediently took her fingers into her mouth and sucked. Groaning at the taste. Her senses were overwhelmed by Agatha.</p><p>“You did so good, baby.” Agatha trailed kisses down Rio’s neck.</p><p>Rio felt her heart swelling at the praise and the nickname. She was learning that she loved being good for Agatha.</p><p>She watched as Agatha slowly dropped to the floor between Rio’s legs. She gathered her hair and threw it messily into a bun on the top of her head before resting her head against Rio’s thigh.</p><p>“I’m not going to last long,” Rio said, stroking Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>“Are you kidding? After that show I just put on for you, I’d be offended if you lasted more than a minute.” Agatha winked at her.</p><p>“Ever so humble.” Rio rolled her eyes before grabbing a throw pillow to place under Agatha’s knees.</p><p>Agatha rose on her knees to kiss Rio deeply. Her hands wandered to the hem of Rio’s shirt before pulling it over her head.</p><p>Rio arched her back, her dusky nipples hard and begging for Agatha’s attention, which she gladly gave them. She slowly kissed and licked and sucked before pulling back to take a look at her work.</p><p>Rio’s chest heaved as it shone with red, wet marks from Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>“So pretty,” Agatha said, running her hand down from the flat plane of Rio’s abs to the start of her hips.</p><p>Agatha dipped her fingers beneath the waistband of Rio’s boxers, silently looking up at her for permission. Rio raised her hips while Agatha pulled the fabric down her legs, allowing herself to be completely bare for Agatha.</p><p>Agatha returned her head to Rio’s thigh, taking her in. Rio knew she was soaked, the cold air making her already sensitive clit pulse.</p><p>Agatha placed warm, open-mouthed kisses up her thighs, her hips—Rio felt her hips cant toward Agatha’s mouth. She wrapped her arms around Rio’s knees and pulled her to the edge of the couch before spreading her legs open wider.</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha leaned forward and nuzzled into the hair between her thighs—breathing her in before placing a kiss on her clit.</p><p>She spread Rio with her fingers before dragging her index finger through her, coating it in her wetness. Agatha popped it into her mouth and sucked, moaning at the taste.</p><p>“Baby, please,” Rio begged, as she began to squirm.</p><p>Agatha flattened her tongue and gave one broad stroke from Rio’s entrance to her clit. Rio felt her eyes roll back as her body arched, trying to get closer to Agatha.</p><p>She kept her tongue flat as Rio rolled her hips against her mouth, taking an opportunity to glance up at Rio.</p><p>Agatha gripped Rio’s hips, stilling her as she let her tongue travel down further, teasing Rio’s entrance with the tip of her tongue before plunging into her. Rio’s hips bucked forward.</p><p>“God, Agatha!” Rio babbled.</p><p>Agatha continued fucking her with her tongue, widening and curling it, while her nose swiped against her clit. Rio reached down to pull Agatha closer to her, but she paused, thinking better of it. To her relief, Agatha grabbed her hand and brought it back to her head.</p><p>Rio felt her orgasm building as her thighs started to tremble around Agatha’s head. Agatha returned her attention to Rio’s clit, making fast circles with the tip of her tongue before sucking it into her mouth.</p><p>Rio tried to keep her hips still, as a flurry of “fuck” and “baby” and “faster” slipped past her lips.</p><p>Agatha brought two fingers up underneath her chin and entered Rio swiftly as she sucked her clit. She felt Rio shatter.</p><p>Rio felt her cunt fluttering around Agatha’s fingers. Her thighs clamped tightly around her head.</p><p>Rio thought she blacked out. Every muscle in her body tightened, and she tugged Agatha’s hair sharply, trying to get her as close to her core as possible.</p><p>Agatha continued to give her clit soft slow licks as her body began to relax—Rio, overstimulated, eventually pushed her away and dragged her up from the floor to lay on top of her.</p><p>Sweaty and spent, Agatha looked up at Rio from her place on her chest. Rio bent down to kiss her, soft and slow, tasting her orgasm on Agatha’s lips.</p><p>The two continued kissing until Rio’s stomach let out a low growl. Rio laughed against Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“So, dinner?” Rio looked at Agatha.  </p><p>“Yes, baby, we can have dinner now.” Agatha laughed and pulled Rio up from the couch.</p>

<p>Things were going well. Like, really well.</p><p>More often than not, Rio would wake up in Agatha’s bed or vice versa. Typically, Agatha’s though. She insists on a nightly ten-step skincare routine involving moisturizers, snail mucin, and all kinds of lotions and potions that Rio can’t even afford to think about. But it worked—the woman certainly had it going on.</p><p>They were on two entirely different morning schedules.</p><p>Usually, Rio wakes to Agatha’s head tucked under her chin, her long, wavy hair splayed across Rio’s chest and pillow. Rio’s arms wrapped tightly around Agatha, and not necessarily because she’s a big cuddler, but more so, not to fall off the bed from the one inch of mattress she’s allowed by Agatha. A survival technique, if you will.</p><p>Agatha does this cute thing,<em> it’s not that cute,</em> where she sleeps diagonally across the bed and hogs all the blankets—clearly a woman who has luxuriated in not sharing a bed with a partner for many years.</p><p>Rio adores mornings. She pops out of bed like an overeager Golden Retriever, whereas Agatha is more of a pampered cat with an attitude problem—one wrong move and she’ll make it everyone’s issue.</p><p>Rio has learned to carefully slip out of bed in the mornings, and when she kisses her not-girlfriend before leaving for work, she’s often greeted with a grumpy grunt in return. She likes her so much.</p><p>On the Tuesdays when Agatha is working from home, Rio makes up excuses to run inside and give Agatha a quick kiss when they get to her stop. Alice has heard every excuse in the book at this point.</p><p>
<em>“Be back!” Rio yells. “Gotta give the dog some water.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“She doesn’t even have a dog!” Alice yells back, rolling her eyes. “We’ve been through this.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>A few minutes passed with Alice tapping her fingers on the steering wheel impatiently.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Sorry, Al.” Rio returns to the truck looking loved up with lipstick stains on her collar. “The dog was really thirsty today.”</em>
</p><p>It’s rare that they don’t spend their evenings together.</p><p>Sometimes, with Agatha curled up in Rio’s front porch swing with a good book while Rio gardens. Agatha hasn’t admitted it out loud, but she loves watching Rio garden.</p><p>Rio has caught Agatha checking her out more than a few times, and being the good host she is, she always puts on a show. Sometimes she’ll move heavy rocks for no reason other than getting Agatha to watch her muscles flex. She’ll drop garden tools to give Agatha a little bend and snap action.</p><p>Other times she’ll whip off her t-shirt, clad in just her sports bra and shorts, and say stupid shit like “it’s a hot one today” or “how about this weather we’re having.”</p><p>She knows Agatha deducts points for her dad lingo, but Rio can’t help herself—it’s ingrained in her personality at this point.</p><p>But her favorite, on particularly hot days, is to grab the garden hose and run the water down her neck and back. Rio can see Agatha’s pupils blow from her spot in the front yard, and it almost always ends with Agatha yanking her down into her lap for a quick makeout session.</p><p>Other nights, they’ll end up at Agatha’s with Rio annoying her while she cooks dinner. Stealing chopped vegetables while she sits on the kitchen counter yapping about one thing or another.</p><p>On the days when Agatha is still catching up with work, Rio will cook dinner, bringing in spoonfuls of food for Agatha to taste test.</p><p>But their favorite way to end the day is curled up together on the couch, filling in each other about their days. Agatha venting her frustrations about whatever case she’s working on, and Rio usually catching her up on stupid shenanigans that she and Alice got into. Sometimes, with Agatha lying on Rio’s chest, her fingers softly stroking through Agatha’s hair. Or with Rio straddling Agatha’s lap as she animatedly talks with her hands. Just enjoying the company and hearing the other’s voice.</p><p>And the sex? Forget about it. Rio’s pretty sure she’s had more orgasms in these past four months than she has had in her entire life.</p><p>There wasn’t a surface in either of their homes that hadn’t been christened. The kitchen counter, the dining room table, bent over the porch railing, the washer, and also the dryer.</p><p>The gals had been busy.</p><p>Agatha was still reluctant to give up much control, but Rio was fine with that. She was more than happy to be at Agatha’s mercy, following her orders, letting her take what she needed.</p><p>There was even an unfortunate incident involving Mrs. Davis and a very topless Agatha on top of a very topless Rio in the front seat of Agatha’s car in her driveway. While Agatha was very amused, Rio still had trouble making eye contact with Mrs. Davis.</p><p>So yeah, things were going great. Until they weren’t.</p><p> </p><p>Rio and Agatha never go a full day without talking. Of course, there are busy days where communication is few and far between, but they always discuss that beforehand as a courtesy to the other. Agatha has never just ghosted Rio.</p><p>So, on Monday evening, when Rio gets home, checks her phone, and realizes she hasn’t heard from Agatha all day, she gets a little worried.</p><p>Rio glances out her window and sees that Agatha’s car is in her driveway and clearly home. She decides to give her a call, which rings for a while before going to voicemail.</p><p>Figuring she might still be busy with work, Rio shoots her a text.</p><p><em>Rio: </em>Hey, babe, haven’t heard from you all day. Everything okay?</p><p>Rio sets her phone aside and starts cooking dinner. She eats, does the dishes, and cleans the kitchen before checking her phone. Still nothing from Agatha, which makes her heart hurt a little.</p><p>She showers, folds some laundry, and gets ready for bed before once again checking her phone. Still nothing.</p><p>Rio tries to convince herself that Agatha just had a busy day, but it doesn’t stop her brain from going into overdrive, analyzing everything she might have done or said to upset Agatha.</p><p>
<em>Am I spending too much time with her?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Does she need some space?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Is it too much, too fast?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Am I too much?</em>
</p><p>Rio can’t shut her brain off, so she does what any sane person does when their not-girlfriend is hypothetically upset with them—she makes a list of everything she could have possibly recently done that would have pissed Agatha off.</p><p> </p><p>A few sleepless hours later, and a phone call to work feigning food poisoning, Rio is on Agatha’s front porch armed with only a piece of notebook paper, ready to fix this mess.</p><p>Agatha’s car is still in the driveway, and the lights are on, so Rio assumes she’s home. She knocks a few times to no avail.</p><p>“Agatha, I know you’re in there,” an exasperated Rio sighs into the door. “I swear to god, I’ll send over Mrs. Davis to check on you.”</p><p>Threats worked.</p><p>“We can sign you up for Life Alert,” Rio continued to goad her. “You’re practically AARP eligible. We might be able to get a discount.”</p><p>Rio heard the floorboards creak behind the door. Agatha didn’t open it, but Rio knew she was there. Progress.</p><p>“Look, I don’t know if I did something to upset you.” Rio slid down and sat on the porch with her back against the door. “But I made a whole list of potential reasons, and I’m going to read all of them to you. You tell me which one it is, and I promise never to do it again.”</p><p>“Number one: I dressed up as Oscar the Grouch, hid behind your trash can, and scared you,” Rio began.</p><p>Rio kept an Oscar suit on deck for the mornings when they were collecting at the same time kids were getting on the bus. It killed.</p><p>Hearing nothing, Rio continued.</p><p>“Number two: I Mario skipped to your sex drawer the one time when you told me to grab the strap.”</p><p>To be fair, Rio was just very excited. The spirit overcame her.</p><p>Still hearing silence, Rio read the next one.</p><p>“Number three: I had your partial sun bushes replaced with full sun bushes while you were out of town for work.”</p><p>Rio heard a shuffle behind the door. A lock clicked, and Rio tumbled into the doorway at Agatha’s feet.</p><p>“You did what?” Agatha asked incredulously.</p><p>“Look, they’re practically identical,” Rio stood from the floor, dusting herself off. “You would have never noticed if I hadn’t—”</p><p>Rio’s sentence trailed off when she looked at Agatha. Her eyes were red and swollen. Hair messier than usual. She looked like she hadn’t slept in days.</p><p>“Baby,” Rio opened her arms and stepped toward Agatha.</p><p>Agatha hesitated only for a minute before collapsing into Rio. She clutched at her like she might lose her, and Rio held her back just as tightly.</p><p>Sobs wracked Agatha’s body, and Rio felt her heart physically ache at the sight of Agatha in pain.</p><p>Rio was terrified. She had no idea what was wrong or how to fix it. Half of Rio’s genetic makeup was problem-solving. But there was no easy solution for this—no funny quip or correct combination of words.</p><p>Rio calmly walked them over to the couch, pulling Agatha down on top of her and grabbing a blanket to wrap around them. Agatha was still holding Rio like her life depended on it, silently crying into her chest.</p><p>And Rio was honest. “Agatha, you don’t have to tell me what’s going on, you don’t even have to talk to me, but I’m going to be right here—I need to be here.”</p><p>She felt Agatha nod weakly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t sure how long she held Agatha and stroked her hair, but eventually the bright sun shining through the living room windows dulled to a warm glow. Agatha’s breathing had slowed, and she eventually slipped into some much-needed sleep.</p><p>Rio carefully maneuvered herself out from under Agatha, the left side of her body tingling from falling asleep. As she stretched, she looked around at Agatha’s normally very tidy home, which was now in disarray. Open case files filled most of the table space, and the occasional takeout container was scattered across the kitchen.</p><p>Quietly, Rio got to work straightening up and making dinner. She opted for a pot of chicken noodle soup. It was hard to say the last time Agatha had a decent meal.</p><p>Rio made a cup of tea for herself and sat at the dining room table when she heard Agatha start to stir. She stood slowly with the blanket still wrapped around her and made her way to Rio, settling into her lap.</p><p>Rio held her for a minute and kissed the top of her head. “I made us some soup. Are you hungry?”</p><p>Agatha nods again, still not speaking.</p><p>Rio grabs two bowls from the kitchen before making her way back to Agatha. They eat in silence. Agatha now sitting across from Rio, holding her hand.</p><p>“We don’t have to talk about it, but I’d really like it if you did,” Rio said softly.</p><p>Agatha’s sad eyes finally made contact with Rios. “There’s a cardboard box in the hallway with an 'N' on it. Go grab it, please.”</p><p>Rio stood, a little confused, but grabbed the box and returned to the table.</p><p>“Open it.”</p><p>A small stuffed dinosaur’s head was peeking out of the top of the box. It was surrounded by choir achievement certificates, a stuffed rabbit, report cards, and drawings that Rio assumed were of Agatha and a small child—the artist.</p><p>“I had a son, Nicky—Nicholas,” Agatha finally spoke.</p><p>Rio pulled out a photo album and reached for Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“I’d always wanted a child,” Agatha started. “But by the time my life slowed down enough for me to even consider a family, I was 30 and didn’t want to wait any longer.”</p><p>Agatha explained her IVF journey while Rio flipped through pictures of a gorgeous newborn Nicky, likely the day Agatha brought him home from the hospital. His nursery was painted a light green and surrounded by trees and dinosaurs. A bright bird mobile hung over his crib, and books lined his shelves. Rio knew he’d never want for anything in his life.</p><p>“He saved me,” Agatha continued. “I don’t think I really knew what life or love was until I held him. And I was so scared of messing up. I wanted him to have everything I never had. We did everything together.”</p><p>And from the pictures alone, Rio knew Agatha had given him the best life she possibly could. The photos told stories of all their adventures together. Beach vacations where Agatha built sandcastles as tall as Nicky. Trips to the zoo where Nicky’s jaw dropped at the size of a giraffe. Quiet Sunday morning couch cuddle selfies.</p><p>Agatha smiled softly at the memories. “He loved animals. All kinds. It didn’t matter if they had four legs or hundreds of them.”</p><p>“He had an amazing green thumb for a child,” Agatha continued. “He was the only reason a plant could stay alive in our house.”</p><p>“And his voice, Rio, you wouldn’t believe it,” Agatha smiled, reliving a memory. “He loved music more than any kid I’ve ever met. Our weekly tradition was hunting down a new record store.” She paused. “You would have loved him.”</p><p>Rio felt her heart break, tears welling up because she knew what was coming.</p><p>“When he was about five-and-a-half, he started getting these headaches, and he was tired all the time.” Agatha’s eyes got distant, so Rio pulled her in closer. “We caught the tumor early, but it was aggressive.”</p><p>“The chemo really wore him down,” Agatha continued. “He had next to no appetite, so we had to get creative with meal times. Dino nuggets were a lifesaver. I still have them every once in a while.”</p><p>Rio thought back dino nugget box she found in Agatha’s trash and hugged her tighter.</p><p>“I did everything I could, Rio,” Agatha said through tears. “He had the best doctors, the best treatment options, but it just wasn’t enough. It only bought us an extra year. He would have been 12 today.”</p><p>Rio flipped through the pictures of when Nicky had been admitted to the hospital. Agatha made every effort she could to make it feel homey for him. Two life-size, stuffed dinosaurs guarded the foot of his bed. And in the corner of his room sat a tiny turntable and some of his favorite records.</p><p>“There’s nothing I can say to make it better. I know that,” Rio said. “But I also know that you gave each other such a beautiful life. There’s never enough time. And it’s not fair.”</p><p>“I was so angry for so long.” Agatha laid her head against Rio’s chest. “I had been alone my whole life, and then all of a sudden, there’s this little person I can’t live without. Then he’s gone.” She paused. “And now I’m fucking up with you too.”</p><p>“Hey, you’re not fucking anything up,” Rio grabbed Agatha’s chin gently, forcing her to make eye contact.</p><p>“I can’t even get sad without shutting you out, Rio. I’m so used to doing it alone, or things being taken from me. I don’t know how to depend on someone else. It’s easier not to. I don’t know how to do this.” Agatha pointed between her and Rio. “I just, I don’t know, I feel broken.”</p><p>And there it was. Finally, a glimpse at the Agatha she so carefully hid from the world. Rio sat Agatha in the dining room chair, and slid to the floor between her legs.</p><p>“You’ve never been broken, Agatha,” Rio said, looking up at her. “You’re not something to fix. You’re a gorgeous human being with all the trauma and flaws that come with it. I’m just here to exist with you and make life a little easier where I can.”</p><p>Rio leaned up to kiss the tears from Agatha’s cheeks.</p><p>“God, where did I find you?”</p><p>“Just digging through your trash, baby. Like a little pest.” Rio said, making Agatha crack a genuine smile for the first time today.</p><p> </p><p>After the two had gone through Nicky’s box of things and carefully packed them away, Rio drew them a bath and led them upstairs.</p><p>She slowly slid Agatha’s sweatshirt up and over her head, placing gentle kisses on her neck and collarbones. Rio dropped to her knees and tugged Agatha’s sweatpants down, placing those same gentle kisses across her thighs and stomach before walking her over to the tub.</p><p>She lowered Agatha into the water before climbing in behind her. Agatha relaxed her back against Rio’s chest, sighing contentedly.</p><p>While Rio massaged her neck and shoulders, Agatha told her about the time she convinced Nicky that the only way they could get to the top of the Empire State Building was to climb the stairs.</p><p>She also told him that broccoli was just tiny trees, and those were what dinosaurs ate, so if he wanted to get big and strong, he had to eat his broccoli.</p><p>“I bet you were a menace,” Rio smiled.</p><p>Agatha recounted the first time Nicky saw the Christmas tree lighting at Rockefeller Center while Rio washed her hair. Nicky was convinced it was the biggest tree in the world, so Agatha surprised him with a trip to Sequoia National Park, and it blew his mind.</p><p>Rio loved listening to the way Agatha spoke about Nicky. She knew without a doubt, Agatha was the best mom. And while her heart ached for her, she was so glad they had those memories together—memories she was willing to share with Rio.</p><p>Eventually, the water cooled, and they got out and dressed for bed. Agatha snuggled into Rio, her body half draped across her, the weight of the day finally settling in.</p><p>“I don’t think there’s anyone in the world I’d rather share this part of me with than you, Rio,” Agatha said softly.</p><p>Rio leaned down and kissed her head. “I’m here for as long as you’ll have me.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio lay awake for a long time that night. Long after Agatha had tucked into Rio’s side, face pressed into her neck with one hand up her shirt so she could stroke Rio’s ribs—that had become a comfort mechanism for Agatha as of late.</p><p>She continued to stare at the ceiling as Agatha changed positions throughout the night. On her stomach, star fishing, draped across Rio again, eventually settling for her back pressed into Rio’s chest while she let out the softest snores. Rio would never tell her that, though.</p><p>Rio’s brain would not shut down. She took in every detail Agatha had felt comfortable enough to share with her tonight, and replayed it in her head.</p><p>It felt like a significant step forward in their relationship, something Rio maybe hadn’t realized she’d been aching for.</p><p>The casual thing was fine. But Rio would have asked Agatha to be her girlfriend after their first date. She was big on gut feelings. She tended to treat Agatha like a timid horse, and she was absolutely terrified that one wrong move would scare her off.</p><p>And it’s not like they weren’t already acting like a couple. They did everything together, practically lived at one another’s house, and made sure to schedule cute date nights at least once every two weeks. Went to the damn farmer’s market together with their ridiculously cute matching tote bags for godsakes.</p><p>But this gnawing feeling of wanting to make things “official” wouldn’t leave Rio alone. And it’s not even that she’s particularly territorial. Agatha isn’t a prize for her to show off. It’s more of a commitment to Rio.</p><p>They don’t even have to tell the world, as long as Rio knows it’s real.</p><p>Rio sighs and glances at her phone resting on Agatha’s nightstand. The illuminated numbers read 5:30 a.m., which means Agatha’s alarm will go off soon, and they’ll both have to face the real world.</p><p>Rio wraps her arms tighter around Agatha, pulling her in and nuzzling her face into the back of her head, breathing in the smell of her floral shampoo.  </p><p>Agatha had been sleeping like the dead, which was why Rio was startled when she felt Agatha press back into her.</p><p>
<em>Probably just getting comfortable. </em>
</p><p>Rio felt it again—less subtle this time. Agatha’s ass was now flush against her crotch.  </p><p><em>Surely a mistake. </em>Rio wasn’t taking the bait.</p><p>This time, Agatha gave a full rotation of her hips pressing her ass against Rio’s front, and finally Rio’s sleep deprived brain grabbed Agatha’s hips and pulled her closer into her.</p><p>“Finally,” a sleepy-voiced Agatha grumbled.</p><p>Rio was an equal opportunity appreciator of women and their bodies. She didn’t have one favorite part. But gun to her head, Rio Vidal was a certified ass girl. And Agatha’s ass drove her insane.</p><p>If Agatha didn’t already know Rio was a pervert, the number of times she caught Rio staring at hers might have been a problem.</p><p>“Well, excuse me for keeping my hands to myself for once and letting you sleep,” Rio grumbled.</p><p>Agatha scoffed and continued to grind against Rio. Rio’s left arm was now resting under Agatha’s head while her right was wrapped around Agatha’s hip, fingers digging into her flesh as she slowly started to thrust against Agatha.</p><p>“I’m starting to think you might be obsessed with my ass.” Agatha continued her slow, torturous assault on Rio.</p><p>“Obsessed isn’t a strong enough word,” Rio moaned in Agatha’s ear. “If you sent me a picture of it, I’d set it as my phone background, my work computer background. I’d buy an expensive frame and hang it in my living room. I’d hire a sculptor to make a statue. I’d have a skywriter paint a mural in the clouds. If I were a soldier going off to war, I’d tuck it in my hat for safekeep—.”</p><p>Agatha spun around in Rio’s arms. Rolling her eyes, she cut her off with a filthy kiss. Tongue immediately thrusting into Rio’s mouth. Morning breath be damned.</p><p>“You kids and your nudes,” Agatha muttered into Rio’s lips. “Nothing gets erased from the internet. The cloud should literally be your worst nightmare.”</p><p>“The cloud should be your worst nightmare,” Rio mimicked Agatha. She grabbed her by the hips and pulled her on top of her.</p><p>Agatha glared at her, but leaned down to capture her lips again. Rio’s hands traveled down her sides and under her t-shirt, tightly gripping her hips. Agatha slipped a leg between Rio’s sleep-warmed thighs and slowly pressed against Rio’s core, rocking gently.</p><p>“God, baby, can you wake me up like this every day?” Rio groaned, her hands guiding Agatha.</p><p>Agatha smirked against her lips before starting a path of kisses down her neck and chest. She pushed Rio’s shirt up so it settled just above her breasts, giving them some attention, lightly kissing her rapidly hardening nipples as she made her way down Rio’s stomach. She kissed and licked the light trail of hair that led to the top of Rio’s boxers.</p><p>Rio tucked her hands behind her head, watching Agatha’s every move, feeling like the luckiest person on planet Earth. Because what do you mean a gorgeous, brilliant lawyer was about to go down on her until she saw stars. And she hadn’t even had breakfast yet!</p><p>Agatha’s fingertips ghosted beneath the waistband of Rio’s boxers. She lowered her face, nuzzling into Rio’s stomach and pressing hot kisses against her hip bones. Rio felt herself thrust upwards toward Agatha’s face as she got more desperate.</p><p>The kisses eventually trailed over the top of Rio’s boxers, Agatha’s hot tongue and breath pressing against every spot Rio so desperately needed to be touched. Agatha hooked her fingers into the fabric and began pulling them down Rio’s legs when a blaring noise stopped them both.</p><p>Agatha’s alarm.</p><p>
<em>No, no, no. </em>
</p><p>Agatha pressed one more kiss to Rio’s stomach before rolling off of her, giving her an apologetic look.</p><p>“Baby, no!" Rio sounded a little panicky. “Call out or something. Use a sick day.”</p><p>“Sorry, law firm partners, I can’t help an underrepresented child navigate our failing judicial system because Rio would like to come,” Agatha mocked her, offering a half-assed impersonation.</p><p>“Yeah, tell them that!” Rio nodded furiously.</p><p>“No one has ever died from not having an orgasm, Rio,” Agatha smirked.</p><p>“And you’re willing to test that theory on me?” Rio was now fully pouting. “I could be a medical anomaly!”</p><p>“Mmm, yes.” Agatha wrapped a robe around herself, making her way into the hallway. “Be a good boy and come give me a kiss goodbye in like an hour.”</p><p>And Rio would because she was head over heels for this woman.</p><p>She listened to Agatha’s soft footfalls. The click of the bathroom and the twist of the taps as the shower started.</p><p>And that’s when it clicked for Rio.</p><p>She wanted to know everything about this woman. She wanted to be so immersed in her life that she knew exactly where she was in her morning routine based on sounds alone.</p><p>She wanted to know exactly how she liked her steak cooked and what sides she wanted to pair with it. She wanted to know what weird quirks she had when folding and putting away her laundry. She wanted to know what Agatha’s tell was when she wanted to leave a boring social situation.</p><p>She wanted it all, and that was fucking scary. But nothing worthwhile came without a risk.</p><p>She was going to do it. Rio Vidal was going to ask Agatha Harkness to be her girlfriend.</p><p> </p><p>Rio dutifully kissed Agatha before she left for work and sat down at the dining room table, coffee in hand, to plan how she was going to ask Agatha out.</p><p>If Rio did exactly what she wanted to do, she would hire a flash mob and miraculously appear in the middle of the throng of people with some lame ass <em>Love Actually </em>cue cards to ask her out. Or maybe one of those huge, tacky yard design displays. Agatha would hate it.</p><p>Rio knew her well enough to know that she would want something personal and only for them. No huge declaration, just something private that only they could remember.</p><p>She got to work. Throwing on some clothes and heading to the grocery store. She picked up the few items she needed for their meal before dropping them at Agatha’s house.</p><p>Rio walked to her own house, grabbing a wheelbarrow and heading to her backyard. Her lilac bushes were about to take a beating, but it would be worth it.</p><p>An hour and several apologies later, her lilac bushes were fully massacred, but the wheelbarrow was full of fragrant purple flowers.</p><p>“Rio!” A shrill voice called out from behind her.</p><p>
<em>Mrs. Davis. </em>
</p><p>“Hi, Mrs. Davis,” Rio offered a friendly wave.</p><p>“What have you been up to lately?” Mrs. Davis asked. “I feel like I haven’t seen you in forever.”</p><p>“Oh, you know, just work and keeping up with Agatha.”</p><p>“Do those flowers have anything to do with Agatha?” Mrs. Davis smiled and pointed to the wheelbarrow.</p><p>“Yeah, actually.” Rio beamed. “I’m going to ask her to be my girlfriend.”</p><p>“Based on the last time I caught you two together, I would have assumed you were already an item,” Mrs. Davis teased.</p><p>Rio blushed deeply.</p><p>“I’m kidding, dear.” Mrs. Davis patted her arm. “She’d be a fool to say anything but yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio made quick work of bundling the flowers, and soon there wasn’t a space in Agatha’s house that wasn’t covered in purple flowers.</p><p>Rummaging through Nicky’s box of things, Rio picked out her favorite picture of Nicky and Agatha. The two had been hiking and stopped to take a selfie with the mountains in the background. Nicky’s arms were spread wide, and Agatha had one arm protectively placed over his chest, both smiling widely at the camera. Rio put it in a frame and placed it above the fireplace.</p><p>She got dinner started, and it wasn’t until she finally stopped moving that the nerves kicked in.</p><p>
<em>What if Agatha said no?</em>
</p><p>
<em>What if she wanted to keep things casual?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Would that make everything between them awkward?</em>
</p><p>Shaking the intrusive thoughts from her head, she looked down at her dirt-covered shirt and jeans and darted upstairs to shower before Agatha got home.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was pouring herself and Agatha a glass of wine when she heard Agatha’s keys in the front door.</p><p>“Rio, why is your wheelbarrow in the front yard?” Agatha asked as she hung up her keys. “I swear to god if you’re fucking with the bushes aga—.” She paused.</p><p>Rio peeked around the corner and watched with amusement as Agatha took in the flowers that had run rampant throughout her house.</p><p>“Hi, baby.” Rio walked up behind her, kissing her on the cheek.</p><p>“Rio, this is gorgeous, but what is all this?” Agatha eyed her inquisitively.</p><p>“I just wanted to do something special for you.” Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha’s waist, pressing a kiss to her neck. “Why don’t you go change into some comfy clothes while I get dinner ready?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was plating their dinner when she heard Agatha come down the stairs and take a seat at the dining room table.</p><p>She took a deep breath and picked up their plates.</p><p>“Now I’m no chef, but I think I did pretty alright,” she set the plate down in front of Agatha and looked at her cautiously.</p><p>Parents always tell you not to play with your food, but fortunately for Rio, she was never much of a rule follower. Before Agatha was a carefully created <em>Jurassic Park</em> scene, recreated entirely with food.</p><p>A path was carved into some mashed potatoes to make way for a gravy creek. Dino nuggets carefully stood outside the creek, accompanied by broccoli trees.</p><p>Rio watched Agatha’s face closely. Her eyes began to get watery, but a small smile started to tug at the corner of her lip.</p><p>“I hope I’m not overstepping,” Rio began as she reached for Agatha’s hand. “I just— last night meant a lot to me. And I want Nicky to be a part of our lives. I know you’ve dealt with this on your own, but you don’t have to do that anymore, if you want.”</p><p>Tears were now fully falling from Agatha’s eyes as Rio continued.</p><p>“I want you to talk to me on the good days, the bad days, the indifferent ones. I want to know everything. He is such an important part of you, so he’s important to me too. And, I—I’m not the best with words,” Rio faltered.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, giving Rio a tearful smile. “Rio, this means more than I could ever say. And he would have loved this. He would have loved you. The two of you together would have been little terrors, actually.”</p><p>“I’ve never had a support system,” Agatha gripped Rio’s hand tightly. “But I trust you, and I want to let you in. And I’m going to try my best to be open and honest.”</p><p>“That’s all I can ask for,” Rio smiled.</p><p>The two ate their meal and talked about their day. Agatha bitching about the traffic, and Rio telling her about the great lilac bush massacre of 2025. Dino nuggets paired surprisingly well with a Cabernet Sauvignon.</p><p>Everything felt easy and light, a welcome change of pace from the heaviness of the past two days.</p><p> </p><p>Rio began to clean up the kitchen and start the dishes when Agatha stopped her.</p><p>“You cooked, I’ll clean,” Agatha kissed Rio’s head and sent her into the living room.</p><p>Rio wandered over to Agatha and Nicky’s vinyl collection and began thumbing through the records.</p><p>Agatha watched Rio from the kitchen, still trying to wrap her head around how she got so lucky that this beautiful human fell into her life. The warm, late summer sun was beaming through the windows, glinting off the top of Rio’s dark hair, making it appear almost light brown.</p><p>Rio’s brow was furrowed in concentration, intent on selecting the perfect soundtrack for the evening. She landed on a Leon Bridges album, dropping the needle on “Coming Home,” before making her way back to Agatha in the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha was just finishing up the dishes. Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha, lightly humming along to the song.</p><p>“Dance with me?” Rio asked, spinning Agatha around.</p><p>Agatha’s arms locked around Rio’s neck, and Rio’s around her hips. The two swayed back and forth, grinning at each other, slightly tipsy from the wine.</p><p>The two danced through the kitchen, dining room, and eventually ended up in the living room, Agatha now with her head on Rio’s chest, Rio holding her tight. They didn’t stop swaying until the needle reached the end of the record grooves, offering a slight static hiss before the needle returned, clicking into place.</p><p>Agatha raised her head from Rio, eyes locking on the new photo addition above her fireplace. Rio followed her eyes.</p><p>“It’s my favorite one of you two,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha pulled her down into a kiss, soft and slow, not demanding anything. Rio’s mind flashed back to that night on her lawn at 3 a.m. Her hands nervously clutching a lightsaber as she word vomited out a date request to Agatha.</p><p>She felt like an out-of-her-league idiot at the time. And to be fair, she was still very much out of her league, but as she held this amazing woman in her arms, she knew she didn’t belong anywhere else.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio paused the kiss, hands resting on either side of Agatha’s cheeks. “I feel like I’m going to go crazy if I don’t ask you this. And I know labels are dumb, and it already feels like we’re together, but” Rio continued to ramble.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha says abruptly.</p><p>“You don’t even know what I was going to ask,” Rio quipped, mouth breaking into a full grin.</p><p>“Well, I was going to die of old age before you got it out,” Agatha joked. “And I didn’t want to stop kissing you.”</p><p>This time, the urge to <em>Breakfast Club</em> fist pump won out. “I’m dating the hottest lawyer in the world!” Rio shouted, arm still raised.</p><p>“You’re going to wake the whole neighborhood,” Agatha laughed.</p><p>“Baby, I’ll go knock on all of their doors and let them know personally.”</p><p>Agatha wrapped her hands around Rio’s head, pulling her down into another kiss—more heated this time, her teeth pulling at Rio’s bottom lip.</p><p>Rio leaned down, putting her hands around the back of Agatha’s thighs, lifting her and encouraging her to wrap her legs around her waist. She loved a chance to show Agatha how strong she was.</p><p>Rio pushed them against the living room wall, their lips never disconnecting, tongues exploring each other’s mouths while small pants and moans escaped.</p><p>Agatha pulled back only for a moment, lips swollen and pupils blown, “Take me to bed, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t let Agatha’s feet touch the ground until they reached her bedroom. Both of their hands tugging at each other’s clothes, trying to get as close as possible, as Rio backed them up to the bed.</p><p>Agatha reached for the hem of Rio’s shirt, trying to tug it over her head when Rio’s hands covered hers, halting the action.</p><p>Agatha looked at her slightly confused.</p><p>“Can I take care of you tonight?” Rio asked softly, bringing Agatha’s hand to her lips and gently kissing her fingertips.</p><p>This was still a hurdle they hadn’t overcome. And maybe hurdle wasn’t the correct word. Agatha liked control in the bedroom, and Rio was more than happy to give it to her. But she was dying for an opportunity to make Agatha’s pleasure her sole focus, to show her what she meant to her physically.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha looked at Rio, eyes full of trust.</p><p>“Thank you, baby,” Rio gave her a deep kiss, hoping to convey how much Agatha’s trust meant to her.</p><p>Rio slowly worked her hands under Agatha’s crewneck, lifting it over her head and tossing it to the side. Agatha had foregone a bra and now stood bare from the waist up in front of Rio. And Rio didn’t care how many times she saw this woman naked, it would always take her breath away.</p><p>She pulled Agatha against her, kissing her neck and chest before dropping to her knees in front of Agatha. She buried her face into Agatha’s stomach, relishing the feel of her impossibly soft skin against her face.</p><p>Rio hooked her fingers into Agatha’s sweatpants, slowly pulling them down her long legs, until she was clad only in some black lace underwear. She wrapped her hands around Agatha’s ass, fingers digging into the soft flesh, as she pulled Agatha’s cunt to her face. Her nose grinding against her clit as she breathed in Agatha’s arousal.</p><p>Agatha let a small whimper as Rio’s tongue explored her still clothed pussy. The wet, hot muscle pushing her clit side to side before dipping down and pressing inside her. The taste made Rio want to take her immediately, but tonight was about Agatha.  </p><p>Rio’s hands slid up to remove the final article of clothing. Rio looked up at Agatha, making eye contact from her place on the floor, on her knees between her legs. She looked at Agatha like she was something holy because she was.</p><p>Rio knelt close to the floor and started her trail of kisses at Agatha’s feet. She kissed her ankles, and shins, her knees, and the front of her thighs. Agatha’s hand reached down and tangled in Rio’s hair as she got closer to where she needed her.</p><p>“Baby,” Agatha moaned, pulling her closer and thrusting her hips.</p><p>Rio smiled, delighted at the effect she had on Agatha’s body, the goosebumps forming on her thighs. Rio leaned in, kissing and nipping at her hips, before kissing the neatly trimmed hair between her thighs.</p><p>Still on her knees, Rio brought up one hand to lightly swipe through Agatha’s arousal, both moaning at how wet she already was.</p><p>“Fuck, baby,” Rio groaned.</p><p>Rio spread her pussy with two fingers and let the tip of her tongue lightly flick over Agatha’s clit, causing Agatha to sharply tug at her hair, grinding against her face.</p><p>Rio pulled away and stood up, smirking at Agatha’s apparent frustration.</p><p>“Patience, pretty girl,” Rio offered a wicked grin as she pulled her own shirt over her head.</p><p>Once Rio was clad in only her sports bra and boxers, she sauntered back over to Agatha, grabbing her hips roughly and lowering her onto the bed. Agatha pulled Rio on top of her. Rio’s hands settled on either side of her head, and she felt Agatha’s legs wrap around her hips.</p><p>Rio gave her one teasing grind of her hips against her cunt before standing to discard the rest of her clothes. Agatha propped herself up on her forearms to enjoy the show.</p><p>Rio watched in enjoyment as Agatha’s eyes widened at her hard nipples, and how Agatha bit her bottom lip when she glanced down at the damp hair at the apex of Rio’s thighs, so aroused just from bringing Agatha pleasure.</p><p>“Do you like what you see?” Rio teased, hamming it up and giving her a spin.</p><p>“You know I do, now will you please come do something about it?” Agatha groaned and let her head fall back against the pillows.</p><p>Rio walked over to their sex drawer, grabbing a harness, the lavender strap that sent her into a spiral for a week, and a small bottle of lube before returning to the bed.</p><p>She crawled over Agatha slowly, slotting a firm thigh in between her legs, which Agatha eagerly began grinding on. Rio felt her slick coating her skin as Agatha’s mouth parted to let out another moan.</p><p>Rio rolled her hips in time with Agatha’s thrusts, giving her the pressure she was silently begging for. She pressed hot, open-mouthed kisses against her neck before traveling lower and taking her nipples into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha’s chest pushed upward to meet Rio’s mouth as she sucked on her left nipple as it pebbled in her mouth, and roughly kneaded her right breast in her hand. Agatha’s hand was tangled tightly in Rio’s hair, encouraging her to go down lower.</p><p>Rio kissed the valley between Agatha’s breasts and her stomach before leaning up on her knees between Agatha’s legs.</p><p>Rio placed her hands on Agatha’s inner thighs, pushing them apart so Agatha was completely spread out for her. Her arousal coated her lips and pubic hair.</p><p>“God, you are so beautiful,” Rio looked at her reverently.</p><p>Agatha was flushed, and her breath came out in small pants. “Rio, I’m a patient woman, and I don’t beg, but I will ask nicely, please fuck me.” Her hips canted toward Rio.</p><p>Rio didn’t have the restraint to make her wait anymore. She dove in, flattening her tongue and giving Agatha one broad lick from her entrance to her clit—collecting as much cum in her mouth as she could before swallowing it down. She would never get tired of Agatha’s taste.</p><p>“God!” Agatha yelped as her hips jumped.</p><p>Rio let the tip of her tongue make tight circles around Agatha’s clit, slowly warming her up before flattening her tongue and running it back and forth.</p><p>Agatha’s hand gripped her hair tightly and tugged her where she wanted her. Kind of like a <em>Ratatouille </em>situation, but sexual. That was weird. Rio filed that away as something not to bring up during sex.</p><p>She dragged her tongue slowly down to Agatha’s entrance, teasing and dipping into her with the tip. Rio wrapped her arms around her hips, holding her down, before plunging her long tongue inside completely.</p><p>“Fuck, baby!” Agatha moaned.</p><p>Rio continued to fuck her with her tongue, alternating between slow and fast and rubbing her nose against her clit. She didn’t want Agatha to come just yet, but she wanted her to be right on the edge.</p><p>When she heard Agatha’s breaths coming in shorter pants, and she felt her pussy start to flutter around her tongue, Rio pulled back.</p><p>Agatha whined in protest, but stopped when she realized Rio was pulling on the harness.</p><p>She settled the straps comfortably on her thighs before putting the dildo in place. Grabbing the bottle of lube Rio squirted some in her hand and made a show of slowly stroking the silicone cock.</p><p>Agatha whined and spread her legs wider, her pussy pink and glistening. Rio settled in between her thighs.</p><p>“Only one rule,” Rio said as she grasped the cock, sliding it between Agatha’s folds. “I want eye contact the whole time. I want—need to see you fall apart.”</p><p>Agatha nodded furiously, willing to do anything to have Rio inside her immediately.</p><p>Rio lined up with Agatha’s entrance, slowly sliding into her. Agatha’s eyes were locked on Rio, but began to roll back in her head as Rio slid in deeper.</p><p>“Oh, Rio,” Agatha moaned, her back arching.</p><p>“Look at me, baby,” Rio gave her a gentle reminder as she bottomed out in Agatha.</p><p>Rio placed her forearms on either side of Agatha’s head as she leaned in to give her a filthy kiss, giving Agatha time to adjust to the stretch. Slowly, she began to roll her hips, seeking out that spot inside Agatha that would make her see stars.</p><p>“Fuck, baby right there,” Agatha whined, pulling Rio in deeper.</p><p>
<em>Bingo. </em>
</p><p>Rio started slow, pulling out halfway before thrusting back in. She started a steady rhythm, using Agatha’s moans as feedback.</p><p>The strap was stroking against her clit perfectly, working her up as she continued to fuck Agatha.</p><p>“Harder, baby, please,” Agatha moaned, wrapping her legs around Rio’s hips, pulling her in closer.  </p><p>Rio was all too happy to oblige. Pulling out fully, she slammed back into Agatha, setting a brutal pace that had high-pitched whines escaping Agatha’s lips.</p><p>Rio grasped the sheets behind Agatha’s head, her eyes desperate. She looked so fucking pretty like this, face flushed, a sheen of sweat covering her forehead, and her hair wild.</p><p>Their hips slapped together as Rio continued fucking her hard. Agatha was struggling to keep her eyes open.</p><p>Rio brought one hand between Agatha’s legs to rub small circles against her clit in time with her thrusts. Agatha’s eyes shot open, and her hips started to buck wildly.</p><p>“You’re close, aren’t you, baby?” Rio panted.</p><p>Agatha nodded furiously while clutching Rio’s back, her nails biting into the flesh.</p><p>Rio sped up her thrusts, thoroughly fucking Agatha into the mattress, but kept a steady rhythm going on her clit.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio I’m gonna come!” Agatha panted. “Don’t stop, don’t fucking stop!”</p><p>Agatha’s legs clamped around Rio, and her head flew back. Her eyes were wide as she looked at Rio, and her whole body went taut. Spasming after a few moments. Her mouth parted, and a feral groan escaped.</p><p>Rio was in awe and held her close as she came down. She slowed her strokes against Agatha’s clit as oversensitivity took over.</p><p>Rio buried her face in Agatha’s neck, smelling the scent of sweat and sex that clung to her skin. Agatha’s fingers began slowly stroking through Rio’s hair as both of their heartbeats struggled to go back to normal.</p><p>Rio picked up Agatha’s free hand, making Agatha give her a manual high five. Agatha laughed as Rio slowly rose, preparing to pull out of Agatha.</p><p>To her surprise, Agatha locked her legs back around Rio.</p><p>“Stay inside me, just a little longer,” Agatha requested quietly.</p><p>Rio lay back down on Agatha’s chest, listening to her heartbeat and grinning stupidly at the fact that this was her life.</p><p>The luckiest garbage collector in the world.</p>

<p>Rio was practically vibrating with excitement. Her phone read 3 a.m., which meant that her alarm would go off in an hour.</p><p>But that didn’t matter.</p><p>She had been up all night anyway, too excited to sleep, like a kid on Christmas Eve.</p><p>It was bring your girlfriend to work day, or at least that’s what Rio had deemed it. Once a year, the New Jersey Sanitation Department hosted a "Bring Your Family to Work Day." It was a nice social event where employees could give their families a tour of the plant so they would have a better idea of what they did during the day.</p><p>Rio’s family lived out of state, so it wasn’t really feasible for them, and it had taken a few weeks, but eventually Rio had convinced Agatha to go.</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>4 Weeks Away </strong>
</p><p>“I don’t know, Rio,” Agatha peeked over the top of her book. “It feels like a touch-a-truck kind of thing. Won’t there be a bunch of kids there?”</p><p>“I mean a few, yeah,” Rio shrugged.</p><p>“And you’ll be giving these kids a tour of your truck and showing them how it works?” Agatha pressed her tongue to the inside of her cheek as she continued to pester her.</p><p>“Yes, fine!” Rio threw her arms in the air. “We literally have an event that day called touch-a-truck.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Is it important to you that I go?”</p><p>“I mean,” Rio averted her eyes. “It’s whatever you want. It could be fun.”</p><p>Agatha eyed her down a little longer before returning to her book.</p><p>“Okay, Rio.”</p><p>
<strong>2 Weeks Away </strong>
</p><p>They were on dish duty. Agatha is washing and Rio drying and putting away.</p><p>“I think Alice’s nieces are coming, and Lilia’s sister is going to be there.” Rio dried off a plate and placed it in the cabinet.</p><p>“Well, that sounds like it will be a good time.” Agatha put the last fork in the dish drainer before wiping down the sink.</p><p>“Mhmmm.” Rio let out a dramatic sigh. “And I guess I’ll have no one. All alone. Just by myself.” She side-eyed Agatha to see if it was working.</p><p>Agatha wiped her hands off with a dish towel. “I’m sure Alice will share her nieces with you.”</p><p>She kissed Rio’s cheek and headed toward the living room.</p><p>
<strong>1 Week Away </strong>
</p><p>Rio was being good. If Agatha didn’t want to come to family day, she didn’t have to. Rio wasn’t going to beg, but she did have one more trick up her sleeve.</p><p>Agatha’s leg was draped over Rio’s shoulder, and her back was arched off the couch.</p><p>“Fuck, baby, please don’t stop,” Agatha groaned, thrusting her hips into Rio’s mouth.</p><p>Rio continued licking and sucking until Agatha’s hand tightened in her hair. When her breathing turned into short pants, Rio abruptly pulled back.</p><p>“Are you really not coming to family day? Rio asked, face glistening with Agatha.</p><p>Agatha looked down at her, face flushed, a little pissy, but also amused. “Rio, are you being serious right now?”</p><p>Rio looked up at Agatha from her spot on the floor. Her arms were crossed, and her lips were in a full pout.</p><p>“I was always going to come, babe.” Agatha leaned down to kiss the cute but grumpy look off of her girlfriend’s face. “I just like messing with you.”</p><p>Agatha knew how important this was to Rio. She wasn’t very good at hiding her emotions.</p><p>“Well, it was a bad joke.” Rio finally uncrossed her arms and kissed Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>“But—” Agatha paused, fisting her hand back into Rio’s hair. “I reserve the right to change my mind if you don’t get me off right now.”</p><p>Rio’s pout broke out into a wide grin, and she happily obliged.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” a sleepy voice, Agatha mumbled. “I can literally feel you shaking the bed. You’re like an annoying, tiny dog.”</p><p>Rio was too excited to come up with a clever comeback, opting instead to wrap her arms around her grumpy, one-hundred percent not a morning person, girlfriend.</p><p>“I can’t help it,” she buried her face into Agatha’s hair.</p><p>Agatha flipped onto her back and pulled Rio onto her chest. “I just need like five more minutes. Can you do that for me?”</p><p>Rio nodded obediently. And she really did try, but her twitching and huffing every few seconds wasn’t helping.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said with a warning tone and a sharp nudge.</p><p>“Sorry.” Rio stilled.</p><p>In the spirit of not being annoying, she began staring up at Agatha for what felt like a painfully long time.</p><p>“Are you staring at me?” Agatha questioned, eyes still closed.</p><p>“Yep,” Rio said, obnoxiously popping the “p.”</p><p>“Okay, new plan.” Agatha nudged Rio off of her. “You go downstairs and start getting ready, and I’ll be there in a little bit.”</p><p>“Can do!” Rio hopped out of bed and was halfway down the stairs before Agatha could even close her eyes.</p><p>Rio started working on their coffee orders. Plain, black, and hot for Agatha. <em>Psycho. </em>And cold brew with a splash of oat creamer for Rio.</p><p>She was closing the lid on her travel mug when she heard the clacking of Agatha’s heels on the stairs. Rio rolled her eyes. She had told Agatha many times that this was a casual event. She would literally be crawling in and out of a trash truck.</p><p>But Agatha was not a casual woman. Rio glanced at the bottom of the stairs where Agatha was standing, clad in fitted deep purple slacks, a white button-up, and no less than six-inch heels.</p><p>Rio laughed to herself as she approached Agatha, who was standing with one hand out, expecting coffee and replying to emails on her phone with the other. Rio grabbed her hand and kissed her knuckles.</p><p>“Cute, but I really need the coffee,” Agatha said, not looking up from her phone.</p><p>“Baby, you know that I know you look amazing, but you absolutely cannot be climbing on and off of a trash truck in six-inch heels.”</p><p>“The hell I can’t,” Agatha scoffed, still not looking up from her phone.</p><p>“OSHA wouldn’t approve,” Rio reasoned.</p><p>“Don’t even get me started on those guys,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>Rio stood there, arms crossed, staring down her favorite person and hoping for a compromise. Agatha stared right back, but eventually conceded with a dramatic huff and headed back upstairs to change.</p><p>Rio grinned, taking the win, and continued to pack their stuff for the day.</p><p>“Babe, we gotta head out in like five,” Rio shouted up the stairs.</p><p>She turned towards the front door when she heard the unmistakable clack of heels against hardwood, heavier, but still heels nonetheless—this<em> woman.</em></p><p>“I’m ready.” Agatha stopped at the bottom of the stairs, batting her lashes innocently at Rio.</p><p>Her “compromise” was fitted jeans, a loose-knit sweater, and boots with easily a five-inch heel.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whined. “I thought we agreed no heels.</p><p>“Mhm.” Agatha nodded. “And these are boots.”</p><p>
<em>Dating a lawyer was annoying. </em>
</p><p>“Yeah, heeled boots. Those are practically the same size as the other ones.”</p><p>“No, the other ones were six inches, and these are only five,” Agatha calmly explained.</p><p>“Oh, and what difference does an inch make?” Rio knew this was a losing battle.</p><p>A wicked grin spread across Agatha’s face like she had been waiting for Rio to ask that exact question.</p><p>“Oh, Rio.” Agatha stepped toward her, one hand raising toward Rio’s face to push her hair away from her ear and the other wrapping around her waist.</p><p>“An inch can make all the difference in the world if you know what you’re doing with it, right, pretty girl?” Agatha’s hot breath ghosted over Rio’s ear. Her other hand dropping from Rio’s waist to grab her ass and pull her against her thigh.</p><p>“Mmm, that’s no fair,” Rio groaned.</p><p>“You’re the one who is willingly dating a lawyer,” Agatha smirked and stepped back from Rio, seemingly unaffected. “Anywho, we better get a move on it, wouldn’t want to be late for family day.”</p><p>Rio, still slack-jawed, watched as Agatha grabbed her coffee and left out the front door. Still wearing heels.</p><p>
<em>Fuckin’ succubus woman. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Despite the early hour, the New Jersey Sanitation Department was popping. Food truck vendors were set up in the parking lot, serving breakfast along with booths from local businesses that had flyers to hand out and fun activities for the kids to do.</p><p>Rio parked the car, and she and Agatha walked about two feet when they heard two small voices shriek, “Rio!”</p><p>Rio whipped around just in time to brace herself for two small children to latch onto her legs—Alice’s nieces.</p><p>“I’m basically chopped liver when Rio is around,” Alice chuckled and extended her hand to Agatha. “Nice to formally meet you, Agatha.”</p><p>“After all the shenanigans you and your coworker have gotten up to at my house, you’re hardly a stranger.” Agatha shook her hand.</p><p>The two women laughed and looked over at Rio, who was now balancing a child on each foot while attempting to walk.</p><p>“Word on the street is there’s a balloon artist around here.” Rio glanced down at the new growths on her legs. “Should we go check them out?</p><p>Of course, this was met with a chorus of “Yeah!”</p><p>“I’ll be back in a minute, babe,” Rio said, looking at Agatha. “You and Alice should go grab some breakfast.”</p><p> </p><p>They settled on a bagel truck called “The Right Hole,” mostly for the name, and set up shop at a picnic table.</p><p>“Has she always been this good with kids?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“As long as I’ve known her,” Alice said, taking a bite of her bagel. “And my nieces are obsessed with her. Probably because she’s just a big kid.”</p><p>Agatha nodded in agreement, but she couldn’t deny that watching how good Rio was with kids was doing things to her.</p><p>“God, I gotta stop watching this,” Agatha mumbled. “I’m perimenopausal, but I’d let her get me pregnant.” She didn’t necessarily mean to say that last part out loud.</p><p>It’s a good thing Alice is a good sport.</p><p>Alice laughed. “You know, geriatric pregnancy actually has a lot of benefits.”</p><p>Agatha just stared, so Alice continued.</p><p>“Like, financially, you’re more secure and you’re emotionally more intelligent. You also have stronger support networks, and some studies show that women who have a child after 35 face a lower risk for birth defects.”</p><p>Agatha cocked her head and continued to stare at Rio’s odd but very smart friend. There was a bit of a pregnant pause, pun intended.</p><p>“You know,” Agatha began. “That was actually very informative.”</p><p>The two were so caught up in their conversation that they missed Rio and the kids returning.</p><p>“M’lady.” Rio presented Agatha with a balloon flower. “What are you guys talking about?</p><p>“Perimenopause—the benefits of a geriatric pregnancy,” both Alice and Agatha spoke at the same time.</p><p>Rio paused. “Odd breakfast conversation, but alright.”</p><p>She reached down and took a big bite out of Agatha’s bagel.</p><p>“Come on,” Rio said, reaching for Agatha. “Lilia is inside and wants to meet you.”</p><p>“Ooooohhhhhhh,” Alice mocked like an annoying school kid. And Rio just smirked.</p><p>“What?” Agatha questioned. “Is she scary or something?”</p><p>“Lilia can be— very intimidating,” Rio reasoned, locking eyes with Alice.</p><p>“Please,” Agatha scoffed. “You should know I do very well with parents and authority figures in general.”</p><p> </p><p>The crew made their way into the plant where Rio gave a brief tour, mostly showing Agatha all of the places where she and Alice had done stupid shit while Alice laughed and nodded along.</p><p>“And fun fact, the safety guard on the trash compactor 100 percent works.” Rio wrapped up her story. “They just don’t want you to know that.”</p><p>“Who doesn’t want you to know that?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“The man,” Rio responded while Alice shook her head in agreement.</p><p>Agatha stared at both of them, mouth agape. “It’s truly a wonder you both have lived this long.”</p><p>As if on cue, Lilia’s office door opened and she stepped out.</p><p>“Ah, you must be Agatha.”</p><p>“And you must be Lilia.”</p><p>The two were locked in the matriarchal stare down of the century. And if Rio was being honest, she was a little nervous.</p><p>“Wonderful, step into my office.” Lilia waved Agatha in.</p><p>Alice and Rio moved to follow, but Lilia held up her hand. “Ah, ah, just Agatha.”</p><p>They looked at each other nervously as the door clicked shut.</p><p>“What do you think she’s saying to her?” Alice asked.</p><p>“Well,” Rio got up on her high horse. “Lilia does see me as one of her own. She’s probably giving her the whole ‘you better not hurt her’ chat.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes. “Sure, champ.”</p><p>They distracted themselves with a game of “thrashketball,” lovingly named by Rio, and after what felt like hours, but was probably 20 minutes, Agatha and Lilia came out of the office laughing.</p><p>“Here, give me your number, and we’ll get together sometime next week,” Agatha said, handing Lilia her phone.</p><p>“Perfect, I know this little café you’re going to die for.”</p><p>Rio and Alice stared at each other, slack-jawed. Lilia never cut up with anyone. In fact, Rio wasn’t sure if she ever actually left the plant. The scrunched can they were playing with bounced in front of Lilia’s feet.</p><p>“You two, Frick and Frack,” Lilia said sternly. “Don’t you have a route to be on? And close your mouths, you look like fish.”</p><p>Agatha stood beside her, grinning smugly.</p><p>“Yes, ma’am,” Alice and Rio responded in unison, jaws snapping shut.</p><p>“And be careful with this one.” Lilia gestured to Agatha. “Precious cargo.”</p><p>Agatha sauntered up to Alice and Rio as annoying as humanly possible.</p><p>“You heard her,” Agatha quipped. “I’m precious cargo.”</p><p>Rio knew she was going to be insufferable for the rest of the day. Maybe even for the rest of their lives.</p><p> </p><p>Rio and Alice were getting suited up outside their truck. All employees wore the dark blue standard overalls with the NJSD insignia and a reflective vest.</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha steps toward Rio suggestively. “I love a woman in uniform.” Agatha ran her hands along the overalls' straps.</p><p>“You’ve seen me in this hundreds of times.” Rio smiled at her.</p><p>“Yeah, but it’s different in action.”</p><p>Alice poked her head out of the driver’s window. “Load up, freaks!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was impressed with how well Agatha was keeping up. And in heels no less.</p><p>Of course, she never gave her anything too heavy or too messy. After all, Agatha was still a pretty princess. She’s sure she even caught Agatha flashing a genuine smile when Rio let her ride on the back of the truck with her.</p><p>After a while, Agatha hopped up in the front of the truck to talk to Alice. They were collecting in a 60-and-up community, and Rio was making frequent visits.</p><p>“Does she always do this?” Agatha asked as she watched Rio dragging some trash cans back up the driveway after she emptied them.</p><p>“Oh yeah, that's Mrs. Crenshaw’s house. She’s 98 and lives on her own, so Rio helps out where she can.”</p><p>Agatha saw this trend repeat throughout the day. Whether it was Rio moving heavy trash for older clients, returning cans, or even just stopping for a short chat, even though it put them behind schedule.</p><p>“Oh, and about four times a year she’ll visit elementary schools to give presentations about the importance of recycling,” Alice piped up. “She does love recycling, but I’m pretty sure she just does it to wear the mascot outfit.</p><p>
<em>Mother goddamn Theresa. Wait, she might actually have been a piece of shit. Bad comparison. </em>
</p><p>“She really has a heart of gold, doesn’t she?” Agatha turned her attention back to Alice.</p><p>“She does,” Alice looked at her friend proudly. “And she is absolutely crazy about you.”</p><p>“Oh, is she now?” Agatha quipped. She knew Alice was being sincere, but she was having a hard time wrapping her head around it in the moment.</p><p>“Really, Agatha.” Alice turned to face her. “I’ve never heard her talk about someone like she does you.”</p><p>Agatha felt her heart surge at Alice’s words. She didn’t say it out loud, but she was absolutely crazy about her, too. Agatha was basically getting a personal presentation on how good Rio was, and she so desperately wanted to be good enough for Rio, too.  </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, the day wrapped up, the ladies returned to the plant, and Agatha said her goodbyes before she and Rio got in the car and headed home.</p><p>Rio could feel Agatha’s eyes drilling holes into her. Her fingers were making small circles in the hairs on the back of her neck.</p><p>“You’re usually not this touchy-feely, not that I’m complaining.” Rio reached over to grab Agatha’s thigh. “What’s going on?”</p><p>“Can’t I just love on my gorgeous, hard-working girlfriend?”</p><p>“Of course you can, but if you keep it up, I’m bringing you to work with me every day.”</p><p>And the affection didn’t stop once they got home. If anything, it ramped up.</p><p>Rio barely made it through Agatha’s doorway before Agatha had her pushed up against it. Agatha’s lips claimed Rio’s instantly, moving against her so hard it was almost bruising. Her tongue entered Rio’s mouth without permission, running against her teeth and across the roof of her mouth.</p><p>All Rio could do was moan and hold on for dear life.</p><p>“Jesus, Agatha.” Rio clutched her. “Is it the overalls? Because I’ll wear them every day for the rest of my life.”</p><p>Agatha slowed her kisses, making her way up Rio’s jaw before she reached her ear. “Rio, baby, I need you to do three things for me, do you think you can handle that?”</p><p>Rio nodded dumbly.</p><p>“Good girl, I need you to go upstairs, get naked, and get on the bed,” Agatha ordered.</p><p>And Rio didn’t have to be told twice. She practically tripped over her own feet on her mad dash.</p><p>Rio shed her last article of clothing before even entering their bedroom. She hopped in the shower for two seconds, dried off, and waited patiently on the bed.</p><p>Because she was Agatha’s good girl, thank you very much.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back on her forearms, spreading her legs slightly, and waited for Agatha, listening to her footfalls on the stairs.</p><p>As if summoned, Agatha appeared in the doorway. Her long, wavy locks swept up into a messy bun. She had swapped out her business casual attire for some baggy sweatpants and what looked to be a pair of Rio’s boxers peeking out from the waistband.</p><p>Rio loved Agatha in whatever she wore, but a slightly more masculine-dressed Agatha really got her going. Especially knowing that she spent all day in heels and fancy clothes being an absolute boss bitch. There was something special about knowing only Rio got to see her this way.</p><p>She was also wearing a t-shirt that looked like it read—hold on.</p><p>“How in the hell did you get a New Jersey Sanitation Department Crew shirt?” Rio asked incredulously.</p><p>“Oh, this old thing?” Agatha smirked and sauntered over to Rio. “Lilia was a doll and gave it to me today.”</p><p>“What the fuck?” Rio sat up. “She’s been telling me we were out of them for months.”</p><p>Agatha continued to smile. Clearly enjoying getting a rise out of her lover. “Rio, baby, is that really what you want to focus on right now?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes traveled slowly down Agatha’s body. She was still sporting that infuriating smirk, her jawline was set, and her nipples had hardened into stiff peaks beneath that goddamn shirt that Rio would be having a discussion with Lilia about.</p><p>Rio’s eyes continued their journey until they reached Agatha’s waist, and, oh. A large bulge restrained by Rio’s boxers was pressing against the front of Agatha’s sweatpants.</p><p>“Still care about the shirt?” Agatha asked smugly.</p><p>“Could not care less actually.” Rio reached forward to grab Agatha’s waist, but was stopped.</p><p>“Not so fast, baby.” Agatha secured Rio’s hand in hers and pressed it against the front of her sweatpants. “Feel me.”</p><p>Rio slid her hand up the length and groaned before stopping, and her eyes widened. “This, uh, feels bigger than the usual one.”</p><p>“Smart girl.” Agatha continued to rub Rio’s hand against her. “About an inch, I would say, since it’s not much of a difference according to you.”</p><p>
<em>This woman was about to turn a strap session into a life lesson. Rio might be in love. No, Rio was in love. </em>
</p><p>Agatha dropped to her knees in front of Rio, who was looking down at her in awe.</p><p>“It looks like you’re pretty excited for this extra inch.” Agatha ran a finger through Rio’s soaked folds.</p><p>Rio let a groan slip past her lips as she fell back on the bed and parted her legs farther, giving Agatha as much access as she needed.  </p><p>“You’re so fucking gorgeous.” Agatha planted soft kisses on Rio’s knees, her inner thighs, and hips until Rio was squirming.</p><p>All it took was one stroke of Agatha’s tongue through Rio for her hips to start bucking wildly, her hand reaching down to grasp Agatha’s hair. Her tongue tracing teasing circles around her clit before sliding down and plunging in and out of Rio.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha,” Rio whined and continued thrusting her hips that Agatha was trying and failing to hold in place.</p><p>Agatha got her whole face involved, tongue still fucking Rio while she moved her nose in small, tight circles against her clit.</p><p>“Baby, I’m gonna come if you keep doing that,” Rio groaned and pulled Agatha in closer.</p><p>“You’ll come when I say you can,” Agatha growled, and sunk two fingers into Rio.</p><p>Rio’s back arched off the bed, and she let out a scream that poor Mrs. Davis could probably hear.</p><p>Agatha curled and scissored her fingers inside of her before pulling out.</p><p>“You feel ready to me, baby.” Agatha stood in front of Rio, who was spread out and flushed, and looking at her with needy eyes. She looked so desperate and willing to be ruined, it was stunning.  </p><p>Agatha raised her arms to take off her shirt, but Rio quickly rose on her forearms.</p><p>“Wait! Can you leave it on?”</p><p>Agatha smirked at her. “You little freak.” But she, of course, obliged.</p><p>She slid her sweatpants down legs slowly, giving Rio a better look at the large silicone cock that was now clearly straining against her boxers.</p><p>Rio’s lips parted as she continued to stare.</p><p>Agatha shed the boxers, causing the cock to spring to action as she knelt on the bed and crawled toward Rio.</p><p>Rio spread her legs farther to make room for Agatha and looked at her with eyes full of trust and want.</p><p>“You’re going to take all of me, aren’t you, baby?” Agatha asked as she squirted some lube in her hand and stroked it up and down her length.</p><p>Rio watched in awe and nodded.</p><p>Agatha took Rio’s jaw in her hand. “That’s my good girl. I’ll be gentle, but I want you to feel every inch of me.” She put a flat hand on Rio’s chest and pushed her down onto the bed.</p><p>Agatha swiped her cock through Rio, using the tip to tease her clit.</p><p>“Agatha, please,” Rio whined.</p><p>Agatha lined herself up with Rio’s entrance, allowing the tip to just barely press in. She leaned forward, resting her forearms on either side of Rio’s head, and encouraged Rio to wrap her legs around her waist.</p><p>Rio was practically sobbing, trying to no avail to thrust her hips forward and take Agatha.</p><p>“Baby, wait.” Agatha made sure Rio made eye contact with her. “Tell me if it’s too much, okay?”</p><p>Rio’s pupils were blown, but she nodded furiously.</p><p>Agatha began to slowly slide into her inch by inch, watching for any signs of discomfort. Rio’s head immediately lolled to the side, her eyes rolling back in her head.</p><p>“Look at you.” Agatha encouraged. “You’re taking me so well.”</p><p>Agatha was almost buried to the hilt when she noticed Rio’s brow furrow, so she paused.</p><p>“Talk to me, baby.” Agatha leaned down to kiss Rio’s neck. “Can you take more?”</p><p>“Yes, please!” Rio moaned. “I can take it.”</p><p>“I need you to relax for me. Take a deep breath and spread farther.”</p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s legs drop open as she slid the last inch in and stilled, giving Rio time to adjust to the fullness.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha, you’re so big,” Rio groaned.</p><p>And this did wonders for Agatha’s already massive ego.</p><p>Agatha gave an experimental pump of her hips, causing Rio to gasp and lock her legs tighter around Agatha’s waist. She did this a few more times before deciding Rio was warmed up and started thrusting harder.</p><p>Rio was now babbling some incoherent words as Agatha began thrusting in earnest, their hips meeting. She snaked one hand down Rio’s body and began rubbing her clit.</p><p>“Harder, baby,” Rio begged, one hand lying flat against the headboard to keep her head from banging against it. “You’re so deep inside me.”</p><p>Agatha widened her stance and fucked Rio harder, her tits bouncing with each thrust, as Rio locked her legs around her even tighter.</p><p>“Fuck, baby right there. I’m gonna come.”</p><p>Agatha stilled her fingers on Rio’s clit. “ I said, you’ll come when I say you can.”</p><p>Rio whined.</p><p>Agatha changed their position, grabbing the top of the headboard for leverage and throwing Rio’s leg over her shoulder. This allowed Agatha to go even deeper, and she knew Rio wouldn’t last much longer.</p><p>“You look so good wrapped around my cock,” Agatha moaned. “I want you to come for me.”</p><p>All it took was two more thrusts and one swipe of her fingers for Rio’s whole body to arch off the bed.</p><p>Agatha felt a gush of wetness as Rio’s body went taut against her.</p><p>“Fuck, baby!” Rio’s mouth fell open, her nails digging into the flesh of Agatha’s back.</p><p>Agatha felt her spasm and stayed deep inside of her until she relaxed.</p><p>“Oh my god, Agatha,” Rio finally muttered into Agatha’s neck after catching her breath.</p><p>“Did you enjoy your math lesson?” Agatha smirked, slowly pulling out of Rio.  </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and crawled underneath Agatha’s shirt, poking her head out the top.</p><p>“Rio, you’re going to stretch it out,” Agatha groaned.</p><p>“Hey, you just stretched me out,” Rio quipped.</p><p>And you know what, fair is fair.</p><p>Their sweaty, spent bodies were pressed tightly together, and Rio pulled Agatha down into a slow kiss before pulling back and looking into her eyes.</p><p>Rio didn’t know what possessed her to say it in that moment, but word vomit and honesty had gotten her incredibly far in this relationship.</p><p>“I love you, Agatha,” Rio said, as her head was still poking through the neck hole of their shared shirt, the absurdity sinking in a bit.</p><p>Rio felt Agatha’s body still.</p><p>“I know people feel different things at certain phases in their relationship—but.”</p><p>“I love you, too, Rio.”</p><p>Rio was pretty sure the grin that spread across her face could have broken it.</p><p>“But if you do your fist pump thing right now, I’m taking it back.” Agatha joked, looking down at her all-too-happy girlfriend.</p><p>Rio looped her arms around Agatha and snuggled into her chest. “I love you so much.”</p>

<p>“And what do you think of this shade of green?” Rio had at least 50 different green paint swatches taped to Agatha’s – well, actually, their bedroom wall.</p><p>She had asked this same exact question to Agatha 49 times previously, who had lost interest after the third inquiry.</p><p>“Yep, looks great, babe,” Agatha gave her a quick, reassuring smile from their bed and returned to her book.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio huffed and stomped over to Agatha’s side of the bed. She looked extra cute, clad in just an oversized t-shirt and fluffy socks. “This is OUR bedroom, and I want you to like the color.”</p><p>Agatha conceded, putting down her book to give her girl her full attention.</p><p>She grabbed Rio by the waist, pulling her down onto her lap. “You can paint the walls orange with purple polka dots.” She placed a chaste kiss on Rio’s lips. “Whatever gets you moved in and in my bed every night. I don’t care.”</p><p>“Yeah, so that’s a fuckin’ lie,” Rio scoffed. “I pick the wrong color and you’ll make me sleep on the couch for maybe ever.”</p><p>Agatha smiled deviously. “Aw, you know me so well. Better choose wisely.”</p><p>Rio decided the battle of the bedroom color could wait, sliding down Agatha’s body and nudging her book out of the way to snuggle into her chest.</p><p>“How’s the packing going?” Agatha ran her fingers through Rio’s hair as she settled against her, getting comfortable.</p><p>“Not bad,” Rio yawned. “The upstairs is pretty much packed up, and I should be able to knock out downstairs tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio had been working her ass off since Agatha asked her to move in with her. There really wasn’t much of a debate about who should move in with whom. Agatha’s place was bigger, nicer, and most importantly, paid off.</p><p>The only point of contention had been the greenhouse.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“Agatha, please,” Rio whined.  </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Rio, in no universe are you putting that massive greenhouse in my front yard.” Agatha wasn’t budging. “It’s ugly, it will kill my grass, you grow drugs in it, and did I mention it’s ugly?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Counterpoint, it’s not ugly, it won’t kill your grass, and you like the drugs that I grow in it.” Rio pouted. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha wasn’t sure if she just wanted the argument to be over or if she couldn’t stand to see Rio even remotely upset, so they compromised, meaning Rio gets an even larger greenhouse in the backyard. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Whatever she wants.</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>“Did you get a background check on that little twink and make sure he’s good for rent? Agatha asked.</p><p>“Okay, well, he has a name, it’s Billy, and you know that,” Rio chuckled against Agatha’s neck.</p><p>Sure, he wore more eyeliner than either of them combined, and the skinny jeans bordered on obscene, but he was a good kid with a steady income, and Rio was happy to help out. She remembered being young and trying to find her first place. Plus, the kid was weirdly obsessed with Agatha, and it amused Rio to no end.</p><p>“Yeah, Billy, that’s what I said,” Agatha mumbled nonchalantly, turning her attention back to her book.</p><p>The Agatha from a year ago would have had a panic attack at the thought of someone else encroaching on her space and her schedule. Now seeing Rio’s clothes and knick-knacks in her space brought her a sense of contentment and peace she hadn’t had since Nicky.</p><p>Home was finally feeling like her sanctuary again, not a lonely place she had to endure just to get to the next day. Home was no longer four oppressive walls with painful memories trapped in cardboard boxes. Home was two warm, brown eyes, a lopsided gap-tooth smile, and welcoming arms. Rio was her home.</p><p>“Mmm, forgot to tell you, I took tomorrow off to help you finish packing,” Agatha mumbled into the top of Rio’s head.</p><p>“You didn’t have to do that, babe, but thank you.” Rio suddenly remembered Billy was coming over tomorrow to start moving his things in. “Just so you know, Billy will also be there tomorrow.”</p><p>“Fuucckkkkk,” Agatha groaned.</p><p>“Bonding time!” Rio said chipperly.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, care to tell me why Billy is loading up all of my boxes you said you’d help me with?” Rio asked her oh, so helpful girlfriend, who was currently engrossed in Rio’s family photo album.</p><p>“Uh, yeah, it’s called paid labor, the backbone of this country.” Agatha gave her a mock salute. “And I just had my nails done. Plus, the kid is obsessed with me. I say jump, he says how high.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes.</p><p>“What we really should be talking about is you holding out your mullet phase from me.” Agatha flashed a baby picture up at Rio.</p><p>“Oh yeah, I liked to party,” Rio laughed.</p><p>“And you played the trombone?” Agatha bit her lip. “I bet the ladies were all over you.”</p><p>“Actually, I did pretty well for myself,” Rio said cockily. “I’m sure Mami will whip out all the home videos when we visit for Christmas. She hasn’t stopped talking about it.”</p><p>Rio saw a look of uncertainty flash in Agatha’s eyes. Agatha was good with parents, but it had been a long, long time since anyone had taken her home to meet them. And making a good impression on Rio’s parents was incredibly important to her.</p><p>“Hey.” Rio leaned down to kiss her on the forehead. “They are going to love you so much. Just like I do. Trust me.”</p><p>As if on cue, Billy stumbled into the living room. “I have the last few boxes loaded up, Ms. Harkness. Anything else I can do?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“No, that will be all twink—Teen,” Agatha caught herself.</p><p>Rio huffed and glared and Agatha.</p><p>“What?” she mumbled. “I said Teen.”</p><p>“I’m actually 18,” an overeager Billy piped up. “But you can call me Teen. I even like that better than Billy.”</p><p>“Right, well, thank you for your services, Teen,” Agatha tossed a hundred at Billy, who jumped to catch it.</p><p>She turned to Rio. “I’m heading home to start unpacking some of this. Call me if you need anything.”</p><p>“God, she’s great,” Billy said to Rio as Agatha left.</p><p>And Rio just chuckled. The power Agatha already had over this little gay boy was astonishing.</p><p> </p><p>It took Rio a few more hours to do a final walkthrough of the whole house. As excited as she was to start her next chapter, it was bittersweet. This was the first place that felt like home when she moved out of her parents’ house. It was her fresh start when she got her new job.</p><p>She had hosted game nights here, packed with her friends and music and laughter. She had cried on the couch when relationships didn’t work out. She had lain on the bathroom floor when she was sick or hungover, hugging the toilet.</p><p>And the countless nights she spent in her backyard looking up at the stairs. She had asked Agatha on their first date in her front yard. A lot of life had happened here.</p><p>But she was ready to trade it all in for this new adventure with Agatha.</p><p>Rio made sure to disclose to Billy all the tips and tricks for living in this house. For instance, the taps upstairs were switched. So cold was hot, and hot was cold.</p><p>There was a tricky light switch in the kitchen, which Rio affectionately called “Tricky Switch” (ironically, she also called Agatha this) that you had to smack before the light would come on. And sometimes the hose in the sink would get jammed, and water would squirt everywhere.</p><p> All were on her list of things to fix as a newly appointed landlord, but in the meantime, honesty was the best policy. Plus, the kid was getting a sweet deal on rent.</p><p>“Thanks again, Rio,” Billy said as Rio prepared to leave. “I, uh, did have one question, though.”</p><p>“Yeah, what’s up?”</p><p>“There’s some weed in the greenhouse, what should I do with it?”</p><p>“Oh, yeah,” Rio nodded. “It’s not a good look to grow over at Agatha’s house, so why don’t you keep it? Consider it a welcome to the neighborhood gift.”</p><p>Billy looked at her, slightly embarrassed. “I don’t really know what to do with it.”</p><p>“You smoke it, kid.” Rio tilted her head, not understanding.</p><p>“Oh, I usually just use my vape.” Billy held up what appeared to be a tiny square computer device that you could allegedly smoke out of. It even told you the time. Ridiculous.</p><p>“Jesus, you kids and your vapes,” Rio sighed. “Come on, I’ll school you.”</p><p> </p><p>“So, once you grind it up, grab your paper.” Rio demonstrated. “And I use what I like to call the burrito rule.”</p><p>The two were sprawled on the floor of the greenhouse with a rolling tray.</p><p>“You don’t want to put so much in that it’s spilling out because you’ll just waste it.” Rio began to roll. “And you want to make sure you’re evenly packing it as you roll, like so.”</p><p>“Oh, okay, I get it,” Billy nodded as he watched intently.</p><p>“Here, you try.” Rio handed over the tray.</p><p>Billy finished off Rio’s joint and started one of his own.</p><p>“Hey, you’re doing pretty good!” Rio said proudly. “A natural.”</p><p>Billy was almost finished when the greenhouse door swung open.</p><p>“Rio Vidal, are you teaching kids how to do drugs?” Agatha asked, hands on her hips.</p><p>A startled Billy dropped the tray, spilling weed and papers everywhere.</p><p>“No, I mean kinda, but he started it." Rio was instantly ready to throw him under the bus. “I mean, I’m teaching a kid, singular, how to do drugs. And he already did drugs. Just the lame way.”</p><p>“Ms. Harkness!” Billy shot up off the ground. “We were just, uh, we need to, we—”</p><p>“Be cool, kid.” Agatha walked over, picked up a joint, and tucked it away in her bra for safekeeping. “I’m confiscating this.”</p><p>Rio chuckled while a wide-eyed Billy just nodded.</p><p>Agatha moved to exit the greenhouse. “Rio, home.” Rio hopped up and followed her.</p><p>“Teen, don’t do drugs,” Agatha ordered sternly.</p><p>He nodded furiously.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still laughing as they walked home.</p><p>“Did you see his little face?” Rio giggled. “I thought he was going to faint.”</p><p>“My big, scary lawyer skills come in handy sometimes,” Agatha laughed.</p><p>Just as the two were about to go inside, a high-pitched, grating voice yelled across the yard.</p><p>“Yoo-hoo, ladies!”</p><p>
<em>Mrs. Hart, or Davis. Fuck. </em>
</p><p>Agatha groaned, and Rio nudged her. “Be nice.”</p><p>“I heard we’re going to be neighbors, Rio.” Mrs. Davis extended a loaf of bread, and Agatha’s face softened. “So, I brought you over a re-welcome to the neighborhood loaf of zucchini bread.”</p><p>Mrs. Davis immediately launched into how great it would be to have Rio closer and all of the projects she wanted her help with. Agatha left them on the porch to talk while she went inside to finish dinner.</p><p>When Rio finally got her ear back from Mrs. Davis, she walked inside, where Agatha had apparently been hard at work getting her unpacked.</p><p>Rio’s bass was now propped up in its stand against the living room wall. Her record collection had been added to Agatha and Nicky’s. A few of her family pictures now lined the hallways. A framed selfie of Agatha and Rio sat beside the one of Agatha and Nicky on the mantle.</p><p>It made Rio’s heart happy how much it already felt like home.</p><p>Her nose led her to the kitchen, where Agatha was stirring something that smelled incredible on the stove. Rio wrapped her arms around her waist and felt her relax into her touch.</p><p>“You doing okay, baby?” Agatha knew Rio’s head and heart were a mixture of emotions.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m just really happy.”</p><p>And the two stayed like that for a while, slightly swaying, enjoying each other’s presence, and excited for what the future held.</p><p>Agatha glanced at the calendar on the side of the fridge, realizing it was Monday night—trash night.</p><p>“Would you mind taking down the trash cans, babe? I completely forgot it was trash night.”</p><p>Rio smiled and nodded. Of course, how could she forget?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha settled deeper into the rocker in their newly converted nursery. Rio was ping-ponging around like a caffeinated chipmunk, and far be it from Agatha to interrupt. She was clearly a woman on a mission.</p><p>“Okay, all corners and edges are padded.” Rio was going through a mental checklist.</p><p>“Cabinet locks are on and working.” She tugged a handle to double-check.</p><p>“Outlet covers are in, and the monitor cords are hidden.” She said aloud to absolutely no one.</p><p>“Carbon monoxide and smoke detector batteries are brand new.” Rio hit the test button, and an annoying beep blared across the room.</p><p>Agatha grimaced and covered her ears, but continued to let her wife, yes wife, skirt around the edge of a full-blown spiral. She would intervene before it went too far.</p><p> </p><p>A lot of life had happened in the three years since Rio had moved in with Agatha.</p><p>Agatha was still a hot shit lawyer, and Rio was still loving the trash collector life. She sold her house to Billy a year after moving in with Agatha. Which was fortunate, because now they have a cheap babysitter.</p><p>Much to Agatha’s chagrin, Billy was basically Rio’s adopted baby brother. Like on multiple occasions, Agatha has had to break up a wrestling match between the two in the front yard type of shit.</p><p>But, back to the wife thing. Around year two, they planned a big vacation to Arizona—a week in Sedona and three days in Vegas.</p><p>On night two of Vegas, a very drunk Rio was staring lovingly at a very drunk Agatha. The gaudy gold lights of the slot machines were shining against Agatha’s flushed face and bleary eyes, her tongue darting around trying to find the straw in her drink. </p><p>They picked the Ace Ventura Pet Detective slot machine as one does. Agatha placed a way too high bet, pulled the lever, and was greeted with an “allllrriighhtttyyy then” in Jim Carrey’s exact cadence, which sent Agatha into hysterics.</p><p>And as Rio watched, what she knew now without a shadow of a doubt was the love of her life, laughing until she cried at a stupid slot machine, she found herself wondering why she wasn’t married to this person yet.</p><p>
<em>“Marry me.” Rio calmly said to Agatha, who was wiping tears of laughter from her cheeks. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha paused for a second, too drunk to fully assess the situation, so she continued to laugh. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Agatha, I’m serious. Marry me.” Rio grabbed her hand and smiled. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Rio, we’re drunk, in a dirty casino.” Agatha swiped two fingers across the top of the slot machine, gathering dust and grime, trying her best to make Rio understand how absurd the situation was. “And you’re wearing flip flops and a Hawaiian shirt.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You scared?” Rio wiggled her exposed toes and cocked an eyebrow at Agatha. “Guess I just love you more.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha took that as a challenge. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“No, psh I’ll marry you right now.” Agatha stood and dragged Rio with her. </em>
</p><p>And that’s how the two stumbled into a cheesy Vegas chapel, frozen Fat Tuesday drinks in hand, <em>fuckin’ tourists, </em>and got married by a drag Dolly Parton impersonator. Obviously, their family and friends were pissed, but they didn’t regret it for a second.</p><p> </p><p>The kid talk didn’t start till around year three.</p><p>They’d had a brief discussion before, but it was more Rio assuring Agatha it wasn’t something she needed to be happy. Rio always thought she would be a parent, but was more than happy to forego the kid dream and have it just be her and Agatha for the rest of their lives.</p><p>But Agatha was observant, often able to read Rio better than she could herself. She knew how good Rio was with kids, saw how her nieces and nephews and Alice’s nieces were absolutely crazy about her.</p><p>The two were out Christmas shopping when Rio wandered off for the 100<sup>th</sup> time that day. It was 50/50 on whether she would be in the toy or pet store, but the toy store was closer, so Agatha went in searching for her adult wife.  </p><p>“Rio, for the love, can you at least let me know before you decide to adventure off?” She walked up to her wife, who was engrossed in a giant train set.</p><p>“Agatha, are you seeing this?” Rio excitedly pointed to the train display, and Agatha couldn’t help but smile. “We’re totally setting this up under our tree.”</p><p>Agatha had never said it out loud, but it was largely due to Rio’s childlike sense of wonder and general goofiness that she found herself enjoying life more. Agatha was kinder, softer; she let others in and allowed herself to feel joy in a way she hadn’t in years.</p><p>“I can’t believe kids’ toys these days.” Rio’s eyes continued to roam the shelves. “All we had were those fuckass furbies that talked to you in your sleep.”</p><p>While Rio checked out the new Lego selection, Agatha let her mind drift, wondering what it would be like to watch Rio unwrap gift after gift with their child on Christmas morning. Assembling the toys Agatha didn’t have the patience for in the middle of wrapping paper mountain.</p><p>“Rio, do you want kids?” Agatha asked abruptly.</p><p>Rio stumbled. Her face contorted in confusion and worry, scared to say the wrong thing.</p><p>“Be honest, baby.”</p><p>“I— well yeah, I kind of always thought I would be a parent, but I know it’s not as simple as that, Agatha. I’m more than happy for it to be just us.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and didn’t say more about it until they were eating dinner that night. Rio was mid-slurp on a lo mein noodle when Agatha broached the subject again.</p><p>“So, were you thinking adoption?” Agatha asked with all the subtlety of a semi-truck.</p><p>Rio choked on the noodle. “I mean, I guess. I’ve never wanted to carry, and I assume you don’t want to again. But, baby, look, we really don’t need to talk about all this.”</p><p>“I want to, Rio.” Agatha grasped Rio’s hand. “I’m ready. I’m so in love with you and our life, and our family. I know if the world falls down around me this time, I’ll have all of you. I want this.”</p><p>Rio’s pretty sure the smile that spread across her face could have cracked it.</p><p>“Are we having a baby?” Rio stood and straddled Agatha’s lap.</p><p>“We’re having a baby.” Agatha pulled Rio down into a soft kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Because of Agatha’s rich, white lady privilege and connections in the foster system, they were able to find a baby quickly. They would be adopting a baby boy from a young woman who got involved in some unfortunate circumstances and didn’t feel ready to be a mother.</p><p>And roughly six months later, on a hot June night, Agatha and Rio received a call from the hospital that their son’s birth mother was in labor and they should head to the hospital. Fourteen hours later, he was a stubborn little guy, Rio held a 6-pound, 21-inch healthy baby boy in her arms.</p><p>Agatha lived for experiencing firsts with Rio, and she knew this was one she would remember for a lifetime. She knew that feeling well, the way your chest cracks open from feeling so much love you never knew you could have for a person. She felt it with Nicky, and now Rio was feeling that with their son.</p><p> </p><p>And that catches us up to Rio’s pending spiral. The hospital kept their son for a few days to monitor, but he was heading home tomorrow. The nursery had been ready to go for months now, but that didn’t stop Rio from double-checking everything.</p><p>“What about the mobile?” Rio glanced over at Agatha.</p><p>“What about it?”</p><p>“Well, do you think it’s sturdy enough?”</p><p>“Yes, love.” Agatha laughed.</p><p>“Because I could reinforce it.” Rio began looking around for her drill.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“I swear it was just here,” Rio muttered.</p><p>“Baby.” Agatha stood.</p><p>“I’ll just put in a few more screws to be sure.”</p><p>“Hey.” Agatha grabbed Rio’s face softly, squishing her cheeks, and looked into her eyes. “Everything is perfect, I promise.” She kissed her on the nose to punctuate her point.</p><p>“And what’s this?” Agatha pointed to a makeshift belt Rio was sporting.</p><p>“Oh, check it out.” Clearly very proud of her creation. “I made it for nighttime duty. It has a spot for a bottle, a backup bottle, pacifier, diaper, and burping cloth.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t believe how endearing she found this dork.</p><p>She pulled Rio in by the belt, hoping to distract from her baby spiral. “Well, check you out, daddy.”</p><p>Rio’s face morphed into a look of disgust.</p><p>“Yeah, as soon as it left my mouth, it felt weird.” Agatha laughed and gently ran her fingertips across the top of Rio’s waistband.</p><p>Rio quirked an eyebrow. “Definitely not into the daddy thing, but I’m not opposed to trying to get you pregnant.” She discarded her belt and wrapped Agatha around her waist instead.</p><p>“Do you know how much money we could have saved?” Agatha lamented.  </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and carried Agatha to their bedroom.</p><p>They enjoyed one last child-free romp knowing their sex life was about to take a significant hit. And hours later, when they were sweat-covered with achy thighs, Agatha sprawled across Rio’s chest, fingers tracing her ribs.</p><p>“Everything is about to change, isn’t it?” Rio asked with the biggest smile on her face.</p><p>“Yeah, it is.” Agatha kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>Despite assuring friends and family that they didn’t need anything, Alice, Lilia, Mrs. Davis, and Billy were all standing on their porch under a giant “Welcome Home” banner when Rio and Agatha returned from the hospital, son in tow.</p><p>“Get ready to meet the clown brigade, buddy.” And Rio’s pretty sure he smiled back at her.</p><p>“Ready, baby?” Rio asked Agatha with a small who gave a small, happy nod in response.</p><p>Mrs. Davis and Lilia had first dibs on the baby. Mrs. Davis brought over more baked goods than the two women could even imagine eating, and told them not to worry about cooking dinner for at least a month.</p><p>Lilia had embroidered a bunch of onesies with “New Jersey Sanitation Department Crew” on them, which had Rio absolutely melting. Lilia and Agatha were exchanging bedtime tips when Alice finally snuck away with the baby.</p><p>Rio followed them down the hallway and watched Alice gently rock her little guy. It was about time for him to take a nap. He had a big day.</p><p>“Now, say ‘fuck,” Alice whispered into his ear.</p><p>Rio cackled. “If Agatha hears that, she’ll kill you.”</p><p>“Speaking of.” Alice pulled a book out from behind her back. “I know you guys said no more gifts, but I think you’ll appreciate it.”</p><p>Rio looked down at the book in her hands, aptly titled, <em>Go the Fuck to Sleep.</em></p><p>“Dude, that’s hilarious.” Rio chuckled. “Don’t let Agatha see it.”</p><p>“Don’t let me see what?” Agatha appeared out of thin air behind Rio.</p><p>“Nothing, baby.” Rio kissed her cheek. “I think little man is ready for a nap, though.” She pointed to the baby who was fast asleep in Alice’s arms.</p><p>“Did you guys decide on a name yet?” Alice asked.</p><p>“No, it will come to us when the time is right,” Rio assured her.</p><p>Agatha and Rio said goodbye to their guests, promising Mrs. Davis they would give her a call when they got hungry, and made their way up to the nursery.</p><p>“Great, you guys are here!” Billy said, ironically, from the closet. “I’ve sorted all of his outfits by season and color coordinated all of his shoes.”</p><p>“Of course you did, Teen.” Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“You’ll thank me when you’re putting outfits on him with your eyes closed because you’re never sleeping again.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, thanks, bud.” Rio clapped him on the back. “We’ll call you when his soft spot fills in so you can’t do any permanent damage.</p><p>Billy looked offended while Agatha smirked.</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the day was pretty uneventful. They called it a night early, and their little guy went down pretty easily, which shocked them both.</p><p>But their luck didn’t last long when shrill cries echoed through the house at 2 a.m. Instinctively, Agatha hopped out of bed.</p><p>Rio put a hand on her shoulder. “Let me give it a shot.” And Agatha settled back into bed, letting Rio give the new mom thing a go.</p><p>And she must have done a pretty good job, because the house was silent again after about 15 minutes. Rio had turned the monitor off so Agatha wouldn’t be bothered, but after a while, curiosity got the best of her.</p><p>Agatha walked lightly so the floorboards wouldn’t creak under her feet, and as she got closer to the nursery, she heard tiny mumblings coming from Rio.</p><p>“And these are all your books.” Rio was giving him a tour of his room. “You’re going to have to learn to read fast, though, because the idiots running our country don’t like people who can read, and we’re better than them.”</p><p>Agatha softly chuckled.</p><p>“This is your window, and if you look outside, you can see our garden. Which I don’t super know if that matters to you, because I heard baby’s eyes suck. You’ll have to let me know.”</p><p>“And this is your bird mobile. I hope you like animals, because your room is filled with a shit—I mean a ton. There are a lot of animals in here.”</p><p>Rio crossed the room to his crib, where all of their family pictures hung. She introduced him to his grandparents and all of his cousins, before she got to a photo of Agatha and Nicky.</p><p>“And this little guy right here is Nicky. He would have loved being your big brother. Your momma will tell you all about him one day.”</p><p>“Speaking of your momma, this is her. She’s the smartest, most beautiful woman on the planet. You really lucked out, ya know.”</p><p>“And this is me, your other momma. I’m pretty cool, too. I can teach you all about plants and how to drive a trash truck. I can teach you how to dunk when you get a little taller. We’re going to have the best life, kid.” Rio walked them over to the rocker and placed a soft kiss on her son’s head, who was now fast asleep.</p><p>Agatha shifted in the doorframe, and a sleepy Rio looked up and smiled softly as Agatha walked into the nursery. She carefully slid into the rocker behind Rio, encouraging her to lean back so she could hold her wife and their baby.</p><p>She glanced up at the picture of Nicky hanging on the wall and knew he would be so happy and proud. Agatha felt Rio’s weight on her as her breathing began to slow, getting deep and shallow.</p><p>It felt a bit like midnight on Christmas Eve when your whole family is asleep. The chaos of the day long past and all annoyances and grievances forgiven—everything is peaceful and still. Sure, tomorrow the chaos would start up again, but for now, everything and everyone you love and care about are calm, quiet, and safe.</p><p>Agatha leisured in that calm, quiet, safe, and holy space, feeling like she held the world in her arms, because really, she did.</p><p> </p>
