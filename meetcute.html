<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Lilia drags Agatha to a New Year's Eve party at a lesbian party and she'd rather be anywhere else. At least until she sees the coat check girl, who is reading a book at a party and somehow becomes the most intriguing person in the room to Agatha.</p><p>Rio was suckered into working as a coat check girl at her roommate's girlfriend's New Year's Eve party in exchange for free drinks, tips, and $500 in a night. Alice is too good at batting her eyelashes to get what she wants, but at least nobody bothers her...until Agatha asks what book she's reading and Rio can't help but be taken aback by the other woman's beauty.</p><p>What happens when sparks fly in a bar neither of them wants to be at on New Year's Eve?</p></blockquote>

</p><p>
<span>“I hate you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You </span>
<em>
<span>love</span>
</em>
<span> me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lets out a little growl in the back of her throat as Lilia practically drags her down the street, snow swirling around them but thankfully not yet sticking to the ground underneath her feet. It’s chilly out tonight, and Agatha is attempting to wrap herself more tightly in the deep purple coat she’d just barely had time to grab before her old friend had practically shoved her out the door, declaring that </span>
<em>
<span>neither</span>
</em>
<span> of them was about to ring in the New Year alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to murder you,” Agatha huffed. “Unless you kill me first. Will you slow down? I’m going to slip on a patch of ice and then we’ll both go down. Have fun dancing the new year in with a broken hip, grandma.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not that much older than you, doll,” Lilia huffed, slowing down a fraction but still not nearly enough. “And you’ll be here sooner than you think.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That is a very mean thing to say to me,” Agatha complained, trying again, unsuccessfully, to tug her hand out of Lilia’s grasp. “Are we quite there yet?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Quit it with the impatience!” Lilia said. “It’s right up here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stopped outside a bar that was practically shaking with the deep bass of some kind of music. Agatha looked up at the sign above the door: </span>
<em>
<span>The Witches’ Road</span>
</em>
<span>. There were all kinds of pride flags littering the windows and the brick on the outside of the building. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“A Lesbian Bar? Really? That’s where you want us to ring in the New Year?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not?” Lilia asked. “We’re both lesbians. Also, they have karaoke tonight. You </span>
<em>
<span>know</span>
</em>
<span> how much you love to perform for adoring - and slightly tipsy - crowds.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said you were taking me to your friend’s party,” Agatha pointed out. “That social media woman. Jen…Corn?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Kale</span>
</em>
<span>,” Lilia corrected with a snort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“S’what I said,” Agatha said. “Why are we </span>
<em>
<span>here</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen rented the place out for the New Year,” Lilia said. “She just got a big brand deal.” Agatha looked unimpressed. “It’s an open bar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Out of my way,” Agatha said, shoving a cackling Lilia aside as she tugged open the door, feeling a warm blast of air accompanied by the sound of loud, off-key singing. She immediately began tugging at her scarf, sweat already starting to dot her brow without even needing to close the door behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Coat check,” Lilia said, stepping up beside her and pointing to a woman standing before a small room, smiling as she took coats in exchange for tickets. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman sitting at the table that had been set up for the coat check was pretty, Agatha thought, with deep brown eyes and long black hair that fell over one shoulder. She was dressed more casually than most of the people in the bar, wearing a green flannel over a black tank top and dark skinny jeans. She had a crocheted green beanie to match the color of her shirt and a pair of glasses that slipped down her nose. There was a book next to her that Agatha was suddenly very interested in finding out the name of.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me take your coat,” Agatha said, already half-tugging it off of Lilia’s body. The older woman spun around from the force of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is your rush?” Lilia huffed, glancing over to the coat check. “Ah,” she said. “I see. Go on then. Go swoon over your nerd.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pfft!” Agatha said, slipping off her own coat. “I don’t know what you mean. I’m just being a helpful friend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, if that’s all it is,” Lilia said, “stop it. You’re freaking me out.” She shoved Agatha in the direction of the coat check as the other woman rolled her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio </span>
<em>
<span>hated</span>
</em>
<span> New Year’s Eve. It was loud and chaotic and just </span>
<em>
<span>too much</span>
</em>
<span>. She preferred to be at home, watching the ball drop </span>
<em>
<span>alone</span>
</em>
<span> with a glass of wine. Or sleeping. Either worked for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Alice had </span>
<em>
<span>pleaded</span>
</em>
<span> with her, practically begged on her </span>
<em>
<span>knees</span>
</em>
<span> for Rio to do her this favor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll get tips,” she promised, “and Jen will give you five hundred for the night. All you have to do is sit there and take the coats. </span>
<em>
<span>Please</span>
</em>
<span>, Rio?” She had pouted, which usually didn’t work on Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she could tell that Alice was </span>
<em>
<span>actually</span>
</em>
<span> desperate to help out her girlfriend, so she had sighed, rolled her eyes, and ground out a simple, “Fine</span>
<em>
<span>, </span>
</em>
<span>but you owe me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will handle all chores for a month,” Alice promised. Rio knew it was a lie, but she acted as though she believed it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On New Year’s Eve, she had arrived at the lesbian bar around the corner from their apartment, dressed almost as casually as she would if she’d stayed home in jeans, a camisole, and a flannel, and a book under her arm. She’d even opted to wear her glasses instead of contacts tonight, giving her eyes a break from her finger poking into them for once. They were mainly for reading (hence her book) but sometimes she got a headache if she went without them for too long, so she pushed them back up her nose to see more clearly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>That’s</span>
</em>
<span> what you’re wearing?” Jennifer Kale, Alice’s semi-famous girlfriend, had said when she saw what was under Rio’s knee-length puffy winter jacket. “To a New Year’s Eve party?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can leave if you want,” Rio shot back. “I don’t need the money. Actually, let me just-” she gathered up her coat, intending to turn back, but Alice grabbed her arm, looking up at her quite desperately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t go,” she begged. “Jen, babe, say sorry now. We </span>
<em>
<span>need </span>
</em>
<span>her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen Kale pressed her lips into a thin line, stubborn. Alice glared at her, matching her energy, and Jen huffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” she said. “Sorry. You </span>
<em>
<span>are </span>
</em>
<span>just a coat check person. What you wear isn’t </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> important…I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was touching, Jen,” Rio snarked. “Very nice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever,” Jen huffed. “Just go sit down. The coat check room is all set up for you. Alice said you’ve done this before, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was the coat check girl for every Quinces in Westview for about five years,” Rio informed her. “All six of them. I know what I’m doing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Jen said. “The bar is open, but please don’t get smashed. Just…pace yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t drink,” Rio said. “Are they serving soda?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Jen said. “Of course. Coke is an integral part of Jacks and Coke, you know? Order whatever you like. Alice also made you a tip jar, which we will encourage people to use generously considering the service is covered as well as their drinks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks,” Rio said, giving her a little salute, before she made her way to the table right outside the coat room. She dropped down into the chair and opened her book, allowing herself to relax as Jen and Alice continued to set up the party. Alice delivered her first coke a few moments later. Rio gave her a nod in thanks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once the party was underway, Rio put in ear plugs. They didn’t completely block out the noise, but they did make it more tolerable. And it was easy to get into the groove of things. She had a roll of tickets next to her with numbers. There were over a thousand double-sided tickets. Rio would tear them off the roll, give one half to the guest, then clip the other half to the coat that they handed her and hang it up in the order that she was given them. It made it easier if everything was in order. </span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time she got to coat three hundred forty-six, the line had dwindled and she was able to have a few moments of peace, refocusing on her book for a moment before another body approached her. Jen had set up a karaoke machine on the small stage along the far wall of the bar meant for live music. These bitches could not sing if their lives depended on it, but it was kind of funny to watch them act like Gaga on the tiny platform stage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you reading?” a voice asked from above, tearing Rio’s gaze away from the drunk redhead butchering a Halsey song. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes widened slightly at the woman standing above her, wearing a silky purple blouse and tight, black leather pants. She had multiple studs and hoops all along the shells of her ears, and she was also wearing glasses, the rims square and thick. Her hair was falling in loose curls around her shoulders, stretching down her back. Still, she looked much more casual than most of the women there, who were in suits and sparkly dresses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>The Devil’s Candy</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio said, picking up the book to hand to her: “</span>
<em>
<span>The Anatomy of a Hollywood Fiasco.</span>
</em>
<span> Julie Salamon. You need me to take those coats?” It was a stupid question, but this woman had flustered her with one innocuous question and those devastatingly beautiful ocean-blue eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, please,” Agatha said, exchanging the two coats and taking the book. She read the back cover, her eyebrows lifting. “I love non-fiction,” she hummed. “I think I’ve heard of this one. It’s about that movie…uh…what was it called.” Her eyes widened as she found the name on the back cover. “</span>
<em>
<span>The Bonfire of the Vanities</span>
</em>
<span>, right!” She rolled her eyes. “The book was much better, obviously.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was in love instantly, but she wasn’t about to say that. That was crazy talk, even by lesbian standards. And she didn’t even know that this woman </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> a lesbian. For all she knew, she was one of Jen’s straight </span>
<em>
<span>influencer</span>
</em>
<span> friends. And how embarrassing would it be to have to tell Jen that she’d been shot down by one of </span>
<em>
<span>those</span>
</em>
<span>?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have two coats,” she said, instead, trying to stay casual as she ripped two tickets from the roll, attaching one tag to each of the coats. “Is one your wife’s?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My…” the woman’s eyes widened in surprise, then she started to laugh. “Gods, no!” she said. “No, Lilia is just my friend. A work colleague, really. One whose murder I am planning as we speak.” She motioned to a woman speaking with Jen and Alice at the bar. She was wearing a sparkly yellow jumpsuit and chunky heels. Her hair was brown and graying, tied up in a messy bun on the back of her head. She cackled like a witch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kinda liked her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I,” the woman said, “am unattached.” The way she said that just…</span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> something to Rio. It was a little suggestive, but she could have been imagining that. “Honestly, if she hadn’t dragged me here tonight, I’d be spending my New Year’s Eve on the couch with a book not unlike this one.” She tossed it back onto the table. “What did they blackmail </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> with to get you here tonight?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Money,” Rio said. “And free soda.” She lifted her glass of coke. “It’s the only thing keeping me awake right now. This and the sounds of cats dying on that stage right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, they’re </span>
<em>
<span>awful</span>
</em>
<span>,” the woman said, pulling a chair from a nearby table and sitting down next to Rio, her eyes on the stage, where a blonde woman had taken up residence, belting out the wrong words to an Adele song. The crowd was </span>
<em>
<span>loving </span>
</em>
<span>it. “My name’s Agatha, by the way,” the woman said, turning back to Rio with a lopsided grin. “Agatha Harkness.” She held out one delicate hand, which Rio took, feeling a spark run up her arm at the touch of their palms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio Vidal,” she said. “I’m Alice’s roommate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice?” Agatha asked, furrowing her brow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen’s girlfriend?” Another blank stare. “You don’t know the people hosting the event?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m a plus-one,” Agatha reminded her. “Lilia is friends with the influencer, Jan Corn.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t help the laugh that bubbled up at that, shaking her head when Agatha gave her a small grin. Oh, she had </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> done that on purpose, but that’s now all Rio would be able to think about the next time she spoke to Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or Jan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hehe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re Alice’s roommate?” Agatha asked. “</span>
<em>
<span>Just</span>
</em>
<span> her roommate?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Rio confirmed. “</span>
<em>
<span>Just</span>
</em>
<span> the roommate. I’m pretty sure Jen would kill me if I ever even </span>
<em>
<span>thought</span>
</em>
<span> about making a move on Alice. And she has the connections to get away with it.” Agatha snorted. “No, I’m single,” she said, just to be clear. “Unattached.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned at that, and Rio felt her stomach flutter as the other woman leaned in. “Is that so?” she asked. “Then I suppose there would be nobody to protest you…singing a duet with me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked at her. “Is that a euphemism?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cackled. “No,” she said. “I’m quite the performer, actually. Couldn’t you tell?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio eyed her up and down. She was hot, definitely meant to be seen by anybody with eyes, even if she couldn’t perform if her life depended on it. But there was a glint in those eyes, a confidence that Rio could see practically </span>
<em>
<span>proved</span>
</em>
<span> that Agatha was meant to be on a stage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Prove it,” Rio said. “Go up and put on a show.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come with me,” Agatha said, reaching for Rio’s hand, tugging gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, no,” Rio said, chuckling, “I am </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> a performer. I figured the nerdy glasses and book at a party would have told you that. Besides the fact I’m wearing ear plugs.” She pushed her hair back, showing off the little pieces of foam in her ears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just one song,” Agatha said. “Please?” She batted her long lashes at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The coats,” Rio said, weakly, motioning to the coat room with her free hand, not daring to break the connection between their bodies. “I have to…watch them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That is such a lame excuse,” Agatha huffed. “I mean, everybody is already here. Hell, I’ve been talking to you for, like, ten minutes and nobody else has even walked through the doors. And nobody is going to leave before midnight. Come </span>
<em>
<span>on</span>
</em>
<span>, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The way Agatha said her name…Rio was too gay for this. Too smitten with this woman she’d known for </span>
<em>
<span>less than a fucking hour</span>
</em>
<span>. Less than </span>
<em>
<span>half</span>
</em>
<span> an hour!</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a groan, rolling her eyes. “Alice!” she said, looking over Agatha’s shoulder. Alice spun around where she was standing, talking to some friends of Jen. Her eyes widened at Rio and she pointed to the bar, asking silently if what Rio wanted was another soda. Rio shook her head, motioning her over. Alice put her beer down on the bar stop and walked over, her pace quick and bouncy, as always.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s up?” she asked, chipperly, smiling up at them. “Who’s this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Agatha said, shaking her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh! Lilia’s friend!” Alice said. “Nice to meet you. I’m Alice: Jen’s girlfriend and Rio’s roommate. You two know each other?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was just about to tell her that no, they did </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> know each other, but Agatha beat her to the punch, wrapping her arm around Rio’s waist, pulling her in. Rio’s face suddenly felt </span>
<em>
<span>super</span>
</em>
<span> hot, which was saying a lot for the increasingly stuffy bar. “Old friends, actually,” Agatha lied. “We were just catching up and </span>
<em>
<span>I</span>
</em>
<span> thought I’d invite my old buddy, Rio, here to sing a duet with me. It’s okay if she leaves her post for a couple of minutes, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh…” Alice looked behind them at the coat room, then back to Jen, then back to Agatha and Rio. “I guess so?” she said. “Just one song, right? And not, like, Bohemian Rhapsody or anything?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Promise,” Agatha laughed. “No Bohemian Rhapsody. Thanks, Alison!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s Alice,” Alice said, even as Agatha dragged Rio away. Rio gave her an apologetic smile over her shoulder. Alice just shook her head and rolled her eyes, walking over to sit by the coat room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t wait for her turn. She skipped right to the front of the line, keeping Rio’s hand in her vise-like grip, ignoring the protests around them as she searched through the catalogue of songs before she found the </span>
<em>
<span>perfect</span>
</em>
<span> one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She showed it to Rio, who groaned. “</span>
<em>
<span>That </span>
</em>
<span>one?” she said. “Seriously?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not?” Agatha asked, with a shrug. “I’ll let you take the Bradley Cooper parts.” She batted those eyelashes again and Rio was defenseless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” she said. “You better be good, otherwise we are going to </span>
<em>
<span>both</span>
</em>
<span> sound like dying cats out there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Baby, you have </span>
<em>
<span>no</span>
</em>
<span> idea,” Agatha purred, winking at Rio as she walked onto the stage, shooing off the woman who had just demolished a Cher classic - in a bad way. She grabbed one of the mics, handing it to Rio, then placed hers on the mic stand. “You guys are in for a treat tonight,” she said to the crowd. “Just you wait.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She crouched next to the karaoke machine, inputting their number, then stood up again. The chords began to play and there were some cheers from the audience. Agatha looked out and saw Lilia holding up her martini, grinning because she knew what came next.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled at Rio, nodding encouragingly. Rio took one of her ear plugs out to better hear the music, taking a deep breath as she tried to ignore the crowd in front of her, focusing only on the mic. She cleared her throat, watching the words come up on the screen in front of them before she began to sing.</span>

</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>And in the bad times, I fear myself.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at Rio as she sang. She wasn’t the best singer in the world, but she also wasn’t half-bad. Her singing voice was a bit deeper than her speaking voice, and it made Agatha shiver as she listened to it. Then it was </span>
<em>
<span>her </span>
</em>
<span>turn.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Tell me something, boy.</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>Aren’t you tired trying to fill that void?</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>Or do you need more?</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’m falling</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>In all the good times,</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>I find myself longing for change</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>And in the bad times, I fear myself.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She took a breath, feeling the music shift inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’m off the deep end,</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>Watch as I dive in.</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>I’ll never reach the ground.</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>Crash through the surface,</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>Where they can’t hurt us.</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>We’re far from the shallow now.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She met Rio’s eyes, which were wide in astonishment. Agatha grinned at her, reaching out to take Rio’s free hand again. She linked their fingers together, watching the flush spread across Rio’s face, reaching up to the tips of her ears. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, they sang together:</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“In the sha-ha, sha-ha-llow,</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-llow,</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>In the sha-ha, sha-ha-llow,</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>We’re far from the shallow now.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed as the music began to intensify. This was her favorite part. She locked eyes with Rio, who gave her an almost imperceptible but encouraging nod. Agatha nodded back, not letting go of her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Oh, ha-ah-ah</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>Ah, ha-ah-ah, oh, ah,</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>Ha-ah-ah-ah.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her lungs were burning, but she didn’t care, lifting the hand not holding Rio’s to grasp the mic stand.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’m off the deep end,</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>Watch as I dive in.</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>I’ll never meet the ground.</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>Crash through the surface,</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>Where they can’t hurt us.</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>We’re far from the shallow now.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped up next to her, sharing her mic as she placed hers on a stool behind her, their shoulders brushing at the proximity of their bodies.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“In the sha-ha, sha-ha-llow</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-llow</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>In the sha-ha, sha-ha-llow</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>We're far from the shallow now.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught in her lungs as she looked up at Rio, who was breathing just as heavily as she was. She swallowed thickly, leaning in to press her lips to the shell of Rio’s ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bathroom,” she husked before walking offstage to the sounds of a room of lesbians cheering for them. Rio’s fingers slipped from hers and she felt the absence of them acutely, but Agatha kept walking, making her way to the bathroom in the back of the bar, thrilling when she pushed through the door to find that it was a single-stall kind of room. There were three of them in the bar, so it wasn’t like anybody would be disrupting them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hoped not, anyway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at herself in the mirror. She still had her blocky glasses on. They were the ones she wore to dissuade anybody from approaching her in public. She hated being hit on when she wasn’t in the mood, and she </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> hadn’t been in the mood when Lilia dragged her out of the house after forcing her into the ‘only sexy clothes you own’ according to Lilia.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then she’d seen Rio and she thought…</span>
<em>
<span>hmm, maybe</span>
</em>
<span>. And then she’d </span>
<em>
<span>spoken</span>
</em>
<span> to Rio and thought that </span>
<em>
<span>perhaps</span>
</em>
<span> she could have somebody to kiss at midnight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she’d sung with Rio. She was </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> sexually attracted to good singing voices. She wasn’t a freak. She just…</span>
<em>
<span>felt things</span>
</em>
<span> when Rio had looked at her during the song, like Agatha was the only one in the room. Like they were the last two people in the universe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gods be damned, she had it </span>
<em>
<span>bad</span>
</em>
<span> after less than an hour in the other woman’s company.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha popped a couple buttons on her blouse, allowing just the lacy edge of her bra to show. She looked in the mirror, removing the blocky glasses, folding them and placing them on the edge of the sink. The world blurred slightly around the edges, but that was fine. She could see how hot she looked just fine. She’d be able to see how hot </span>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
<span> looked even if she suddenly went blind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why’d you take them off?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha jumped, turning away from the mirror to find Rio leaning back against the door, her head tilted to the side, a soft smile on her face. She watched as Rio’s gaze flickered down to Agatha’s chest then quickly back up to her eyes, her own widening slightly as her throat bobbed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They would have gotten in the way,” Agatha said, stalking toward her, slowly, letting her hips swing a little more than strictly necessary.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In the way of what?” Rio asked, her breath stuttering in her lungs as Agatha reached her, leaning in until their lips were so close that they may as well have been doing what Agatha so desperately wanted to do. But she held off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think you know,” she husked, her hands landing on Rio’s waist. Rio let out a soft moan, her teeth sinking into her bottom lip as her eyes dropped to look at Agatha’s lips, wanton and desperate. Her own hands lifted to push a lock of hair away from Agatha’s face, her thumb stroking just underneath her eye.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Show me,” she murmured, just seconds before Agatha surged forward, pressing her lips to Rio’s as the other woman moaned into her mouth, her arms binding around Agatha’s waist, pulling her flush against her body.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where’s Rio?” Jen asked, walking up to Alice, who was nursing a beer at the coat check table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In the bathroom, I think,” Alice said. “It’s fine. She deserves a short break.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, she better get back soon,” Jen said. “I am </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> kissing you at midnight by the coat check. That’s what I’m paying </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> for.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You really wouldn’t kiss me?” Alice asked, pouting up at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t use that face on me,” Jen said, pointing a finger at her. “That’s wholly unfair of you.” The pout deepened. Jen groaned. “If she makes me kiss you at the coat check because she can do her fucking job…holy shit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Alice asked, following the direction of Jen’s gaze, her eyes widening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness stepped out of one of the three bathrooms, her previously soft, neat curls suddenly wild around her head, sticking up at odd angles. The buttons on her blouse were mismatched and her bra…was sticking out of her pocket. Her lipstick had also been completely wiped off and she was missing her glasses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve </span>
<em>
<span>got</span>
</em>
<span> to be fucking kidding me,” Jen hissed. “</span>
<em>
<span>Her</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s wrong with her?” Alice asked. “She seems nice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She keeps calling me Jen </span>
<em>
<span>Corn</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, she’s not good with names,” Alice said, “but still…wait, did she…are they…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exited the bathroom a minute later, while Agatha was casually ordering something at the bar. Her beanie was laying haphazardly on her head, but her hair was completely mussed underneath. The hem of her camisole had ridden up, exposing a stretch of the skin of her belly, her jeans buttoned but </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> zipped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yup,” Jen sighed, crossing her arms over her chest. “They just fucked at my New Year’s party. Can’t bring lesbians </span>
<em>
<span>anywhere</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They watched as Rio walked up behind Agatha, slapping her ass playfully, making Agatha jump in surprise, a laugh escaping her lips as she turned in Rio’s arms, slapping her shoulder before she wound her arms around Rio’s shoulder and leaned in for a kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aww,” Alice said. “They’re kind of cute together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They just </span>
<em>
<span>fucked</span>
</em>
<span> at my </span>
<em>
<span>party</span>
</em>
<span> on my </span>
<em>
<span>dime</span>
</em>
<span>, Alice!” Jen hissed. “That is </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> cute!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a </span>
<em>
<span>little</span>
</em>
<span> cute,” Alice said, standing and wrapping her arms around Jen from behind. “Besides, we did the same thing at Natasha’s Halloween party, didn’t we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> fault that Wonder Woman costume got you all hot and bothered,” Jen huffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think it was more about the lasso, actually,” Alice purred into Jen’s neck. Jen felt her face warm and she cleared her throat, rolling her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she said, “they can be cute. But Rio better get over here and do her fucking job before the ball starts to drop. We’ve only got a few more minutes now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio!” Alice called out. Rio spun around, her face flushing as she looked at Jen. Agatha hid her face in her drink, but she was clearly laughing. Alice motioned her over. “Come on!” she said. “Break’s over!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Get over here, Vidal!” Jen said. “Or I’m docking your pay!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, reaching back for Agatha, who handed her another glass of soda before taking her free hand and allowing Rio to pull her back to the coat check table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Rio said, grinning like she wasn’t sorry at all as she reclaimed her seat, the grin widening as Agatha perched herself in her lap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Disgusting,” Jen huffed, tugging her girlfriend’s hand back to the bar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Adorable,” Alice countered, tucking herself under Jen’s arm.</span>
