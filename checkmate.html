<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>From the moment she steps out of the impossibly cheap cab, Jennifer could feel the dullness in the air. Though she appreciates the lack of typical Washington humidity, there’s a replaced sense of total unhealth, of total lack of spirit and verve. As she enters Pawnee City Hall for the first time, it takes all of her might to not turn around and flee. She doesn’t like to use the word <em>poor</em>, but…</p><p>Who is she kidding. She loves to use the word. And this town, if one can even call it a town, is dripping in it.  </p><p>Jen hates to speak to these people. Anyone dressed in business casual attire is not worthy of her time. So, she finds her way to the competition’s office herself. Her heels stick to the floor with each quick step— she moves far faster than any of the sluggish clerks and absurdly high-ranking city officials that don’t seem to really be doing any work at all. Every door she pulls open is also covered in this same sickening stickiness. Thank God for the invention of handkerchiefs.</p><p>“Oh, Jesus.” Jennifer can’t help the words from spewing out when she pulls open the door to the Parks and Recreation offices. It’s just all so… sad. The menial workers don’t react to her entrance, barely do anything at their desk anyway. She scowls at the sight of it, of the aging employees typing with only two fingers at a time and the younger ones who stare at their phones instead of doing anything meaningful. Everything is so slow, nothing like the pace of a D.C. election circuit. A <em>real</em> election, something actually worth Jen’s brain power. But hey, it’s easy work, and she’d be damned not to take it. The moment she and the man-child win this town over, she’ll be off to summer on an island. What island, she could not possibly care less. As long as it’s far away from Pawnee, Indiana.</p><p>Not seeing the yapping, overexcitable blonde anywhere, Jennifer’s eyes land instead on a much more pleasant sight. The youngest employee who sits with her feet propped on the desk in front of her, reading a book. She has a jadedness about her, as if in this building filled with people who barely know how to do their job, she is the one that wants to do it the least. While Jennifer would usually find this disinterest so stale, especially on someone of this age, there’s something beneath the sideswept bangs that intrigues her, <em>attracts </em>her.</p><p>Jen straightens herself, takes the few steps it takes to make it to the younger woman’s desk, leans over it a bit.</p><p>“Excuse me,” She says louder than necessary in the near-silent room. The raven-haired employee does not reply, only sticks up one finger as if to say <em>my book is more important than you</em>, continues reading. Jennifer is… impressed. A smirk rises to her lips at the action, and she waits patiently. Though she’d never accept such a thing in her own office, she appreciates the challenge. At least there’s one other person in this God-forsaken town that’s willing to play chess where the others play checkers.</p><p>When her challenger finally finishes her chapter, she sets down her book and raised finger, finally glances up at Jennifer. Her eyes widen for a moment, a minute expression that would barely be caught if it weren’t quite literally Jennifer’s job to catch such a thing. The smirk still evident on her own face, Jen speaks up again.</p><p>“I’m here to see Leslie Knope.” She leans over the desk a bit more, wishing she weren’t so damn buttoned up, wishing to see that bewildered expression on the intern’s face again.</p><p>“Uhm, yeah.” The other says plainly, her voice shockingly deep, carrying the same indifference that the rest of her does. She then realizes her place, must recognize Jennifer Barkley for who she is, and sits up straight in her chair, feet dropping to the floor. She points to the door at her left. “Her office is in there.”</p><p>There’s the blush that Jennifer had been looking for. She pulls back, straightens up, flicks her hair over the shoulder once, twice. She turns on her heels with ever the dramatic flair and walks to where the black-painted nail had directed her. Even though this meeting would be excruciating, at least she’d have this little memory of Knope’s pretty receptionist. Or whatever lousy job title the woman held.</p><p>“Hey, aren’t you that lady that called Leslie a dog murderer?” The deep voice calls out again, eliciting a silent laugh from Jennifer. As she enters the next room, she looks back over her shoulder, winks to the girl. Jen hates to wear a smile as she enters this meeting, but the puzzled expression she’d been met with could only bring such a thing.</p><p>She exchanges false pleasantries with the overzealous blonde, barely registers a word said. They’re discussing campaign strategies, billboards, yard signs… something like that. Who knows. Jennifer is too busy looking out the door to the desk so perfectly placed in direct view. Well, not exactly direct. She has to arch her back and pretend to be looking away out of boredom, but once she has subtly shifted her chair backwards just enough, her apathetic piece of eyecandy is back in view. She can’t take her eyes off of the woman whose nose is deep into her book. Jennifer finds herself far more interested in finding out the title of the book than she is in Knope’s incessant chattering about candy bars and voting procedures. Once she finds out just what sort of book it is that she likes, Jennifer will buy her an entire library’s worth. It’s not like she’d be taking any away from the avid readers of Pawnee, of which there are none. She’d probably be able to buy out the town’s public library with the money she’s making from the Newport family alone. Maybe she will, if it’ll force that straight line into a smile.</p><p>It feels like truly an eternity that Jennifer is sitting in this office, though she doesn’t mind it for the view that she’s given. There does come a time where she actually does need to reciprocate the conversation, to act aghast at the implication that she’s not paying attention, and as painful as it is, she turns her attention away from her new obsession. She continues in witty banter for the rest of their allotted time, outsmarting Leslie’s campaign moves with outrageous ease. Seriously, Jennifer Barkley is good at her job. No wonder she’s paid so much.</p><p>When she’s finally allowed escape from this small room that smells so much like the most obnoxious cologne known to man, she takes it. Though she could spend hours wheedling out Leslie’s ideas, spinning them into her own far better planned knock-offs, Jennifer is desperate to leave. She can feel her brain actively slowing down with each second spent in this wretched building. So, with the sweetest possible goodbye she can muster up with those last few remaining cells of energy, she leaves.</p><p>But, before she does, she allows herself one more little visit to the desk by the window, to the girl who has reassumed her previously relaxed position, her book now propped open on her lap, her eyes moving far too quickly to actually be reading. Jennifer smiles to herself, appreciates the attempt at disregard for what it is, knows that the blush is threatening the intern’s cheeks again. She can tell that she’s chewing the inside of her cheek, forcing her vision away from Jen, but she doesn’t mind. She’ll get the eye contact she so deeply desires soon enough.</p><p>The standing of the two reaches into her purse, the bag that she would never let touch a surface in this building, and produces a business card. She slides it down into the open-faced book on the woman’s lap, laughs softly when it elicits a jump out of her.</p><p>“Call me.” She purrs, once she finally has the latter’s attention. She sends another wink her way before finally leaving, feet still fighting un-mopped floor.</p><p>And as for April… April watches her leave, jaw hanging open as if she’s just seen a ghost. She feels incredibly dirty for the way that her vision glues to the swinging hips, but the curvature squeezed by pencil skirt begs to be worshipped as it disappears into the hallway.  </p><p align="center">__________________________</p><p>It doesn’t take many days for Jennifer to grow painfully bored of her hotel room. One can only watch Joan Callamezzo ramble nonsense for so many hours in a day. And though she does not feel like entering into Pawneean society, there must be somewhere where she can get an actual mixed drink instead of <em>another </em>bottle of hotel wine, so she turns to the internet. It comes to no surprise that Pawnee’s nightlife is far from illustrious, and though her only options are clubs of the night and strip varieties, she settles for the former. She doesn’t even want to imagine what beasts will haunt the night scene on a Wednesday night in the middle of nowhere, but she finds out soon enough upon entering the bar whose name she forgets before even reading it.</p><p>Jennifer is caught by surprise that the inhabitants she finds aren’t <em>so</em> monstrous, that she can actually stand to look at them. She may find her way to the dance floor eventually, but even still she’d promised herself not to get too messy in her time here. There’s no way she’s embarrassing herself in front of people whose normal is Jennifer’s idea of sloppiness.</p><p>She orders whatever stupid gimmick drink is at the top of the list, needing something that will actually ignite her tastebuds no matter the sugar content, and takes a seat at the bar, surveying the room. It’s quite literally the antithesis of a Washington club. Jennifer’s sure the heaviest drug done in this room is tobacco, if these people even have the gall to smoke a cigarette. They’re all so painfully boring, it nearly puts Jennifer to sleep where she sits. Though she’s far from the life of a party, she could stand to loosen her blouse and make out with a girl or two.</p><p>Just as she’s slid an unnaturally purple drink, Jennifer locks onto a form at the end of the bar. It would be impossible to ignore, the swooped bangs and striped shirt, jeans that are neither work appropriate nor fit for a club. The hunched posture was what truly gave it away, her aloof attitude would stick her out like a sore thumb in any crowd, at least in Jen’s eyes. She definitely doesn’t want to be picked out of the crowd, probably isn’t seen by anyone other than Jennifer. They’re both here for the same reason, to have a cheap drink and be on their way.</p><p>After a few minutes’ worth of staring, Jennifer’s target begins to move. Not toward the exit nor the dance floor, but to the bathroom, where Jennifer eagerly follows suit after throwing back whatever rancid, over-flavored vodka tonic she’d been served. She pushes past the sweaty bodies of dancers that she figured must be from out of town— there’s just no way this many people even exist in the city limits of Pawnee. Jenn huffs and growls at each body that she forces her way past, hating the feeling of dirty hands on such expensive fabric. She holds herself close, rolling her eyes when several people stumble over her feet.</p><p>It's with a dramatic sigh that she finally enters the bathroom. Though she doesn’t mean to be, Jennifer will always be keen on the dramatics, on making her emotions well known. Though career wise it’d be much better for her to keep a sophisticated mysteriousness such as her impervious intern, she finds it much more fun to tell people exactly what she finds annoying about them.</p><p>Jennifer primps herself in front of the mirror; makes sure the string of pearls is on straight, lays down her hair so that it stays in its barrel curls. She’s also quite the stickler for appearance, a trait that the rest of Pawnee so seems to lack. While she looks over herself in the glass, a door swings open behind her, and out emerges her raven, who, when her eyes finally lift to find Jennifer standing at the sink, stops in her tracks. It’s an adorable color on her, this shock and awe on a face so fit for lack thereof. Once again that smirk returns to Jennifer, a grin that’s so easily faked yet in this instance could not be more genuine.</p><p>“Aren’t you going to wash your hands?” Jennifer asks slyly, firmly patting the sink beside her. The younger complies, Jen watching her through the mirror as she does so. She notes the serious focus that takes the dark features, the control forced over muscles to cease a smile or a reaction of any kind. Jennifer loves it, the resistance, the denial to admit ones feelings. It’s out of her own book. It’s so intoxicating to have a cat to play with instead of yet another mouse.</p><p>“You didn’t call me.” Jennifer continues, lower lip protruding into a false pout. “Such a shame. I’ve already gotten so lonely…” She shrugs, pulls lipstick from her purse, begins to apply it liberally. Though the action forces her attention to her own visage, that of the girl beside her is not lost, still in her peripheral.  “At least tell me your name, hm?”</p><p>“April.” The shorter replies— though, she may not truly be shorter, it’s only that Jen wears five inch heels where April dons low-top converse. She finally ceases her inattentive hand washing, turns to take a paper towel. When she turns back, however, she is met by a body much closer than it had been, nearly pressing her against the wall. There’s no hiding the rush of blood to her cheeks this time. April must finally face the fact that she is truly, deeply enthralled with this woman. She has been since the first time she’d appeared on the television set spewing that nasty rhetoric about Leslie Knope, her manner of speaking so outwardly charismatic it charmed April right away.</p><p>There’s something to be said about charisma and lack thereof attracting each other.</p><p>April stutters for a moment, something she’s quite literally never done, brain seeking for something to say along the lines of <em>you’re a dick to my boss</em>, <em>I hate you</em>, but the words never come. Mostly because she doesn’t want to say them. As much as she loves Leslie, how much she wants them to win and for the woman in front of her to stop badgering their campaign on live tv, she is also wholly infatuated with the pantsuits and wicked words.</p><p>Jennifer chews her lower lip, which is still curled up into that shit-eating grin, enjoying the mess she’s turned April into far too much. She’d not dare interrupt her babbling nor her bated breathing with words of her own. The ball has now been swung into April’s court, and as greedy  as she feels to lay a kiss on those trembling lips, Jennifer wants to wait to see what her opponent swing back.</p><p>Though, instead of witty banter or biting criticism, Jennifer is met with hands on her jaw, lips on her own. She accepts it hungrily, not at all needing even a second to realize what’s happened nor to adjust to the touch. It feels all too natural, and it’s instinct that leads her hands down to slide into the back pockets of April’s jeans, her thumbs into the belt loops. What wretched material, denim. She’d hate the rough feeling on her palms were it not for the soft flesh it covered.</p><p>They’re both starving for this, tongues dancing for dominance in the other’s mouth, dark red lipstick smudged against skin that hasn’t seen this amount of makeup in quite a while. Jennifer pushes her weight into April with such fervor that she’s forced up onto the sink, the former settling between the latter’s thighs, kissing her until her back hits the cold mirror.</p><p>They each elicit soft groans out of the other, that smug smirk ever present on Jennifer’s lips when April gets too loud. Jen’s lips stray downward, down to the strong jaw, trailing her scarlet down onto the clean flesh. Her hands sneak below the woven fabric of April’s sweater, the soft skin rippling in reaction, so cold against Jen’s warm hands that is almost shocks her. Not at all in a bad way, though. It only offers more surface area in need of her kisses, desperate to be warmed by Jen’s coaxing touch.</p><p>It's that very thought that forces Jennifer backwards. She stands upright, looks at the mess of her own creation, frowns a genuine frown when April whines from the sudden lack of touch.</p><p>“Oh, baby.” Jennifer sighs, pouts more, licks her thumb and lifts it to April’s mouth, which instinctively opens to accept it, yet the thumb swerves to wipe some of the lipstick from her chin. “I’m sorry. But you know I can’t in good conscience fuck the competition. As much as I want to.” Then, she smiles, watching intently how April reacts to this news. The way her brows furrow, her hand lifts and slightly punches the sink below her in anger.</p><p>No, Jennifer certainly does not imply to stand by this rule. They’ll find themselves in this club bathroom again quite soon. But she can’t very well allow April her checkmate this early into the game. So she turns on her heels, grabs her purse, leaves with a third (certainly not final) wink over the shoulder.</p><p>“I’ll see ya!” She calls, and disappears behind swinging doors.  </p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>April hasn’t been able to stop thinking about her all week.</p><p>She hasn’t even finished a full chapter of her book, the business card still tucked between pages as a makeshift bookmark causing a flood of images to dominate April’s mind, distracting her entirely from the work of fiction. Along with said distraction, she is graced by the most embarrassing of blushes on a face that<em> never </em>does so, drawing too much attention to herself, forcing her to retreat to the bathroom to regain composure. No, she does not read the book. Yet it is seemingly surgically attached to her now, not allowing the enclosed phone number to travel any more than an inch from her fingertips at a time.</p><p>Her coworkers’ hate-fueled focus on Jennifer certainly is not helping. Everywhere April turns, there’s a video playing of Jen on another early-morning talk show, a picture of her face in the paper, with that big, toothy grin that makes April’s heart swell. To say it’s been difficult for April to fit in with this group of people so vehemently anti-Jennifer Barkley is an understatement. Though she’s never been one to share her emotions very publicly, even the smallest mention of Jen has April smiling like an idiot. Luckily, everyone around her is so consumed by their own want to win that they ignore the way April fades into the background.</p><p>It takes a full week of hopeful pining for April to muster up the confidence to finally text her.</p><p>It’s far too early in the morning, but the entire team had been called to watch Jen and Bobby discuss their campaign on <em>Pawnee Today</em>, and it’s not like April would ever give up the chance to see the woman on whom she harbors such a debilitating crush. She sits in the back of the conference room, nursing the biggest cup of coffee imaginable, hugging her book tight to her chest, which beats twenty times faster than usual. It must be the caffeine that’s given April such the adrenaline rush and enabled her fingers to send off the text message. Caffeine, and a need to see Jen— to smell that divine perfume that probably costs more than April’s entire wardrobe combined— that outweighs all of April’s typical anxiety.</p><p align="center">
  <em>what hotel are you staying at? </em>
</p><p align="left"><em> </em>She sends first. Then, after a few minutes:</p><p align="center">
  <em>in case i want to murder you in your sleep or something.</em>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Jennifer receives the texts right as she steps out of the soundstage, on the way to her car. It takes her a moment to register who it’s from, the area code far from the 202 she’s grown so used to. When it clicks in her mind, however, an immediate smile rises to her lips. Such a smile, in fact, that her idiot client asks after it, to which Jen simply responds with a bewildered eyebrow raise and a wave of the hand. She has to conceal her wild, cackling laughter until she finds the safety of her car.  <em> </em></p><p>Jen responds once she’s home, not giving in to her own excitement, wanting to force her mouse’s anticipation. She would never want to come off as desperate, even though her fingers (along with every single other ounce of her being) are furious to send a text back. She does, once it’s been a little less than an hour, giving her soon-to-be murderer the name of the hotel. No, not hotel, motel. Because why should Jen have the luxury of a warm shower and more than one pillow? Hopefully her little raven will show up at her door soon enough and save her from shag carpet and thin robes. Though, if April is soon to be the one wearing the robe, Jennifer won’t mind its thinness.</p><p>Show up she does, but only once the sun has gone down. It’s after Jen has read through all of her daily newspapers and refreshed Politico nearly a thousand times, leaving her to deal with her own boredom the way anyone outside of D.C. would. She can’t deal with Perd Hapley’s voice anymore and would quite literally rather die than listen to Pawnee public radio. So, when April appears at her door, Jen can’t conceal her relieved smile— as much as she plays it off as being coy.</p><p>“I figured you’d be bored of diner food.” April shrugs slightly, trying to hide her own smile behind sarcastic manor and feigned disinterest. She doesn’t want Jennifer to know that she’d driven all the way to Eagleton to pick up the only food within a hundred miles that could scratch the surface of Jennifer’s refined palate, but there’s something within April that’s so eager to please, so restless to hear Jen tell her she’s done something right. Though, there’s also something within her that yearns for the degradation, that so wants to be yelled at in the way that Jen yells at people she finds stupid.</p><p>“Good girl,” Jennifer purrs, subtly undoing the top buttons of her blouse as she ushers April into the room. She admires the younger woman’s outfit, for what it’s worth. Though her affinity towards skinny jeans and zipper hoodies is far from Jen’s own style, she finds the tight-fitting clothes entirely intoxicating. Jen takes her sweet time admiring the brunette, her own lower lip captured between teeth so desperate to feel skin that they’re nearly drawing blood. She leans against the end of the bed, simply to observe, to enjoy every tiny, slow movement of her opponent. Though, she can’t be all too calculating, when an absolutely divine smell tickles her nose.</p><p>“My God,” she hums, her stomach growling its approval. “I didn’t know this town was capable of good food.” Jen laughs, stepping forward to join April at the small motel desk. “Color me impressed.” She places a hand on the younger woman’s lower back, middle fingers sneakily looping through the belt loop of the black jeans, grip firm on the denim beneath. This elicits the smallest gasp from April, which she attempts to cover up with words that never fully form. She’s lost all of her typical off-putting charisma now, merely left an unthinking form of flesh that begs to be molded by Jennifer.</p><p>“It isn’t,” April finally musters, and leaves it at that. If she’s going to be so incredibly vulnerable around this woman, she’ll try her best to protect the very last bit of mystery she can conjure. Jennifer appreciates this, finds it impossibly charming, a challenge that she’s insatiably hungry for after so many hours spent on the least challenging campaign of her life.</p><p>Once they’ve plated themselves what is, to Jen at least, a meal equivalent to Jesus’ last supper, Jennifer takes a seat at the desk’s rolling chair, looks up to April with her proudest smirk.</p><p>“Only one chair.” She pouts, legs spreading a little as she gets as comfortable as possible in the degrading pleather. Jennifer stares at April with all of her might, daring the girl to stare back, to enter this arena of eye contact, but April is unable. Despite her usual menacing Kubrick stare, the moment she comes into proximity with Jennifer Barkley, April completely falls apart at the seams. It’s not something she’s ever experienced, but April is so impossibly intimidated by Jennifer, so incredibly turned on by the woman’s tempting smirk, that she barely even feels like herself anymore. It's as if her brain has been invaded, taken over, melded into something of Jennifer’s control.</p><p>April’s eyes migrate down, forcing themselves out of the magnetic pull of Jennifer’s own, looking toward the floor as is her preferred avoidant posture. Though, as she looks down to the floor, she is interrupted by a hand that moves ever so slightly against grey material. A movement so brief yet so very taunting, as if beckoning April to it. Her eyes flick back up to Jennifer’s once more, note the way her pupils have expanded, the way she pensively chews on her lip, the tautness of her lifted brows. Everything about Jennifer oozes confidence, but more so now than her usual talk show pretension. Now, she’s undone. Hair messy, shirt so unbuttoned that April can see the lace border of her bra. She’s illuminated by a single yellow lamp, not the hundreds of fluorescents that April is used to seeing her under. Jennifer is domestic now, <em>human</em>, no longer the Washington robot from the news. She is warm flesh and blood, and it’s entirely impossible for April to keep her hands away from that very warmth.</p><p>April has never known herself to be the initiator, so she finds it hard to comprehend what it is that takes over her as she straddles herself over Jennifer’s thighs and plunges her lips onto the brunette’s. It must simply be the pent-up need, the seven days she’s spent doing truly nothing other than thinking about Jennifer, fantasizing about her, praying that she might walk in through the office doors again. It is that desperation that finds April tugging on the woman’s string of pearls, kissing her so very deeply that they nearly spill out of the small chair.</p><p>April lights up with the vibration of Jennifer’s chuckle— which either comes from amusement or pure pleasure over April’s forwardness— but she is far too intoxicated by Jennifer’s perfume to even pay the short laughter any mind. Her already swimming mind is only further done in by the patchouli and bergamot that still lingers on Jennifer’s collar even the end of the day, so strong that she feels drugged, her mind’s only real thought being the one that keeps her kissing Jennifer. She kisses the older woman with such fervor that it takes all of the breath from her lungs, her eyes gone fuzzy when she eventually pulls back for air. When April realizes her own action, sees Jennifer leaned back, signature smirk of Chanel Rouge now smudged, she can’t help but apologize. She’s never wanted anything so much so that she’s taken action to get it, so she finds herself simply shocked, amazed, power hungry, yet entirely apologetic, nervous from her own wanting.</p><p>Jennifer’s own chest has begun to buzz. She had entirely expected that their chess game would take hours— that’s how long Jennifer would employ her teasing. She was ready to watch April’s walls crumble over the span of a night, not mere minutes. Yet here Jen sits, her own breath stolen from her, her grip so tight around April’s ass that her knuckles threaten to turn white. Everything within her wants to joke, to tease, to make that little pout on April’s lips remain for as long as possible, but there’s a teeny, tiny little piece of Jen that just fucking wants to kiss this girl already.</p><p>“Bed,” she says sharply, her chest still heaving a bit to fully catch up. Jennifer grins as April does just as she’s said, and though she is not too far behind, Jennifer takes a moment just so that April knows exactly who is in control of the board. Once she hears that awful squeak of the mattress, knows that April has found herself laying in the highest thread count available in Pawnee, Jennifer stands. Though it pains her to turn her back to their spread of food, her stomach growing furious at her for the betrayal, Jennifer dares not sully this moment with such a feeble need as hunger.</p><p>The vision of April laying on the bed, pupils blown out and bangs already sticking to her forehead from the lack of central air in this room, is enough to bring Jennifer to her knees. Well, not exactly to her knees. But it’s enough for her to speed up her steps, to land on the bed above April, to press a taunting kiss to her lips before pulling back, not allowing the younger woman any more than that. At least, at first. Jennifer hovers over April, hands dipping under the thin fabric of thrifted long-sleeve, holding her so tenderly. She feels so differently for April than she does the others she’s been with. In D.C., it is merely sex. Something that she is <em>very</em> good at, yes, but for the most part, something to be tossed aside once it is done. This is not at all to imply that Jennifer does not enjoy random hook-ups in club bathrooms, but it is to say that she has not felt a real affection for someone in the way that she feels for April. There is an innocence behind those huge, dark eyes that Jennifer just wants to nurture, something in the teasing attitude that Jennifer never wants to be far from.</p><p>April attempts to lift herself, to kiss Jennifer, to finally release the tension that has been building between them for far too long, but she is met by a hand on her cheek, pinning head to pillow. Jennifer is not yet ready— she wants to appreciate this for the time it will take, does not want it to become yet another body in her count. The older woman cannot help the stare with which she holds April, cannot stop her thumb from sliding across her cheek until it eventually lands in April’s mouth, who eagerly accepts it atop her tongue. The large eyes staring back, the quiet noises of April’s mouth around Jennifer’s finger— it all proves too much for Jennifer, she cannot waste any more time staring.</p><p>The brunette dips her head, and though she misses the warmth of April’s mouth when she removes her thumb, the softness of her lips replacing themselves upon Jennifer’s is apology enough. Jennifer kisses her all too greedily, not giving the younger a second before her tongue darts into the woman’s mouth, her hands lifting to cradle the sides of April’s head so that she does not shift out of the way. Jennifer’s hips begin their instinctual rocking against the scratchy material of April’s jeans, but the pencil skirt hugging her own thighs is far too restrictive for such a move. As she lifts herself to hike said skirt up to her hips, April takes the opportunity to undo the rest of the buttons of her shirt, finally releasing flesh, finally pressing her fingers to the skin beneath the silk. The touch elicits such a reaction from Jennifer that neither expected: a sharp gasp, a plunge back into kissing so feverish that a voyeur would believe these two were reconnecting after years of one being missing. This past week very well could have been a year or more, for the desperation that it has built within both April and Jennifer.</p><p>Jennifer’s hands leave April’s face, the nails that were once perfectly manicured, now horribly chipped, running over goosebumps until they land at April’s belt. She undoes the raven-haired girl’s jeans as if her most basic human function— despite having not even spoken to anyone wearing jeans in ten odd years. April’s breathing becomes halted as Jennifer’s hand slips beneath the fabric, toying gently at the fabric of her underwear, lace. As much as she’d like to tease April for it, for purchasing a new set of lingerie just for their little rendezvous, the only thing that escapes Jen’s lips is a groaning <em>‘fuck’</em> when she finally notices just how wet the underwear is.</p><p>April’s vocabulary has similarly been reduced to only curses, with the occasional <em>‘Jen— God—’ </em>moaned loudly enough she’s sure to be heard down the hallway. The latter is what sends Jennifer reeling, drunk on the way that her own name sounds coming from April’s lips. She has grown so used to <em>‘campaign manager Jennifer Barkley’</em>, that to hear such a casual nickname, something so humanizing and domestic, is so incredibly arousing to her.</p><p>April’s back begins to arch from the slightest brush of movement against her underwear, her body under touched for far too long. As Jennifer finally pulls April’s jeans around her knees, she presses kisses to her belly, then her thighs— the kisses become significantly rougher here, teeth gently grazing over the plump flesh that they find. April’s hands fling to Jennifer’s hair, the perfectly set coif of curls now falling loose at her shoulders, April’s overwhelmed tugging not doing much for the style’s stability.</p><p>It's the harshest of all of April’s tugs that finally has Jennifer pushing the underwear to the side, slipping two fingers into the woman’s cunt. The action forces the loudest of April’s moans, a volume so rarely met by April’s vocal cords, yet in Jen’s presence, becoming all too common. The sweet moans are downright obscene, so very dirty that Jennifer can barely keep her head on her own shoulders. Her kisses to April’s stomach have become sloppy; she’s practically drooling all over the younger woman. Jennifer’s hips have continued their feverish rocking by now, and though April can barely conceive a thought beyond Jennifer’s name, she is just lucid enough to kick up her leg, pressing her thigh firmly into the politician’s clothed cunt. The contact sends white-hot pleasure coursing through Jennifer, but it is more April’s own pleasure which Jennifer seeks. Her free hand holds firm around the girl’s thin hips, holding her off of the bed so that her pumping may hit the perfect spot, may elicit more of those salacious moans from lips that begged to be kissed.</p><p>Jennifer greedily returns to said lips, her own grown swollen and over-hydrated from fervent caressing that they sting when April takes them between her teeth. The pain is more than welcome, as is the way that April’s hands force up Jennifer’s shirt, her nails clawing down skin. They are both sure to be covered in purple bruises come morning. Jennifer revels in the very thought that April will have to see Jennifer’s staked claim each time she gets dressed, that she will blush at the very sight of herself in the mirror, will get hot and bothered all over again before the workday has even started.</p><p>April has gone nearly breathless, her body tense in Jennifer’s grasp. She would not be surprised if her jocular threat of death were to become real. The way that Jen’s thumb lightly strikes her clit and then recedes, teasing, proving that Jennifer is still the one in control, sends a shiver through April. This sends her body only closer into Jennifer’s arms, who greedily accepts this nearness, for someone who has quite literally pushed away every single person that has attempted so much as a hug. She can feel herself being so corrupted by April, her very nature being distorted, becoming humanized, becoming <em>tender. </em>It sickens Jennifer, but she cannot possibly focus on her own morality when there is such a beautiful woman riding her fingers.</p><p>April’s muscles have gone tense, are threatening to cramp from how tightly she holds Jen between her thighs. Jennifer finally relents, allows April the pleasure she’s begun begging for, presses her thumb firmly to April’s clit. What soft groans were once pleading are now simply pathetic from pleasure, all caution for privacy thrown to the wind. Jennifer’s kisses have moved to April’s jaw, sure to leave her territorial markings there, and as her position allows, she whispers soft, teasing degradations about just how naughty the rest of the motel’s occupants must find her. <em>Everyone will know how good I make you feel</em>, she reminds the raven countless times, her laughter dark against April’s ear, her tongue sliding along sharp jaw.</p><p>April’s fingers nearly rip Jennifer’s shirt when the pleasure in her stomach finally builds up so much that she cannot take it anymore. She grips onto the silk as if for dear life, squeezes her thighs around Jennifer’s own so tightly that neither woman can move very much.</p><p>“Good girl.” Jennifer repeats, her head still nuzzled into the mess of hair in the crook of April’s neck, her hand’s movements unrelenting so that April becomes ever so slightly overstimulated. Jen doesn’t want to overdo it, she’s sure this is the first time April’s been fucked in years. At least this well.</p><p> “I can’t see why you would possibly want to stay here tonight… But I’d like you to.” Jennifer grins as the two slowly return to normal breathing. She gently pushes the hair from April’s face, pulling her hand to her mouth, staring deep into April’s blown out pupils as she indulgently accepts the dripping fingers onto her own tongue.</p><p>“I’ll stay…” The younger stutters. April’s voice has gone weak, and has dropped back to its typical nonchalant cadence. Though there is no nonchalance in the way her voice shakes, in the lack of air in her lungs, in the way her hips still rock slightly against Jennifer.</p><p>Jennifer takes a moment to admire what she’s made of April. She laughs softly to herself, remembering just how stoic and timid April had once looked behind her office desk. The laughter causes concern to wash over the younger woman’s features, but as Jennifer buttons her shirt back up, she leans forward to press a gentle kiss to April’s lips, dissipating the fear entirely. She can feel something in the pit of her stomach telling her not to get attached, that she’ll only be here for a while and there’s just no way that a young girl like this would want to move her entire life to another state. She wouldn’t to get April caught up in the world of Washington. And yet, here she is, feeling incredibly dedicated to April, so very enthralled by that slanted smile and slightly baffled knitted brows.</p><p>As difficult as it is for her to get up—physically, because April is still wrapped around her body like a python— Jennifer slides out of the bed, into her slippers, walks toward the bathroom.</p><p>“C’mon baby,” she hums, barely tossing a glance over her shoulder. “We’re not done.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>April has to physically silence herself when they pull up to the Newport mansion, when she sees the brunette standing at the podium, looking so official and well kempt and so unbelievably sexy, even with the mournful half-frown on her dark lips. It’s really all she can do not to start laughing, to stop her own smiling while the rest of the bus around her turns into a mad panic. She has been barely paying attention all day, hasn’t looked up from her mindless doodling nor taken her headphones out once. Even when Leslie asked specifically for her advice, April was of absolutely no help. She’s only really thought about Jen, about how badly she wants to text the woman, but does not want to seem clingy. Though, it’s impossible not to seem clingy when she’s spent nearly every night for the past week in Jennifer’s hotel room.</p><p>Needless to say, when the entire bus’s worth of Parks employees fall into Jennifer’s trap, April is all too pleased.</p><p>April avoids the madness and confusion of the situation, follows the rest of the more nonconfrontational members of the team deep into the mansion, hoping that by some act of God, Jennifer had seen her, and followed her in.</p><p>April wanders aimlessly through the giant house— well, not entirely aimlessly. There is a particular pearl-wearing politician whom she seeks, but she plays off her searching glances well. The house is egregiously massive, April can’t even believe this kind of place exists in Pawnee. She’s must have walked through about twenty rooms by now, slamming her palm down on several pianos just because she can, laughing at all of the paintings of the creepy old dead guy, and stealing bits of stale candy from every open jar she finds. Of which there are too many. </p><p>After about half an hour of exploring, not seeing a single other person in the meantime, April becomes exhausted. Like she’s been shuffling around a museum of candy wrappers and bizarrely descriptive nude portraits, all in the decorative style of a teenage boy that hasn’t grown out of his Xbox phase yet. She finds herself in a long dining room, one that probably hasn’t hosted a family dinner in far too long. She decides to take a seat, that Leslie will find her if she needs to. Or maybe they’ll just forget about her and April can move into this house and swim in their pool whenever she wants. It’s not like anyone will notice.</p><p>Except, one person has noticed her. She’s been hunted, tracked, preyed upon, all without knowing. Jennifer has been following her, all hidden behind April’s blaring headphones.</p><p>“Well… look who it is.” Comes the teasing voice of her huntress, sly and teasing and naughty and just the thing that April’s ears have been missing.</p><p>April snaps her head up, big, dumb, slanted smile already slapped across her lips when she does so. She forgets all about the game on her phone, pulls out the headphones that play some soft rock song that April immediately forgets the name of. She’s kicked her feet up on the table—nobody is going to eat here for another century, why should she care about cleanliness? — but sits upright the moment she locks eyes with Jennifer.</p><p>“How the hell did you find me in here? This place is a maze.” April questions, fighting the urge to stand and skip over to Jennifer and hold her hand and do all of the stupid dumb girlfriend-y things she so deeply desires to do.</p><p>“I have my ways.” Jennifer replies, coyly as ever, and winks in April’s direction. She’s grown closer to April, now leans against the long table. She looks significantly frazzled; hair frizzy from the heat of her thoughts, her shirt unbuttoned a little under halfway, string of pearls gone because she probably felt as though they were choking her. Though, Jennifer only dressed herself down once she was within April’s earshot, would never let anyone see her this disheveled other than her favorite intern.</p><p>“You know…” Jennifer smiles, sauntering ever closer to April until she lands right in front of her, places a hand on the younger woman’s chin, lifts up her gaze, which is already boring into Jennifer so intensely that the action is of no purpose. “There are thirty bedrooms in this house. There’s a dead guy in one, Bobby’s in another… But the rest are free.” She accentuates the words with a quick kiss to April’s lips, who immediately stands up, perhaps a little too eagerly.</p><p>“Yes please.” Is all she can say before the two are rushing out of the room, April unzipping her jacket frantically, feeling incredibly giddy at the thought of such a taboo rendezvous. Not only are they doing such a thing while on the clock, while in someone else’s house, but the very fact that so many people from the Knope team walk these halls is exhilarating. She wants so badly to show off her hot new piece of ass, that she’s won over the very woman that hates everyone in the entire town, that the hotshot D.C. lady has fallen for the jaded Pawnee no name. April hopes that they’ll get caught.</p><p>“Wait, wait…” April stops dead in her tracks, tugs an exasperated Jen back until they face each other, holding both hands. Jennifer shoots her a quizzical look, lips pursed, the way that makes April go completely and entirely insane, so much so that she nearly forgets what she was going to say. Then: “Is there really a dead guy in this house? I wanna see him.”</p><p>April’s deadpan delivery, paired with toothy smile and glimmering, wide eyes, makes Jennifer laugh far too loudly. So loudly, in fact, that she can hear someone call her name from another room, someone looking for her. But she won’t be found.</p><p><br />“God, you’re weird.” Jennifer replies with yet another stolen kiss, before tugging April into whatever bedroom they stand outside of. She, of course, means the word <em>weird </em>as a term of endearment, comparable to <em>adorable</em> or <em>perfect</em>, and this is exactly how April accepts it. They are the television’s most exuberant woman and her little weirdo, the perfect yin and yang.</p><p>Once Jennifer checks that there are no reporters hiding out or incompetent Parks employees to interrupt them, she’s all over April. They’ve only just left each other this morning; April had to leave quite early to get on the campaign bus and Jennifer, of course, rose early just to send her off, but even the few hours were too much time spent apart. <em>How gross</em>, Jennifer thinks to herself, that she’s <em>fallen for someone. Eugh. </em>It’s so unlike her, so cheesy Hallmark channel movie, to be so fond of someone, yet here she is, hands all over April, hands kneading into receiving flesh like they’re meant to be together.</p><p>Jennifer is sure to lock the door in between heavy kisses, and though she is typically wholly averse to putting herself anywhere near sheets that she does not know the cleanliness of, she cannot resist pushing April into the bed and crawling on top of her. They continue their sloppy kisses, as if every time they see each other is merely an extension of the last time, picking up right where they left off. And if memory serves Jennifer correctly, where they left off was nearly identical to this, though… they were significantly less clothed. So, she quickly works to rid April of the bright yellow jeans which, on anyone else, would be horribly garish, yet work incredibly well for April. </p><p>Though, this action motivates something unlike their last meeting.</p><p>April wraps both legs around Jennifer, pushing with all of her poorly nourished might so that she flips them both over, hovering on top of Jennifer, proud smirk too prominent across her features. Jennifer, who is at first entirely shocked, curious at the sudden change in power, falls too quickly submissive below April than she’d like. Perhaps it has been the stress of the day that’s left her motionless beneath April’s quickfire unbuttoning fingers, or the way that the raven-haired intern so gently pushes the hair out of her face, but Jen is all too appreciative of April’s choice.</p><p>That is, until her eyes scan too low on the woman’s chest.</p><p>“Oh, Jesus,” Jen groans, rolling her eyes dramatically, looking up at April with a frown. “You’ve gotta take that off, baby.” She points to the oversized button pinned to April’s jacket, of Leslie Knope’s overeager smile. To say that she’s jealous is the understatement of the year, but Jennifer Barkley doesn’t <em>do</em> jealous. Territorial, sure. Mean, absolutely. But jealous? No way.</p><p>Not until now. The relief she feels when April ditches the jacket altogether forces a weight off of Jen’s chest that she wouldn’t have felt had jealousy not been a factor.</p><p>“I hate that—” Jen begins, though she has to stifle a moan when April’s soft tongue glides across her jaw. “— you work for her.”</p><p>April pauses for a moment but quickly shakes her head, undoing the rest of Jennifer’s buttons and sneakily unclasping her bra when her back arches from a deliberately placed kiss to Jen’s neck.</p><p>“I barely work for her. They don’t notice I’m there half the time.” April replies, voice impossibly low, vibrating against Jennifer’s neck, her hands gently groping the woman’s chest, eliciting more of those staggered moans that she so enjoys. April has found Jennifer to be quite the muted woman, at least in their now shared hotel room. Though she is nothing less than gaudy to camera, behind closed doors, Jennifer is almost shy. Thus, April has taken it upon herself to turn Jennifer into the noisy mess that she so desires, and she figures that their semi-public affair may be the perfect place to do just that.</p><p>April’s touch is gentle, yet thoughtful in its motions, fingers just teasing Jennifer’s nipple enough to shut up whatever next work-related complaint Jennifer is about to make. Though April finds Jen’s passion for her work incredibly attractive, she also finds it to be all the older woman can think about. She just wants to give Jennifer one moment of her day in which she can think of something other than politics. So, she decides to fill the air with something else, since she knows that despite the way Jen’s back arches off the bed, her brain is still racing with thoughts about campaign problems and how to solve them.</p><p>“Plus, the campaign will be over in a week, and then we’ll both be in D.C., far away from this mess.”</p><p>She hadn’t meant to say that last part.</p><p>April pauses for a moment, looks up to Jennifer, whose eyes have snapped open, and is now staring April down with another patented Jen Barkley inquisitive stare.</p><p>“I mean… I…” April tries to cover for herself, sitting upright and splaying her palms out across Jennifer’s stomach, too scared to look up and meet Jennifer’s eye contact. Her gaze is stuck downward, that is until that strong hand once again forces her chin upwards, locking their eyes.</p><p>“You know how Ben is moving to D.C. to work on that congressional campaign?” April starts trepidatiously, her voice a little bit shaky, any previous confidence she held now completely shattered, her toes wiggling in her shoes from nervousness. “He uh… He invited me to go with him. To be his intern, or whatever…” As much as she tries to look anywhere else, April must tune her gaze back to Jennifer, to try and pick up on the unmoving facial features, any significant twitch of the lip or lowered eyebrow. Though, Jennifer has mastered her own features, will not let them move from the expression she wants to portray.</p><p>“I hope that’s not… too much for you.” April begins to ramble again, her usual awkward silence magically gone the moment she feels any sort of pressure. No, now she’s all words. “I just... He invited me and… I really want to get out of Pawnee, there’s just like… nothing for me here…” April can feel herself turning inward with every second that Jennifer spends in silence, but it is far from a negative quiet.</p><p>Jennifer, though she looks incredibly so, is not mad. In fact, she is trying to bottle her own excitement. In all honesty, she was planning to invite April to return to Washington with her, anyway, but was terrified that she’d find it too boring, that she’d find Jen herself too boring. That there’s nothing for anyone outside of the political sphere in D.C., that April doesn’t feel the same connection, that they aren’t more than a month-long fling.</p><p>“That’s not too much for me.” Jennifer replies all too swiftly, feeling more genuine with those words than she has really ever felt saying anything in her life. She feels speechless, a bit dumbfounded, like she has finally been given a run for her money. She didn’t want to admit to herself how badly she yearns for the downright corny imagined vignettes of spending holidays and lazy weekends with April, but here she is, having to face her own wanting.</p><p>Jennifer’s grasp around April’s hips has grown softer, her face equally softening into a less perplexed expression, though she still chews on the fat inside of her cheeks, still unbelievably nervous at the prospect of having a long-term relationship.</p><p>“You won’t even see me, I mean…” April feels a bit outside of herself, becoming this over-explaining explosion of words, where she has spent the entirety of her morning nonverbal. “I’m sure you’ll be busy, and I don’t know what I’ll be doing but, I mean, it probably won’t be a lot, but I don’t know, our paths will probably never cross…”</p><p>Her anxious stream of consciousness is abruptly ended when Jennifer sits up, grabs April’s face between both hands, kisses her so deeply that the line of thinking ends entirely. April is astonished by how quickly the voices in her head silence, by how easily her thoughts are replaced by Jennifer. The two kiss each other with the slowness of two women who have finally confronted their deeper feelings for one another, far more gently than their previous illicit affairs. And, while April would still prefer a verbal confirmation that what she is doing is wanted, that she isn’t crossing any boundaries, these adoring kisses are approval enough.</p><p>Jennifer is the one to pull back first, to lay her head on April’s chest, and for the first time, she is the one to avoid eye contact.</p><p>“I want our paths to cross.” She sighs softly, fingers looping through the loops of April’s jeans as they are so prone to doing, allowing herself to sink into the woman, to rise and fall with April’s chest. “You could stay with me, even. If you wanted. It’s a nice house, especially by Pawnee standards.”</p><p>April laughs softly, leans forward, lifts Jennifer’s chin up, is the one to force the connection this time.</p><p>“I’d really like that,” the younger says, once again pushing hair from Jennifer’s face, her fingers light and delicate in their touch. Then, quite suddenly, she drops her hands (though they don’t stray far, and only fall to Jennifer’s shoulders), looks around, returns to the human world outside of her amorous bubble of Jennifer. “This is a very strange place to have this conversation.” April laughs, and so does Jen, and it’s incredibly quickly that their bubble forms around them all over again, ignoring whatever noise they hear down the hall, whatever professional duties they may have.</p><p>April’s hands slide down shoulders until they return to Jennifer’s chest, pushing ever so slightly until they both lay down again, their hot kisses returning, April’s tongue the one fighting for dominance, her teeth gently biting Jen’s lower lip. She’s never been one to <em>dominate</em>, not in bed and certainly not in her day-to-day life. But something about seeing Jennifer so stressed out, so overwrought from work and life, makes April want to make her feel good. To take away that worry and the pain and just let Jennifer relax, something that she’s not so sure the brunette is capable of in the first place, but she will try.</p><p>Now, is a dead man’s candy mansion exactly the perfect place to unwind? No, definitely not. But April doesn’t pay it any attention, can only focus on the way that Jen completely unravels in only a heartbeat when April finds the zipper of her skirt, pushes it down only a little. Only enough to slide her hand below the waistline, no more. She won’t very well have Jennifer completely undress in a bed that isn’t her own.</p><p>April is quick to slide her hand beneath Jennifer’s underwear, pulling the most obscene moan from the woman, who has clearly been waiting all too impatiently for just this. April almost giggles from the lewd way that Jennifer acts, but stops herself with a small groan of her own when she slips two fingers into the woman, curving into her flesh, and is rewarded with a small string of curses.</p><p>Curses that are far too loud, April can tell, but if her goal was to see just how loud she could get Jennifer, it’s one that’s definitely been accomplished.</p><p>And louder she gets, back lifting off the bed and hands flying to the pillow behind her, riding April’s fingers so greedily, the bed beginning to creak below them. April has to be the one to pin Jennifer’s hips to the bed with her free hand, which takes nearly all of her very minimal strength. She feels so dirty, fully clothed and watching how needy Jennifer’s hips are to rock against her fingers. God, it makes April feel so hot. She’s certainly soaked through her own underwear just watching Jennifer like this, grown high from the mere sound of Jennifer’s moans.</p><p>The moans that have gotten so obscenely loud that April has to lean down and kiss her just to shut her up, but it isn’t much help.</p><p>April cannot help but laugh into the kisses, her fingers slowly pick up their speed, the warm wetness spilling around them sure to leave some sort of mark on the bed when they’re done. April cannot help herself, must straddle Jennifer’s thigh, both to keep Jen from her desperate bucking and so that she may rock against the woman’s thigh ever so slightly, though it is Jennifer’s pleasure that is getting April off already. She can feel Jennifer tighten around her fingers, can feel the muscles in her abdomen tense up. She is close, but—</p><p>A knock at the door.</p><p>Both Jennifer and April freeze, though Jen’s hips continue to thrust upwards into April’s fingers, still seeking pleasure despite the absolute horror that has come over her.</p><p>“Is […] in there…” They can’t really hear the voice from the other side of the door, but it’s certainly masculine. April prays it isn’t a member of the Parks department, that it’s just some reporter that got lost. Though deep down, she is incredibly aware of their volume that they’ve drawn far too much attention to themselves for what should have been a quickie gone unnoticed.</p><p>The voice drowns out, and slowly, April’s attention returns to Jennifer, who has begun her belabored groaning all over again, causing a hand to be slapped over her mouth, an amused grin on April’s own. She wants to laugh, because this situation they’ve found themselves in is just so incredibly comedic, yet intoxicatingly arousing. She does laugh, when Jen begins kissing her hand sloppily, seemingly always determined to fuck with April despite being the quite literally getting fucked.</p><p>April’s laugh must be loud enough to arouse the suspicions of their spy, for the doorknob jiggles, and the voice says something— then another voice perks into a conversation. April shuts her mouth tight, keeps the palm clasped over Jennifer’s firm, as Jennifer reaches her climax, be it from the jerking of her hips or the exhilaration of being caught, she simply cannot keep herself together. She can only whine against April’s hand, her own gripping so tightly into the bedspread below her that she threatens to rip it. Though she is still distracted by the voices outside, April is watching Jennifer so intensely, she wouldn’t dare miss this view, no matter the consequences. Jennifer’s face and chest is flushed bright red, her pupils blown out and lashes heavy, heavier than usual. She looks as though she’s just returned from the gym, sweaty and exhausted and chest heaving, yet blissful. Like she’s calmed since the first time in too many years.</p><p>Funny, April thinks, that she looks so calm, where there isn’t even a hint of stillness in April’s brain. She can’t even begin to imagine what sort of reaction she would receive, that both of them would receive, for sleeping with the enemy. It’s not like April really cares <em>that</em> much, she’ll be gone from the Parks department in about a week, and it’s not like she cares about these people’s opinions that much. Maybe Ron’s, or Leslie’s. Definitely not Anne’s. These people will be 500 miles away from her soon enough, so though her heart may be racing at this moment, it’s not as though there’s a lot of long-term stress that this will create.</p><p>April does all she can to soothe Jennifer, who now seems to be a little more awake, is looking up at April with a wild stare, eyes wide in register of what has just happened. She’s never one let herself get so… <em>horny</em>. She’s had plenty of sex in broom closets and on office desks late at night, but never once has she devolved into such a pleasure-hungry being that she’s nearly created a fool of herself. She’s embarrassed, hides her head in her hands for a moment, then drops them, lets them fall to April’s thighs.</p><p>“Jesus.” Jennifer smiles, but quickly shuts up to listen through the door. When she doesn’t hear anything, she continues speaking. “I’ll leave first, you stay here for a few minutes.” She sighs, beginning to button up her shirt, tossing her hair to the side as if it will bring back her professional aura. Though, the smudged mascara and wrinkled blazer do nothing to conceal her sensuality.</p><p>April nods, not at all wanting to accept this defeat, that they have to go their separate ways, that she won’t get to spend the next hours with her head buried between Jennifer’s thighs, that she has to return to the campaign bus. What a shame.</p><p>Both women get re-dressed, April finding her jacket that was tossed aside so haphazardly, Jennifer patting at her makeup in the vintage vanity by the window. Once both are sure that they’re safe to leave, Jennifer presses a gentle kiss to April’s cheek, slaps her ass.</p><p>“I’ll see you tonight?” She sings, once one foot is out the door, and does not wait for an answer. She already knows what it is.</p><p>Once April thinks she’s waited long, that there’s surely no one outside, that they’ve spent enough time in this mansion to warrant departure, she finds her way back down the marble staircase, back outside into fresh air, finds her team.</p><p>“You get lost?” Donna calls when April joins the group, eyebrow raised inquisitively.</p><p>“Yeah, something like that.” April replies, nervously toying with her jacket, readjusting her outfit far too many times to come off as relaxed. When they step back onto the campaign bus, Donna sits across from her, face wearing a smirk of knowing, of accusation, but not of blame.</p><p>“Are you wearing lipstick?” She asks, voice low enough so that their conversation is not heard by anyone else.</p><p>“What? No! Shut… shut up.” April blushes deeply, eyes flittering around the bus, raising the sleeve of her jacket to wipe at her mouth, but also to conceal the smile that raises to red-stained lips. Donna does not indict any further, only nods, allows April her secret.</p><p>As the bus pulls out the driveway and onto their next location, a ding comes from April’s phone.</p><p>When she opens it, it is a ridiculously vulgar selfie, one that forces the intern to slam her phone down on the seat beside her so quickly that the entire bus of heads turn to stare at her. Thank God she’s always been the <em>weird girl</em> of the bunch, and can pass this sort of action off with a shrug and a bewildered look of her own, as if to say <em>What? I didn’t do anything. You’re the weird ones. </em></p><p>April is unable to focus for the rest of the day, staring at the photo she’s been sent each time she gets a moment of privacy. She is practically bouncing off of the walls by the time she is let go for the night, so thirsty for Jennifer, itching with so much desire that she cannot possibly drive to the woman’s hotel room fast enough.</p>
