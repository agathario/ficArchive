<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Agatha tapped her fingers against her steering wheel as the houses rushed by in the foggy weather. She yawned and took a sip of her coffee, shaking her head and grumbling to herself before parking the car and stepping out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She slammed the door shut and picked up her coffee and work bag, making her way inside the station. The environment was different than usual. Bustling. Busy. Pheromones all over the place. Something was happening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her boss, Lilia, made her way over to her. “You’re late,” she simply stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you’ve got a stain on your blouse,” she sneered before making her way into the meeting room as Lilia followed behind her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Listen, Agatha,” she started. “We’ve had something pretty big happen overnight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So have I,” she responded. “Have you ever had two six year old boys round at your house for a sleepover with your son? Cause I have now. It’s not pretty.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We have a connection to the case,” Lilia spoke. “The Salem Seven.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. A ruthless gang full of drug trafficking and assassinations. She’d been trying to take them down for years. But to no avail that was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’re holding someone in a cell right now. Down in the prison nearby,” she said, following Agatha through the precinct. “One of their best assassins.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Best assassins?” Agatha scoffed. “Can’t be that good if they’re already caught.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She came here by choice,” she said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha paused for an uncomfortable moment. “Huh. Weird.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” she said. “But she has the information we need. The connections and ties-.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What does she want?” Agatha interrupted him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stopped. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She snorted. “With cases like these, there’s always a reason, a motive. She didn’t just hand herself in for the shits and giggles. She wants something, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia sighed. “Always one step ahead, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She chuckled before Lilia placed the file on her desk. “Rio Vidal. Late 30s. Hispanic. Also goes by the name “Lady Death.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hardly humble. Ranking?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alpha,” she said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head in surprise. “That explains it. A female alpha? Rare aren’t they? We’ve got a sparkly little case on our hands.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s murdered over 100 people, Agatha,” a voice said from behind. Agatha rolled her eyes. Jen. Yet another beta. Her arch enemy. Her son told her it was silly to have an arch enemy but she continued with her constant bickering with the woman anyway. “I wouldn’t exactly call her sparkly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good to see you too, Kale,” Agatha sneered as she stepped into the meeting room, eventually followed by Alice, a newer recruit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where have you both been?” Lilia asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You told us to be here at 9,” Alice stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I did?” Lilia questioned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. She hadn’t exactly pictured her future being working undercover with a small team of rejects trying to take down some high profile gang, but here she was. Working with a cooky hag, a cranky bitch and some emo. At least her criminology degree was useful somehow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The two sat down in the briefing room with them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, Lady Death?” Jen questioned. “She’s caused quite a scene has she not?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia nodded. “She came here last night asking for…” She stopped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Asking for what?” Agatha snapped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Asking for you,” she said after a moment of hesitation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ohh,” Jen chanted. “Looks like the serial killer’s got a thing for Detective Harkness.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you mean?” Agatha asked Lilia, not paying attention to Jen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia blinked. “I was hoping you’d be able to answer that yourself. Do you have a connection to her? Have you met before?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gritted her teeth, trying to rack her brain to remember. Nothing. She sighed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No. Nothing. You sure no one else can do this?” She asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s refusing to communicate with anyone else.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine. Can I see her?”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The cells were dark and dingy. Awfully stereotypical but Agatha wasn’t one to judge. The drive was around an hour from the station, which she’d had to make on her own. A man met her at the front door and the two made their way through the prison sections.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’d like to make sure you hold no weapons or phones while you’re here,” he said as he ran a defector across her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’ll, I’ve got nothing to hide,” she said as he checked her. “So… for such a high profile criminal I’m surprised your holding her in a mixed rank general prison.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He chucked as they walked. “Considering she surrendered herself yesterday, we didn’t exactly have much of a choice at the time. She’s being transferred to an alpha only prison for more… serious crimes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “And she didn’t mention why she wanted me specifically?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He shook his head before stopping at a room near the back, separated by two rooms, guarded by two prison officers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She narrowed her eyes. “You sure this is necessary?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He nodded. “Very sure. We don’t like to take risks.” He paused at the door. “You’ll be talking to her with just one guard but I can assure you you are very protected. We have cameras in the room as well as another guard on the other side.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha chucked. “I'm sure I’ll be fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He nodded, opened the door and guided her to her seat. She sat down and paid no attention as he left, running a hand through her hair. She opened her notebook and flipped to a new page.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was the sound of a buzz and a door open. There she was. Rio Vidal. In orange prison wear and tight handcuffs. She had dark brown eyes and slightly unkempt brunette hair. Agatha assumed it was from being in prison. She stared at Agatha with an unreadable expression. Agatha stilled nervously, hoping she didn’t notice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The guards pushed her over to the table to Agatha. Rio stumbled over the heavy chains that dragged her to the floor, sending scraping sounds across the room. She took a seat and waited expectantly at the guards. They left.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hummed in satisfaction before turning her attention to Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ve missed you,” she smiled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who are you?” Agatha instantly responded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed. “You really don’t recognise me?” Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “Fine. What does your little file say about me?” She tilted her head to the file, unable to use her hands to gesture.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at the file on the table. “This isn’t your first gig. You mainly prey on men. Don’t go after a particular rank. You kill without mercy. You're nicknamed “Lady Death.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, throwing her head back in delight. “Lady Death? They still use that for me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip. “I’ve been told you turned yourself in.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s right,” Rio smirked. “I’ve been waiting all night. Just for you. You should know it gets so lonely here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at the guard still in the room. Rio’s smirk shifted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are you looking at him?” She questioned with a frown. “Look at me!” Her voice raised slightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She could smell it. The alpha pheromones coming through. Rio didn’t want the other alpha here. She wanted just them. Agatha chewed at her lip, knowing the pheromones were messing with her head, making her submissive.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Fuck. She hated being an omega. She still remembers the look of disappointment her mother gave her the day she presented. She came from a family of mainly betas and alphas. Yet another disappointment she brought to the family name.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She looked over to the guard and gestured for him to leave.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you sure?” He asked, noticing the change in scents as he attempted to assert more dominance but to no use.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He nodded and left them alone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back grinning wildly. “Thank God. It was starting to feel sick from the smell of him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why’d you request me?” Agatha snapped, bringing the conversation back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a faux offended look before tilting her head. “Here I thought you’d want to see me again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brow furrowed. “Why would I…?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If not you then at least Nicky.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That’s what got her. Agatha froze. The hairs on the back of her neck stood. She didn’t know what to do. She glanced at the cameras before looking back at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How do you—?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know more than you think,” Rio responded with a shrug. “Or at least that you're aware of right now, Detective Harkness.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you want with him?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled. “Nothing. I’ve done shit but I’m not about to kill a child. I'm not a monster.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know what you are,” Agatha responded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio groaned in what looked like frustration. She leaned back against the chair and rolled her eyes back before leaning forward again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ve been watching you know,” she stated. Agatha gripped her notebook. “For all these past six years. Watching both of you. My boss told me to keep my distance but I’ve hardly been able to stay away from you. It’s not like I'd ever forget you. Your touch. How you felt wrapped around me. How you’d come undone-.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Stop it!” Agatha commanded before she glanced at the cameras worriedly. She still had no clue what the smug alpha was talking about. Rio watched her gaze and decided to take a different approach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you still friends with Wanda?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Aren’t I supposed to be asking the questions here?” Agatha snapped, unnerved at more information the criminal knew.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It was her party we met at,” Rio stated. “You wore a purple dress. Very sexy. I was there for a kill. Can’t remember who it was now. I remember you. Do you remember that night? We met at the bar. I ordered a beer and you ordered some fruity cocktail. Do you remember what happened next?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt herself burning up. Now she remembered. She should have recognised that stupid smug look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio Vidal. The cocky alpha at the party. They’d met over drinks and Agatha had instantly been won over by her charm and confidence. They talked. About everything and nothing. Then Rio took her to the hotel she’d been staying at. They had sex. Multiple rounds if Agatha remembered correctly. Then a few weeks later she was pregnant with her son.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She froze.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sitting in front of her was the father of her child. The serial killer and assassin. Lady Death. Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Fuck.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha backed away. “I can’t…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio whined. “Don’t leave me, baby. I’ve just found you. I wanna help you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bullshit,” she scoffed, packing up her file and notebook.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay, now you’re just being mean,” Rio snarked. “Please don’t go. It’s so boring here. The food tastes like shit. The other alphas here stink. We have to be caged up during our ruts.” She grinned. “I’m just glad I won’t be here for mine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha halted. “What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio froze. She realised she messed up. “Cause I’m switching prisons. I know that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha made her way back over to the younger woman. “No you didn’t. All prisons have the same precautions for cycles. You meant something else…” Her eyes widened as Rio let out a defeated sigh. “You’re planning to get out of here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio bit her lip and chuckled. “What? Can’t blame a girl for trying.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha walked back to the door, knocking on it to open. The guard came in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Interrogation went well,” she stated. “Prisoner is planning to break out within a few days.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes widened and stood up. “No. I’m not. Stop it. She’s lying!” She growled angrily at the older woman. The guards ran up to her, quickly holding her down. “Wait. Fuck. Not the needle. Please.” Her consciousness faded as she took one last look at Agatha. “I’m not done with you. You might not want me now. But all in good time, baby.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She slumped down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s ragged breathing slowed and she stormed out of the room. She was met with the same man again. She marched past him. “Consider this a failure. You can count me out of this case.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Detective, please,” he begged, rushing after her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She shushed him, collecting her phone and gun at the office before getting back in her car and drove back to the station.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Officer Proctor said you fled the building,” Lilia said as soon as Agatha arrived back in the building. “You can’t do that, Agatha. We have to stay professional.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned. “Oh my God. I really don’t wanna hear anything about being professional right now.” She sat down at her desk, massaging her temples. “Oh God.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Heyy, how did the case go?” A voice said from behind her. She groaned. Billy. The newest recruit. The boy she was supposed to train.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine,” she snapped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, what’s going on?” Lilia demanded, slightly unnerved now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed and chewed at her lip. “Alright. You wanna know.” She looked back at Billy and gave him a warning look for him to leave. “Turns out I knew… the person.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio Vidal,” Lilia clarified.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She nodded. “I didn’t realise who she was. However, she definitely recognised me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t like where this is going.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uhh turns out around six years ago we hooked up at a terribly mediocre party and conceived a child together,” she rushed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Another voice shrieked. She looked back to see Jen who’d up until now had kept rather quiet. Alice sat next to her, going through some files.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course you're here,” Agatha snorted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You fucked a criminal?” She asked, ignoring her sass.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“From the sounds of the story, I think the criminal fucked Agatha,” Alice corrected her, before turning her attention back to her file.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thanks, Alice,” Agatha snorted. “Really needed your input.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hold on,” Lilia interrupted. “Agatha, are you kidding me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Agatha scoffed, throwing her hands up. “It’s not like I knew she was a serial killer at the time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Was she at least hot?” Jen asked with a smirk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jen!” Lilia hissed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Jen defended. “It’s a good question.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Look up “Lady Death,” Alice instructed. “It has a few pictures of her. Although with her disguse.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen quickly typed away on her laptop. “Oof. Yeah. I totally see it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes. Before interviewing Rio, she’d done a quick look through the file but had no time to go on any other sites.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wait, let me see,” Agatha demanded, scooting over to get a view.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The pictures were blurry. Mainly CCTV footage and recordings from old phones but you could see the overall figure. She wore a tight body suit with a hood, welded a dagger and wore a face painted like a grim reaper. The name definitely lived up to it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So did you do it with her in the costume?” Jen asked curiously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If I did, I’d think I know who she was,” Agatha scoffed, slamming the laptop lid shut, making Jen jump.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha then took a seat, softly laying her head on her hands, groaning in exhaustion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You alright?” Alice asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not really the time to ask that, Gulliver,” Agatha sneered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So it’s confirmed then,” Lilia questioned. “She’s Nicky’s father. You weren’t with anyone else? There’s not a chance of it—?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, cause I love a good hookup,” Agatha laughed. “I don’t know what to do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We can move you two to a safe house if—,” Lilia started but was cut off again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I doubt it needs to be taken to that,” Agatha stated. “I’ve already warned the guards of her intentions. She’s being moved to a high security prison.” She glanced at the clock. Her shift was over. “Ah. Looks like my shift is over. Well, it was lovely seeing you ladies. But I think I’ll be gone for a while. Gonna live off the grid with Nicky or something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen sighed. “Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No no, it’s all fine. Just great,” she said. “Actually, I’ve gotta pick him up from soccer right now so…” She picked up her things and gave one last look to Lilia. “Just… take me off this case.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But we’ve been trying for so long,” Jen argued. “We’re almost there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not now, vegetable,” Agatha snapped, making Jen roll her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia opened her mouth to protest before stopping herself. “As you with, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She nodded. “Thank you.” She picked up her things and walked out the office, sighing as she made her way back to her car.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky sat alone on the grass field, waiting for his mom to pick him up. He drummed his fingers against his knees, a habit he picked up from her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pulled over to him and he happily stood up, waving goodbye to the coach and clambered into the passenger seat of the car.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry I’m late, Nicky,” she started as he buckled his seatbelt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She shook his head. “It’s fine. It was only like five minutes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hmm,” she acknowledged. “How was soccer?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He frowned. “It was good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She glanced at him, noticing the tone. “What? What’s wrong?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What is it, you don’t like soccer?” She asked. “There’s no problem with that. There’s other things to do. It’s not for everyone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He sighed. “No it’s just…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Come on,” she said as she stopped at a red light. “You can tell me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Some of the others aren’t very nice,” he murmured. “They always ignore me and never pass the ball to me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. “These older boys?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He nodded. She gritted her teeth. Nicky hadn’t always fitted in with the boys around him. He had a kind heart and was gentle and quiet compared to the other boys in his area around his age. They were loud and feisty. She’d tried almost everything to help him fit in but she was hardly the best example herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The only mom friend she had was Wanda, another omega, who she’d met before she even had Nicholas, and even still she got tired of her from time to time. Her son, Billy, worked at the police station as a trainee and he was a lot to deal with. There was a lot that Agatha found similar between the two. Maybe he could help Nicky fit in more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She glanced at her son again who was busy eating a chocolate bar she’d saved in the car for him. Looking at him now she couldn’t see anything other than Rio. Nicky had inherited Agatha’s blue eyes and brunette hair but everything else down to the facial structure, that was all Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked away. She knew she’d be seeing that woman again, one way or another.</span>

<span>“I remember you. Do you remember that night?” A crackled voice sounded from the meeting room where Jen sat looking completely invested in whatever she was watching on her laptop. “We met at the bar. I ordered a beer and you ordered some fruity cocktail. Do you remember what happened next?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “What’re you watching?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Porn.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, shuffling over to see the recording of her meeting with Rio from yesterday. The cameras weren’t the best quality, nor the audio but Agatha could tell exactly what was going on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why’re you watching this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen paused the footage. “Well, since you’ve dropped the case, Lilia’s made me in charge now.” If Agatha could get away with workplace violence she’d definitely use that right now to strangle Jen. “You’re on babysitting duty. With Billy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What? Why you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you mean, why me?” Jen scoffed. “I’m just as good a cop as you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “Please. Name one case you solved.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen went to open her mouth before Lilia and Alice walked in, followed by an eager looking Billy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You dropped out of the case, Agatha,” Lilia pointed out. “That was your choice. Now you’re with Billy. And no. You can’t get out of doing this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay. Fine. Let’s get to it then,” she said, picking up her coat, walking over to him. “Right, what we got?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uhh,” he looked through the file. “Break in at some place called ‘Hart Florists.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hold on,” Agatha spoke as they walked through the precinct. “Hart Florists. That’s only a few blocks away from me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It says the owner… Sharon Davis wasn’t harmed but the shop was completely ruined.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>That's </span>
</em>
<span>her name?” Agatha gaped. “Shit. I’ve been calling her Mrs Hart the whole time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean… it’s not that bad,” he reassured as they stepped into the vehicle. “I mean… It's literally called Hart Florists. And it’s not like you call her that to her face.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She started the car and drove down to the shop. They pushed past the police tape to find a scared looking Mrs Davis chattering to another police officer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Police,” Agatha said, holding up her badge for verification as Billy quickly copied, fumbling to find his badge. “Heard there was a break in?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you think?” Sharon whined. “They trashed all my flowers. Totally ruined my carpet. Not to mention the pollen on my lovely purse.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But you’re not harmed, are you ma’am?” Billy asked worriedly as the other cops made their way around the scene.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She shook her head before making eye contact with Agatha. “Oh. Agatha. I’m sorry but I don’t think I’ll be able to pick up Nicky from school after this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gritted her teeth. She often used Sharon’s free time to her advantage, having her pick up her son from school. She was more than willing, usually to be fair and it was a huge help.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not to worry, Mrs Hart,” Agatha responded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sharon,” Billy hissed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll just… have to book it back to the school after my shift,” she said, more to herself. She looked back at Billy. “You gonna ask her the questions or what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, right,” he stuttered, bringing his notebook out. “Did you get a look at the suspect.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sharon nodded. “Yes. They were wearing some rather inappropriately fitted black clothes with a hood.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And their dynamic?” Billy asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“An alpha for sure,” she said. “The whole place smells.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha froze. Tight fitted clothes and an alpha. “Did you get a look at their face?” She asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sharon tilted her head. “No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Really? No skull face paint? Did they carry a dagger?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’re you talking about?” Sharon choked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I… nothing,” she quickly said, noticing Billy’s concerned face, making her way out the shop and onto the sidewalk. She took a breath, steadying herself. “It’s fine. She’s in prison. You’re safe. Nicky’s safe. It wasn’t her.” She called her phone. “Lilia, hey, just uhh making sure… Rio’s still in custody right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’re you talking about, Agatha?” Lilia questioned from the other line. “You’re not on the case anymore. This doesn’t concern you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is she there or not?” Agatha snapped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course she is,” Lilia confirmed. “What kind of department would the prison be if she escaped on her second day.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha nodded. “I just. She said—.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s taunting you, Agatha,” Lilia responded. “Trying to get under your skin. And it seems to be working.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay. Thanks.” Agatha hung up and walked back in. “We all finished up here?” She asked Billy who nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’ve got all the samples,” he said. “Ready to go when you are.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, giving a once over around the shop before the two left, heading back in the car.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She chewed at her fingernail as they drove back to the station.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, can we stop off at this place on the way?” Billy asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She narrowed her eyes. “We’re on a shift. I’m not taking your to your comic store or whatever it is you like.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He frowned. “Look, I was trying to be discreet but your vibes are just… all over the place right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My vibes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your… pheromones,” he winced in embarrassment. “I didn’t wanna say in case you didn’t notice but you’ve been scenting all over the place. I don’t know a lot about omegas and…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was mortified. She usually made sure her natural scent was covered. Most of the time the betas didn’t notice her smell, being well… betas. She hadn’t realised her scent was coming stronger.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She narrowed her eyes. Rio. Seeing that stupid alpha had gotten her all hormonal and acting like a horny teenager. She gritted her teeth. That's fine. She’d just… find a way to deal with it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This conversation never happened,” she said, simply.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He nodded. “Okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They arrived back at the precinct and donated the samples to the lab. She took a seat and popped a few pills for the hormones, hoping to calm them down. She stayed like that for a few hours, typing away reports on the computer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh,” she grunted in discomfort as she felt her head dizzying.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Someone cleared their throat. She turned to see Billy again. He smiled weakly and handed her a few papers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s the lab test results,” he said. “Not who you think it is.” He said knowingly before correcting himself. </span>
<em>
<span>“If </span>
</em>
<span>that’s what you’re thinking.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She looked at the papers and let out a sigh of relief. The DNA showed no connection to her, instead tying to a repeat offender already in the system.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sighed in relief. </span>
<em>
<span>Thank God. </span>
</em>
<span>That’d be sure to calm herself down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay, good job, Teen,” Agatha spoke. “You’re excused.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My name is Billy—.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Off you go,” she said, making a waving gesture with her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She watched as he left, before turning her attention over to Jen and Alice, talking over her case. Her old case. She frowned. Should she have dropped it? It was the most fulfilling work she’d had in ages and she dropped it just like that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Now she was stuck babysitting some teenager she didn’t even like that much. She had no purpose. No excitement. Nothing to get her teeth into.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The glanced at the clock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Shit.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She’d completely forgotten Sharon wouldn’t be able to pick Nicky up from school. She gathered her coat and bag, rushing over to Lilia.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lilia, I need to pick Nicky up,” she said frantically. “I promise I’ll—.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just go,” Lilia dismissed. “Please. The place is beginning to smell like desperate omegas.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She blushed and threw herself out the door, launching into her car and sped to her son’s school.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pulled up to the building only to see him not at the gate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nicky?” She called. “Nicky?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She frowned and made her way to the front desk at the school.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey,” she introduced. “I’m so sorry I’m late. It’s Nicholas’s mom. Is he here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The receptionist frowned. “His sitter picked him up after school.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sitter? I didn’t call,” she frowned. Maybe Sharon </span>
<em>
<span>had </span>
</em>
<span>been able to pick him up. She turned away, heading out the school, back in the car, driving again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She fumbled with her keys, unlocked the door and entered her house. It was different. A familiar scent. There was an alpha with him. Not Sharon’s dynamic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nicky!” She called again, this time sounding more like a shout.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She could hear laughter from upstairs. Her son. And another person. She threw herself up the stairs, running into his room and tore the door open.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He sat there cross legged, around his Lego set he’d been in the middle of showing to someone. That someone being Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mommy, you’re here!” He smiled, his hands still on the Lego pieces.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah Mommy, we missed you,” Rio grinned in an almost mocking voice. “Nicky was just showing me his Lego set.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s throat bobbed. “Nicky. Get out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Nicky responded confusedly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I’ll go,” Rio responded, already standing up, following Agatha out the room. She closed the door behind her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How did you…” Agatha trailed off, still unsure what to say, feeling for her gun in her pocket.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Get out? Escape?” Rio asked, noticing Agatha’s fumbling. She walked around the woman before waving a hand dismissively. “It’s a long story.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you want,” Agatha asked quietly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re going to help me,” Rio responded from behind her in a soft whisper. Agatha flinched, holding her gun securely but Rio’s hand was already on top of hers, guiding it back in its pocket. “Shhhh…” she cooed. “There’s no need for that.” She inhaled at Agatha’s neck. “You’re nervous. Is it because of me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What. Do. You. Want?” Agatha repeated slowly, trying not to back down despite the circumstances not exactly being in her favour.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, pulling herself away from the older woman and leaned against the wall. “You know how long I’ve been working for the Salem Seven?” Agatha shook her head. “Too long. I need out. And you’re going to get me that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why would I help you?” Agatha scoffed as her anxiety cooled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re a detective, aren’t you?” Rio asked. “You let me stay here. Somewhere to… hide. At least until they’re taken care of. And I’ll help you solve your case.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s not my case anymore,” Agatha corrected her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But you still want it,” she said. “I mean… this is surely the most excitement you’ve had in… what… years. Won’t it feel good to finally take down the gang that's been haunting you all this time. Not to mention the promotion that’ll come with it. Nicer house. More time with Nicky.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How do I know you won’t turn against me?” Agatha questioned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio thought for a moment before shrugging. “You don’t. You’ll just have to trust me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky suddenly walked out the room, joining the two, not noticing the tension. “Rio brought me to McDonald’s and told me I could get whatever I liked. She’s way more fun than Mrs Davis. She only bakes casseroles.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled at that. “Don’t expect it all the time,” she said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky laughed and jumped down stairs. “Down down down the road…” he murmured as he made his way down to the living room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Whatever happens, Agatha,” Rio said, looking back at her. “You can trust me on one thing. I’m not letting any harm come to our son. All I want is to be free. I’ve been working for The Salem Seven for most of my life. I need to escape. I’m doing whatever it takes. But I won’t let them hurt you. Or our son.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>My </span>
</em>
<span>son,” Agatha corrected.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Whatever.” She paused again. “You might want to take a shower, by the way.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Excuse me?” Agatha spat with narrowed eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re going into an early heat,” Rio pointed out. “At least that was how I felt from the smell of you.” She brought a hand to Agatha’s hip. “But hey… if you want I can always help with that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She slapped her hand away. “No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha walked down stairs, leaving a slightly annoyed Rio to follow her. She saw Nicky on the couch, staring at the tv, watching his usual Harry Potter films and took a seat next to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she started. “We need to talk about something important. Can you pause the movie?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He did so, looking worriedly at her as Rio took a seat in the kitchen, examining her nails nonchalantly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she said. “Will be staying with us for a while.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His eyes widened in delight. “Really?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She nodded warily. “Yeah.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s awesome!” He grinned. Agatha just then noticed just how similar their smiles were. “I can show her all my Legos!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Maybe later, buddy,” Agatha said. “I still need to make dinner.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll do it,” Rio offered. “Consider it as a thank you for letting me stay here. I’ll be your little housewife.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned as Nicky spoke up. “Isn’t the omega the housewife?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s not the 50s,” Rio shrugged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’d rather I cook,” Agatha said, stepping into the kitchen. “I’d rather not end the day with food poisoning.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My cooking skills aren’t that bad,” Rio scoffed as she stood up, following Agatha around the kitchen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky turned and left, leaving the two alone again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re making me the villain, Agatha,” Rio pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re a serial killer,” Agatha noted. “So sorry I’m not giving the benefit of the doubt to you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fair enough,” Rio shrugged as she continued moving after her, making Agatha groan in annoyance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How exactly is this arrangement going to work hmm?” She asked. “You just live in my house and help me take down your old boss?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s it,” Rio said. “Unless you want me to stay after. I’m sure we could continue this after the Seven are taken care of.” Agatha rolled her eyes. Rio huffed. “God, you’re no fun! What happened to the woman I hooked up with those years ago!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She became a mother,” Agatha grunted. “And if you want to stay here, you’re going to as well.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Count me in, boss,” Rio grinned. “Does that mean I get access to the master bedroom?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha went to snark at her before pausing. She hadn’t actually thought of that. She didn’t have any other rooms. The house was relatively small. There was no way she’d be letting the alpha share with her. Even if they had shared before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The couch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’ll sleep on the couch,” she repeated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That ugly ass thing?” Rio whined, gesturing to the old sofa.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What, not living up to your high standards?” Agatha taunted, biting back a grin as she lit the stove. “Well, I’m sorry this isn’t the hotel from six years ago.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled. “So you </span>
<em>
<span>do </span>
</em>
<span>remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha continued her task. “You think far too highly of yourself,” she pointed her spoon at her with a smug look. “You act like some big strong alpha here to save me. But from what I remember, you’re nothing but a needy brat.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin turned into a glare. “I'm not. You’re just some boring omega.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, knowing she struck a nerve. “I’m sorry. Did I hurt your feelings?” She put a finger to her lip. “I’ll make sure to watch myself around such a sensitive baby.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio growled, swiftly grabbing Agatha by the wrists, pinning her against the kitchen unit, making her grunt from the sudden pressure. “Don’t talk to me like that. You don’t wanna know what I’ve done to the people who've upset me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mmm say it like you mean it though,” Agatha taunted, biting her lip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was beyond confused. This wasn’t what she was used to. She was the one in charge. Not some pathetic omega. Why was she blushing? She quickly pulled herself away from her, looking away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Whatever. Just…” </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck</span>
</em>
<span>. She didn’t know what to say now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Get some bowls from up there,” Agatha directed, motioning to the shelves. “Assuming you’re wanting to eat with us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio did so, grabbing the dishes, placing them on the table. This was going differently than expected. Agatha finished up cooking and called Nicky back downstairs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She dished up the pasta adding it to the plates and sat down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, how was school, Nicky?” She asked, looking at her son.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It was fine,” he shrugged. “Some boys pushed me into the mud and I had to change my clothes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha gasped worriedly as Rio twirled her pasta with her fork. “Did you tell the teacher?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He shook his head. “They said if I told them they'd kill me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shut her eyes. She knew the boys’ threats were empty promises but she couldn’t help but worry for her son’s safety.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Suddenly Rio spoke up. “Do you fight back?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky shook his head. “Our teacher says to use our words, not our hands.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed. “That’ll hardly work if they’re already hurting you.” She pushed her seat back, looking at him. “Here’s what you do next time. If they push you and you're on the ground. Grab them by the legs and wait until they fall.” He nodded eagerly. “If you’re still standing just lift your leg and hit your knee between their left.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Or stay away from them and tell a teacher they won’t leave you alone,” Agatha suggested, looking pointedly at Rio who gave an innocent shrug.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Whatever you want, kid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After dinner was finished, Nicky excused himself and went back upstairs to get into his pyjamas for bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stood by the sink, placing the bowls into the dishwasher. Rio watched her curiously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s not like I told him how to use a knife,” Rio defended, knowing Agatha was annoyed by her advice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No talking,” Agatha commanded. Rio went quiet. Agatha moved back to her. “There’s a spare blanket on the couch. Make yourself comfy. Don’t even think about coming upstairs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And with that she left.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha awoke quickly. After sleeping with one eye open the whole night, it doesn’t take much to get out of bed. Not to mention the soon to be arriving heat. Agatha groaned. The presence of an alpha in the house was definitely not helping with that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She slipped her dressing gown on and quickly peeked through the door to Nicky’s room. She sighed in relief upon seeing him still in his bed snoring softly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She made her way downstairs, cursing to herself at having to see Rio again. She assumed the alpha would also be asleep, only to see her on the kitchen table, tending to some old flowers Agatha had dying in a vase.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She smiled upon seeing her entering.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey,” she spoke. “I was just saving these flowers. Such a shame, the short life you give them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A little ironic, don’t you think,” Agatha snorted and she poured herself cereal. She sat down, watching Rio. “So, what? Is that your thing? You kill people but love gardening.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Death is a natural part of life, Agatha,” she responded. “The world would be far too overcrowded if we were to all live forever.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s not exactly a yes or no,” Agatha responded. She sighed and stopped herself from arguing, knowing there was no way she’d be able to with a psychopath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled at the display of flowers, placing them back up on the mantle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you sleep well?” She asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I slept fine,” Agatha responded un surely. “How was the sofa?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Could’ve slept better,” Rio admitted. “Honestly it was torturous. Especially knowing how close you were. Just a few rooms away.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha cleared her throat. “I’ve uh… called Mrs Hart to make sure someone will be here to watch Nicky.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Am I supposed to know who that is?” Rio asked before shaking her head. “And why do you even need someone looking after him? You have me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed. “Yeah, cause you’re </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> great with kids.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The alpha looked offended. “You don’t know me. I might be a mother of five.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And are you?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio admitted. “But I’m good with Nicky.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’ve known him for a day,” Agatha pointed out. “Whether you’re good or not. I’m not letting my son hang out with a murderer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why?” Rio questioned. “Scared the genes might rub off on him?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, picking up her bowl to clean it before Rio stopped her, standing up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Stop. Let me,” she offered, taking the bowl from the omega’s hands. She trailed her fingers over her hand before taking it to the sink. Agatha flushed from the touch before mentally telling herself to calm down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Stupid heat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The door rang and Agatha made her way to answer it before Rio came rushing forward, swinging the door open.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hi, you must be Mrs Hart,” she said with a smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sharon started at the suddenness of the woman before sending a sigh and small chuckle. “No dear. It’s Sharon. And who are you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m-.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s a guest. Staying here for a few nights,” Agatha said, stepping in, pushing Rio behind her. “She won’t bother you. Will you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio bit her lip before chuckling. “No. I’ll be good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled and walked back upstairs, got dressed and said goodbye to Nicky.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mrs Hart is here,” she said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What about Rio?” He asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. “Also here. But stay with Mrs Hart. Okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She walked down, holding her work bag and coat, before she was stopped once more, by Rio who was waiting at the door. Agatha glanced at the living room where Sharon was sitting, watching something on the tv.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re on your heat,” Rio observed, a hand on Agatha’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I still have time,” Agatha responded, knowing her scent was catching on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Salem, Massachusetts,” Rio spoke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The Seven’s base,” she said. “It should’ve been obvious considering their name is literally the </span>
<em>
<span>Salem </span>
</em>
<span>Seven but I wouldn’t believe in your cops too much.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “Great. Thanks.” She moved to leave before Rio reached out, grabbing her wrist with a strong grip. “What now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pulled a pen out, scribbling coordinates onto her wrist. “Their exact location. Don’t make it obvious to the cops you know too much. Give a broader guess. There’s security footage of them in this town.” She scribbled more words down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Agatha noted. “I’ll make sure to wash off the ink.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, walked back. “Te Veo.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha threw her coat on and drove to the station.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As expected the station was ablaze. Stressed out co-workers scattered around the building as Lilia tried calming everyone down. She took sight of Agatha, grabbing her and pulling her into the briefing room with Alice and Jen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jesus, what’s with people grabbing me today?” Agatha shrieked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” she said as the two walked in. Agatha took a seat, knowing what was coming. “There’s been a slight… issue.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio Vidal broke out of prison,” Jen finished.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jen!” Lilia hissed. “But yes. She broke out last evening.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Agatha played, hoping she wasn't too obviously lying. “Oh… oh no. How did this happen?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice frowned. “She hurt herself, making an officer come in her cell, before stabbing him with a pen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. She didn’t notice any wounds on her. She’d ask later. Agatha stopped herself, scoffing. No she wouldn’t. She didn’t care.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A pen?” Agatha asked. “Where’d she even get that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice moved her laptop over to Agatha to get a look. The same footage of her interview with Rio. Only she missed one detail. She dropped her pen at some point and Rio scooped it up with her foot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She then took the chance to use the guards' own weapons against him,” Lilia explained. “Knocking him unconscious. She stripped him and wore his clothes, fleeing the scene.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“God. That’s a lot of information,” Agatha said. “Look. I know what you’re saying and I know this is a very humbling moment for you but… I accept.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Accept what?” Lilia questioned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The lead of the case back,” Agatha clarified. “I mean… Jen’s been in charge for less than a day and shits already hit the fan. Trust me though. I’m happy to help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It wasn’t my fault she escaped,” Jen defended. “You’re the one who dropped the pen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, you should’ve seen that on the footage,” Agatha bit back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay, the footage is very blurry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not as blurry as your brain!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Enough!” Lilia commanded, silencing the two. “Jen. As bad as this sounds, we need Agatha. As much as I hate to say it… she is our best detective.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Agatha grinned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But Jen and Alice are still working on the case with you,” Lilia added.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh!” Agatha groaned. “Fine! I could use some coffee holders anyway. Let’s get to work, team!”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s nose scrunched angrily as she fixed the drooping flowers in the vase. Sharon watched her with a bitten lip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No dear,” she said. “What you’ve gotta do is-.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio nodded, not bothering to hear what the woman had to say. “I’ll try that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She placed the vase down, admiring her work before Sharon motioned to the stairs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Umm… I’ll just go make sure Nicholas is awake,” she said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her. “No. Let me.” She took off upstairs before Sharon could say no.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She walked to his room, stopping to inhale the scent of Agatha’s bedroom which still smelled of her. She felt the doorknob, wanting to see inside, but resisted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>The time will come.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And from the smell of heat, Rio guessed the time would probably be very soon.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She knocked on Nicky’s door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nicky?” She called. “It’s Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Come in.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pushed the door open. He was sat hunched over a game console Rio didn’t recognise. Being raised by a ruthless criminal gang, she didn’t exactly have the time to experience such things like games.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Watcha playin?” She asked, taking a seat next to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Minecraft,” he responded. “I’m building a theatre.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Cool, can you show me?” She asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He nodded excitedly, giving the alpha a tour around not just the theatre, but his whole city he’d built.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, this is cool,” she observed. “You did this all on your own?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He nodded. “Yeah. You can play the game with friends but…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes softened, recognising the tone. “That’s fine. Sometimes it’s better to do things alone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t like it,” he admitted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She twiddled with the button on her shirt. </span>
<em>
<span>Shit. She was bad at this. </span>
</em>
<span>She took her hand away from her shirt, realising it was putting pressure on the wound she’d inflicted upon herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you want for lunch?” Rio asked, changing the subject.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can we have McDonald’s again?” He asked hopefully.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She chuckled, shaking her head. “No. You had that yesterday. Anything else?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He frowned. “Just not casserole.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She nodded, standing up to leave.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio,” he called one last time. She stopped, awaiting his question. “Can you play Minecraft with me?”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So, Salem Massachusetts,” Agatha noted, pinning together her clue board. “That’s their base. They have multiple locations around America but this is their beehive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen narrowed her eyes suspiciously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And this has only just come to you?” She questioned. “They’re literally called the </span>
<em>
<span>Salem</span>
</em>
<span> Seven.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha cleared her throat. “A few of them have been found on CCTV footage around this small town.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice sat more upright, intrigued in the footage. “This is great. I’ve spent ages looking through CCTV but I’d never… How’d you find it, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I guess…” Agatha spoke, trying to think up something on the spot. “There are some more suited to this job than others.” She looked directly at Jen. “Anyway! We still have-.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What about Lady Death?” Jen spoke up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What now?” Agatha asked through gritted teeth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio Vidal,” Jen said. “The serial killer who escaped last night. Your ex lover—.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah I know,” Agatha snapped. “Look. The station made a mistake. She escaped. But that shouldn’t be stopping us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“For someone with such a personal link, you seem pretty chill,” Alice pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Personal?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Baby daddy,” Jen clarified. “Are we forgetting this whole thing? Agatha. A murderer knocked you up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Like six years ago.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And is now on the run.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Has technically been ‘on the run’ for her whole life.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you’re not even a little bit concerned?” Jen finished.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Maybe I just like the bad boys,” Agatha shrugged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not a fucking serial killer,” Jen scoffed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There’s a bad boy and then there’s a criminal,” Alice added.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay. Thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What if she comes for Nicholas?” Jen added. “She knows you’re a detective and knows of your connection. What if she goes after him?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I won’t let that happen,” Agatha responded simply. “You worry too much Jenny. When was the last time you got laid?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When was the last time </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> did?” Jen snorted. “Because you’re practically drowning us in your pheromones right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jen!” Alice hissed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This is why we mainly work with betas,” Jen added, gesturing between the two.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And this is why I don’t work with bitches!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re the bitch!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re the—!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Enough!” Lilia said, barging into the room. “Will you two stop it? You're both grown women. Not young children. And you’re both working on this case whether you like it or not. You were recruited because of your skills. Not for your personality or dynamics. And you’re solving this case.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you not even slightly worried?” Jen asked as Agatha fiddled with her hair. “She might be hunting us down as we speak.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia shrugged with a long sigh. “This job comes with risks. It’s what you signed up for. In the end. Death comes for us all.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Agatha had arrived home, she knew her heat had started. She calmed herself down before entering. She’d made a plan in her head. She’d usher Sharon out the house and lock herself up in her room until she was feeling better, leaving Nicky and Rio in the living room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She frowned. She still wasn’t fully sure about leaving her alone with him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She opened the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m home!” Agatha called. “Nicky?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She heard the faint humming of the tv and found him in the living room with a controller in his hand next to Rio, also playing with him. They both stared intensely at the screen, locked in their virtual world.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky whined as Rio cackled gleefully, probably ruining his world on the game. But he looked happy. Happier than he had for a long time. She smiled and felt something stirring within her. A foreign feeling. She watched as Rio’s eyes narrowed and tongue flicked, concentrating on the game.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nicky,” Agatha said again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They both turned to her and smiled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mom!” He smiled, picking himself up to hug her. She embraced him before he pulled away and looked at her with a scrunched nose. “You smell funny.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, knowing the scent was getting obvious. She looked over to Rio, who from the looks of her blushing face, could also sense the smell.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sharon and Nicky made pizza if you want some,” Rio said. “It’s still in the oven but it’ll be ready soon.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded surprised. “Oh. Uh. Sure. Where is she?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She had to head home,” Rio supplied. “Something to do with a back massager finally arriving from Amazon?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her face lift in disgust. “That’s… uh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mommy, look!” Nicky said, pulling his mom to the tv screen. “Me and Rio played Minecraft. We made a garden and a maze. Also, she tamed a skeleton horse so I had to build a shed for it.” He lifted the controls and showed Agatha the sights.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s nice, honey,” she smiled. “What did you have for lunch?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, I wanted McDonald’s but Rio said I’d get fat if I ate too much so we had pasta.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio cooked?” Agatha asked, still worried about the alpha feeding her son.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, I helped,” he added. The oven pinged. He looked at Rio. “Is the pizza ready?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sure it is,” she said, giving his hair a quick ruffle, heading to the kitchen. She pulled on some oven gloves and took the pizza out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha and Nicky followed after her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It looks good!” He said before looking at Agatha. “Do you want a slice, mommy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure, go ahead,” she said after a long hesitation. She didn’t want her son to see her nervous.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio cut them each a few slices, dishing it out before they started eating. Nicky finished up quickly, looking at Rio expectantly. “Can we get back to the game?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She shook her head. “Sorry. I have to talk to your mom. Tomorrow though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He nodded in defeat, bringing the console back upstairs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How’s the case going?” Rio asked after a long pause.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s going,” Agatha responded, taking a beer out the fridge, walking over to the living room, Rio close behind. She sat down on the couch. “They believe me. I think. Although they’re probably too preoccupied by my smell right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, sitting down next to her. “It is pretty distracting. Just be glad you’re not alone. If I was some creepy alpha I’d try to have you all for myself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Aren’t you already a creepy alpha?” Agatha snorted, taking a sip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If I was creepy,” Rio stated. “I’d have had my way with you already.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stilled, clutching her beer and crossing her legs. Rio edged closer to her, far too close. They were touching now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, inhaling softly. “You’re driving me crazy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow, despite the feeling of the younger woman being so close.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, </span>
<em>
<span>I’m </span>
</em>
<span>driving </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>crazy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled softly, biting her lip before glancing down at Agatha’s own lips. She moved closer, before closing the gap.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped slightly at the sudden movement before meeting her lips in the kiss. Their lips meshed together like two pieces of a whole as Rio pushed her back slightly, moving her hands to Agatha’s hair, curling her fingers around.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her tongue pushed past Agatha lips, seeking entry, Agatha allowing her so, moaning softly from the sensations she’d been seeking for so long.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pushed her down on the couch, taking the beer Agatha had been holding, placing it on the floor. She stared down at Agatha’s dazed eyes and crawled on top of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She moved a hand under the omega's shirt trailing up to her breast where her fingers worked softly around her nipple, under her bra.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed in pleasure, reaching up to Rio’s own shirt, unbuttoning it slowly. Rio watched her with hooded eyes as she took sight of the wound on her stomach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>So that’s how she escaped.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She moved past it, to the younger woman’s chest, squeezing slightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pulled away, gasping for air. “Fuck. You’re so hot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No talking,” Agatha commanded, slightly breathless. “Take off your pants.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, moving her hand out Agatha’s bra, already hooking her fingers around her belt, pulling her pants down. Agatha's own hand pulled out from Rio’s shirt. She moaned as Agatha’s hand then grabbed at her crotch, feeling her hardness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Already?” Agatha taunted. “So desperate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio went to speak before Agatha kissed her again. “I said no talking. Just hurry up and fuck me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio felt for Agatha’s zip of her jeans, quickly tugging it down excitedly, reaching a hand in, searching for her wetness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, arching her back as Rio’s long fingers found it, slowly, teasingly circling around the entrance softly. Her digits slipped in easily from how aroused the omega already was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha moaned again, trying to move to the feeling. Rio grinned, curling her fingers inside her as the older woman panted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” she murmured softly. “More.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio increased her pace, adding more pressure deeper in. All too soon Agatha’s hips bucked and she found her release, clenching around the alpha’s fingers before slumping down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The nothingness didn’t last long as Rio tugged for Agatha’s pants to come off, feeling herself get harder at the sight of the woman come undone. She needed to be inside her. And Agatha needed it too from the feeling of her grinding their centers together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Suddenly there was a loud knock on the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit!” Agatha cursed, quickly pushing Rio off her, spilling her beer on the carpet. “Shit!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio scrambled to find her pants before diving into the bathroom as Agatha pulled her pants on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smoothed herself down and opened the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her eyes widened upon seeing Jen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jen! What’s you..?” She started.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m…” she started, before giving Agatha a once over at her state and smell. “Going to do this quickly. How I acted was unprofessional and cruel. We’re coworkers and should be behaving better. I’m going to help more with this case from now on.” She handed Agatha a box of chocolates.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, Jen,” Agatha spoke. “That was very mature of you and I accept your apology.” Jen waited, as if wanting Agatha’s apology. “Is that all?” She asked innocently.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen out on a fake smile. “No. That’s it. I’ll see you at work tomorrow.” Agatha smiled, going to close the door. “Oh, and Agatha.” Agatha held the door still.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hmm?” Agatha cooed politely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your fly’s undone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The door closed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck.</span>

<p>
<span>The next few days went by quickly. Agatha had stayed the rest of the evening up til night alone in her bed. She couldn’t bear to look at Rio after what they just did. Not to mention Jen interrupting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had simply gritted her teeth and rode out her heat until she blacked out on her pillow and slept through the whole night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She’d continued on with her case as Rio guided her through the information while spending time with Nicky on the side.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had been dreading her day off. Stuck with just Rio. She had no idea how she’d handle it. She could barely put up with the younger woman from what little time she saw her already.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After getting Nicky ready for school she made her way downstairs, past Rio who was still sleeping and got in the car. They drove off to his school before she took him to the gates.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Now remember,” Agatha directed. “If the mean boys say </span>
<em>
<span>anything, </span>
</em>
<span>tell your teacher. Mommy loves you so much. Okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He nodded, turning to go. “Bye!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She watched as he left. She sighed sadly, driving back home.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She swung the door open, dropping her keys down before a smell came into her senses. She paused, noticing it. The smell of an alpha’s pheromones. Specifically their arousal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That was when she heard it. The faintest sound of moaning coming from the living room and the occasional wet sound.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha paused. Unsure of what to do. She stopped at the living room door, her hand ghosting the handle before swinging it open.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio jumped in fright, practically falling over herself while under her blanket. She shrieked, removing her hand from under. Agatha took sight of her appearance. Blushed face and ruffled hair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’s going on?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’re you doing here?” Rio asked at the same time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s my day off,” Agatha said after a pause. She glared. “This is my house.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah I umm,” Rio spoke, coughing slightly, running a hand through her hair. “I think I’ve got a fever or something. That’s… why i'm like this—.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh calm down,” Agatha snorted, sitting on the opposite couch. “This isn’t my exactly the first time I’ve caught an alpha having some ‘me time.’”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio blushed, sitting up before rushing to make her bed. Agatha tried not to notice the obvious bulge in her pyjama trousers as she tidied the couch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, I can say goodbye to ever using that couch again,” Agatha snorted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uhh,” Rio murmured. “I’ll wash it.” She paused. “If it’s any consolation you interrupted me before I could’ve gotten the sheets… y’know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s for the details,” Agatha responded. “Do you do this everyday?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio snorted. “While there’s a kid in the house? My kid at that. Fuck no.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was at least somewhat relieved at that. She went to stand up before seeing Rio’s disappointment on her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re leaving?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why? Want me to watch?” Agatha scoffed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes. “I’m hardly in the mood anymore.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That tells me otherwise,” Agatha said, gesturing to her crotch which Rio quickly hid away, crossing her legs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha made her way out the room, soon followed by Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, partner,” she called, making Agatha roll her eyes. “What’re we doing today?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>We </span>
</em>
<span>aren’t doing anything,” Agatha said. “I’m going to mind my own business and you’re going to stay out of my way.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh, you’re such a pain,” Rio groaned. “I’ve had no fun the past weeks. I’ve been stuck here waiting for your slow ass to finish the case.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You got yourself in this situation when you started working for The Salem Seven,” Agatha pointed out. “So sorry I haven’t been entertaining enough.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey! I haven’t killed anyone for a few weeks now,” Rio pointed out. “You should be congratulating me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, well done, Rio,” Agatha spoke sarcastically. “You’ve managed to spend a few days not taking innocent people’s lives.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not all innocent!” Rio defended.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My mistake. Well done for not… murdering,” Agatha corrected herself with a huff. “Good job. Want me to call you a good girl?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio paused before grinning, snaking her arm around Agatha’s waist. “I wouldn’t be opposed to it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh!” Agatha groaned, detaching herself from her. “You're unbelievable!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you’re no fun!” Rio bit back. “You’re like Sharon!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The woman you have who looks after your son.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, flower lady,” Agatha laughed. “Wait. You’re comparing me to her? I’m not that bad.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio giggled, knowing that comment annoyed her. “You </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> are.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I may be a lot of things,” Agatha said. “But I’m </span>
<em>
<span>not </span>
</em>
<span>like that boring old tart.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then why don’t you tell me about yourself,” Rio offered with a smirk. “Over… a drink?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. Did this freak really think she was smooth?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine,” Agatha said. “You know what. It’s my day off. I have nothing better to do. I’ll get us some beers and we can… talk.” Rio grinned. “But </span>
<em>
<span>please </span>
</em>
<span>get changed into proper clothes. You smell like a horny teenager.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, already lifting her pyjama shirt up, giving Agatha a view of her toned muscles and healing scar.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not here!” Agatha shrieked, looking away. “Go to the bathroom.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right,” Rio nodded, walking past her. “Can I use your shower?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Go ahead,” Agatha nodded. Rio walked off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She grabbed two beers out the fridge and sat on the couch, switching the tv on while Rio busied herself in the shower. Eventually Agatha heard it turn off and Rio walked in the living room wearing Agatha’s clothes with still soaking hair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re not even gonna dry it?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her hair, taking a handful of it, pulling the water out like a wet cloth, letting it fall to the floor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay, thank you,” Agatha snorted. Rio took a seat next to her, taking the beer from her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’re you watching?” Rio asked, taking sight of the tv.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s attention turned back to it. “I don’t know. Some marvel show about witches. Nicky’s really into his superheros right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Cool,” Rio said, taking a sip of the beer. “I never really watched that kind of thing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha scoffed. “Too busy killing people?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio frowned, looking down at her lap. Agatha looked away, feeling slightly awkward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uhh… the case is going well,” she said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, yeah?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “Yeah, we’re getting closer. At least from the looks of it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can I ask you a question?” Rio asked suddenly, surprising Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why didn’t you just call the cops on me?” She asked. “I mean… you could’ve easily done so… multiple times. Yet you haven’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha froze. Why didn’t she? A part of her felt like she had to. She didn’t know why. There was some weird loyalty to the woman. Despite the fact she’d barely known her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You would’ve escaped anyway,” Agatha said, deciding on her reason. “Might as well have got a use out of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh yeah?” Rio smirked. “I’m useful?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re a fucking tool, is what you are,” Agatha snapped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, then taking notice of the many pictures on the mantle of Agatha and Nicky together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wish I got to be there to raise him,” she said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, he’s only six,” Agatha pointed out. “There’s still raising to be done.” She took another sip. “Plus, having a cop Mom and a serial killer Mom don’t exactly look good on paper.” She chuckled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wanted to find you, you know,” Rio said with a still serious face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You did?” Agatha asked confusedly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “I don’t exactly have a habit of sleeping with random women while on missions.” She paused. “There was something about you. After we hooked up I watched you. From afar. But I was there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand. “Watching me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “I’d follow you… around coffee shops and bookstores. From PTA meetings to yoga classes. Never close enough for you to catch. Just enough to watch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha slowly inched away from her. “Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze softened. “Because you’re mine.” She moved closer. “And I am yours.” Her gaze then hardened. “Say it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not saying anything to you,” Agatha spat, before attempting to change the subject. “How did… How did you even know Nicky’s yours? For all you know it might be some random alpha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You didn’t,” Rio said. Almost a command.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What if I did?” Agatha taunted. “They might have been better than you. Had their way with me. My body. Had me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Stop it!” Rio growled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You think you’re special,” Agatha continued. “You were just a good fuck. That’s all. I could’ve just moved onto the next person I saw.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio snarled, grabbing Agatha by her neck, tightening her grip, pushing her down on the couch slightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She then tilted her head. “According to Wanda, I’m the only person you’d been with for a long time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widened. “You… spoke to Wanda?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips curled in a cruel smile. “She loves a good yap after a few drinks.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What is wrong with you?” Agatha croaked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What was it she said about you?” Rio questioned, ignoring her, taunting the omega. “Yeah. Loud. Nosy. Kinda flirty. Too casual with your boundaries.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t believe it. This whole time. Rio had been there. Watching her. Following her. Stalking her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck you!” She spat, making Rio grin wider.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Baby, you should know I don’t like being teased,” she cooed, slowly bringing her dagger, which Agatha hadn’t even realised she had, up to the woman’s neck, trailing it softly down to the collar of her shirt. “You’re beautiful, you know that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was slightly taken aback by the comment, especially with the dagger on her throat. She hissed through the pain, not wanting to show her weakness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you’re a bitch,” Agatha spat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze hardened, letting her dagger drift further down to the valley between Agatha’s breasts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re so vulnerable,” Rio smirked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Suddenly Agatha grabbed at the dagger, pushing Rio down, making her grunt, as the two both held onto the sharp object.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Only physically,” Agatha said through gritted teeth. She glanced down at the dagger, mentally cursing for the fact she’d gripped the sharper edge of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned like a maniac watching the woman on top of her with a soft blush. “If you wanted to have me pinned down, you could’ve just asked.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha glared before feeling the dagger being drawn away, swiping angrily against her skin. She groaned in pain as Rio pulled it away, watching her expression with intense eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The dagger was ripped away, tossed to the floor before Agatha grabbed Rio by the neck, pushing her further down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Suddenly they were interrupted by a ringing. Agatha froze, before climbing off the younger woman, to pick up the phone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hello?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Miss Harkness,” the voice said. “It’s Nicholas’s principle. He’s gotten in a fight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her eyes widened in shock. “I’ll be there in ten.” She hung up, gathering her coat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’s going on?” Rio asked, still lying on the couch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nicky got in a fight,” she explained, before pointing an accusing finger at her. “This is your fault. You got it in his head he needed to fight the bullies.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And I stand by that,” Rio said, picking up her dagger, discarded on the floor. She gave Agatha a small grin before licking up the dagger, getting the salty taste of Agatha’s fresh blood.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha grimaced. “You’re so weird.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “Can I come?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“To the elementary school?” Agatha scoffed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Either that or I’ll go back to what I was doing earlier,” Rio pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned. “Fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned happily, grabbed a black hoodie, tying her hair in a ponytail, and slipped on some shoes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They clambered into the car and drove.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha tapped her fingers nervously against the steering wheel as Rio flicked the window open and closed. Agatha hit her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Stop that,” she commanded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio groaned. She switched on the radio, searching through the stations. She smacked the machine.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There’s nothing good here,” she grumbled. “Gimme your phone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The car doesn’t connect,” Agatha explained. “It uses a cd player.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jesus, how old is this car?” Rio snorted, picking up a cd booklet in the side, flicking through the options before sliding a cd into the slot. The music started playing. She hummed along peacefully.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lorna Wu, hmm?” Agatha questioned. “Good taste.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled before they pulled up to the school. Before they entered the building, Agatha gave her one last look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No funny business,” she said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head playfully. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She opened the door. The two were met by the receptionist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ahh, Miss Harkness,” she said. “Thank you for coming.” She took sight of Rio. “You must be Nicholas’s father.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No she’s—,” Agatha started as Rio spoke smugly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, that’s me,” she said, shaking her hand. “Rio Harkness. Nice to meet you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I believe I mistook for for his babysitter a few weeks ago,” she said. “But now I totally see the resemblance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio put a hand to her heart. “Oh. Thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shall we get going?” Agatha said loudly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The receptionist nodded, leading them to the meeting room where their son sat sheepishly, twiddling his thumbs. His anxiety only heightened as he watched his mom walk in, taking a seat next to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nicky, are you okay?” She asked him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m fine, Mom,” he murmured.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ma’am, your son got in a fight with another student,” the teacher said, opposite them, glancing at Rio who sat down with the two, glaring at him. “There was some name calling and slapping.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please,” Agatha scoffed. “They’re kids. Like you haven’t been called a butt face before. It’s not like him. Nicky’s well behaved.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nicky bit him,” the teacher said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio snorted in amusement as Agatha turned to look at Nicky in shock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” She questioned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I just did what you told me,” he defended.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I said no such thing,” Agatha quickly said, turning to the teacher. “I believe-.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, Rio,” he clarified, looking at the alpha who’d been filing her nails. “They stole my book and tore its pages open so I defended myself. Like you told me to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. Rio nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Listen,” Rio said, finally speaking up, looking at the teacher. “Why don’t we just… forget this whole thing ever happened.” Then Agatha could smell it. The commanding pheromones. She looked to the alpha who’s glare had hardened as she quietened the beta teacher.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I… umm…” he spoke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We're going to leave,” she said, already standing up. “And you’re going to forget this happened. And while you’re at it make sure those boys leave my kid alone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky watched her curiously as did Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course,” the teacher said. “Sorry for the inconvenience.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good,” Rio said, turning to the two. “Let’s go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha and Nicky both stood up, following her out the school.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why would you do that?” Agatha hissed as soon as they shut Nicky in the car.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do what?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Get all ‘ohh I’m a big scary alpha, you do as I say,’” she mocked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Look, I wasn’t exactly raised normally. I release pheromones when I need to,” Rio defended. “And they’re fixing the issue now. You should be thanking me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “Just get in the car.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, getting in the passenger seat. Agatha drove them back home.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thanks for defending him,” Agatha said meekly after a minute.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her in surprise. “Uhh…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed. “What? Don’t know what to say now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio blushed, looking away. “Whatever.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled. Maybe staying with her wasn’t so bad.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha awoke to the sound of a loud vibrating. She frowned, throwing on her dressing gown and walked downstairs to the sight of a messed up kitchen, a gleeful Nicky and Rio holding together a smoking blender.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha gasped, rushing over to the socket, unplugging the blender. “Chuck it out!” She said, opening the door to the back yard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, rushing to the back yard, dropping the blender on the ground before Agatha grabbed a hose, spraying it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They sighed, walking back in the house. Agatha calmed herself. “Now. Can someone tell me what just happened?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky stayed quiet, as did Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Am I speaking Chinese or something?” Agatha asked. “What happened?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We were trying to make a smoothie for you,” Nicky said quietly. “I know you weren’t feeling the best so I thought I’d surprise you. I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha watched him with sad eyes. “No. I’m sorry. Thank you for trying. I mean it.” She kissed him on the head. “Now, go get dressed and we can go out for the day.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He nodded, rushing back upstairs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’d better pay for that—,” Agatha started, turning to Rio before stopping herself upon seeing the younger woman’s face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” she spoke, through tears welling up. “I thought I could help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re… what?” Agatha hadn’t been expecting that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” Rio hissed through tears. “I can’t do anything! I can’t even make a fucking smoothie with my son.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s fine…” Agatha trailed off. “We can buy another smoothie. It was like $20 anyway.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I came here thinking I’d be able to have a fresh start, y’know,” she spoke. “What’s the point? I’d only ever been taught how to kill. I don’t know anything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated before wrapping an arm around the alpha, holding her tightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry,” she said. “I’ll… I’ll teach you. I’ll teach you to cook, clean, uhh how to drive a car, uhh… math… wait I’m bad at that…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a sad smile. “Thank you.” She paused. “How’s the case?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. “Going smoothly. Still much to be done.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded with a frown. “Oh. Okay. Sure.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha said firmly. “I’m going to get you out of this. You won’t be under their control anymore.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stared softly at her before her lip curled into a sneer. “You can’t. You can’t get away from them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped back. “But… the case.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s hopeless,” Rio cackled hysterically. “I'm going to be stuck with them til I’m dead! Either that or they just kill me! Some ragtag small town omega can’t help me. Nothing will help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stared worriedly. “No… I promise…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know how many people have tried taking them down?” Rio continued. “They’ve been from New York to Las Vegas. No one will ever stop them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So what?” Agatha scoffed. “You’re just giving up? Over a smoothie?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s not just a smoothie!” Rio snarled, pointing her dagger at her, which Agatha hadn’t even realised she was holding.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh!” Agatha groaned. “I don’t know what to do. What do you want?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pulled the dagger away, taking a breath as she closed her eyes. She exhaled, opening the front door. “Right. Okay,” she said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where are you going?” Agatha called.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s not safe,” Agatha said. “Just… stay…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio paused, looking back at her. “I can’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She left.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha fell to her knees. Fuck. Why did she care? Why was she upset? Why was Rio even upset in the first place?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mom?” Nicky called. “Where’s Rio?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned back around. “She’s gone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Will she come back?” She asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I… don’t know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I hope she does,” he said. “She could be my other mom.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, all my other classmates have a mom and a dad. I just… I wanted…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, Nicky,” Agatha sighed. “I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat on a bench by the swing set as Nicky pushed himself back and forth on the swings, exclaiming loudly whenever he’d get high.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She tapped her fingers against her knee.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Was the case really worthless? Was it all just a waste of time?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She huffed. This wasn’t exactly the best way to spend her day off work. She grumbled, running her fingers through her hair. Someone cleared their throat, standing in front of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio?” Agatha called.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who?” The voice responded. Agatha looked up to see someone much worse than Rio. Her mother. Evanora Harkness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mom? What’re you doing here?” Agatha sneered. “Here to ruin yet another happy moment?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Evanora scoffed, taking a seat next to her daughter. “I came to check on you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How’d you know I was here?” Agatha questioned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Evanora sighed. “Okay. I was going for a jog and I saw Nicholas on the swing set.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She nodded. “Didn’t know you still ran. How are you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Evanora scoffed. “Please. We both know you don’t care.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, it’s not like I can’t say the same for you,” Agatha pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So what’ve you been up to?” Evanora trailed off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I haven’t seen you in six years,” Agatha said, standing up abruptly. “Why do you suddenly care what I do with my life now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Evanora rolled her eyes and the two stayed quiet for a while.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You smell like an alpha,” she stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted. “What is this? Congratulations for getting laid?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Evanora narrowed her eyes in disgust, trying to start the conversation again. “What’s his name?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned. “There it is. How many times have I told you I’m a lesbian. I don’t like men.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I just thought maybe—.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Maybe nothing,” Agatha loudly. “I don’t like men. No thank you. How many ways do I need to say it. I’m a lady lover. Lesbo. Dyke. An evil lady kissing witch!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Keep your voice down!” Evanora hissed. “People might hear!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What? That your daughter’s a raging lesbo?” Agatha laughed. “Not to mention an omega. Oof. That’s two swords. And a single mother. Three.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Stop it.” She glanced at Nicky who was still swinging. “Nicholas might hear you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please,” Agatha scoffed. “He already knows.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You let your child be aware of your sin?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was the sound of crunching leaves and she looked over to see… Rio?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was running over to her. She stopped abruptly huffing for air loudly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, we need to—.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who’s this?” Evanora bit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My girlfriend,” Agatha spat, hooking an arm around a confused Rio. “My mate. And the father of Nicky.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You lay with this woman?” Evanora gasped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yup,” Agatha responded. She was done with her mom. If she wanted drama. She was going to get drama. “All day. All night. Every room. Even outside. Isn’t that right, baby?” She gave Rio a quick smack on the ass for the added effect, making Rio blush and splutter in confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This is the alpha?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s me,” Rio said, meekly turning to Agatha. “We need to leave. Right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What? Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t ignore me, girl,” Evanora demanded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can it hag!” Rio snarked, making Agatha snort with laughter and Evanora gasp in shock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you going to let her talk to me like that?” Evanora demanded. “Another one of your evil sins.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Aw, did that hurt your feelings, Mom?” Agatha sneered as mothers ushered their children away from the sight of the argument. “Did I hurt your feelings? Oh my God! Why do you still hate me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You were born evil,” Evanora responded, making Agatha halt in her movements.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I… what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha! We need to leave!” Rio shouted this time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I ought to have killed you the moment you left my body,” she stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Suddenly a fist was thrown in the air and Rio punched Evanora square across the face. The old woman fell to the floor, clutching her face in pain as Agatha gasped in a mix of shock and delight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at Rio with excitement. “I’m suddenly really turned on by you,” she whispered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The Salem Seven are here!” Rio finally said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha roared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They’ve found me,” she said. “We have to go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why didn’t you fucking say that,” Agatha hissed. “Nicky!” She yelled. “Let’s go!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He jumped off the swings and she grabbed his hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hi, Rio,” he smiled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He looked down at Evanora who was still groaning in pain. “Hi Grandma.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She gave him a small wave, still clutching herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The three clambered back into the car, quickly buckling up. Agatha drove fast through the woods, picking a more secluded route, making Nicky giggle excitedly in the back seat, unaware of the situation ahead of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked back, seeing people behind them. There were two. They both wore hoods and masks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s two of them,” Rio stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit.” She fumbled the compartment at the front of the car. “Nicky. Duck down, okay honey. Rio!” She handed the alpha the gun. She took it with a determined look, before turning behind angling the gun towards the car behind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha heard gunshots. She looked back at Nicky. “Cover your ears,” she said. He obeyed, quickly doing so as he hunched over, making sure he wasn’t seen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The sound of bullets clinked against the car.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck!” Rio hissed. She turned back to Agatha, checking the roads. “Make a sharp turn here. I think I can hit one there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. She waited before tearing at the wheel, making the turn quickly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio fired the gun, reaching out to angle the shot. It hit one of them square in the head, knocking them dead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes!” Rio cheered with a manic look in her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sent her a quick side eye before looking back at the road.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mommy, I’m scared,” Nicky cried.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just uhh sing our song, okay?” She suggested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He nodded. “Down. Down. Down the road…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha joined in, hoping to calm him slightly. Another sharp turn, another bullet. Rio moved swiftly avoiding a hit, almost catching her arm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You good?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m fine.” She took sight of the road ahead. “This isn’t the way to your house.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re right,” Agatha noted. “If they know where I live, I’m not taking any chances.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky screamed as a bullet narrowly missed him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>One last bullet. Rio angled it and hit. It fired, hitting the target in the head. She slumped down, dead. The car lost control and crashed into a thick tree.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s them,” Rio announced.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah but there’s five more of them,” Agatha pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can I uncover my ears?” Nicky asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes,” she quickly said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where are we going?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A friend's place.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen sighed contently as she laid down on her couch, reading her contemporary literacy book with her biodegradable face mask and her feet soaking in bubbly water. Soft lofi music played as she flicked the pages, humming along to the beat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was a loud banging at the door. She sighed, placing her bookmark in, opening the door. Her eyes widened to see a rather messed up looking Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, Jenny,” she smiled wildly. “Room for three more?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t wait for an answer, barging in, followed by Nicky then Rio. She set to work quickly, locking up the doors and windows, adding barricades.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry, what the hell is going on?” Jen questioned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your case,” Rio supplied, sitting on the couch, dipping her feet in the bubbly water. “God, I could get used to this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who is this?” Jen asked as Nicky twiddled his thumbs nervously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jen. Meet Rio. Rio. Meet Jen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Jen spoke. “Rio Vidal. Lady Death.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No one really says that now,” Rio asked. “Do they?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, what is going on?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Long story short,” Agatha said. “The Salem Seven are no longer seven. That’s two down. Five to go. How long do you think it’ll be until they find us?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio giggled. “It’s never usually a long wait with them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Agatha said, after making sure the house was fully secure. She looked at Jen. “Not exactly the best host, are ya Jen? Not even a charcuterie board?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen angrily tore at her skincare mask. “This is why I don’t have work friends.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you have any lunchables?” Nicky asked, sitting next to Rio. “I’m hungry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen took notice of Rio. “Hey, get your feet out there! That’s mine!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled. “Trust me. I’ve been to places you wouldn’t even imagine. You don’t wanna know where these have been. Don’t bother using it again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t tell how much of that was true.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are they after you?” Jen asked. “Don’t you work for them?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sighed nonchalantly. “I’ve retired.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can you retire from the assassin business?” Agatha questioned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean, I just did,” Rio pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She is fucking crazy,” Jen said. “She can’t be in my house.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Welcome to my world,” said Agatha. “I’ve been with her for only a few days and look what’s happened!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that how you knew so much information about the case?” Jen questioned. “Cause your baby daddy had all the intel.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat upright with a silencing motion. “Jen. Stop.” She glanced at Nicky who wasn’t paying any attention.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh my God!” Jen gasped. “I’m connecting the dots.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re not connecting shit,” Agatha said with a roll of her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m at least calling for backup,” Jen stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No!” Rio said, suddenly standing. “They’re not taking me. They can’t. I can’t go back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t give a shit what you want you creepy alpha,” Jen said, already dialling the number. “You’re going to jail after this whether you want to or not!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Within half an hour, Lilia turned up with Alice and Billy, who all sat around the living room, nervously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So,” Billy trailed off. “You’re an assassin?” He asked, looking at Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What kind of question is that?” Agatha snorted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey!” Rio gasped in faux hurt. “I only kill the bad people. The murderers, y’know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Aren’t you a murderer?” Alice asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There are children in the room,” Lilia pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Billy responded before gasping. “Oh my god. I’ve gotta call my boyfriend. This is my first real mission and he worries about me. If it doesn’t go well, I…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We get it, you have a boyfriend,” Agatha groaned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mommy,” Nicky spoke up. “I’m really scared.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She turned to her son and gave him a worried look. “I know. But we’ll be okay. You will be okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Actually,” Lilia said. “Putting him in a safe room might be the best option. Billy, you go with him.” Billy nodded, standing up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “Jen? Where would that work?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uhh…” Jen murmured, thinking. “The closet?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Billy sat back down. “Oh, no can do. Can’t go back in there.” The group stared at him in annoyance. “Sorry. Tone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You can save your gay jokes for after,” Agatha directed. “Let’s go!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Billy led the younger boy upstairs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right,” Agatha murmured, looking through the weapons the police had brought in. She picked up a gun for herself and looked back at Rio who seemed to be thinking something.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> “This is it,” Rio said, more to herself than anyone else. “I’m free. I can get away from them. It’ll be over.” She wiped her forehead. “Fuck. Why am I sweating?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The group stilled around her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio? You’re not…?” Agatha trailed off, hoping it wasn’t what she thought it was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What? In rut? Nooo,” Rio laughed. “Oh. Shit. That’s due the 21st.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It is the 21st,” Lilia supplied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, assuming it was a joke before freezing. “Really?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This is so awkward,” Jen mumbled as Alice nodded in agreement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can I use your bathroom?” Rio asked Jen, already standing up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not letting some murderous alpha jerk off in my lovely house,” Jen scoffed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jen!” Agatha hissed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine,” Jen hissed. “Door to the left.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a small nod before making an almost animalistic grunting noise in her face. Agatha couldn’t tell what her intention was but it definitely weirded them all out by a lot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’re great with timing, right,” Agatha joked with a snort once the alpha left.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’re so screwed,” Jen stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How?” Agatha scoffed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How? Our best fighter is at a weakness,” Jen said. “On her rut.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who says she's the best fighter,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Her criminal record,” Alice stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can any of us even use guns?” Jen questioned. “I know I haven’t. I mainly joined this job for the aesthetic. Lilia’s bones crunch every time she so much as bends over. Alice is too nice to hurt a fly. Rio’s a horny mess. Agatha’s… Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What does that even mean?” Agatha asked, taking a bite of some food Jen had lying in a bowl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s popurrí,” Jen said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And it’s delicious,” Agatha responded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s not edible,” Alice supplied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let the leaves drop out her mouth. She dusted herself off. “I’m just gonna…” She made her way to the bathroom where she could smell the alpha. She turned the door knob, expecting it to be locked only for it to open.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio greeted her at the door with blown pupils and gasps of need.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey sexy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Never say that again,” Agatha said, taking off her coat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’re you doing?” Rio asked as Agatha closed the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what time the Seven are getting here,” Agatha said, locking it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The Five now,” Rio corrected.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But we’re losing already if you’re in this state,” she said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah?” Rio smirked. “And what’re you gonna do about it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha met her with a stern look. “Get on your knees.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes widened in surprise and excitement before she did as she was told, falling to her knees without hesitation. Her fingers made her way up to the omega’s belt, untying it, letting it fall down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you want to fuck me,” Agatha instructed. “You’re going to show me how good that tongue of yours is first.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned and tugged down the woman’s pants followed by her underwear. She gave her one last look before grabbing Agatha by her thighs and licking a long stripe across her wetness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned lowly and guided Rio’s head to continue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good girl.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio continued, lapping away as if this were her only chance. Maybe it was. Her tongue found its way into her clit, moving in and out with each second. Agatha could feel herself growing more aroused by the second, already dripping wet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio moved a finger in, adding it to the mix, and curled it around. Agatha groaned, shuddering with pleasure as she reached her high. Rio pulled away, awaiting her next command with a smug look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wanted to roll her eyes at the alpha’s grin as she came down from her high. She curled a finger around Rio’s belt loop, tugging her back up, level with her again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Both their breaths were ragged. They didn’t move for another second before capturing each other's lips in a kiss.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled away and fumbled with Rio’s pants zip, eventually tugging it down, as well as her underwear. She took sight of the alpha in front of her, at her length.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She grabbed Rio by the collar, pushing her back against the door. Agatha grabbed Rio’s length, moving her hand up and down it slowly, making the younger woman moan.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So sensitive,” Agatha cooed as she continued. “I haven’t even done anything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You…” Rio panted. “Make me like this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mmm.” She pushed Rio further back against the door, connecting their centers together slightly. She felt the tip brush lightly against her aching core and moaned softly. “I’m not sure you deserve this. I could just leave you here all alone and needy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio growled, riled up from the rut.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shhh,” Agatha whispered, finally pushing herself around the alpha’s cock. She winced in slight pain from the size before letting herself adjust as Rio bottomed out inside her. The pain quickly shifted to pleasure and she slowly started jutting her hips forward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s head fell back as Agatha guided her around in her, each deliberate thrust meeting each other's hips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” Agatha moaned softly as she felt the alpha pulsing inside her. “God, you’re so big.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled quietly, unsure what to do. Any word she said might make the omega stop. She didn’t want her to stop. She needed this desperately.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is this what you’ve wanted, hmm?” Agatha asked with only the wet sounds of each other filling the room as she guided Rio, moving herself up and down on her cock. “Is this what you’ve been craving since the first time we met?” Rio stared at her with dark hooded eyes, grunting in pleasure from the soft strokes. “I never thought you’d be this way. You’d just do anything I’d say, wouldn’t you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio glared at the older woman, before grabbing her by the shoulders, spinning the two around and forcing her against the wall, controlling the pace of their hips together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s head fell back in pleasure. “Fuck. Yes, keep doing that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re so hot,” Rio said again. “Fuck. I’m so close. Gonna fill you right up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, yes,” Agatha moaned, pulling the woman impossibly closer, feeling herself clench around her cock, encouraging Rio to fasten the pace. “Oh my… fuck!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s it, yes, that’s it,” Rio murmured, leaning her head on Agatha’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s wall’s spasmed around her cock, finding her release once again. Rio soon joined her, filling her up with her hot cum. They both slowed down, letting their breaths become even once more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio moved to pull out, letting her cum drip down Agatha’s thighs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Clean me up, will you,” Agatha breathed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded quickly, grabbing the roll of toilet paper, taking a few squares cleaning around the woman’s dripping thighs mixed with both their arousal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good girl,” Agatha spoke again. Rio blushed lightly, placing the paper in the bin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The two separated, quickly pulling their underwear and pants back on, smoothing out their hair and clothes. Rio went to leave the room before Agatha pulled her arm back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Round two?” Rio asked with a quirked brow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What? No,” Agatha scoffed. “I just… wanted to check on you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Me?” Rio questioned. “Is this cause of the smoothie thing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s more than a smoothie,” Agatha said, reminding her of what she said earlier. “Just… I want you to know… you’re more than they say you are. So much more. It pains me that you think you’re not.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sighed. “Thanks. There’s no point though. Now that your cop friends are here, there’s no way I’ll be allowed freedom again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down thinking before looking at Riomagain. “You’re a big girl. You’ve escaped before. Why can’t you again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She then shrugged and walked out the room, followed by Rio. They made their way into the living room, seeing the others' shocked faces.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, sorry about—,” Agatha started before Lilia raised a hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t even,” she said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We heard everything,” Jen said with a look of disgust.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, sitting back down on the couch, sighing contently.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, at least that’s one issue out the way,” Alice pointed out. “No more horny alphas.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“At least not for a while,” Rio added, leaning further back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha grumbled, feeling slightly exposed before sitting down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Now what?” She asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Now we wait,” Lilia said. “The Salem Seven have only recently found us. They need time to regroup. Find our location. Gear up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was a loud thudding at the door. The group sprang up in fear. This was it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The Salem Seven.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The five of them poured into the house, each of them wielding many weapons, instantly facing bullets of the others. They plot around the house, running through the corridors, avoiding the gunshots from the other. Blood splatters painted the floors. Two of them had already died in the car. Now one more joined them.</p><p>Rio laughed like a maniac as she fired bullets over and over, not truly caring who she hit. She grinned as the blood of the Salem few poured and splattered against walls. Already one dead. She cornered another, towering over her with wide gleaming eyes.</p><p>“Waited a long time for this,” she noted as she pulled her dragged out. “How should I do this?” She tapped the dagger against her chin.</p><p>“You’ll never escape us!” They choked out in response. “Even if we all die. You’ll never be free. We’re stuck to you like the roots of your hair.”</p><p>With one final movement the woman pierced Rio’s stomach with a sharp knife, before twisting it and pulling it out.</p><p>Rio screamed in agony, clutching herself before lazily firing the gun at the woman. She scrambled to the bathroom, pulling tissues around the wound as she hissed out in pain.</p><p>She was right. She’d never be free.</p><p>She then heard a scream.</p><p>Agatha!</p><p>Agatha watched as one of Seven marched after her through the corridor. God damn Rio. If she hadn’t stormed off and been spotted by them, they wouldn’t be so caught off guard.</p><p>A bullet hit her on the shoulder.</p><p>“Fuck!” She screamed, grabbing herself before frantically firing until they hit one of them. They grabbed onto their rib where the bullet hit. She fired again, killing them.</p><p>Another jumped onto her holding a knife to her throat. Agatha choked in pain as they pushed before using the force of herself to knee them and point her gun at them.</p><p>The woman she had now cornered cried out as she held her dagger to her neck.</p><p>“Harkness,” a voice called from away. They two women turned their heads to see one of the seven (now two) holding Nicky with an arm around his neck and a gun pointed to his head. His face was red with distress and tears.</p><p>Billy gasped out from behind, blood seeping from his stomach.</p><p>“Nicky!” Agatha screamed.</p><p>“Let’s keep this easy shall we?” The woman holding Nicky snarled, looking over to Agatha still holding her gun to the other woman. “Now. No one move.” There was complete stillness. No one knew what to do. “All this for a woman you met a few months ago. And what? Because she’s the father of your son?”</p><p>Nicky’s eyes widened.</p><p>“How did you know?” Agatha breathed.</p><p>“She may think she has freedom,” the woman stated. “But we have eyes everywhere. How do you think she’d feel knowing her dear son was dead?”</p><p>The gun was pushed closer to the boy.</p><p>“Don’t hurt him!” Agatha wailed.</p><p>“Mama!” Nicky cried.</p><p>“Annoying as always. Just like your father!” She hissed.</p><p>“Rio’s not my father,” Nicky said. “Is she, Mama.”</p><p>Agatha frowned.</p><p>“Oh, so he doesn’t know?”</p><p>“Mama?”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Nicky,” Agatha choked. “Yes… Rio’s your… other parent.”</p><p>Nicky stared at her in confusion and shock before wincing as the gun was angled back at his head.</p><p>“Here’s what’s going to happen,” the woman said. “Hand her to me and the boy will be unharmed, okay.”</p><p>Agatha trembled, still holding her gun to the woman before pushing her over. The woman tripped over herself, returning to her ally’s side.</p><p>“Now hand him over!” Agatha demanded with wet eyes.</p><p>“On second thought,” the woman responded with a click of her tongue. “You’ve killed most of our members and taken our best assassin from us.” She pushed the gun to Nicky’s head. “This should only be fair.”</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two women dropped to the floor as bullets collided with their heads. The one holding Nicky let him go. He instantly ran to his mom, sobbing into her arms.</p><p>She grabbed him and cradled his head, cooing softly as she ran a hand through his hair. She looked up with tear stained eyes to see Rio standing over the two dead bodies panting with ragged breaths and bared teeth.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha sighed out in relief.</p><p>She gave Agatha a small sad smile, before slumping onto the floor as blood poured from her body.</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha wailed.</p><p>Billy, who Agatha had completely forgotten about, pulled himself up, passing the corpses over to Agatha and Nicky.</p><p>“Come on. Let’s go,” he said softly as he tugged at her.</p><p>“No! No!” Agatha begged as Lilia and Alice joined to pull her away. “Rio! Please be okay! Rio please!”</p><p> </p><p>Four months later…</p><p>Agatha stared blankly at the fire crackling away as the flames danced across her eyes. Her fingers crawled across her hands as she let out a small sigh. She gazed at the tv screen with a look of sheer boredom.</p><p>After the events of the Salem Seven, Agatha had decided to cash in her days off and take a break for a while. It gave her more time with Nicky. And time to think. Maybe a little too much thinking.</p><p>She’d decided it was about time to leave Westview. She was having her last goodbyes to the station today and her and Nicky would be on the road. Salem was their direction. It’d be nice for Agatha to see her home place again.</p><p>She felt a familiar rush and quickly made her way to the kitchen, bending over the sink before throwing up. She wiped her mouth and grunted. It had been like this for a few days now.</p><p>Agatha rinsed it away before checking her watch. She had to head to the station now. She rushed to her door, pulling on her work jacket and headed out the house.</p><p>She walked into the station, greeted by Alice and Jen with their usual pleasantries, now with the additional words of comfort and concern.</p><p>“You didn’t have to come back so soon,” Alice tried reassuring.</p><p>“Nothing else to do,” Agatha shrugged. “There’s only so many times you can rewatch Adventure Time with your son before you want to kill yourself.”</p><p>“Well, we’re glad you’re back,” Jen said slowly. “But this might not be the best day for you to say goodbye.”</p><p>“Why’s that?” Agatha asked with narrowed eyes.</p><p>Jen opened her mouth before being interrupted.</p><p>“That’ll be all, Jen. Agatha,” Lilia greeted as she walked in, taking sight of the three women together. “Nice to see you. Will you three follow me to the meeting room?”</p><p>They did so, walking into the room before she shut the door.</p><p>“So…” Agatha started as she took a seat. “Any updates while I’ve been gone… how’s Teen?”</p><p>“Billy’s much better,” Lilia said. “Not so eager about work but in better shape now. The wounds almost completely healed.”</p><p>“Now that the Salem Seven have been taken down,” Lilia spoke. “More of their past workers have been found more easily and we’re taking down many of their drug dealers, money loaners and assassins.”</p><p>Assassins.</p><p>Agatha tensed at the reminder of Rio.</p><p>“So it’s confirmed,” Agatha said. “The Salem Seven are all dead? Officially?”</p><p>“All seven bodies have been confirmed and identified,” Lilia said.</p><p>“And Rio’s?” Agatha asked after a harsh breath.</p><p>“That’s the thing,” Jen said after a pause. “It’s gone. Disappeared. We believe someone who works for the Salem Seven must’ve taken her before the rest of us came up.”</p><p>“You couldn’t find her body?” Agatha asked sharply.</p><p>“This is why we shouldn’t have told her,” Jen hissed.</p><p>“There’s a chance she might still be…” she trailed off before freezing. “No. I saw her bleed out in front of me. I saw her with my own eyes. I didn’t—.” She stood up. “Fuck. I need a minute.” She made her way to the bathroom, throwing up again. She jumped in surprise upon hearing someone behind her.</p><p>“Agatha?” It was Jen. “You alright?”</p><p>“What does it look like Jenny?” Agatha spat through tears.</p><p>Jen paused, noticing her state. “Agatha. Are you…?”</p><p>“Don’t!” Agatha hissed. She knew what Jen was going to ask. The dots were being connected. Her constant throwing up. Her mood swings. She didn’t want to believe it was true. She really didn’t. “Just… don’t.”</p><p>“Can I at least get you a test?” Jen asked.</p><p>“Already got one,” Agatha responded. “Been too scared to take it.”</p><p>“Is… is it hers?” Jen asked.</p><p>Agatha knew who she meant. Rio.</p><p>“Haven’t been with anyone else since,” Agatha stated with a shrug.</p><p>“Are you sure going back to Salem is the best idea?” Jen asked. “At least for now.”</p><p>“Sorry, Jen,” Agatha snorted. “I wasn’t aware you control my whole fucking life.”</p><p>She pushed past her, heading to the door.</p><p>“I’ll see ya,” she murmured, leaving the building.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned as she walked back in the house, after picking Nicky up from school, slumping back on the couch as she ran a hand through her knotted hair. She hadn’t exactly been keeping herself in the best state since it all went down.</p><p>She watched as Nicky ran upstairs to his room. It had taken a while for him to get used to the trauma of what he’d been through. He was now attending regular therapy sessions and kept closer to his mom.</p><p>There had been a moment when Evanora had tried to gain custody of him, claiming that it was unsafe for him to stay with Agatha, but it was declined.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip before finally pushing herself into the bathroom and took the test. She waited for the lines to show. There they were. Two lines. Positive. She was pregnant again.</p><p>“Fuck.”</p><p>Due to being an omega, Agatha was still just as fertile now in her late 40s as she had been years ago when she had Nicky.</p><p>There was a thud from upstairs and Agatha’s eyes widened. She raced upstairs and swung open Nicky’s door. He jumped in surprise.</p><p>“What?” He asked worriedly.</p><p>“Oh. I thought I heard… I thought…” she breathed.</p><p>“Sorry,” he apologised. “I got angry with the game.”</p><p>She shook her head and let out a tired sigh. “No. No. It’s fine… listen, Mommy’s gonna go for a quick nap in her room. I’ll make dinner in an hour.”</p><p>Nicky nodded. “Okay.”</p><p>She turned her attention to a drawing up on Nicky’s wall. He wasn’t exactly an artist but she could make out the idea. Three stick figures under a house with a shining sun and happy faces. Nicky, Agatha and Rio.</p><p>They were labelled ‘me, mama, papa’.</p><p>Agatha felt sick. She made her way to her room and laid down on her bed, eventually dozing off as one of her arms dangled off the bed.</p><p>Suddenly something grabbed her, pulling her down. She crashed onto the carpet before two legs straddled her around her waist and pinned her to the floor. Their arms made their way to Agatha’s pushing them up, unable to defend herself.</p><p>Agatha screamed and kicked, before looking at them. They wore a skull mask that covered their entire face and wore mainly black around their body.</p><p>“Get off me!”</p><p>“Shhh… Nicky will hear you,” the person said, lowering herself closer to Agatha so that their faces were almost touching. “Don’t you recognise me, Agatha?”</p><p>The person took the mask off, letting their hair fall back and Agatha finally got a look at her face.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>“Rio! You’re - you -. Fuck! What the hell are you doing?” Agatha gasped out in shock.</p><p>“Lost for words, m'lady?” Rio grinned before moving upwards to sit on Agatha’s lap. “This wasn’t how I was expecting our reunion.”</p><p>“You’re alive?” Agatha finally choked out.</p><p>Rio did a quick once over of herself. “I think so.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha grunted. “I saw you bleed out. I saw you die. I saw your body.”</p><p>“And was the body found by the police?” Rio questioned.</p><p>Agatha frowned. “I mean… they never mentioned…”</p><p>“If I were to have simply lived… I would’ve been arrested. I’d break out. They arrested me again. The cycle would continue as long as I’d live. So… I died.”</p><p>“But you’re not dead,” Agatha pointed out sheepishly.</p><p>Rio chuckled. “To be fair. I was actually stabbed. Hurt like a bitch too,” she said, taking Agatha’s hand moving it up her shirt to caress her stomach and sure enough a scar that still seemed to be healing was there.</p><p>“Why wait until now?” Agatha asked as she continued stroking her skin. “Why only now you come to find me? Why… have you come to find me?”</p><p>Rio paused, unable to find words for once. “I wanted to see you. I want… you.” Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “And you want me too, right?” Rio chuckled uncertainly. “Right? You want me. Say it.”</p><p>“Get off me,” Agatha simply said.</p><p>Rio obliged, getting up, allowing Agatha to stand. “Why don’t you want me? Huh?”</p><p>“I’m about to leave Westview in three days,” Agatha hissed. “And you show up now?”</p><p>“Would you rather I let you believe I was dead?”</p><p>“Well, you kind of did,” Agatha snorted.</p><p>“But I’m here now,” Rio spoke softly. She took Agatha’s hand, stroking it softly with her thumb.</p><p>“Why do you care for me?” Agatha asked. “I’ve done nothing for you. You don’t have a heart.”</p><p>“I do have a heart,” Rio argued.</p><p>“No you don’t,” Agatha scoffed.</p><p>“Yes I do,” Rio said firmly. “And it beats for you.”</p><p>Fuck. Why did that do something for Agatha. She was supposed to hate this woman. This arrogant murderous alpha. Yet she felt herself grow soft. Warm. She didn’t know what was going to happen.</p><p>“I could go right now,” Rio said. “And you’ll never see me again. But you’ll keep seeing my face. Through him. I’ll always be here. No matter what. You’ll never get away from your love.”</p><p>“You make it sound romantic,” Agatha pointed out. “But those are nothing but threats.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Maybe it is. Maybe it isn’t. I’ve been doing this job for a while. My whole life. Never have I been hurt before. Until you. You Agatha… are my scar.” She glanced down at her stomach with the healing mark. “Literally.”</p><p>“Rio stop!” Agatha interrupted her firmly. Rio shut her mouth, listening to Agatha speak. “I need to tell you something…” She hesitated. “I’m pregnant.”</p><p>“You cheated on me?!” Rio shrieked in horror.</p><p>“What? No!” Agatha groaned. “I haven’t been with anyone since- fuck. Let me rephrase this.” She breathed out. “I'm pregnant with your child… again.”</p><p>“You’re pregnant?!” Another voice shouted from the door. Nicky stood there awkwardly, holding a toy car in one hand. He took sight of Rio, who quickly removed herself from Agatha. “Rio! You came back!” He rushed into her arms, crying out with a voice of glee. “Are you staying forever?”</p><p>Agatha froze. She looked at Rio. And Nicky.</p><p>“Just… just give me a minute,” Agatha said, stumbling over herself as she left the room before standing outside the house in the back garden. She trusted Rio enough to leave her with their son now.</p><p>Their son? Since when was she calling him that?</p><p>Someone cleared her throat behind her.</p><p>“You okay?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Of course I’m not. I’ve quit my job, I’m moving away, not to mention I’m pregnant. You’re back!” She listed hysterically.</p><p>She stared at Rio. The woman who’d caused her so much the past few months. Put herself, Agatha and their son at risk. Interrupted her work, ruined her reputation with her colleagues, not to mention her smoothie maker!</p><p>Yet she could only look at Rio with softness, warmth and hope. She’d changed her life. In more ways than one. She cared for her son. Sacrificed herself for the two.</p><p>Agatha moved forward, cupping Rio’s face before speaking softly.</p><p>“Never leave me again.”</p><p>Rio smiled softly. “Never.”</p>
