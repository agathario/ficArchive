<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hello! If you follow me on Twitter, you'll know that I've been working on this piece for a couple of weeks. It's almost finished, but after listening to feedback from my readers, I've decided to turn it into a GP fanfic.</p><p>I've always wanted to create a Rio GP story—there are already so many amazing tales in this fandom with this theme. From the beginning, this idea was at the forefront of my mind. So, I've started reworking it and, since I'm too excited to wait, I wanted to share what I've developed so far.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The jungle gave way to rot.</p><p>Agatha Harkness stood at the edge of the inlet, salt wind winding through the tall grasses and pressing against the heavy navy folds of her dress. The ruined ship before her loomed like a corpse half-buried in sand, its hull split, ribs of wood exposed to the sky like bones. The air was heavy with mildew and old magic—stale, clinging, and bitter. Something still pulsed inside.</p><p>A good sign.</p><p>She stepped aboard with care, boots clicking softly on moss-slick wood. Inside, the corridors whispered with dust and shadows. It was like walking into a memory long-forgotten by time.</p><p>At the back of the ship, in what must have once been the captain’s quarters, the old woman lay slumped across a velvet chaise. Esmerelda.</p><p>Once the great enchantress of the travelling dark circus, infamous across continents. Her circus of freaks, curses, and illusions had been whispered about even in Salem. But now—nothing more than a dying crone hiding among drift and ghosts.</p><p>“You’re too late, <em>bruja</em>. I’m already half in the grave.”</p><p>Her hair had gone white and wiry, skin folding over itself like crumpled parchment. Bangles still clung to skeletal wrists, but they jangled weakly as she lifted a shaking hand toward Agatha.</p><p>“You’ve outlasted your legend,” Agatha said, stepping closer.</p><p>The air suddenly cracked green.</p><p>A spell, desperate and bitter, flew at her like a slap. Agatha met it with a cool flick of her fingers, purple magic spiralling to consume it midair.</p><p>She didn’t even blink.</p><p>“You should’ve hidden better.”</p><p>Her hand came up and her magic reached out—deep, coiling, greedy. It sank into Esmerelda’s chest like smoke, and the old witch shrieked once before the light began to leave her. The power—the pieces left, anyway—was drawn into Agatha’s waiting palm in dim, flickering streams.</p><p>When it ended, Esmerelda slumped back, unmoving. The room went still.</p><p>Agatha exhaled. “Damn. Barely enough to warm my hands.”</p><p>She turned and searched the room. Behind thick drapes and rotting books, she found what she’d come for: the grimoire. Bound in cracked black leather, old as sin. The eye stamped on the cover stared back, blind and red.</p><p>She tucked it beneath her arm, triumphant—but paused.</p><p>All around her were remnants of a different life: torn posters curling on the floorboards, trunks filled with carnival silks and strange masks. A world of illusion and wonder now turned to dust. She knelt and picked one up.</p><p><em>LA MUJER LOBO</em>, it read.<br/>
<em>La Fiera del Bosque</em><br/>
<em>RIO – La Bestia Imposible</em></p><p>The drawing showed a girl mid-snarl—shoulders hunched, arms outstretched like claws, hair wild, teeth bared. Around her throat, a thick iron collar glinting darkly.</p><p>Agatha studied the image.</p><p>Then—something stirred.</p><p>A faint sound, barely more than a whimper. Animal. From below.</p><p>She turned.</p><p>The lower decks were darker, slick with water damage and sea-slime. The sound came again—softer now. A breath, a scrape of chain. She followed it.</p><p>Down a narrow stair and past a rusted iron grate, she found her.</p><p>Crouched in the shadows, chained to the floor by thick blackened iron, was a girl.</p><p>No—something not quite girl.</p><p>Her skin was sun-browned, streaked with dirt and dried blood. Bare feet pressed against the damp planks. Her legs, corded with muscle, were folded beneath her in a crouch, like an animal in wait. Her back rose and fell with slow, silent breath. Her arms—powerful, too long, too strong—braced her to the floor like she might spring forward at any moment.</p><p>The hair hung in long black mats around her face, tangled and half-covering the glint of her eyes. Deep brown—no, gold around the edges. Like they had once belonged to something with fangs and claws.</p><p>The collar around her neck was rusted, ancient, and etched with green runes that pulsed faintly. A dull ache of dark magic radiated from it.</p><p>And her body— undeniably female in some ways, yet bearing what the circus had once hidden, exploited, and branded as monstrous. Between her legs, she was marked with the truth of it: not just a girl, not just a beast, but a creature the world had never known how to name.  Not that it mattered. Not here. </p><p>Agatha stepped closer.</p><p>The girl’s head twitched toward her.</p><p>Eyes locked. And for a moment, Agatha felt a presence behind those eyes—something old, deeper than human thought. Wild. Dangerous. Not broken. Contained.</p><p>Only barely.</p><p>She was filthy. Beautiful in a ruined, feral sort of way. Her chest rose and fell with slow, tense rhythm. Her body was both tense and graceful, as though she could leap or lunge in the same breath.</p><p>Agatha knelt.</p><p>She reached a gloved hand toward the collar.</p><p>The moment her fingers brushed the metal, it flared with green fire. A crackle snapped up her arm. She hissed and pulled away, fingers singed.</p><p>A curse. A strong one. It wasn’t meant to be removed. Not by just anyone.</p><p>No wonder Esmerelda kept her.</p><p>Agatha rose to her feet, eyes narrowing. There was so much magic buried in this creature. Compressed like coals waiting for a flame. And yet there was more than that.</p><p>Something stirred in her gut.</p><p>She’d come for power. A grimoire. A legend to dismantle. But now— </p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>She should leave the girl. Dangerous. Cursed. Half- feral.</p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>Because Agatha knew what it meant to be bound and used. She knew what it meant to be made into something unnatural and punished for surviving it. And somehow, looking at the girl beneath her— the way she didn’t beg, didn’t cover, didn’t speak…</p><p>Agatha felt the faintest pull.</p><p>Not pity.</p><p>Not mercy.</p><p>Recognition.</p><p>She raised her hand and, with a whisper, sent violet light slicing through the rusted chains. They fell with a heavy, reluctant sound. The collar remained.</p><p>Agatha summoned a spell into her palm—thread-thin, silver-violet—and cast it forward. It curled like a leash, wrapping once around the girl’s collar. It didn’t burn. It pulsed, gently, like breath.</p><p>The girl sniffed at it. Her shoulders flexed. A low, near-silent growl hummed in her throat.</p><p>But she followed.</p><p>One step. Then another.</p><p>Agatha didn’t smile, but her eyes sparked with something ancient and delighted.</p><p>This was no mere pet Esmerelda had hidden. This was power. Untapped. Untamed. </p><p>But maybe, just maybe…</p><p>This was something Agatha didn’t want to leave behind.</p><p>Not because she needed her.</p><p>Because she chose her.</p><p>Agatha turned, leading her toward the jungle.</p><p>The girl followed on bare, silent feet—no chains now, but no freedom either. Something worse. Something more.</p><p>And far behind them, the cursed ship began to sink.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>
It took three days to reach the manor.</p><p>Agatha didn’t sleep on the journey. She rarely did, not in places like this—where the vines grew thicker than walls, and the insects whispered secrets older than language. The jungle closed around them like a throat. Above, parrots screamed. Below, the ground steamed with decay.</p><p>And always, behind her, came Rio.</p><p>She moved in silence, barefoot through mud and root, never tripping, never falling behind. At night, Agatha would make camp and set wards in a circle of violet flame. Rio would curl in a corner like a hound—shoulders hunched, eyes glinting from the dark. She did not sleep. She <em>watched</em>.</p><p>The collar still pulsed faintly with green magic. Agatha could feel it from across the camp. A hum of restraint. A prison layered over flesh and soul.</p><p>The manor was hidden in the hills—abandoned by whatever colonial fool had built it and left behind crumbling walls and ivy-choked arches. Agatha had claimed it for her own years ago, knowing she’d need a place far from civilisation. It was half-eaten by the jungle, moss spreading over stone like skin, but it held a library, an altar room, and space for quiet work.</p><p>Rio stepped over the threshold like a ghost entering its tomb.</p><p>Inside, Agatha lit floating purple lights that followed her movements. She watched Rio pad across the tile floor—her feet smudging dirt where she walked, her head low, alert. Still crouched, still watchful, like some part of her couldn’t decide if this was a new cage or a hunting ground.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head.</p><p>“Beautiful little creature,” she murmured under her breath.</p><p>In the library, the grimoire rested atop an obsidian plinth. She had not yet dared open it. Not while traveling. Not with something like <em>her</em> so close.</p><p>Now, with the manor sealed and the jungle silenced, Agatha stood before it.</p><p>She flicked a wrist. The book opened.</p><p>Pages whispered. Old leather cracked.</p><p>Symbols burned. Languages long dead twisted over the parchment like vines of ink.</p><p>And there—halfway through—etched into parchment with what looked like claw scratches and dried blood, she found it.</p><p><strong>The Binding of the Beast</strong>.</p><p>A spell. A ritual. Not just for werewolves, but for a breed older, rarer. Lycanthropy that didn’t begin with a bite or curse, but something primal. <em>Inherited. Birthed</em>. Bloodline magic. Divine and monstrous.</p><p>The collar was not Esmerelda’s doing. It predated even her.</p><p>Agatha glanced up.</p><p>Rio was on the floor by the window, one leg stretched long, arms wrapped around her knees. Her hair hung like a curtain. Her eyes met Agatha’s—and something passed between them. A flicker of something unspoken.</p><p>Curiosity.</p><p>Hunger.</p><p>Recognition.</p><p>Agatha closed the book and approached. She crouched, inches away, and let the tips of her fingers trail just near Rio’s jaw—hovering, not touching.</p><p>“Do you remember who did this to you?” she asked softly.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer. She tilted her head.</p><p>Agatha reached toward the collar again.</p><p>This time, she touched the metal with both hands, channeling power from her core—<em>not to remove it</em>, but to listen. The magic buzzed through her like bees in her blood. The collar fought her—refused to reveal its secrets—but she caught a flash of something:</p><p>Moonlight. A stone altar. Screaming. Claws. A woman—another witch—whispering in a language she didn’t recognise.</p><p>Agatha reeled back.</p><p>Rio tensed.</p><p>“I see,” Agatha breathed. “Someone feared you.”</p><p>She stood.</p><p>She would need blood to unlock the collar’s spell. A moon ritual. Possibly a key forged in bone. She’d need to prepare. But more than that… she would need Rio’s trust.</p><p>Or at least her obedience.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That night, Agatha filled the bathing chamber with steaming water. Herbs. Crushed salt. She called for Rio with a whisper of magic—and the girl appeared, silent and waiting in the archway.</p><p>Agatha turned, holding out a piece of soft cloth and a bar of soap. The light in the room glowed violet, shadows pooling like velvet at their feet.</p><p>Rio’s eyes scanned the water, then Agatha.</p><p>“You’re filthy,” Agatha said simply. “Let me see you properly.”</p><p>She didn’t flinch as Rio stepped forward and stripped. </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. </p><p>She hadn’t expected, or perhaps tried not to expect, what that body held.</p><p>Strength, yes. That was obvious in the way Rio moved, even half caged. But bare now, she was carved from a raw and earthy beauty— her musculature lean, long, functional, not ornamental. She looked like something raised by trees and storms, every inch of her built for survival, for pursuit, for fury.<br/>
And then— her eyes flickered lower. For a second, no more, Agatha faltered. </p><p>She had known, technically about Rio’s body. She had noticed, without intending to, the way the girl stood to relieve herself just past the warding line. It hadn’t surprised her so much as it had lodged itself in her thoughts— quietly, persistently. </p><p>Rio’s body bore both softness and assertion, curves shadowed with muscle and scars. And between her legs, a cock hung heavy and natural as breath— unashamed, untouched by modesty. A part of her, simply. Not hidden. Not explained. A trust the world would’ve tried to break.</p><p>Heat bloomed in Agatha’s cheeks before she could stop it.</p><p>Her sharp mind, so rarely undone, flickered— then recovered. </p><p>There were scars. Thin and deliberate. Others jagged and old. Her back bone the faintest silver mark of what might’ve once been claws. </p><p>Her thighs were thick with muscle. Her shoulders broader than expected. Her hands calloused and ready. All of it- all of it- housed beneath that cruel, ancient collar. Still pulsing. Still trying to make her small. </p><p>No wonder they feared her. </p><p>Agatha let her gaze linger longer than she meant to. Long enough that something hot and unfamiliar stirred in her ribs. </p><p>She had seen many forms of power. </p><p>But never one so bodied. </p><p>Rio stepped into the bath without a word. </p><p>Agatha watched as the steam curled around her, as the dirt bled from her skin in swirls. She approached slowly, kneeling by the bath’s edge, dipping the cloth into the water and reaching out.</p><p>She began to wash her.</p><p>Not with tenderness. But with reverence. As one might wash a weapon before a ritual. Her hands moved slowly over shoulders, across the nape of Rio’s neck, around the curve of her spine. The collar hummed with each touch but did not resist.</p><p>“You were made for more than cages,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Rio’s breath deepened. Her eyes half-lidded. Not trust, but… stillness.</p><p>A beginning.</p><p>And far above them, the moon was beginning to rise.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>
The rain started suddenly, as it often did in the jungle—like the sky had been holding its breath all day and finally exhaled. A hot, hard downpour that rattled every tile of the old manor roof and filled the air with the scent of wet leaves and crushed stone.</p><p>Agatha Harkness sat cross-legged in the library, sleeves pushed to her elbows, violet magic humming softly over the open grimoire. Her ink-stained fingers hovered over the pages, eyes scanning lines of blood-bound runes and ancient wolf rites.</p><p>She’d been reading the same paragraph for nearly ten minutes.</p><p>Truthfully, she couldn’t focus— not entirely. The grimoire was priceless, the magic scrawled across its hide-bound pages older than even she was— but her mind kept drifting. Not far, just… to the next room. To the floorboards that creaked faintly when someone shifted their weight. To the subtle hum she\d begun to associate not with danger, but with proximity. With her. </p><p>She didn’t notice the figure in the doorway at first.</p><p>But she <em>felt</em> her.</p><p>Rio’s presence was always more scent and instinct than sound. A shift in the air pressure. A low thrum beneath the skin. Like an animal in the wild, watching from the edge of the trees.</p><p>Agatha looked up.</p><p>There she was.</p><p>Soaked from head to toe, dark hair clinging to her face, her oversized shift plastered to her frame. Barefoot. Silent. The collar gleamed wetly at her throat. Her eyes, wide and dark and uncertain, flicked between Agatha and the fire crackling nearby.</p><p>Gods, she was striking. Even now, dripping and tense as a wire, there was a kind of grace to her— brutal, unstudied, and entirely her own. Her stillness wasn’t hesitation. It was calculation. She didn’t shiver, didn’t tremble. She assessed.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze softened despite herself. </p><p>“You came in from the rain,” she murmured, more to herself than to Rio.</p><p>The girl stayed in the doorway. Unmoving. A silent silhouette.</p><p>How many thresholds had she crossed, Agatha wondered, only to be punished on the other side?</p><p>She closed the book gently and stood. Her dress robes whispered around her legs as she moved to the hearth and knelt, feeding a few dry herbs into the fire. A plume of scent rose—lavender, myrrh, a thread of something Rio might remember from childhood even if she didn’t know why.</p><p>She deserves to remember softness, Agatha thought. </p><p>Then, softly, without turning: “Come closer. You’ll warm faster.”</p><p>No command. No coaxing spell. Just space.</p><p>A long beat of silence.</p><p>Then—quiet footsteps. Wet against stone.</p><p>Rio crossed the room like a half-wild thing trying to decide if she was entering a trap. She lowered herself beside the fire with her usual graceful crouch, long limbs folding in on themselves, chin tucked near her collarbone. Steam rose from her skin.</p><p>She never just sat. She coiled. Ready to spring. Ready to run. </p><p>Agatha pulled the heavy woollen throw from the back of the chair and carefully draped it over Rio’s shoulders. The girl didn’t flinch.</p><p>That alone felt like a miracle.</p><p>Agatha sat beside her—not too close. Just near enough for the firelight to wrap them both in its soft, amber glow. She reached into a nearby basket and offered a piece of sliced mango on a cloth.</p><p>Rio blinked at it.</p><p>Sniffed it, slow.</p><p>Then—bit, cautiously. Juice ran down her fingers.</p><p>She chewed with the same silence she did everything with, but Agatha saw something new in her face now: <em>not fear</em>.</p><p>Just quiet.</p><p>It was working, Agatha realised. Not her magic, at least, not the kind she could measure. Not spells. Not control. But something simpler. Consistency. Kindness. Proximity. She wasn’t sure when the urger to keep rio close had shifted from strategic to something intimate. But it had. Somewhere between the jungle and the bath. Somewhere between wariness and wonder.</p><p>The storm battered at the windows. The flames danced. Rain dripped down the arches like threads of glass.</p><p>And slowly, like a creature adjusting to the safety of stillness, Rio shifted closer.</p><p>Her shoulder brushed Agatha’s.</p><p>A pause.</p><p>Then her temple pressed, very gently, against the side of Agatha’s arm.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move. Her breath stayed slow. She didn’t dare ruin the moment.</p><p>Up close, Rio smelled like rain and moss and something darker—like fur warmed by fire. Her body radiated heat, and her weight, even in this tentative lean, made Agatha feel small. Human. Mortal.</p><p>But she didn’t feel unsafe.</p><p>She felt… tethered.</p><p>Agatha slowly brought a hand up—carefully—and ran her fingers through the damp tangles of Rio’s hair. Each pass was slow. Gentle. Tension uncoiled under her fingertips like thread.</p><p>Rio let out a soft, involuntary noise. A sound that wasn’t a growl or a warning.</p><p>It was almost… a whimper.</p><p>Not of pain.</p><p>Of relief.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes.</p><p>“You’ve been alone for a long time, haven’t you,” she murmured. “Even before Esmerelda.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer. But her weight leaned more heavily against her now. Head bowed. Hands limp in her lap. She wasn’t asleep, but she was somewhere close to it.</p><p>Agatha didn’t try to move her. She wouldn’t have been able to lift her anyway—Rio was all muscle and solid wildness, even curled up like this.</p><p>Instead, Agatha adjusted the blanket around her shoulders and reached for another, laying it gently over Rio’s bent knees. Her own lap stayed still beneath the girl’s head.</p><p>This was not how she had imagined this journey.</p><p>She’d come for power. For the grimoire. For relics that would make her unstoppable.</p><p>But now, with this soaked, silent creature curled beside her like a half-grown pup, warm and trembling and almost-trusting…</p><p>Agatha felt something else stirring. </p><p>Not weakness. </p><p>But softness that refused to be weakness. </p><p>A new kind of magic. One she couldn’t control.</p><p>And she wasnt sure if it terrified her— or if she wanted to lean into it completely. </p><p>⸻</p><p>The storm had passed sometime during the night, leaving behind a heavy hush— like the jungle itself was still half-asleep. The scent of rain lingered in the stone corridors, softening the usual sharpness of Agatha’s wards and herbs. Sunlight filtered through the broken shutters in golden shards, catching on dust motes that floated lazily through the air. </p><p>Agatha stirred on the old velvet chaise, robes rumpled, a book still open beside her. </p><p>She blinked, then remembered why her shoulder ached. </p><p>Rio.</p><p>Still pressed against her, head resting heavily just above her hip, limbs folded neatly in a curl like a sleeping dog at the hearth. Her breath was even, slow, her hair fanned over the fabric and one of Agatha’s legs. The woollen blanket had slipped, half draped over both of them.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move right away. She watched. </p><p>There was something beautiful in the stillness. In the trust that had to exist for this to be happening- for rio to be asleep., beside another living being, vulnerable and warm. No growl. No tension. Just heat and weight and a deep, quiet calm.</p><p>A week ago, she’d been a shadow in the ship’s hold. And now… this.  </p><p>Agatha reached up and gently brushed a few strands of hair from Rio’s face.</p><p>“You’re almost charming like this,” she murmured dryly. “Emphasis on almost.”</p><p>Rio stirred. A soft exhale, a twitch of her hand against the hem of Agatha’s robe. Then her lashes fluttered and she blinked awake, disoriented for half a breath before her body remembered the rules, alert, tense, still. </p><p>But Agatha didn’t move. And neither did Rio.</p><p>Instead, slowly— cautiously— Rio sat up, stretching long legs out in front of her, spine rolling like a cat’s. She sniffed the air once, twice, then stood in a single fluid motion. Barefoot, silent, half shadow.</p><p>Agatha let her go. Just watched, amused. </p><p>Rio passed into the library alcove near the table, where breakfast had been laid out earlier by one of the Anor’s old enchantments, fruit, flatbread, dried meats, and a pot of tea that was now lukewarm. She bypassed all of that.</p><p>And instead— of course- - went straight for a small decorative bowl filled with potpourri.</p><p>Agatha’s brow rose.</p><p>Rio picked it up delicately, sniffed the dried flowers and orange peels like they were suspicious game. Then satisfied, she plucked out a shrivelled violet petal and popped it in her mouth.</p><p>Agatha sat bolt upright. “Oh no, no. absolutely not—“</p><p>She was across the room in seconds, swiping the bowl from Rio’s hands before she could attempt another bite. </p><p>Rio looked up at her, blankly. Then frowned. The smallest, most offended little grunt left her throat.</p><p>“It’s not food,” Agatha said, exasperated. “It smells nice. Thats the point. Do not eat my decor.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, narrowed her eyes, and then pointed at the potpourri bowl like she was accusing it of misleading her. </p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched. “Yes, I agree. Its deceptive. Now sit down and try something that won’t shrivel your intestines.”</p><p>She pushed a piece of melon into Rio’s hand, who sniffed it mournfully before eating it in a single bite. Agatha sighed, but her expression had softened. Something warm settled in her chest. The absurdity of it all— the wild, magical creature in her home, the chewing on decorative petals and glowering at fruit—</p><p>It felt like a life she hadn’t known she missed.</p><p>They settled near the hearth again, the sun catching Rio’s unruly curls. Agatha poured herself a cup of tea, flicking a warming charm over it absently.</p><p>Rio watched, then leaned over and gently, experimentally, sniffed Agatha’s cup.</p><p>Agatha paused. “No, you cant eat the teacup either.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed like she didn’t quite believe her.</p><p>And then— barely, briefly— Agatha caught the tiniest shift in her lips. </p><p>A smile.</p><p>A real one. Just a flicker. Gone almost before it appeared. </p><p>But Agatha saw it. And she felt it like a thread pulled taut in her chest.</p><p>She leaned back agains t the chaise and let her eyes close briefly.</p><p>“You’re going to be the death of me,” she muttered. </p><p>Beside her, Rio curled her legs up under her again, eyes half lidded, warm and watchful.</p><p>Not a beast. Not a pet.</p><p>Something in between.</p><p><br/>
——<br/>
Later that morning, after the hearth had burned low and the shadows had softened into afternoon haze, Agatha found herself in her study, pretending to read.</p><p>She wasn’t reading.</p><p>Her eyes skimmed the same paragraph three times before she gave up entirely, setting the book aside and glancing across the room.</p><p>Rio was crouched by the balcony, where the jungle murmured softly just beyond the broken balustrade. One hand rested on the warm stone, the other played idly with a dead beetle she’d found—a glossy, iridescent thing that she kept rolling between her fingers like a marble.</p><p>Agatha watched her.</p><p>That low hum of power was still there. It had been present since the ship. Ancient. Coiled tight around her ribs, her limbs. It wasn’t witch-magic, not in the traditional sense—not chanted or cast or shaped by will. But it was there.<em> Living</em>. Sleeping, perhaps. Waiting.</p><p>She set her teacup down and rose.</p><p>“Come,” she said gently.</p><p>Rio’s head lifted, eyes narrowing just slightly. She didn’t move at first.</p><p>So Agatha turned, robes brushing the floor, and walked to the centre of the room where the warding circle was faintly etched in the tile—old, faded, harmless. Decorative now, more or less. A memory of her own experiments. She knelt and drew her hand across the runes, whispering softly.</p><p>Violet light pulsed, spreading slowly outward.</p><p>Behind her, she heard Rio move.</p><p>She came on quiet feet, curious but cautious, the beetle still pinched gently between her fingers. She crouched a few feet away, just outside the circle, watching as the runes shimmered and twisted. Not afraid—just… measuring.</p><p>Agatha sat back on her heels. “Do you know what this is?”</p><p>No answer. Just a tilt of the head.</p><p>“It’s harmless,” she said. “Now. But it used to trap lesser spirits. I thought you might… respond to something in it.”</p><p>She lifted one hand and shaped a flicker of spellfire—something soft, playful. A flame no hotter than a breath, curling around her fingers like a snake of light. She let it rise into the air, then shaped it into a hummingbird. It darted once in a loop, wings flickering violet.</p><p>Rio’s eyes tracked it instantly.</p><p>Agatha smiled.</p><p>She guided the bird closer to Rio, slow and careful, and watched as Rio held perfectly still—then, with a single flick of her wrist, <em>snatched</em> it from the air.</p><p>The bird dissolved harmlessly into sparkles. Rio blinked, surprised. Then looked at her empty hand. Then at Agatha.</p><p>And something passed over her face—brief, but unmistakable.</p><p><em>Amusement</em>.</p><p>Agatha raised a brow. “So you can be entertained.”</p><p>Rio made a soft, low grunt that almost—<em>almost</em>—sounded like a laugh. She dropped the beetle gently beside her and leaned forward, tapping one claw-tipped finger on the glowing edge of the warding circle.</p><p>The light flared where she touched it.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>That shouldn’t happen. Not unless—</p><p>She rose carefully and reached for another spell, a simple light-binding charm. She cast it like a net, letting it hover above Rio’s head—not to trap, but to test. To taste the shape of the air around her.</p><p>The net hovered for a moment—then folded in on itself and <em>snapped</em>, burning away in a crackle of silver sparks.</p><p>Rio flinched.</p><p>Agatha didn’t.</p><p>She stepped closer.</p><p>“You unraveled it,” she said softly. “Without touching it.”</p><p>Rio looked at her.</p><p>There was no comprehension on her face—but also no confusion. As though her body knew the truth her mind had forgotten.</p><p>Agatha crouched beside her again. Not quite within arm’s reach, but close enough that she could see the way Rio’s pupils shifted in the light. The gold in them catching.</p><p>“You’re not just old magic,” she whispered. “You<em> are</em> magic.”</p><p>Rio blinked once, slow. Then lowered her gaze to the floor like she was embarrassed by it. Or maybe simply disinterested.</p><p>Agatha felt the ache behind her ribs again. That strange pull.</p><p>She reached out, slow as dusk, and brushed a knuckle along the edge of Rio’s jaw. Rio didn’t flinch—but she didn’t lean into it either.</p><p>Still. It was something.</p><p>“You’re not a beast,” Agatha said, voice low. “They only told you that to keep you caged.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. Her lips parted slightly. Not to speak—she never spoke—but Agatha thought she saw the effort of it. The thought of a word. Or a sound that had shape. One that had once belonged to her.</p><p>But then she closed her mouth again, and simply sat there, watching the dying glow of the circle between them.</p><p>Agatha stood and brushed the dust from her hands.</p><p>“I’ll show you something better tomorrow,” she said lightly. “Something older. I think you’ll like it.”</p><p>Rio didn’t nod. Didn’t move.</p><p>But as Agatha turned away, she caught something from the corner of her eye.</p><p>Rio had drawn one finger through the dust beside her.</p><p>A shape.</p><p>A single rune. Jagged. Crooked.</p><p>But unmistakable.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>It was the first mark in the spell she’d found in the grimoire.</p><p>
<em>The Binding of the Beast.</em>
</p><p>Not forgotten, then.</p><p>Just… buried.</p><p>She turned to look at Rio—but Rio was already standing again, stretching lazily, spine curving like smoke, eyes on the door like she might return to her beetle-hunting.</p><p>Agatha let her go.</p><p>——-</p><p> </p><p>It began with a smell.</p><p>Smoke, on the wind.</p><p>Agatha sat on the library floor, glyphs chalked carefully into a ritual circle, the grimoire open beside her, violet ink glowing on her fingers. Her senses twitched before her body did—something wrong in the air, not jungle smoke, not incense or storm, but <em>torch fire</em>. And underneath it, iron.</p><p>Steel. Sweat. Men.</p><p>She stood at once. Her pulse flared, not from fear, but from instinct. Rage. How dare they.</p><p>“Rio.<em> Hide</em>!”</p><p>The girl was perched in the high arch of the ruined west window, watching birds beyond the canopy, half-crouched like a wildcat. She turned at the sound of her name, nostrils flaring. Her head snapped toward the trees.</p><p>She growled.</p><p>They came fast.</p><p>Witch hunters were not elegant. They were brutal and efficient—men with swords and boots and salt in their mouths. Most hadn’t seen a real witch in years, only stories. They weren’t prepared for someone like Agatha.</p><p>But there were <em>so many</em>.</p><p>The first shattered the outer wards with brute force. The second lobbed something into the courtyard—a glass sphere that exploded in a burst of silver shrapnel and holy ash.</p><p>Agatha roared a counter spell, fingers slicing violet light through the air. One man burst into flame before he crossed the threshold. Another screamed as his blood turned to smoke inside him.</p><p>But the others kept coming.</p><p>Ten. Twelve. Fifteen. They moved like a pack—stabbing at sigils, burning herbs into the ground to poison her magic. Some bore relics, others prayer-tattooed skin. She killed two more in seconds, but her breath was ragged. Her wards were failing.</p><p>A graze tore across her shoulder, hot and fast. She stumbled back toward the alter room, pain singing in her ribs. </p><p>She was calculating the next spell when the floor trembled behind her.</p><p>A sound like thunder on paws.</p><p>Agatha turned.</p><p>Rio was there.</p><p>She had not transformed—<em>could not</em>, not with the collar still locked around her throat—but it didn’t matter.</p><p>She <em>charged</em>.</p><p>And Agatha, for a brief, sharp second, forgot how to breathe.</p><p>She moved faster than human. Than witch. Her feet barely touched the floor before she was on the first man, snapping his neck with one hand, tearing the sword from another and ramming it through his gut. A third hunter swung toward her—she caught his wrist midair and<em> ripped it off</em>.</p><p>Blood sprayed the stone walls.</p><p>Her eyes glowed gold now, her teeth bared. She <em>howled</em>, and even Agatha felt it in her bones—deep, primordial fear.</p><p>They tried to run.</p><p>Rio didn’t let them.</p><p>One by one, she tore through them. Blades shattered against her skin. Silver burned—but she didn’t stop. She slammed one man into a pillar hard enough to break both. Another she gutted with her bare hands.</p><p>Agatha stood rooted in place, spell half-formed on her lips, her hands slick with blood and magic, and all she could do was watch.</p><p>Not because she couldnt help.</p><p>But because she had never, in all her years, seen anything like this.</p><p>Not just power. Not just rage. </p><p>Loyalty. </p><p>The last one, crawling, begged in Spanish.</p><p>Rio’s snarl was the only answer.</p><p>When the silence came, it was sudden.</p><p>Blood dripped onto the broken tile. The courtyard stank of death and smoke. Agatha stood in the wreckage, chest heaving, magic still flickering across her hands.</p><p>And Rio—</p><p>Rio stood in the middle of it, drenched in blood, shoulders rising and falling like a storm about to break again. Her shift was torn down one side. Her thigh—Agatha’s gaze caught on it—was gashed. Deep. Still bleeding.</p><p>The sight of it knifed through her.</p><p>She crossed to her at once. </p><p>“Rio—” Her voice caught.</p><p>The girl was shaking, but not from fear. Adrenaline, perhaps. Instinct. Or something deeper. Her eyes were still golden. Her hands—claws now, almost—dripped with gore.<br/>
Agatha reached for her, but didn’t touch. Not yet. She could see how close the wild edge still was. She let her voice soften.</p><p>“You’re hurt. Sit. Let me see.”</p><p>Rio turned, breathing hard— and then her legs gave slightly.</p><p>She caught herself on the edge of a broken archway, but her injured leg dragged behind her. Agatha’s heart twisted.</p><p>“Sit,” she repeated, dropping into a crouch. </p><p>Rio hesitated. She didn’t understand the words—but she understood the tone.</p><p>She sank slowly to the ground. The shift clung to her wounds. Agatha knelt beside her, reaching with blood-slick hands.</p><p>“It’s shallow,” she murmured. “But it’ll scar.”</p><p>She tore part of her own underskirt for bandages and pressed them gently to the wound. Rio winced, her breath hitching—then a low whimper left her throat. Not rage.</p><p>Pain.</p><p>And beneath it, something far more innocent.</p><p>Agatha looked up.</p><p>For a moment—just a moment—the wolf was gone. And in her place was a <em>pup</em>.</p><p>Scared. Hurt. Bleeding in front of someone she’d dared to trust.</p><p>Agatha cupped the back of her neck with one steady hand, pressing her forehead to Rio’s.</p><p>“You saved me,” she whispered.</p><p>The words felt like a confession. Like surrender. </p><p>She hadn’t meant to care. Not like this. She’d thought of Rio as an opportunity. A weapon. A mystery to unlock. </p><p>But now— kneeling in blood, her robes ruined, her hands shaking from adrenaline, and this temrbling, blood-soaked girl tucked against her chest—</p><p>Agatha felt something break open inside her.</p><p>It wasn’t just gratitude. </p><p>It was awe. And fear. And something ancient that had nothing to do with power. </p><p>Rio let out a low, broken sound. Her head tilted, resting against Agatha’s shoulder. Her body was shaking, blood still warm between them.</p><p>Agatha held her there.</p><p>Not as a master.</p><p>Not as a captor.</p><p>But as something closer to equal. Something on the edge of becoming <em>more</em>.</p><p>⸻<br/>
Agatha’s decision was final.</p><p><strong>They would have to leave within the week</strong>.</p><p>The manor had served its purpose—a place to rest, recover, plan. But the scent of blood would linger in the soil, and witch hunters were like dogs. They always returned to the scene.</p><p>Agatha stood before the cracked mirror in the manor’s dressing room, sleeves rolled, hair pinned up, smudges of ash still faint along her jawline. A sea route pulsed on a hovering map behind her, sailing north from the coast, through dangerous ports and suspicious customs.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder.</p><p>Rio sat perched on the edge of a trunk, barefoot, legs spread, shirt loose, collar gleaming like a shackle against her throat. Her injured thigh was bandaged, but healing quickly. Her hair, though partially combed, still clung to her neck in tangled, wet strands.</p><p>She was beautiful.</p><p> Not in the soft, golden way of court women. No—<em>sharp,</em> sun-burnished, all muscle and menace. Broad across the shoulders. Deep in the chest. Square-jawed, high cheekboned. Her eyes were steady, dark, always tracking movement like a predator.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze lingered longer than it should have. </p><p>How had this happened? She had stepped into that ship looking for power. Knowledge. Artefacts. And she had found all of that— yes— but she’s also found <em>her</em>. And the longer Rio stayed close, the harder it was to remember that she was ever supposed to be a tool. A key. A means to an end. </p><p>Agatha tapped her lip, thoughtful.</p><p>“Traveling with a wild girl in chains raises questions,” she murmured.</p><p>She walked closer, heels quiet on the stone.</p><p>“But a companion. A man. Scarred. Silent. Protective.” She cocked her head, narrowing her eyes. “Now <em>that</em> we could sell.”</p><p>Rio blinked at her.</p><p>Agatha smiled slowly.</p><p>“I’m going to dress you.”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>“Like <em>him</em>.”</p><p>There was something mischievous in her voice— not cruelty. Not command. She wasn’t making fun of Rio. She was trying to make her invisible, yes— but with care.</p><p>She moved to the far wardrobe—half-rotted, full of mould and moths—but inside were relics of a colonial past: vests, high-waisted trousers, linen shirts, coats that still smelled of sea salt and tobacco. Left behind by long-dead men.</p><p>They wouldn’t have fit Agatha. But Rio…</p><p>She held up a cream shirt, a little wide in the shoulders, worn soft with age.</p><p>“Yes. This will do.”</p><p>When she returned, she carried a basin of warm water, scissors, and a comb.</p><p>Rio watched her like a bird would a snake—uncertain if this game would end in pain or reward.</p><p>Agatha knelt before her.</p><p>“I need to trim your hair. Just enough.”</p><p>She expected resistance. But Rio sat still, eyes half-lidded, breath quiet.</p><p>Agatha brushed her hair slowly. With every stroke, a snarl came loose. With every snip, the lines of Rio’s face sharpened.</p><p>She gathered the shoulder-length strands into a tie and knotted them at the nape of her neck in a short, clean bun. The kind worn by sailors and soldiers.</p><p>When she leaned back, the transformation startled her.</p><p>Rio looked—<em>striking</em>. </p><p>More angular. More severe. Not feminine, not precisely masculine either. Just <em>strong</em>. Timeless. Like a carving come to life.</p><p>A sculpture made of moonlight and ruin.</p><p>Agatha swallowed.</p><p>How dangerous it was— to want. </p><p>“Now,” she said softly, “let’s get you dressed.”</p><p>Rio stood, towering slightly over her. Agatha held out the linen shirt. Rio slipped it on. Agatha rolled the sleeves past the forearms, adjusted the hem, laced the front loosely to frame the collar.</p><p>Next—trousers. Too long, but cuffed them neatly. Then a waistcoat, dark navy, that hugged her torso like it had been sewn for her.</p><p>Agatha circled once, smoothing the fabric over Rio’s chest, adjusting the shoulders, fingers brushing her collarbone, her ribs.</p><p>Too close.</p><p>And then she looked down— just for a second. </p><p>The trousers fit well. Almost too well</p><p>The fabric pulled slightly between Rio’s thighs, unmistakable now in profile— the solid press of flesh, clearly outlined in linen and shadow. There was no binding, no padding, no illusion. Just Rio. Simply standing. </p><p>Agatha flushed. </p><p>She’d seen her naked before. She had bathed her, had knelt beside her, cloth in hand, touching every part of her with methodical detachment. But this- this was different. </p><p>Clothed, restrained, unassuming… and still <em>undeniably present</em>. </p><p>Agatha stepped back quickly.</p><p>“There,” she said, voice cool. “You look like someone no one would dare question.”</p><p>She meant it. Rio looked <em>dangerous</em> now, but controlled. Like a bodyguard, a sailor, a mercenary. The kind of man other men avoided.</p><p>A predator dressed in civility. </p><p>Agatha walked to the mirror and gestured for Rio to follow.</p><p>When she did, Rio stood beside her, eyes narrowed at her reflection. Her brow furrowed—but not in confusion.</p><p>She recognised herself. Just… differently.</p><p>Agatha watched her from the side.</p><p>“This will make things easier,” she said. “Easier to walk through cities. Easier to get you to Salem. The fewer eyes on us, the better.”</p><p><strong>Easier to keep you close</strong>.</p><p>Rio’s reflection nodded, once.</p><p>Agatha stepped in behind her and adjusted the loose tie around her collar, her fingers brushing the base of her throat, just above the iron band.</p><p>She hated it. The collar. The mark of it. The reminder of chains.</p><p>“I’ll still see you,” she whispered. “Under it all.”</p><p>Rio didn’t move.</p><p>But her eyes softened.</p><p>She reached up—not quickly—and placed one warm hand over Agatha’s wrist. Not grabbing. Just holding it there.</p><p>Gratitude.</p><p>Or perhaps… understanding.</p><p>A flicker of recognition, as though she knew what Agatha was really saying. </p><p>Agatha didn’t pull away.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>
They traveled under clouded moonlight and bone-white stars.</p><p>Rio moved like something half-born of the wild, even in men’s clothes. The linen shirt clung to her damp collarbones. The navy vest molded to her torso like it belonged there. But her movements were still animal. Every time a horse bucked or a stranger stepped too close, she tensed—not out of fear, but out of reflex.</p><p>She didn’t blink often.</p><p>She didn’t rest easily.</p><p>She didn’t speak.</p><p>Agatha found herself watching more than she meant to. Not out of suspicion anymore— but something closer to… curiosity. To longing. </p><p>There was a grace to Rio’s silence. A dignity in her restraint. Even when her shoulders were drawn tight, even when her body vibrated with some instinct she hadn’t yet unlearned, she made no complaint. No demand. </p><p>It humbled Agatha, sometimes. To be looked at with such patience. To be guarded, not claimed. </p><p>By the time they reached the inn tucked into the moss-draped hills, the air smelled of wet stone and pine needles. Rain clung to the trees. The sky hung low, thick with promise.</p><p>Agatha stepped into the lobby like a noblewoman should—calm, quiet, confident. She let her voice cut clean, her gaze sharp. Her kind always had known how to claim a room with presence alone. </p><p>Rio trailed behind her in silence, boots heavy on the wood floor, hat tilted low. The innkeeper took one look at her and said nothing.</p><p>“One bed,” Agatha told him. “No questions.”</p><p>They were given a key and silence.</p><p>Upstairs, the room was small. The hearth burned low. A knitted quilt covered the bed. There was a single window, slightly fogged with the cold.</p><p>Rio entered first.</p><p>She sniffed the air.</p><p>Literally.</p><p>Agatha watched her—how she turned her head just slightly, nostrils flaring, assessing. The walls. The mattress. The corner shadows.</p><p>Like a wolf checking for predators before settling in for the night.</p><p>It should have unnerved her. Once, it would have. But now…</p><p>“You can relax,” Agatha said, quietly amused.</p><p>Rio looked at her. Said nothing. But the tension in her shoulders remained.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer and reached up—slowly—to tug free the tie at the base of Rio’s bun. Her hair fell, still slightly damp, curling around her neck.</p><p>“You’re safe,” she murmured. “No one followed us.”</p><p>She didn’t expect a reply. Instead, she moved to the bed and began unfastening the top layer of her dress. Her fingers were clumsy with exhaustion.</p><p>Rio’s gaze tracked every motion.</p><p>Not lust. Not hunger.</p><p>Just watchfulness. As if Agatha were something breakable.</p><p>Or <em>hers</em>.</p><p>Agatha caught her looking.</p><p>She tilted her head, curious. “You guard like a beast.”</p><p>Still, Rio didn’t answer. But her jaw twitched slightly.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer.</p><p>“I’ll help you undress.”</p><p>Rio stood like a statue—broad, silent, waiting. Agatha’s fingers found the laces of her vest. She undid them slowly. The warmth coming off Rio’s chest made her breath catch.</p><p>The linen beneath was damp with heat. She smelled like sweat, iron, salt. <em>Alive.</em></p><p>And yet, Agatha wasn’t afraid. She wanted to be closer. </p><p>Agatha folded the vest away, knelt, and began untying Rio’s boots.</p><p>As she bent over the second one, she felt Rio’s breath stir her hair. Close. Inhaling.</p><p><em>She’s scenting me</em>, Agatha realised.</p><p>Not quite human.</p><p>Not quite safe.</p><p>And yet—gentle. Controlled.</p><p>Agatha rose. Their eyes met.</p><p>No words. Only understanding. Only this strange, sacred quiet between them.</p><p>“Lie down,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Rio did. Slowly. She stretched across the mattress, taking up too much space. Her injured leg was still stiff. She exhaled through her nose—short, sharp.</p><p>Agatha climbed in beside her.</p><p>The silence wrapped around them.</p><p>The fire crackled low.</p><p>And then, the thunder rolled.</p><p>Rio’s body tensed. Not from fear—but alertness. Her head snapped slightly toward the door.</p><p>“Just the storm,” Agatha said softly, reaching out to touch her wrist. “It won’t come for us.”</p><p>Rio’s muscles stayed tight for a beat—then softened. She turned toward Agatha, brow furrowed. Her nose twitched.</p><p>And then she did something startling.</p><p>She nuzzled her.</p><p>Lightly. Her nose brushed the curve of Agatha’s jaw, then her temple, then her neck. Soft. Not sexual.<em> Familiar</em>.</p><p>Like a wolf with its mate.</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Then—melted.</p><p>She turned and curled into Rio’s chest. Her head rested beneath Rio’s chin. One of Rio’s arms came up—slid around her like a barrier against the world. Strong, immovable. Possessive without pressure.</p><p>Agatha should have resisted. <br/>
She knew better than to let something primal this close. Knew that intimacy with creatures bound by instinct came at a cost. But the truth was— she was tired. Tired of being the one who always kept her spine straight, her wards up, her heart locked in cold iron.</p><p>And Rio…<br/>
Rio had never once asked her for anything. Never once reached out. Not like this. </p><p>There was something devastating in that softness. In the way the girl— this beast— held her without question, without motive. With trust. </p><p>Not demand. </p><p>Not magic. </p><p>Just…trust.</p><p>And if Agatha was honest with herself, she did want it. Not lust, not control. Just to be allowed to lean. Just once. To let go of the constant readiness to be feared, envied, outwitted. </p><p>She let herself be small for a moment.</p><p>Let herself be held.</p><p>Agatha lay still for a long time.</p><p>The storm moved on.</p><p>But Rio didn’t sleep.</p><p>She <em>watched</em>.</p><p>Listened.</p><p>Breathed with her nose in Agatha’s hair, the way wild things breathe when they’re memorising scent.</p><p>Agatha murmured, almost asleep: “You’re still a beast, aren’t you.”</p><p>She felt the low hum of Rio’s chest.</p><p>Not a growl.</p><p>Not quite a purr.</p><p>Just a sound.</p><p>A <em>yes</em>.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The first thing Agatha felt was heat.</p><p>The fire had died down hours ago, but the bed was still warm—too warm. Something solid pressed into her side, heavy as stone, radiating heat through the quilt.</p><p>She blinked groggily, consciousness dragging in like tide over wet sand.</p><p>And then she realised it.</p><p>There was something… <em>hard</em> pressing into her thigh.</p><p>Her eyes snapped open.</p><p>The room was grey with morning, dim light creeping through the edges of the fogged window. She didn’t move, not at first. Just registered the shape of things: her own arm tucked beneath her pillow, the steady thud of Rio’s heartbeat beneath her ear, the impossibly strong arm curled around her ribs like a drawbridge raised for the night.</p><p>And the pressure. That unmistakable pressure.</p><p>Agatha held her breath and—very carefully—tilted her chin down to glance.</p><p><em>Oh</em>.</p><p>Just beneath the blanket, just where Rio’s hips met Agatha’s thigh, the wool had tented slightly. The outline was unmistakable—thick, half-curved, very present. Her trousers had shifted in sleep, and there it was, resting against her, unbothered by the weight of propriety or the consequences of being this near a witch.</p><p>Agatha flushed. Full heat up the neck, to the tips of her ears.</p><p>Gods.</p><p>She shut her eyes and buried her face against Rio’s chest—not from affection this time, but <em>mortification</em>.</p><p>It was natural. Of course it was. Biological. Primal, even. She’d read enough journals and grimoires to know that arousal during sleep was common in lycanthropic bloodlines—stronger still in beasts that dreamed.</p><p><em>But she could feel it</em>. Through two layers of fabric. Hard and smooth and pulsing faintly against her skin like it had thoughts of its own.</p><p>Agatha’s mind—normally sharp as a blade—spiralled in several directions at once.</p><p>She should move. Gods, <em>she had to move</em>. She was a scholar. A strategist. A grown woman with a reputation to maintain. Not some wide-eyed acolyte swooning at the mere <em>shape</em> of a cock under a blanket. She wasn’t… she wasn’t—</p><p>She exhaled slowly through her nose.</p><p>And peeked again.</p><p>It hadn’t gone away.</p><p><em>Of course it hasn’t</em>, she thought viciously. <em>It’s morning. It’s instinct. It has nothing to do with you.</em></p><p>And yet—</p><p>She remembered the bath. The body she had washed with reverent hands. The weight of Rio’s gaze. The way Rio held her in sleep like something worth protecting.</p><p>Agatha made a soft, strangled noise in the back of her throat and carefully, carefully, extracted herself from Rio’s grip.</p><p>It wasn’t easy. Rio was heavy, even relaxed—like trying to slip out from under a carved statue. But Agatha managed it, lifting Rio’s arm inch by inch and sliding away like a thief.</p><p>Once free, she stood too quickly. Her bare feet slapped the cold wood floor. Her breath came faster than it should have.</p><p>She didn’t look back.</p><p>She <em>refused</em> to look back.</p><p>She walked briskly toward the washbasin and splashed her face with water that was too cold and not nearly bracing enough.</p><p><em>Get it together</em>, she told herself, pressing the towel hard against her skin. <em>You’ve bested warlocks and monsters. You outwitted the Salem Seven You did not survive three decades of politics and pain to be undone by morning wood.</em></p><p>And yet.</p><p>She glanced in the mirror.</p><p>Her face was flushed. Hair sleep-mussed. Her mouth, slightly parted, looked far too kissable for someone actively spiralling.</p><p>She pressed her lips together, then turned sharply and began gathering her clothes.</p><p>Behind her, Rio stirred. A shift of breath. The quiet creak of a mattress. The rustle of blankets falling to the side</p><p>Agatha’s heart gave one startled, traitorous beat.</p><p>She turned, finally— slow, reluctant.</p><p>Rio was sitting up now, bare shoulders catching the watery morning light, hair flattened in one place from sleep, eyes still heavy lidded and not quite focused. She didn’t seem to notice— or care about— the faint ridge still pressing against her trousers. If anything, her entire demeanour was unbothered, almost feline in its disregard for propriety.</p><p>Agatha’s throat went dry. She fixed her gaze resolutely on Rio’s collarbone and nowhere lower.</p><p>“Morning,” she said,, crisp as winter frost, though her voice betrayed her with the smallest hitch.</p><p>Rio blinked once, slow, then inclined her head in greeting without a word. Her hand drifted lazily to scratch at the side of her neck, utterly unaware of the flush climbing Agatha’s cheeks.</p><p>Agatha turned back to her laces, fingers fumbling once before finding their rhythm. She buttoned herself to the throat.</p><p>By the time she crossed to the window, the air in the room had cooled slightly, though her pulse had not.</p><p><br/>——-</p><p><br/>The ship was modest—merchant-owned, hired quietly, no questions asked. Agatha had paid well for discretion. She always did. The captain was grizzled, more interested in coin than passengers, and the crew kept to their tasks with that convenient, wilful blindness money could buy.</p><p>Half a day. That was all it would take. </p><p>Just enough time to cross into Massachusetts waters, to slip through the old warded shoreline that surrounded true Salem—the hidden city buried beneath centuries of myth and misdirection, cloaked in enchantments, accessible only to those who knew what lay beneath the veil.</p><p>Agatha stood on the deck, gloved hands gripping the rail, eyes narrowed at the grey horizon. If she kept her eyes forward, she could almost convince herself she wasn’t acutely aware of the woman behind her… and the way her body still remembered the press of her in the dark.</p><p>The sea stretched endlessly before her— metallic and cold, waves lapping like whispered threats. The sky hung low, fat with rain not yet fallen.</p><p>Behind her, she could hear Rio pacing.</p><p>Always pacing. Like a caged thing caught between fight and flight. </p><p>She’d stripped her navy vest, left only in her linen shirt, the collar laced loosely and sleeves rolled. Her boots struck the deck with a soft rhythmic thud— measured, heavy, restless. Every step was tension wound tightt.</p><p>She <em>hated</em> the boat.</p><p>Agatha could feel it— not just see it, but sense it in her blood. The sea unsettled her. The scent of salt and rust. The constant movement beneath her feet, the rolling unease of a world without solid ground. Too many bodies. Too many eyes.</p><p>Too many men.</p><p>Rio’s nostrils flared every few minutes like she couldn’t help it— scanning the air for danger, searching for familiar scents in a world that smelled wrong.</p><p>And beneath it all, that low, nearly-silent rumble. </p><p>Not a growl. But almost. Just beneath the skin.</p><p>Agatha didn’t need magic to know how close to the edge Rio was. </p><p>“Stop pacing,” she murmured, not unkindly.</p><p>She meant it gently, though her voice still carried the weight of habit— of being obeyed.</p><p>Rio halted mid-step, turning toward Agatha with slow, deliberate tension. Her body spoke before her eyes did. The set of her shoulders. The curl of her fingers. She was watching everything. </p><p>Agatha met her gaze calmly. “You’re drawing attention.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flicked sideways. To the crewmen two paces off— the greasy one who had been watching Agatha since they boarded.</p><p>Agatha followed her gaze.</p><p>The man smiled. A thin, lipless thing.</p><p>Rio didn’t growl. But she might as well have. </p><p>Her whole frame tightened, body coiling in on itself like a bow being drawn.</p><p>Agatha stepped in before instinct could take over.</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha said, sharper now. She crossed the deck to her in three measured steps and placed a gloved hand flat to Rio’s chest—right over her sternum, where her heartbeat thundered beneath skin and bone</p><p>She could feel it. The animal tension. The restraint. The potential for violence. </p><p>Her thumb brushed the edge of the collar, where the iron met warm skin.</p><p>Rio’s chest heaved once.</p><p>Her eyes slid closed.</p><p>And slowly— slowly— she leaned, just slightly, into Agatha’s hand.</p><p>Something unclenched in Agatha’s ribcage.</p><p>“It’s not a threat,” she whispered. “Not yet.”</p><p>She knew it could be. That man was a footnote in their story. A breeze against a match. </p><p>But Rio listened. She didn’t move, but Agatha could feel the change— tension bleeding out of her like steam from a closed pot.</p><p>Agatha covered her hand. Let it linger for a moment longer than was necessary. </p><p>“Come,” she said, softer now. “Walk with me.”</p><p>They slipped below deck, where the air was tighter but quieter—a small cabin with a bench bolted to the wall and a porthole letting in silvers of grey and light. </p><p>Agatha sat. </p><p>Rio didn’t. </p><p>She paced again— briefly— then braced herself near the wall, too restless to settle. But her eyes stayed on Agatha now.</p><p>Not the door. Not the shadows. </p><p>Her. </p><p>Agatha tilted her head, the corner of her mouth twitching. </p><p>“You don’t like the sea.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tensed, but she didn’t respond. </p><p>“You’d rather have your paws in the dirt, wouldn’t you?”</p><p>She meant it playfully. But it hit something true. </p><p>Something flickered across Rio’s face. Not a smile. But close. A glint of understanding. </p><p>Agatha reached out, fingers extended.</p><p>She took Rio’s hand.</p><p>The difference now from that first touch— when Rio had flinched like a wounded dog— was startling. </p><p>Now, her hand settled into Agatha’s with the weight of presence. Solid. Grounding. Not needing reassurance. </p><p>Just connection. </p><p>Agatha felt her throat tighten.</p><p>This wasn’t just protection anymore. It wasn’t power, or curiosity, or possession. It was something warm and frighteningly fragile. A bond forming in the quiet between storms.</p><p>The ship rocked gently.</p><p>Rio braced her other hand against the cabin wall, leaning just slightly over her.</p><p>Agatha felt the air shift. </p><p>The height difference. The weight of Rio’s body above her. The faint warmth radiating from her, carrying the scent of rain-soaked pine and salt. It stirred something old in Agatha’s bones— something that whispered of vulnerability, of surrender, of wanting to trust the thing with teeth.</p><p>Her pulse betrayed her. It was too quick. Too loud.</p><p>The gloved hand holding Rio’s tightened slightly, though not enough to break the moment. </p><p>Rio’s gaze roamed her face— slowly, deliberately— as if memorising every line, every flicker of expression. It wasn’t the clinical assessment of a predator. It was something deeper. Hungrier, yes, but not for flesh. For knowing. </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught when Rio’s eyes lingered on her mouth. </p><p>The cabin seemed smaller for it— walls pressing in, air thickening. The only sound was the low creak of the hull and the soft hum in Rio’s throat, the one she made when she was trying to hold still and failing. </p><p>Agatha felt a flicker of temptation— of leaning into that shadow, letting herself be caught. </p><p>But she held her ground. </p><p>Rio’s thumb brushed against her palm. Barely. Just a ghost of a movement. Yet it sent something sharp and molten curling low in Agatha’s chest. </p><p>For the first time since boarding, Rio wasn’t scanning for danger.</p><p>She was watching <em>Agatha</em>.</p><p>And that, more than anything, made Agatha’s breath catch.</p><p>When they docked a few hours later at the veiled port outside Salem, the crew was silent. Even the leering man avoided Rio’s eyes as they disembarked.</p><p>No one asked where they had come from.</p><p>Or who the tall, strange man beside the noblewoman was.</p><p>Agatha kept her chin high as they passed into the fog. But inside, something pulled low and quiet in her chest— something strange and steady. </p><p>She had brought a beast to the gates of Salem.</p><p>And yet, with Rio’s warmth at her back, her quiet strength shadowing every step…</p><p>Agatha had never felt safer.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>From the outside, it looked like nothing—just a patch of fog off the Massachusetts coast, broken only by jagged rocks and a decaying chapel built into the cliffside.</p><p>But Agatha knew where the doors were.</p><p>Not just the physical ones, the ones you could mark on a map— but the ones whispered about in firelight, the ones spoken of in riddles and curses. She had found her way here the first time in desperation. She returned now with something else entirely. </p><p>She led Rio through the mist and into the chapel ruins, the sounds of their boots muffled by wet stone. Past the shattered alter, down a spiralling stair hidden beneath a false slab of limestone. </p><p>Each step carried them deeper— below sea level, through damp air and whispering cold.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught on memory. She had defended these stairs alone once, desperate and ragged, her fingers blooded from clawing at the edges of ever spell she could find. But now…</p><p>Now, Rio moved behind her. Silent. Large. Steady. </p><p>It wasn’t comfort exactly— but it was weight at her back that made her feel less alone. Less mortal. </p><p>Then they reached it.</p><p>The gate.</p><p>A great circular arch of blackened bone and iron, half-swallowed by the stone wall. Its surface pulsed like someone sleeping. Symbols glowed faintly in its frame—runes older than Latin, older than even the covens that claimed this place. Most witches passed with a blood offering.</p><p>Agatha had once bled for this city. She wondered now if it remembered. </p><p>She approached with her hand outstretched.</p><p>The moment her fingers brushed the stone, the runes lit violet and the gate opened with a low, reluctant sigh. Like a breath held too long.</p><p>She stepped forward without hesitation.</p><p>Rio didn’t. </p><p>Her boots scraped against the stone as she stopped dead, shoulders tensed so hard that the muscles in her neck corded. Her eyes were wide— not in fear exactly, but in the wary calculation of something cornered. She tilted her head slightly, nostrils flaring, taking in scents that didn’t belong to the surface world.</p><p>Agatha turned to her. “Its alright.”</p><p>The wolf’s gaze stayed fixed on the dark beyond the gate, as if something inside was calling her name in a voice only she could hear.</p><p>Agatha took a step back toward her, letting her voice soften to something low and certain. “It won’t harm you. Not while I’m with you.”</p><p>Rio’s throat worked, like she was swallowing down a sound.</p><p>Agatha reached up, her gloved fingertips brushing lightly against the side of her jaw— just enough contact to ground her. “It’s only a threshold. Step through, and it will know you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flicked to hers, searching for something— truth, promise, a reason to trust. </p><p>Agatha gave it to her without flinching. “I won’t let it take anything from you.”</p><p>A beat. </p><p>Then Rio moved. Slow. Controlled. Her boot crossed the line between stone and spell.</p><p>They stepped into Salem.</p><p>It wasn’t a city so much as a wound beneath the earth—a place carved into ancient rock and time itself. Flickering lanterns lit with blue flame. The streets sloped at impossible angles, always deeper. Always inward. </p><p>The air smelled like spell-dust, candle wax and cold memory. </p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. No matter how many times she returned, it always felt like a place that had been waiting for her. Watching her. Now it watched them both. </p><p>Rio froze again at the threshold of the first street.</p><p>Her head lifted like a hound catching scent, her nostrils flaring sharply this time.</p><p>Agatha didn’t need to ask. She felt it too— the wards, the weight. The pressure in the air like the walls were holding their breath.</p><p>The lanterns flickered. </p><p>A bell tolled far away— not one rung by hand, but one buried deep in the city’s veins. A summoning. A warning. A recognition. </p><p>The city knew she had brought something inhuman.</p><p>Rio stepped forward, slower now, her movements measured. Her boots hit the old stone street with a solid sound. </p><p>And the symbols in the arch above them glowed. </p><p>Not violet. </p><p>Not gold. </p><p>Green. </p><p>The same green as the collar at Rio’s throat.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>A dozen thoughts collided behind her eyes— runes she’d read, wards she’d cast, stories of the buried, ancient bloodlines kept hidden even from the oldest orders. This wasn’t just a charm to bind the wolf.</p><p>This collar had been hiding something. </p><p>Or someone. </p><p>“Interesting,” she whispered, almost reverently. </p><p>They moved quickly, avoiding the main thoroughfares. Through narrow alleys, forgotten passages, cloaked doors hidden behind illusion. But eyes still found them.</p><p>Witches raised when they saw Rio. Old ones. Street spell casters. Shopkeepers and archivists. </p><p>None of them spoke. </p><p>They bowed their heads. Crossed themselves with warding gestures. Stepped back— not out of disgust, but reverence. Of fear. </p><p>Or both. </p><p>Agatha said nothing until they reached her old refuge— tucked between two ruined towers, a private haven she had carved out when she first clawed her war into the city’s deeper circles. The door creaked open under her hand. </p><p>The room smelled dry. Old. Familiar in the way bone is familiar when it’s your own. </p><p>Rio stepped inside behind her, eyes still scanning, shoulders still high. She didn’t relax. But she didn’t run either.</p><p>Agatha shut the door behind them and leaned back against it, exhaling.</p><p>Her gaze tracked across the room— dusty curtains, warped bookshelves, the hearth still cold— and then to Rio, who had already drifted towards the window. She was still breathing deep, nostrils flared, chest rising in slow, cautious rhythm. </p><p>Agatha crossed the room slowly, the floor groaning beneath her boots.</p><p>“You feel it, don’t you,” she murmured.</p><p>Rio turned to face her. Her eyes were dark, steady. No fear— just awareness. Like she’d stepped into a place that remembered her even if she didn’t remember it. </p><p>Agatha swallowed. </p><p>“This city knows you,” she said, low and steady. “Or… knows what you are.”</p><p>She stepped closer— close enough that she could see the subtle twitch in Rio’s jaw, the faint pulse at her throat. Close enough that the scent of rain and wolf clung to her clothes. Her hands came up of their own accord, cupping Rio’s face, thumbs brushing the sharp edge of her jaw.</p><p>The warmth there startled her. She hadn’t realised until that moment how cold her own hands had gotten.</p><p>Up close, Rio’s eyes were fathomless. Not beast. Not girl. Something else.</p><p>Something older. </p><p>Something that made Agatha’s own magic hum against her skin, a steady, electric thrum that pooled low in her belly.</p><p>“I don’t think the collar is just keeping your wolf bound,” she whispered. “I think it’s hiding you. From them. From us.”</p><p>Rio didn’t move. But deep in her chest, something stirred. </p><p>A rumble. A growl. But not aimed at Agatha. Not hostile. </p><p>A question. A truth trying to wake.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers lingered on her jaw for a heartbeat longer than was necessary, tracing the angle before slipping away.</p><p>“You’re safe here,” she said softly, almost surprising herself with the tenderness in it. “No one gets through that door unless I let them.”</p><p>She felt the tension in Rio’s shoulder’s shift— not gone, but eased, as though a fraction of the weight she carried had been set down.</p><p>Agatha dropped her hands, her skin tingling in their absence. </p><p>“We need to begin tonight,” she said, stepping back into motion. Her voice came out steadier than se felt. “The circle, the blood, the breaking. We’re close. I can feel it.”</p><p>And she could. </p><p>It wasn’t just instinct. It was a pull now, coiled in her belly, whispering the grimoire’s page, vibrating in the bones of the city itself. </p><p>Something had been hidden in Rio. Buried, bound, silenced. </p><p>And Agatha had just brought her home. </p><p>She turned away to gather what she needed— bone chalk, silver blades, the lunar bowl etched in runes she still couldnt fully translate. </p><p>Behind her, Rio crouched in the corner of the room. Low to the ground, muscles coiled. Not afraid. Not hiding. </p><p>Waiting. Watching. Guarding. </p><p>Like a beast waiting for a command</p><p>Or a queen.</p><p>⸻<br/>The scent of rosemary and woodsmoke was already curling through the room.</p><p>Agatha stood at the hearth, sleeves rolled to the elbow, a worn knife rocking through root vegetables with steady rhythm. The stew pot steamed gently beside her, half-filled with water that was already turning rich and golden from the meat and bones she’d added.</p><p>She didn’t say anything.</p><p>She hadn’t needed to.</p><p>The low, rolling sound of Rio’s stomach earlier had been impossible to miss, and even more impossible to ignore.</p><p>So now she moved quietly, methodically. The old rhythm of kitchen work came back easily—slice, toss, stir. A whisper here to keep the heat low, a flick of the wrist to call the oil to the surface. Magic softened the labor, but she still did half by hand. Not because she had to. Because it meant something.</p><p>Behind her, she could hear Rio.</p><p>Moving slowly. Warily.</p><p>The creak of the floorboards as she drifted closer. The quiet drag of her fingertips along the edge of the table, then the windowsill. A low breath. A deeper inhale.</p><p>Sniffing.</p><p>Agatha bit back a smile.</p><p>She tossed a pinch of salt into the pot, then stirred once clockwise. The stew was nearly ready, thick and fragrant, the kind that filled your lungs before it even hit your tongue.</p><p>A faint rustle of movement.</p><p>Then two fingers hovered at the rim of the pot.</p><p>Agatha smacked them away with a practiced flick of the spoon. “Hot,” she said, not unkindly. “And not ready.”</p><p>Rio recoiled with a startled grunt and shook her hand, narrowing her eyes at the pot like it had betrayed her.</p><p>Agatha glanced back. “You’re very brave with hexes and ancient blood magic, but apparently steam is your mortal enemy.”</p><p>Rio huffed and sank onto the rug near the fire, arms crossed over her knees, glaring at the pot with open suspicion.</p><p>Agatha stirred again, letting the silence stretch as the last few ingredients softened. When the broth had turned deep and savoury, she dipped a spoon to taste. Nodded to herself. Then ladled it into two bowls.</p><p>She set one on the battered old table.</p><p>The other, she kept in her hand.</p><p>“Come on,” she said gently, glancing down at the bundled figure near the hearth. “I know you can follow that kind of command.”</p><p>Rio rose slowly, her movements loose and a little predatory, like she wasn’t entirely convinced the table wasn’t part of a trap. But she obeyed.</p><p>She hovered over the bowl first, nose twitching, eyes sharp.</p><p>Then—without hesitation—she reached in with her fingers and plucked out a piece of potato, popping it into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha didn’t even bother to scold her this time.</p><p>She just waited.</p><p>Rio froze halfway through chewing.</p><p>Her lips parted. She fanned her mouth with her hand and gave a dramatic whine.</p><p>Agatha blinked once. “Yes,” she said dryly. “Still hot.”</p><p>Rio swallowed with a wince, and gave her a wounded glare. Agatha snorted softly and took her seat, lifting her own spoon. She blew gently on it before taking a slow, composed bite.</p><p>Rio watched her. Then looked at the spoon beside her bowl.</p><p>She picked it up.</p><p>Backwards.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip. Stayed quiet.</p><p>Rio turned it. Tried again. Dipped it too deep, spilling broth back into the bowl with a splash. She blinked at the mess, confused.</p><p>Agatha delicately sipped from her own spoon. “There’s no shame in learning.”</p><p>Rio frowned in concentration. Dipped again, slower this time.</p><p>Lifted.</p><p>Brought it to her mouth.</p><p>And <em>slurped</em>.</p><p>Loudly.</p><p>Agatha stared.</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>Agatha burst into laughter.</p><p>It came out startled, bubbling— and somewhere in the middle she <em>snorted</em>.  An undignified little sound that only made her laugh harder. She clutched the edge of the table and let it happen, watching as Rio blinked at her again, spoon still mid-air, entirely uncertain if she’d done something wrong or very right.</p><p>“You sound like a cauldron with a chest cold,” Agatha gasped, still laughing.</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes.</p><p>Then, eyes locked with hers—she slurped again.</p><p>Louder.</p><p>Agatha choked on a laugh and had to wipe her eyes with the edge of her sleeve.</p><p>Rio gave a small, pleased grunt and finally settled into her chair properly, continuing to eat. This time quieter, more focused. Still a little awkward, but getting there.</p><p>Agatha composed herself slowly, lifting her spoon again with more grace than she felt.</p><p>“Next lesson,” she said, voice warm, “chewing with your mouth closed.”</p><p>Rio paused. Considered.</p><p>Then took her next bite perfectly.</p><p>Agatha smiled over her bowl, quietly marvelling at the impossible girl sitting across from her.</p><p>And for the first time since stepping into Salem, the city’s weight didn’t feel quite so heavy.</p><p> </p><p>——-</p><p><br/>The bath was nearly full.</p><p>Steam curled into the rafters of the old Salem house, carrying the scent of crushed moonflower, rosemary, and vervain. Agatha stirred the water with one hand, her other lighting each candle around the stone basin with a flick of violet fire.</p><p>Rio sat nearby on a low stool, motionless but alert. Her shirt hung loose from one shoulder. Her hands rested on her knees. Her collar gleamed faintly in the firelight—iron threaded with green runes, pulsing slow and sickly like a heartbeat under thick skin.</p><p>She was quiet, but her muscles were tight.</p><p>She <em>felt</em> what was coming.</p><p>So did Agatha.</p><p>“This is not just a cleansing,” Agatha murmured. Her voice was low, rich with old language. “It’s preparation. The ritual won’t work unless your body accepts the spell. And that body of yours has been bound for too long.”</p><p>She turned toward her. “Stand.”</p><p>Rio did.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, untied the shirt slowly. Her fingers grazed skin as she peeled it off, exposing scarred shoulders, a ribcage marked by both violence and survival. Her chest was almost flat, the faint rise of small breasts barely breaking the line of muscle— a body shaped by strength more than softness. The wound from the witch hunters had healed well—just a pink line now.</p><p>Rio’s breath stayed steady.</p><p>But her eyes followed Agatha’s every movement.</p><p>Agatha let her gaze wander, not shying away. This body before her—so strong, so thoroughly <em>not</em> human—was something crafted by wildness itself. Rio was not a woman pretending to be a man, or a wolf forced to be human.</p><p>She was something other.</p><p>And <em>beautiful</em>.</p><p>“Step in,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Rio obeyed, lowering herself into the bath. The water rippled around her hips, her thighs, her chest. She sat slowly, closing her eyes as the heat enveloped her. The scent of herbs clung to her skin.</p><p>Agatha knelt beside the basin.</p><p>She dipped a cloth into the water, wrung it out, and began to wash her.</p><p>Not roughly. Not tenderly either. It was reverent. Ritualistic.</p><p>She started with Rio’s hands—strong, blunt-nailed, once caked with blood—and worked her way up her arms, her shoulders, the back of her neck.</p><p>When she reached the collar, she paused.</p><p>Her fingers brushed the iron, and it burned. The green runes sparked faintly, resisting.</p><p>Agatha didn’t pull back.</p><p>“You don’t get to hide behind this anymore,” she said softly. “Not after tonight.”</p><p>Rio opened her eyes.</p><p>Agatha held her gaze.</p><p>“There is power in being seen,” she whispered.</p><p>Her hands moved lower now, over the broad planes of Rio’s chest, down her stomach. And when the cloth passed between her thighs, Agatha’s breath caught despite herself. </p><p>Rio inhaled sharply, the sound almost silent but impossible to miss. Her thighs tensed under the water, but she didn’t move away. Her eyes flicked down to where Agatha’s hand worked, then back to her face, holding her there— steady, unflinching. There was no shame in her expression, but there was a shift, subltle and primal, as though some part of her that had been sleeping had just opened its eyes.</p><p>The moment was brief but unavoidably intimate— the heat of the water, the firmness of the muscle under Agatha’s hand, the reminder of the living, breathing body she was tending. She told herself it was the ritual, the necessity of the cleansing, yet warmth still crept up her neck, blooming faintly across her cheeks. </p><p>She did not linger. She did not avert her eyes either. </p><p>Her touch remained steady, respectful, as if the act itself were part prayer, part vow. </p><p>When she was finished, she drew the cloth back, dipped it in the basin and continued without comment— over her thighs, her calves, her feet— until every trace of the outside world was washed away.</p><p>She finished the cleansing in silence, drying Rio with linen and dressing her in a simple dark robe that left her feet bare. The robe had belonged to Agatha once—but it hung differently on Rio. Heavier. Like it <em>belonged</em> to the earth.</p><p>When she was done, she guided Rio to the ritual space—an old stone circle at the back of the house, carved with sigils so old even Agatha didn’t know all their names. The moon hung just above the glass window above them, pale and full.</p><p>Agatha lit the final candle.</p><p>Rio stood at the centre.</p><p>Her bare feet on the stone.</p><p>Her collar thrumming.</p><p>Her eyes—still dark, still alert—never left Agatha.</p><p>“You’re ready,” Agatha said.</p><p>She took one final step closer, rose onto her toes, and pressed her forehead to Rio’s.</p><p>Her voice was barely breath:</p><p>“I see you,” she whispered, before retreating. </p><p>Moonlight flooded the stone circle like spilled milk, soft and cold. The windows above refracted it in slivers, casting thin silver lines across Rio’s shoulders, her cheekbones, the iron collar gleaming like a wound at her throat.</p><p>Agatha stood at the edge of the ritual circle, barefoot, robe belted tightly. Her fingers were already bleeding—three drops into the bowl of moonwater, staining it violet. Her voice, low and clear, cut through the silence as she began the chant.</p><p>The runes lit one by one beneath Rio’s feet.</p><p>She didn’t move.</p><p>She stood tall and still, like a statue carved by something ancient and cruel.</p><p>Agatha moved around her in a slow arc, fingers raised. Her magic spiralled around the circle, purple and silver, drawn from the marrow of the earth and the curve of the moon.</p><p>“The collar is a cage,” she whispered, “but the soul is older than the chain.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes were half-lidded. Not asleep—entranced. Her breathing slowed. Her fingers twitched. Her head tipped slightly.</p><p>Agatha reached the final line of the incantation.</p><p>She stepped into the circle.</p><p>And touched the collar.</p><p>For a moment—just a moment—something<em> gave</em>.</p><p>A spark. A pulse.</p><p>The green runes flared—</p><p>And then <em>bit back</em>.</p><p>The circle screamed.</p><p>A blast of energy knocked Agatha backward. She hit the ground with a cry, sliding across the stone. Her shoulder struck the edge of the makeshift altar hard. Her hand split open against the floor.</p><p>“<em>Ahh—!</em>”</p><p>The circle snapped dark.</p><p>The runes faded.</p><p>The collar remained.</p><p>Agatha lay stunned, breath ragged, the copper taste of blood sharp in her mouth.</p><p>Then she heard it.</p><p>A sound from deep in Rio’s chest. Not a growl. Not a word.</p><p>A howl.</p><p>Raw. Shattering. Full of rage and pain and something too human to be animal—and too animal to be human.</p><p>It echoed through the house, through the city’s bones. Wards trembled. Lanterns flickered.</p><p>Agatha sat up, wincing.</p><p>Rio was no longer standing.</p><p>She was crouched beside her, hands on the floor, shoulders heaving. Her eyes glowed faintly amber. Her mouth was open, breath sharp, chest rising and falling in wild bursts.</p><p>But her eyes—<em>her eyes</em>— were locked on Agatha’s blood. Wide with panic.</p><p>She whimpered. A soft, broken sound— barely there, but full of anguish.</p><p>Her hands hovered like she didn’t know what to touch. Like she was afraid to make it worse. Her nostrils flared. Her lips trembled. She inched forward on her knees, as if pulled by instinct but paralysed by fear.</p><p>Agatha tried to sit up straighter, forcing calm into her voice. “I’m alright,” she rasped. “Its just… the spell rejected me.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze snapped to her hand—still bleeding.</p><p>A second whimper escaped her.</p><p>She crept forward, slow and low to the ground, like approaching a wounded mate. Her fingers touched Agatha’s waist— gentle but tight. Needing to feel the rise of breath. The rhythm of life.</p><p>Her other hand hovered near Agatha’s wounded palm. She made another sound, this one deep in her throat. It wasn’t rage this time. It was grief. Guilt. The kind that doesn’t know how to speak.</p><p>Then she did something Agatha didn’t expect.</p><p>She leaned down. </p><p>And licked the wound.</p><p>Slow. Gentle. Instinctive.</p><p>The warmth of her tongue traced the gash across Agatha’s palm—</p><p>—and the pain vanished.</p><p>Agatha gasped.</p><p>She looked down.</p><p>The skin had closed.</p><p>Not just clotted—<em>healed</em>. Seamless. Smooth. As if she’d never been injured.</p><p>She stared at her hand. Then at Rio.</p><p>Rio pulled back, her chest still shaking. Her expression was unreadable— half shamed, half shocked— but her eyes burned with something raw. Something ancient. </p><p>Agatha touched the now-whole skin. “You healed me.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes dropped. She didn’t understand the words, but she understood the meaning.</p><p>Agatha reached up and cupped her cheek.</p><p>“You’re not just cursed,” she whispered. “You’re <em>blessed</em>.”</p><p>Rio leaned into her palm, trembling—not from fear. From something deeper.</p><p>Recognition. Grief. Hope.</p><p>“I’ll try again,” Agatha said, softly. “We’ll <em>keep</em> trying.”</p><p>But the words trembled in her mouth.</p><p>Because the collar hadn’t just resisted.</p><p>It had recoiled</p><p>And Rio… she had mended what magic broke.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>The candles had nearly burned down.</p><p>The house lay in silence, broken only by the ticking of old wood and the faint flick of embers in the hearth. Magic still shimmered faintly on the stone walls of the ritual chamber, a residue from the failed attempt. The air was heavy. Still crackling.</p><p>Agatha lay stretched on the long velvet settee, her robe loose at the shoulder where the blast had knocked her sideways. Her hand rested over her ribs. The pain was dulled now, her skin whole where Rio had licked the blood away—healed her with a tenderness that lingered in her bones.</p><p>She slept lightly. Not deeply. Not fully. The kind of sleep a witch takes when she doesn’t trust the night to stay quiet.</p><p>But she wasn’t alone.</p><p>Rio hadn’t moved from her post at Agatha’s side.</p><p>She sat curled against the couch like a dog at a doorstep, back pressed to the velvet, knees drawn in. Her head bowed slightly, ears—no, her <em>shoulders</em>—tilted to track every sound. Her breathing was slow but alert.</p><p>She hadn’t slept. Not since the ritual.</p><p>Every few minutes, she lifted her head to check on Agatha. She leaned in close, nose twitching faintly, scenting the air around her—checking for blood, for fear, for illness. Then would relax again. Chin on her knee. Muscles taut.</p><p>A silent sentinel.</p><p>Once, in the dead quiet between candle flickers, something creaked upstairs.</p><p>Rio growled low—not loud enough to wake Agatha, but deep, dangerous. She rose slowly, silent on bare feet, stalked to the door, and stood with her weight shifted to her toes, sniffing, head tilted.</p><p>Her silhouette in the doorway was enormous. Unyielding.</p><p>She stood there for a full minute.</p><p>Then returned.</p><p>She didn’t sit this time.</p><p>She knelt.</p><p>Directly beside Agatha.</p><p>When the witch stirred—a soft sigh, a twitch of her leg—Rio leaned in, brushing her forehead lightly against Agatha’s shoulder. A touch both possessive and aching.</p><p>Agatha woke with a sharp breath.</p><p>She blinked. Saw Rio, shadowed in the candlelight.</p><p>Close.</p><p>So close.</p><p>Her first thought wasn’t of pain or failure.</p><p>It was <em>her</em>.</p><p>The warmth of her. The quiet <strong>fierceness</strong> she wrapped Agatha in. Like Agatha was hers to guard. Hers to die for.</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened.</p><p>“Rio,” she whispered, voice rough.</p><p>Rio lifted her head. Eyes locked on hers. Alert. Awake. Ready to act.</p><p>Agatha touched her hand—just a brush—and Rio immediately responded. She lowered herself again, slowly, placing her forehead lightly on Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>The weight of it sent a shiver through Agatha’s belly.</p><p>She looked down at her.</p><p>Her wolf.</p><p>Her protector.</p><p>Her—what? Her companion? Her creature?</p><p>Or… something else entirely?</p><p>Agatha let her fingers move through Rio’s hair, now short and wild again, the scent of iron and pine still clinging to her skin. She stroked behind her ear and down her neck, letting her eyes wander to the collar.</p><p>Still there.</p><p>Still humming faintly with green, defiant light.</p><p>Agatha’s brows pulled together.</p><p>She hated it.</p><p>Hated the way it sat heavy against Rio’s pulse. Hated what it hid. Hated what it stole from her.</p><p>But she feared it too.</p><p>Because if the collar came off… what would remain?</p><p>Would Rio still curl against her like this?</p><p>Would she still whimper when Agatha gasped?</p><p>Still scent the air and crouch at the door?</p><p>Still kneel beside her with eyes that burned and waited?</p><p>Or would something <em>greater</em> awaken—something that would no longer need her?</p><p>Would Agatha lose this Rio?</p><p>The one who chose her without language?</p><p>The one who watched over her with breathless, aching loyalty?</p><p>She closed her eyes.</p><p>The question burned.</p><p>She whispered it to the silence between them.</p><p>“Who will you become… without it?”</p><p>She wasn’t sure which answer scared her more:</p><p>The thought that Rio might vanish into something unrecognisable—</p><p>Or that <em>this</em> version of her—this soft, loyal, growling thing—was just a side effect of being chained.</p><p>Agatha’s hand cupped the side of her face.</p><p>Rio nuzzled into her palm with a soft, rumbling sigh.</p><p>Agatha whispered, “Don’t leave me… even if you change.”</p><p>Rio didn’t understand the words.</p><p>But she lifted her head, brushed her nose against Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>And stayed.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>The morning came soft and gold.</p><p>Light streamed through the broken panes of the upstairs windows in slanted sheets, catching in the dust like captured breath. The storm had passed. The house had gone still.</p><p>Agatha woke slowly.</p><p>Her body ached faintly. Her shoulder was sore where the collar’s backlash had struck her, but it no longer throbbed. There was no blood. No fire.</p><p>Just warmth.</p><p>Heat, steady and pulsing, against her back.</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>And realised she was no longer alone in the bed.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>She was behind her. Wrapped around her. Not draped casually—not like a lover, or a child—but curled like a creature claiming its mate. Her arm was heavy across Agatha’s waist. Her head tucked behind Agatha’s neck. Her breath was deep, even.</p><p>It was the sound of safe sleep.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move.</p><p>She let her eyes drift shut again, just for a moment.</p><p>Let herself feel the weight of the body against hers.</p><p>Rio was always so tense when awake. All coiled muscle and readiness. But now…</p><p>Now, she was soft. Sleeping, she breathed with her mouth open slightly. Her thumb twitched against Agatha’s stomach in small, unconscious circles. Her knees had tucked close behind Agatha’s thighs. Their feet touched.</p><p>She had fitted herself to Agatha like she’d done it in another life.</p><p>And something in Agatha’s chest broke.</p><p>This wasn’t just instinct.</p><p>This wasn’t protection.</p><p>This was comfort.</p><p>A wolf curled into the den she’d chosen. Not for duty. Not for safety.</p><p>But for her.</p><p>Agatha turned carefully, slow enough not to wake her.</p><p>Rio stirred, barely. Her brow furrowed in sleep. Her arm tightened reflexively, pulling Agatha closer.</p><p>Agatha didn’t resist.</p><p>She let herself be drawn in. Let her eyes linger on the curve of Rio’s mouth, the scar on her jaw, the lashes thick and dark against her cheek.</p><p>The collar still sat at her throat.</p><p>Still pulsing, faintly.</p><p>Still binding.</p><p>Still hiding.</p><p>But underneath it—</p><p>What was she?</p><p>Agatha’s fingers moved gently, almost without thought, to Rio’s cheek.</p><p>She traced it.</p><p>The movement stirred her.</p><p>Rio’s eyes opened—slow, cautious, golden-brown in the morning light.</p><p>They locked onto Agatha’s. Blinking. Alert. But not startled.</p><p>Like she had already known this was where she’d wake.</p><p>Agatha didn’t speak.</p><p>Didn’t need to.</p><p>She leaned forward.</p><p>And pressed her lips to Rio’s.</p><p>It was not demanding.</p><p>Not wild.</p><p>Not even entirely romantic.</p><p>It was a question.</p><p>A soft, deliberate question.</p><p>
<strong>Will you stay like this?</strong>
<br/>
<strong>Will you still be mine?</strong>
<br/>
<strong>Will you still be you—when the collar breaks?</strong>
</p><p>Rio didn’t pull away.</p><p>She didn’t kiss her back, not at first.</p><p>But she made a sound—small, barely audible—a whine, caught deep in her throat.</p><p>And then she pressed forward, barely, just enough that her nose bumped clumsily against Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>Agatha smiled into the stillness between them.</p><p>She whispered, “You don’t have to know what it means.”</p><p>She kissed her again.</p><p>And this time, Rio kissed her back.</p><p>It was awkward at first— hesitant, searching. The pressure was almost too light, as though she feared she might break something if she tried too hard. Her lips didn’t move with practiced rhythm, they simply pressed to Agatha’s like she was learning what kissing was in the moment, from scratch. </p><p>Her nose brushed clumsily against Agatha’s cheek again. She breathed through her mouth, a faint, uneven warmth that trembled over Agatha’s skin. There was no shaping of the kiss, no coaxing tongue, no deliberate tilt of the head— only the pure, unstudied touch of someone who had never done this before.</p><p>And yet— beneath the clumsiness— there was a raw kind of intent. As if she decided, with her whole body, that she would try to return what Agatha had given her. Her hand, unsure of itself, lifted halfway as though to hold Agatha’s face, then faltered and fell back to the bed, curling in the sheets instead.</p><p>Agatha’s chest ached att he innocence of it. The untrained softness. The way Rio leaned in more when Agatha didn’t pull away, as though she’d found a new way to stay close and wanted to keep it. </p><p>When they parted, Rio’s eyes stayed on hers, wide and steady, lips parted as if she could still feel the shape of Agatha’s mouth against her own.</p><p>Yes, Agatha thought, breath catching.<em> Her first kiss</em>.</p><p>And she had given it to her. </p><p> </p>

<p><br/>The path to the deep archives wound like a vein through the marrow of Salem.</p><p>Carved into living stone and sealed with blood-locks older than colonial time, it was a place few witches had the right—or nerve—to enter alone. The walls flickered with soft violet fire, the air humming with silent wards that stirred when touched.</p><p>Agatha passed beneath the final threshold, her boots echoing softly across the bone-tiled floor. She had left Rio upstairs in the sunlit room, still curled half-under the blankets, drowsy and warm. She hadn’t spoken when Agatha slipped out, just blinked sleepily and nosed into the pillow where Agatha had been.</p><p>The image lingered in Agatha’s mind as she descended.</p><p>She needed answers.</p><p>She needed them <em>now</em>.</p><p>At the bottom of the spiral hall, the air cooled.</p><p>And there—where the torches glowed red instead of violet, where the stone grew slick with condensation—stood the Keeper of the Archives.</p><p><strong>Wanda Maximoff</strong>.</p><p>Wanda was tall and quiet, her hair long, unbound, the colour of dried blood. She wore a deep red, tight fitted dress and a matching cloak that pooled around her like spilled wine. But power clung to her like mist.</p><p>And, as always, she seemed to know. Wanda had a way of meeting people already standing in the middle of their secrets, as if the telling was only a formality.</p><p>She was turned away at first, reading a scroll beside a candlelit table.</p><p>But she spoke before Agatha reached her.</p><p>“You’re walking like someone with guilt in their lungs.”</p><p>Agatha stopped.</p><p>“Hello to you, too.”</p><p>Wanda turned slowly. Her eyes—deep and dark, with a strange softness always at the edges—settled on her.</p><p>Agatha did not flinch. But she felt suddenly… young.</p><p>“Don’t tell me you’ve come for old bloodline myths,” Wanda said dryly. “You’ve always hated those.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated.</p><p>Then: “This one… might be different.”</p><p>Wanda tilted her head.</p><p>She moved to a high shelf, running her fingers across a row of grimoires bound in serpent skin and whale bone. “You’re not here about yourself. You’d never come asking for help unless it was for someone else.”</p><p>Agatha stayed silent.</p><p>“Who is it?” Wanda asked softly. “Who’s got you climbing into the past?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated.</p><p>Then said, “She’s wearing a collar I can’t break.”</p><p>Wanda stilled, the faintest flicker crossing her face— confirmation she already had some idea of what Agatha was about to say.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer. Her voice lowered.</p><p>“It glows green. It resists moon rites. It bites back when I touch it with witchcraft.” Her voice caught, just barely. “It’s ancient. It’s <em>not just a curse</em>.”</p><p>Wanda turned.</p><p>Her eyes, dark and thoughtful, flicked over Agatha’s face.</p><p>“You care about her.”</p><p>It wasn’t a question.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p>Wanda studied her for a long moment.</p><p>Then, without a word, she reached for a scroll sealed in white wax.</p><p>“I know what you’re looking for,” she said. “But you won’t like it.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands twitched.</p><p>Wanda broke the seal.</p><p>Unrolled the scroll.</p><p>She read aloud, voice flat and quiet:</p><p>“When the Moon gave birth to her first daughter,<br/>the first witches feared her power.<br/>So they sealed her name, chained her blood,<br/>and called it mercy.<br/>Her collar was not to bind her beast—<br/>but to contain her divinity.<br/>For she would remember who she was only when<br/>someone saw her whole.<br/>Not as a girl. Not as a wolf.<br/>But as <em>the bridge between worlds</em>.”</p><p>The words hung like cold wind.</p><p>Agatha stepped forward, eyes on the text.</p><p>“So she’s not cursed.”</p><p>Wanda looked at her. “She’s <em>asleep</em>.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed.</p><p>“What happens when she wakes?”</p><p>Wanda’s voice was a whisper now.</p><p>“She won’t be <em>just</em> your wolf anymore.”</p><p>That landed like a stone in Agatha’s ribs.</p><p>She looked down at the parchment.</p><p>Felt the weight of the morning—Rio curled around her like a limb, warm and quiet, her lips brushing Agatha’s cheek like a promise she didn’t know how to make.</p><p>“Will I lose her?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Wanda stepped close.</p><p>“You’ll lose the girl in the collar,” she said. “But you may find something greater.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, face unreadable.</p><p>“She growled at a bedpost because I winced getting out of bed,” she said, quietly. “She follows me like I’m hers.”</p><p>“She thinks you are,” Wanda murmured. “That kind of devotion… doesn’t vanish when power wakes. It sharpens.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the scroll a moment longer.</p><p>Then she rolled it up.</p><p>“I’m taking her to the altar in the stone garden,” she said.</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“That place eats witches.”</p><p>Agatha turned, walking back toward the spiral.</p><p>“She’s not a witch,” she said over her shoulder. “She’s something older.”</p><p>And for the first time, Agatha wasn’t afraid of that.</p><p>She was ready.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>The house was quiet when Agatha returned.</p><p>Late afternoon sun slanted through the old windows, painting gold across the wooden floor and pooling in the folds of the sheets where Rio lay—half-curled, half-watching. The robe Agatha had left her in had fallen open at the chest. Her bare legs stretched long across the mattress, tanned skin bathed in fading light. Her eyes found Agatha immediately.</p><p><em>She had waited</em>.</p><p>Agatha closed the door behind her and exhaled.</p><p>Rio sat up, slow and alert. Her eyes flicked over Agatha’s face—scenting tension, reading movement. She was always <em>watching</em>. Agatha was beginning to understand it wasn’t suspicion.</p><p>It was devotion.</p><p>Agatha crossed to her.</p><p>“I know what you are,” she said, softly.</p><p>Rio tilted her head.</p><p>Agatha sat at the edge of the bed, unrolling the scroll. Her fingers trembled slightly—not from fear, but from awe.</p><p>“You’re not cursed. You’re not even just a wolf.”</p><p>She reached out and touched the collar.</p><p>“You’re a god’s daughter. Something sacred. Sleeping. Bound.”</p><p>Rio didn’t flinch at her touch.</p><p>Agatha looked up, voice low.</p><p>“You’ve only known this world with a collar around your throat. Only known people who feared you, who paraded you, who <em>shackled</em> you.”</p><p>She leaned in, forehead brushing Rio’s.</p><p>“I won’t be another jailer.”</p><p>Rio made a soft sound in her throat. Her nose brushed along Agatha’s cheek, slow. Her hands, uncertain but steady, found Agatha’s arms.</p><p>Agatha cupped her face.</p><p>“We have to prepare,” she whispered. “The ritual has to be done at the stone garden altar. It’s wild magic. Pure. It will strip away anything false.”</p><p>She paused.</p><p>“And you have to go into it… <em>willingly</em>”</p><p>For a moment neither moved. The last light of the day caught in Rio’s hair, in the curve of her jaw, and Agatha felt the quiet shift inside her— a recognition she hadn’t wanted to name until now. She was falling in love with her. Not the idea of freeing a rare creature, not with the thrill of ancient magic, but with Rio herself— the way she watched, the way she guarded, the way she existed entirely on her own terms, even in chains.</p><p>Her thumb traced the line of Rio’s cheekbone, slow, reverent. </p><p>“And it isn’t just for you,” she added. “We both have to take part. We both need cleansing—inside and out.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze deepened, unblinking. Her nostrils flared slightly, catching the scent of herbs before Agatha even moved to the basin.</p><p>Agatha rose, crossing to the corner where the basin waited. She filled it with fresh water from the pitcher, the stream splashing against smooth metal. The sound was loud in the hush. She added herbs, crushed the salts between her fingers, watching them dissolve into a faint haze. Steam curled upward, carrying rosemary and moonflower into the air.</p><p>She set the scroll aside and began to untie the laces of her dress.</p><p>Her fingers slowed halfway down, aware—acutely—of the weight of Rio’s gaze.</p><p>The ties slipped loose. Fabric whispered against her skin as it slid from her shoulders. The dress pooled at her feet in a sigh of linen.</p><p>Rio’s entire body stilled. Her head tilted slightly forward, like prey scenting something wild, but her eyes were locked on Agatha, sharp and unyielding. Her breath caught audibly, a lo sound rising in her throat that wavered between a growl and something more human.</p><p>Her gaze did not flicker. It traced Agatha’s collarbone as if it were a constellation. Down the slope of her breasts, the line of her ribs, the curve of her waist. When her eyes reached Agatha’s hips, they lingered—slow, deliberate, unhurried, as if every inch mattered.</p><p>Agatha’s skin prickled under the weight of it. She felt heat gather low in her belly, spreading outward in a slow tide. She had been looked at before, by lovers, by strangers, by those who wanted to possess, but this was different. </p><p>This was being seen. This was being known in a way that felt almost dangerous.</p><p>Her cheeks warmed, but she did not shield herself.</p><p>Rio’s head dipped slightly, eyes fixed on the line of Agatha’s body. She inhaled, slow and deep, as if drawing Agatha’s scent into her lungs.</p><p>Agatha stepped into the basin. Warm water curled around her calves. She dipped the cloth, the motion slow, ritual-bound. She ran it along her arms, across her collarbone, down her throat. Her movements felt unbearably deliberate under Rio’s gaze, each gesture a confession.</p><p>When she drew the cloth over her own stomach and down the line of her thigh, she felt her pulse jump. She told herself it was the ritual. But it was also Rio—the way her gaze followed every movement like it was a vow.</p><p>Agatha’s own breath began to match the rhythm of Rio’s.</p><p>When she finished, she turned toward her.</p><p>Rio hadn’t moved. The low sunlight caught her eyes, and they burned gold-brown, steady and waiting.</p><p>Agatha held out her hand.</p><p>“Come,” she said, her voice softer now, but no less certain. “Let me cleanse you.”</p><p>Rio rose in one smooth motion. She stepped forward, closing the space between them in slow, measured strides, almost circling as she approached— her shoulder brushing past Agatha before she stopped in front of her.</p><p>The robe slid from her shoulders, silent to the floor. </p><p>The air between them shimmered.</p><p>Agatha bathed her again, slow and careful. She cleaned the back of Rio’s neck where the collar met skin. She scrubbed the palms of her hands, the pads of her feet. She pressed her lips to each shoulder blade, then ran saltwater down her spine in a single slow line.</p><p>Rio shivered—not from cold, but from something deeper.</p><p>When it was done, Agatha dressed her in white. Simple. Loose. Sacred.</p><p>The last robe Rio would wear before she became what she truly was.</p><p>Agatha knelt in front of her, fingers wet from the ritual oils, touching the collar again.</p><p>“Tonight,” she whispered, “we break this.”</p><p>Rio looked at her—not fearful, but still.</p><p>And in that silence, Agatha felt the question she hadn’t dared ask since the night before.</p><p>Will you still curl around me when you remember who you are?</p><p>Will you still be mine, when you could be everything?</p><p>Rio stepped forward and placed her forehead against Agatha’s chest.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around her, holding her fiercely. And for a long, quiet moment, they stood like that—witch and wolf, woman and god, heartbeat to heartbeat.</p><p>There were no words.</p><p>Only the hush before the storm.</p><p><br/>⸻</p><p><br/>The forest opened before them like an exhale.</p><p>It had rained sometime in the night. Now the air was clean and wet, heavy with pine and moss and something older—<em>earth-magic</em>, stirred from sleep. Agatha walked ahead with her robes drawn close, boots pressing into softened dirt. Behind her, Rio moved in silence.</p><p>Not stealth.</p><p>Stillness.</p><p>She walked barefoot. The simple white robe clung to her legs, damp at the hem, fluttering gently with her steps. She was half-shadow and half-light as the trees shifted around them.</p><p>And the world watched her.</p><p>Leaves trembled without wind. Birds hushed in the canopy. Agatha could feel the tension in the ground with every footstep they took together. The soil wasn’t resisting them.</p><p>It was listening.</p><p>The deeper they walked, the more the trees leaned. Vines curled downward toward Rio’s shoulders, brushing her skin like offerings. Ferns opened as she passed. A stag—tall, antlered, trembling—stood by a creek and simply stared as they passed.</p><p>It did not run.</p><p>Not from her.</p><p>Agatha glanced back.</p><p>Rio’s eyes were sharp, wide, but calm. Alert. The intensity in her gaze was different now.</p><p><em>Present</em>.</p><p>Not lost in instinct. Not clouded by fear.</p><p>But aware. Watching the forest watch her.</p><p>She didn’t walk like a girl anymore.</p><p>She walked like she knew the forest had her name.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled tightly around the leather strap of her satchel, where the blade and moonwater bowl were kept. The closer they came to the altar, the more the magic began to rise—soft at first, then insistent.</p><p>It made her teeth ache.</p><p>Her skin tingled. Her pulse thudded in her ears.</p><p>She stopped once, half a mile out.</p><p>Rio did too.</p><p>Agatha turned, breath catching. “Are you ready?”</p><p>Rio didn’t nod.</p><p>She stepped forward—slowly—and brushed her fingers down Agatha’s arm. She took her hand.</p><p>Held it.</p><p>Her skin was warm. Solid. Steady.</p><p>Agatha let out a slow breath.</p><p>She looked at her—really looked.</p><p>At the wolf who had growled at shadows.</p><p>At the girl who whimpered at pain.</p><p>At the <em>something</em> who kissed her like she didn’t yet know the word for love, but had already chosen her.</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened.</p><p>“If this changes you,” she said softly, “I won’t stop you.”</p><p>She squeezed her hand.</p><p>“But please… don’t forget me.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened.</p><p>She leaned forward, pressed her nose lightly to Agatha’s cheek in a silent, instinctive gesture.</p><p><em>I remember you</em>.</p><p>Then turned, and walked ahead into the clearing.</p><p>Agatha followed.</p><p>The stone garden was older than Salem. Older than any name Agatha had spoken aloud.</p><p>It was not a garden in the way one might expect, no flowers, no hedges, no sculpted paths. Just moss-covered monoliths in a wide, sunken glade, their surfaces carved with glyphs that moved when no one looked at them directly. The stones pulsed faintly now, stirred by Rio’s approach, as if waking from a long, wary slumber.</p><p>They felt her.</p><p>They knew her.</p><p>Agatha stood at the edge of the glade, breath stilling.</p><p>It was time.</p><p>The grass underfoot was cold and slick with dew. A ring of ancient symbols circled the centre of the clearing—half-submerged, eroded in parts—but the bones of the circle still held.</p><p>Agatha dropped to her knees and began to trace the glyphs with powdered ash and salt, muttering the chant beneath her breath. Her fingers moved quickly, practiced, but her heart beat hard.</p><p>Each mark was precise.</p><p>Each breath counted.</p><p>Behind her, she could hear Rio pacing the stone’s edge. She did not speak, but her breath was louder now. Less steady. Her instincts were climbing.</p><p>Something inside her was waking up.</p><p>Agatha felt it, low in her belly, in the base of her skull.</p><p>When she stood, the circle was complete.</p><p>She turned—and Rio had stilled.</p><p>She stood barefoot on the threshold of the ring, the white robe brushing her calves. Her eyes were amber now, not gold—not yet—but close. Her pupils were wide, pulling in every flicker of movement. She tilted her head.</p><p>Not asking permission.</p><p>Not needing it.</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>Agatha stepped aside and extended her hand.</p><p>“Come.”</p><p>Rio obeyed.</p><p>She crossed the boundary and the circle closed behind her like a lock sliding into place. The air snapped. Wind stirred though no leaves moved.</p><p>Agatha felt the breath leave her lungs.</p><p>Rio moved to the centre of the circle and knelt.</p><p>Not like a priestess.</p><p>Not like a captive.</p><p>Like a creature preparing to change.</p><p>She set her hands flat on the ground. Head bowed. The collar at her throat pulsed with a sickly green glow.</p><p>Agatha’s hand trembled as she reached for the knife at her waist.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>No going back.</p><p>She walked slowly around the edge of the circle, beginning the chant—the same words Wanda had shown her, older than the Moon’s tongue, meant to unseal, not suppress.</p><p>The stones responded.</p><p>One by one, they began to glow—violet, gold, then that same green-white as the collar.</p><p>And Rio—</p><p>Rio was trembling.</p><p>Not from fear. From power.</p><p>Agatha saw her jaw tighten. Her hands dig into the soil. Her spine flexed with tension, her body already beginning to shift—not into a beast, but into something <em>more</em>. The robe clung to her back like it didn’t know which form it belonged to.</p><p>Agatha stopped.</p><p>Stood just outside the circle.</p><p>Her voice broke.</p><p>“Whatever you become… I’ll find you.”</p><p>Rio looked up.</p><p>And this time, there were tears in her eyes.</p><p>Not human. Not wolf.</p><p>Just<em> hers.</em></p><p>Agatha lifted the blade.</p><p>The wind silenced.</p><p>The collar burned.</p><p>The ritual began.</p><p>She raised the blade over the circle.</p><p>Her hand didn’t shake.</p><p>But her heart did.</p><p>Agatha spoke the first invocation aloud.</p><p><em>“She who is not born of blood, but of moonlight,</em><br/><em>who howled before language,</em><br/><em>who slept beneath the collar of gods—</em><br/><em>wake now, and remember your name.</em>”</p><p>The glyphs flared.</p><p>The wind rose.</p><p>The collar screamed.</p><p>It shuddered against Rio’s neck like something alive. The runes spiralled. Green light cracked and flickered. Agatha felt the force of it in her chest, as though her ribs were trying to bend inward.</p><p>She drove the blade into the moonwater bowl.</p><p>The silver hissed.</p><p>Then—everything broke.</p><p><br/>RIO</p><p>Pain.</p><p>But not pain like wounds.<br/>Pain like opening.</p><p>Like her soul tearing at the seams.</p><p>She wanted to bite something. Run. <em>Howl.</em></p><p>Instead, she stayed still.</p><p>Let it burn.</p><p>The collar—her cage—was twisting. Flaring with heat. It bit into her skin, into her <em>bones</em>. Her jaw snapped open in a soundless scream. Her fingers clawed the ground. She wanted to shift. She wanted to run. She wanted Agatha.</p><p><em>Agatha</em>.</p><p>Her name echoed inside Rio’s skull, not in words—but in something deeper. A scent. A warmth. A belonging.</p><p>The collar knew.</p><p>It hissed.</p><p>It struck.</p><p>⸻</p><p>AGATHA</p><p>“<em>Break—</em>” she gasped.</p><p>The wind rose into a shriek.</p><p>The glyphs seared white-hot. She could barely see through the magic now, pulsing and furious. Rio was writhing, but still within the circle. Still fighting <em>with it</em>, not against it.</p><p>Agatha stepped into the edge of the ring.</p><p>Against every rule.</p><p>She dropped to her knees and reached for her.</p><p>Her hand touched Rio’s chest—over her heart.</p><p>“I’m here,” she whispered. “I see you.”</p><p>The collar cracked.</p><p>Once.</p><p>Twice.</p><p>Then—</p><p>
<strong>shattered.</strong>
</p><p>——</p><p>RIO</p><p>The silence after was worse than the screaming.</p><p>Because now, everything rushed in.</p><p>The magic that had been bound. The fragments of memory. The <em>truth</em>.</p><p>The collar fell from her throat like a dead thing.</p><p>She gasped—once, deeply—and then the change overtook her.</p><p>Not into fur. Not into teeth.</p><p>Into <strong>glow.</strong></p><p>Into shape beyond flesh.</p><p>Into something between forms.</p><p>She saw through<em> five senses and ten</em>. She felt the trees bending toward her, the stones kneeling, the moon <em>calling her back</em>.</p><p>But more than anything—</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hands on her face, grounding her. Calling her not away—but <strong>back</strong>.</p><p><em>Back to herself</em>.</p><p>——</p><p>AGATHA</p><p>She was beautiful.</p><p>Not because her form had shifted.</p><p>But because it hadn’t.</p><p>Because <em>Rio remained</em>.</p><p>Even with light pouring from her skin, even with her voice reverberating like wind in stone, even with her eyes turned pale and holy—</p><p>She still looked at Agatha the same way.</p><p>Still reached for her with those same, strong, calloused hands.</p><p>Still trembled like a creature afraid she might be turned away.</p><p>Agatha stood slowly, hand still cradling Rio’s cheek.</p><p>“You’re free,” she whispered.</p><p>And Rio—glowing, divine, whole—wept.</p><p>Not from pain.</p><p>From release.</p><p>The collar lay cracked and blackened in the grass.</p><p>Still warm. Still humming faintly, like a dying thing.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at it.</p><p>She couldn’t.</p><p>All she could see was Rio, swaying in the centre of the broken circle, barefoot, breath shallow, skin glowing with the last wisps of power that hadn’t fully settled. Her robe was half torn, clinging to one shoulder, open at the throat where the collar had once sat.</p><p>That patch of skin was red. Raw.</p><p><em>Alive</em>.</p><p>She looked dazed.</p><p>Beautiful.</p><p>And terrified.</p><p>Agatha rushed forward as Rio stumbled—and caught her.</p><p>Her arms wrapped tightly around her ribs, pulling her close as Rio’s weight slumped against her.</p><p>Not like a goddess.</p><p>Not like a wolf.</p><p>Like a woman on the edge of collapse.</p><p>“Breathe,” Agatha murmured, brushing damp hair from her brow. “Just breathe.”</p><p>Rio’s hands clutched at her—fistfuls of fabric, trembling fingers at Agatha’s waist. Her body trembled like the magic was still trying to push through her skin.</p><p>“Hey—hey,” Agatha whispered. “You’re here. You’re <em>here.</em>”</p><p>She pressed her forehead to Rio’s temple.</p><p>Rio’s legs gave out.</p><p>Agatha sank with her to the moss-covered earth, cradling her gently, guiding her down like someone laying a sword to rest after war.</p><p>Rio curled into her lap. Her breathing was ragged now—not from pain, but from something deeper.</p><p>Grief.</p><p>Relief.</p><p><strong>She was unbound</strong>.</p><p>And she didn’t know who she was without the weight around her throat.</p><p>Agatha stroked her hair.</p><p>“You’re safe.”</p><p>She repeated it, again and again, like a chant.</p><p>“You’re safe. I’ve got you. You’re not alone.”</p><p>Rio whimpered softly. The sound pierced Agatha’s heart.</p><p>She bent low, kissed the top of her head.</p><p>Then her brow.</p><p>Then the line just beneath her eye where a tear had gathered.</p><p>“You don’t have to be whole yet,” Agatha whispered. “You just have to be here.”</p><p>She wasn’t sure which of them she was saying it for.</p><p>They stayed there for what felt like hours.</p><p>The stones had gone silent. The air was still. The world, for once, had stopped watching.</p><p><br/>——————</p><p> </p><p>The glade lay quiet around them, thick with the smell of moss, damp stone, and the faint coppery tang of magic still lingering in the air. </p><p>They hadn’t left the altar.</p><p>Agatha had meant to take her home, to let her rest, but Rio hadn’t moved far— just stepped close, close enough that the heat from her body bled into Agatha’s chilled skin.</p><p>When Agatha turned toward her, she found Rio watching her the way she always did— quiet, unblinking, but now with something else there too. Heat.</p><p>Rio’s gaze drifted down to Agatha’s mouth, then lower, lingering at the loose fall of her robe. Her pupils widened, breath catching just slightly— so slight it might have gone unnoticed by anyone else. Her hand twitched at her side, the barest shift of weight forward, as if her body was already answering a question she hadn’t dared ask aloud.</p><p>Agatha knew that look. She felt it in the space between them, thick and humming, the way magic could be felt before it was ever cast. It wasn’t hunger alone— it was want, coiled tight with hesitation. The restraint of someone who had convinced herself she didn’t have the right to touch was she desired. </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched.</p><p>“You can,” she whispered, the words almost breaking on her exhale. “If you want to.” And she realised she was holding her breath, afraid Rio might still think herself unworthy of this. Of her. </p><p>Rio’s breath came faster, a low hum vibrating in her throat as her hand came to Agatha’s hip, slow, deliberate. She leaned in, pressing their foreheads together like she always did, grounding them both before she closed the distance and kissed her. </p><p>It started slow. Testing. The sound of their lips meeting was soft but unmistakable, accompanied by a shaky inhale from Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. She felt the hesitation in Rio’s mouth, the carefulness. Always careful, as if Agatha was made of glass. A small, involuntary whimper escaped her, and Rio’s breath hitched in response, deepening the kiss.</p><p>Agatha slid her arms up around Rio’s neck, pulling her in until their bodies met. The torn edges of the robe slipped, baring the pale curve of her breasts and the soft slope of her belly. Rio’s gaze dropped just for a moment— awestruck— before her hand rose to cup one breast fully.<br/>The reverence in her touch almost undid her.</p><p>Agatha gasped, the sound breaking into a soft moan. “Thats good. Don’t stop.”<br/>She heard her own voice— horse, more desperate than she intended— and didn’t care.</p><p>Rio’s thumb brushed her nipple, and Agatha’s knees weakened. She let out a shaky laugh that melted into a sigh as she leaned back slightly against the cool stone of the alter, letting Rio follow her down. The cold was sharp against her skin, but Rio’s warmth drowned it out.</p><p>When their hips met, Agatha felt her— the hard hot press of her length between them. She drew in a sharp breath, the realisation sending heat through her. <br/>Gods, she wanted her.</p><p>Rio froze, almost as if she’s startled herself.</p><p>Agatha cupped her face, her thumb brushing along her cheek. “Dont ask,” she said, voice rough, a faint growl beneath the words. “Just have me.” <br/>She wanted Rio to know— this was hers to take.</p><p>The restraint broke.</p><p>Rio kissed her again, harder now, their mouths meeting with a faint, wet sound, her breath hot and uneven as her hands slipped beneath Agatha’s robe, guiding her up onto the edge of the alter. The stone was cold beneath her, but Rio’s body was all heat as she stepped between her knees.</p><p>Agatha parted her thighs wider, a small gasp escaping her as the motion pulled at her muscles.</p><p>Rio’s hand slid down, fingers brushing her first— eliciting a sharp, needy breath from Agatha— stroking her open until she was wet and ready. A faint sound rolled from Rio’s chest, almost a purr, at the feel of her. The deliberate pace made Agatha’s chest ache— it was worship again, and she didn’t know if she could bear it without breaking. Then— slowly, carefully— Rio lined herself up and pushed inside.</p><p>Agatha’s head fell back with a sharp, quiet cry. The stretch, the fullness— gods, it was perfect.</p><p>Rio stilled at first, letting her adjust, forehead still pressed to hers, their breath mingling. Then she began to move— slow thrusts, deep and deliberate, each one drawing a sound from Agatha’s lips she couldnt have silenced if she tried.</p><p>Agatha clung to her, a low hum of pleasure vibrating in her chest, not just for balance, but because she needed her close, needed to feel every breath and heartbeat.</p><p>“You feel—“ Agatha gasped, unable to finish the thought as pleasure stole her voice.</p><p>Rio’s mouth found her throat, kissing there between each thrust. Agatha’s breathing turned ragged, each exhale catching at the peak of motion. Rio moved with a rhythm that felt less like taking and more like worship— like each motion was a vow.</p><p>Agatha’s nails dug into her back. “Look at me.”</p><p>Rio lifted her head, breathing hard. Their eyes locked. </p><p>Agatha saw her there— not wolf, not goddess, but wholly herself.  </p><p>The sight— and the feeling— pushed her over the edge. A sharp cry tore from her lips as pleasure surged white-hot through her as she came around Rio, body arching, voice breaking with each tremor.<br/>She felt the magic of the place move with her release, curling warm and golden through her veins.</p><p>And as her body tightened around her, Rio’s breath caught hard in her throat. A guttural moan escaped her, her rhythm faltering for a moment before she caved in completely— burying herself deep as she came with her, her release trembling through her body in shuddering waves.</p><p>Agatha felt it— hot and deep inside her, each pulse matched to the sound of Rio’s low, broken groan against her cheek. That sound would live in her forever.</p><p>The held each other through it, breath mingling in harsh, uneven pulls, locked together until the last tremor faded.</p><p>Rio stayed inside her, arms wrapping around her, pulling her close as if to anchor herself. Agatha could still feel the faint hum of sound in Rio’s chest— something between a growl and a sigh— as she pressed her face into her neck.</p><p>“You are not what they told you,” she whispered, her voice still thick with breath. “You are not too much. You are exactly right.”<br/>And she meant it with every breath she had left.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught, a faint whine slipping free before she could stop it. She didn’t speak, but Agatha felt the slow tremor run through her, the single tear that slid down onto her cheek.</p><p>They stayed like that— joined, wrapped in the lingering glow of the altar’s magic— until the night air cooled the sweat on their skin, and the only sound was the rhythm of their breathing, steadying together.</p><p><br/>⸻<br/>The walk back was slow. The forest held the pale silver of approaching dawn, each breath of wind stirring the scent of pine and earth. Agatha found herself listening to the rhythm of Rio’s steps beside her— the solid weight of them, the faint creek of the leather satchel, the low exhale every time the path dipped.</p><p>At the edge of the trees, Salem’s lanterns glowed faintly through the mist. Agatha’s home stood at the far end of the lane, its dark windows waiting. </p><p>Inside, the warmth of the hearth wrapped around them. Agatha let her robe fall across the back of a chair, the heat from the fire kissing her bare arms. Rio lingered by the door, scanning the shadows like she expected the night to follow them in.</p><p>Agatha held out her hand.<br/>Rio took it without hesitation.</p><p>They climbed the stairs together, the house quiet except for the creak of the old boards beneath their feet.<br/>In Agatha’s bedroom, the bed waited— soft linen, deep blankets, the scent of cedar in the sheets.</p><p>Agatha slipped beneath them first, the ache in her body sweet and grounding. Rio joined her a moment later, moving carefully, like she didn’t want to disturb anything. She curled in behind her, arm heavy across her middle, her breath warm at the back of her neck. </p><p>Agatha’s last thought before sleep was of the altar’s golden magic still humming faintly in her veins— and the quiet promise in the way Rio’s arm tightened around her. </p><p>——</p><p>Morning broke gently.</p><p>Soft golden light spilled across the sheets, warming the worn wood of the windowsill and turning the pale linen of the bedding into a river of gold. The birds outside called in cautious tones, like even they could sense something sacred had happened in the dark.</p><p>Agatha stirred slowly, the ache in her body a pleasant, pulsing thing. She blinked up at the ceiling, unsure of the hour, and felt the quiet thrum of presence beside her.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>.</p><p>Still here.</p><p>Still warm.</p><p>Still curled against her, one arm heavy across her middle, one leg tangled with Agatha’s beneath the blankets. Her breath was slow, but not asleep.</p><p>Watching.</p><p>Always watching.</p><p>Agatha turned her head.</p><p>Rio’s eyes met hers instantly.</p><p>They looked different in daylight. Still dark, still sharp—but softened now. Touched by something human that hadn’t been there before. She didn’t flinch from the gaze. She didn’t look away.</p><p>Agatha reached up, brushing a knuckle along her cheekbone.</p><p>Rio leaned into it.</p><p>Agatha smiled softly. “Good morning.”</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>Then—her mouth parted.</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>For a moment, nothing.</p><p>Then a small, rough sound slipped out—like a breath caught behind too many years of silence. Rio frowned. Her brows knit. She tried again.</p><p>Her voice—when it came—was hoarse, deep, raw from disuse.</p><p>“…mor…” she rasped. “Morn…”</p><p>Agatha’s heart stopped.</p><p>She sat up halfway, hand cupping Rio’s jaw. “Say it again.”</p><p>Rio hesitated. She licked her lips, tried to find the shape again.</p><p>“…morn… ing…”</p><p>Agatha choked on a laugh. Then a breath.</p><p>Then tears.</p><p>She pulled Rio into her arms, laughing softly into her shoulder. “You clever thing,” she whispered. “You remembered that.”</p><p>Rio didn’t quite smile.</p><p>But she looked proud. Shy, almost.</p><p>Agatha pulled back, resting her forehead to Rio’s once more.</p><p>“You’re going to speak again,” she whispered. “You’ll have words. Your own.”</p><p>Rio pressed her palm to Agatha’s chest.</p><p>Then whispered, barely audible—</p><p>“…mine.”</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>The word sank into her like fire.</p><p>Not a question.</p><p>Not a plea.</p><p>A claim.</p><p>Agatha reached for her hand, kissed the inside of her wrist, and whispered back:</p><p>“Yes.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Salem had always known how to hush when magic changed.</p><p>The morning air was sharper than usual, the light too bright for late summer. Leaves shifted on trees that hadn’t moved in years. Familiar wards flickered, strained and buzzing, like nerves under skin. Somewhere in the northern woods, three coven-bonded crows had fallen dead from the sky mid-flight.</p><p>Something had woken.</p><p>And it had walked on two legs.</p><p>In the inner sanctum of the witch council’s hall, deep beneath the polished stone of the gathering circle, a fire was already burning.</p><p>At its edge sat Wanda Maximoff, keeper of the archives.</p><p>She was barefoot, her red shawl drawn tight across her shoulders, her fingers curled around a porcelain cup of bitter tea she hadn’t touched.</p><p>Across from her stood three council witches.</p><p>Older. Robed. Stiff.</p><p>And afraid.</p><p>“She broke the stone garden,” hissed the eldest—Mora, her mouth pinched, her hands veined and ringed with old sigils. “You saw the pulse. Felt the ward tremble. No witch does that and walks away untouched.”</p><p>“She’s not <em>just</em> a witch,” Wanda said calmly.</p><p>“Exactly,” snapped the youngest. “She’s made pact with something. You of all people know the signs. She—Agatha Harkness—was seen weeks ago tracking Esmarelda’s trail. That line of gypsy blood is dangerous.”</p><p>The middle witch, who had been silent until now, spoke up, her voice brittle. “And she has defied us before. Too many times. The market fire, the sandstorm in the East Dunes, the ward breach at Lowmore— every time we’ve tried to discipline her, she’s slipped though our fingers.”</p><p>“She’s clever,” Mora muttered. “Too clever. She stands just outside the law we write. And she smiles when we warn her. You think thats a woman we can trust to bring that thing into our world?”</p><p>“She was not <em>possessed</em>,” Wanda replied evenly. “She did not lose control. She <em>guided</em> it.”</p><p>“It?” Mora leaned forward, eyes glinting. “The girl. The thing. The wolf. Whatever she is.”</p><p>Wanda’s silence was telling.</p><p>The flames shifted. Sparks hissed.</p><p>“She’s moon-born,” Wanda said finally. “Chained by the old green magic. Collared to sleep. And someone finally asked her name.”</p><p>A beat of silence followed.</p><p>And then—anger.</p><p>Disbelief.</p><p>“Impossible.”</p><p>“Godlings don’t <em>survive</em> the old bindings—”</p><p>“She would have burned out by the first century—”</p><p>“Unless,” Wanda said, voice like still water, “someone kept her half-awake. Just aware enough to suffer.”</p><p>The fire cracked.</p><p>“And now she’s not,” Wanda finished.</p><p>No one spoke.</p><p>Not for a long time.</p><p>Then Mora whispered, “We should send a binding party. Before others feel her wake. Before the Crag—before the old things come crawling again.”</p><p>Wanda stood.</p><p>Her cup hit the stone floor with a sharp crack.</p><p>“She is not an enemy,” she said, voice sharp.</p><p>“And Agatha—whatever you think of her—is not a fool. She knows the stakes. She knows what it means to wake something like this. She could have taken the power for herself. She didn’t.”</p><p>The younger witch shifted. “You think she <em>cares for it</em>?”</p><p>Wanda didn’t blink.</p><p>“I think,” she said, “she’s afraid she does.”</p><p>Another long silence.</p><p>Then Mora, quieter now, turned back to the fire.</p><p>“Then let us pray that love is strong enough to hold it. Or we’ll have to burn them both —before the city’s walls are trampled down.”</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>It began with the river.</p><p>The Veil-stream, long quiet and glassy, began to churn at its banks—dark water swirling in lazy spirals, whispering in dead languages no one living spoke. The stones beneath its bed pulsed green, then violet, then gold.</p><p>The fish stopped swimming.</p><p>And the <em>water listened</em>.</p><p>Further east, in the wild places past the wards, roots began to push through old soil.</p><p>Thick. Black. Fast.</p><p>Crawling over ruins left untouched for centuries. Cracking through old circles of salt, rising like hands from under the earth. Moss bloomed in patches, erratic and fast-growing. Trees leaned toward a direction they did not choose.</p><p>Something was returning.</p><p>Deep beneath the Linwood Crag, where the earth split into jagged cliffs and the fog never lifted, the Feral Court stirred.</p><p>Eyes opened.</p><p>Not human. Not even fully <em>beast</em>.</p><p>Some eyes blinked in clusters, glittering wetly like fungus after rain.</p><p>Some didn’t blink at all, fixed and glassy, their hunger ancient and without shape. </p><p>And among them, the lycans woke. </p><p>Their bodied were caught halfway between man and wold, the shapes fluid, shifting with each breath— shoulders bulking, spines stretching, jaws cracking as if remembering the bite. Some crouched low, nails biting into stone. Others paces restlessly, fur bristling, ears twitching toward the distant pull that hummed in their blood.</p><p>In the dark, low among the roots of the crag where the sleeping gods were said to have fallen—weeping, mad, or both—a <strong>call</strong> was felt.</p><p>A howl that had no sound.</p><p>But all of them heard it.</p><p>It burned in their marrow.<br/>It told them of prey.</p><p>In the hollow belly of the crag, a creature stepped forward from the shadows.</p><p>It wore the shape of a man. Roughly. Skin grey-blue, stretched too thin, mouth too wide, teeth hooked like fishbones. Its eyes were pupil-less and gleaming, reflecting things that weren’t there. It moved like something remembering how bones worked, but not caring to get it right.</p><p>It pressed one clawed hand to the ground. The nails were black and curved, each carved with symbols no human tongue could name.</p><p>“She’s woken,” it rasped.</p><p>Behind it, more creatures moved. Some on four limbs, jointed wrong. Some on six, skittering sideways like crabs. One with wings that had never learned to fold, their edges fraying into smoke. Another dragged a tail of vertebrae, each bone carved with prayers for a god long dead.</p><p>“Not a witch,” said another voice. A crawling thing with eyes along its ribs, its jaw opening in three places at once.</p><p>“A daughter,” whispered the wind. “The Moon’s blood.”</p><p>“She broke the collar.”</p><p>“And the witch—”</p><p>“—helped her.”</p><p>The first creature smiled, slow, each tooth a different size, some still dripping with old marrow.</p><p>“Then we must go.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“To kneel.”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>Then another voice, slicker. Meaner. It spoke from the darkness where no shape could be seen, only the stench of rot and the sound off flesh shifting wetly against itself.</p><p>“No,” it hissed. “To kill. While she’s still new. Still not whole. Before the wolf in her remembers her teeth.”</p><p>The lycans’ ears twitched at that, and some bared their teeth— not in anger, but in anticipation. </p><p>Others murmured— low, guttural, hungry— remembering the old stories of Moomblood children. Of what they could do if allowed to grow. Of what they could burn.</p><p>The wind screamed through the crag, a sound like glass being ground underfoot.</p><p>And then silence.</p><p>Then movement.</p><p>The <strong>hunt had begun</strong>.</p><p>⸻</p><p> </p><p>The morning sun warmed the wooden floorboards of the cottage.</p><p>A kettle whistled faintly over the fire. Bread crackled in a cast iron pan, charred slightly at the edges. The smell of rosemary and smoke drifted lazily through the small kitchen, curling beneath the wooden beams.</p><p>Agatha moved through the room in her robe, hair still damp from a basin wash, humming under her breath as she stirred something thick in a bowl. Honey. Butter. A pinch of ground moonroot.</p><p>Behind her, barefoot and shirtless, Rio crouched near the hearth.</p><p>Not <em>sat</em>—crouched, like a hunting animal who hadn’t yet figured out the point of chairs.</p><p>She was holding something between her teeth.</p><p>Something very much <em>not food</em>.</p><p>Agatha turned with the bowl in her hands, looked up—</p><p>—and froze.</p><p>Rio blinked at her.</p><p>Then grinned.</p><p>Or at least attempted a grin, but with a river stone clamped between her teeth, it came off more like a smug dog with a prize.</p><p>“Is that—” Agatha blinked. “Is that the stone from the garden path?”</p><p>Rio made a pleased noise in her throat. Raised her eyebrows.</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Did you <em>eat</em> one already?”</p><p>Rio spit it out into her palm with a loud clink, then held it up proudly.</p><p>Agatha pressed a hand to her mouth, trying—and failing—not to laugh.</p><p>“Oh gods. You really—”</p><p>Rio grinned again.</p><p>Then, proudly: “Bread?”</p><p>Agatha choked on her own amusement. “That is <em>not</em> bread.”</p><p>Rio stood, confused now. She pointed at the hearth. “Hot. Round. Bread.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said through a laugh, crossing to her. “That’s a rock, you feral beast. The bread is in the pan.”</p><p>Rio glanced down at the pan. Back at the rock. Then squinted. “Fire bread?”</p><p>Agatha set the bowl down and leaned on the table, wiping a tear from her eye. “You just invented fire bread. Saints preserve me.”</p><p>Rio looked mildly offended. She bit the corner of a real piece of toast from the pan and gave Agatha a look like <em>this tastes worse than the rock</em>.</p><p>Agatha doubled over in laughter.</p><p>“You’re impossible.”</p><p>Rio moved closer, toast in one hand, river stone in the other. She gently placed both on the table like offerings, then stepped into Agatha’s space and nuzzled into her neck.</p><p>Agatha straightened, surprised—and then softened instantly.</p><p>Rio’s arms wrapped around her waist. Her breath was warm on Agatha’s skin.</p><p>Agatha smiled and let her hands slide around Rio’s back. “You’re lucky you’re charming.”</p><p>Rio hummed, then murmured, voice slow and deep:</p><p>“…mine.”</p><p>Agatha stilled for just a heartbeat.</p><p>Then pressed a kiss to her temple and whispered:</p><p>“Yes. Yours. Even if you eat my garden.”</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>The knock on the door was gentle—but it made Agatha freeze mid-pour.</p><p>She stood in the kitchen, one hand holding a kettle of warmed spiced milk, the other braced on the edge of the table. Behind her, Rio sat cross-legged on the floor, chewing thoughtfully on a sprig of rosemary like it was a victory prize.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked toward the door.</p><p>She didn’t need a ward to know who it was.</p><p>The rhythm was unmistakable.</p><p>Three soft taps.</p><p>A pause.</p><p>Then two more.</p><p>Like a heartbeat slowed down.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Wanda.”</p><p>Rio looked up sharply. Her body tensed—not afraid, but alert.</p><p>Agatha set the kettle down and moved to the door. She didn’t open it immediately. Her hand hovered on the latch.</p><p>“She’s not a threat,” she said softly over her shoulder. “She’s… complicated.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head.</p><p>Not understanding the words, but understanding Agatha’s voice. The softness. The caution. The residual care.</p><p>Agatha opened the door.</p><p>Wanda stood there in a crimson cloak, the edges damp with dew, hair wild from wind and travel. Her eyes were already on Agatha—sharp, searching.</p><p>But the moment she saw past her shoulder—</p><p>Saw Rio sitting barefoot on the floor, covered in sunlight and chewing greenery like a pup in the garden—</p><p>She stopped.</p><p>Her mouth parted.</p><p>She had come with fire. With warning. With the words <em>binding circle</em> and <em>containment</em>, if necessary.</p><p>But she said none of them.</p><p>She stepped inside slowly.</p><p>The door shut behind her.</p><p>Agatha moved to the table, deliberately placing herself between them. Protective. Instinctive.</p><p>Rio watched Wanda with narrowed eyes, the rosemary now clutched in her hand like a weapon.</p><p>Wanda raised both hands. “I come in peace.”</p><p>Rio didn’t blink.</p><p>Agatha smirked. “She doesn’t know what that means.”</p><p>“She knows your body,” Wanda said softly. “She listens to it more than your words.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated.</p><p>Wanda’s eyes returned to Rio. Studying. Not dissecting—reading.</p><p>“She’s changed,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>“She’s still changing.”</p><p>Wanda took a slow step forward. Then another. She crouched—not too close—and looked directly at Rio.</p><p>“You know who you are,” she said quietly. “Even if no one’s given you the language yet.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. Her eyes narrowed slightly. She didn’t growl—but her fingers pressed into the floor like claws readying for spring.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, hand resting lightly on Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“She’s mine,” she said.</p><p>Wanda looked up.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>They stared at each other for a long beat.</p><p>And Wanda’s eyes— still on Agatha— softened in a way she didn’t expect. “The Council… they’re restless,” she said quietly. “They’ve read the omens, and they see only danger. To the wards. To Salem itself.”<br/>Agatha’s mouth tightened. “They see what they want to see.”</p><p>“They see power they cant leash,” Wanda corrected, voice low. “Some will want to bend the knee. Some will want her gone. And they’ll dress either choice up as duty.” She glanced back at Rio, something like awe and worry tangling in her expressing. “Ive seen what she carries in her bones, Agatha. If she grows into it— there will be no undoing it.”</p><p>A breath passed between them— heavy, unspoken.</p><p>Agatha shifted, placing herself just slightly more in front of Rio.</p><p>Wanda’s gaze lingered on her, the ghost of a smile curving at the corner of her mouth. “You’d burn for her without hesitation, wouldn’t you?”</p><p>“I’d burn the whole damn forest,” Agatha said evenly.</p><p>For a moment, the air between them felt like the echo of an old friendship— frayed but not broken— tinged with the grief of knowing they’d never stand on the same side of the line again. </p><p>Wanda straightened.</p><p>“I came to warn you,” she said. “The outer wards are groaning. The earth is opening. Creatures that haven’t crawled out of the Crag in three generations are moving.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression darkened. “Because of the collar?”</p><p>“Because it broke. Because she <em>woke</em>. And because others can feel it.”</p><p>Wanda stepped to the window, her voice lower now.</p><p>“They will either kneel to her. Or try to kill her before she remembers what she is.”</p><p>A silence settled.</p><p>Rio had gone still.</p><p>But her gaze remained on Agatha.</p><p>Agatha felt that gaze like a cord pulling through her ribs.</p><p>Wanda turned back to them.</p><p>Then, quietly: “You’ve already made your choice, haven’t you?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look away.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Wanda nodded slowly. “Then I’ll help you keep her.”</p><p>Another silence.</p><p>Then Rio stood, stepping forward—not threatening, but firm. She reached for Agatha’s hand and held it.</p><p>Wanda smiled faintly.</p><p>“You picked a fierce one.”</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio, fingers tightening around hers.</p><p>“I didn’t pick her,” she said softly. “She picked me.”</p><p>Wanda studied them for a moment longer, then leaned back against the table, crossing her arms. </p><p>“You cant keep her locked away forever,” she said. “The longer she stays hidden, the more stories grow. People fear what they dont see. Take her out into the village— let them look her in the eye. Let them see she’s not a threat.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows knit. “And what if they react badly? If someone decides to test that theory?”</p><p>“They won’t,” Wanda replied. Her tone was steady, certain. “They’ll see what I see. That she’s dangerous only to those who would harm her… or you.”</p><p>Agatha glanced up at Rio, who was still watching her with unblinking trust.</p><p>And in that quiet, Agatha wondered if she was brave enough to test it.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>The Salem market was noisy.</p><p>Not chaotically so—but enough to make Rio’s ears twitch beneath the cropped, tied-back bun Agatha had given her. She walked close to Agatha’s side, eyes darting from stall to stall, bare feet silent on the dusty cobblestones.</p><p>Her shirt was loose. Men’s. Stolen from the manor’s cellar and cleaned. Her trousers hung low on her hips, cinched with a fraying leather belt. Agatha had rolled the sleeves twice, exposing strong, scar-scattered forearms.</p><p>She looked like a quiet farmhand. A little wild. A little strange.</p><p>But <strong>not inhuman</strong>.</p><p>Not at first glance.</p><p>Though here and there, glances lingered. A woman arranging apples paused to watch Rio’s measured gait, eyes narrowing as if she were weighing something unspoken. Two boys leaned against a barrel, whispering behind their palms— “thats her… the wolf the Harkness witch brought home.” An old man muttered to his wife without bothering to lower his voice. “Better keep the little ones close.”</p><p>Agatha, passing close enough to catch his eyes, smiled pleasantly and said, “Yes, you’d better, wolves can smell fear, after all.”</p><p>The man’s mouth opened, then shut again. His wife gave a sharp laugh. </p><p>Agatha carried the basket. She did the talking. She paid in coin and polite smiles, steering them carefully from vendor to vendor while Rio prowled just behind her—shoulders squared, eyes everywhere.</p><p>Until a<strong> scream</strong> cracked the air.</p><p>A child.</p><p>Sharp. Immediate.</p><p>The sound lit something in Rio’s bones before thought could catch up.</p><p>She moved.</p><p>Faster than most eyes could follow.</p><p>Across the market square, a cart had broken loose—a heavy wooden frame stacked high with crates of potatoes and wine barrels. The ox pulling it had spooked, bolting sideways. A small child—no more than five—had wandered into the road, chasing a fallen apple.</p><p>The cart bore down fast.</p><p>Too fast.</p><p>Someone shouted. Another woman screamed. A dog barked wildly, yanking against its tether.</p><p>Rio’s body became nothing but momentum— bare feet kicking up dust, muscles coiling like a bowstring.</p><p>She launched herself across the space, cutting through the panicked throng like water around stone.</p><p>The child turned, wide-eyed, too late to move.</p><p>Rio dove, twisting midair.</p><p>Her arms wrapped around the child, curling protectively, and she rolled—once, twice— her own shoulder slamming hard into the dirt to take the brunt of the impact. The cart thundered past so close she could feel the wind of it, wheels missing her heels by inches.</p><p>A barrel burst free, smashing open in a spray of red wine that bled across the cobblestones. Crates tumbled and splintered. The cart careened into a post with a teeth-rattling crack.</p><p>Dust.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then a single soft cry: the child, wailing in Rio’s arms.</p><p>She knelt in the dirt, clutching her to her chest. Her hair had come loose. Her shirt torn at the shoulder. A  small scrape bled down her temple, but she didn’t seem to notice.</p><p>She just rocked slightly, pressing her nose to the girl’s hair, murmuring low sounds in her throat—half-whine, half-song. <em>Comforting</em>.</p><p>She didn’t look up.</p><p>Not even when the villagers rushed in.</p><p>Gasps.</p><p>“Did you see—”</p><p>“She moved like—like a beast—”</p><p>“That was the Harkness girl, the strange one—”</p><p>Agatha elbowed her way through the crowd, breath caught in her chest.</p><p>She found Rio kneeling, dirt streaked down her cheek, cradling the child who now sobbed softly against her chest.</p><p>And for a moment— just a breath— Agatha forgot the market, the gawking villagers, the looming risk of fear turning to malice. All she could see was the way rio’s body curled around the little girl as if she’d been born for this; to shelter, to shield, to put her own flesh between danger and the small and helpless. </p><p>It was instinct, yes, but there was no sharpness in it now. No snarl, no bared teeth. Only a fierce, aching gentleness. The pads of her fingers stroking tiny curls of hair, the low animal hum that trembled in her throat, the way her own scraped shoulder seemed to vanish from her mind in the face of the child’s distress.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted, not with fear, but with something far more dangerous— pride. And love. The kind that rooted deep and grew thorns around it. </p><p>She thought of the muttered warnings they’d passed on the way here, the suspicion in the eyes of strangers. She wanted to drag them all here, make them kneel in the dust, make <em>look</em>— really <em>look</em>— at this creature they called dangerous. </p><p>Her creature.</p><p>Her wolf.</p><p>Her heart. </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Rio looked up—eyes sharp, wild, unsure.</p><p>Afraid she’d done something wrong.</p><p>But Agatha knelt beside her and reached for her face, cupping her jaw with trembling fingers.</p><p>“You saved her.”</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>She looked back down at the girl.</p><p>Then—slowly, gently—handed her to her mother, who had just stumbled forward in tears.</p><p>The woman took her in shaking arms. Her eyes locked with Rio’s.</p><p>“Thank you,” she said, voice breaking. “Gods… thank you.”</p><p>Rio flinched.</p><p>Then nodded. Once. Awkward. Almost confused.</p><p>Behind them, murmurs shifted.</p><p>“She saved the girl—”</p><p>“Faster than I’ve ever seen—”</p><p>“She threw herself under the cart—”</p><p>“She’s not dangerous, she’s—”</p><p>“A protector.”</p><p>From the back of the crown, someone muttered more darkly, “Protector or predator— it’s only a thin line.” But the words were swallowed by the swell of grateful voices.</p><p>Agatha stood beside her.</p><p>And slowly, carefully, reached for her hand.</p><p>Rio took it.</p><p>Her grip was warm. Steady. Still shaking.</p><p>Agatha turned to the gathering crowd and lifted her chin.</p><p>“She is under my protection,” she said, voice clear. “And she has never harmed anyone.”</p><p>A beat of quiet.</p><p>Then someone—an old man—stepped forward and placed a hand over his heart.</p><p>“To the wold-girl,” he said softly, “may the gods keep her wild… and keep her with us.”</p><p>Rio’s ears twitched.</p><p>Agatha turned to her.</p><p>And for the first time in public—</p><p>smiled.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>The door closed behind them with a soft click.</p><p>Rio stood just inside the threshold of the cottage, stock-still, unsure what to do with her hands. Her shirt clung to one shoulder, streaked with dust and sweat, and the scrape across her temple had darkened to a dull crust of dried blood.</p><p>Agatha set the basket down on the counter.</p><p>Neither spoke.</p><p>The market had been a blur—hands grabbing, voices crying out, the child’s mother weeping against Rio’s chest. Gratitude. Awe. That strange murmur of <em>acceptance</em>.</p><p>Rio hadn’t known where to look. So she’d looked at Agatha.</p><p>And Agatha had looked back at her like she was the sun.</p><p>Now, in the stillness of their little kitchen, Rio shifted her weight, glanced toward the floor, then to Agatha again—eyes sharp, uncertain.</p><p>Agatha moved slowly.</p><p>Not toward her. Past her.</p><p>She pulled a small basin from the shelf, filled it with warm water, then returned to stand in front of her.</p><p>“Sit,” she said gently.</p><p>Rio hesitated.</p><p>Then obeyed.</p><p>She sat on the edge of the table bench, hands resting awkwardly on her knees, watching as Agatha knelt before her and dipped a soft cloth into the water.</p><p>The room was quiet. Only the sound of the cloth dripping. The fire crackling low. The wind beyond the window brushing against the glass.</p><p>Agatha reached forward.</p><p>“May I?” she asked, just above a whisper.</p><p>Rio nodded once.</p><p>Agatha lifted the cloth and began to clean the small amount of dried blood from Rio’s temple. Her fingers were steady, but her throat was tight.</p><p>The scrape was shallow.</p><p>But it was real.</p><p>Proof of the risk she’d taken. Of the body she’d thrown into danger for someone else’s child.</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have moved that fast,” she murmured. “You could’ve broken your neck.”</p><p>Rio didn’t understand the words, not fully. But she understood the tone.</p><p>Not angry.</p><p>Worried.</p><p>She tilted her head slightly into Agatha’s hand.</p><p>Agatha’s voice dropped even softer. “You keep doing that—making me feel things I’m not prepared to feel.”</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>Then reached up—slowly—and took Agatha’s wrist in her hand.</p><p>Held it. Gently.</p><p>Agatha stilled.</p><p>Rio leaned forward until their foreheads touched.</p><p>Then she did something that undid Agatha completely.</p><p>She licked her palm.</p><p>Not playfully.</p><p>Not wolfishly.</p><p>With reverence.</p><p>Like she had the night of the failed ritual—when Agatha’s magic had buckled, and Rio had healed her with nothing but instinct and love.</p><p>Agatha let out a breathless laugh. “Gods, you really are ridiculous.”</p><p>But she was already leaning in.</p><p>Her hand slid to the back of Rio’s neck. Her thumb brushed the edge of the once-collared skin.</p><p>She pressed a kiss to Rio’s temple, just above the scrape.</p><p>Then another to her cheek.</p><p>Then one—so soft, so slow—at the corner of her mouth.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes.</p><p>Agatha whispered, “You terrified me today.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head.</p><p>Agatha kissed her again, this time full on the mouth.</p><p>“You also made me so damn proud.”</p><p>Rio grinned.</p><p>Sharp-toothed. Beautiful.</p><p>She leaned forward until their chests pressed together and wrapped her arms around Agatha’s back, tucking her nose beneath her jaw.</p><p>Safe.</p><p>Warm.</p><p>Home.</p><p>Agatha held her like she was the most precious, most chaotic, most deeply adored thing on earth.</p><p>Which, of course, she was.</p><p>A sudden knock startled them both— sharp against the quiet, like a pebble dropped in still water.</p><p>Rio’s head sharpened towards the sound, ears almost visibly prickling. She shifted her weight, instinctively placing herself between the door and Agatha as though danger might have followed them home. </p><p>Agatha’s mouth twitched— half amusement, half affection— as she laid a hand briefly against Rio’s arm. “It’s alright,” she murmured, stepping around her. </p><p>She unlatched the door and pulled it open.</p><p>On the step stood the little girl from the market, tucked shyly against her mother’s side, her small fists twisting in the folds of her mother’s skirt. The woman’s eyes were still wet around the edges, her gratitude etched deep enough that it seemed part of her expression now. </p><p>“I just… I needed to thank you a gain,” the mother said, voice catching as though she’d repeated this to herself on the walk over. In her hands she held a small woven basket, its cloth covering slightly askew, letting out the warm, buttery scent of freshly baked muffins. “These are for you both.”</p><p>Agatha accepted it with the poised ease of someone who knew how to accept a gift without letting her own emotions spill too far. Her fingers brushed the handle, warm from the woman’s hands. “Thats very kind of you,” she said, soft but steady.</p><p>The little girl peeked out from “My name’s Cora,” she announced in a voice both timid and sure.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, watching her as though the name itself were something she might need to memorise for later. </p><p>Cora stepped forward, one small hand unfurling to reveal a single wildflower— its stem a little bent, petals slightly bruised from the walk. She held it out to Rio with all the solemnity of an offering.</p><p>Rio accepted it with surprising care, the pads of her fingers brushing Cora’s as she took it. She turned it over once, studying the petals as if trying to decode its purpose. </p><p>Then she leaned forward, sniffed it once— sharp and assessing— and without the faintest hesitation, popped the entire bloom into her mouth and began chewing. </p><p>Cora’s eyes went round in shock before her mouth split into a delighted giggle. The sound burst out of her, pure and high, like it had been waiting inside her all day.</p><p>Agatha groaned softly, pressing her fingertips to her brow. “We’re still working on her manners… and speech,” she said,  her voice dry but unmistakably fond, a note of pride curling beneath the exasperation.</p><p>Cora’s mother only smiled, shaking her head.</p><p>“She’s perfect as she is.”</p><p>Agatha inclined her head at that— whether in agreement or quiet thanks, even she might not have known— and stepped back inside, the basket still warm in her hands. </p><p>Rio lingered in the doorway for a breath longer, her eyes fixed on Cora as though committing her scent, her laugh, and the shape of her name to memory.</p><p>Halfway down the lane,  Cora glanced over her shoulder and raised her fingers in a small, shy wave.</p><p>Rio’s head tilted, ears almost twitching at the gesture. She didn’t wave back— just stood very still, watching, her gaze following until the pair dissapeared around the bend.</p><p>Only then did she turn, following Agatha into the kitchen with slow, deliberate steps.</p><p>Agatha set the basket on the counter, pulling back the cloth to peek inside. The muffins were still warm, the tops glossy with a faint sheen of honey. She inhaled once, then glanced up to find Rio standing in the middle of the room like she wasn’t sure where to put herself. </p><p>Agatha’s expression softened, she walked over, brushing her fingertips along the edge of Rio’s jaw. “You did something good today.”</p><p>Rio blinked at her, searching her face as though weighing the truth in her voice. Her hand lifted hesitantly, resting over Agatha’s hip— gentle, like she was touching something fragile. </p><p>Agatha let the moment breathe, her own hand sliding to the back of Rio’s neck and ran her fingers through her tangled hair, thumbs brushing the short bun she’d tied days ago. The spot above Rio’s temple, where the scrape had bled, was still raw and angry but already healing.</p><p>The tenderness of it all—that she could bleed, that she could heal, that she had chosen to stay close when she could’ve run—broke something open in Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“You want to go to bed?” she whispered.</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “Sleep?”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Eventually.”</p><p>She offered her hand.</p><p>Rio took it.</p><p>Agatha led her across the room, their bare feet quiet on the wood. Outside, night had gathered fully now. No lamps were lit. Only the fire crackling low and slow in the hearth, casting amber shadows against the walls.</p><p>Their bed was unmade—blanket half-draped, pillows uneven.</p><p>Agatha sat down first.</p><p>Rio stood for a moment longer, watching her with something closer to awe than hunger. Her eyes traced every inch of Agatha’s face like she was still learning her.</p><p>Agatha reached for the hem of Rio’s shirt and whispered, “Let me.”</p><p>Rio nodded, slow.</p><p>Agatha untucked the shirt carefully, fingers brushing bare skin as she moved. The first button slipped free beneath her touch. Then the second. She did not rush. She looked up into Rio’s eyes after each one, waiting.</p><p>Rio didn’t move.</p><p>Didn’t look away.</p><p>By the fourth button, Agatha’s breath had shortened. She could feel heat rising under her own skin.</p><p>The last button came free.</p><p>She pushed the shirt off Rio’s shoulders slowly.</p><p>Rio’s chest rose and fell with careful breaths. Her body—sculpted from hardship and survival—was marked with small scars and tan lines, muscle running taut beneath skin that was still just beginning to trust being seen. Beneath her trousers, the outline of her arousal was already visible, thick and straining against the worn fabric.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze lingered, but her touch remained gentle. She slid her palms down Rio’s arms as the shirt fell to the floor.</p><p>“You’re beautiful,” she said softly.</p><p>Rio blinked. Then, as if the weight of the word made her unsure, she stepped forward and nudged her forehead against Agatha’s brow again.</p><p>She didn’t say anything.</p><p>She didn’t need to.</p><p>Agatha cupped the back of her neck and kissed her.</p><p>Longer this time.</p><p>Slower.</p><p>The kind of kiss that opened the chest without needing a key.</p><p>Rio deepened it with a low sound in her throat, her hands finally sliding along Agatha’s hips—tentative, but full of intent. </p><p>Agatha stepped back just far enough to reach for her own robe, letting it fall. Beneath it, a thin shift clung to her skin. Rio’s hands reached for it reverently, sliding the fabric from her shoulders.</p><p>Agatha stood bare in front of her.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught. She knelt, pressing her face to Agatha’s stomach, arms wrapped tight around her waist, before Agatha drew her down to the bed with her.</p><p>They lay tangled, the heat between them blooming. Rio’s hands mapped her with care— ribs, waist, hips— before slipping lower, coaxing a gasp from Agatha. She kissed along Agatha’s chest, leaning her reactions, listening to every sound.</p><p>Agatha’s hand slid down, cupping the hard, hot length between Rio’s thighs through the trousers. Rio shuddered, breath breaking, her hips rocking instinctively. Agatha worked the fastening loose, sliding the trousers and underclothes away, baring her fully.</p><p>Rio’s cock was thick, flushed, the head damp with anticipation. Agatha wrapped her fingers around her, stroking slowly, watching Rio’s eyes darken and her mouth part.</p><p>Agatha kissed her again, guiding her until Rio hovered between her thighs. She hooked her knees around Rio’s hips, pulling her closer, wanting her closer, their breaths mingling in the warm space between their mouths. </p><p>“Come here,” she murmured, the words low, steady, threaded with something darker than invitation— a need that had been simmering since the market, since she’d watched Rio cradle that child like she was made for protection.</p><p>Rio obeyed instantly, lowering her hips until Agatha could feel the thick, hot weight of her pressing at her entrance. Agatha’s breath caught, her head tipping back just for a second.</p><p>“Oh gods…” the sound was half plea, half prayer.</p><p>Rio’s hands framed her face, thumbs brushing her cheekbones as she pushed forward, slow only because she wanted Agatha to feel every inch. Agatha’s nails bit into Rio’s shoulders, her thighs tightening around her hips.</p><p>She thought, with dizzy clarity, She’s mine. Every breath, every heartbeat, every inch of her is mine.</p><p>Rio groaned— deep, guttural— as she sank fully inside. Forehead to forehead, they breathed each other’s air. </p><p>“Feel…” Rio’s voice was rough, the words breaking apart on her tongue.”... good.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth curved, but her voice was breathless. “Then move, lobe. Give me all of it.”</p><p>Rio’s hips began to roll, finding a rhythm that made Agatha’s spine arch and her breath stutter. The stretch was exquisite, the deep drop of each thrust sparking heat low in her belly. Every time Rio drove into her, Agatha felt the press of her, thick and solid, hitting the places that made her toes curl.</p><p>Her thoughts blurred into sensation— the warmth of Rio’s skin, the soft rasp of her breath in her ear, the way she never looked away even as their bodies met again and again.</p><p>Agatha moaned openly now, letting her voice fill the room, unashamed of the sounds she made. She wanted Rio to hear them, to know exactly what she was doing to her. </p><p>“Harder,” she gasped when Rio angled her hips just right. “Yes— right there—“<br/>Rio answerd with a sharp thrust that stole Agatha’s breath, then slowed just enough to draw another sound from her.</p><p>She was close— she could feel it building, a tight, relentless coil that made her cling harder to Rio, nails raking lightly down her back.</p><p>“Ag…atha…” Rio’s voice cracked on her name, as if she were giving it back as an offering.</p><p>“Don’t stop,” Agatha whispered, eyes locking with hers. “Don’t you dare stop.”</p><p>The tension snapped. Heat flooded through her, her body clenching hard around Rio, her voice breaking into a low, shaking cry. The sensation pulled Rio over the edge with her, a rough groan tearing from her throat as she thrust deep, spilling insider her in long shuddering pulses.</p><p>They stayed like that, pressed together, chests heaving, hearts pounding in sync.</p><p>Agatha felt the hot rush inside her, felt Rio’s weight still anchoring her, and thought— not for the first time— that there was nothing in this world she would not burn for her. </p><p>Rio’s lips brushed her temple, whispering her name again, softer this time, like it meant home.</p><p>Agatha pulled her down, kissed her slow, and held her there until the world outside the bed no longer mattered. </p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>The first sound was distant.</p><p>A low hum, almost imperceptible—like the earth beneath the roots had taken a breath and forgotten how to hold it.</p><p>Agatha stirred.</p><p>She lay on her side, the blanket tangled around her hips, Rio’s arm slung heavily over her waist. Rio still slept, her breath slow and deep against the back of Agatha’s neck, warm and soft in the hollow of her shoulder.</p><p>Outside, the trees shifted.</p><p>Not from wind.</p><p>From pressure.</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes.</p><p>Something was… off.</p><p>The birds weren’t singing. The bees, usually humming through the rosemary by the window, were gone.</p><p>She slid out of bed carefully, so as not to wake Rio. The wolf grumbled softly in her sleep, fingers twitching, but didn’t rise.</p><p>Agatha pulled on her robe and padded barefoot across the floor to the door.</p><p>She didn’t need a spell to feel it.</p><p>The air had changed.</p><p>She opened the door slowly.</p><p>The morning looked the same—soft light filtering through the trees, dew glistening on the grass, the usual mist hovering low across the field.</p><p>But every hair on Agatha’s arms stood up.</p><p>She stepped out into the clearing.</p><p>Then she heard it.</p><p><strong>Snap</strong>.</p><p>Like a rope pulled too tight.</p><p>Like a bone breaking just below the skin.</p><p>It wasn’t near the house.</p><p>It was in the <em>northern line of the wards</em>—the part of the forest none of the locals entered. Where the trees grew too tall and the moss covered things better left forgotten.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened.</p><p>Another snap.</p><p>A ripple moved through the trees—like something large brushing against the boundary that had kept Salem safe for generations.</p><p>Then a sound—not loud, but felt.</p><p>A <em>clicking</em>.</p><p>Insect-like.</p><p>Wet.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move.</p><p>Didn’t breathe.</p><p>A figure stepped through the mist.</p><p>Not fully formed.</p><p>Hunched.</p><p>Too tall.</p><p>Eyes glowing low and green, set wide apart on either side of a gaping, lipless mouth.</p><p>It sniffed the air. Tilted its head.</p><p>It stepped across the broken ward circle as if it had never been there.</p><p>Then it grinned.</p><p>Not at Agatha.</p><p>Past her.</p><p>Toward the house.</p><p>Toward the sleeping god on her bed.</p><p>Agatha whispered a word under her breath.</p><p>And the sky above them darkened.</p><p>It had not spoken.</p><p>But Agatha could hear it in her bones.</p><p>It wanted her.</p><p>Or worse—what lay behind her, sleeping in the cottage.</p><p>Agatha stepped forward, robes fluttering faintly with power. She stretched out one arm behind her, barring the path to the open door.</p><p>“You don’t belong here,” she said, voice low and tight.</p><p>The creature twitched, then stilled.</p><p>It tilted its head.</p><p>Sniffed the air.</p><p>The glow beneath its skin pulsed faster.</p><p>“You’re not touching her,” Agatha said sharply. “Not while I’m breathing.”</p><p>The creature’s head cocked.</p><p>It took a step forward.</p><p>Agatha raised her hands and let the magic rise—purple light curling from her fingertips, hot and sharp like a storm about to break. Runes danced up her arms. Her lips moved in a near-silent incantation, ancient and burning.</p><p>The thing hissed.</p><p>Its body rippled. Shifted.</p><p>Then it lunged.</p><p>Straight for her.</p><p>Agatha pivoted hard, unleashing the spell in a tight arc— a blade of crackling violet energy that caught the creature across its chest. The impact made it stagger back with a screech, dark ichor sizzling where the magic had struck.</p><p>But pain only made it faster.</p><p>It surged forward again, claws sweeping low. Agatha tried to block, but the force of the blow slammed into her ribs, knocking the air from her lungs and hurling her several feet back into the dirt. The wold blurred; she felt the sting of scraped palms and the sharp pulse of pain in her side.</p><p>She pushed up onto one elbow, vision swimming, just in time to see the creature turning towards her.</p><p>Then—</p><p>From the shadows of the cottage— a growl.</p><p>Deep. Ancient. </p><p>A blur of movement— bare feet hammering the floorboards— and then Rio was there, framed in the doorway, golden eyes blazing. She looked half-wild, half-awake, shirt hanging open, hair loose around her face.</p><p>The sound she made was not human.</p><p>The creature froze.</p><p>Then Rio moved. </p><p>She hit it like a falling tree, her shoulder driving into its midsection, knocking it off its feet with a wet thud. Before it could recover, she was on top of it— pinning it, her hand locking around its throat.</p><p>The monster thrashed, claws scraping at her arms, but she slammed its head into the ground with such force the earth seemed to jolt between them. It tried once to rake her side— but she caught its wrist mid-swipe, twisted until bone snapped, and tore it free of her entirely.</p><p>Her other hand drove into its chest. There was a sharp crack— not bone, but something deeper— and then it went limp.</p><p>The clearing was suddenly, earily quiet.</p><p>Rio stood over it, breathing hard, ichor splattered across her skin. She glanced once at the corpse— then turned sharply toward Agatha. </p><p>The glow in her eyes dimmed.</p><p>She was at her side in two strides, dropping to her knees, her hands cupping Agatha’s face before she could speak.</p><p>“Agatha.” She whimpered, the sound raw and desperate. She scanned her quickly, eyes darting to her ribs, her hands, her cheek. </p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha managed, though her breath shook.</p><p>Rio didn’t believe her. </p><p>Her gaze locked on a shallow cut along Agatha’s jaw, and before Agatha could say a word, Rio leaned in and dragged her tongue over it— slow, deliberate, almost reverent. The warmth of it sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine, when Rio pulled away, the sting was gone. </p><p>She found the scrape of Agatha’s elbow next, taking her arm and licking across it with the same quiet focus, as if tending a wound was as natural as breathing. The touch was gentle, but the way Rio’s eyes stayed fixed on her face made it feel intimate, unshakable. </p><p>Agatha’s chest ached— not from the blow, but from the way Rio was looking at her. </p><p>“I’m okay” she whispered, curling her hands into Rio’s hair. “I’m okay, my love”</p><p>Rio pressed closer, nuzzling under her chin with a shiver that was pure relief.</p><p>Then without warning, Rio slipped her arms under Agatha’s knees and back, lifting her clean off the ground as though she weighed nothing. </p><p>“Rio—!” Agatha startled, half-protesting, half-laughing as her arms looped instinctively around Rio’s neck. “Put me down, I can walk!”</p><p>Rio ignored her entirely, the corner of her mouth twitching in something that might have been a smirk, if she weren’t still trembling from adrenaline. </p><p>She carried her side, barefoot steps stead despite the blood and ichor drying on her skin, and set her gently down on the couch as if she might break.</p><p>Agatha huffed, still smiling despite herself, “You’re ridiculous.”</p><p>Rio only knelt beside her, gaze never leaving her face, as if to confirm again and again that she was still there.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The candle went out without a breath.</p><p>Wanda lifted her head from her notes, fingers stilling over the vellum page. The sigils she had been translating shivered, ink twitching slightly—as though the parchment itself felt the wound tearing through the forest’s weave.</p><p>The air changed.</p><p>Heavy.</p><p>Sharp.</p><p>Blood-scented.</p><p>Then—<em>there</em>.</p><p>A <strong>pulse</strong>.</p><p>Not magical. Not elemental.</p><p>
<strong>Divine.</strong>
</p><p>Wanda stood.</p><p>A small wardstone on her shelf cracked straight down the centre. Its light flickered once, then died.</p><p>She crossed the chamber to the wide circular window that overlooked the eastern woods.</p><p>Mist curled at the tree line. Leaves turned inward, like they too were listening. Something had died.</p><p>Something <em>old</em> had been reminded of <strong>who she was</strong>.</p><p>Wanda pressed her fingers to the glass and whispered, “The wolf.”</p><p>Not a question.</p><p>She’d known it was only a matter of time. She’d felt it stirring since the collar cracked. Since the tides shifted around the northern boundary line. But this—this was different.</p><p>This was a claim.</p><p>A declaration.</p><p>She turned back toward the shelves, pulling a leather-bound ledger from the top row, flipping through pages marked with the names of beings long buried or bound. Her gaze stopped at a familiar entry:</p><p>
<em>Moonborn. Bound in green. Forgotten in flesh.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Kept asleep by blood rite.</em>
</p><p>
<em>If awakened and transformed: Do not isolate. Do not cage. Do not confront alone.</em>
</p><p>Wanda closed the book gently.</p><p>Others would feel the break too.</p><p>The Crag-born things. The witches of the outer courts. The ones who whispered Agatha’s name with suspicion. They would hear of the creature that crossed into Salem. Of its death. Of the woman who killed it with <em>her hands.</em></p><p>And of the witch who stood beside her.</p><p>Wanda didn’t fear Rio.</p><p>She feared what people would do to a god they didn’t understand.</p><p>The chamber doors didn’t just open—they burst inward, slamming against the stone with a sound like a snapped bone. The candle stubs on Wanda’s desk guttered in the draft.</p><p>Five council envoys swept inside, their robes whispering like dry leaves, the air around them smelling of cold rain and old iron. At their head was Mora—tall, gaunt, and draped in midnight blue, her silver hair bound in a severe braid that hung like a length of rope. Her eyes locked on Wanda with the precision of a hawk sighting prey.</p><p>She didn’t wait for invitation. With a sharp gesture, she slammed a scroll onto the desk, the force rattling the ink bottle. The parchment unfurled in a single snap, groaning under its own age. Black and rust-red inks told the story—villages burning, bodies fleeing through snow, a monstrous wolf tearing through wood and stone beneath the jagged cliffs of the Crag. Above each atrocity, the Queen’s sigil loomed like a curse.</p><p>And in every painted eye—Rio.</p><p>“The Crag <em>know</em> she’s in Salem,” Mora said, her voice cutting through the chamber like a blade through cloth. “Their riders are already moving. Their ships will come under moonless skies. They will not stop until she is theirs again. We cannot allow that. She must be destroyed before they get their weapon back.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t glance at the scroll. “She is not their weapon.”</p><p>“She <em>was</em>,” Mora shot back, stepping closer. “And the bond is older than your line, older than Agatha’s. You know what happens when the Crag claims what is theirs.”</p><p>“She is not theirs,” Wanda said, voice low but steady. “Not anymore. Agatha has her. She’s not bound—she’s cared for. Protected. The woman you’re talking about is not the creature in your ink.”</p><p>Mora’s eyes narrowed to slits. “You think care will stop the Crag Queen? You think love will keep her from answering their call?”</p><p>“I think she’s already answered a different one,” Wanda replied. “And I think if you touch her, you’ll find the forest does not choose the council over its own.”</p><p>The tension in the room was a wire drawn to breaking. Behind Mora, one of the envoys shifted—a hunter’s restlessness in the presence of prey.</p><p>The council had not come to deliberate. They had come to warn.</p><p>And to prepare for war.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>Agatha dragged a clean cloth across Rio’s shoulder, gently wiping away the last of the black blood. The scratches had already begun to close. That wasn’t the magic—it was Rio. Her body healing faster than nature intended. The skin there still pulsed faintly with power, like moonlight under water.</p><p>Rio sat on the floor beside the hearth now, shirt off, eyes half-lidded. Tired. Watching.</p><p>Her cheek was bruised from the impact.</p><p>But she hadn’t made a sound since the fight.</p><p>Agatha sat back on her heels, set the cloth down, and reached for the salve on the table.</p><p>“We’ll have to reinforce the wards,” she murmured, voice low. “That thing didn’t get through by accident. It was pulled. It <em>felt</em> you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer.</p><p>Instead—<strong>she lifted her head</strong>.</p><p>Sniffed the air.</p><p>Then stood in a smooth, animal motion that sent a jolt of alarm through Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“What is it?” she asked, already rising to her feet.</p><p>Rio growled low—not a threat. A warning.</p><p>She turned slowly toward the front of the cottage, eyes glowing faintly again.</p><p>Her voice, when it came, was barely above a whisper.</p><p>“Red.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “What?”</p><p>Rio took a slow step toward the door. “Red…woman.”</p><p>Before Agatha could question it, a soft knock echoed through the wood.</p><p>Three gentle raps.</p><p>Then a pause.</p><p>Then two more.</p><p>Agatha exhaled. “Wanda.”</p><p>Rio stood frozen.</p><p>Not hostile.</p><p>But coiled.</p><p>She didn’t trust her.</p><p>Didn’t trust anyone.</p><p>Agatha reached for her hand.</p><p>“She’s not here to hurt us.”</p><p>Rio didn’t move.</p><p>“She’s old magic,” Agatha added. “But not a hunter. Just a watcher.”</p><p>Rio’s lips pulled back faintly—not quite a snarl. Her voice was raw. “Watch…<em>me?</em>”</p><p>Agatha nodded once. Honest. “Yes.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tensed.</p><p>But she let her hand be held.</p><p>Agatha pressed a kiss to the knuckles of her fingers.</p><p>“Let me open the door.”</p><p><br/>The door creaked open on slow hinges.</p><p>Wanda stood just beyond the threshold, her crimson shawl drawn around her shoulders, her face calm, unreadable.</p><p>Her eyes—sharp and dark as obsidian—flicked instantly to Rio.</p><p>They didn’t linger on Agatha.</p><p>Not this time.</p><p>Not when <strong>that presence</strong> filled the room like a second fire.</p><p>Rio stood barefoot on the floorboards, golden eyes locked onto Wanda’s. Her shoulders were still bare, skin streaked faintly with dried blood, muscles tight under scar and moonlight. She didn’t move.</p><p>Neither did Wanda.</p><p>Agatha stepped between them—not to shield, not to block, but to bridge.</p><p>“Come in,” she said softly.</p><p>Wanda inclined her head and crossed the threshold.</p><p>She made no sudden movements. No attempt to approach. She simply entered the space, moving like water around a stone, letting her magic stretch gently into the corners of the room without touching anything.</p><p>Rio’s eyes followed her every step.</p><p>When Wanda finally stopped, she didn’t look at Agatha.</p><p>She looked only at Rio.</p><p>“You’re stronger than the stories said,” she murmured. “Faster, too.”</p><p>Rio bared her teeth.</p><p>Not a smile.</p><p>Not quite a threat.</p><p>Agatha stepped back to her side. “She doesn’t understand you.”</p><p>“She understands enough,” Wanda said.</p><p>Then, softer: “You killed a Crag-spawn. You tore it apart with your hands.”</p><p>She said it not with fear.</p><p>Not with admiration.</p><p>Just fact.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer. But her posture changed—ever so slightly. Chin lifted. Shoulders broader. A little prouder.</p><p>Agatha watched her.</p><p>And Wanda did too.</p><p>“You protected her,” Wanda added, eyes narrowing just slightly.</p><p>“That matters to me.”</p><p>Rio glanced sideways at Agatha. Her lips twitched. A sound escaped her—soft and amused, almost a huff.</p><p>Then she stepped forward once.</p><p>Just one step.</p><p>Close enough to show she wasn’t afraid.</p><p>Close enough to make Wanda choose whether to flinch.</p><p>She didn’t.</p><p>Instead, Wanda pulled a small object from her pocket and set it on the table. A carved wooden disc—etched with circles, not runes. No language. Just movement.</p><p>“What’s that?” Agatha asked quietly.</p><p>Wanda didn’t look away from Rio. “A token of neutrality. It will mark your cottage as watched—not claimed. It will tell the other witches not to interfere. For now.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head.</p><p>Sniffed the air.</p><p>Then stepped closer to the table and tapped the disc with her finger.</p><p>It pulsed faintly.</p><p>Accepted.</p><p>Wanda let out a slow breath.</p><p>Then turned to Agatha.</p><p>“They’ll still come,” she said. “To test her. Try claim her.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha replied.</p><p>“I came first because I respect what she is. What you’re doing. But Agatha…” Wanda’s eyes softened, finally. “Even power that comes from love is still <strong>power</strong>. You need to be ready.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice didn’t tremble. “I am.”</p><p>Rio stepped beside her.</p><p>Wanda looked at them together.</p><p>And nodded.</p><p>Then turned toward the door.</p><p>As she stepped outside, she paused—just once—and said without looking back:</p><p>“She’s not a wolf.”</p><p>“She’s the reason they learned to fear the dark.”</p><p>Then she disappeared into the mist.</p><p><br/>The cottage door shut with a soft thud.</p><p>Outside, the mist had swallowed Wanda whole. Her token pulsed faintly on the wooden table, its glow a quiet, steady heartbeat. Not a warning. Not a curse. Just a mark—a message to the watching world:</p><p>
<em>This place is under notice.</em>
</p><p>Agatha stood in silence for a long moment, her arms loose at her sides. She was thinking too fast to speak. Thinking of words that weren’t hers. Names Wanda hadn’t said aloud. Things that might not knock before crossing the line next time.</p><p>Behind her, Rio moved.</p><p>She circled the table like she was still tracking Wanda’s scent, nostrils flaring. Her bare feet made no sound. Her shoulders stayed square, posture tall—but there was something in the tension of her jaw that made Agatha turn.</p><p>“Rio?” she asked.</p><p>Rio stopped.</p><p>She looked down at the token.</p><p>Then up.</p><p>And pointed.</p><p>“More?” she asked.</p><p>Agatha exhaled. Sat down at the table and nodded. “Yes. More will come.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes didn’t narrow. They dropped.</p><p>She looked toward the door. The clearing. Then at the floor.</p><p>She didn’t speak again for a long time.</p><p>Agatha watched her.</p><p>Rio walked to the hearth and crouched, arms resting on her knees. She reached for one of the small logs, ran her fingers over it slowly, then placed it down without feeding the fire.</p><p>Then she said, voice lower this time: “You… get hurt.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “What?”</p><p>Rio turned to her.</p><p>She tapped her own chest. “Me.” Then reached toward Agatha. “You. Hurt.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest ached.</p><p>She crossed the room and sat beside her on the floor.</p><p>“I’m not hurt,” she said softly. “You protected me.”</p><p>Rio shook her head slowly.</p><p>She looked at the hearth.</p><p>“Again,” she said.</p><p>It wasn’t just a guess.</p><p>It was instinct.</p><p>Agatha didn’t deny it.</p><p>She leaned into Rio, resting her shoulder against hers. “Yes. More might come. And yes, some of them will want you dead. Or worse.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched.</p><p>She turned her face away.</p><p>“I go.”</p><p>Agatha froze. “What?”</p><p>“I go. Away.” She stood, slow, deliberate. “You… stay.”</p><p>Agatha rose with her.</p><p>“No,” she said, quiet but firm. “You don’t get to do that.”</p><p>Rio’s golden eyes met hers.</p><p>“You’re not protecting me by running,” Agatha whispered. “You’re not dangerous to me. What’s coming—that’s the danger. You’re the reason I’m still breathing.”</p><p>Rio’s throat worked.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, hand lifting to her cheek.</p><p>“I would rather stand beside you and bleed than live behind you and wonder if you’re still alive.”</p><p>Rio flinched.</p><p>Her lips trembled slightly, her hands balled into fists at her sides.</p><p>Agatha pressed her forehead to Rio’s, voice rough: “Don’t take this from me. Don’t take <em>you</em> from me.”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond with words.</p><p>But her arms went around Agatha’s waist, fierce and fast, and she buried her face in her neck—<em>hiding</em>, just for a moment.</p><p>Agatha held her.</p><p>And in the silence between them, the token on the table pulsed again.</p><p>Not louder.</p><p>Just closer.</p><p>Because <strong>they would come</strong>.</p><p>But not all of them would leave.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>Later, when the fire had burned low and the sky outside had gone soft with ash-colored stars, Agatha curled up in the old armchair beside the hearth. A book lay in her lap, but she hadn’t turned the page in twenty minutes.</p><p>Rio sat on the floor.</p><p>She always sat on the floor.</p><p>Blanket wrapped around her bare shoulders. Bare feet pressed to the stone. Her eyes, golden in the firelight, flicked from the flame to Agatha’s face. Then away. Then back again.</p><p>Agatha didn’t speak.</p><p>She’d learned now to wait.</p><p>Rio’s fingers twitched in the folds of the blanket. Her lips parted once. Then closed. Then—</p><p>“Word,” she said finally.</p><p>Agatha looked up. “Hmm?”</p><p>Rio sat straighter. Her brow furrowed. “I want…”</p><p>She trailed off. Searching.</p><p>Then reached toward Agatha, hand resting lightly over her heart. Not possessive. Just there.</p><p>Then she pointed to herself.</p><p>And tilted her head, confused.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Me… and you?”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“Together?”</p><p>Rio nodded again.</p><p>Agatha smiled softly. “You already know that word.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “Not love. Not kiss.” She tapped the floor between them. “When… I am here.”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>Her voice was soft. Careful.</p><p>“Close.”</p><p>Agatha closed the book in her lap.</p><p>She leaned forward.</p><p>“You want a word for what it feels like when you’re near me?”</p><p>Rio hesitated. Then gave the smallest nod.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes searched hers for a moment—gentle, fond, unguarded. She reached across the space between them and laid her hand over Rio’s, threading their fingers.</p><p>“Safe,” she whispered. “The word is safe.”</p><p>Rio repeated it slowly. “Safe.”</p><p>She mouthed it again. Then again.</p><p>Soft.</p><p>Like it might break.</p><p>She leaned forward and rested her head on Agatha’s knee, closing her eyes.</p><p>And Agatha—heart aching—brushed her fingers through her hair.</p><p>“You are,” she said, almost too softly to hear. “With me, you always are.”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond.</p><p>But the way she breathed into the silence was answer enough.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>On the outermost edge of Salem’s boundary, the trees leaned in as if listening.</p><p>The soil was wet there. Still dark with the blood of the last thing that tried to breach it. The wardline, even cracked, hummed faintly—like old glass under strain. Wanda’s token, set back at the Harkness cottage, did its work well enough to warn.</p><p>But it could not stop what came next.</p><p>The first sign wasn’t a sound.</p><p>It was the absence of one.</p><p>Birds stopped singing.</p><p>Insects vanished from the grass.</p><p>Even the wind fell still—hanging motionless in the canopy like something holding its breath.</p><p>Then, a footstep.</p><p>Bare.</p><p>Human-shaped.</p><p>But wrong in weight.</p><p>It didn’t press the soil like a person. It floated just above it, each print fading as soon as it landed.</p><p>Another step.</p><p>And then she appeared from between the trees.</p><p>A hood shadowed most of her face, but her mouth—if one could call it that—was slick and dark with old blood, the skin torn at the corners as though something inside her had tried to grin wider than a human jaw should allow. Her lips never moved, but the hunger in her eyes did.</p><p>She walked slowly, almost lazily, each movement a quiet promise. A necklace of bone fragments swayed against her chest, the pieces etched with symbols older than the town itself. Where her hand brushed a tree, the bark split and blackened.</p><p>From a distance, the cottage looked dim—one hearth fire still glowing, two silhouettes at rest inside. The wolf. And the witch.</p><p>She tilted her head, studying.</p><p>The wardline quivered under her gaze.</p><p>She reached into the folds of her cloak and drew out a small shard of green metal, twisted and ancient—a perfect match for the collar. She turned it once between her fingers, and her teeth bared in something not quite a smile.</p><p>Her voice came without breath, sliding through the forest like oil on water:</p><p>
<em>She is not alone.</em>
</p><p>
<em>We will come again with a lure you cannot decline.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The witch turned, retreating into the trees.</p><p>The ward behind her sizzled faintly—</p><p>—and cracked a little more.</p><p><br/>⸻</p><p><br/>It had been a week since Wanda had last visited.</p><p>Agatha had left at first light, cloak drawn close, heading into the denser part of Salem to meet her. The wards along her land had held through the week, but the hairline fractures she’d felt beneath her magic were enough to pull her from the warmth of the cottage. </p><p>They’d walked the outer perimeter together, Wanda muttering under her breath as she pressed fresh sigils into the earth and reinforced the older lines. <br/>They spoke quietly, trading knowledge— about the last breach, about what could pass through a half-broken barrier, about the kind of hungers that waited for a lapse in vigilance. </p><p>By the time Agatha had returned the sun had shifted high enough to spill pale gold across the garden. She pushed open the small gate— already thinking of the tea she’d make, and whether Rio had eaten yet— </p><p>—and stopped.</p><p>In the far corner of the garden, under the shade of a wild pear tree, Rio was crouched low on her haunches before a little stone table and a circle of lopsided rock “chairs.” Across from her sat Cora, all knees and braids, a tiny porcelain tea set arranged between them.</p><p>Rio’s messy hair was threaded through with fresh daisies, crooked in places as though Cora had been placing them one by one without asking permission. Her great frame was folded down small, shoulders rounded to match the girls’s level, hands carefully holding a cup so dainty it looked absurd in her broad fingers.</p><p>Cora poured tea with the careful ceremony of a queen, then tapped the cup in front of Rio. “Say it,” she instructed. </p><p>Rio tilted her head, watching her mouth intently, “…T-uhh…cup?”</p><p>“Teacup,” Cora corrected, giggling when Rio’s tongue stumbled on the ‘p’.</p><p>Rio tried again slow and deliberate. “Tea…cup.”</p><p>Cora’s grin lit her whole face. She passed another small saucer across, and Rio’s fingernails— blunt from Agatha’s careful tending— still clinked against the porcelain. She froze at the sound, eyes darting to Cora’s.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Cora said, voice bright. “Here— try saucer.”</p><p>Rio attempted it, mangling the middle sound so thoroughly Cora burst into helpless laughter, the kind only children could manager— pure and spilling over like sunlight. </p><p>From where she stood at the gate, Agatha felt her chest tighten in a way that had nothing to do with fear.</p><p>Her wolf— her towering, uncontainable wolf— was hunched over a make-believe table, letting a five year old correct her words, accepting flowers in her hair without a single grumble, and looking at the child like she was something precious to be guarded. </p><p>Agatha’s hand tightened on the gatepost, her breath catching against the unexpected weight in her throat. </p><p>She didn’t move.<br/>Didn’t speak.<br/>Just watched.</p><p>The way Rio bent her head to listen. The way her huge hands— capable of snapping a mans neck in a blink— curled delicately around a porcelain cup because a little girl had asked her to.</p><p>And— just for a moment, in he quiet shade of that wild pear tree— Agatha let herself imagine.</p><p>Her and Rio’s own child. </p><p>Not a fleeting guest in their garden, but one who would run barefoot through these rows everyday, scattering petals and laughter in equal measure. A child with Rio’s wild eyes and steady strength, with her own sharp mind and unyielding will. Would they have her hair or Rio’s? Would they be quick to growl, or quick to smile?</p><p>She felt the thought sink claws into her chest before she could pull it back. Was it even <em>possible</em>? Witches had their own ways, wolves their own bloodlines, and what hey shared now was a thing that defied most natural rules. But if there were magic in the world strong enough to keep Rio with her, perhaps there was magic enough to give them <strong>that</strong> too.</p><p>Cora’s laughter yanked her gently from the thought. Rio had mispronounced “spoon,” and was now nodding gravely as if to promise she’d get it right next time. </p><p>Agatha’s lips curved—</p><p>—but her gaze flicked past the garden wall. </p><p>Something stirred at the edge of the trees. A figure? A shadow? The shape was wrong for a deer, too tall for a fox, and too still for anything meant to be there. </p><p>The air seemed to hold its breath.</p><p>Then, as if sensing her notice, the shape eased back into the dappled dark, leaving only the swap of leaves where it had been.</p><p>Agatha stepped inside the gate, her smile softening again— but she didn’t stop scanning the tree line.</p><p>Just incase. <br/> </p><p><br/>——</p><p><br/>That night, the wards hummed faintly under Agatha’s skin as she locked the cottage door. Whatever had lingered at the tree line hadn’t crossed, but she’d walked the perimeter twice before dusk, whispering strength into every fracture.</p><p>Rio had been quiet after dinner—not withdrawn, just steeped in that still, listening way of hers. She’d let herself be guided through a bath, hair damp now and smelling faintly of lavender from the rinse Agatha had worked through with slow fingers.</p><p>By the time Agatha slipped into the room, the fire had burned low, painting the walls with a warm, uneven glow. Rio was already under the blankets, long body relaxed in a way that invited Agatha in without words.</p><p>She climbed into bed and immediately found herself gathered close, Rio’s arm curving around her like it had always known the shape of her. Agatha pressed her cheek to the steady rise of Rio’s chest, letting the rhythm of her heartbeat fill the quiet between them.</p><p>For a long moment she just breathed there, fingers tracing idle shapes over Rio’s ribs, memorising the warmth, the solidity, the truth of her.</p><p>When she finally spoke, her voice was soft but certain. “You are the most extraordinary thing that has ever happened to me.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze found hers in the dim light, and Agatha’s next words came like a vow. “I love you. Not in the way I’ve loved before—this is… deeper. Wilder. Like something I’ve waited my whole life to find, and only just now have the sense to keep.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed slightly, as if catching pieces of the meaning without holding all of them. But her arm tightened, pulling Agatha closer, forehead pressing gently to hers.</p><p>The words might not land the way they would with others—but the feeling did. Agatha could feel it in the way Rio’s hand rested at the small of her back, in the way her breath deepened to match hers, in the silent promise that thrummed between them.</p><p>Agatha smiled faintly, her thumb brushing along the line of Rio’s jaw. “You’re mine,” she whispered, more to herself than anything.</p><p>Outside, the wards held.</p><p>Inside, Agatha lay tangled in the arms of the only soul who had ever made her believe in forever.</p><p>———</p><p><br/>It started as a hum in her blood.</p><p>Rio’s eyes opened, slow and sharp in the dark. Her breath stayed even. Her ears twitched toward the window. The hearth in the cottage crackled once, low and lazy.</p><p>But the trees were no longer asleep.</p><p>Something was moving.</p><p>Something was watching.</p><p>Agatha lay curled beside her, one arm draped across Rio’s waist, lips parted softly in sleep. Rio looked at her for a long moment, then touched her cheek—just once, gently.</p><p>She didn’t wake her.</p><p>She rose from the bed without a sound.</p><p>Naked feet padded across the floor. She was halfway out the door when she heard it—</p><p>A scream—high, sharp, and so full of terror it split the night wide open.</p><p>Rio froze, ears snapping toward the sound.</p><p>Then she recognised it.</p><p><strong>Cora</strong>.</p><p>The recognition hit like a hook behind her ribs, yanking her forward.</p><p>Rio was through the door before the echo had faded, the cold slamming against her bare skin as she broke into a run.</p><p>The wind carried a scent she didn’t know but recognised.</p><p>Ash. Bone. <em>Old blood</em>.</p><p>She moved fast, past the garden, into the trees.</p><p>The deeper she went, the less sound the forest made. Even the insects had vanished.</p><p>The wardline hummed as she passed, cracked and faintly glowing—but not broken. Not yet.</p><p>Rio crouched. The scent was stronger here. Her lips curled back from her teeth.</p><p>She didn’t speak. She <em>growled</em>.</p><p>A small figure stepped into the clearing, backlit by thin moonlight.</p><p>Cora.</p><p>Her knees were muddy, her braids askew, but she was standing, unharmed.</p><p>Rio straightened, the growl slipping into a low whine as she took a step forward.</p><p>Cora’s smile spread slowly. Too slowly.</p><p>Her small frame blurred, twisted—growing taller, shoulders stretching, limbs lengthening into something wrong. Flesh paled. Eyes blackened. Blood dripped from a mouth now too sharp, too wide.</p><p>The girl was gone.</p><p>In her place stood a hooded witch, her lips and chin smeared with crimson, a cruel grin splitting her face.</p><p>Two more stepped from the pines behind her—eyes bright with hunger, teeth glistening, laughter spilling like rot.</p><p>One held something in its hands.</p><p>Metal.</p><p>It glinted green.</p><p>A collar, wrought from the same iron that had once been wrapped around her neck for years—but alive this time with binding magic, runes humming low, designed not to tame but to strip.</p><p>Behind it, shackles floated in the air—two for her wrists, two for her ankles.</p><p>Rio’s snarl tore through the clearing. She stepped back.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>From beneath the moss and leaves, old magic surged upward—ropes of glowing root and chain, coiled tight with runes that pulsed in time with her heartbeat. They snapped around her limbs before she could leap away.</p><p>She thrashed. Kicked. Clawed.</p><p>The witches only laughed.</p><p>The collar hovered—then slammed onto her neck.</p><p>The moment the metal touched her skin, it latched. Seared. Burned with ancient green fire.</p><p>She howled—not in pain, but in fury.</p><p>The shackles clamped tight around her wrists and ankles. And the world tipped.</p><p>Her vision blurred. Her muscles locked.</p><p>The collar didn’t suppress her wolf.</p><p>It severed it.</p><p>Her connection to the instinct—gone. Like a limb hacked off.</p><p>She fell to her knees, chest heaving, teeth bared.</p><p>The witch who had worn Cora’s face leaned close, her breath cold against Rio’s ear.</p><p>“You were never free,” she whispered, her voice sweet as poison. “Only <em>misplaced</em>.”</p><p>Rio lunged.</p><p>But her body betrayed her.</p><p>And the world went <strong>black</strong>.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>The first thing Agatha felt was cold.</p><p>Not the kind from the morning breeze—but from the absence of warmth beside her.</p><p>Her hand reached out, blindly, to the space where Rio had been.</p><p>Only rumpled sheets.</p><p>Still warm. Not long gone.</p><p>She sat up fast.</p><p>The hearth still glowed faintly. The door—</p><p>
<em>Open.</em>
</p><p>Just an inch.</p><p>The wind whispered through it.</p><p>Then she remembered.</p><p>
<em>The scream.</em>
</p><p>It had dragged her from sleep just moments earlier—high and sharp enough to jolt her upright. She’d thought it was part of a dream, a fragment of some half-forgotten nightmare. But now, with the empty bed and the open door, she knew better.</p><p>Agatha was on her feet before she even realised she’d moved. She yanked on her robe, barely remembered to grab her satchel, and ran outside barefoot into the dark.</p><p>The clearing was still.</p><p>But her wards were humming.</p><p>The token Wanda had left on the table—meant to ward off outside magic—had gone dark. A faint scorch mark blackened the table beneath it.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped.</p><p>She reached for the outer boundary.</p><p>A searing pain flashed in her palm.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>Her magic, when it touched the wardline, came back <strong>screaming</strong>.</p><p>“Rio,” she breathed, already running.</p><p>The trees pressed in.</p><p>She followed instinct, not light—toward the north line. Toward the broken circle. Toward the last place the world had bled.</p><p>And when she stumbled into the clearing—</p><p>Wanda was already there.</p><p>She stood in the centre, red shawl snapping in the rising wind, hair loose around her shoulders, hands glowing faintly.</p><p>Her eyes were closed.</p><p>Listening.</p><p>“Where is she?” Agatha demanded, voice wild, broken.</p><p>Wanda opened her eyes.</p><p>“They took her.”</p><p>Agatha’s knees nearly gave.</p><p>“No—no, I would’ve felt—”</p><p>“You did,” Wanda said gently. “That scream you heard—it was the lure. The moment Rio crossed the wards, I felt the breach. Something pulled her out, Agatha—something she couldn’t ignore.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice cracked. “The scream was Cora’s.”</p><p>Wanda’s gaze was grim. “Not Cora. The Queen of the Crag sent her witches. They couldn’t step into your circle, so they made her come to them. I felt them the instant they crossed the treeline.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “She didn’t cry out.”</p><p>“She didn’t have to.”</p><p>Wanda stepped toward the scorched moss.</p><p>She touched the earth.</p><p>“Old collar magic. New forge. They waited for her to leave your protection. And when she did—they struck. Shackles. Runes. Magic meant to sever her wolf from her blood.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “She went out to protect me.”</p><p>“They were ready for her,” Wanda said. “I felt the chains lock. I came the moment it happened, but they were already gone. The Queen wants her back, Agatha—she sent hunters who know exactly how to take her.”</p><p>Agatha crouched near the earth where the grass had burned. She touched it with trembling fingers.</p><p>“She’s strong,” she whispered. “Stronger than anything they remember.”</p><p>“She is,” Wanda agreed. “But they were prepared this time.”</p><p>Agatha’s head lifted.</p><p>Wanda looked at her.</p><p>“There’s only one place they’d take something that dangerous.”</p><p>Agatha rose to her feet.</p><p>Wanda said the word like an old curse:</p><p>“<strong>Elandrel</strong>.”</p><p>The Witch-Prison. Built before language. Sealed with the bones of queens. A place not even gods walk free.</p><p>Agatha’s voice was steel now.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Then we’re going to burn it down.”<br/>⸻</p>

<p> </p><p>She woke to the sound of dripping water.</p><p>And chains.</p><p>The air was cold—not just from the stone around her, but from the magic that hummed through the walls. Old magic. The kind that didn’t whisper, but watched. It pressed down on her skin like wet cloth.</p><p>Her arms ached first.</p><p>Wrists bound above her head.</p><p>Then ankles. Shackled wide, fixed to the floor.</p><p>Her muscles screamed as she shifted.</p><p>But the worst part was the <strong>collar</strong>.</p><p>New.</p><p>Smooth.</p><p>Alive.</p><p>It pulsed faintly at her throat, a low rhythm that matched her heartbeat, as if feeding from it. Not the searing burn of the first collar. This one was colder. Smarter.</p><p>It didn’t just hold her body.</p><p>It reached into her instincts—and dulled them. </p><p>Her memories became hazy.</p><p>She couldn’t scent the room properly. Couldn’t hear beyond the walls. Her wolf wasn’t gone. But it was muffled. Like she was underwater.</p><p>And beneath that fog, she could feel it working deeper— picking at her mind, prying at the seams of memory. The collar pressed harder whenever her thoughts strayed towards warmth,, toward safety.</p><p>Toward <em>Agatha</em>.</p><p>It wanted to smother the name, to scrub away the good that had been stitched back together. To undo every trace of her witch.</p><p>Rio opened her eyes.</p><p>The chamber was round. Smooth-walled. No windows. Lit only by a single ring of pale green glyphs at the ceiling—like a moon she couldn’t reach.</p><p>She tugged on her chains.</p><p>They didn’t budge.</p><p>She snarled, low and hoarse, and yanked harder.</p><p>The rune beneath her left foot flared.</p><p>Pain shot through her calf.</p><p>She slumped back against the wall, breath harsh.</p><p>But her mind—</p><p>It didn’t break.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>She remembered the way Agatha looked when she slept.</p><p>The way she said the word <em>safe</em>.</p><p>She repeated it under her breath, once.</p><p><em>Safe</em>.</p><p>Then again.</p><p><em>Safe</em>.</p><p>Her voice cracked the third time, lips trembling.</p><p>But the collar didn’t react.</p><p>It didn’t recognise the word.</p><p>It wasn’t meant to.</p><p>She bared her teeth and leaned her head back, whispering into the dark, “Agatha, come.”</p><p>And the walls around her trembled—not from her voice, but from the truth of it.</p><p>She <em>would</em>.</p><p>Agatha would come.</p><p>And the people who built this place would learn what it meant to steal a wolf from her witch.</p><p>⸻</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood at the centre of the archive’s lower sanctum, her palms flat against a weathered map etched into obsidian. The glyphs were faint, their light flickering in response to her pulse. Across the stone, a singular sigil glowed steadily—<strong>Elandre</strong>l—located beyond Salem’s northernmst ley fractures, accessible only through what the old texts described as a transit fault, bound by bloodline and barter.</p><p>Her jaw locked. Even the shape of the word made her chest tighten. The old writings spoke of Elandrel as if it were a wound in the world— an unhealing gash that swallowed the living and spat out shells. </p><p><br/>Wanda observed in silence, her presence a steady counterweight to the jagged thoughts battering Agatha’s mind.</p><p>“This wasn’t made for escape,” Agatha said finally, her voice stripped of all pretence, all hope of denial. “There are no return markers. Only intake.”</p><p>Wanda’s nod was slow. “It’s geometry was carved to contain not just bodies—but identities. Inside long enough, memory degrades. Time stalls. Language falters.”</p><p>The words hit like stones dropped into deep water, each one dragging her further down. Agatha’s fingers tightened against the obsidian. She pictured Rio in there— her bright instincts dulled, her wild edges sanded away by design, until she was no one at all. The thought made something sharp bloom in her throat.</p><p> “She’s strong,” Agatha said, though it felty like she was trying to convince the air itself. “But if they sever the last of her instincts—”</p><p>“They won’t,” Wanda interrupted voice calm but firm. “Not if we move now.”</p><p><em>Not if.</em> Agatha hated the condition in that promise. <br/>Hate was easier than the fear clawing through her ribs. She stepped back from the table, forcing her mind into motion. “We’ll need more than velocity.”</p><p>Wanda crossed to a shelf built into the stone wall. Her hand hovered over several relics—none ordinary. She selected two: a witch’s seal bound in raven bone, and a coiled length of crimson thread used in pact rites. </p><p>“These will open the gate. But once through, protection will fall. You must be prepared to navigate Elandrel without anchor.”</p><p>Agatha took the thread into her palm. It felt warmer than it should have, and the magic in it thrummed with something achingly familiar. “This is blood-tethered.”</p><p>“To her,” Wanda confirmed. “As long as she remembers you, it will guide you toward her cell. But it cannot shield you from the ward traps.”</p><p>Her thumb pressed into the crimson coil, willing herself to feel the faint pulse of Rio’s life along it. She imagined Rio’s eyes— sharp, dark, unbroken. She imagined the way they would dim if too much time passed.</p><p>Agatha drew in a breath that trembled more than she wanted. “Then I’ll rely on her memory.”</p><p>Wanda hesitated, her gaze lingering on the glyphs. “Agatha… you should know. The text dont agree on what Elandrel holds. Some call them guardians. Others call them remnants— things half born, half forgotten. Whatever they are, they don’t answer to any law but the Crag Queen and Elandrel itself.”</p><p>The thought of faceless horrors waiting in that wound of a realm didn’t stir fear in her so much as fury. Let them come. They would learn what it meant to stand between her and Rio.</p><p>Agatha nodded once. “Understood.”</p><p><br/>Wanda lit the outer glyphs, their light catching on the hollows of Agatha’s face. “This isn’t rescue,” she said. “It’s war.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch. Her voice was quiet, but it carried the weight of an oath.</p><p>“She’s worth it.”</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>The cell lit before the door opened.</p><p>A dull, green shimmer bled down the stone walls—glyphs waking like old scars across a body that never healed. The air grew colder. Heavier. Not from cold, but from intent.</p><p>Rio didn’t flinch.</p><p>She sat where they’d left her: shackled to the wall, the new collar humming low, silver cuffs digging into her wrists and ankles. Her muscles ached, her throat was dry, but her eyes… her eyes were steady.</p><p>Golden brown, still.</p><p>Unbroken.</p><p>The door didn’t open like a door.</p><p>It peeled back, stone folding in on itself.</p><p>A woman stepped through.</p><p>Towering—nearly ten feet tall, crowned in jagged silver. Her gown of flowing ivory fell in heavy pleats to the floor, the fabric whispering with each step. Long gloves sheathed her arms, but they could not hide the weapons she bore: talons, a foot long each, black as volcanic glass and honed to a killing edge. They caught the green light like curved blades, every slow flex releasing the faint, deliberate sound of scraping metal.</p><p>Her beauty was carved from cruelty—aristocratic, flawless, but wrong, like marble with veins of something alive writhing just beneath. Her eyes were cold as the crags in winter, but there was something else there too. A hunger. A memory. And, faintly, a bruise of hurt. </p><p>She moved with the patience of a predator that knows its prey has nowhere left to run.</p><p>“Do you know where you are?” she asked softly, as if speaking to a frightened animal.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer.</p><p>The Queen began to circle, one talon dragging lazily along the wall. Stone hissed and split under its touch.</p><p>“This is Elandrel. A place for what cannot be left alive, but must not be allowed to die.”</p><p>She paused.</p><p>“You’ve been here before.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tensed.</p><p>The Queen’s smile was faint, brittle at the edges. “You dont remember.” She tilted her head, studying her like a painting that had been ruined. “Thats… disappointing. The collar works <em>too</em> well.”</p><p>Rio lifted her head slowly. Her lip curled. A soft growl buzzed in her throat.</p><p>But she didn’t speak.</p><p>She couldn’t—not fully.</p><p>Her mind was still wrapped in cotton and shadow, her senses dulled by the binding.</p><p>The Queen crouched in front of her, talons resting lightly on the stone floor between them. Each point left a smoking pinhole in the rock.</p><p>“You were <em>mine</em>, once,” she said, voice dipping lower, almost wistful despite the steel beneath. <br/>“A god of the hunt, made for war.” Her gaze slid down Rio’s body with slow, proprietary hunger. “You slept at my side. Warmed my bed when the moon was full. We painted the mountains red together.” Her eyes softened, just for a moment, with something like nostalgia.</p><p>Her voice sharpened.</p><p>“And then, centuries ago, you were stolen—spirited away by a little gypsy witch who thought she could hide you. Thought she could make you<em> tame</em>.” The word dripped with distain. </p><p><br/>“She dulled your claws. Locked you up until you forgot the taste of blood.”</p><p>She leaned in, her eyes searching Rio’s face for any flicker of recognition, of the feral devotion she once commanded. “And you stayed her pet until she died.” </p><p>The Queen’s smile curved upward again, but it didn’t reach her eyes.</p><p>“And then—fate’s little joke—another witch found you. This one softer still.” Her gaze darkened, talons flexing. “Does she keep you warm, little wolf? Feed you scraps and call that love? Does she think the leash around your neck means you are hers?”</p><p>She gave a slow shake of her head. “I look at you now and see only the shell. No rage in your eyes. No hunger in your bones. Just the ghost of the beast I knew.”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>Her voice dropped, quiet but certain. </p><p>“We will burn her name from your tongue. We will strip away the leash. And when the spell is gone, you will remember how it felt to be mine.”</p><p>Rio’s nostrils flared.</p><p>The Queen reached out—just the curved tip of one talon brushing the collar.</p><p>Rio lunged.</p><p>Her chains snapped taut. Her shoulder wrenched. The glyph on the floor burned red-hot. She screamed through her teeth.</p><p>The Queen didn’t move.</p><p>Didn’t blink.</p><p>Only straightened again, towering over her like a pale obelisk, talons glinting in the green light.</p><p>“You belonged to me before the gypsy witch. Before the soft one. And you will again.” Her voice was lower now, threaded with something unspoken.</p><p>She gestured to the ceiling.</p><p>“To protect the seals. To kill the corrupted. To kneel for the Queen of the Crag.”</p><p>Rio trembled now—not from fear. From fury.</p><p>“And now,” the Queen said, stepping closer, talons grazing the wall beside Rio’s head, “you’ll remember your place. Or we’ll unmake you and start again.”</p><p>Then, softer— almost hesitant.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer.</p><p>But behind her eyes—behind the fog and fire—a name sparked.</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>.</p><p>The Queen’s talon froze mid-reach.</p><p>Rio did not lunge this time.</p><p>She only whispered, cracked and low:</p><p>“Mine.”</p><p>The Queen stilled.</p><p>Her perfect face flickered— disbelief, then a wound she refused to show.</p><p>And Rio smiled.</p><p>With blood in her mouth.</p><p>⸻</p><p> </p><p>The air inside the sanctum thickened as the last rune ignited.</p><p>Wanda stood steady at the western edge of the blood circle, eyes closed, breath measured, her brow furrowed in deep concentration. </p><p>A faint crease had formed between her brows, her lips pressed together as though holding back the strain that shimmered along her fingers. In her mind, there was only one path forward— no room for failure. If they didn’t reach Rio first, the Queen of the Crag would have her weapon, and Salem would burn.</p><p><br/> Agatha knelt at the centre, her palm bleeding into the thread that tethered her to Rio. Her jaw was tight, her mouth a thin line, but her eyes— sharp and glass-bright— were fixed on the faint red glow curling like a living thing across the stone, it pulsed once—</p><p>Then again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>Each beat seemed to strike her chest directly, each thrum proof that Rio was still somewhere beyond reach, still resisting the collar, still herself. Yet beneath that hope was terror, raw and biting, that each pulse could be the last. That the next might come fainter, or not at all.</p><p>Agatha gripped it tighter, her knuckles whitening. </p><p>“She’s still connected,” she whispered, and for a moment her voice caught. The words tasted like prayer, like defiance against inevitability. Her eyes flicked upward, bright with a fragile, defiant hope. “She still remembers me.”</p><p>The thought of Rio forgetting— the wolf who had looked at her once with such unshakable certainty— made Agatha’s stomach twist as if something inside her were breaking. If Rio’s memory was taken, then what was left for either of them? What was left for <em>her</em>?</p><p>Wanda opened her eyes, the lines at the corners deepening. She nodded once, brisk, and unfurled a scroll from her satchel—its surface crawling faintly with ash-and-bone script. Her jaw was set in grim resolve, but her gaze softened when it swept over Agatha, just for a heartbeat.</p><p>“We’ll have one chance. Once the breach opens, we go. No pause. No hesitation. If she turns fully, the queen will march her straight to Salem.”</p><p>Agatha rose, her movements precise, almost regal despite the tightness in her throat. Her bones felt like they were humming with fury, her skin stretched thin over the sheer need clawing through her chest. She could not— would not— lose her.</p><p>Her voice was steady, but her eyes burned.</p><p>“I don’t need a second chance.”</p><p>The outer ring of the circle shattered—not loudly, but like ice cracking beneath a footstep. Wanda’s mouth parted slightly, her gaze snapping to the runes as the ground beneath them groaned. The air turned green, then violet, then black.</p><p>A wind that wasn’t wind passed through them.</p><p>The stone fell away.</p><p>And they <strong>fell with it.</strong></p><p>No motion.</p><p>No sound.</p><p>Only the snap of separation—from the world they knew, from the rules that governed time and magic and space. Elandrel didn’t <em>receive</em> them. It <strong>absorbed</strong> them. Like something that had been hungry.</p><p>Agatha landed first.</p><p>Not hard.</p><p>But wrong.</p><p>The ground beneath her was neither earth nor stone, but a lattice of pulsing runes etched into something that felt like bone and glowed like sickness. Her lips parted faintly, a flicker of unease tightening the corners of her eyes. For a moment she wanted to recoil, but she forced her boots down, forced herself steady. If this place meant to unmake her, it would learn how stubborn a witch could be. </p><p>Her boots stuck for a moment, then pulled free with effort.</p><p>Wanda appeared behind her in a shimmer of red cloth, her face pale but her expression razor sharp. Her eyes swept the corridor ahead, already mapping the fastest way to Rio, already planning how to break the Queen’s hold before Salem’s fate was sealed.</p><p>Agatha meanwhile, could only feel the tether in her hand thrumming faintly against her palm like a second heartbeat. She clutched it until her hand trembled, forcing her mind to hold the truth of it; Rio still remembers.</p><p>Neither spoke.</p><p>They stepped forward into the narrow corridor that yawned ahead, flanked by dead walls and watchful glyphs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Far below, in a cell carved from bone and shadow, Rio’s golden eyes opened.</p><p>Her breath came ragged, her lips shaping something— half a word, half a name. The sound barely formed, but the tether in Agatha’s hand pulsed sharp and bright, as if her Wolff had reached across the dark and nearly touched her.</p><p>Rio tried again, teeth catching her lip, eyes straining against the haze in her mind. She could see the curve of a face, the warmth of a hand, the cadence of a voice that once steadied her. Agatha. The syllables almost surfaced—</p><p>— and the collar at her throat answered. It pulsed—once, twice—before pouring a surge of green fire into her spine.</p><p>The tether in Agatha’s hand spasmed.</p><p>Then… went dull.</p><p>The faint pulse she had felt through the thread—steady and warm—flickered out. Not like a flame snuffed by wind, but like something erased.</p><p>In the cell, Rio’s jaw slackened.</p><p>The recognition in her gaze clouded, gold dimming into a cold, unblinking green.</p><p>The longing in her chest— the fight to remember— collapsed into silence.</p><p>Her breath deepened, slow and even, until there was nothing left in her face but the stillness of an animal awaiting command.</p><p>The runes at her feet flared in unison.</p><p>Her body convulsed, then shifted—not with the bloom of memory, but the snap of control.</p><p>Muscle thickened.</p><p>Bones stretched.</p><p>Her hands clawed the ground as her nails blackened into talons.</p><p>Fur poured over her skin like liquid shadow, slick with the green sheen of the collar’s magic.</p><p>She opened her mouth as if to cry a name-- but only a guttural snarl broke free.</p><p>When she lifted her head, the wolf that looked back was not Rio.</p><p>It was a weapon.</p><p>The howl came a moment later—long and resonant, but empty of the wild joy Agatha had once known.  </p><p>Wanda’s head turned sharply toward the sound, her eyes narrowing in cold recognition. This was the sound she had feared— the signal that Salems’s greatest threat had just taken form. </p><p>Agatha froze in the corridor, her breath catching, the echo running cold along her spine. Her face was drawn, stricken— shoulders rigid as if bracing against a blow.</p><p>Her fingers clenched around the useless tether until blood welled fresh from her palm.</p><p>Wanda’s gaze darted to her, her mouth a tight, urgent line. “Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was raw, barely more than a breath.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s gone.”</p><p>The howl rose again, closer this time, and Agatha’s composure cracked— just slightly, enough for the grief to bleed through.</p><p>Wanda’s jaw set like iron. “Then we get her back before the Queen reaches Salem.”</p><p>Somewhere ahead, the Queen of the Crag had her wolf.</p><p>And Rio no longer knew her name.</p><p><br/>⸻</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>The corridor narrowed until the walls pressed in, slick with the sheen of rune-light. Ahead, the passage opened into a jagged archway that bled a cold green glow into the tunnel.</p><p>Elandrel’s gate.</p><p>And the thing that guarded it.</p><p>It crouched in the threshold like a spider too big for the world — six legs of obsidian bone ending in hooked talons that bit into the stone. Its body was a warped mass of plates and sinew, each seam glowing with the same sick green that pulsed through the Queen’s magic. A head like a crownless helm turned toward them, eyeless but somehow still seeing, its mouth a vertical split of teeth that breathed rot into the air.</p><p>The sound it made was wrong — not a roar, not a hiss, but something between metal screaming and stone grinding.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, her sharp blue eyes narrowing as the monster unfolded to its full height. “Charming,” she murmured, her voice thin with contempt. “Your friends do have a taste for the grotesque.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t take her eyes off it. “It’s not just a guard. It’s bound to the gate. The moment it dies, the seal weakens.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved in a dangerous smile. “Then we kill it quickly.”</p><p>The monster lunged, the impact shattering the stones beneath their feet.</p><p>Wanda’s hands came up in a flare of scarlet, her magic snapping into a shield that caught the brunt of the strike — but the force still drove her back several steps. Her eyes narrowed, fingers curling, twisting the shield into a sphere that trapped two of the monster’s legs.</p><p>Agatha moved in the same breath, her own magic flaring black-violet, a crackle of frost along the edges as she struck the creature’s flank.</p><p>The spell sliced deep — not flesh, but the magic woven into its bones — and the thing shrieked, the sound vibrating in their ribs.</p><p>It thrashed, tearing free from Wanda’s hold, and swung a talon toward Agatha’s head.</p><p>She dropped low, the air above her crown hissing as the claw passed. Her coat flared as she spun, pressing her palm to the floor; black fire rippled along the runes in the stone, coiling up the monster’s legs like serpents.</p><p>“Now!” she barked.</p><p>Wanda’s scarlet energy slammed into the monster’s chest, a twisting knot of raw chaos magic that burned through plate and bone in an instant. The guard convulsed, its scream splintering into a high-pitched keening before the green light in its body guttered and went out.</p><p>It fell — not to the floor, but into itself, collapsing into a heap of crumbling black shards that turned to dust before they hit the ground.</p><p>Silence rushed in, broken only by the hiss of the weakening gate ahead.</p><p>Agatha rose slowly, her hand still faintly bleeding from the tether earlier, her eyes sharp and cold. “You could have told me it would scream like that.”</p><p>Wanda’s mouth twitched, but her gaze was already on the archway. “You’ll live. Now move. The Queen will know we’re here.”</p><p>They stepped over the scattering of black ash and through the arch, the air beyond colder still — </p><p><br/>and somewhere in the depths, a wolf howled, closer than before.</p><p><br/>The entrance corridor warped as they moved.</p><p>Ceiling too low. Floor too slick. The walls changed—one moment lined with ash-carved symbols, the next breathing like flesh. </p><p>Elandrel wasn’t meant to be traversed. It was meant to <em>consume</em>.</p><p>The corridor bristled with snares disguised as architecture. Runes shifted into spirals, baiting the eye; one glance too long, and the mind would unravel into endless recursion. Spikes of bone flickered in and out of solidity, eager to pierce a carless step. A shimmer of water pooled across the floor— not water at all, but memory lures, each ripple tugging at the mind with a voice that wasn’t theirs. </p><p>Wanda kept ahead, her red magic flaring dim, threads weaving like a seamstress undoing stitches. She unraveled a spiral rune with a flick of her wrist, threads of scarlet cutting through its loops before it could catch Agatha’s gaze. She drew her hand over the bone spikes, collapsing them into dust with a soft hiss. At the water trap, she bent low, fingertips brushing the air until the false surface split open, hissing back into nothing. </p><p>Her movements were clinical, swift, but Agatha could see the strain in the sharpness of her beath, the tightness of her shoulders. Every undone trap was another piece of  Wanda burned away, another sliver of power spent.</p><p>Her mind ticked with precision. Each snuffed trap was another step closer to Rio— and one less chance for the Queen to arm herself with Salem’s ruin. There was no time to waste. No room for hesitation. </p><p>Agatha followed tightly behind, the blood-thread coiled in her bleeding palm now nothing more than a useless length of red. Its pulse had gone hours— or was it minutes?— ago. She still gripped it hard enough to sting, refusing to drop it. <em>If she cant feel me, I’ll damn well make sure I get close enough she will</em>.</p><p>“She’s close,” Agatha murmurs, though she couldnt be certain. It was less truth than vow. “She has to be.”</p><p>The first shapes came from the darkness ahead—shaggy, hulking, the stink of wet fur and blood heavy in the air. </p><p><strong>Lycans</strong>. </p><p>Their claws scraped the warped stone, teeth bared in snarls that steamed in the cold air.</p><p><em>Finally</em>, Agatha thought, lips twitching faintly. <em>Something to burn.</em> </p><p>Wanda’s hands flared crimson. A twist of her fingers sent a blast down the corridor, shattering the first wave into bone and ash. <em>Good— clear the path</em>. </p><p>Agatha moved through the wreckage without slowing, violet magic snapping from her fingertips in searing arcs that flayed the next creature mid-leap. Her spells landed with more force than finesse, fed by a low, sharp burn under her ribs.</p><p>Then came the laughter.</p><p>Soft. Female.</p><p>It slithered along the walls.</p><p>From the shadows ahead, three figures emerged—hooded, their lips and chins wet with blood, necklaces of bone rattling faintly against their black robes. The air warped around them as if reality itself recoiled.</p><p>The witches.</p><p>Agatha knew them by reputation—sisters who fed on the marrow of the living and wove hexes from screams. <em>Of course</em>, she thought, her voice curling into her own head. <em>The Queen does love her theatrics.</em></p><p>“You won’t take her,” Agatha said, her voice low and sure, each word cutting clean.</p><p>They only smiled.</p><p>The first raised her hand—black nails curving like talons—and the corridor behind them sealed with living flesh. The second whispered a curse that made the torches flicker green. The third simply looked at Wanda and licked her lips.</p><p>Wanda moved first. Her magic bloomed red and violent, smashing the wall of flesh to pulp and dragging the nearest witch off her feet. The woman’s scream turned into a hiss before she dissolved into a cloud of biting, chittering insects.</p><p><em>One down</em>.</p><p>The lycans came again—pouring from the cracks in the walls, claws scrabbling, eyes glowing.</p><p>Agatha’s magic erupted in a shockwave of violet fire, not guided by the warmth of connection but by the hollow ache of its absence. <em>She doesn’t know me. Then I’ll make them all remember who I am</em>.</p><p>Every blast tore through fur and bone, each spell hitting harder than the last.</p><p><br/>Beside her, Wanda was a storm— scarlet chains whipping through the air, crushing skills, binding limbs until they snapped. She countered curses mid-incantation, ripping the heart from the second witch with a single pull of her hand. </p><p><br/>The last witch shrieked and hurled herself forward—jaws splitting too wide, teeth too long. </p><p>Agatha met her mid-air, catching her by the throat. “Ive had worse dates,” she murmured, before her magic burning through the woman’s flesh until she turned to dust between her fingers.</p><p>The corridor fell still.</p><p>Only their breathing remained.</p><p>Agatha wiped her hands on her coat, eyes still alight with violet fire. She didn’t glance at Wanda as she strode forward. </p><p>She wasn’t thinking.</p><p>She was burning.</p><p>“I’m coming,” she whispered, over and over like a mantra. “I’m coming, I’m coming—”</p><p>And far ahead—</p><p>Echoing back through twisting stone—</p><p>A deep, rolling cackle.</p><p>It wasn’t just sound—it scraped down the spine, curling in the gut, vibrating the runes under their feet. The laugh seemed to come from everywhere at once, swelling until the walls themselves shuddered.</p><p>Wanda’s magic flared instinctively, her stance shifting. “She knows we’re here.”</p><p>Agatha’s grip on the blood-thread tightened, her knuckles bone-white. “Good.”</p><p>The corridor stretched forward into a vaulted chamber. Its walls were carved with jagged glyphs that bled faint green light. A throne of blackened bone rose at the far end—</p><p>—and beside it, towering, monstrous, and gleaming with magic—</p><p> </p><p><strong>Rio</strong>.</p><p> </p><p>Not the Rio Agatha knew.</p><p>Her chest tightened, air catching somewhere too high in her lungs. Every detail struck like a blow— the slope of her back now alien under the heavy fur, the curve of her muzzle strained with a sheen that wasn’t her own. The silver shot back of her coat had been swallowed by the sickly green shimmer from the collar locked at her throat.</p><p>Her frame was much larger, heavier, the muscles in her shoulders bunched like a predator ready to spring.<br/>And her eyes—once golden brown, full of warmth and mischief—were two perfect, unblinking emeralds.</p><p>Cold.</p><p>Empty. </p><p>Beside Agatha, Wanda’s pace faltered for the briefest heartbeat. The fear was there in her eyes, sharp and calculating all at once. She didn’t need to speak for Agatha to feel it, <em>we might be too late. </em></p><p>Rio stood nearly shoulder-to-shoulder with the Queen herself, every line of her body tense, lips peeled back in a snarl that rattled the air. </p><p>The Queen of the Crag emerged from behind her wolf,  towering above them, talons glinting in the green flames, the sweep of her gown flowing like liquid shadow. </p><p>Her voice was a purr that carried across the chamber with predatory ease.</p><p>“You’ve come to reclaim what’s mine,” she said, her gaze lingering on Agatha with amusement and hunger. “My wolf. My blade. My beloved pet.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled at her sides until her nails bit into her palms. She had imagined this moment a thousand times— Rio’s face when she saw her, the relief, the recognition. Not this. Never this.</p><p>She stroked her talons lightly down Rio’s flank. The great wolf’s tail flicked, her snarl deepening.</p><p>“With her at my side, I will grind your little Salem into the earth. Every ward will fall. Every witch will kneel. And you—” her eyes glinted, “—will watch her teeth tear through your throat.”</p><p>Wanda’s hands flexed at her sides, scarlet magic humming faintly, not yet flaring— she was measuring distances, angles, consequences. But under that calculation, her pulse beat hard; <em>if she gives the command ,we may not be able to stop her in time. </em></p><p>Rio growled low, the sound promising blood, her gaze locked on Agatha and waiting—poised—for the single command that would unleash her.</p><p>Agatha stepped forward, unflinching, though every inch of her wanted to run to Rio, to tear that collar from her neck with her bare hands.  “No. She would never harm me.”</p><p>The Queen’s smile curved. “Oh? She doesn’t even remember your name. She hears only mine.”</p><p>The words slid under Agatha’s ribs like a blade. But she didn’t falter. She forced her voice to carry, sharp and steady, even as grief burned hot at the back of her throat.</p><p>“Memory is nothing compared to truth. And the truth is—my love for her is stronger than your chains, stronger than your curses, stronger than the centuries you kept her in darkness.”</p><p>Wanda’s gaze flicked sharply to Agatha, her posture tense, mind racing. <em>If she can reach her, if there’s even a sliver of the girl left</em>…</p><p>Agatha kept going, eyes locked on Rio. She willed those green eyes to see her, to remember. “You can bind her body, twist her mind, flood her with your poison—but you will never touch the part of her that is mine. You can call yourself her queen, her master, her creator, but she is not yours.”</p><p>The Queen tilted her head, her grin widening as if savouring the challenge.</p><p>“She is mine,” Agatha finished, her voice low and fierce, aching with love and fury. “And I will burn this prison to the ground before I let you keep her.”</p><p>For a heartbeat, nothing moved. The only sound was the low, steady grown in Rio’s chest, and the pounding in Wanda’s ears.</p><p>Rio’s snarl sharpened. Her claws scraped the stone.</p><p>And somewhere beneath the green, deep in those wolf’s eyes—something shifted.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught so subtly she doubted anyone noticed, but the flicker in her chest was immediate and brutal. <em>She’s still in there. She has to be</em>. The thought was a blade she clung to, even as the rest of her screamed that the green in those eyes was swallowing everything she loved. </p><p>For a heartbeat, nothing moved.</p><p>Rio’s snarl cut through the thick, green-lit air, her claws biting into the bone-laid floor. The sound echoed off the chamber walls like distant thunder. Agatha felt it in her ribs, in the ache of her palms where nails dug deep.</p><p>The Queen’s eyes narrowed, and her smile deepened into something almost fond. “Look at her,” she purred. “Every inch the god I made her to be. Do you see the way she watches you? Like prey. She remembers your face only as something to tear.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse stung at her temples. The wolf’s gaze felt like knives, but she refused to look away. “ she remembers more than you think,” she said evenly, though her voice was a thread pulled tight. </p><p>The Queen gave a low, velvety laugh. “You tell yourself that to keep from breaking. I’ve seen it a thousand times—wives, lovers, masters—standing exactly where you are, whispering that their bond is stronger than my will. They all bled the same in the end.”</p><p>A whisper of fear slid under Agatha’s ribs, cold and unwelcome, but she locked her jaw against it.<br/>“She’s not one of your thousand,” she replied, every word deliberate. </p><p>“You mistake possession for affection,” the Queen countered. “You think your touch, your bed, your little words of comfort can compete with what we shared? I took her beneath the moon, draped in the skins of our kills. I fed her the hearts of kings. I bathed her in blood until the ground itself sang her name.”</p><p>The words landed like blows, each. Image painted in a colour Agatha wanted to tear from the world. Her jaw tightened until it hurt, but she didn’t look away from Rio. <em>Thats not her. Thats not who she is with me.</em></p><p>“That’s not love. That’s control. You chained her and called it devotion. You broke her and called it worship. I will not.”</p><p>The Queen stepped forward, her talons clinking softly against the bone floor, the great wolf at her side matching her stride. “What will you do, little witch? Speak her name? Call her back with kisses and poetry?” She leaned her head slightly, eyes glittering. “She doesn’t even hear you now. All she hears is my voice.”</p><p>Agatha’s magic flared violet around her hands, heat spilling down her arms  “Then I’ll burn your voice out of her.”</p><p>The Queen’s lips curved into a slow, dangerous grin. “You’ll try. And when you fail, she will tear you apart while I watch.”</p><p>She shifted her attention to Rio, stroking a talon under the wolf’s jaw. “Kill her.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered, not from fear of dying but from the sight of Rio’s body tensing, shoulders rolling forward, the memory of those same muscles wrapped around her in warmth now twisted into a weapon against her. The low growl grew into a rumble that shook the floor.</p><p>Beside her, Wanda’s hand twitched toward her magic, Agatha , without looking, lifted a single hand to stop her—never breaking her stare with the wolf. “Don’t,” she said quietly. “If anyone’s going to reach her, it’s me.”</p><p>Wanda’s gaze cut sideways to her, the fear in her chest sharpening into calculation. <em>If you’re wrong, she’ll kill you before I can intervene</em>. </p><p>The Queen laughed, the sound thick with certainty. “Reach her? She’s gone, little witch. I hollowed her out long before you even knew her name.”</p><p>Agatha took one slow step forward, violet magic flickering brighter around her fingers. Her heart beat so hard she could taste it. “Then I’ll fill her again—with something you can’t touch.”</p><p>The Queen’s eyes narrowed, her smile hardening. “You think love is a weapon?”</p><p>“It’s the only one you can’t defend against.”</p><p>For the first time, the Queen’s grin faltered.</p><p>“Kill her.”</p>

<p><br/>The collar at Rio’s throat flared a violent green, runes racing like wildfire across her fur. Her head lowered, shoulders bunching, claws gouging the bone floor. The growl in her chest deepened until it was a physical thing—pressing against the ribs, vibrating the air.</p><p>Wanda’s magic surged, crackling red between her hands. “Agatha—”</p><p>“Stand down,” Agatha said without looking at her.</p><p>The Queen’s laughter rang through the chamber, rich and sure. “Such bravery, such foolishness. She’ll start with your throat, then your heart. I might even let you die slow, so you have time to see what’s become of her.”</p><p>Rio’s muscles rippled under her fur, her tail lashing once before stilling—every nerve in her body wound tight for the strike.</p><p>“I freed her,” Agatha said, her voice low, certain. “And no curse, no collar, no false queen will ever change that.”</p><p>“She’s <em>mine</em>,” the Queen snarled back, all pretence of elegance gone, her talons curling with anticipation. “And you’re about to watch her prove it.”</p><p>The command came like a whip-crack. “NOW.”</p><p>Rio exploded forward, a blur of muscle and teeth, claws tearing up shards of bone with every stride. Her snarl was thunder, her eyes a killing green, her focus fixed solely on Agatha.</p><p>Wanda’s breath hitched, red magic flaring—but Agatha didn’t move.</p><p>The Queen’s smile spread, ready to savour the kill.</p><p>The wolf closed the distance in a heartbeat.</p><p>And in that heartbeat—Agatha stepped into her path, violet fire flaring in her palms, her voice cutting through the chamber like a blade.</p><p>“<strong>RIO</strong>.”</p><p>The name hit her like a thunderclap.</p><p>It didn’t slow her. Not at first. The great wolf slammed into Agatha with the force of a collapsing wall, claws raking sparks from the violet shield Agatha threw up at the last instant. The impact drove her back several steps, her boots grinding against the bone floor.</p><p>Violet fire flared between them, crackling against the green haze in Rio’s eyes. The wolf’s teeth snapped inches from Agatha’s face, breath hot and laced with the metallic tang of blood.</p><p>“Do it!” the Queen’s voice cracked like a whip from behind, the collar burning brighter, the runes crawling over Rio’s fur like chains alive with malice.</p><p>For a moment, the pressure was overwhelming—Agatha could feel the shield thinning under the wolf’s weight, her muscles straining to hold her ground. Wanda took a step forward, red magic building in her palms, but Agatha barked, “NO!” without taking her eyes off Rio.</p><p>“You don’t want this,” Agatha said through clenched teeth, forcing her voice past the snarl rattling in her ears. “You know me. You’ve always known me.”</p><p>The green light in Rio’s eyes flickered. Just once.</p><p>The Queen’s talons dug into the armrest of her throne, carving deep grooves into the bone. “Finish her!”</p><p>Rio’s head jerked toward the sound of the command, muscles tightening, claws digging deeper into the floor. Her teeth bared again at Agatha—then stilled, hovering.</p><p>Agatha’s magic flared brighter, violet light pouring around her like wildfire. “You’re not her weapon,” she said, voice breaking but fierce. “Please, <em>my love.</em>”</p><p>The growl in Rio’s throat faltered, caught between two masters. The collar’s runes burned, screaming their control into her bones. The Queen shouted another command, voice ringing with fury.</p><p>And then—</p><p>The world jolted sideways.</p><p>The green haze over her vision shuddered, cracked, then surged back twice as strong. The collar’s magic roared through her spine, snarling over the Queen’s voice—<em>kill her, kill her, kill her—</em>but there was something else now. A sound under the sound. A heartbeat under the command.</p><p>Her heartbeat.</p><p>No—<em>Agatha’s</em>.</p><p>It was faint, but it was there, thudding steady and defiant against the chaos.</p><p>And with that heartbeat came light.</p><p>At first, it was only an image, blurred at the edges—pale fingers threading through her hair. Then another—Agatha’s mouth curving in that sharp, private smile, the one she’d never seen on anyone else.</p><p>The collar pulsed, trying to drown it, but the pictures kept coming.</p><p>Agatha standing in the doorway with a cup of tea, steam curling in the morning chill.<br/>Agatha’s voice, low and certain: <em>You’re not dangerous to me.</em><br/>Agatha’s laugh when Rio got the word wrong on purpose, just to hear it again.<br/>The weight of her hand against the back of Rio’s neck, steady as a promise.<br/>The scent of lilac and smoke clinging to her clothes.<br/>The warmth of her sleeping breath against Rio’s chest.</p><p>The Queen’s voice rose, furious, trying to shove the images out—<em>Mine. You are mine</em>.</p><p>But Agatha’s memories came faster now, layering over one another until Rio’s vision wasn’t green at all, but full of violet fire.</p><p>The wild pear tree in the garden.<br/>A crooked daisy tucked behind her ear.<br/>The way Agatha’s eyes softened when she thought Rio wasn’t looking.<br/>The night sky over Salem, Agatha’s hand curled around hers, their shadows long and close.</p><p>The Queen’s grip in her mind faltered.</p><p>And then—</p><p>The first time Agatha said it.</p><p>That one word.</p><p><em>Mine</em>.</p><p>It hit like a crack in stone. The green light shattered. The collar’s magic burned out in an instant, leaving only gold in her eyes and fire in her chest.</p><p>The scent of Agatha filled her lungs. The sound of her voice filled her head.</p><p>And for the first time since she’d been dragged into this place, Rio could breathe.</p><p>The Queen said something—she didn’t hear it.</p><p>She only moved.</p><p>Agatha saw it happen.</p><p>One moment, the wolf’s eyes were a killing green— cold, alien, unrecognisable. And then— like a tear in the fabric of a storm— a spark broke through. Golden brown. The warmth she knew. </p><p>It hit her so suddenly she almost staggered. Her lungs forgot how to work. <em>My love… there you are</em>.<br/>The words rang in her ear, sharp with disbelief and aching with hope.</p><p>Rio’s body snapped toward the throne before thought could catch her. Her claws hit stone hard enough to crack it, bone splinters flying as she launched herself at the Queen.</p><p>The false monarch barely had time to rise before the wolf was on her—teeth closing around her wrist, wrenching until bone popped, claws raking down her chest and scattering black silk into ribbons. The Queen screamed, her voice sharp enough to rattle the cavern walls.</p><p>“You ungrateful beast—!”</p><p>Rio slammed her down into the throne, jaws snapping for her throat. The Queen’s free hand shot up, green fire igniting in her palm. It poured across Rio’s body, searing through fur and flesh, a soundless agony that buckled her limbs. The wolf howled, her body jerking violently, but she did not let go—her teeth sank deeper, until blood ran like ink down her muzzle.</p><p>Agatha’s nails dug into her palms until they broke skin, violet sparks spilling from the wounds. Her throat burned with the need to scream Rio’s name, but all that came out was a strangled whisper. Wanda felt it too— the sharp, frantic jolt of panic in her chest— and her chaos surges, crackling at her fingertips, desperate to strike.</p><p>The Queen’s eyes blazed, her face twisted with fury. “You are MINE.”</p><p>The word was a spell in itself, power cracking out in a vicious wave. The magic tore Rio from her body like a ragdoll, hurling her across the chamber. She struck the wall with a sickening crack and collapsed in a heap, twitching, steam rising from the burned runes still fading at her throat.</p><p>Agatha’s heart stopped. For one beat, there was nothing but silence— no breath, no sound, only the sight of her love broken on the floor.</p><p>Then something inside her snapped.</p><p>Violet flame burst from her in a column that lit the chamber like dawn breaking. Every rune, every sigil she had ever etched into her bones came alive at once, answering the rage in her chest. Her hair whipped in the storm of her own power, her eyes white with fury. Her cry was wordless, half cried, half fury, but it shook the very marrow of the chamber</p><p>Wanda staggered back a step, eyes wide— she had seen Agatha powerful before, but never like this. For a breath, she hesitated, caught between awe and terror, then lifted her hands and drove her magic forward.<br/>Her scarlet threads wrapping around Agatha’s, tangling, amplifying, until the very air shook with it. Red and violet lightning tangled across the ceiling, crawling down the walls like cracks in reality itself. The force of it made Wanda’s teeth grit, blood prickling at the corners of her eyes, but she held on.</p><p>The Queen staggered to her feet, blood slick at her throat, her ruined arm knitting itself with unnatural speed. She sneered, though the edges of her glamour flickered, faltering. “You think you can stand against me?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice dropped, thunderous and steady, carrying through the roar of power around her. “Stand against you? No. I’ll stand over your burnt ashes.”</p><p>Wanda’s mouth twitched at the venom in it— grim, sharp-edged satisfaction even through the fury. Her magic coiled tighter, bolstering Agatha’s vow.</p><p>The chamber convulsed. The two witches moved as one, violet fire and crimson chaos colliding into a single storm that split the air with a sound like the world breaking open. The Queen raised her arms to shield herself, but the blast drove her to her knees, her glamour shattering, the truth of her twisted form laid bare.</p><p>Her crown clattered to the ground, rolling across the bone floor as the walls shuddered.</p><p>Behind them, Rio dragged herself upright. Her body trembled, smoke still rising from her wounds, but her eyes—clear, gold, unbroken—locked onto Agatha.</p><p>Agatha gasped when she saw her standing again, her power faltering for a heartbeat, grief and relief twisting together until Wanda’s magic shoved more strength into her veins. Wanda’s lips parted in astonishment— Rio was still moving, still fighting.</p><p>She bared her teeth. Not at Agatha, not at Wanda.</p><p>At the Queen.</p><p>And this time, nothing stood between her and the kill.</p><p>The Queen staggered, her silks scorched to ash, her skin peeling back in places where Agatha and Wanda’s magic had burned through the lies. What remained was not regal at all, but a gaunt, snarling creature—talons dripping black ichor, her spine twisted into cruel ridges, her eyes glowing sickly green.</p><p>“You think you’ve won?” she spat, her voice distorted, splitting into two, three tones at once. “I am eternal. I am the crown. I AM—”</p><p>She didn’t finish.</p><p>Rio was already moving.</p><p>The wolf exploded from the ground in a blur of muscle and fury, claws digging furrows into the bone floor as she launched herself at the Queen. She struck like a storm breaking, her jaws closing around the Queen’s shoulder, driving her backward into the throne with enough force to splinter it down the middle. Shards of bone clattered across the chamber.</p><p>The Queen shrieked, green fire erupting from her chest and blasting through Rio’s body. The wolf howled, claws gouging deeper, teeth locked tight, refusing to let go even as her fur smoked.</p><p>“Hold her!” Agatha’s voice cracked, carrying over the din.</p><p>Scarlet threads lashed out, Wanda’s magic wrapping around the Queen’s limbs, pinning them wide. The monster writhed, the bones of her arms creaking under the strain as Wanda dragged her down to her knees.</p><p>Agatha stepped forward, violet fire spiralling in both palms, her eyes locked on Rio. “Now, love. Together.”</p><p>At her voice, Rio tore free with a savage twist, ripping a chunk from the Queen’s shoulder. Blood like oil sprayed across the floor. The wolf backed off just far enough to circle, her body trembling but her gaze feral, golden, waiting.</p><p>The Queen roared, slamming her palms against the floor. Green shockwaves burst outward, cracking bone, tearing chunks from the walls. The chamber shook, dust raining down like ash. Wanda braced, chaos magic surging in raw sheets, but even she staggered against the force.</p><p>Agatha’s arms rose high, violet glyphs spinning around her, the language of the ancients burning in the air. “RIO—NOW!”</p><p>The wolf lunged.</p><p>At the same instant, Wanda poured her full strength into the Queen, scarlet chaos tightening like chains, locking her in place.</p><p>And Agatha unleashed everything.</p><p>Violet fire slammed into the Queen’s chest, ripping straight through her glamour, her wards, her lies. It seared into her heart like a brand, burning from the inside out. She shrieked, her body jerking violently against Wanda’s hold.</p><p>Rio hit a heartbeat later. Her teeth found the exposed throat and clamped down. Hard.</p><p>The Queen’s scream turned into a gurgle. Green fire poured from her eyes and mouth, wild, uncontrolled, spraying across the chamber before collapsing inward. Her body twisted, convulsed—then split apart in a violent burst of black ash and light.</p><p>The explosion tore through the throne room, rattling every wall, blowing out the torches in a single rush of wind.</p><p>When the dust settled—</p><p>The Queen was gone.</p><p>Only her shattered crown remained, broken into three jagged pieces scattered across the bone floor.</p><p>Wanda sank to one knee, breathing hard, her hands still smoking red. Agatha staggered forward, her body trembling, her palms blistered and raw where the violet fire had burned through her own skin.</p><p>And Rio—</p><p>Rio stood in the ruins, chest heaving, her muzzle dark with blood and ash, her eyes bright gold in the gloom. She turned, slowly, toward Agatha.</p><p>Not snarling. Not fighting.</p><p>Her ears flattened, a low whine rumbling from her throat, almost apologetic.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. She reached out with shaking fingers, her voice breaking. “Come here, my love.”</p><p>And the wolf did—collapsing into her arms as the chamber walls cracked and crumbled around them.</p><p><br/>Agatha was already at her side, one hand sliding into the thick fur at her neck, the other braced against her shoulder. “Stay with me,” she urged, her voice low but fierce. Her grip tightened— she wasn’t letting go again. </p><p>The wolf huffed, leaning into her, but her breathing was ragged, each inhale a battle. Agatha’s pulse raced. <em>She’s hurt. She’s too tired. We’re running out of time.</em> </p><p>Wanda’s head snapped toward the corridor. “We’ve got company.”</p><p>Dozens of lycans surged into view, their eyes feral without the Queen’s command to leash them. They weren’t disciplined anymore—just furious and hungry. Agatha’s lip curled. “Perfect.”</p><p>Agatha’s magic flared violet in her palms. “We don’t have time for this.” <em>But if they want a fight, they’ll regret asking me</em>. </p><p>Rio took a step forward, lips curling in a snarl, but her front legs buckled under her own weight. She caught herself before collapsing, muscles trembling violently.</p><p>“You can’t fight,” Agatha said sharply, catching her gaze. “You’ve done enough.” Her tone left no room for argument— though she knew Rio would argue if she could. </p><p>“I’ll clear us a path,” Wanda called, her voice already echoing ahead, red magic coiling into glowing whips.</p><p>The first lycan lunged into the chamber. Wanda’s chain caught it midair, yanking it sideways into the wall with a wet crack. She tore through the next two before they could reach striking distance, her movements a blur of precision and fury.</p><p>“Agatha—now!”</p><p>Agatha pressed her hand to Rio’s shoulder. “You stay right next to me. Step for step. Do you hear me?”</p><p>Rio’s head dipped once—barely a nod, but it was enough to squeeze Agatha’s throat with a painful mix of relief and fear.</p><p>They moved. Not fast, but steady. Agatha’s magic lashed out in bursts, violet arcs cutting through any beast that slipped past Wanda’s wall of red. Every time Rio’s legs wavered, Agatha’s hand steadied her, voice murmuring low, grounding her. <em>Don’t fall. Don’t you dare leave me now</em>.</p><p>The corridor groaned around them, sections of ceiling dropping in jagged slabs. The floor pulsed like something alive beneath their feet, the entire prison shuddering as if it knew its queen was gone— and wanted to take them with her. </p><p>Behind them, the throne room collapsed entirely, a deafening roar of stone and bone.</p><p>“Almost there,” Agatha murmured, keeping her voice steady despite her racing pulse. “Just a little further, my love.”</p><p>Wanda blasted open the final stretch, light from the breach spilling into the dark.</p><p>Elandrel screamed—long and low, the sound of something ancient dying. The sound clawed at Agatha’s bones. </p><p>The corridor narrowed ahead, the air thick with dust and the stink of lycan blood.</p><p>They were so close. Agatha could feel the shift in the magic—the faintest tug of open air somewhere ahead—but the prison wasn’t letting them go without a fight.</p><p>The last stretch constricted suddenly, walls bulging inward like muscle contracting. From the ceiling, jagged spines of bone dropped in rapid bursts, forcing Wanda and Agatha back. A pack of lycans slammed into them from both sides, claws raking against Wanda’s shields, snapping jaws inches from Agatha’s face.</p><p>They were pinned.</p><p>“Move!” Wanda shouted, crimson light flaring as she lashed out, but for every beast she dropped, two more pushed in, pressing them tighter against the narrowing walls. The smell of scorched fur and blood thickened the air, choking, clinging to the back of Agatha’s throat.</p><p>Agatha’s magic burned bright and vicious, violet arcs cutting through claws and bone, but the corridor’s shifting bone lashed out— one jagged hook catching her sleeve and wrenching her sideways. She nearly went down. Pain tore up her shoulder. A snarl rose in her throat, half rage, half fear. “We’re not going to make it—”</p><p>Then a shadow fell over them.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>The sight punched the air from Agatha’s lungs. </p><p>The gashes across her flank—deep enough to have shown bone minutes ago—were already sealing shut, her fur matted and slick with fresh blood but knitting with supernatural speed. She was breathing hard, each exhale a heavy gust, but her eyes … her eyes were gold again. No green. No fog. Just the razor sharp focus Agatha knew better than her own reflection. </p><p>Before Agatha could speak, Rio shoved forward into the choke point. Her massive frame became a living wall, plowing through the tangle of attackers, scattering them like dry leaves before a storm. Bone cracked under her weight. Jaws snapped shut on empty air as she bulldozed ahead. Then— suddenly— she turned, planting herself in a deliberate crouch, her body a solid barrier between them and the mob, muscles coiled and waiting. </p><p>Agatha blinked. “She wants us to—”</p><p>“No,” Wanda said immediately, her voice sharp with refusal, shaking her head. “That’s insane.”</p><p>Another wave slammed into the walls, making the entire corridor shudder. One claw slipped through Wanda’s barrier and raked across Agatha’s arm. She hissed in pain, the smell of her own scorched sleeve and flesh curling up around her as she blasted the attacker to ash.</p><p>Rio snarled—a deep, commanding sound—  and dipped lower, gaze flicking between them in a silent, impatient order.</p><p>Agatha felt her throat tighten. <em>She’s giving us her back. She’s telling us to trust her</em>. </p><p>Wanda’s jaw clenched, her magic flaring bright enough to paint her cheekbones in red light. She didn’t like it— Agatha could see the refusal still burning in her eyes— but there was no other way forward. No time left to argue.</p><p>“Fine,” Wanda ground out, already grabbing Agatha’s arm. “Go.”</p><p>Agatha climbed first, her hands sinking into the thick fur at Rio’s shoulders. It was warm, damp with blood, the powerful muscles beneath flexing as if to reassure her— <em>I’ve got you</em>. Wanda swung up behind her in one smooth motion, scarlet magic still sparking at her fingertips like lightning barely leashed.</p><p>The moment they were secure, Rio surged forward.</p><p>She became a battering ram—shoulders slamming into bone walls until they cracked, claws raking open any lycan foolish enough to lunge in her path.Each impact sent vibrations through Agatha’s knees and into her chest, her heartbeat syncing with the pounding rhythm of Rio’s charge. </p><p>The narrow corridor widened— exploding into the last chamber, light spilling ahead from the breach.</p><p>Rio didn’t slow.</p><p>She burst through the final line of attackers, scattering them with brute force, her growl rolling like thunder in their wake. Then she launched herself straight through. The breach.</p><p>The cold air outside slammed into them like a wave—sharp, clean , biting compared to Elandrel’s choking rot. Agatha drank it in, lungs aching, fingers still knotted in Rio’s fur as if letting go might pull her back inside. </p><p>They were out.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The night air struck like ice water—sharp, clean, and alive. </p><p>Agatha gasped it in as though she’d been drowning, her fingers still tangled deep in Rio’s fur, her knuckles white. The smell of pine and damp soil replaced the choking rot of Elandrel, but the echo of its walls groaning lingered in her ears.</p><p>Rio staggered once on the landing, claws gouging deep furrows into the earth before she steadied. Her great chest heaved, steam pouring from her mouth in ragged bursts. The golden glow in her eyes flickered, not fading—just weary, like a lantern battered by storm winds.</p><p>Agatha slid down off her back, boots sinking into the mud. Her knees nearly gave out on impact, every ounce of magic and adrenaline drained from her body. She turned immediately, reaching for Rio’s face, both hands burying in the thick fur of her jaw. “Look at me. We’re okay” Her voice cracked on the last word, sharp wit stripped raw.</p><p>Rio leaned into the touch, heavy and trembling. Her wolf’s form was vast and terrible still, but Agatha saw it—the gentleness in the way she tilted her head into her palms, the memory of recognition in her gold eyes. <em>My Rio. Mine</em>.</p><p>Wanda landed beside them in a flare of red, already turning back toward the breach. Her hands trembled faintly, though she masked it well. </p><p>“It’s closing,” she said, her voice tight. The glow of Elandrel’s collapsing rift spat sparks of green and black into the air, the sound like stone screaming against itself. “But not fast enough. We need to move before anything else spills hrough.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t move. <br/>Couldn’t. <br/>She pressed her forehead against Rio’s muzzle, violet fire still flickering faintly around her fingers. “You came back to me,” she whispered, the words pulled from somewhere deep, ragged and reverent.</p><p>Rio’s breath rumbled against her chest—an answer, wordless but certain.</p><p>Wanda’s gaze softened, just for a heartbeat, before she looked away toward the dark tree line. “We’re not safe yet,” she said quietly. “And if Salem sees her like this… if they learn what the Queen tried to turn her into—”</p><p>“I don’t care what Salem thinks,” Agatha cut in, her sharpness returning with sudden ferocity. She lifted her head, eyes blazing violet. “She’s good. And I’ll burn down anyone who tries to treat her as anything less.”</p><p>For a moment, only the forest wind answered. Then Wanda nodded once, grim but resolute. “Then we keep moving. Together.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, finally pulling her hands from Rio’s fur. She brushed blood from her palms onto her coat, though the shaking in her fingers betrayed her. With a sharp sniff, she straightened her spine, eyes still locked on Rio. “Come along, wolf. Let’s get you home before I lose what’s left of my sanity.”</p><p>Rio huffed—a sound that was half-growl, half something softer—and pressed her shoulder against Agatha’s as they started forward into the trees.</p><p>Behind them, the breach collapsed at last, Elandrel’s death cry fading into the night.</p><p><br/>———</p><p><br/>The forest swallowed them—dark, damp, alive. </p><p>Every step carried them farther from the collapsed breach, but Agatha’s heart refused to slow. She kept her hand buried in Rio’s fur, grounding herself in the solid, trembling weight of her love at her side.</p><p>They didn’t stop until Wanda finally raised a hand, crimson light flickering at her palm. </p><p>“Here,” she said, scanning the shadows between the trees. “This ridge will hold for a while. No scent trails, no light to draw attention. We’re clear… for now.”</p><p>Agatha let out a brittle laugh that sounded nothing like humour. <br/>“Clear, she says. After lycans, witches, and one very persistent giant queen tried to eviscerate us. Yes, Wanda, this feels positively idyllic.” But her knees gave out as she pressed her back to the trunk of a pine, breath catching in shallow, uneven bursts.</p><p>Rio lowered herself heavily beside her, the ground trembling faintly under her wolf’s weight.</p><p>And then—her body began to change.</p><p>Agatha’s throat closed as she watched fur melt away in waves, the enormous shoulders narrowing, claws dulling into fingers. Bones cracked, reformed, her frame shrinking back into itself. </p><p>The sound was brutal, like the forest itself breaking. When it was done, Rio lay on her side in the dirt—human again, naked and trembling, her skin smeared with blood and soot.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered, shrugging off her coat and draping it quickly over her. Her hands trembled as she gathered her up, cradling her against her chest like something fragile she was terrified to touch too hard in case it shattered.</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered open. Gold still lingered faintly in their depths, warm now, alive. Her lips parted, voice rasping broken and halting. “A… Agatha…”</p><p>The sound nearly undid her. Agatha pressed her face into Rio’s damp hair, words spilling out jagged and raw. “You ridiculous, reckless, impossible fool. You nearly died. You nearly—” Her voice cracked, and she bit the inside of her cheek until she tasted blood, refusing to sob. Not here, not with Wanda watching.</p><p>Rio’s hand—shaking, bloodied—lifted weakly to her cheek. “No… let her win,” she murmured, words fractured but fierce. “No take… you. Never… take you.”</p><p>Agatha caught the hand, clutching it hard against her face. Her sharpness failed her then, leaving only a ragged whisper. “You’re mine, do you hear me? Mine. No queen, no collar, no prison will ever, ever, change that.”</p><p>Rio tried to smile, faint but real, her thumb brushing clumsily along Agatha’s jaw. “Agatha…come .”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. “Of course I did. Do give me a little credit, darling, I’ve got a reputation for ruining people’s evenings. Did you think death and despair were going to keep me from you?”</p><p>Her voice was light, cutting—but her tears betrayed her, streaking silently down her face.</p><p>“You’re damn right I came,” she said, fierce again, though her voice shook. “I’d burn through a thousand hells if that’s what it took.”</p><p>Behind them, Wanda stood sentinel at the treeline, scarlet light flickering faintly in her palms. She pretended to keep watch, but Agatha caught the softening in her expression—the flicker of relief.</p><p>Agatha bristled instinctively, pressing a kiss to Rio’s temple as if to stake her claim. “Don’t look at me like that, Maximoff. If you tell anyone I wept, I’ll hex you bald.”</p><p>Wanda’s mouth twitched but she said nothing, eyes shifting back to the dark.</p><p>Agatha pressed her forehead to Rio’s, her voice a whisper now, for her alone. “Rest, my love. You’re safe. You’re home.”</p><p>Rio’s breath rattled out in a broken sigh. “Home… <em>safe</em>.”</p><p>And that—finally, irrevocably—undid her. Agatha clutched Rio closer, biting back another sob with a laugh that was half-sarcasm, half-shattered relief. “Yes, well, don’t make a habit of scaring me like that. Stress is terrible for the complexion.”</p><p>But her hands never stopped shaking as she held her.</p><p>————</p><p>The forest was hushed in the pale grey before dawn, as if it, too, had spent the night holding its breath. Mist curled low between the roots, and the pines groaned softly in the wind.</p><p>Agatha stirred awake where she had slumped against a tree trunk, cloak drawn tight about her shoulders. Wanda lay not far off, still wrapped in the exhaustion of her magic, her chest rising and falling in slow, steady rhythm.</p><p>But Agatha’s eyes found Rio first.</p><p>The wolf-girl crouched a few paces away, bare feet sunk into the damp earth, nostrils flaring as she tasted the air. Her body was taut but not fevered, alive with a sharp alertness that made her look carved from the very woods themselves. </p><p>Agatha’s own coat hung on her frame—too tight across the shoulders, sleeves riding up her forearms, hem too short to fall below her thighs. But it was enough to shield her modesty, and to Agatha’s eyes, she had never looked more striking.</p><p>Relief crashed into her so suddenly her knees went weak. Rio was healthy. Not broken. Not lost.</p><p>She rose without thinking, brushing pine needles from her skirts as she crossed the clearing. “Rio,” she whispered, careful not to wake Wanda.</p><p>At once Rio turned, golden eyes flashing in the dawn light. For a moment Agatha saw the wolf still crouched inside her—wild, wary—but then recognition softened her face. A low sound escaped her chest, closer to a whine than a growl.</p><p>Before Agatha could speak again, Rio moved. She caught the witch around the waist with sudden, startling strength and pulled her down into her lap. Agatha gasped, clutching at her shoulders, but the embrace was steady, certain.</p><p>Rio pressed her face into Agatha’s hair, breathing her in with desperate tenderness. She nosed through the curls at her temple, along the crown of her head, down to the hollow behind her ear. Each inhale was a reassurance, a claiming. A low rumble vibrated against Agatha’s ribs, not threat but devotion, the wolf’s purr.</p><p>Agatha’s hand slid instinctively to the back of her neck, fingers threading into the damp tangles of hair. Her sharp tongue failed her; no words came, only a shuddering breath as she leaned into the heat of Rio’s chest.</p><p>“You impossible creature,” she whispered at last, her voice ragged. “You came back to me whole.”</p><p>Rio only hummed, arms tightening, lips brushing reverently over her temple, pulling her close, and Agatha let herself be gathered against the wolf’s chest. The forest air was cold, biting at her skin, but Rio’s body was all heat, the steady thrum of her heartbeat beating against Agatha’s ribs.</p><p>“For a moment,” Agatha whispered, her voice breaking as her fingers tightened in Rio’s hair, “I thought you were gone. Hers. Lost to me.” She shut her eyes, forehead pressing to Rio’s cheek, forcing herself to breathe. “But I knew—you’d remember. You’d come back. You had to come back.”</p><p>Rio shifted, pulling back just enough to look at her. Golden eyes flickered in the pale dawn light, exhaustion and feral devotion tangled together. Her hand lifted, rough and trembling, and cupped Agatha’s face as if she were something fragile and holy. Her thumb brushed along the tear tracks staining her cheek.</p><p>“Mine,” Rio rasped, raw and certain.</p><p>The word shattered her. A sob caught low in Agatha’s chest, breaking free despite all her iron pride. She covered Rio’s hand with her own, clutching it tight to her face. “Yes,” she breathed, voice ragged. “Yours. Always yours.”</p><p>Rio leaned in, pressing her brow to Agatha’s, holding her as though to fuse them together. Her other arm wound more securely around Agatha’s waist, pulling her into the cradle of her lap until there was no space left between them. She breathed her in, nosing through her curls, her lips brushing along Agatha’s hairline, her temple, the curve of her jaw—small, reverent touches, each one claiming her anew.</p><p>Agatha trembled in her hold, the flood of relief crashing through her leaving only raw devotion behind. She let her head tip back into Rio’s hand, let herself be steadied, cherished, claimed.</p><p>Rio hummed against her, the low wolf’s rumble, and kissed her forehead—clumsy, lingering, but full of a promise that needed no words.</p><p>And so they sat in the clearing as the forest woke around them, Agatha curled in her wolf’s lap, her tears drying against Rio’s skin, both of them holding on as if the world itself might try again to tear them apart.</p><p><br/>⸻</p><p>The sun had begun to climb, spilling long bars of light through the canopy and banishing the last of the mist. </p><p>Agatha sat cross-legged in the dirt, cloak wrapped tightly around her, a book of charms cracked open across her knees. Wanda crouched beside her, scarlet light flickering in her palms as she etched faint sigils into the ground.</p><p>“Even if I anchor us,” Wanda murmured, tracing the glowing line of a rune with her fingertip, “the ley lines here are weak. Salem is leagues away. We’ll need a bridge. A tether.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “And if we misstep, we could spill ourselves into another breach. I’ve had quite enough of alternate hellscapes for one week, thank you.” She snapped the book shut, glaring at it as though it had personally failed her. “We’ll need more than magic. We’ll need precision.”</p><p>Wanda gave her a sidelong look. “You say that like I don’t know what I’m doing.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “Darling, you nearly lit half this forest on fire when you sneezed in your sleep last night. Forgive me if I’d prefer to keep my eyebrows.”</p><p>Behind them, a soft <em>crunch</em> of leaves drew Agatha’s attention.</p><p>Rio was barefoot, hair a wild halo in the morning light, still swallowed awkwardly in Agatha’s coat. She crouched low by the tree line, studying a squirrel that had ventured too close. Her nose twitched as she sniffed the air, head tilting like a hound at the scent. </p><p>Then, with startling suddenness, she let out a short, playful <em>huff</em>—and the squirrel bolted up a tree in alarm.</p><p>Rio barked a laugh that sounded more like a startled growl, then plopped back into the dirt, utterly delighted with herself. She tore a pinecone from the ground, turned it over in her hands as if it were treasure, and promptly began to gnaw at it with sharp little bites.</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. “Gods preserve me.”</p><p>Wanda’s mouth twitched, though she kept her focus on the rune circle. “She’s… adapting.”</p><p>“She’s chewing a pinecone, Maximoff.”</p><p>“Yes, well.” Wanda smothered a laugh, lips twitching again. “Better than chewing you, isn’t it?”</p><p>Agatha cut her a sharp look, though the corner of her mouth betrayed her with a curl of amusement. She turned her gaze back to Rio, who now sat with the pinecone in her lap, humming a low tune that sounded more growl than song.</p><p>The witch’s chest softened despite herself. “Fool creature,” she murmured under her breath, before snapping her attention back to the sigils. “Fine. Let’s do this properly before she decides to eat bark as well.”</p><p>Wanda bit back a grin, hands steadying over the glowing circle. “On three?”</p><p>Agatha sighed and rolled her shoulders, power beginning to gather around her fingertips. “On three.”</p><p><br/>The circle pulsed beneath their hands, violet and scarlet threads weaving into a lattice of raw power. The air thickened, heavy with the taste of iron and pine resin.</p><p>“Careful,” Agatha muttered, eyes narrowed as she guided a rune into place. “Our magic is almost dried out after last night.”</p><p>“I know what I’m doing,” Wanda replied evenly, though a faint tremor betrayed her exhaustion. Crimson fire bled from her fingertips, steadying into the lines Agatha had carved.</p><p>The arch shivered before them, a thin film of light stretched taut like the skin of a drum.</p><p>A low huff broke the tension.</p><p>Rio crouched at the clearing’s edge, bare feet pressing into damp earth, Agatha’s coat loose on her shoulders. Her head lifted, nose to the wind. She sniffed once, twice, and a low, warning rumble rose from her chest.</p><p>“She doesn’t trust it,” Wanda said softly.</p><p>Agatha forced her gaze back to the weave, jaw set. “She doesn’t understand it.”</p><p>But a twist of doubt coiled in her gut. Rio’s instincts had saved her before.</p><p>The portal flared. With a sharp crack, the air split wide, spilling light across the forest floor. The scent of ozone and river water rushed out, sharp and clean.</p><p>Agatha’s breath left her in a rush. “There. Salem.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t hesitate. She stepped through. The light swallowed her whole.</p><p>Agatha started forward, but Rio’s hand seized her wrist. A growl tore from the wolf-girl’s throat, not in anger but in warning. For a heartbeat, Agatha nearly pulled free—nearly snapped at her for the delay. Then the portal <em>shifted</em>.</p><p>The light buckled. A pressure slammed outward from the arch, invisible but immense, like a hand shoving her chest. Agatha staggered back with a gasp, her grip on Rio the only thing keeping her upright.</p><p>And then—<br/>the portal twisted, warped, and <em>rejected</em> them.</p><p>Agatha was thrown backward into the dirt. Rio fell with her, both of them tangled in a rush of light and noise as the arch splintered apart with the sound of shattering glass.</p><p>When Agatha’s vision cleared, she was no longer in the forest.</p><p>A field stretched around them, endless rows of churned soil under a grey sky that seemed to press down like a weight. The air stank of iron and damp stone. </p><p>At the field’s edge hunched a scarecrow, its shadow stretched long and crooked across the furrows.</p><p>Agatha pushed herself up, her chest heaving. “This isn’t Salem.”</p><p>Rio’s hand was still on her wrist, grounding, steady. Her nostrils flared as she lifted her face to the wind, a low growl vibrating deep in her chest.</p><p>Something was wrong. </p><p><em>Very</em> wrong.</p><p>From the field came a faint sound—like the soil shifting, breathing.</p><p>And from behind the veil of silence, Agatha thought she heard Wanda’s voice, faint and distant, calling her name.</p><p>But the portal was gone.</p><p><br/>Agatha steadied herself on shaking knees, cloak clutched close, eyes sweeping the horizon. </p><p>Salem was gone. Wanda was gone. </p><p>Only the field remained—black soil furrowed into endless rows, wet under a sky the colour of bruised iron.</p><p>The scarecrow hunched at the edge of the nearest row. Its head was nothing but a burlap sack, sagging and stained, its arms outstretched on a rotten frame of wood. </p><p>But its shadow—its shadow bent wrong. Stretched far too long across the furrows, twitching at the edges like fingers flexing.</p><p>Rio’s growl deepened. She stepped in front of Agatha, shoulders squared, every muscle taut. Her nostrils flared, golden eyes sharp and searching.</p><p>The soil shuddered.</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped toward it. One of the furrows rippled as though something massive crawled beneath. A wet tearing sound followed, and then a pale arm thrust up through the mud. Fingers too long, jointed like shovels, clawed at the air.</p><p>Another arm joined it. Then a head, slick with soil, dragged itself into the open. Its eyes were hollow pits, its mouth stretched wide in a voiceless scream.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, violet fire flickering at her fingertips—weak, sputtering.</p><p>The thing pulled itself free of the earth. Then another rose beside it, and another, their bodies glistening with mud, their hollow eyes all fixed on the two intruders.</p><p>The scarecrow’s head <em>twitched</em>. The burlap sack turned toward them with a wet creak.</p><p>Rio’s body trembled—not with fear, but with the strain of holding herself back, of waiting for Agatha’s word. Her hand shot back blindly, gripping Agatha’s wrist, steadying, grounding.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, voice low and sharp. “We’re not welcome here.”</p><p>The soil split again. More bodies clawed their way up, dozens now, their whispers hissing like wind through dry reeds. </p><p>The scarecrow’s stitched grin stretched wider, impossibly wide, as if it delighted in their arrival.</p><p>Agatha’s magic flared uselessly in her palm. Too weak. Not enough.</p><p>“Run,” she hissed.</p><p>Rio didn’t need telling twice. She yanked Agatha into motion, dragging her back toward the tree line as the creatures lurched forward, pulling themselves free of the soil with grotesque, shovelling arms.</p><p>Behind them, the scarecrow’s head turned to follow, its grin gleaming through the grey.</p><p><br/>The whispers followed them into the trees, thin and many-voiced, weaving through the branches like smoke. The ground itself seemed to shift beneath their feet, roots clawing at Agatha’s skirts as she stumbled after Rio’s unrelenting pace.</p><p>“Faster,” Agatha hissed, though her lungs burned. She could feel the press of those hollow eyes on her back, the scrape of clawed fingers dragging through the soil behind them.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer. Her grip on Agatha’s wrist was iron, dragging her over brambles, through mud, vaulting roots as though she’d lived in these woods her whole life. Her coat flapped loose around her, her breath harsh and low, but she didn’t falter.</p><p>A shriek split the air—one of the soil-things had found its voice. It was thin, jagged, like stone tearing against stone.</p><p>Agatha risked a glance back. Figures lurched between the trees, mud dripping from their limbs, their eyeless faces turned toward her. </p><p>Too many.<br/> Dozens.</p><p>Her magic sparked at her palm, violet threads unraveling before they could take form. Too drained. Too soon after Elandrel had taken everything of her.</p><p>“Damn it all,” she spat, forcing her legs to move faster.</p><p>Then Rio skidded to a halt so suddenly that Agatha nearly collided with her. She sniffed sharply, head turning. A growl built in her chest, low and urgent, before she pulled Agatha hard to the left.</p><p>There, half-hidden by tangled vines, stood a house.</p><p>Its roof sagged, beams bowed with rot, windows black and hollow. The door leaned open on a broken hinge, creaking faintly with the wind. The very sight of it made Agatha’s skin crawl, but Rio tugged her forward with absolute certainty.</p><p>The whispers rose behind them, the soil-creatures closing fast.</p><p>They stumbled through the doorway just as the nearest shriek echoed too close. Rio slammed the warped door shut with her shoulder, wood splintering but holding. She pressed her back to it, chest heaving, golden eyes fixed on the dark interior.</p><p>Agatha bent double, clutching at her knees as she fought for breath. “We’re… trapped in a ruin,” she managed, voice sharp though it trembled underneath.</p><p>Rio didn’t move from the door. Her nostrils flared, scenting the stale air. She made a low sound—uneasy, but not panicked.</p><p>Agatha straightened, sweeping the room with her eyes. Dust, broken furniture, long-rotted wood. But in the far corner, carved deep into the wall, she saw runes gouged into the timber—wards. </p><p>Old, jagged, half-faded, but wards nonetheless.</p><p>Her breath caught. “Someone tried to keep them out,” she whispered.</p><p>Another shriek came from the tree line. The creatures clawed at the earth just beyond the walls, but they did not breach the threshold. Not yet.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, sharp and bitter. “Well. Congratulations. You’ve led us straight into a prison of our own choosing.”</p><p>Rio glanced back at her, hair wild around her face, eyes still bright with that golden glimmer. She huffed once, almost defiant, as if to say: <em>Better inside than in their jaws.</em></p><p>Agatha lifted her chin, swallowing the unease twisting in her gut. </p><p>“Fine. Then we wait. But come dawn—” Her voice softened, almost despite herself. “We find a way out. Whatever this place is… it will not hold long.”</p><p>Outside, the whispers circled the house, patient and unending.</p><p> </p><p>The house breathed around them. Every groan of the beams, every sigh of the rotting boards sounded like a warning, but the wards etched into the walls still pulsed faintly, a dull glow hidden deep in the cuts. Outside, the whispers circled, patient, but the threshold held.</p><p>Agatha stood in the dim room, her cloak still clutched around her shoulders, listening. When no shriek pierced the air, no claw struck the door, she finally let out a long, measured breath.</p><p>“Fragile,” she murmured, eyes narrowing on the runes, “but it will do.”</p><p>Rio had already moved deeper inside, bare feet silent against the dust-caked floor. She dragged an old trunk into the light and tugged at its swollen lid, prying it open with a low grunt. Inside lay moth-eaten remnants of clothing. She dug through them quickly, pulling out a man’s shirt and trousers—frayed, but intact enough to wear.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked toward her. The sight of Rio shrugging into the shirt, the fabric stretching across her shoulders, the trousers cinched at the waist with a strip of rope—something about it caught at her throat. So human and so utterly wild at once.</p><p>“You look ridiculous,” Agatha said dryly, though her voice lacked its usual bite.</p><p>Rio smirked faintly—no words, only that glimmer in her golden eyes. She tugged the rope tighter around herself, then padded across the room, her steps purposeful, deliberate.</p><p>She stopped in front of Agatha, close enough that Agatha could feel the heat of her body in the cold room.</p><p>For the first time since the forest, since the breach, since the rift itself, they were alone. Wanda’s calm, scarlet presence was gone. The monsters circled outside but could not breach. The wards whispered faintly, holding. And in that fragile silence, the weight of everything they had endured pressed down—fear, exhaustion, relief, survival.</p><p>Rio lifted her hand, rough from dirt and claw, and touched Agatha’s face. Her thumb brushed along her cheekbone, smearing the faint line of dried tears Agatha had been too proud to wipe away.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>“Safe,” Rio murmured, her voice raw but certain.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, only for a heartbeat, as if bracing against the flood that rose in her chest. When she opened them again, her sharpness had gentled, her gaze softened in a way she would never allow in daylight.</p><p>“Yes,” she whispered back. “With you.”</p><p>Rio leaned in then, her forehead pressing to Agatha’s, her breath hot against her lips. Her other arm wound around Agatha’s waist, pulling her close, holding her as though to anchor them both in this place, this moment, this fragile sanctuary carved out of ruin.</p><p>Agatha trembled, but she didn’t pull away. She let her hands slide into Rio’s hair, let her lips hover a breath away. And when Rio’s mouth finally brushed hers—tentative, reverent, almost desperate—Agatha kissed her back with all the fire she’d been choking down since the night split open.</p><p>The house groaned. The whispers hissed. But the wards held.</p><p>For the first time, they were truly alone.</p><p>Rio’s kiss started tentative, but it broke quickly under the press of everything unsaid. Agatha gasped against her mouth, her sharp composure fracturing as Rio pulled her closer, deeper, until there was no space left between them.</p><p>The wolf-girl’s hands were rough, urgent, dragging down Agatha’s cloak to find her waist. She lifted her easily, settling her onto the sagging table, wood groaning under their weight. Agatha clutched at Rio’s shoulders, nails digging into fabric, grounding herself in the sheer heat of her.</p><p><br/>The kiss deepened, turned wild, and the last of Agatha’s control snapped. Her hands dragged at Rio’s shirt, tugging it loose, frantic for the heat of bare skin against hers. Rio obliged, shrugging it off in a single fluid motion, the garment falling forgotten to the floor as her mouth crashed back into Agatha’s.</p><p>“You’re impossible,” Agatha breathed, laughter tangled with need as Rio lifted her again, hands firm on her thighs as she spun them both around. Her back hit the wall with a thud, but she hardly noticed, too consumed by the sensation of Rio’s bare chest pressed against hers.</p><p>Rio’s response was lost as her lips trailed down Agatha’s neck, teeth nipping lightly at her pulse point before she began to work at the fastenings of Agatha’s dress. Her fingers were deft despite their roughness, tugging laces free with practiced ease until the fabric loosened enough for Rio to push it from Agatha’s shoulders.</p><p>Agatha arched into her touch as Rio’s hands roamed her newly exposed skin, rough palms dragging over her breasts, thumbs circling slowly around her nipples. She bit her lip, trapping a whimper, but couldn’t suppress the shudder that ran through her as Rio bent to take one peak into her mouth.</p><p>“Beautiful,” Rio murmured against her skin, the word heated. Her tongue flicked out, teasing mercilessly, while her other hand slid lower, gripping Agatha’s thigh as though to hold her in place.</p><p>“Not… fair,” Agatha managed, her head falling back against the wall as Rio switched her attention to her other breast. Her hands fisted in Rio’s hair, not sure if she wanted to push her away or pull her closer.</p><p>Rio’s only response was a low, rumbling growl, the sound vibrating through Agatha’s chest where they were pressed together. Her lips began a slow trail downward, pausing to kiss and lick and nip at every inch of skin she exposed.</p><p>Agatha gasped as Rio lowered her legs to the ground before she dropped to her knees, her mouth tracing the edge of Agatha’s lace undergarments. Golden eyes flicked up, locking with hers, and Agatha felt a fresh wave of heat flood through her at the sight.</p><p>“Rio—” she started, but whatever she meant to say died in her throat as Rio growled, ”Off,” tugging at the silk with her teeth, and Agatha obeyed on shaky legs, reaching down to roll the stockings down and discard them with the rest.</p><p>Naked now, save for her heeled boots, Agatha expected to feel exposed, vulnerable. But as Rio’s eyes raked over her, dark with hunger, she felt only power. She combed her fingers through Rio’s hair, watching as the wolf girl leaned in, breathing deeply against her centre, a low rumble building in her chest.</p><p>“Mine,” Rio whispered again, the word more growl than speech. Then she pressed her mouth fully against Agatha, tongue parting delicate folds with a single, possessive stroke.</p><p>Agatha cried out, the sound echoing in the empty house, and gave herself over to the fire Rio ignited.</p><p>The first touch of Rio’s tongue between her legs made Agatha shudder against the wall, her breath catching in her throat. The wolf girl’s mouth was hot and eager, parting her folds with a single, slow stroke that made Agatha’s knees threaten to buckle.</p><p>Her breath was a warm tease against Agatha’s clit, sending tremors through her body.<br/>Agatha’s fingers dug into Rio’s shoulders, anchoring herself as the wolf girl began to explore her with meticulous care. </p><p>There was no rush in Rio’s movements, no sense of urgency—only a slow, deliberate worship that had Agatha gasping with every pass of her tongue.</p><p>At first, Rio’s licks were delicate, as if mapping every contour of Agatha’s arousal. She circled her clit with feather-light touches, then returned to the sensitive flesh between her legs, drinking in the taste of her as Agatha’s slickness coated her tongue.</p><p>But as Agatha’s moans grew louder, more desperate, Rio’s pace quickened. Her tongue grew more insistent, more demanding, alternating between soft, teasing flicks and deep, penetrating thrusts that made Agatha cry out.</p><p>“Rio—” Agatha gasped, her head falling back against the wall. “God, don’t stop—”<br/>Rio growled softly, the vibration sending shocks through Agatha’s body. </p><p>She increased her tempo, her tongue working Agatha with expert precision, alternating between circling her clit and plunging deep inside her until Agatha’s legs were shaking uncontrollably.</p><p>Agatha’s climax built slowly at first, then all at once—a crescendo of sensation that crashed over her like a wave. Rio’s name tore from her lips as her body arched, her hands tightening in the wolf girl’s hair, holding her close as the pleasure peaked and ebbed.</p><p>Rio didn’t stop until Agatha slumped against the wall, boneless and trembling. Even then, she placed soft, lingering kisses along Agatha’s thighs, her breath hot against oversensitive skin, before finally rising to her feet, a triumphant glint in her golden eyes.</p><p>The bed was a ruin—more springs than mattress, fabric rotted through to expose the skeleton beneath. But it was the only piece of furniture in the room that didn’t threaten to collapse under a determined look, and right now, Agatha needed the stability.</p><p>She guided Rio backward toward it, one hand splayed across the wolf girl’s chest, pushing her firmly down onto the edge of the bed as soon as knees met mattress edge. Rio let out a surprised grunt, then a low, approving hum as Agatha straddled her thighs, still clad in her coat, her naked skin pebbling at the brush of Rio’s rough trousers.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio rasped, her hands immediately finding Agatha’s hips, holding her tight as she rolled them upward in a slow, deliberate grind. Agatha’s breath hitched at the friction, at the sensation of Rio’s still-clothed length pressing hard against her sensitive flesh.</p><p>“You’ll be the death of me,” Agatha murmured, leaning down to capture Rio’s lips once more. The kiss was messy, frantic, all teeth and tongue, but Agatha couldn’t bring herself to care. Not when Rio was rocking up into her like that, not when her own pulse thundered in her ears.</p><p>She reached between them, fumbling at the fastenings of Rio’s trousers, tugging them open just enough to free her cock. It sprang into her hand, hot and heavy, and Agatha bit back a moan at the familiar weight of it.</p><p>“More?” Rio asked, her voice strained with the effort of holding back. Her hips stilled, though her hands tightened on Agatha’s waist.</p><p>Agatha answered without words, shifting her hips to position Rio at her entrance. She was wet, ready, the evidence of her arousal slicking Rio’s length as she began to sink down.</p><p>The stretch burned, exquisite, and Agatha paused when she was fully seated, eyes fluttering closed as she adjusted to the fullness. Rio was motionless beneath her, breath coming in sharp pants, clearly straining not to move.</p><p>“So good for me,” Agatha whispered, opening her eyes to meet Rio’s gaze. She rolled her hips slowly, experimentally, and bit her lip at the sensation. “So, so good.”</p><p>Then she began to move in earnest.</p><p>Her pace started slow, each downward stroke deliberate, relishing the friction and the fullness. But the need coiling in her belly demanded more, and soon she was riding Rio with abandon, gripping the wolf girl’s shoulders for leverage as she ground down onto her cock.</p><p>The bed creaked ominously beneath them, springs protesting as Agatha rode Rio with increasing fervour. Rio had given up all pretence of restraint now, her hips thrusting up to meet Agatha’s downward motions with enough force to drive the breath from her lungs.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio growled, her fingers digging into the flesh of Agatha’s hips hard enough to bruise. “Agatha—”</p><p>Words seemed to fail her, and Agatha understood. There were no words for this, for the raw, elemental need that had consumed them both. Only sounds, only sensations—the slap of skin on skin, the scent of musk and sex, the taste of Rio’s sweat-salt on her tongue as she leaned down to claim her mouth again.</p><p>Their rhythm grew frantic, desperate, bodies striving together toward the peak that loomed so close. Agatha’s nails raked down Rio’s chest, marking her, claiming her as thoroughly as Rio had claimed her, and the wolf girl threw her head back, a guttural cry tearing from her throat.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha gasped against Rio’s neck, biting down on the junction of shoulder and throat. “Gods, <em>I love you</em>.”</p><p>Rio shuddered beneath her, her thrusts growing erratic, and Agatha knew she was close. She reached between them, finding her own clit with unerring precision, and began to circle it with quick, firm strokes.</p><p>The sound Rio made then was animal, primal, and it sent a fresh flood of arousal gushing through Agatha. She ground down harder, circling her fingers faster, and then she was falling, tumbling over the edge into her release.</p><p>Her cry tangled with Rio’s, the two of them clinging to each other as the wave crested, broke, and dragged them under. Agatha slumped forward, boneless, her forehead resting against Rio’s collarbone as they both fought for breath.</p><p>For a long moment, the only sounds were their ragged inhales, the creak of ruined bedsprings, and the distant whispers still circling the house. But in this room, in this fragile sanctuary, they were alone. Together.</p><p>Safe.</p><p>At least for now.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The ruin creaked around them, every sound too loud against the hush that pressed in from outside. The whispers hadn’t ceased—they scraped across the walls, thin as needles, patient as the grave.</p><p>Agatha’s cloak clung damply to her shoulders as she paced the ruined room, violet sparks guttering and dying in her palm. She stared hard at the old ward-marks carved into the timber, her jaw set, but the longer she looked, the more bile burned up her throat.</p><p>Finally, she spoke, voice sharp and bitter.</p><p>“Do you know why Salem turned us away?”</p><p>Rio’s head tilted, golden eyes catching the dim light. She said nothing, but her nostrils flared, as though she could scent the truth before Agatha even gave it voice.</p><p>Agatha’s laugh was jagged, without humour. She turned from the wall to face Rio, her expression twisted with fury she could no longer keep contained.</p><p>“It wasn’t the weakness of the portal. It wasn’t Maximoff’s trembling hands or my spent reserves. Salem’s wards rejected us. The council felt us coming, measured us against their precious laws, and they saw <em>you</em>.”</p><p>She jabbed a finger toward Rio, though her voice wavered under the weight of what she was saying.</p><p>“They saw the wolf I dared to bring back to their sacred ground. The creature I chose to stand beside me. And they said no.”</p><p>Her voice broke into a hiss, sharp as broken glass.</p><p>“I defied them once before—I turned my back on their decrees, their sanctimonious ‘order.’ And now I’ve done it again. I dared to arrive at their gates with you at my side, and for that they cast me out like a heretic. After everything in Elandrel. Saving Salem from ruin.”</p><p>The wind rattled the broken shutters. Outside, the whispers rose, delighted by the venom in her voice.</p><p>Agatha’s hand clenched into a fist, violet sparks sputtering uselessly. She swallowed hard, forcing the next words past the knot in her throat.</p><p>“It isn’t that I am too corrupt, or too damned. It’s that I will not bend. Not to them. Not when it means leaving you behind.”</p><p>Her eyes found Rio’s, and for a heartbeat all the bitterness in her face faltered—replaced by something raw, unguarded.</p><p>“They rejected us because of you. Because of me. Because I chose to defy them again.”</p><p>The house groaned as if in agreement, the old wards humming faintly in their bones.</p><p>And outside, the soil-creatures scraped their claws against the earth, waiting.</p><p><br/>Agatha’s throat worked once before she spoke, voice sharper than she intended.</p><p>“I should tell you… I haven’t always been someone worth trusting.”</p><p>She hesitated, eyes skimming over Rio, then away. “I’ve made choices. Bad ones. Ruthless ones. Things I told myself were clever, necessary. Things that left marks I don’t expect will ever fade.”</p><p>Her hand lifted before she could stop herself, reaching across the dim space. Fingers brushed Rio’s cheek, tracing the line of her jaw with a softness that didn’t belong in a place like this.</p><p>“If you knew everything,” she murmured, quieter now, “you might be disappointed in me.” Her mouth twisted faintly, wry but fragile. “And I… I don’t like that thought.”</p><p>For a moment, the weight of it sat heavy between them. Agatha let her hand linger just long enough to mean something before she pulled back, closing her palm into a fist, sealing the softness away.</p><p>Her tone hardened again, her spine straightening as she turned to the wall marked with faded wards. Sparks flared at her fingertips.</p><p>“Enough. We’re not staying trapped here, not while those things are circling. This place has rules. If there’s a way to keep them out, there’s a way for us to get back through. And I’ll find it.”</p><p>She glanced back at Rio, eyes blue-bright in the gloom. Her voice softened, just once more:</p><p>“Stay close, my love. Whatever this place is… I don’t want to face it without you.”</p><p> </p><p>For a long moment after Agatha drew her hand away, silence filled the ruin. Dust drifted in the thin light slanting through broken boards. The whispers outside scraped and circled, but inside, the world seemed to hold still.</p><p>Rio’s eyes stayed fixed on her, golden and steady. Then, without warning, she leaned into the space Agatha had left behind. Her cheek brushed against Agatha’s knuckles before the witch could lower her hand completely, a soft, deliberate nuzzle—wolfish in its simplicity, and achingly tender.</p><p>A low sound rumbled from her chest. Not a growl, not a warning. Something closer to a hum, soft and reassuring, as though she were answering the unspoken confession with wordless certainty: <em>I see you. I stay</em>.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. For the briefest heartbeat, she let it anchor her, let herself be held by that simple, primal gesture. Her fingers twitched as though they might rise again to cup Rio’s face, to hold her there.</p><p>But then she snapped her palm closed, tucking it back into the folds of her cloak. Her jaw tightened, violet sparks flickering back to life.</p><p>“Don’t look at me like that,” she muttered, more to herself than to Rio. “You’ll have me going soft.”</p><p>She turned sharply toward the wall, her eyes sweeping the carved runes with renewed focus. The determination in her voice was iron again, but the warmth Rio had coaxed into her lingered beneath it, quiet and undeniable.</p><p>“Now,” she said, violet light crawling across her fingertips, “let’s figure out where this cursed portal threw us.”</p><p><br/>Her hands skimmed the carved runes in the wall, sparks tracing their jagged edges. Up close, she could see how old they were—older than the house, older even than the rotting beams they’d been cut into. The symbols bled into one another, rough and desperate, like someone had carved them in fear rather than precision.</p><p>“This wasn’t meant to protect,” she muttered, eyes narrowing. “Not properly. It was scratched in haste. A ward against something that was already here.”</p><p>Behind her, Rio’s low hum deepened. She pressed her palm harder against the warped door, shoulders tight, nose lifting as she scented the stale air.</p><p>Agatha turned, cloak whispering around her legs. “It’s not just a cage. It’s a… boundary marker. A place to keep the things <em>out there</em> from crossing into—” she paused, violet eyes flicking around the sagging room, “—whatever <em>this is</em>.”</p><p>The whispers outside clawed louder at the walls, as if mocking her realisation.</p><p>Rio made a sharp sound- half growl, half bark—and jabbed her chin toward the floor. Agatha followed her gaze and crouched, running her fingertips across the warped planks. At first it was just dirt and splintered wood. Then—etched faintly into the boards—she saw the shape of a sigil, barely visible under the grime.</p><p>A doorway rune.</p><p>Her breath caught. “Or... This isn’t a refuge. It’s an entry point.”</p><p>She pressed her palm flat against the floor, violet sparks crawling outward, lighting the sigil in faint, trembling light. It pulsed once, then twice, as though waking from long slumber. The air thickened, heavy with iron and smoke.</p><p><br/>The house shuddered as a shriek split the air outside, closer than before. The door rattled under Rio’s weight. The soil-things were testing the threshold.</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. She curled her hand over the rune, sparks brightening with sudden resolve. “We don’t have time to doubt. Either we take this path, or we let them pull us apart piece by piece.”</p><p>She looked at Rio—really looked—before whispering, “Stay with me. No matter what’s on the other side.”</p><p>Rio leaned down just far enough to brush her forehead against Agatha’s temple—brief, rough, but grounding. Then she huffed once, sharp and certain, as if to say <em>always</em>.</p><p>The sigil flared. The boards groaned. The floor split open in a blaze of violet light—</p><p><br/>The ruin gave way beneath them in a rush of violet light. Agatha’s stomach lurched, her cloak whipping around her as she and Rio plunged into the void.</p><p>The impact came hard and sudden. Agatha hit the ground on her side, air knocked clean out of her lungs. She braced on her palms, coughing, and froze.</p><p>The ground was smooth. Swept. Not damp soil or rotting planks. She blinked hard, breath catching in her chest.</p><p>They weren’t in ruins anymore.</p><p>The room they’d landed in was dim but cared for. Heavy curtains hung against the windows, stitched in thick, protective sigils. Shelves lined the walls, stacked neatly with jars and old books. A kettle steamed faintly on a stone hearth, filling the air with the scent of rosemary and something sharper—oak resin, maybe.</p><p>And beneath all of that, stronger than the smoke or dust, Agatha felt it: power. Old, steady, threaded through every stone. Another witch’s claim.</p><p>She scrambled to her feet, violet sparks flickering in her hands. “We’re not alone.”</p><p>Rio was already crouched low, hackles raised, golden eyes fixed on the far corner of the room.</p><p>A sharp sound split the quiet—a startled intake of breath.</p><p>From the shadowed stairwell, a woman appeared. Dark curls streaked with silver framed her sharp face, her eyes wide and wary. She wore a colourful dress, sleeves rolled back to bare wrists inked with runes.</p><p>Her gaze darted between Agatha and Rio, her fingers lifting in instinctive defence. “Who—” her voice cracked, then steadied. “Who in hell are you?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, her hand still alight. Recognition tugged at the edges of her memory.</p><p>“Calderu,” she breathed.</p><p>The woman’s mouth twisted, half-bitter, half-surprised. “I haven’t heard that name in decades.”</p><p>Rio’s growl vibrated low in her chest, but Agatha’s hand lifted sharply, steadying her. Her eyes stayed fixed on the woman. “Lilia Calderu. Shunned by Salem for predicting their fall. Branded false. I remember the trial.”</p><p>Lilia’s laugh was short and humourless. “Of course you do. Everyone remembers my disgrace. None remember that I was right.” Her eyes gleamed strangely in the half-light. “They cast me out, and this cursed place swallowed me whole.”</p><p>She stepped forward, her voice taut. “I’ve been trapped here ever since. There’s no crossing back. Not for me. My magic is strong enough to keep this house standing, to hold the filth outside at bay… but not enough to tear a portal home.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach turned. The air here was thick with power, yes—but it was woven into the house, the wards, the careful protections. Not reaching outward, not breaking through.</p><p>“How long?” Agatha asked, though the answer already clawed at her gut.</p><p>Lilia’s smile was tight, haunted. “Years. Decades, perhaps. Time here runs crooked. Long enough to know Salem won’t come looking.” Her eyes lingered on Agatha then, sharp and assessing. “If you’re here, then Salem has shut its gates to you as well.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. She said nothing.</p><p>Lilia’s gaze slid to Rio, lingering on the coat too large for her frame, the golden eyes gleaming in the half-dark. “And you’ve brought ….a wolf into their sacred circle. No wonder they spat you out.”</p><p>Rio’s rumble deepened, protective and low.</p><p>Agatha moved closer, standing between them without thought, her violet sparks sparking brighter.</p><p>“We don’t intend to rot here, Calderu,” she said, voice like steel. “If Salem shut its gates, then I’ll find another. There’s always another.”</p><p>Lilia tilted her head, lips curling faintly. “That’s what I once believed too.”</p><p>For the first time since they’d fallen through the floor, Agatha felt something colder than fear stirring in her chest: the gnawing possibility that they weren’t the first, and they wouldn’t be the last.</p><p>She didn’t sit. She paced instead, cloak trailing against the stone floor, violet sparks still dancing at her fingertips. The air in this place gnawed at her—familiar magic, but twisted, bent under the weight of something older.</p><p>Lilia watched her like one might watch a restless cat, arms folded across her chest. Rio had yet to move from her post by the door, shoulders squared, nostrils flaring as if she could scent every crack in the stone, every shift in the air.</p><p>Finally, Agatha’s voice cut the silence. “Where are we?”</p><p>Lilia’s mouth curved faintly, but there was no humour in it. “A question I’ve been asking for half a century.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped to her. “Don’t play games. You’ve survived here this long—you know something.”</p><p>The older witch leaned against the stairwell, her gaze drifting to the shelves of books and jars that lined the walls. </p><p>“This place has no name. Not one that matters. Call it a pit, a fold between realms, a scar left behind when Salem’s wards were laid. All I know is this: witches the council rejects do not die. They are cast here. Hidden. Forgotten.”</p><p>Her voice sharpened, bitter as ash. “A graveyard for the inconvenient.”</p><p>Agatha stilled. Her pulse beat a little too loud in her ears.</p><p>Rio growled low, a ripple of unease in her chest. She moved a step closer to Agatha, brushing against her cloak.</p><p>“And the creatures outside?” Agatha asked, her tone flatter now.</p><p>Lilia’s eyes flicked to the warded door. “The soil remembers everything that’s buried in it. It grows restless. It spits up shadows, husks, the dead that Salem would rather not account for. They don’t stop. They don’t tire. They wait.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth tightened. “So Salem knew what it was doing.”</p><p>“Oh yes.” Lilia’s smile was thin, cruel. “They call it justice. But what they’ve built is a tomb that breathes.”</p><p>The silence after those words was heavy. Agatha stared at the shelves, the carved sigils in the walls, the kettle still steaming gently on the hearth. All of it neat, orderly, like a parody of home.</p><p>Her fingers twitched once before she clenched them into her cloak. “And you’ve never found a way out.”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes hardened. “Not for lack of trying.” She lifted her hands, runes inked deep into her skin. “I’ve burned through every spell I know. The air itself eats magic here. It feeds on it. I can keep this house standing. But a portal? A door back to our realm?” She shook her head. “Alone, I’ll never have the strength.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze cut to Rio. The wolf-girl was watching her intently, golden eyes bright, as if she already knew Agatha was weighing the risk in her mind.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, sharp and steady. “Then it’s a good thing you’re not alone anymore.”</p><p>Lilia seemed to still at that, observing them both quietly with unspoken words on the tip of her tongue. </p><p>“Well, you both look half-starved,” she said at last, her voice cutting through the thick silence of the cottage. She turned toward the hearth where a rabbit turned slowly over coals, the smell of rosemary and fat thick in the air. </p><p>“Sit. Eat. Whatever else this place is, I won’t have strangers fainting on my floor.”</p><p>Agatha bristled automatically, sparks flickering faintly at her fingertips. “We didn’t come here to share supper.”</p><p>Lilia arched a brow. “Then consider it a truce. Even enemies deserve food before the fight.” She pulled the pot from the fire and began ladling steaming stew into chipped bowls.</p><p>Agatha stayed standing, cloak wrapped tight around her shoulders, watching every movement. But beside her, Rio’s nostrils flared, golden eyes snapping to the pot the moment the rabbit hit the broth. Hunger lit her gaze sharp as a blade.</p><p>Lilia noticed. A faint chuckle slipped from her lips. “Ah. So the beast <em>is</em> starved”</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped around, violet light crackling in her palm. “Watch yourself.”</p><p>But Rio was already moving. She crouched onto the bench with none of the restraint Agatha demanded, seized the bowl, and tore into the meat with sharp teeth and low, eager sounds.</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. “For the love of—”</p><p>Lilia laughed softly, shaking her head. “She eats like the wolf she is. There’s no shame in it.”</p><p>At that, Rio froze mid-bite, golden eyes flicking up to find both witches watching. For a heartbeat she looked ready to growl. Instead, she dragged her gaze to the table, spotted the fork, and—awkward, clumsy—snatched it up. She stabbed at a chunk of rabbit, nearly losing it, then managed to lift it toward her mouth with stubborn precision.</p><p>The faintest curve tugged at Agatha’s lips before she caught herself. She folded her arms tighter across her chest.</p><p>Rio huffed through her nose, as if daring anyone to laugh again.</p><p>Lilia, of course, did. </p><p>“Salem has always feared what it doesn’t understand,” she said, settling into her chair with her own bowl. <br/>“Wolves. Prophets. Anyone who doesn’t fit neatly into their little order. They branded me a liar when I warned them their city would fall, and cast me out. This place took me instead.” Her eyes slid to Rio, then Agatha. “And when you came tethered to her, they slammed their gates shut.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened, violet sparks twitching at her fingertips. “Then they’ve made their mistake twice.”</p><p>Lilia’s gaze lingered on her, thoughtful, almost pitying. “Or they’ve locked themselves away so tightly that no witch, wolf, or prophecy will ever break them open again.”</p><p>The cottage went quiet again but for the scrape of Rio’s fork, clumsy but persistent, as she finished her meal.</p><p><br/>Later, when the fire had burned low, and shadows stretched long across the cottage walls, Lilia sat back in her chair, studying them both with the kind of stillness that made Agatha bristle. She didn’t like being inspected. Especially not by another witch.</p><p>“So,” Lilia said at last, her tone deceptively light, “the wolf.”</p><p>Rio froze mid-stretch, golden eyes flashing toward her. A low hum rumbled in her chest, protective and uncertain.</p><p>Agatha’s hand stilled around her cloak. “Careful how you speak.”</p><p>But Lilia only tilted her head, eyes narrowing as if she were listening to something deeper than the room itself. <br/>“She isn’t just a wolf. She isn’t just human, either. I can <em>feel</em> it. Threads of moonlight, woven into her marrow. Power like that doesn’t happen by accident.”</p><p>Her gaze sharpened, almost curious. “Is that why you’re bound to her? Because she was made of the moon’s power, and you couldn’t resist?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, a cutting retort already on her tongue. She should have said <em>non of your business</em>. She should have scorched the question from the air with sparks. Instead, she found herself glancing at Rio, who was watching her with those steady, patient eyes.</p><p>And the truth slipped through.</p><p>“No.” Her voice was quieter than she meant it to be. “I didn’t even understand her, not at first. She was wild, unpredictable, a storm I had no reason to trust.”</p><p>Her throat tightened as the words came anyway, raw and unguarded. “But I loved her. Harder, faster than I ever thought myself capable of. And once it started, there wasn’t a spell in this world that could have stopped it.”</p><p>Rio’s nostrils flared. She shifted closer on the bench, her knee brushing Agatha’s. A soft huff left her chest, low and warm, like an instinctive answer.</p><p>Agatha let herself meet her gaze, just for a heartbeat, before she snapped her chin up toward Lilia, her tone sharpening again. “That’s all you get.”</p><p>Lilia’s mouth curved, unreadable. “Interesting.”</p><p>The fire popped in the hearth. Outside, the whispers scraped faintly against the wards.</p><p>Agatha’s hand twitched as though it wanted to reach for Rio again. She curled it back into her cloak instead.</p><p>Lilia’s gaze lingered on them both, sharp and thoughtful. The fire painted lines across her face, shadows deepening in her eyes.</p><p>“She’s already walked Salem’s streets. Already passed their wards once.” Her tone was calm, almost clinical. “If they rejected you both now, it isn’t because she cannot enter. It’s because they fear what she’s becoming.”</p><p>Agatha’s chin lifted, violet sparks twitching faintly across her knuckles. “Choose your next words carefully, Calderu.”</p><p>But Lilia didn’t flinch. “If the wolf inside her was born of the moon, then she may be the only one who can tear this place open. A seam, a weakness, a lock only her kind of power can fit. You feel it too, don’t you? Every breath she takes shakes my wards.”</p><p>Rio made a low sound in her chest, unsettled by the scrutiny. Her eyes flicked to Agatha, golden and searching.</p><p>Agatha’s hand shot out before she could stop herself, resting against Rio’s arm. Protective. Anchoring. Her voice was low but sharp. “She isn’t a weapon. She isn’t a key. She’s… mine.”</p><p>For the first time since she’d spoken, her voice softened, caught on the truth of it. “And that’s all Salem needs to know. That’s all you need to know.”</p><p>Rio leaned into her touch, the growl in her chest shifting into a steadier hum. She brushed her cheek against Agatha’s shoulder, a wordless vow of loyalty.</p><p>Lilia studied the two of them in silence, then finally leaned back in her chair. “You can dress it in love if you want. But love and power often speak the same language. Sooner or later, you may have to decide which one you’re willing to wield.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes burned a flash of violet as she met her gaze. “If it comes to that, Calderu, you’ll find I’ve never had trouble choosing.”</p><p><br/>The fire snapped, shadows crawling up the cottage walls. Lilia rose without a word, crossing to a shelf lined with jars and bundles of herbs. She pulled free a small knife, its blade etched with faint runes, and a smooth slab of stone worn with use.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“Proving what we already know,” Lilia said simply. She set the stone on the table between them and began carving, the knife scratching out a circle, then a crescent within it. Her hand was steady, precise, each line cut deep. When she finished, the sigil pulsed faintly, a glow like pale silver bleeding from the grooves.</p><p>Agatha stiffened, sparks flaring faintly at her fingertips. “Don’t you dare—”</p><p>Lilia cut her off with a sharp look. “This place feeds on our magic. You’ve felt it. I’ve felt it. But her power?” She gestured at Rio. “It isn’t ours. It comes from beyond these walls, beyond Salem itself. If anything can touch the seam between realms, it’s her.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, caramel eyes fixed on the glowing crescent. Her nostrils flared as she sniffed, a low hum vibrating in her chest.</p><p>Agatha reached out, catching her wrist before she could move. “No.” Her voice was quiet but edged with panic. “You don’t know what it will do to her.”</p><p>Lilia folded her arms, unimpressed. “You’re afraid it will prove me right.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes blazed as she turned on her. “I’m afraid of <em>using</em> her. She isn’t a weapon to be tested.”</p><p>Rio made a soft, impatient huff, her golden gaze steady on Agatha. Slowly, deliberately, she pulled her wrist free from the witch’s grip. Her hand hovered over the stone, fingers trembling, before pressing flat against the carved crescent.</p><p>The reaction was instant.</p><p>Light surged up her arm in a rush, silver and alive, flooding the cottage in pale brilliance. The wards carved into the beams shuddered, flaring as if struck. Outside, the whispers shrieked all at once, clawing at the walls like the sound of dry reeds ripping apart.</p><p>Rio gasped, her body trembling, but she didn’t pull away. The glow spread across her skin like veins lit from within, her eyes blazing gold as she held against the sigil.</p><p>Agatha surged to her side, one hand on her shoulder, steadying her. “Enough,” she hissed. “Let go!”</p><p>But Rio didn’t move. The glow pulsed once, twice, then burst outward in a shockwave that rattled every jar on Lilia’s shelves. The silver light snapped back into the stone and went out, leaving the room dim and hushed once more.</p><p>Rio staggered, breath ragged, but Agatha caught her, pulling her close against her chest.</p><p>For the first time in years, Lilia looked shaken. “Saints preserve us,” she whispered. “The wolf really <em>is</em> moon-born. And she can shake the seams of this realm.”</p><p>Agatha cradled Rio against her, glaring over her head with sparks snapping at her fingertips. “Say one word about turning her into a key, Calderu, and I’ll show you how sharp regret feels.”</p><p>Lilia said nothing. She only looked at Rio—half in awe, half in fear.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>The silence after the light died was sharp and heavy, the kind that presses on the chest. Rio sagged against Agatha, breath harsh, golden eyes still faintly glowing in the dimness. Agatha held her close, one hand curled protectively at the back of her neck, sparks jittering along her other palm.</p><p>Then the first sound came.</p><p>A scrape. Long, slow. Nails across stone.</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped toward the window. Beyond the curtain, shadows shifted.</p><p>Another scrape. Then another. Until the sound multiplied, layering into a chorus of claws dragging through soil, wood, and bone. The whispers rose like smoke, hissing and many-voiced, pressing tight around the cottage.</p><p>Lilia’s face had gone pale. She turned toward the door, wards glowing faintly against the strain. “They felt it. The creatures—they felt her shake the seam.”</p><p>The next moment, the door shuddered with a violent slam, wood splintering under the force.</p><p>Rio’s head lifted sharply from Agatha’s shoulder, a growl tearing low from her chest. She stumbled to her feet, bracing against the table, her golden eyes blazing as the hum in her throat built into something wilder.</p><p>Agatha caught her wrist. “No—don’t—”</p><p>But the door cracked again, fissures racing through the old wood. The shutters rattled, one tearing free of its hinges and crashing inward. A pale, mud-slick arm forced its way through the gap, fingers jointed like shovels clawing for purchase.</p><p>Lilia’s voice was taut, urgent. “If the wards break, they’ll tear the house apart!”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. She pulled Rio back against her side, whispering fiercely into her ear, “If they get through, you don’t fight alone. You fight with me. You hear me?”</p><p>Rio’s golden gaze locked on hers, sharp and steady. She gave one short, sharp huff — wolfish, certain — before she turned back to the door, muscles taut and trembling with the need to unleash herself.</p><p><br/>The cottage shuddered under the pounding outside. Wards crackled and dimmed, one by one, their light fading like dying stars.</p><p>Agatha’s grip on Rio’s arm was tight. “Stay close—”</p><p>But Rio’s body lurched violently, a shudder tearing through her frame. Her breath hitched into a growl, low and raw. Her nails split into claws with a sickening crack, bones shifting under her skin. Agatha barely had time to catch the flash of golden fire in her eyes before her body snapped and reshaped itself.</p><p>The girl was gone in seconds.</p><p>In her place rose the wolf. Massive, sleek, fur black as pitch, eyes blazing with molten gold that cut through the dim cottage like twin lanterns. Her presence filled the room, wild and undeniable, the air charged with the hum of lunar power.</p><p>Agatha staggered back, heart slamming in her chest. “Rio…” Her voice cracked between awe and fear.</p><p>The door burst inward with a thunderous crack. Mud-born creatures swarmed through, eyeless faces twisted, arms shovelling through air and splintered wood.</p><p>Rio met them head-on. She launched herself into the first, jaws clamping down on its throat with a crunch that sent it crumbling to wet soil. Another swung its jagged limbs at her — she twisted, fur flashing black in the firelight, and tore through its chest with a snarl that rattled the beams overhead.</p><p>Lilia’s voice rang sharp over the chaos, runes flaring white-hot across her arms. “Keep her near the wards! If she strays, they’ll drown her!”</p><p>But Rio wasn’t listening. She was a storm let loose — black fur and golden fire ripping through the tide of creatures, scattering them like dried leaves. For every one she shredded to earth, two more shoved through the splintered door, shrieking, clawing.</p><p>Agatha’s magic flared violet, searing a line across the floor that split three in half. “Rio!” she shouted, her voice raw, desperate. “Don’t tear yourself apart—fight with me!”</p><p>The great black head whipped toward her. Those molten-gold eyes locked on hers, wild and burning. And for a heartbeat, everything stilled.</p><p>Then Rio bounded back, massive shoulders brushing Agatha’s cloak, planting herself at her side like a living wall of muscle and fury. Her growl rumbled deep and low, vibrating through Agatha’s bones.</p><p>Agatha pressed her trembling hand into that dark fur, sparks dancing faintly against it. “Together,” she whispered. “Always together.”</p><p>Rio huffed sharply in answer, breath hot and certain against her cheek.</p><p>The wards shattered.</p><p><br/>The cottage became a battlefield.</p><p>Mud-born bodies poured through the broken door and shattered windows, shrieking with voices that didn’t belong to them. Their clawed limbs scraped across the walls, tearing through shelves, smashing jars, spilling herbs and dust into the air. The wards flared once more, then guttered and died with a sound like breaking glass.</p><p>Agatha’s violet fire seared across the swarm, her arm snapping wide to split them with a hiss of burning soil. Lilia shouted from the far corner, runes blazing up her skin as she flung ward after ward, each one tearing another shadow back into the dirt.</p><p>And Rio—</p><p>Rio was a storm.</p><p>She hurled herself into the creatures, black fur flashing, golden eyes searing in the dim light. Her jaws tore through them, her claws shredded limbs, her body a weapon of pure instinct. Every one she struck fell back into soil, but more pressed forward, their eyeless faces glowing with cold hunger.</p><p>Agatha fought her way toward her, cloak tangled, sparks dancing violently off her fingertips. “Don’t let them surround you—”</p><p>But they were already circling, mud-born arms clawing up from the floorboards themselves. One dragged across Agatha’s ankle, cold and slick, and she cried out—</p><p>Until Rio tore it away with a single brutal snap of her jaws, the soil-born body collapsing into dust at her feet. The wolf pressed close, her massive frame braced against Agatha’s side, snarling with a fury that shook the room.</p><p>The beams overhead groaned, wood splitting under the weight of too many bodies.</p><p>Lilia’s voice broke through the chaos, sharp and frantic. “The house won’t hold!”</p><p>A crack split the ceiling. Dust and splinters rained down as the roof sagged, ready to give way.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes locked onto Rio, chest heaving. “Get us out—carve the way!”</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. She lunged for the doorframe, tearing through the swarm in her path. Mud-born bodies crumbled under her jaws, under her claws, clearing a jagged line through the tide. Agatha followed in her shadow, violet fire hissing through the gaps, while Lilia brought up the rear, runes flaring white-hot as she blasted the stragglers back into the dark.</p><p>The roof collapsed behind them with a thunderous roar. The cottage crumpled in on itself, swallowing fire, shelves, and wards alike into ruin.</p><p>And then they were outside.</p><p>The night air hit sharp and cold. Shadows writhed at the edges of the field, dozens—hundreds—of hollow-eyed creatures waiting. The whispers rose into a chorus, furious and hungry.</p><p>Rio stood in front of them, black fur bristling, golden eyes glowing like twin moons. She bared her teeth, a snarl rolling deep from her chest, and the horde shifted back as if even they understood the danger of what stood before them.</p><p>Agatha stepped to her side, sparks burning violet in her palms. “We move,” she hissed, jaw tight. “Before they close in again.”</p><p>The wolf’s golden gaze flicked to her. Then Rio huffed once, low and certain, before pushing forward into the dark, carving them a path with teeth and fire.</p><p><br/>The three of them tore through the field, mud-born shadows lunging from the furrows, shrieking as Rio ripped through them. Agatha’s violet fire seared a clear path at her flank, and Lilia’s runes blazed behind them, striking down whatever tried to close in.</p><p>The land was endless rows of churned soil, black and wet, stretching under a sky the colour of bruised iron. The scarecrow still hunched at the edge of the field, its grin stretched impossibly wide, its shadow writhing as though delighted by the chase.</p><p>“Don’t look back!” Agatha snapped, her breath ragged, sparks sputtering weakly from her palms. “Keep moving!”</p><p>Rio leapt a furrow, jaws snapping down on a creature that clawed too close. Her black fur was streaked with mud, golden eyes blazing, her snarl cutting through the shrieks. She drove forward relentlessly, her sheer force carving them space until—</p><p>The ground shifted.</p><p>What had seemed like endless soil gave way to stone. A jagged slope rose before them, carved by some long-dead river. The air was sharper here, cleaner—thinner.</p><p>Rio bounded up the incline, scattering loose rock beneath her paws. Agatha stumbled after her, cloak torn, lungs burning. Lilia dragged herself up last, wards flickering faintly at her fingertips.</p><p>At the crest, the horde faltered. They clawed at the base of the slope, shrieking, but none crossed onto the stone.</p><p>Agatha fell to her knees, chest heaving, sparks guttering out at last. She pressed a shaking hand to the ground. “A boundary,” she rasped. “The creatures can’t pass it.”</p><p>Lilia collapsed beside her, sweat streaking her face. “This whole place is carved with lines like this. Cages within cages. Safe for now… not for long.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Her gaze was on Rio.</p><p>The wolf’s chest heaved with each breath, black fur bristling, muzzle slick with soil. But her golden eyes softened as she turned toward Agatha, stepping close. She pressed her massive head against Agatha’s shoulder, the growl in her chest fading to a low, exhausted hum.</p><p>Agatha lifted trembling fingers, stroking through the coarse fur at her neck, her touch grounding them both. Her voice cracked, softer than she intended. “You’ll burn yourself out fighting for me, won’t you?”</p><p>Rio huffed, warm breath against her cloak, as if to say: <em>Always</em>.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes briefly, pressing her forehead to the wolf’s. Just a moment. Just enough to breathe.</p><p>Then she pulled back, steel snapping into her tone again. “Rest if you must. But we’re not staying here long. Whatever this realm is—it’s not finished with us.”</p><p>Far below, in the dark, the scarecrow’s shadow twitched, stretching its crooked arms higher into the bruised sky.</p><p>——</p><p>The ridge wind howled, cold enough to cut through cloak and skin. Below, the soil-creatures prowled the fields, patient shadows clawing at the boundary line but unable to cross. For now.</p><p>Lilia stood with her arms folded, eyes sharp. “You saw what she did in my cottage. The wards bent. The seam shook. You can pretend otherwise, but without her, there’s no leaving this place.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw locked, violet sparks twitching weakly at her fingertips. “She’s not your key. I will not let you turn her into one of your experiments.”</p><p>Lilia’s voice softened, but the steel remained. “It’s not about me. This realm feeds on our magic, Harkness. Mine. Yours. It will eat us alive before we can even scratch the veil. But her?” Her gaze slid to the black wolf pressed at Agatha’s side. “Her power doesn’t come from this soil. It comes from the moon itself. This place can’t drink it down.”</p><p>Rio shifted, golden eyes lifting to Agatha’s. A low hum rumbled from her chest, not growl, not protest—something steadier.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. She cupped the wolf’s jaw, her fingers sinking into coarse black fur, and for a moment she let herself close her eyes against the weight of it. </p><p>Rio huffed warm against her palm, steady and certain.</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes again, sharp and pained. She looked at Lilia, her voice taut. “If she suffers for this—if you push her past what she can bear—I will tear you apart with my bare hands.”</p><p>Lilia inclined her head once, solemn. “Understood.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, trembling, and dropped her hand back into her cloak. “Then do it. Use her. But only enough to crack the seam. The rest… I’ll handle.”</p><p>The wolf leaned into her, black fur brushing her side, golden eyes steady as if to tell her: <em>You won’t face it alone</em>.</p><p>For the first time since they’d fallen into this cursed place, Agatha’s shoulders sagged with reluctant acceptance. “Very well,” she murmured, softer now. “We’ll play your game. But gods help you, Calderu, if you ever forget she’s not a weapon.”</p><p>Lilia’s lips curved faintly, almost in respect. “Then let’s see if love and moonlight can split a realm wide open.”</p><p>Below, the scarecrow’s grin stretched impossibly wide, its shadow twitching as though it had been waiting for that answer.</p><p>⸻</p><p>Lilia knelt on the stone ridge, drawing her knife once more. This time she carved into the rock itself, her hands steady despite the cold wind tearing at her sleeves. Lines crisscrossed into circles, spirals, crescents — a lunar lattice that began to glow faintly silver as she finished each cut.</p><p>Agatha watched with her arms crossed, her face carved sharp with distrust. “If this harms her—”</p><p>“I know,” Lilia said without looking up. “You’ll make good on your promise. Spare me the threat; I heard it the first time.”</p><p>The last crescent flared to life, silver pooling in the grooves. The circle hummed faintly, its glow reaching upward as if yearning for a sky that held no moon.</p><p>Rio padded closer, black fur bristling, golden eyes fixed on the light. Her chest rumbled with a low, uncertain sound.</p><p>Agatha crouched beside her, a hand pressed to her ruff. Her voice was softer now, meant only for the wolf. “It’s just light and stone. Nothing more. You’ve faced worse than this.”</p><p>Rio huffed, warm against her cheek.</p><p>Lilia straightened, wiping stone dust from her palms. “Have her step inside. The lattice will draw on what’s in her. If it’s strong enough, the seam between cages will show itself. Maybe even a path beyond.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. She guided Rio forward with a gentle pressure to her shoulder. “Stay with me,” she whispered. “Don’t you dare drift away from me.”</p><p>Rio stepped into the circle. The sigils blazed silver at once, the glow rushing up through her paws and flooding her body in veins of light. Her eyes flared molten gold, brighter than before, her growl deepening until it shook the stones beneath them.</p><p>The air thickened, bending.</p><p>Agatha’s cloak whipped around her as sparks bled from her palms. She gritted her teeth. “It’s working—”</p><p>And then the sky split.</p><p>Not wide, not enough to show another world. Just a seam — a jagged tear of pale light above the ridge. The air around it howled, pulling at their cloaks, tugging at their bones as if eager to rip them upward.</p><p>Lilia’s voice rose over the roar, sharp and urgent. “She’s doing it! Hold her steady—don’t let her lose control!”</p><p>Rio snarled, the glow blazing brighter, her black fur haloed with silver fire.</p><p>Agatha threw her arms around her neck, pressing her face into coarse fur. “I’ve got you. I’m here. You’re not alone in this.”</p><p>The seam widened another inch, its light bleeding across the bruised sky. For the first time, Agatha felt the realm itself strain against the force of Rio’s power.</p><p>But below, in the fields, the scarecrow twitched. Its crooked arms creaked upward, its grin widening as the soil-creatures shrieked in chorus — rushing toward the ridge, drawn by the tearing sky.</p><p><br/>The seam tore wider, a jagged streak of silver across the bruised sky. Wind howled out of it, sharp as knives, pulling at cloaks, hair, bone.</p><p>Rio stood braced in the circle, black fur haloed in light, every vein alight with bright light. Her golden eyes blazed, molten and unblinking, but her body trembled under the force ripping through her. A sound tore from her throat — not a growl, not a howl, but something raw, pained, as if the power itself was trying to hollow her out.</p><p>“Hold her steady!” Lilia shouted, runes burning bright up her arms as she tried to reinforce the lattice. “If she falters now, the seam will tear her apart!”</p><p>Agatha dropped to her knees inside the circle, sparks burning wild across her hands as she clutched Rio’s ruff. “You hear me, my love?” she hissed fiercely against the storm. “This doesn’t take you from me. I won’t let it!”</p><p>Rio’s body buckled, claws gouging into stone as the silver light surged again. Her chest heaved, breath ragged, the sound closer to a cry than a growl. For a heartbeat, her golden eyes flickered dim—</p><p>Then the shriek came.</p><p>From below, the soil-creatures swarmed up the ridge, hundreds of them, eyeless and screeching. The scarecrow’s crooked frame lurched, its shadow stretching up the slope as though it climbed with them, grinning wider with every step.</p><p>Lilia flung a burst of searing wards, white fire slicing through the first wave. They fell back to soil, only for more to scramble over their bodies. “They’ll break the circle!” she cried.</p><p>Agatha snapped her head up, eyes burning violet. “Not while I’m breathing!” She flung both arms wide, violet fire arcing out in a wave that slammed the swarm back down the ridge. But the effort dragged her shoulders low, sparks guttering even as her jaw locked stubborn.</p><p>The seam above them shivered, widening by another inch. A faint rush of clean air spilled out, the scent of pine and rain — Salem, so close Agatha’s chest ached.</p><p>But Rio’s body shook violently now, light spilling from her mouth, her eyes, her claws. She threw her head back with a roar that cracked into a sound of pain, and Agatha thought her heart might split with it.</p><p>Agatha wrapped her arms tighter around her neck, her voice breaking. “Stay with me, Rio. Please. You’re not a door, not a weapon—you’re mine. And I need you here.”</p><p>Rio shuddered, the golden fire in her eyes flaring again at the words. She pressed her muzzle against Agatha’s shoulder, just for a heartbeat, before the storm tore at her again.</p><p>The creatures were nearly on them, clawing up the last of the ridge, the scarecrow’s shadow stretching long enough to brush the edge of the circle.</p><p>Lilia’s runes flared, her voice rising in a desperate incantation. “She cannot hold this alone—Agatha, give her your strength or she’ll be consumed!”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. She looked at Rio — trembling, blazing, breaking under the moon’s weight — and without hesitation pressed her forehead to hers, violet fire pouring from her palms into the wolf’s black fur.</p><p>The seam screamed open another foot, the light spilling wide. The soil-creatures shrieked in answer, their bodies writhing as the realm itself strained.</p><p>And at the centre of it, wolf and witch clung together, caught between salvation and ruin.</p><p>Agatha’s violet fire poured from her palms into Rio’s black fur, sparks searing along the lines of silver light already burning through her veins. </p><p>For a heartbeat, Agatha thoght she would burn them both out—two forces colliding, too wild to tether.</p><p>But then—</p><p>They <em>wove</em>.</p><p>The violet fire and the silver moonlight threaded into each other, not clashing but braiding, fusing into something entirely new. Light surged up around them, not Salem’s pale silver, not Agatha’s sharp violet, but a rich, impossible indigo that lit the ridge like dawn breaking over a dead world.</p><p>The soil-creatures froze mid-climb, their eyeless faces turned upward, shrieks cut to silence. Even the scarecrow’s shadow twitched and recoiled, its crooked grin faltering.</p><p>Agatha gasped as the force tore through her, not devouring but expanding, every nerve alight. She felt Rio’s heart hammering against her chest, her breath rushing hot, and beneath it—threads of her own magic interwoven, held steady by the wolf’s unshakable core.</p><p>Rio’s golden eyes flared brighter than the seam itself, molten and alive, as if the moon had dropped into her body whole.</p><p>The sky screamed. The seam ripped wider—not a jagged tear but a path, a perfect arc of indigo light stretching across the bruised heavens. For the first time, it wasn’t just a rift—it was a bridge.</p><p>Lilia staggered back, her mouth parted in shock. The runes burning on her arms flickered uselessly against the enormity of the magic pouring out of them. “Saints…” she whispered. “They’ve done it. Witch and wolf—woven as one.”</p><p>Her voice broke into a breathless murmur, half awe, half fear. “The prophecy. The union of moon and shadow. The gate that even Salem cannot bar…”</p><p>Agatha held Rio’s face between her hands, her forehead pressed to her muzzle, her voice trembling with fierce defiance. “Do you see it, Rio? It’s ours. Not theirs. Not Salem’s. Ours.”</p><p>The wolf huffed, a sound like fire and promise, before loosing a roar that split the sky in two.</p><p>The indigo bridge blazed so bright the whole realm shook. The creatures below collapsed back into soil, wailing. The scarecrow’s shadow shredded like smoke, its grin carved away into nothing.</p><p>And Lilia stared upward, her eyes wide, her voice a whisper carried on the wind. “They’ll either save us all… or bring the end we feared.”</p><p><br/>The indigo light blazed upward, splitting the bruised sky wide. It arched into a bridge — solid, radiant, stretching out across the void, its surface humming with a power that was neither moon nor witch alone, but something born of both.</p><p>Agatha staggered to her feet, her hand still clutching Rio’s ruff. The wolf stood tall beside her, black fur haloed in that strange, impossible glow, golden eyes lit like molten suns. Together they cast long, shimmering shadows across the stone ridge.</p><p>Below, the soil-creatures had fallen silent. The fields rippled with unease, shadows curling back from the light as if in fear. Even the scarecrow’s crooked frame had stilled, its grin torn away, leaving nothing but a sagging, empty burlap sack.</p><p>Lilia stared upward, her face pale and stricken, lips moving as though reciting words she had not spoken in decades. At last her voice broke through, hoarse and trembling:</p><p>“The bridge of indigo… the union of shadow and moonlight. Witch and beast woven as one.” Her eyes widened, brimming with something close to horror. “This is the prophecy.”</p><p>Agatha turned sharply, her jaw tight. “What prophecy?”</p><p>“The one I divined,” Lilia whispered, as if confessing a crime. “The one that Salem branded me a liar for. I saw it — a witch and a creature not of their order would break the gates, a creation that Salem could not bar. And in their wake…” She faltered, her voice dropping lower. “…the end of Salem itself.”</p><p>Her gaze darted between them — Agatha fierce and unyielding, Rio blazing like the moon in wolf’s skin — and for a moment she looked like the witch she once was, shamed, cast out for the vision that now stood living before her.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, violet sparks twitching faintly in her hair. “And for that they exiled you. Called you false.”</p><p>Lilia laughed, bitter and ragged. “I was right. Saints preserve me, I was right. And they feared it enough to bury me in this pit.”</p><p>Agatha turned back to the bridge. The indigo light pulsed beneath her boots as though alive, as though waiting. “If Salem fears us, they were right to.”</p><p>Rio pressed against her side, golden eyes fixed on the radiant path stretching across the sky. She let out a deep huff, low and steady, as if in answer.</p><p>Lilia’s voice dropped, rough with awe. “You’re the ones I saw. Witch and wolf. The prophecy made flesh. You’ll either free us all…” Her gaze darkened, heavy with the weight of her own exile. “…or bring their ruin.”</p><p>Agatha stroked her hand along Rio’s jaw, her own expression fierce with devotion. “Then let Salem tremble. Because I’ll burn with her before I let them take her from me.”</p><p> </p>

<p>The indigo bridge pulsed, light rippling outward like a heartbeat. The air around it shimmered with power, alive, woven of witch and wolf.</p><p>Agatha stood at its edge, one hand buried in Rio’s black fur. The wolf pressed against her side, golden eyes fixed on the luminous path ahead. She gave a low, sharp huff, as though urging her forward.</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “Together, then.”</p><p>She stepped onto the bridge. The surface rippled beneath her boot but held, solid and sure. Rio followed, her massive paws glowing indigo where they touched, her fur haloed in light.</p><p>Behind them, Lilia lingered, eyes wide. “You don’t understand what this means,” she called over the rising hum of magic. “That bridge is prophecy. If you cross it, you risk bringing Salem’s downfall.”</p><p>Agatha half-turned, her violet eyes burning in the glow. “I don’t want Salem to fall.” Her voice was steady, sharp with conviction. “But I want its council to choke on their arrogance. To regret ever casting me out. Ever casting us out.”</p><p>Rio’s golden gaze flicked up at her, a low rumble vibrating in her chest—agreement, vow, promise.</p><p>Lilia’s expression flickered. “Prophecies don’t bend to our wants, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha turned back to the glowing path, her hand never leaving Rio’s fur. “Then they’ll learn what it means to fear the things they tried to bury. Not destruction. Not ruin. Regret.”</p><p>She strode forward, Rio at her side. Lilia hesitated, torn between dread and awe, before stepping onto the bridge after them.</p><p>The cursed land below seethed with creatures, but none could reach. Even the scarecrow’s shadow stilled, its grin erased, cowed by the impossible light.</p><p>Above them stretched the bruised sky, split by indigo radiance. At the bridge’s far end, a blinding glow pulsed—something waiting, alive, whether welcome or not.</p><p>Agatha leaned into Rio’s shoulder, her voice low, fierce, meant only for her. “We’ll make them remember us. That’s enough.”</p><p><br/>Rio padded forward, her massive black form haloed in light, golden eyes fixed ahead. Agatha walked close at her side, her hand buried in the thick fur of her ruff, each step measured and unyielding. Behind them, Lilia followed, her dark cloak snapping in the wind, eyes gleaming with something between awe and vindication.</p><p>As their paws and boots touched the ground before Salem’s walls, the bridge dissolved in a rush of violet-silver light, leaving nothing but stone beneath them.</p><p>The wards guarding the city flared instantly, sigils etched into the gates burning white-hot. A shockwave of power rippled outward, halting them in their tracks.</p><p>Figures emerged through the glow. Cloaked in black and silver, their eyes pale as frost, the High Council of Salem stepped forward.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” their leader, Mora intoned, her staff striking the stone with a crack that echoed through the air. “Lilia Calderu. You were cast out. The wolf is forbidden. Turn back. You will not cross these wards.”</p><p>Agatha lifted her chin, violet sparks flickering faint at her fingertips. “You tried to bar us once before. Yet here I stand.”</p><p>Rio’s golden eyes blazed brighter, her massive body pressing close to Agatha’s, a low growl thrumming like thunder in her chest.</p><p>The council raised their hands, wards flaring to strike—</p><p>And then the air shifted.</p><p>Scarlet flames cut across the white light, snapping through the wards like a blade. From behind the council, Wanda Maximoff stepped into view. Her red cloak flared around her, her eyes sharp as fire.</p><p>“Enough,” she said, her voice carrying with unshakable command. “Lower your wards.”</p><p>The council faltered. One of them hissed, “Maximoff—what are you doing? You serve the Archives, not these exiles.”</p><p>“And as Keeper of the Archives,” Wanda snapped, scarlet fire twisting up her arms, “I know the law better than any of you. You do not strike without cause. You do not condemn without proof. Agatha Harkness and her companions stand here under their own power. They will be heard.”</p><p>A ripple of unease moved through the council. Wanda had always been one of their most respected. To ignore her was to undermine their own order.</p><p>Agatha’s voice cut sharp through the silence. “And Lilia Calderu stands with me. You exiled her for a prophecy you swore false—yet here you are, trembling because it walks to your door. She belongs here as much as I do.”</p><p>The council members shifted, their certainty cracking under the weight of Wanda’s authority and Agatha’s fire.</p><p>Rio lowered her head, pressing her muzzle briefly against Agatha’s hip, a steady growl vibrating in her chest like a vow.</p><p><br/>The wards blazed brigfhter, the council standing rigid in their cloaks of black and silver. Power vibrated in the air, ready to strike — until Wanda Maximoff stepped forward, scarlet fire curling up her arms.</p><p>“That's enough,” she said, her voice ringing against the stone. “I’ve seen what they’ve done. What <em>she</em> has done.” Her gaze swept over Rio, black-furred and steady at Agatha’s side. </p><p>“Agatha Harkness and the wolf defeated the Queen of the Crag. They bled for Salem while you hid behind wards. They saved this city from being dragged into ruin.”</p><p>The council faltered, their murmur like the hiss of disturbed snakes.</p><p>Wanda pressed forward, fire brightening with her words. “And this is how you greet them? At our gates with threats? We should be welcoming them like heroes.”</p><p>Mora’s staff struck the stone, her voice cold. “Heroes? You speak of prophecy made flesh, Maximoff. Moon and shadow together herald Salem’s fall.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flashed, but Wanda cut in, her tone sharp as a blade. “You fear what you don’t control, what you don’t <em>understand.</em> That is your failing, not theirs.”</p><p>The wards flickered at her words, light shivering as though the city itself remembered the battle of Elandrel.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer to Rio, her hand pressing firm into her ruff, violet sparks faintly alive across her fingers. </p><p>“You heard her. We’ve both bled for this place. More than you’ve dared. We didn’t come here to destroy Salem. But we will not bow for being cast out.”</p><p>Lilia’s voice slid in, sharp as glass. “And you called <em>me</em> a liar for seeing it. You buried the truth in exile. Well, here it stands, breathing before your eyes.”</p><p>The council members shifted, their certainty cracking. The leader’s pale gaze flicked from Wanda’s fire to Agatha’s sparks, then to Rio’s molten eyes glowing steady in the dark.</p><p>At last, Mora’s staff lowered. Her words were measured, but steel ran through them “Very well. Enter. But know this— if the wolf brings Salem to ruin, the council will not act alone. The blame will be yours, Harkness and Calderu. And yours, Maximoff. You will share her fate.”</p><p>The wards peeled back reluctantly, opening a narrow path into Salem.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth curved, sharp and defiant. “Then so be it. If she falls, we fall with her. That’s the vow you fear most.”</p><p>Rio’s growl thrummed like thunder, steady and unyielding, as the three if them crossed the threshold.</p><p><br/>The iron gates creaked open with a groan that echoed through the ward-lit streets. Agatha stepped forward first, Rio a looming shadow of black fur and golden fire at her side, Lilia and Wanda following close behind.</p><p>Salem’s cobblestones stretched ahead, narrow streets lined with tall, dark houses whose windows already filled with pale faces. Lanterns guttered. Doors cracked open.</p><p>The murmurs started at once.</p><p>“Witch and wolf…”<br/>“She changed…”<br/>“Monster…”</p><p>Rio moved steadily, each paw striking the stone with quiet weight, her fur bristling against the press of so many eyes. Agatha kept one hand in her ruff, her other hand curled, sparks spitting faint and violet at her fingertips — a warning to anyone who thought to step closer.</p><p>They turned down the crooked lane that led toward Agatha’s house. The crowd swelled, witches in simple clothes pressed against the walls and steps, eyes wide, voices sharp with fear. Children clung to their mothers’ skirts.</p><p>And still, Rio kept her head high.</p><p>Until—</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>A high, bright voice pierced the murmur. Before the crowd could react, a small shape darted through their legs. </p><p>Cora.</p><p>Her curls bounced as she ran full tilt into the street, straight toward the wolf towering above the crowd.</p><p>Gasps rippled through the villagers. “No!” someone cried. “Get her back!”</p><p>But Rio had already dropped into a crouch, her golden eyes softening. The massive wolf bent low, lowering her head until Cora crashed into her neck with fearless arms.</p><p>Rio’s chest rumbled, not with threat but with something warm and steady. She nuzzled gently against the girl’s cheek, her black fur swallowing Cora’s small frame as the child laughed into her ruff.</p><p>The crowd fell into stunned silence.</p><p>One woman whispered, “That’s Calderu’s granddaughter—”<br/>Another voice: “But the wolf… she saved her, didn’t she? At the market…”</p><p><br/>The murmurs shifted. Fear cracked, turning into awe, into remembering.</p><p>Agatha’s violet eyes swept the crowd, her voice low but sharp enough to carry. “You see? Even your children remember who saved you, when your council would have let you burn.”</p><p>No one answered. But for the first time, they didn’t look at Rio with terror — they looked at her with the ghost of something else.</p><p>Respect.</p><p><br/>The crowd stayed hushed, their eyes fixed on the impossible sight of Cora clinging to Rio’s ruff. The girl’s laughter softened the air, chasing out the sharp edge of fear.</p><p>But Lilia had gone very still. Her gaze lingered on Cora, not with fear, but with something else — a flicker of recognition, sharp and raw.</p><p>“She looks just like…” she whispered to herself.</p><p>The murmurs rippled again as another figure pushed through the gathering. A woman in her thirties, her cloak plain but her bearing proud. Her face caught the torchlight, and Lilia’s breath faltered.</p><p>“Althea,” Lilia gasped, her voice breaking like a spell.</p><p>The woman stopped short, staring hard at her. “You…” Her eyes searched Lilia’s face, disbelief etched in every line. “It can’t be.”</p><p>“It is,” Lilia said, her throat tight. She stepped forward, almost hesitant, as if afraid the woman would vanish. “My Althea. My little girl…”</p><p>The crowd seemed to disappear around them. Althea’s expression wavered, her voice trembling as she whispered, “Mother?”</p><p>Lilia let out a sharp, broken sound — half laugh, half sob — as tears welled in her eyes. “Yes. Oh, saints, yes.”</p><p>Althea closed the last step between them, and Lilia folded her into her arms, clutching her daughter like she might never let go. Decades of exile melted away in a single, trembling embrace.</p><p>Cora, still clinging to Rio, blinked wide-eyed at the scene. “Mama?”</p><p>Althea pulled back just enough to cup her daughter’s cheek, her tears streaking her smile. “Cora, this is your grandmother.”</p><p>The little girl’s mouth dropped open in awe. “Grandmother?”</p><p>Lilia dropped to her knees, her hands shaking as she reached out. “Yes, my sweet one. My Cora.”</p><p>Cora slipped free of Rio’s fur and bounded to her, throwing small arms around Lilia’s neck without hesitation. “I have a grandmother?”</p><p>Lilia clutched her tight, burying her face against the child’s curls, her voice breaking. “You do. I have dreamed about you. And I love you more than the moon itself.”</p><p>The villagers murmured louder now, but not in fear. Wonder rippled through the crowd as prophecy, exile, and reunion unfolded before their eyes.</p><p>Agatha stood with Rio at her side, watching the embrace. Her chest softened despite herself. She leaned into the wolf’s shoulder, her voice low enough only Rio could hear. “That’ll rattle them more than any prophecy ever could.”</p><p>Rio’s golden eyes glowed warm, her chest vibrating with a soft, approving rumble.</p><p> </p><p>The door creaked open on worn hinges, and the familiar smell of dried herbs and ash spilled out to greet them. Agatha stepped across the threshold first, her boots echoing softly on the wood. Rio followed, her paws heavy against the floorboards, head turning as though to drink in every corner of the space.</p><p>It was dim inside, but alive with memory: shelves lined with books and jars, the hearth cold but waiting, the table still scarred where Agatha had once carved sigils deep into the wood. After so long away — and everything they’d endured — the little house felt impossibly whole.</p><p>Wanda slipped in behind them, closing the door on Salem’s murmuring streets. She lingered near the wall, her shoulders tense, before finally letting out a long, shaky breath. </p><p>“When I stepped through the portal back to Salem,” she began quietly, her voice low, “I felt it at once — the rejection. The wards knew you weren’t welcome, Agatha. And they recoiled harder still at Rio. Like the city itself was spitting you both out.”</p><p>Agatha stiffened, her jaw tightening. She turned slightly, her blue eyes cutting toward Wanda.</p><p>Wanda pressed on. “I tried to find you — I searched the wards, the ley-lines, the gaps. But you were gone. Lost to the void. I thought…” Her words faltered, breaking into silence.</p><p>Agatha’s chest softened, just slightly, the sting of her own exile pressed against Wanda’s admission.</p><p>And then Wanda stepped forward. Without hesitation, without calculation. She wrapped her arms around Agatha — awkward at first, unpracticed, but real.</p><p>For the first time, Wanda Maximoff hugged her.</p><p>Agatha froze, her body taut with shock, until slowly, against all her own instincts, she let her hand rest against Wanda’s back. A brief, silent truce in the shadows of her home.</p><p>Across the room, Rio shifted. Her black fur shimmered, bones cracking and reforming in sharp rhythm, until she was herself again — tall, human, dark-haired,  she sank onto the hearth, curling into herself with the same quiet weight as before.</p><p>Her golden eyes, dimmed now but still glimmering faintly, lifted to meet Agatha’s. Her voice came soft, rasping from the strain, but certain as stone.</p><p>“Home.”</p><p>The word hung in the air, a vow, a release, a truth.</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. She looked from Wanda’s embrace to Rio by her hearth, human again but still haloed in that fierce, impossible presence — and for the first time in longer than she dared admit, she allowed herself to believe it.</p><p>They were home.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>The copper basin steamed by the hearth, herbs curling fragrant smoke into the small room. Agatha had filled it with a flick of her fingers, the water shimmering with violet sparks before settling warm. She untied her cloak and draped it over a chair, her gaze cutting back to Rio.</p><p>The wolf-girl still lingered by the chair where she had collapsed, a blanket pulled loose around her body. Her golden eyes flicked from the bath to Agatha, unsure.</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, her voice softer than her words. “Don’t look at me like that. You need it as much as I do. More, in fact.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth pulled into the faintest, crooked smile. She rose slowly, every movement heavy, and followed Agatha to the tub. When Agatha stepped in, Rio hesitated a beat, then joined her.</p><p>The water lapped at their shoulders, heat sinking deep into aching muscle. For a long moment, there was only the quiet sound of water shifting and their breaths evening out.</p><p>Agatha leaned back, her eyes half-closed, feeling some of the tension bleed from her spine for the first time in weeks. Then she felt it — a hesitant brush against her hand. She opened her eyes to find Rio watching her.</p><p>“Warm,” Rio murmured, her voice rough with strain, the words broken but determined. “Good… with you.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved despite herself. “With me, hm?” She turned her hand over and threaded her fingers through Rio’s, guiding their joined hands beneath the water.</p><p>Rio’s golden eyes softened. She tilted closer, her damp hair clinging to her cheeks, and whispered haltingly, “Me… learn. Words… for Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. She reached up with her free hand, brushing her knuckles gently against Rio’s cheek. “You’ve already said more than I deserve.”</p><p>Rio leaned into the touch, closing her eyes briefly. When she opened them again, she shifted closer, so close Agatha could feel the heat of her breath over the steam. Her broken English caught awkwardly in her mouth, but her meaning was clear.</p><p>“Home… here,” Rio whispered, her hand pressing softly against Agatha’s chest. Then, shyly, she corrected herself. “You. Home… is you.”</p><p>Agatha’s sharp laugh caught in her throat, breaking into something softer, more fragile. She leaned in, closing the small space, and pressed her lips to Rio’s in a kiss that was tender, almost trembling, carrying every ounce of exhaustion, defiance, and love that words couldn’t hold.</p><p>Rio made a low sound — half growl, half sigh — and kissed her back with clumsy earnestness, her fingers clutching tight to Agatha’s hand beneath the water.</p><p>When they broke apart, Agatha rested her forehead against hers, whispering, “Sweet fool. You’ll undo me.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly, golden eyes glowing even in the dim light. “Good.”</p><p>Agatha laughed again, soft this time, and kissed her once more, slow and certain, as the water steamed around them.</p><p><br/>The water lapped quietly against the basin’s rim as Agatha deepened the kiss, slow and searching. Her hand slid along Rio’s cheek, thumb brushing damp skin, while their joined hands remained tangled beneath the water.</p><p>Rio shifted clumsily, leaning closer until her body pressed against Agatha’s beneath the surface. The heat of her skin and the unsteady eagerness of her kiss made Agatha’s chest ache with something fierce and protective all at once.</p><p>When they finally parted for air, Rio’s breath came uneven, her lips curved into a small, shy smile. She searched for words, the strain of forming them clear, but she pushed them out anyway. “I… love. You.”</p><p>The brokenness of it made it sharper, purer than any fluent confession.</p><p>Agatha’s blue eyes softened, her hand rising to cradle the back of Rio’s neck. She pressed her lips to her temple, her voice low, trembling despite her control. “And I love you, fool wolf.”</p><p>Rio huffed softly, a pleased sound like a purr caught in her throat, and pressed her face into Agatha’s shoulder. Her hands, uncertain but reverent, skimmed over Agatha’s arms, her back, as though learning her all over again.</p><p>Agatha let her, her body loosening into the embrace. She tipped Rio’s chin up and kissed her again — slower, lingering, coaxing rather than demanding. The taste of her was warm, alive, carrying the earth and moonlight both.</p><p>The water shifted as Rio pulled her closer, awkward at first, but with an eagerness that made Agatha laugh softly against her lips. “Careful,” she teased, breathless. “You’ll spill half the bath before you’ve even begun.”</p><p>Rio’s golden eyes glowed in the dim light, her answer halting but certain. “No care. Only… you.”</p><p>Agatha's eyes gleamed with a mix of mischief and hunger as she leaned back against the tub’s edge, the water lapping at her collarbones. Rio hovered above her, trembling with the effort of restraint, her golden eyes dark with need.</p><p>“Come here,” Agatha murmured, her fingers trailing along Rio’s jaw, then down her neck. “Let me take care of you.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched at the words. She shifted, kneeling over Agatha so their bodies were nearly aligned, her hardness bobbing just bleow the water’s surface.</p><p>Agatha hummed approvingly and reached down, her fingers curling around Rio’s length. The wolf girl jolted, a low growl rumbling in her chest as Agatha began to stroke her slowly, her palm slick from the bathwater.</p><p>“So eager,” Agatha teased, her voice soft but edged with something darker. “Always so ready to fall apart for me.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers dug into the tub’s rim, her gaze fixed on Agatha’s face as if it were her only anchor. She didn’t speak—words were beyond her now—but her eyes spoke volumes, pleading and proud at once.</p><p>Agatha tightened her grip just slightly, her thumb brushing over the head of Rio’s cock with each upward stroke. The wolf girl trembled, her hips rocking involuntarily into the touch.</p><p>“Look at you,” Agatha whispered, her free hand coming up to cup Rio’s face. “Falling to pieces already. And we’ve barely begun.”</p><p>Rio whined softly, the sound barely human, and Agatha’s smirk widened. She leaned forward, pressing a slow, deliberate kiss to Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“Patience, darling,” she murmured against Rio’s skin, her lips trailing up to her neck. “I intend to enjoy this.”</p><p>Rio shuddered, her head dropping forward until her forehead pressed against Agatha’s. Her breath was hot against Agatha’s cheek, quick and ragged.</p><p>Agatha began to stroke faster now, her grip firm and sure. She watched Rio’s face, memorising every twitch of her brow, every parting of her lips, every crack in her composure.</p><p>“Gods, you’re beautiful like this,” Agatha breathed, honest reverence bleeding into her words. “All yours, all mine.”</p><p>Rio growled again, the sound fractured, and her hips snapped forward, seeking more friction. Agatha obliged, her hand working faster, harder, as she used her other hand to drag her nails lightly down Rio’s spine.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio managed, her voice broken. </p><p>“Soon,” Agatha promised, her lips brushing Rio’s ear. “When you’re begging for it.”</p><p>Rio groaned, her body trembling with the effort to hold back. Her fingers scrabbled at the tub’s edge, water splashing over the rim with her frantic movements.</p><p>Agatha tightened her fist just a fraction more, her pace unrelenting now. She could feel Rio’s cock swelling, could see the way her body tensed, muscles bunching beneath her skin.</p><p>“Go on,” Agatha urged, her voice a low, liquid purr. “Fall apart for me, darling.”</p><p>And with a choked cry, Rio did. Her body arched, her hips thrusting into Agatha’s grip as she came. Agatha coaxed her through it, her hand slowing but not stopping until Rio slumped forward, boneless and panting.</p><p>Agatha pressed a soft kiss to her temple. “Good girl,” she whispered. “Now it’s my turn.”</p><p>She maneuvered Rio until they were both seated in the tub, Agatha straddling Rio’s lap. The water cooled against their skin, but neither noticed. Agatha reached between them, aligning herself with Rio’s still-hard length, and sank down in one smooth motion.</p><p>Rio gasped, her arms wrapping instinctively around Agatha’s waist. “Agatha—” she started, but Agatha silenced her with a kiss, deep and demanding.</p><p>“Shh,” she murmured against Rio's lips. “Just feel.”</p><p>And Rio did. She felt Agatha moving above her, water lapping around them, each rise and fall of her hips driving her deeper into bliss. Agatha's violet eyes never left hers, even as her own breath grew ragged, her movements less controlled.</p><p>They rocked together, the tub creaking under their combined weight, but neither cared about the precariousness of their sanctuary. The world could break around them, but here, in this moment, they were safe. They were whole. They were each other's, utterly and completely.</p><p>Agatha's nails dug into Rio's shoulders as she rode her harder, faster, chasing the peak that promised oblivion. Rio met her thrust for thrust, her own pleasure building anew at the sight of Agatha coming undone.</p><p>“With me,” Agatha gasped, her voice tight with need. “Come with me, Rio.”</p><p>And as Agatha's body tightened, her muscles clenching around her, Rio followed, her own release crashing over her like a wave. They clung to each other, breath mingling, hearts pounding as one, until the last tremors faded and the water stilled.</p><p>In the silence afterward, Agatha pressed her forehead to Rio's, her eyes closed, a soft smile on her lips. Rio wrapped her arms tighter around her, holding her close as if to keep her from ever slipping away.</p><p>“Always yours,” she whispered, the words as much a vow as a statement of fact.</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes, her gaze warm and soft in a way she rarely allowed herself. “Always mine,” she echoed, her voice barely audible.</p><p><br/>When the urgency eased, they stayed close in the cooling bath, Rio leaning against the edge, Agatha curled into her chest, damp hair clung to her cheek, her breathing heavy but content.</p><p>Agatha stroked her collarbone, her voice quiet, almost lost in the steam. “Do you know… I’ve thought about it. If somehow… we ever had a child.”</p><p>Rio stirred, blinking down at her, puzzled. “Child?” she repeated softly.</p><p>Agatha nodded, brushing her hair back from her forehead. “A baby. Yours and mine.”</p><p>Rio’s golden eyes widened. She searched Agatha’s face, unsure. “Ba… baby?”</p><p>Agatha gave a breath of a laugh, shaking her head. “Yes. Foolish, isn’t it? You’ve had enough to carry without me filling your head with that.”</p><p>But Rio’s hand found hers under the water, squeezing it tightly. Her brow furrowed as if shaping the right words, then she whispered, simple and sure: “Stay. Always.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. She kissed her, soft and lingering, her voice trembling against her lips. “Sweet fool. You’ll undo me yet.”</p><p>The water lapped around them, cooling, but the warmth they held between them did not fade.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>The scent of herbs still lingered faintly from the bath, mingling with ash and old wood. </p><p><em>Home</em>, she thought, but the word felt fragile, like a spell she didn’t dare test in case it broke.</p><p>Rio curled on the rug before the hearth, wrapped in a fresh linen night shirt and pants. Her damp hair clung to her cheeks, her golden eyes dimmer now but still watching her with that fierce, unwavering trust. When her head found Agatha’s thigh, settling there as if it belonged, Agatha’s chest clenched tight. She smoothed her fingers through Rio’s hair, the strands coarse from drying but warm against her skin.</p><p>How many nights had she imagined never seeing this again? How many times had she cursed herself for dragging Rio into Salem’s shadows at all? The council called her exile. The prophecy called her ruin. But here she was, alive and breathing, curled against Agatha as if she were safe. </p><p><em>As if I were worth trusting</em>.</p><p>Agatha reached for a book on the low table, one she hadn’t opened in years. Its cover was worn, its corners bent, the pages filled with the kind of tales she used to scoff at. Now, she wasn’t sure who she meant to comfort — Rio, or herself.</p><p>“Since you refuse to sleep,” she murmured, letting sarcasm soften her own rawness, “I suppose I’ll have to bore you into it.”</p><p>Rio only made a low, pleased sound in her throat, pressing her face into Agatha’s hip. Agatha’s lips twitched despite herself. Fool creature. Sweet, foolish creature.</p><p>She opened the book, her voice steadying as she began to read aloud. The words were simple, rolling evenly in the warm air. A tale of a traveler who lost her way in the forest and found her path again by following the cry of a wolf. Too fitting, really. <em>The universe does love its cruel little jokes.</em></p><p>Rio’s breathing shifted as she listened. Sometimes she hummed — a low sound of amusement, or a puzzled noise when she didn’t understand a word. Each time, Agatha paused, smoothing her hair, explaining in patient whispers she didn’t think herself capable of. </p><p><em>When did I start softening like this</em>?</p><p>After a while, Rio’s sounds stopped. Agatha looked down and found her eyes closed, her mouth parted in the ease of sleep, her hand curled into the edge of Agatha’s nightdress like it was an anchor.</p><p>Agatha kept reading anyway, though her voice dropped to almost a whisper. She traced her fingers over Rio’s temple, letting the story fill the silence that might otherwise collapse under everything unsaid.</p><p>Her chest ached with something dangerous. Relief. Love. Fear. All tangled. </p><p>
<em>What if Salem takes her from me? What if the prophecy is right?</em>
</p><p>She glanced to the window, the wards faintly pulsing against the glass. Salem was watching, always watching. But here, in this small circle of firelight, Rio breathed softly against her, unafraid.</p><p>Agatha closed the book at last, her voice catching in her throat as she whispered to herself more than to her sleeping wolf: “Home.”</p><p>The word felt steadier this time. Less fragile. As though Rio’s presence made it true.</p><p><br/>⸻</p><p>The fire had burned down to embers during the night, filling the house with a comfortable hush. Agatha had dozed upright in her chair, one hand tangled loosely in Rio’s dark hair where the wolf-girl slept curled against her legs. For the first time in weeks, her dreams had been quiet.</p><p>The peace shattered with a sudden <em>bang bang bang</em> at the door.</p><p>“Rio!” Cora’s bright voice rang through the wood. “Rio, are you in there? It’s me!”</p><p>Agatha startled awake, blinking into the grey light of morning that spilled through the shutters. Rio stirred with a low groan, golden brown eyes fluttering open. When the knock came again — louder, impatient — Rio sat up fully, head cocked, the corner of her mouth tugging in something close to a smile.</p><p>Agatha sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “The child’s lungs could wake the dead.”</p><p>She pushed herself up and opened the door. Sure enough, there was Cora, curls wild, eyes blazing with delight. And behind her, a figure Agatha hadn’t expected so soon — Lilia.</p><p>The older witch carried a bottle of deep red wine tucked under one arm. Her expression was taut, but her eyes softened when they fell on Agatha.</p><p>“For you,” Lilia said simply, offering the bottle. “A thank you — for bringing me back. For… letting me see them again.”</p><p>Agatha took the bottle, her brows rising faintly. “Wine before breakfast?”</p><p>A sharp smile flickered over Lilia’s mouth. “After decades in the void, I’d call it overdue.” Then her gaze shifted past Agatha, toward the hearth.</p><p>Inside, Cora had already darted across the room. She flung herself onto the rug beside Rio, who crouched to meet her with a low, delighted huff. The girl began to chatter at once — breathless stories tumbling over each other, about how she’d told everyone Rio was good, how she’d begged to come first thing in the morning, how she’d dreamed of wolves running under the moon.</p><p>Rio didn’t interrupt. She didn’t speak. She only listened, golden eyes soft, a smile tugging at her mouth as she tilted her head to catch every word. From time to time she nodded, or made a low hum of encouragement, as if nothing mattered more than Cora’s rambling.</p><p>Lilia’s eyes lingered on them — her granddaughter speaking rapid-fire to the wolf-girl who had become her protector. Her face was steady, but her voice dipped softer when she finally said, “I have a lot of lost time to make up for.”</p><p>Agatha followed her gaze, watching Rio bow her head so Cora could loop a ribbon into her dark hair. The witch’s chest tightened despite herself. “Then I suggest you start now,” she murmured. “She seems willing to listen.”</p><p>For a rare moment, all three women fell silent, the house filled only with the sound of Cora’s bright chatter — and Rio’s soft, patient smile.</p><p><br/>Agatha leaned against the table, arms folded, watching the picture with a sharp ache in her chest. <em>This is what they’ll never understand, she thought bitterly. She is no monster. She is—</em></p><p>A quiet voice at her shoulder broke the thought.</p><p>“You care for her more deeply than I knew possible,” Lilia murmured, her eyes not leaving the pair at the fire. “More than any banished witch should dare to.”</p><p>Agatha’s sapphire eyes flicked toward her. “I don’t dare,” she said simply. “I just do.”</p><p>Lilia was silent for a long moment. Then her voice dropped, softer, almost reluctant. “Be careful, Agatha. Prophecies are never as the council claims. They twist, they bind. Sometimes… the danger isn’t in the wolf, or the witch, but in what they create together.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed, her lips parting as though to demand more — but Lilia only shook her head, gaze fixed on Cora’s laughter.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Agatha pressed, her tone sharp despite her whisper.</p><p>“Not now,” Lilia said. Her jaw tightened, and for the first time, she looked almost afraid. “You’ll know soon enough.”</p><p>By the hearth, Cora clapped her hands, delighted as Rio bent forward and made a playful growl, shaking her hair until the flower tumbled loose. The child squealed with laughter, throwing her arms around Rio’s neck without hesitation.</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. She tore her gaze from Lilia, forcing her face smooth. “She’s not Salem’s downfall,” she whispered fiercely. “She’s my salvation.”</p><p>Lilia did not answer. She only looked at Agatha with something unreadable in her dark eyes, as if pity warred with awe, and kept her silence.</p><p><br/>Lilia’s gaze then lingered on Rio, her mouth curved in something that was half a smile, half disbelief. “She’s softer than I expected,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched. “You should’ve seen her last week — chewing pinecones. This is practically refined.”</p><p>Lilia gave a short laugh, but it caught in her throat as she watched Cora press another flower into Rio’s hair. The wolf-girl bowed her head obediently, her expression patient, as if nothing mattered more than indulging the child.</p><p>For a long moment Lilia didn’t speak. Then, almost hesitantly, she said, “You should come to us. Tonight. To share a meal.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard. “A meal?”</p><p>Lilia nodded. “With me. With my daughter. With Cora.” Her voice steadied as she went on, though the hope in it was unmistakable. “I’ve missed thirty years of family suppers. I can’t replace them, but I can start again. And I’d like you both there.”</p><p>By the hearth, Cora gasped with delight. “Yes! Please, Agatha, please bring Rio! She has to come!”</p><p>Rio looked up at Agatha then, almost uncertain, as though waiting for her cue.</p><p>Agatha sighed, though her chest betrayed her with a warmth she couldn’t smother. “Seems your granddaughter is very persuasive,” she said dryly.</p><p>But Lilia only smiled, something softer lighting her face. “So you’ll come.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curved into a small, quiet smile. “Come,” she echoed, the word halting but certain.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, muttering under her breath, “Saints preserve me.” But she didn’t say no.</p><p><br/>⸻</p><p>The late afternoon light slanted through the shutters, painting long bars of gold across the floorboards. Agatha stood at the foot of her bed, sleeves rolled, a pile of carefully chosen clothes laid out before her like a battlefield.</p><p>Rio sat on the edge of the mattress, hair still damp from washing, watching her with wary eyes. She tugged at the collar of the cream shirt Agatha had just forced her into, the buttons askew from clumsy fingers.</p><p>“Too… tight,” Rio muttered, tugging again.</p><p>Agatha smacked her hand away and redid the top buttons with brisk precision. “It’s supposed to fit, not hang off you like a scarecrow’s castoff.” She smoothed the fabric across Rio’s shoulders, lips twitching despite her sternness. “Cream suits you. Almost makes you look respectable.”</p><p>Rio gave her a flat look, which only deepened when Agatha shoved a pair of fitted black trousers into her hands.</p><p>“On,” Agatha ordered.</p><p>Grumbling under her breath in a mix of broken English and growls, Rio obeyed. The fabric hugged her legs, showing off long, lean muscle. Agatha pretended not to notice her own throat tightening as she fetched a pair of white stockings and black dress shoes.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio groaned, pulling at the unfamiliar fabric.</p><p>“Don’t whine. You’ll survive.” Agatha knelt, rolling the stockings up her calves with deliberate slowness. Her fingers lingered a second too long, and when she glanced up, Rio’s golden eyes were fixed on her, glowing softly in the dim light. Agatha cleared her throat, stood briskly, and reached for the final weapon.</p><p>The shoes.</p><p>Rio’s expression soured instantly. “No.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“feet…”</p><p>Agatha planted her hands on her hips. “Bare feet at dinner? With stockings? Not in this century, darling.” She shoved the shoes at her until Rio, huffing like a scolded hound, finally jammed them on. She flexed her toes miserably, and Agatha smirked. “There. Presentable.”</p><p>Rio rumbled a growl, but Agatha only patted her cheek sweetly.</p><p>Then she turned to her own gown.</p><p>She let the fabric fall over her shoulders — deep violet, rich as wine, with sleeves that bared her collarbones and a line that hugged her waist before spilling into flowing skirts. She hadn’t worn it in years, but when she fastened the last clasp and lifted her chin to the mirror, she allowed herself the faintest smile. <em>Still fits</em>.</p><p>When she stepped out, Rio was tugging sulkily at her shoes again — until she looked up.</p><p>The air shifted.</p><p>Rio froze, golden eyes widening, the shirt half-unbuttoned from her fiddling. She stared as if seeing her for the first time, her lips parting soundlessly.</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, fighting the warmth rising in her chest. “What? Lost your words now?”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, a smile tugging clumsy at her mouth. “…Beautiful,” she whispered, the word halting, almost reverent.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha’s composure nearly cracked. She looked away too quickly, smoothing her skirts. “Hmph. Don’t crease your shirt before we even arrive.”</p><p><br/>Rio hadn’t stopped staring. The ribbon still sat crooked in her dark hair, and the cream shirt pulled snug across her shoulders, but her golden eyes were fixed on Agatha like she was the only thing in existence.</p><p>When Agatha turned toward the door, smoothing her skirts as if to compose herself, Rio rose slowly from the bed. Her steps were quiet, deliberate.</p><p>“Rio—” Agatha began, but the name broke off into a sharp breath as strong arms circled her waist.</p><p>Rio bent low, nuzzling into the hollow of her neck, her lips brushing the soft skin just beneath Agatha’s jaw. A low hum rolled from her chest, deep and pleased, as she pressed slow kisses along her throat.</p><p>Agatha gasped, then—against her will—let out a helpless giggle. “You absolute menace.” Her hand came up to push at Rio’s shoulder, though she didn’t push very hard.</p><p>Rio only growled softly in answer, pawing at her with playful urgency, her kisses growing bolder as she nosed under the line of her collar.</p><p>“Stop—stop, we don’t have time,” Agatha laughed breathlessly, wriggling against her grip. She caught Rio’s face in her hands and pressed her back just enough to meet her glowing eyes. “Darling, if you keep this up you’ll arrive at dinner with a bulge between your legs, and I’ll not spend the entire evening pretending not to notice.”</p><p>Rio paused, blinking, then gave her a wicked little grin that made Agatha’s heart lurch.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and finally pushed her back firmly, though her lips were still curved with laughter. “Later,” she promised, smoothing her gown again with deliberate fuss. “Behave until then.”</p><p>Rio huffed, half sulk and half amusement, but the glow in her golden eyes said she’d carry the promise close all evening.</p><p>⸻</p><p><br/>The streets of Salem buzzed with whispers as Agatha and Rio made their way through. Witches peered from shuttered windows, their voices low, their eyes darting to the wolf-girl forced into shoes and stockings, a crooked ribbon still stubbornly knotted in her dark hair. Agatha walked tall at her side, violet skirts swaying, her chin high as though daring anyone to speak.</p><p>Rio leaned close once, her shoulder brushing Agatha’s, and whispered clumsily, “Later.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched. “Behave,” she hissed under her breath, though her eyes softened with amusement she couldn’t hide.</p><p>By the time they reached Lilia’s home, the sun had dipped low, casting the crooked eaves of the old house in gold. Lanterns burned warm in the windows. The door opened before they could knock, and Cora’s excited voice shrieked, “Rio!” before the child flung herself at her.</p><p>Rio crouched immediately, scooping her up with a smile that made the gathered whispers outside the house falter.</p><p>Althea appeared behind her daughter, her eyes cautious but not unkind. “Come in,” she said, voice steady though her gaze lingered on Rio with something unreadable. “Dinner’s ready.”</p><p>Inside, the house was alive with warmth — herbs drying along the beams, bread baking in the oven, the table set with care. It was smaller than Agatha’s home but filled with the pulse of family.</p><p>Lilia stood at the head of the table, a bottle of wine already opened, her expression sharp but softened by the sight of her granddaughter perched in Rio’s lap as though she’d belonged there all her life.</p><p>“Sit,” Lilia commanded, pouring the wine. “Eat. Tonight we’re not council or prophecy, just family.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow at the word<em> family</em> but said nothing. She allowed herself to sit beside Rio, her skirts brushing against her trousers, and when Rio looked at her out of the corner of her golden eyes, Agatha let herself smile — just faintly, but enough to make Rio’s breath hitch.</p><p>The scent of roasted meat, fresh bread, and herbs filled the room. For the first time since returning to Salem, the air felt more like welcome than warning.</p><p><br/>The table was laid with more food than Rio had seen in months — roasted pork, warm bread, stewed greens fragrant with herbs. Cora tugged at her sleeve until Rio sat with her, and the girl immediately began piling slices of bread onto her plate as though she might starve if Rio didn’t eat.</p><p>Rio picked up the bread with her hands first, tearing off a piece with sharp teeth.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat pointedly.</p><p>Rio froze. Across the table, Lilia smirked knowingly as she sipped her wine. Althea kept her eyes on her plate, though Agatha noticed the faintest twitch of her lips.</p><p>Rio reluctantly reached for the fork. She turned it over once, fumbled with it, then managed to scoop a piece of pork. The bite made it to her mouth, but not without a clatter that made Cora giggle.</p><p>“Good,” Rio said firmly chewing and Cora clapped as though she’d just performed magic.</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched, torn between pride and exasperation. “Yes, darling, you’re very civillized,” she murmured, dabbing at a drop of broth that had landed on Rio’s cuff.</p><p>Rio shot her a shy grin, crooked and pleased.</p><p>The meal carried on in fits of chatter — Cora asking Rio endless questions, Rio nodding solemnly or offering single, careful words in reply. Althea spoke little, though her gaze kept flicking between her daughter and the wolf-girl at her side.</p><p>At last, when the laughter had softened and the meal slowed, Agatha leaned back, cradling her wine glass, and asked quietly, “And Cora’s father?”</p><p>The question made the table fall briefly still. Althea’s fingers tightened around her cup, but after a long pause, she answered.</p><p>“He was a fisherman,” she said, her voice steady but low. “His ship went down in a storm before Cora was born. He never knew her.”</p><p>Cora, oblivious to the heaviness in her mother’s tone, chattered brightly to Rio about how she wanted to see the sea one day. Rio bent her head, listening intently, nodding as though the child’s every word was a secret worth guarding.</p><p>Agatha let her eyes linger on Althea, then lowered them back to her wine. “I see,” she murmured. And though she said no more, she felt the weight of it — Lilia’s lost years, Althea’s loss, and Cora’s laughter carrying them all forward regardless.</p><p>The firelight flickered across Rio’s face as she leaned closer to Cora, golden eyes glowing warm, and Agatha thought: <em>If Salem could see her like this, they’d never call her ruin again</em>.</p><p><br/>The meal had dwindled down to comfort. Bread reduced to crumbs, the pork picked near clean, the fire still strong in the hearth. Cora sat curled against Rio’s side now, her chatter slowing into drowsy murmurs.</p><p>Rio shifted carefully, letting the girl’s head rest against her shoulder. One large hand stayed steady on Cora’s back, holding her as if she were fragile. Her golden brown eyes softened, her body gone very still so as not to disturb her.</p><p>Althea watched the sight in silence for a long while before speaking. “She’s a natural with children,” she said softly, as though she hadn’t meant to voice it aloud.</p><p>Agatha almost sputtered into her wine. She forced out a dry laugh instead, sharp as she could make it. “Yes, well. Let’s start her with puppies before we hand her a nursery, shall we?”</p><p>Althea only smiled faintly, her gaze lingering on Rio as though she saw something in her Agatha wasn’t ready to name.</p><p>On the other side of the table, Lilia had gone very still. Her eyes weren’t on them at all but fixed on the fire, unfocused, distant. Her fingers tightened on the stem of her cup until her knuckles blanched.</p><p>Agatha noticed at once.</p><p>“Lilia?” she asked, her voice cutting through the quiet.</p><p>The older witch blinked, as though startled back into the room. For a heartbeat her face was unguarded — startled, even shaken — but then it smoothed into composure. She set her cup down, forcing a smile. “Nothing. Just too much wine.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t believe her. Her blue eyes narrowed, suspicion already curling through her chest.</p><p>Lilia, sensing it, looked away — toward her granddaughter, now half-asleep against Rio’s shoulder. Her voice gentled. “She hasn’t had enough of this. Family.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She glanced at Rio — sitting there in her cream shirt and stockings, ribbon still crooked in her hair, watching over Cora like she was the only thing that mattered — and back at Lilia, whose mask hadn’t quite settled back into place.</p><p>Something was being kept from her. And Agatha Harkness hated being kept in the dark.</p><p>⸻</p><p>Cora had drifted fully to sleep against Rio’s shoulder by the time the fire burned low. Her curls were mussed, her mouth parted, one small fist still clutching at the edge of Rio’s shirt as though she wouldn’t let go even in dreams.</p><p>Althea rose quietly and moved to lift her daughter. Rio hesitated, then leaned forward carefully, cradling Cora with surprising gentleness before passing her into her mother’s arms.</p><p>Althea pressed a kiss to her daughter’s temple. “Say goodnight,” she murmured. But Cora only stirred faintly, mumbling Rio’s name before settling back down.</p><p>Rio’s golden eyes lingered on her as Althea carried her down the hall, soft and protective in a way that caught Agatha off guard.</p><p>Lilia stood, smoothing her skirts. “Thank you,” she said, her voice steadier now. “For coming. For… this.” She gestured vaguely toward the table, toward the warmth that had lingered between them all evening. “I’d forgotten what it felt like.”</p><p>Agatha inclined her head, careful to keep her tone balanced between civility and distance. “Your hospitality was appreciated.”</p><p>Rio shifted at her side, then added — halting, careful — “Good… night.” The word was slow but clear, and something about the effort made Lilia smile faintly despite herself.</p><p>At the door, Althea reappeared, tired but composed, her daughter settled safely in bed. “It meant a great deal that you came,” she said, her eyes flicking between Rio and Agatha. “Whatever else the council says… you’ll always have a place here.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched in a smile — small, but genuine. “We’ll hold you to that.”</p><p>The night air was cool when they stepped outside, the hush of Salem’s streets pressing close. Behind them, the door shut softly, the glow of Lilia’s hearth dimming.</p><p>Agatha adjusted her cloak, glancing sideways at Rio. “Well,” she muttered, her tone dry but her eyes betraying warmth, “you’ve made yourself a child’s favourite and a grandmother’s delight all in one night. Try not to let it swell your head.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curved in a crooked smile. She slipped her hand into Agatha’s, fingers tentative but firm. “Home?” she asked softly.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand, her chest tightening with something unspoken. “Home,” she echoed.</p><p>And together they walked back through Salem’s shadowed streets, the warmth of family lingering even as the council’s shadow loomed ever nearer.</p><p>⸻</p><p> </p><p>The door had barely closed when Rio pressed Agatha back against it, her hands clumsy but insistent on her waist. Her golden eyes glowed faintly in the dark, hungry and unguarded, the word she’d been clutching all evening falling from her lips in a low whisper.</p><p>“Later?”</p><p>Agatha laughed, startled, her cloak half slipping from her shoulders. “You impossible creature. You’ve remembered.”</p><p>Rio’s answer wasn’t words but a nuzzle into her neck, lips brushing warm against her skin, teeth grazing just enough to make Agatha’s breath catch. Her hands pawed at her hips, unpolished, desperate, and Agatha broke into a helpless giggle.</p><p>“Saints—stop pawing at me like a hound,” she scolded between laughter, pushing lightly at her shoulders. But her hands betrayed her, sliding up into Rio’s hair, pulling her closer.</p><p>Rio only hummed, pleased, her mouth clumsy but hot on her throat. “Mine,” she whispered against her skin.</p><p>Agatha tipped her head back, laughter softening into a sigh. “Hopeless,” she murmured, her voice breaking as she caught Rio’s face between her palms. Her blue eyes gleamed, tender despite her teasing. “Hopeless, and mine.”</p><p>She kissed her then, properly — slow, deep, guiding. Rio melted into it, growling softly as her hands fumbled with the fastenings of Agatha’s gown. Buttons slipped loose under eager fingers, her lack of finesse offset by the reverence in every touch.</p><p>Agatha let the gown fall in a spill of violet fabric, stepping out of it with a grace Rio could only stare at. She arched a brow, lips curving wickedly. “Well? Are you just going to gape at me, or—”</p><p>Rio silenced her with another kiss, harder this time, urgent. Agatha gasped against her mouth, laughing again as they stumbled toward the bed, nearly tripping on her discarded shoes.</p><p>When they tumbled down together, the urgency eased. Rio’s hands slowed, tentative now, as though afraid of breaking her. She traced Agatha’s collarbone, her ribs, her hip, golden eyes wide with awe.</p><p>Agatha cupped her cheek, brushing a thumb along her jaw. “Sweet fool,” she whispered. “You don’t have to worship me.”</p><p>Rio’s voice came halting, low, certain. “Want to.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. She pulled her down into another kiss, softer this time, guiding her with patience, showing her how to move slowly, how to linger. Their bodies found each other in a rhythm that shifted between play and devotion — teeth grazing, laughter sparking, then sighs breaking into tenderness as they moved together.</p><p>Rio whispered broken words as she learned: “Good.” “Warm.” “You.” Each one pressed like a vow into Agatha’s skin.</p><p>And Agatha, sharp and untouchable as she always tried to be, let herself unravel — giggling when Rio’s eagerness outpaced her grace, moaning when reverence melted into heat, whispering her name like a spell when the tenderness tipped into something deeper.</p><p>Rio’s lips met Agatha’s neck, a low growl reverberating against her skin as her fingers fumbled with the  lace of her undergarments. “Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha gasped, her own hands slipping beneath Rio’s shirt, nails raking down her back. “Less talking,” she growled playfully, “more touching.” She arched into Rio’s touch as deft fingers found her breasts, teasing the peaked nipples through the delicate fabric.</p><p>Rio’s answering growl was all animal, a vibration that Agatha felt through her entire body. She pushed Agatha back onto the bed, kneeling between her legs, her golden eyes dark with desire. “Want you,” she rasped, tugging at her undergarments, impatient.</p><p>Agatha lifted her hips, helping Rio slide the last barriers away, a flush rising from her chest to her cheeks. “Then take me,” she challenged, spreading her legs wider, baring herself completely.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed, a snarl breaking past her lips as she descended. Her mouth found Agatha’s centre, hot and demanding, her tongue delving deep with a single-minded focus that made Agatha cry ouy.</p><p>“Gods—” Agatha arched, her hands tangling in Rio’s hair as her tongue worked her with a primal intensity. Each lick, each suck, was a claim, a possession. Rio feasted on her like a starving woman, her growls and snarls vibrating against Agatha’s clit, driving her higher.</p><p>Agatha’s thighs trembled around Rio’s head, her back bowing off the bed as pleasure coiled tight in her core. “Rio—oh—” She was babbling, words lost in the storm of sensation. Rio’s fingers joined her mouth, two digits pushing deep into her, curling against that spot that made stars explode behind Agatha’s eyelids.</p><p>The orgasm hit her like a tidal wave, sweeping her away on a crest of pleasure. She keened, her body convulsing, Rio’s name a chant on her lips.</p><p>Before she could fully come down, Rio was moving, her hands rough as she flipped Agatha onto her stomach. Strong fingers gripped her hips, pulling her up onto her knees. Agatha barely had time to catch herself before Rio was behind her, the hot length of her cock pressing against her entrance.</p><p>“Mine,” Rio growled again, this time a statement, a warning. She pushed in with one smooth thrust, bottoming out in Agatha’s wet heat.</p><p>Agatha groaned, her fingers clutching the sheets. “Yours,” she agreed, pushing back against Rio. “Now move, damn you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t need to be told twice. She set a brutal pace, each thrust slamming against Agatha’s cervix, driving her forward. Her hands held Agatha’s hips in a bruising grip, pulling her back to meet each pounding thrust.</p><p>Agatha’s moans turned into sobs, her body thrumming with sensation. “Harder,” she demanded, meeting Rio thrust for thrust.</p><p>Rio snarled, obliging. She reached around, her fingers finding Agatha’s clit, strumming it in time with her thrusts. The dual stimulation had Agatha seeing white, her second orgasm building rapidly.</p><p>“Rio—” Her voice broke, pleasure cresting. “I’m—”</p><p>Rio’s teeth sank into the flesh between Agatha’s shoulder and neck, not breaking skin but applying enough pressure to send Agatha hurtling over the edge. She screamed, her walls clenching around Rio’s cock, milking her.</p><p>Rio’s growl turned into a howl as she followed Agatha over, her cock pulsing deep inside her, filling her with wet heat. She collapsed forward, her chest pressing against Agatha’s back, her breathing ragged.</p><p>Agatha melted into the mattress, Rio’s weight a comforting anchor. “That,” she panted, “was worth the wait.”</p><p>Rio curled against her, nose buried in her hair, murmuring the word she seemed to love most. “Home.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, pressing her lips to Rio’s temple, and whispered back, “Home.”</p><p>And for that night at least, prophecy and council and ruin all faded away, leaving only a witch and her wolf, finding each other in the dark.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The council chamber was cold even in the late summer, its stone walls holding the chill of centuries. Torches guttered in iron brackets, their flames thin and pale against the long table where the High Council of Salem sat in judgment.</p><p>No voices rose in argument. No accusations flew. Only the sound of iron hinges creaking as a black chest was carried forward, its weight heavy with dust and memory.</p><p>Mora lifted her hand. The chest was set upon the stone and unsealed. A scribe drew forth a roll of parchment, brittle with age, the ink faded but sharp enough still to wound.</p><p>The councillors leaned forward as it was unfurled. The words stared up at them in Lilia’s steady hand.</p><p>Mora read aloud, her voice measured, heavy as frost:</p><p>
<em>“When shadow and moon entwine as one,</em>
<br/>
<em>when witch and beast are woven together,</em>
<br/>
<em>a creation shall rise — neither flesh nor spell,</em>
<br/>
<em>but something born between.</em>
<br/>
<em>It shall walk in silence and thunder,</em>
<br/>
<em>and the walls of Salem shall not endure its coming.”</em>
</p><p>The chamber shivered with the sound of it. Even the torches seemed to bend low, flames shrinking toward the stone.</p><p>One councillor broke first, his voice brittle. “We called her a liar. Banished her for false prophecy. And yet… the wolf walks our streets. Agatha stands beside her. And Lilia—alive, returned—parades with them both.”</p><p>Another sneered, though unease flickered in her eyes. “Do you not see the pattern? Agatha is weaving the prophecy herself. She means to fashion this creation that will undo us. She has always been a rebel. She defied us time and time again, and the people still sing her name. Now she carries wolf and prophet alike under her cloak.”</p><p>Speculation rippled across the table like fire leaping from wick to wick.</p><p>“Perhaps Lilia is the creation.”<br/>“No—it says something born between. Something yet to come.”<br/>“Then Agatha plots even now to bring it forth.”</p><p>Mora let their fear swell before she rose, silver cloak whispering against the floor. She struck her staff once, sharp and commanding. Crack. The chamber silenced.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness has always despised our rule,” Mora said coldly. “She bends no knee. She twists law until it breaks. Alone, she was dangerous enough. Now she flaunts wolf and prophet both, daring us to act. Do you not see? Each day they endure, prophecy takes root. Each whisper makes it stronger.”</p><p>Her eyes swept the table, pale as carved ice. “No blade will stop her. No curse. No decree. She has defied us all. There is but one shadow that has ever bent her to obedience. One hand she has never defied without breaking.”</p><p>The flames guttered lower still.</p><p>Mora’s lips curved, a cruel edge to her smile. “Her mother.”</p><p>The chamber recoiled. Several councillors hissed, others paled as though the name itself was poison.</p><p>“Evanora Harkness abandoned Salem—”<br/>“She betrayed her seat—”<br/>“She would never return—”</p><p>“She will.” Mora’s voice cut through their protests like a knife. “Evanora’s loyalty was never to Salem, nor to kin. It is to power. And what greater power than to return as Salem’s saviour? To stand against her daughter, and prove before all that Agatha’s own blood rejects her.”</p><p>Her hand tightened on her staff. “Bring Evanora back, and we need do nothing else. Agatha will break herself.”</p><p>The chamber sat steeped in silence, heavy with dread. They knew the danger. They knew Evanora was as perilous as prophecy.</p><p>But when Mora struck her staff again, the sound was final, a sentence pronounced.</p><p>“Send the summons. Evanora Harkness returns to Salem.”</p><p><br/>⸻</p><p><br/>Wanda had not meant to linger in the archives that evening. But the words of the council still rang sharp in her ears — Mora’s clipped disdain when Agatha’s name was raised, the murmured fears about Rio’s “nature,” the way silence fell whenever prophecy was mentioned. It was too much. Too pointed.</p><p>Wanda had sat among them, silent, her face composed as always. But within her chest, a low unease had stirred. She had seen councils turn suspicious before, and she knew the scent of it: the air grew brittle, the questions s too rehearsed, the condemnations too eager. Agatha was wilful, yes, but hardly reckless. Rio was wild-born, yes, but not a danger. And yet the council treated them as though their very existence were an offence.</p><p>She had lived long enough to know that when the council sharpened their gaze on someone, it was rarely for the reasons they claimed.</p><p>So Wanda descended into the vaults. Not with accusation, not with certainty — only suspicion, curling cold and steady in her chest, the kind that demanded she <em>look</em> rather than let the matter rest.</p><p>The shelves greeted her like old friends. Their familiar scents — vellum, leather, a faint trace of sage — settled around her shoulders. Here, she had always felt steadied, grounded. Here, knowledge kept its shape. Or so she had believed.</p><p>She walked among the rows with her lantern, eyes sweeping the spines. At first, all seemed well. But then — a gap. A missing volume in the Trials section, its absence disguised but not invisible to someone who knew these shelves as she did.</p><p>Her brow furrowed. She remembered what should have been there — <em>Testimonies of the Trials, Volume VI</em>. She could recall passages word for word, accounts of mortals who had once aided witches. The memory was sharp, as if the words had been etched into her bones. And yet now the space lay bare, the dust unsettled. No record of it being copied, borrowed, or repaired.</p><p>Wanda felt the faintest prickling at the back of her neck. Perhaps she was mistaken. Perhaps memory was playing tricks on her. And yet… her memory was her gift. Keeper of the archives, she carried these words inside her. If she doubted them, what did she have left?</p><p>She moved on, unease growing like a bruise.</p><p>The <em>Histories of the Trials, Volume III</em> felt wrong beneath her hand. She opened it and found the ink strangely uniform, the parchment too fresh. As she read, her lips pressed tight. Passages she had known since her girlhood were altered: lines that had once spoken of mortal allies now spoke only of betrayal. Fear sharpened, nuance erased.</p><p>Her lantern trembled slightly in her grip. She had taught these passages to apprentices, had told them again and again that hunters were unrelenting, merciless, ever-watching. But she remembered another lesson, quieter, buried now — one that admitted there were mortals who had helped them, who had risked themselves for witches. She remembered because that story had given her hope when she was young, proof that the world was not all enemy and fire.</p><p>Now it was gone.</p><p>It was not proof. Not yet. But it was… a shift. A rewriting.</p><p>She turned down the narrow passage toward prophecy, where the air was always cooler, the shelves thinner with dust. Here were the fragile scraps, the half-formed visions that had been gathered across centuries. Wanda’s lantern wavered as she reached for a familiar row — the place where Lilia’s prophecies had once been kept.</p><p>Empty.</p><p>Every last scroll and script. The spaces marked, catalogued under her own hand, but the parchments themselves gone. Even the fragments she remembered binding with ribbon, notes of shadow and moon, had vanished.</p><p>Wanda’s pulse quickened. This was no accident of preservation, no simple misplacement. To strip away a prophet’s words entirely was rare. Dangerous. And yet here, in the archives she tended faithfully, Lilia’s voice had been silenced a second time.</p><p>Her mouth pressed into a thin line. She had nothing to prove it but memory — but memory was enough.</p><p>Deeper in the vault, she found the old festival ledgers. Thin slips of parchment cataloguing rites long out of use. She brushed the edge of one, noting the red ink of censure: <em>Forbidden. To be struck from record</em>. The note was council-standard, neat and familiar.</p><p>And yet… she was certain she recalled an older festival hymn dedicated to the moon that no longer appeared anywhere in these ledgers. Entirely gone, as if it had never existed. She could still hear it in memory: a melody sung low by her grandmother’s voice, words calling down healing in the moon’s light. <br/>If not for that memory, she would doubt it had ever been real.</p><p>Her lantern guttered, shadows stretching long across the stone.</p><p>Wanda closed the ledger carefully, her expression unreadable. She had nothing solid she could bring to the council. To accuse them without proof would be foolish — dangerous, even. But the unease remained, heavier now. Their zeal against Agatha and Rio was not fear of rebellion, nor fear of exposure to mortals, as they claimed.</p><p>It was something older. Something they were hiding.</p><p>And here, in her own archives — the place where she had built her faith in words — Wanda had begun to glimpse its shape. Not in words, but in their careful absence.</p><p>For the first time in years, she felt the weight of doubt settle cold in her chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She found Lilia in the small garden behind the house, kneeling in the soil as if exile had never left her bones. Her fingers brushed the stems of herbs and bitter flowers, coaxing life where stone and shadow had choked it.</p><p>“Busy work,” Lilia murmured without looking up, though Wanda had made no sound. “That is what they give witches they cannot silence. Let them plant roots instead of words.”</p><p>Wanda folded her arms, stepping closer. “You knew they’d bury your prophecy. But they didn’t just hide it. They’ve taken it. Along with another.”</p><p>That made Lilia still. Slowly, she rose, earth clinging to her palms. Her eyes, dark and steady, searched Wanda’s face. “What did you see?”</p><p>“Empty shelves. A missing script. A fragment left behind.” Wanda pulled it from her sleeve, holding it out. “Your hand. Your words. About shadow and moon. Witch and beast. They’re trying to erase it now, even after you’ve returned.”</p><p>A grim smile ghosted Lilia’s mouth. “Of course they are. They thought exile would kill me. Now that it hasn’t, they’ll kill the words instead.”</p><p>“But why?” Wanda pressed. “They’re afraid—yes—but I think it’s more than fear. They think Agatha is trying to use it. You. Rio. They think you mean to destroy Salem from the inside.”</p><p>Lilia’s gaze turned toward the horizon, where night pressed heavy over the rooftops. “Destroy? No. That was never the shape of it. The prophecy does not speak of ending the world. Only ending their world.”</p><p>Her voice lowered, soft but unyielding. “Shadow and moon. Witch and beast. Woven as one. That bond is power, yes. But it is not a weapon unless they make it one. It could be salvation as easily as ruin.”</p><p>“Then what of this… creation?” Wanda asked, more sharply than she intended. “What is it? You saw it—what is it meant to be?”</p><p>For the first time, uncertainty flickered across Lilia’s face. She folded her soiled hands together, as though steadying herself. “I saw something take shape. Not quite born, not conjured either. A presence that did not fit into the patterns I knew. Something… new.”</p><p>She hesitated, eyes lowering. “It carried strength from both sides, witch and beast alike. That much I could feel. Whether it was meant to walk as child, spell, or soul—I could not say. Only that it was bound to them, and through them, to Salem itself.”</p><p>Her eyes lifted again, dark and unwavering. “The council fears it because they cannot control it. Just as they have never controlled Agatha. That is what this truly is—not prophecy, but power slipping from their grasp.”</p><p>Wanda’s stomach tightened. “Then Mora means to tighten her hold… by summoning Evanora.”</p><p>At Lilia’s silence, Wanda pushed on, her voice low and grim. “It is the only path she knows. She cannot control Agatha. She cannot control Rio. And she cannot destroy a bond she doesn’t understand. So she’ll reach for the one witch who terrified them all—the one weapon strong enough, cruel enough, to break what they cannot bend. Mora will call back Evanora, because she believes only Evanora can unmake what you foresaw.”</p><p>Lilia’s mouth hardened. “So they choose the cruelest path. To fight fire with the mother who taught Agatha to fear flames. It will not end in their favour.”</p><p>Silence fell between them, the garden heavy with the scent of turned earth. Wanda’s lantern flickered, casting long shadows across Lilia’s face.</p><p>And Wanda realised, with a shiver, that the prophecy was no longer buried in ink and dust. It was here, alive, unfolding in the flesh before her.</p><p>—————</p><p>The afternoon light slanted through the windows, bright and gold, spilling across the washtub Agatha had dragged into the kitchen. She rarely touched it—magic made quick work of such chores—but today she insisted.</p><p>“Some things you should know how to do by hand,” she said, sleeves already rolled to her elbows. A smirk tugged at her mouth as she looked at Rio. “In case you ever find yourself without me.”</p><p>Rio’s brows drew together, suspicious of the implication, but she said nothing. She crouched beside the tub, watching as Agatha plunged a bundle of linens into the frothy water.</p><p>“See? Rub here, along the board.” Agatha demonstrated, soap bubbles clinging to her fingers. She wrung the fabric with brisk, practiced motions. “Firm, but not savage. You’re coaxing the dirt out, not throttling it.”</p><p>Rio leaned in, imitated the movement—too strong. The linen slapped the water with a sharp <em>splash</em> that sent suds flying straight into Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“Ah!” Agatha gasped, blinking soap from her lashes. Then laughter broke out of her, full and unrestrained. “Rio!”</p><p>Rio froze, then looked at her dripping hand, at the linen half-submerged, and back at Agatha—before plunging both hands in again with a mischievous grin. Another great <em>splash!</em> Suds leapt into the air, soaking her tunic and spattering the floor.</p><p>“Stop!” Agatha tried to scold, but she doubled over with laughter instead, clutching the edge of the tub. Rio, grinning wide now, grabbed another linen and shook it out, managing to douse herself completely in the process. She stood dripping, dark hair plastered to her face, looking half-drowned and entirely pleased with herself.</p><p>Agatha’s laughter grew louder, echoing through the little house until tears pricked her eyes. She sank down onto a stool, pressing a hand to her ribs. But then the room tilted, just slightly, a rush of dizziness cutting her laughter short.</p><p>She caught herself against the edge of the table, breath uneven.</p><p>Rio noticed instantly. Her smile vanished as she crouched down, dripping wet, hand warm and steady on Agatha’s knee. Her dark eyes searched Agatha’s face, sharp with worry.</p><p>Agatha waved her off quickly, forcing a small smile, though her heart was still racing too fast. “I’m fine,” she murmured, brushing damp hair from her face. “Too much laughing, that’s all.”</p><p>Rio’s frown deepened. She lifted one hand, tapped her chest, then pointed to Agatha’s. A silent question: <em>Really?</em></p><p>Agatha covered Rio’s wet hand with her own, squeezing lightly. “Truly. Don’t look at me like that, darling. I promise, I’ll survive a bit of soap and foolishness.”</p><p>For a long moment, Rio’s gaze lingered on her, doubtful but tender. Then, at last, she nodded.</p><p>Agatha straightened, gathering what composure she could, though her knees still felt weak. She reached to pluck a sudsy linen from the tub and dropped it into Rio’s lap with a wicked grin. “Now—since you’re already soaked, you may as well finish the washing.”</p><p>Rio groaned, but Agatha’s laughter started up again, softer this time, curling warm through the kitchen like the smell of soap and sunlight.</p><p>———</p><p>Later, Agatha sat curled in her armchair, a shawl slipping from her shoulders, the book in her lap long forgotten. Across from her, Rio sat on the rug, staring into the flames with the stillness that always made Agatha restless.</p><p>She let hr eyes linger on her. So much power, caged inside a body that often moved with such quiet grace. Agatha had seen glimpses of it—the way Rio’s muscles coiled before a shift, the raw strength that rippled through her when the wolf took hold. It unsettled her, even frightened her, to know such wildness lived within the woman she held at night. But it was awe as much as fear. The wolf was not a monster. It was Rio, distilled to her fiercest truth: teeth bared, fur bristling, a force born to shield what it loved.</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together. She had watched Rio’s body tremble after, had tended to the ache it left behind. And yet she still did not understand what called the wolf forth, what current of instinct ran so deep that it could reshape flesh and bone. The question had gnawed at her for days, curling in her thoughts when she should have been sleeping</p><p>After a time, Agatha tilted her head, studying her. “Tell me something, my love,” she said softly. “Do you know how you do it?”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed, gaze flicking toward her. “Do… it?” she rasped, voice thick with effort.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth curved faintly. “Shift. The wolf. How do you become it?”</p><p>Rio sat back on her heels, shoulders tense. She looked down at her hands, flexing them as though the answer might be etched in her palms. “Hard,” she muttered. “Hard… speak.”</p><p>“Then don’t worry about polish,” Agatha urged, voice coaxing. She leaned forward, her sharpness giving way to patience. “Just try. I’ll listen.”</p><p>Rio drew in a breath, chest rising and falling slowly. She tapped her sternum, then curled her hand like claws, lifting it briefly before pressing it to her chest again. “Wolf… here.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression softened. “In your heart?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, then nodded once. Her hand moved outward, toward Agatha. She struggled with the next word, lips shaping it clumsily. </p><p>“Protect,” she managed. “When… danger.” She shook her head, frustrated, then pressed harder: “When… you.”</p><p>Agatha stilled. Her gaze locked on Rio’s, a sharp ache tugging at her chest. “It comes for me? When you think I’m in danger?”</p><p>Rio swallowed, nodding again. She lifted her hand, pressed it against Agatha’s heart with a kind of fierce clumsiness, then tapped her own chest. “Yours,” she whispered, halting but certain.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, words caught in her throat. For once, no sarcasm or armour rose to meet the moment—only raw, startled emotion. She covered Rio’s hand with her own, holding it firmly against her heartbeat.</p><p>“Oh, my love,” she breathed, voice unsteady. “You don’t even know what you’re saying to me, do you?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened, though she said nothing more. Instead she leaned forward, resting her forehead gently against Agatha’s.</p><p>The fire popped, sparks spiralling briefly upward, but neither of them moved. Agatha let herself close her eyes, feeling the steady weight of Rio’s touch, the wolf that lived in her, the vow that needed no words: when danger came, Rio would stand between her and the dark.</p><p>———</p><p>Far from Salem, where the cliffs broke sharp against a grey and endless sea, an old mansion crouched against the wind. Its windows were black hollows, its stone walls slick with salt and time, and the air around it carried the iron taste of storms. No lantern burned within, but still the place seemed alive, listening.</p><p>Through the gale came the heavy beat of wings. A raven cut through the fog, feathers slick with sea mist. It circled once over the roof before plunging down to a balcony of iron bars, talons clattering against the rail. In its beak it carried a ribbon-bound parchment, wax seal still intact.</p><p>A hand reached out—long, pale, crowned with a dark stone ring. The raven surrendered its burden without struggle.</p><p>Evanora Harkness stood in the doorway, cloak draped heavy over her shoulders, eyes like cold fire catching what little light remained. The bird gave a low croak as she broke the seal, her fingers quick and sure despite their age.</p><p>The parchment crackled as she unfolded it, the ink sharp and precise even in the dimness. Salem’s crest glared from the heading, and the words beneath it bled with urgency: A summons. A command.</p><p>The council called her back.</p><p>Agatha Harkness. Prophecy. Witch and beast. The script spoke of ruin rising within Salem’s walls, of bonds that threatened to unravel order itself. And Evanora—disgraced, exiled, feared—was to return, not in honour, but in necessity.</p><p>Her mouth twisted, the faintest shadow of a smile curving the edges of her lips. She lowered the parchment and held it for the raven to see. “So, Corvin,” she murmured, her voice low as the sea wind. “They send for me. To deal with the shadow they cannot name.”</p><p>The bird tilted its head, feathers ruffling against the storm. Lightning split the sky, the cliffs shuddering beneath the roar. Evanora’s eyes did not leave the page.</p><p>“They cast me out when I ceased to serve them. And now they beg.” Her tone was soft, almost amused. “How quaint.”</p><p>Corvin croaked once, a harsh sound that seemed almost like laughter. Evanora’s gaze drifted past him, to the sea’s endless grey. For the briefest moment, something crossed her face—disdain shadowed with memory. A small girl trailing at her heels, desperate for approval she never gave.</p><p>Her expression hardened. She stroked a finger down Corvin’s beak, a gesture both fond and commanding. “They fear the storm, old friend. But they’ve forgotten who taught it how to break.”</p><p>The mansion groaned in the wind, the tide below crashing harder against the rocks, as if the sea itself recoiled from the words.</p><p>Evanora folded the parchment with precise care and slid it into her sleeve. Then she lifted her cane, its silver handle catching the lightning for an instant, and turned back into the depths of her hollow house.<br/>Corvin launched into the storm behind her, his cry tearing through the gale before the sea swallowed it whole.</p><p>And in Salem, far inland, Agatha Harkness woke with a shiver she could not name. She had stirred from sleep in the deep hours, heart racing, chest tight, the certainty of dread pressing against her ribs as though someone had whispered her name in the dark. </p><p>For a long moment she lay still, listening to the silence, waiting for it to pass. It never quite did.</p><p>———</p><p>The kettle whined on the stove, but Agatha hardly heard it. She was gripping the counter with one hand, waiting for the faint dizziness to pass. It had come on suddenly — the kind of lightheadedness that made the corners of her vision prickle. She exhaled sharply, irritated with herself.</p><p>“Wonderful,” she muttered. “Just what I need. Some wretched summer fever.”</p><p>Her stomach rolled again, uneasy, enough to keep her from pouring the tea. The cup rattled faintly against the saucer as she set it down. She frowned at the tremor in her fingers.</p><p>When she turned, Rio was standing in the doorway, silent as always, dark eyes fixed on her.</p><p>Agatha forced a small, dismissive smile. “Don’t look at me like that. It’s nothing. I’m just… under the weather.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, studying her. She crossed the room slowly, almost cautiously, and brushed her hand along Agatha’s arm. Her touch lingered, warm and steady, before sliding to the small of Agatha’s back.</p><p>The simple contact made Agatha realise how unsteady she still felt. She let herself lean, just a little, though her pride bristled. “It’s nothing,” she repeated, softer now, though the words felt thin.</p><p>Rio leaned close, her nose brushing gently along Agatha’s temple, then down toward her throat. She breathed her in as if listening for something beneath skin and bone.</p><p>Agatha stiffened, caught between annoyance and unease. “What?” she demanded, half a laugh to mask the nerves. “Do I smell like sickness already?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer — not with words. She only stayed there, close enough that Agatha could feel her heartbeat steady against her. A silent presence, patient and searching.</p><p>Agatha’s hand pressed briefly to her temple again, the dizziness still hovering. “It’s just an dizzy spell,” she said, more to herself than to Rio. “It will pass.”</p><p>But Rio’s gaze lingered on her, steady and unsettling, as though she could already sense something neither of them understood.</p><p>Agatha pressed her fingertips to her temple again, irritated with the faint swimming in her vision. “I don’t need a nurse,” she muttered, more to herself than Rio.</p><p>But Rio was already steering her gently away from the counter, one warm hand at the small of her back, the other catching her elbow. Silent, firm.</p><p>“Rio—” Agatha started, but the wolf-girl was unrelenting, guiding her across the room until she found herself nudged down onto the couch. The cushions sank beneath her, soft in a way that felt too indulgent for her current mood.</p><p>Agatha huffed. “You know, this is absurd. I’m hardly an invalid. Just dizzy.”</p><p>Rio only gave her a look — a flat, patient stare that said everything words couldn’t. Then she turned on her heel, padding back to the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha watched, half amused, half incredulous, as Rio approached the kettle still shrieking on the stove. She tugged at the handle with too much force, nearly sloshing boiling water onto the counter. Then she frowned at the teapot as though it had personally offended her.</p><p>“Oh, this I have to see,” Agatha murmured, sinking deeper into the cushions.</p><p>Rio poured — slowly, tongue between her teeth in concentration — and missed the cup on her first try. Hot water splattered onto the saucer, hissing against porcelain. She winced, tried again, managed a little better, then dropped the spoon with a loud clink as she stirred far too aggressively.</p><p>By the time she brought the cup over, brow furrowed with effort, the tea looked like it had survived a minor storm.</p><p>Agatha tried to keep a straight face, but the sound that escaped her was halfway between a snort and a laugh. She clapped a hand over her mouth, shoulders shaking. “Oh—oh gods, Rio. If you could only see your own face.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, frowning in mock offence, though her lips twitched at the corners. She offered the cup with a little flourish, as though presenting a masterpiece.</p><p>Agatha took it, eyes still bright with laughter. “Truly, my love, I don’t know whether to drink this or frame it.”</p><p>Rio settled onto the couch beside her, expression softening. She didn’t need words; the quiet pride in her eyes was enough. Agatha sipped — carefully, for the tea was far too strong — and let the laughter ease something heavy in her chest.</p><p>For a moment, the dizziness didn’t matter.</p><p>For a moment, she let herself be cared for.</p><p> </p><p><br/>The gates of Salem groaned as they opened to the dusk, their iron hinges shrieking like something long buried forced awake. Lanterns along the wall guttered in the damp wind, their pale flames bowing low against the mist that crept up from the marshes. The light did not reach far; shadows swallowed it whole.</p><p>Through the gates stepped a lone figure draped in black. The silver clasp at her throat gleamed faintly, catching the lantern glow for only a moment before the fog claimed it.</p><p>Evanora Harkness.</p><p>She did not hurry. Her cane struck the cobblestones in slow, deliberate rhythm, each tap ringing hollow in the silence of the square. No crowd had gathered. No welcome had been prepared. The people of Salem had drawn their shutters tight, as if hiding would save them from the truth of her return.</p><p>Overhead, a raven glided low, its wings whispering against the night. It circled once, then descended to perch on the crooked iron of the gates. Its eyes glowed faintly in the lantern light, following Evanora with an unnatural stillness.</p><p>The council waited just inside the square, their cloaks drawn close, faces stiff with unease. Though their summons had called her back, none looked pleased to see her. They bowed their heads regardless, bending not from reverence but from fear.</p><p>Evanora passed between them without a word. Her mouth curved in a smile too thin to be kind, her eyes like shards of obsidian as they swept across the city. She looked upon the rooftops, the shuttered windows, the crooked alleys as though nothing had changed since the night she left it all behind. Her raven launched from its perch, wings beating once, twice, before settling on her shoulder with a harsh cry.</p><p>The sound split the silence. Lanterns flickered. The air thickened, charged with the taste of storm before lightning.</p><p>Salem held its breath.<br/>Evanora had returned.</p><p> </p><p><br/>Far across the city, in the quiet of her study, Agatha startled. The candle beside her guttered violently, its flame snapping sideways as if yanked by unseen fingers. No draft stirred. The air was still—too still. Her heart gave a hard, uneven thud that rattled through her ribs.</p><p>She rose too quickly, the shawl sliding from her shoulders in a soft fall of fabric, forgotten on the floor. A chill threaded through her spine as she crossed to the window. The square outside lay in perfect stillness, yet the silence was not peace. It was waiting. Watching. The air pressed against her skin, thick and heavy, like a storm breaking miles away but already clawing at her bones.</p><p>Behind her, Rio stirred. She had been crouched low by the hearth, but now she rose in a smooth, restless motion. Her eyes flicked toward the window, catching the firelight in a dark flash. The muscles across her shoulders drew taut, her jaw rigid. The hair at the nape of her neck bristled as if she had scented a predator in the shadows.</p><p>Agatha reached back blindly, fingers trembling, until they closed around Rio’s hand. She clutched it as if it were the only solid thing in the room. “Do you feel it?” she whispered, her voice thin, stripped of its usual bite.</p><p>Rio nodded once, a sharp, certain motion. No hesitation.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze swept the dark edges of the street beyond the glass. The lamplight seemed dimmer, its glow swallowed by the shadows gathering thick in the corners. A tremor passed through her, quick and cold, stealing her breath. “Something’s changed,” she breathed, her words barely audible, more to herself than to Rio.</p><p>Rio’s hand tightened around hers, anchoring her. The warmth of that grip should have calmed her, but the unease in Agatha’s chest did not ease. It burned hotter, deeper, until it felt like dread itself had taken root beneath her ribs.</p><p>And then—unbidden—memory struck.</p><p>She was a girl again, small and thin, standing in the high shadows of the council chamber. Evanora’s hand gripped her shoulder, nails sharp through the fabric of her dress. “Don’t speak unless I tell you,” Evanora had hissed, her voice soft enough that only Agatha heard. She had nodded, too afraid to meet her gaze. <br/>Later, when she had faltered in a spell, Evanora’s laugh had echoed in her ear, cruel and cutting.<em> Pathetic. You’ll never be anything but a shadow clinging at my heels.</em></p><p>Agatha shuddered, the old sting cutting across her chest as raw as the first time.</p><p>Because she knew. She didn’t need proof, didn’t need sight. Only instinct told her enough.</p><p>Somewhere in Salem, the woman who had abandoned her to shadows, who had left her small and terrified and alone—had come walking back.</p><p><br/>The night did not rest easy on Salem. Shadows lay heavy across the streets, and when dawn came it seemed a pale, thin thing, unable to drive them fully away. The air still tasted of storm.</p><p>Agatha had not slept. She sat rigid in her chair, her shawl wrapped tight now around her shoulders, as though fabric alone might hold her steady. The shiver in her chest had not left; it had only rooted deeper. <br/>Every creak of the house set her teeth on edge.</p><p>Rio kept watch at the window, silent, a dark figure against the pale morning light. Her stillness was deceptive; Agatha could read the tension in her body as clearly as a drawn bowstring.</p><p>The knock came.</p><p>Three sharp raps against the door. Not hurried, not tentative — the sound of someone who had always expected to be obeyed.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. The cup she had been holding rattled against its saucer, porcelain shivering in her grip.</p><p>Rio was already moving, shoulders squared, steps soundless but sure as she went to the door. Her hand hovered at the latch. She turned once, a question in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. Every part of her wanted to say no, to beg Rio to keep the door closed. But her lips formed a different word: “Open.”</p><p>The hinges groaned.</p><p>And there she was.</p><p>Evanora Harkness filled the threshold as though the years had never passed. </p><p>Cloak black as pitch, cane in one hand, and over her shoulders — a great pelt of wolf fur, grey and silver, its head still intact, jaw slack as if mid-snarl. The morning light caught on the strands, and for a heartbeat it looked alive.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach turned to ice.</p><p>Her bravado drained out of her as if it had never existed. She felt herself pulled backward in time, back into the child who had flinched at Evanora’s voice, who had cowered beneath her gaze. Her lips parted, but no sound came. Her chest ached with the familiar pressure of being small.</p><p>Rio’s reaction was instant. Her teeth bared in silence, a sharp intake of breath breaking through her nose like a growl held barely at bay. Her gaze fixed on the pelt —<em> the insult of it</em> — and then on Evanora herself. Every muscle in her body coiled as if she might lunge, tear the cloak from her shoulders, strike the smirk from her face.</p><p>“Enough,” Agatha whispered. Her hand shot out, trembling, to grasp Rio’s wrist. “Please. Don’t.”<br/>Rio turned toward her, disbelieving, anger sparking dark in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, quick and desperate. Her voice was thin, pleading. “Don’t. Not with her.”</p><p>Evanora’s mouth curved, a shadow of amusement — a smile meant to cut. She swept into the room without waiting for welcome, her cane clicking against the floorboards. The wolf pelt trailed behind her like a conquered beast.</p><p>Corvin swooped in after, wings brushing the doorframe before perching high on the mantel. His eyes gleamed in the gloom, unblinking.</p><p>The air inside the house shifted, colder, heavier.</p><p>Evanora’s gaze found Agatha, and for an instant the years collapsed between them. “Still trembling, little one,” she said softly, though the softness was nothing but mockery. “I wondered if time would harden you. But here you are, just as I left you.”</p><p>Agatha stood frozen, Rio’s wrist still caught in her hand, thought it was her own that shook now.</p><p>All the years between them collapsed in an instant. She was no longer Agatha Harkness, scholar and witch of Salem — she was a girl again, small and trembling, standing at her mother’s side, waiting for the sting of words sharper than any spell.</p><p>Her bravado drained, fled her body as if Evanora had snatched it away the moment her shadow crossed the threshold. Agatha could not seem to breathe properly; her throat locked tight, her tongue heavy, her chest burning with the need to speak <em>something</em>  — but nothing came.</p><p>Instead, her mother’s voice did. Low, sharp, precise.<br/> “So. This is what you’ve become. My daughter of Salem, lying with mutts. Dragging the Harkness name into the dirt.”</p><p>Each word landed like a curse, burrowing into the soft places Agatha thought she had long since hardened. She wanted to spit back, to lift her chin, to tell Evanora that Rio was not shame but strength, that love was not weakness. But her lips moved soundlessly, her body rooted to the floor. It was as though Evanora’s presence itself shackled her, forcing her into the same silence she had lived under as a child.<br/>And then Rio growled a word into the air.<br/> “Careful.”</p><p>The sound jolted through Agatha like a crack of thunder. Her heart lurched — not from fear of Rio, never from her, but from the storm that single word would provoke.</p><p>Evanora turned, slow and deliberate, and mocked her with cruel delight. <br/>“Ah. The beast has a tongue. One word. How precious.” She shifted the wolf pelt on her shoulders, as if to remind Rio of what witches had always done to her kind. </p><p>“Shall I teach you another, mongrel? <em>Obey</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered. She felt Rio’s fury beside her, felt it rising hot and dangerous. She should stand with her. She should bare her teeth, lift her voice, shield the woman she loved.</p><p>But she couldn’t move. Couldn’t speak. Her mother’s shadow pressed over her like it always had — heavy, smothering, inexorable. No matter how she tried to force her body to act, it was as if Evanora had cursed her long ago to bend, to cower, to break.</p><p>“Please,” Agatha whispered, “don’t.”</p><p>Her hand clutched at Rio’s wrist, trembling, begging her to hold back. Not because Rio was wrong. Not because she didn’t deserve to be defended. But because Agatha knew — <em>knew</em> — that to defy Evanora was to invite ruin.</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed, confusion shadowing her fury. She had never seen Agatha like this. Never seen her shrink. To her, Agatha was iron, flame, untouchable. But now she trembled beneath her mother’s gaze, voice small, body curling in on itself as though bound by invisible chains.</p><p>Evanora shifted her weight on the cane, her gaze never leaving Agatha. The wolf pelt slid across her shoulders with a sound like dry leaves, the dead beast’s head lolling forward as if mocking the living one in the room.</p><p>“Enough of this charade,” Evanora said smoothly, her voice carrying that terrible certainty that had always made Agatha’s stomach clench. “Send her away.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, her throat going dry. “What?” The word slipped out too quickly, too small.</p><p>“Your mongrel,” Evanora said, with a flick of her chin toward Rio. “Dismiss her. Tell her to leave your side. If you wish to prove you are not the child I remember, if you wish to show me even a shred of strength, then strip yourself of this weakness. Now.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart lurched painfully against her ribs. She turned her head slightly, just enough to see Rio from the corner of her eye. Rio stood firm, shoulders taut, dark eyes locked on Evanora with a fury that burned like fire caught in stone. She didn’t understand — how could she? She had never seen Agatha falter, never seen her bend. And now she stood waiting, protective, confused, unwilling to yield.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, but no sound came. Her breath hitched again and again, her tongue pressed useless against the roof of her mouth. All she wanted was to say <em>no</em>. To say Rio stays. To say I love her and you cannot touch that. But her mother’s voice wrapped around her like it always had — the sharpness, the authority, the curse of obedience carved into her bones long before she knew how to resist it.</p><p>Evanora’s eyes gleamed. “Do it, Agatha.” Her tone dropped lower, quieter, more dangerous. “Dismiss her.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest burned with shame. She squeezed Rio’s wrist tighter, desperate, shaking her head the faintest fraction. Her voice finally broke loose, but it was ragged, pleading, not defiant.</p><p>“Please… don’t make me.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed, confusion flickering into something softer beneath the fury. She turned fully to Agatha now, her free hand brushing her arm, steady, questioning. Her voice, broken and rough, reached for the only word she could shape.</p><p>“Stay.”</p><p>The sound of it nearly undid Agatha. Her throat caught, her eyes stung. She wanted to cling to that word, to that anchor, but Evanora’s gaze bore into her, merciless.</p><p>And in the silence that followed, the room itself seemed to tighten, waiting to see which chain would hold Agatha fast — her mother’s, or her own heart’s.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened, but no words came. Her heart pounded in her chest like a trapped bird. Every part of her screamed to defy, to stand, to say stay. But her lips wouldn’t shape it. Her throat burned.</p><p>Evanora’s voice slid through the silence, calm as a knife pressed to skin. “Say it, Agatha. Send her away.”<br/>Agatha trembled. Her grip on Rio’s wrist faltered, her fingers loosening against their will. Shame scalded her cheeks, shame and terror, and beneath it something colder — something that thrummed like a buried chain, pulled taut with every syllable her mother spoke.</p><p>Her lips moved. She forced breath into sound, though it came out ragged, breaking.</p><p>“Go.”</p><p>Rio stilled.</p><p>The word hung in the air like smoke, bitter and suffocating. For a moment neither of them moved. Agatha’s eyes filled, wide and stricken, pleading even as the command left her mouth. <em>I don’t mean it, don’t listen, please</em>. But the word had already broken between them.</p><p>Rio’s face shifted — first confusion, then disbelief, then the sharp sting of betrayal. She shook her head once, slow, as if she hadn’t heard right, as if the woman who had fought beside her could not possibly be the same one trembling now.</p><p>Her chest rose and fell with a sound that was half-growl, half-breath. The hand she had rested on Agatha’s arm slipped away, leaving Agatha colder for its absence.</p><p>Agatha wanted to snatch it back, to scream the truth, to fall at Rio’s feet if she had to. But her body stayed locked, her voice strangled silent. It was as if invisible threads ran from her tongue to Evanora’s hand, and she could not cut them no matter how she strained.</p><p>“Go,” she whispered again, softer this time, broken. Tears stung at the corners of her eyes, though she tried to hold them back. “Please.”</p><p>That <em>please</em> was not for Evanora. It was for Rio. It was an apology she couldn’t shape fully, a confession buried under years of chains.</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched, fury and anguish warring in her gaze. She didn’t move for a long moment, only stood there, staring, her breath rough in the heavy silence. At last, with a sound more growl than word, she stepped back. Her eyes burned into Agatha’s, dark with hurt. Then she turned and strode from the room, shoulders rigid, the floorboards shaking faintly beneath her steps.</p><p>The door shut with a hollow thud.</p><p>Agatha’s knees buckled. She gripped the table to keep from collapsing entirely, her breath coming fast and shallow.</p><p>Evanora’s smile was thin, satisfied. She tapped her cane once against the floor, a sound that resonated too deep, too sharp. “Good girl,” she murmured.</p><p>And Agatha, shivering, hated herself — hated that some buried part of her had obeyed like she always had, as if her mother’s voice carried more than cruelty. As if it carried a spell, still knotted tight around her bones.</p><p>Evanora stepped further into the room, her cane tapping lightly, leisurely, as though she had all the time in the world. She looked about the house as if it belonged to her — running her eyes along the shelves, the worn chair by the fire, the kettle still cooling on the stove.</p><p>“Pathetic little nest,” she said, lowering herself into Agatha’s chair as though it had been waiting for her all along. The wolf pelt shifted across her shoulders, spilling down over the armrest like a throne’s adornment. Corvin fluttered from the mantel to the back of the chair, claws scraping wood, his eyes gleaming.</p><p>Agatha remained standing, rigid, her knuckles white against the edge of the table. Her chest felt hollow, her throat raw from the word she had forced out — the word that had sent Rio away.</p><p>Evanora rested her cane across her knees, folding her hands atop it. Her gaze pinned Agatha like a needle through cloth.</p><p>“You’ll never be rid of me,” she said softly, almost gently, though the gentleness was a poison all its own. “You thought distance would sever me, that time would dull my reach. But here you are, trembling in your own house, tongue tied at a single command.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, but no sound came. She wanted to scream that it wasn’t true, that she was stronger than this, that she had carved her own path. But the memory of her voice, breaking, whispering <em>go</em> — it chained her as tightly as her mother’s spell.</p><p>Evanora tilted her head, studying her like a specimen under glass. “You think this beast of yours will shield you? You think her arms can hold back what’s in your blood, what’s in mine? No, little shadow. She will never understand you. She cannot save you from me.”</p><p>Agatha flinched, shame burning in her chest, but beneath it something else stirred — a tiny ember of defiance, buried but not extinguished.</p><p>Still, her voice failed her. She stood frozen, silent, watching as her mother claimed her space, claimed her again.</p><p>Evanora leaned back in the chair, the picture of satisfaction. “Now,” she said, smoothing the wolf pelt across her lap, “you will listen. Salem is unraveling, and you, Agatha, are at the root of its ruin. You will do as I tell you, or I will see you brought lower still. And when the council calls me to leash you, you will not resist. You never could.”</p><p>The words sank deep, heavy and final.</p><p>Agatha’s hands trembled where they gripped the table. Behind her ribs, her heart cracked with the memory of Rio’s eyes — hurt, bewildered, betrayed — as she left. She wanted to run after her, to fall at her feet, to explain, to beg forgiveness. But her feet remained planted, her body bound in the old, familiar chains.</p><p>And across the room, Evanora smiled, as though she had already won.</p>

<p>Rio did not remember leaving the house. One moment she was standing in the doorway, Agatha’s voice breaking against her back, that single word <em>go</em> echoing through her chest like a blade. The next, she was moving through Salem’s crooked streets, her breathe hard and ragged, the morning light too sharp in her eyes.</p><p>Her shirt hung loose on her frame, white but worn thin, its collar laced open and shifting with each uneven breath. Her trousers were rough brown cloth, frayed at the hems, her feet bare and stained with earth. She looked ragged and untamed, and yet it was the storm in her eyes that drew every glance.</p><p>By the time she reached Lilia’s garden, her hands were shaking.</p><p>Lilia was bent low among the herbs, Althea sitting nearby with a basket of lavender, and little Cora playing with stones in the dirt. They all looked up when Rio appeared — her shoulders rigid, her eyes burning, her whole body trembling with the storm she couldn’t name.</p><p>“Rio?” Althea’s voice was soft with concern. She rose quickly, brushing soil from her palms. “What is it?”</p><p>Rio tried. She opened her mouth, but nothing came. Her throat strained, her tongue caught, her chest heaved with the effort of speech that would not shape itself. All she could manage was a broken sound, half-growl, half-breath, and a gesture — hands slicing through the air, then clenching into fists.</p><p>Lilia straightened, her dark eyes narrowing, studying the tremor in Rio’s body. “Something’s happened.”<br/>“Yes,” Althea said quickly, moving closer, reaching as though to steady Rio’s arm. “But what? Can you show us?”</p><p>Rio shook her head violently. Her hands went to her chest, pressed flat, then pushed outward as if casting something away. Again and again she repeated the motion, her breath breaking into sharp bursts. Her eyes glistened, wide and desperate.</p><p>Cora stood then, small and solemn. She toddled over, clutching one of her stones, and pressed it gently into Rio’s palm. “Here,” she said in a whisper, as though it were a secret. “For holding.”</p><p>The weight of it was nothing — and yet everything. Rio stared down at the stone, her throat working, tears stinging her lashes. She knelt without meaning to, her knees hitting the soil, and Cora wrapped her tiny arms around her neck. No questions, no demands, only the absolute certainty of a child’s comfort.<br/>Althea’s hand hovered against her mouth, eyes wet. “Oh, gods…”</p><p>Lilia’s gaze did not waver. She was watching Rio shake, watching her crumple around the small body clinging to her, and her mind was already moving. She leaned close to Althea, her voice low, tight. “We need to check on Agatha.”</p><p>Althea nodded. “Yes. Something is wrong.”</p><p>But before they could rise, Lilia stilled. A memory stirred, unbidden — a shadow of another time.<br/>She had been younger, quieter then, standing in the corner of the council chamber while Evanora spoke with another witch. Lilia had not been meant to hear.</p><p><em>“Tell me,” Evanora said, her voice silken but sharp. “Have you ever heard of spells to bend the will? To bind obedience into the marrow of a child?”</em></p><p>The other witch had faltered, stammered, muttered something about theory, danger, forbidden practice. Lilia had looked away, heart pounding, too afraid to draw attention to herself. She had buried the memory deep. Until now.</p><p>Her eyes flicked back to Rio, whose tears still tracked silently down her face as Cora stroked her hair in clumsy little pats.</p><p>And Lilia knew. She didn’t need Agatha’s words to understand.</p><p>Evanora had come back — and she had not come empty-handed.</p><p>Althea touched Lilia’s arm lightly. “We should take her inside.”</p><p>Lilia nodded once. Together they coaxed Rio toward the cottage. She moved stiffly, bare feet dragging on the garden path, her loose shirt damp with sweat, the stone Cora had given her still clenched tight in her hand.</p><p>The cottage was warm, faint with the smell of dried herbs and smoke. Rio collapsed onto the bench by the hearth, her shoulders hunched, head bowed low.</p><p>For a long moment no one moved.</p><p>Then Cora toddled forward, climbing up onto the bench beside her. She pressed her small body against Rio’s side, tucking herself beneath the curve of her arm as though she had always belonged there. One little hand reached up to touch Rio’s damp cheek, wiping at the tear tracks with all the clumsy earnestness of a child.</p><p>“Don’t cry,” she whispered. “You’re safe.”</p><p>Rio’s chest hitched. Her hand trembled, but she curled it carefully around Cora’s back, clutching her as though she were the only anchor left in the world. Her head lowered until her forehead pressed against the child’s hair. A broken sound escaped her — half sob, half growl — muffled in Cora’s crown.</p><p>Althea stood back, hands pressed against her own chest. She couldn’t speak. Watching them, her throat tightened until it hurt. Her heart cracked at the sight of Rio, so raw and undone, held steady by a child’s simple certainty.</p><p>Lilia, meanwhile, had turned to the window, her expression grim. “Wanda,” she murmured under her breath. “We’ll need her. She’ll know what’s been hidden. The Archives will tell what the council tries to bury.”</p><p>Her fingers curled against the sill as she stared into the fog outside. “Yes… Wanda must see this for herself.”</p><p>Althea finally tore her gaze away from Rio, eyes glistening. “You mean to go into the city?”</p><p>“Not mean,” Lilia answered, voice low. “Must. If Evanora’s hand is on Salem again, then the proof lies in ink and dust. I’ll not wait for her shadow to swallow us whole.”</p><p>Rio clung tighter to Cora, the small girl whispering soft nonsense into her shoulder — the kind of comfort only a child could give, certain and unshaken.</p><p>And Althea, though her heart was breaking, said nothing. She only watched, praying silently that it would be enough to hold Rio together until they could act.</p><p>————</p><p>Evanora lounged in Agatha’s chair as though it belonged to her, the wolf pelt spilling down like a banner of conquest. Corvin shifted on the mantel, feathers rustling, his dark eyes unblinking.</p><p>Agatha remained standing, spine rigid though her hands trembled at her sides. Every word her mother had spoken still pressed like bruises against her skin — weak, shame, mongrel — echoing louder than the sound of her own heartbeat.</p><p>Evanora’s eyes narrowed, her gaze sweeping over her daughter with clinical sharpness. “There’s something in you,” she murmured, leaning on her cane. “A shift I can’t quite name. Your aura quivers… not with fear alone.”</p><p>Agatha stiffened. Heat rushed to her face, though she didn’t know why. Fear coiled low in her stomach.<br/>Evanora’s mouth twisted into a humourless smile. </p><p>“It’s nothing you’ll be clever enough to hide from me forever. No matter.” She dismissed the thought with a flick of her hand. “What matters is this — expect to see me often, Agatha. Salem will once again learn the shape of my shadow, and you will relearn your place within it.”</p><p>Her gaze sharpened suddenly, cutting like a blade. “And as for that beast you’ve entangled yourself with — keep away from her. Do you hear me? She drags our name through the muck with every step she takes at your side. You will not shame me further by lying down with mongrels. If I find you near her again, you’ll both regret it.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, a protest trembling on her tongue, but nothing came. She stood mute, frozen, the leash tightening invisible around her throat.</p><p>Evanora rose, the wolf pelt shifting across her shoulders like a cloak of trophies. Her cane struck the floor with a sharp report as she moved to the door. “We will speak again, child.”</p><p>And then she was gone.</p><p>The silence that followed was suffocating. Agatha stood frozen for a heartbeat, her breath shallow, her body trembling. Then the sickness surged up — sudden, violent. She lurched to the basin, bracing herself on its edge as bile tore its way from her throat. Her shawl slipped from her shoulders, pooling forgotten at her feet.</p><p>When the fit passed, she sagged against the basin, tears already spilling down her cheeks. Her body shook with sobs she could no longer contain.</p><p>Rio’s face burned behind her eyes — the confusion, the betrayal, the way she had turned at that single word<em>: Go</em>.</p><p>Agatha pressed her hands to her mouth, choking on her own shame. The echo of that word rattled inside her chest like a curse she’d spoken over herself.</p><p>She slid to her knees on the floorboards, curling into herself, her sobs breaking the silence of the house. For the first time in years, she felt like a child again — small, powerless, trapped in her mother’s grasp.</p><p>And though she could not name it, the sickness in her belly lingered, a strange, restless ache that was more than grief.</p><p>Agatha stayed crouched on the floor until her sobs wrung her dry. The house was silent around her, every corner still carrying her mother’s shadow. Her breath came ragged, each one catching on the jagged edges of shame.</p><p>At last, she dragged herself upright, clutching the edge of the table for balance. Her eyes swept the room — empty, too empty. The hearth was cold, the bench bare. She felt the hollow space where Rio should have been, as keen as if someone had carved it out of her chest.</p><p>Her lips parted, instinct rising before she could stop it. “Rio—”</p><p>The name caught in her throat. She swallowed it down, choking on the bitter truth: Rio was gone. She had sent her away.</p><p>Her hand gripped the table so hard her knuckles ached. “Please,” she whispered into the silence, though no one could hear her. “Please come back.”</p><p>The air didn’t stir. No answering step creaked on the floorboards. Only the echo of her mother’s cane still rang faintly in her ears, a rhythm that bound her as surely as any spell.</p><p>Agatha sank back into her chair, pressing both hands against her face. She could almost see Rio’s eyes again — dark, bewildered, brimming with hurt. The memory sliced deeper than her mother’s barbs ever had.</p><p>“I didn’t mean it,” she murmured, the words muffled against her palms. “I didn’t mean it, my love.”</p><p>But the house gave her no answer. The silence was unbroken, heavy as stone.</p><p>And for the first time, Agatha wondered if Rio would come back to her at all.</p><p> </p><p>The streets of Salem were damp with nightfall when Lilia slipped into them, her hood pulled low against her brow. The robe cloaked her shape, hiding her face from the lantern glow and, more importantly, from the eyes of the council’s watchers who lingered in corners and alleys, feigning disinterest.</p><p>She moved swiftly but without haste — too quick and they would follow, too slow and they would notice. The damp cobblestones gleamed faintly beneath her steps until at last the looming façade of the Archives rose before her, dark stone against darker sky.</p><p>Inside, the air was cool and dry, the scent of vellum and ink layered over centuries. Only a single lantern burned in the deepest chamber, where Wanda Maximoff bent over a table stacked with scrolls, her fingers brushing careful lines of text.</p><p>“Wanda,” Lilia’s voice cut softly through the hush, carrying more weight than volume.</p><p>The archivist looked up sharply, surprise flickering across her composed features. When she saw the hood fall back from Lilia’s face, she set her quill aside. “Lilia. You shouldn’t be here at this hour.”</p><p>“I know,” Lilia said, stepping closer, lowering her voice. “But I had no choice.”</p><p>Wanda studied her a moment longer, then gestured for her to sit. “Tell me.”</p><p>Lilia did not sit. Her hands were clasped tight in front of her, her eyes shadowed. “Evanora has returned. You’ve felt it already, I’m sure — the council cloaking their fear with ceremony. But there is more. She is not only dangerous because of her power. She may hold something worse.”</p><p>Wanda’s brows furrowed. “Worse?”</p><p>Lilia exhaled slowly, as if steadying herself. “I think… I think she has some hold over Agatha. Something old. Something woven deep. Tonight, I saw Rio come apart like a wounded thing, and she could not explain it. But I know what it means. Evanora has a way of turning Agatha against even those she loves.”</p><p>For a moment, Wanda said nothing, only folded her hands against the table. Her eyes, sharp and weary, searched Lilia’s face.</p><p>“You believe this is more than fear,” she said at last.</p><p>“Yes.” Lilia’s voice dropped, taut with urgency. “I saw the cracks tonight — in Rio, in Agatha’s silence. Evanora is not simply cruel. She is cunning. If she has laid a spell upon her daughter — a leash buried in her bones — then every step Agatha takes from now may not be her own. And if that is true, then Evanora is not merely dangerous.”</p><p>She met Wanda’s gaze fully, her own dark and unyielding.</p><p>“She is catastrophic.”</p><p>The lantern sputtered, its light throwing long shadows across the stone shelves. Wanda leaned back slowly, her expression unreadable.</p><p>“If what you say is true,” she murmured, “then Agatha is already in more danger than she knows. And Rio…” She paused, the faintest flicker of grief ghosting her face. “Rio may break before she understands why.”</p><p>Lilia nodded grimly. “That is why I came to you. You are the keeper of what the council hides. If there is any proof of such a spell, it will be here. We need to know the truth before Evanora buries it deeper.”</p><p>Wanda’s gaze lingered on her for a long, heavy moment. Then she reached for a stack of keys at her side.<br/>“Then let us begin.”</p><p>The iron keys clinked softly in Wanda’s hand as she led Lilia deeper into the Archives. The lantern’s glow caught dust motes in the air, shadows stretching tall against the stone as they passed.</p><p>They stopped before a narrow door at the back, half-hidden by shelves. Wanda unlocked it with slow, deliberate movements. “This section is sealed,” she murmured. “Not by dust or time, but by decree. The council forbids even me to linger here too long.”</p><p>Inside, the air was heavier, older, as though every word inked onto the shelves still carried the weight of its crime.</p><p>Wanda set the lantern down on a table scarred by centuries of hands. Her fingers moved with habitual care across the spines, pausing now and then, searching. Finally she drew out a thin, leather-bound folio, its edges darkened as if scorched.</p><p>She opened it slowly. The first page bore the council’s mark in crimson ink: <strong>Prohibited. Mind-binding. Outlawed.</strong></p><p>Lilia leaned closer, her breath catching.</p><p>“Mind-binding,” Wanda said softly, her voice low with distaste. “The oldest and most forbidden branch of Salem law. Even darker than blood rites. It was outlawed after the first Trials, deemed too dangerous to exist. To strip the will from another witch is to strip her soul. It was considered a crime against magic itself.”</p><p>Her eyes moved across the page, narrowing. “Most believed the knowledge burned. But here—” She tapped a passage written in faded script. “Fragments remain. Notes of experimentation. And here… mention of Evanora Harkness.”</p><p>Lilia’s stomach turned. “So it’s true. She asked.”</p><p>“More than asked,” Wanda said grimly. “She studied it. She sought to refine it.”</p><p>For a moment, silence hung heavy between them. Then Wanda’s expression darkened further, shadows deepening across her face.</p><p>“You know,” she said quietly, “before Evanora left Salem of her own accord, there were whispers. Accusations that she had obtained the only surviving copy of <em>The Darkhold.</em>”</p><p>Lilia’s breath hitched. “The Darkhold is a myth. A tale to frighten apprentices.”</p><p>“So the council said,” Wanda replied. “So they told us all. But the truth?” She placed her palm flat against the folio, her fingers splayed as though steadying herself. </p><p>“The Darkhold is real. And it is the most dangerous grimoire ever inked — pages written in shadow, filled with spells that corrupt the hand that casts them. If Evanora acquired it, then her knowledge runs deeper — and darker — than anyone here dares admit.”</p><p>Lilia’s face hardened. “Then Agatha—”</p><p>Wanda snapped the book shut before she could finish, her eyes hard. “If Evanora has laid such a spell on her daughter, then Agatha is not merely trapped by fear. She is bound by lawless magic — forbidden, buried, and unspeakably dangerous. Darkhold magic would make it unbreakable.”</p><p>The lantern guttered, throwing their faces into shadow. Wanda exhaled, her voice grave.</p><p>“This is no longer a matter of family wounds or prophecy, Lilia. If Evanora has resurrected mind-binding — and she has the Darkhold — then she carries into Salem a crime older than the council itself. And Agatha… is the vessel of it.”</p><p>Lilia’s hands curled into fists, her voice low and fierce. “Then we must find a way to break it — before Salem is swallowed whole.”</p><p>————</p><p>The council tower loomed above Salem, its stone walls slick with the mist that rolled in from the marshes. At its highest chamber, where once only council decrees had been drafted, now stood Evanora Harkness.</p><p>She had claimed the room without asking. Heavy curtains hung open, and from the tall arched window she gazed out over the city. Salem’s lanterns glowed dim in the fog, little sparks scattered in the dark. She regarded them as a queen might regard her subjects — distant, dismissive, already hers.</p><p>Behind her, on the council table polished by centuries of hands, the Darkhold hovered open. Its pages pulsed faintly, the ink alive with its own restless energy. Shadows coiled and uncoiled across the parchment, the glow they cast unnatural, seeping into the cracks of the chamber like a creeping blight.</p><p>Corvin perched on the high-backed chair beside it, feathers glossy black in the Darkhold’s light. His eyes followed Evanora, head tilting with each measured step she took across the stone floor.</p><p>“They’ve welcomed me back, old friend,” Evanora murmured, her voice low, amused. “Oh, they did not say the word, but their silence, their bowed heads, their fear — that was welcome enough. They think me their weapon against Agatha, against this prophecy.”</p><p>The raven croaked, sharp and knowing.</p><p>Evanora’s eyes slid to the Darkhold, her lips curving. “But we know better, don’t we? Agatha was only the beginning. My test. My proof.” She touched a page without flinching, the ink swirling like smoke beneath her fingertip. “And still, after all these years, she bends. She breaks. She obeys.”</p><p>Her smile sharpened, a glint of teeth. “The spell endures. Not for days, not for years, but for a lifetime. The leash cannot be loosed.”</p><p>She turned back toward the window, the city sprawled beneath her like prey. “Imagine it, Corvin. Not one girl. Not one family. But Salem entire. Every witch, every council member. Bound. Their wills mine to command.”</p><p>The raven ruffled his feathers, letting out a low rasp of agreement.</p><p>Evanora lifted her cane, its silver head gleaming faintly in the Darkhold’s glow. “They summoned me to save them. Instead, I will give them what they always feared — order absolute, obedience unbroken.”</p><p>The Darkhold shivered open to another page, script bleeding darkly across the parchment, as if it had been waiting for her.</p><p>Evanora’s eyes gleamed, cold and certain. “Let the council believe they control me. Soon, Corvin, Salem will remember who truly holds the leash.”</p><p>Thunder rolled low above the tower, and the Darkhold’s glow deepened, spilling like black fire across the chamber walls.</p><p>————</p><p>The cottage was warm, dim with lamplight, when Rio slipped from her seat by the hearth. Althea’s voice floated softly from the back room where she was tucking Cora into bed, the little girl’s sleepy murmur rising now and then in reply.</p><p>Rio’s chest was still tight, her hand clenched around the stone Cora had given her earlier. She couldn’t sit still. Couldn’t breathe with the thought of Agatha’s face — pale, stricken, her voice breaking on that single word: <em>Go</em>.</p><p>Before Althea could return, Rio pushed herself to her feet. She moved with silent purpose, barefoot across the wooden floor, pulling open the door and stepping into the cool night air. The latch clicked shut behind her.</p><p>The streets were hushed, mist clinging to the cobblestones. She didn’t need to think about where she was going. Her feet carried her, steady and certain, through Salem’s crooked lanes until the familiar gate loomed before her. Agatha’s garden lay beyond, wild with herbs and moonflowers that swayed faintly in the night breeze.</p><p>Rio stopped there, her hand braced against the iron. She stared at the house, her chest rising and falling in sharp breaths. She wanted to go to her — to hold her, to demand answers, to forgive and yet not forgive all at once. But her body stayed rooted. The wound was still raw. The echo of that word still burned.</p><p>She stood in the shadow of the gate, silent and uncertain, when the door opened.</p><p>Agatha stepped into the threshold, a shawl clutched tight around her shoulders. Her eyes swept the garden, haunted, until they landed on Rio’s still figure at the gate. Her breath caught audibly, and she gripped the doorframe for support.</p><p>“Rio…” Her voice broke on the name, raw and desperate. She took a step forward, the shawl slipping slightly, her eyes shining wet in the lantern light. </p><p>“Please — please forgive me. I don’t understand why I said it. I don’t know what came over me. I swear to you, I never wanted you gone.”<br/>Her words spilled like a flood, trembling with grief and terror. </p><p>“You are all I have. You are everything. And still I—” She pressed a hand over her mouth, stifling the sob. “I sent you away.”</p><p>The night hung heavy between them. Rio’s grip on the gate tightened until her knuckles whitened. She didn’t move forward, but her eyes — dark, wide, aching — never left Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha stepped down onto the path, her tears falling freely now. “I’m so sorry. Gods, I’m so sorry. Whatever curse is on me, whatever shadow my mother cast — it is not stronger than what I feel for you.” She pressed a trembling hand against her chest.</p><p> “Not stronger than this.”</p><p>Her voice dropped to a whisper. “Please… don’t leave me.”</p><p>The mist stirred faintly in the garden, carrying the scent of crushed herbs. Rio’s chest heaved, torn between the sharp sting of betrayal and the pull of Agatha’s pain.</p><p>She loosened her grip on the gate, but still she did not step forward.</p><p>Agatha’s words still trembled in the air between them, raw and bleeding. She stood in the path with her shawl slipping, tears streaking her face, her hand pressed desperately to her chest as though it could hold her breaking heart together.</p><p>Rio hadn’t moved. Her hand clutched the iron gate so tightly the metal bit into her palm. Her chest rose and fell in ragged breaths, eyes locked on Agatha, full of storm and ache.</p><p>Agatha took another step toward her, voice shaking. “Please… I don’t know why I did it. I don’t know what she made me say. But it wasn’t mine, Rio. It wasn’t my choice.” Her lips trembled. “Don’t let her take you from me.”</p><p>Rio’s throat worked. The stone Cora had given her was still warm in her hand, pressing into her skin as if reminding her she wasn’t alone. Slowly, she lifted it, staring at it for a long moment before closing her fist around it and letting her hand fall.</p><p>Her dark eyes rose again to Agatha’s, glistening.</p><p>And then — with effort that seemed to tear from her very chest — she forced a word past her lips.</p><p>“Stay.”</p><p>The sound was rough, broken, but clear.</p><p>Agatha’s knees nearly buckled. A sob tore from her throat, half relief, half anguish, as she stumbled forward, closing the distance between them. She stopped just short of touching, her breath trembling, afraid to reach without permission.</p><p>Rio’s hand left the gate. She raised it slowly, deliberately, and pressed her palm to Agatha’s cheek. Her thumb brushed across damp skin, clumsy but certain.</p><p>Agatha leaned into the touch at once, her sobs breaking open again. “I will. I swear it. I’ll stay. Whatever she does, whatever she tries — I’ll fight her for you.”</p><p>Rio let out a low, guttural sound — not quite a growl, not quite a sob — and pulled Agatha against her chest. The shawl slipped away, pooling on the path, but Agatha clung to her with shaking hands, burying her face into the rough fabric of Rio’s shirt.</p><p>For a long moment, neither spoke. The garden was silent but for their breaths, uneven and fierce, two hearts hammering in unison.</p><p>And though the shadow of Evanora lingered over the house, for that moment, in the mist and moonlight, they held only each other.</p><p>————</p><p>The high chamber of the council was lit by cold lanterns, their pale flames shivering against stone. The councillors sat stiff in their chairs, cloaks drawn close, eyes wary as Evanora stood before them. Corvin shifted on her shoulder, feathers gleaming black as oil, his gaze as sharp as hers.</p><p>She leaned lightly on her cane, the wolf pelt trailing behind her like a banner of conquest. “You summoned me to contain your little problem,” she said, her tone smooth, measured. “My daughter. Her mongrel. The prophecy.”</p><p>The word <em>mongrel</em> curled with disdain, and several councillors flinched at it. Evanora’s smile sharpened.<br/>“I can convince Agatha to rid herself of the beast,” she continued, her voice low but certain. “She will see reason. Or failing that, she will obey. Either way, Rio will no longer be a thorn in your side.”</p><p>Councillor Mora shifted uncomfortably. “And what do you ask in return?”</p><p>Evanora’s eyes gleamed, obsidian bright. “My place restored. A seat at this table. Access to the Archives without the petty restrictions you place on others. No locked doors. No forbidden shelves. If I am to cleanse Salem, I must be armed with all its knowledge.”</p><p>A ripple of unease moved through the council, but silence stretched too long, and silence was consent. Mora cleared her throat, voice thin. “So be it. Agatha must be contained, and if Rio is the cost—” She faltered. “You shall have what you ask.”</p><p>Evanora inclined her head, lips curving faintly. “Wise.”</p><p>When she swept from the chamber, her cane tapping against the stone, Corvin croaked once — a sound like a laugh.</p><p>She returned to the tower chamber she had claimed as her own. The curtains gaped wide, showing Salem sprawled in fog below. But Evanora’s gaze turned to the council table, where the Darkhold hovered open, its pages seething faintly with shadows that writhed and reformed like smoke.</p><p>She had felt it earlier, faint but certain: a flicker of resistance. Agatha’s will stirring against the leash. </p><p>Her smile thinned. “So, you would strain against me, child?”</p><p>Corvin tilted his head, watching.</p><p>Evanora stroked a fingertip across the page, unflinching as the ink bled darkly beneath her touch. The Darkhold answered her, the shadows writhing higher, eager.</p><p>“Then no more half-measures,” she whispered. “No more threads left loose.”</p><p>Her voice dropped to a command, smooth and cold. “Come to me, child.”</p><p>The words sank into the parchment, and the Darkhold shivered, sending a ripple of shadow out across the chamber. Corvin ruffled his feathers, his black eyes gleaming with satisfaction.</p><p> </p><p>In Agatha’s cottage, the air shifted. The fire guttered low, and Agatha’s breath caught mid-sob as if invisible fingers had closed around her throat. Her body went still, her gaze fixed, her expression emptying into something vacant, glassy.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio’s voice was low, rough with worry. She reached for her, brushing her arm. “Mm?”</p><p>But Agatha did not answer. She rose smoothly, almost too smoothly, her eyes unfocused. Her shawl fell from her shoulders as she walked to the door in silence.</p><p>Rio stood sharply, alarm flashing through her. She moved to block the path, hands outstretched. <br/>“Stay.”</p><p>Agatha did not pause. Her lips parted, and when she spoke, her voice was low, hollow, not entirely her own. “I must go.”</p><p>Rio’s chest heaved. She caught Agatha’s wrist, trying to hold her. “No.”</p><p>For an instant, Agatha’s hand trembled in hers — but then the Darkhold’s whisper surged through her, and her eyes flared with unnatural light. She raised her other hand and with a sharp flick of power, a blast of force struck Rio in the chest.</p><p>The sound cracked like thunder in the small cottage.</p><p>Rio was hurled back into the bench, wood splintering under the impact. She landed hard, the breath ripped from her lungs, her body curling as pain lanced through her ribs.</p><p>Agatha did not look back. She stepped over the threshold and into the night, her shawl forgotten on the floor, her face slack and entranced.</p><p>The door closed hard behind her.</p><p>Rio dragged herself upright, breath ragged, eyes wide and burning. Confusion, fury, and fear tangled in her chest — but one truth burned through the chaos.</p><p>Agatha was gone.</p><p>The slam of the door still echoed when Rio forced air back into her lungs. Her chest ached, her ribs sharp with pain where the blast had struck her, but she shoved herself upright, teeth bared against the hurt.</p><p>“Agatha—” The name tore from her throat, ragged, almost a growl.</p><p>The shawl lay crumpled on the floor, still warm with Agatha’s body heat. Rio snatched it up, clutching it tight for a moment before shoving it over her arm. She stumbled to the door, flung it wide, and staggered into the mist.</p><p>Agatha was already halfway down the garden path, moving like a sleepwalker — slow, steady, relentless. Her hair stirred in the damp night air, her eyes unfocused, glassy with trance.</p><p>Rio’s heart pounded. She half-ran, half-limped down the path, calling her name again, desperate, but Agatha didn’t falter. She didn’t even seem to hear.</p><p>The gate swung shut behind her with a hollow clang.</p><p>Far above Salem, the council tower loomed. In the chamber Evanora had claimed, the Darkhold hovered open on the table, its pages alive with shifting ink. The shadows it cast curled across the stone floor like roots digging deep.</p><p>Evanora stood before it, one hand resting lightly on her cane, the other stretched toward the book as though drawing strength from its pulse. Her lips moved in a whisper, soft and commanding.</p><p>“Come to me, child. Come.”</p><p>The words sank into the parchment, and the Darkhold shivered with delight, its glow deepening, its script bleeding into new shapes. Corvin croaked from his perch, wings flexing, as though savouring the power that rolled through the chamber.</p><p>Agatha’s feet struck the cobblestones in even rhythm, bare to the cold damp, but she did not shiver. She did not see the shuttered windows, the lanterns guttering low, the stray cats darting into shadows. Her body moved without her will, guided by a tether older and darker than memory.</p><p>Behind her, Rio stumbled in pursuit, blood in her mouth from where she’d hit the bench, every muscle screaming. Yet she kept going, her voice hoarse, her words broken but fierce.</p><p>“Stay—Agatha, <em>fight!</em>”</p><p>But the name, the plea, the growl all fell useless into the fog.</p><p>Agatha never slowed.</p><p>The fog wrapped Salem in silence, broken only by the sound of Agatha’s footsteps — steady, trance-like, unyielding. Her shawl still hung over Rio’s arm, the only proof she had of the woman she loved.</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio’s voice was rough, torn from her throat, more growl than word. She stumbled over the uneven cobblestones, pain flaring in her chest with each breath, but she pushed forward, driven by something deeper than breath or bone.</p><p>Agatha did not turn.</p><p>Rio surged closer, desperate, and caught her wrist, yanking hard. For an instant, the contact seemed to break something — Agatha faltered, her eyes flickering, lips parting as though a word might form.</p><p>But then her gaze went glassy again. Her free hand lifted, glowing with crackling force.</p><p>“Agatha, <em>no</em>—”</p><p>The blast struck Rio square in the chest. Pain exploded through her ribs as she was hurled backward into a stack of barrels, the wood splintering and crashing loud into the night. She gasped, vision swimming, unable to pull air into her lungs.</p><p>The noise carried through the street like a bell. Shutters opened, lanterns flared, and voices murmured in confusion.</p><p>Above it all, another voice cut sharp and sure. “Rio, stop!”</p><p>Wanda Maximoff strode from the mist, crimson cloak flaring, her hands already lifted. She knelt quickly by Rio, catching her before she could try to rise again. “Stay down,” she whispered, steady, her eyes flicking over the bruises blooming across Rio’s chest.</p><p>Agatha had stopped only briefly at the commotion, her head turning like a puppet caught on strings. For a heartbeat, Wanda thought she might waver — but then her body pivoted smoothly toward the looming council tower, and she resumed her slow, relentless march.</p><p>“Gods,” Wanda murmured, holding Rio firm as the younger woman struggled against her grip. “She’s not walking of her own will. She’s being pulled.”</p><p>Rio growled low, furious, trying to tear free, but Wanda tightened her hold. “No. If you rush her now, she’ll kill you without ever knowing it. That’s not her hand striking you, Rio — it’s Evanora’s.”</p><p>The words landed heavy, but Rio’s body stilled, trembling with frustration and grief. She clutched the shawl tighter, her knuckles white around the fabric.</p><p>Together, they watched as Agatha drifted further into the fog, her figure growing smaller with each steady step, her path unmistakable.</p><p>Toward the tower.</p><p>Toward Evanora.</p><p>Wanda kept her arm firm around Rio’s waist as they made their way through Salem’s misty streets. Rio’s body was rigid with pain, but her eyes never left the faint outline of the council tower, even as it disappeared into the fog. Wanda felt the tremor in her step, the unspoken rage in her chest, and quickened her pace.</p><p>At last, she guided her into a quiet house tucked away from the main square. The shutters were drawn, the garden outside overgrown, and inside smelled faintly of herbs and ink. Wanda pushed the door shut behind them and eased Rio onto the long couchby the hearth.</p><p>“Sit. Don’t argue.”</p><p>Rio obeyed, though her breath came sharp, her shirt clinging where the blow had struck. Wanda crouched in front of her and pulled the fabric gently up over her ribs. Bruises were already blooming dark and angry across her skin. Wanda’s lips pressed into a thin line.</p><p>“She hit you hard,” she murmured, reaching for a jar of salve. Her voice was steady, but there was a shadow in her eyes.</p><p>Rio growled low, her hand twitching as though to wave Wanda off, but Wanda caught it briefly, squeezing. “Don’t. Let me help.”</p><p>She dipped her fingers into the cool paste and began smoothing it carefully over the bruises. Rio flinched at the first touch, but didn’t pull away. Her dark eyes stayed locked on Wanda, wide and bewildered, searching for answers Wanda knew she couldn’t fully give.</p><p>“She doesn’t mean it,” Wanda said softly, her tone low, deliberate. “Do you understand? Agatha didn’t want to hurt you. That wasn’t her hand. It was Evanora’s.”</p><p>Rio’s chest rose and fell sharply, a growl rumbling deep in her throat, but Wanda shook her head gently. “I know. I know it doesn’t feel that way. But she would never do this to you of her own will.” Her thumb brushed lightly across Rio’s skin as she worked the salve in. “You have to hold to that truth, Rio. Or else Evanora wins twice.”</p><p>For a long moment, the only sound was Rio’s uneven breathing. Wanda leaned back slightly, her mouth twitching with something almost like a smile, though her eyes stayed grave.</p><p>“And besides,” she said, voice softer, “can you imagine how furious Agatha will be when she realises she made you bleed? You’ll never hear the end of it.”</p><p>Rio blinked, startled, and a strangled sound broke from her throat — not quite a laugh, not quite a sob.<br/>Wanda let the moment hang, then added, quieter still, “She loves you, Rio. Enough to break her own chains if she has to. But until we can cut them, you must remember — she is not your enemy.”</p><p>Rio bowed her head, hair falling into her eyes, her fist clenched around the shawl Agatha had left behind. Wanda’s hand lingered steady on her shoulder.</p><p>The lantern flickered, shadows climbing the walls, but in that small circle of light Wanda’s voice was calm, sure.</p><p>“You’re not alone in this.”</p><p>And though her chest still ached, Rio let herself breathe.</p><p>The salve left a faint sheen across Rio’s skin, the bruises dark and angry but already cooling beneath Wanda’s careful touch. Wanda capped the jar and set it aside, sitting back on her heels with a quiet sigh.<br/>Rio hadn’t moved. She sat hunched forward on the bench, clutching Agatha’s shawl so tightly the fabric twisted in her fists. Her jaw was tight, her eyes darker than Wanda had ever seen them, burning with a confusion and grief she had no words for.</p><p>Wanda watched her a long moment, then rose slowly, stretching the stiffness from her knees. She crossed to a chest against the wall and pulled out a folded blanket, shaking it open with a snap.</p><p>“You’re staying here tonight,” she said simply.</p><p>Rio’s head lifted, startled. She let out a rough sound — half question, half protest — and gestured toward the door with her chin.</p><p>“No.” Wanda’s tone was gentle, but firm enough to cut through the growl in Rio’s chest. “Not tonight. You’re half-broken, bleeding, and if you try to chase after her in this state, you’ll be dead before dawn. And I’m not explaining that to Agatha when she’s herself again.”</p><p>Rio’s lips parted, her throat working, but no words came. Only a low rumble vibrated in her chest.<br/>Wanda softened, just barely. She spread the blanket across the long couch and tugged a pillow into place, her movements brisk but precise. </p><p>“Truth be told, I wasn’t prepared to have a wolf in my house. But—” her mouth curved faintly, rueful “—I suppose I’ll have to make do.”</p><p>That startled another sound from Rio, rough and strangled, somewhere between a huff of laughter and a snarl. She dropped her gaze, but the corner of her mouth twitched like she couldn’t quite hold it back.</p><p>“Good,” Wanda said, satisfied. She gestured toward the couch. “Lie down before I change my mind.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, pride flickering in the set of her shoulders, but exhaustion won out. She eased herself onto the couch, clutching Agatha’s shawl against her chest like a talisman. The blanket slipped over her a moment later, tucked around her with Wanda’s surprisingly gentle hand.</p><p>Wanda lingered a moment, watching her settle. Rio’s eyes stayed open, wide and unblinking in the lamplight, fixed on the ceiling as though any blink might let Agatha slip further away.</p><p>“I’ll find her,” Wanda said quietly. “I’ll find her, and we’ll bring her back. Until then…” She let her hand rest briefly against Rio’s shoulder. “You’re safe here.”</p><p>Rio made a low sound in her throat — softer this time, almost grateful — and curled herself tighter beneath the blanket, her fist still gripping the shawl.</p><p>Wanda blew out the lantern, leaving only the fire’s glow to light the room. She moved to her chair at the table, the Darkhold’s shadow heavy in her mind, and for the first time she admitted to herself what she had already known:</p><p>Until Agatha was freed, Rio was hers to look after.</p><p><br/>The fire had burned low, its embers glowing faintly against the dark. Rio’s breaths were deep and uneven where she lay curled on the couch, Agatha’s shawl clutched against her chest, one hand twitching now and again as though even in sleep she fought unseen battles.</p><p>At the table, Wanda turned another page.</p><p>Her candle guttered in its dish, the flame throwing warped shadows across her hands, across the ink-stained spines piled high around her. The books she’d pulled were the ones she wasn’t supposed to keep, scraps of lore she had salvaged before the council could strike them from record. Fragments on mind-binding, theories on tethered magic, counter-rites that had never been tested.</p><p>None of it was enough.</p><p>She leaned her forehead into her palm, eyes closing briefly. <em>If Evanora holds the Darkhold</em>… The thought itself tasted bitter. There were no clean counters to that. Only risks. Only ruin.</p><p>Her gaze drifted then, unbidden, to the couch.</p><p>Rio shifted in her sleep, her brow furrowed even in rest, lips pressed thin. She looked wild and fragile all at once — a creature forged for survival but not for solitude. Wanda felt the weight of it in her chest: <br/>Agatha had always steadied her, always translated the world into something survivable. Without her, Rio was raw, untethered. And for tonight, that responsibility fell to Wanda.</p><p>Wanda exhaled slowly, pushing her book aside. The room was too quiet. Too heavy. And then—</p><p>The air changed.</p><p>It was subtle at first, like the faintest prickle across her skin. The hairs at the back of her neck rose. She straightened, her breath catching. The candle flame leaned as though drawn by an unseen current, though no draft stirred.</p><p>Wanda closed her eyes, reaching with that old, strange instinct that had guided her all her life.</p><p>Something pulsed. Not outside. Not in the tower. Not even in the Darkhold. But deeper — threaded into the fabric of the world itself.</p><p>It was not like the tether of mind-binding, cold and cruel. This was different. Warm. Restless. New. <br/>Something stirring where nothing had been before, weaving its own place in the pattern.</p><p>Her eyes snapped open, her hand tightening around the table’s edge.</p><p>“What are you?” she whispered, though no one was there to answer.</p><p>The feeling swelled, brief but undeniable, before slipping beneath her senses again — hidden, but not gone.</p><p>Wanda stared into the fire, her chest tight. She had felt many kinds of power in her life, but never this. Something not made, not summoned. Something born.</p><p>Her gaze slid back to Rio, who shifted restlessly beneath the blanket, clutching Agatha’s shawl like it was her heartbeat.</p><p>Wanda swallowed, the pieces circling her mind without settling. She didn’t know what had moved through the air, only that it was tied to Agatha and Rio both.</p><p>And whatever it was, it was strong.</p><p>Strong enough, perhaps, to change everything.</p><p>————</p><p><br/>Two weeks passed in Salem, though time felt fractured, broken into uneasy silences and stolen glances.<br/>Agatha had been seen often enough to quell whispers, but always in the same way: at Evanora’s side. </p><p>Her gait was steady, her hands folded, her expression blank as a shuttered window. She never spoke. Her eyes, once sharp with wit or fire, seemed fixed on some horizon no one else could see. And when she was dismissed, she drifted back into her mother’s shadow like a moth to flame.</p><p>The city had begun to murmur. Agatha Harkness, once feared for her independence, now nothing more than a silent figure in her mother’s retinue. To some, it was proof of Evanora’s strength. To others, a quiet horror they dared not name aloud.</p><p>For Rio, it was torment.</p><p>She hadn’t left the couch in days. She lay curled beneath Wanda’s blanket, Agatha’s shawl clutched so tightly against her chest the fabric was wrinkled and damp from tears. Her breath came shallow, uneven, sometimes breaking into little whimpers in her sleep. More often than not she woke herself with them.</p><p>Althea lingered in the doorway, watching. Cora had climbed up beside Rio earlier, placing a bright stone in her hand the way she always did, whispering soft nonsense into her ear. But even Cora’s chatter, once enough to stir the faintest smile, met only silence. Rio had let the child curl against her, but her eyes stared blank at the wall, hollow and unblinking.</p><p>When at last Cora grew heavy with sleep, Althea gathered her gently into her arms and tucked her away in the small bed by the fire. Then she turned back, her throat tight.</p><p>Lilia was bent over Wanda’s books at the table, muttering as she traced old script, her lantern casting long shadows across her face. She didn’t notice the tears gathering in Althea’s eyes until Althea spoke, voice breaking low.</p><p>“She’s dying without her.”</p><p>Lilia looked up sharply, her brows drawing. “Althea—”</p><p>But Althea shook her head, pressing a hand against her chest as though the ache there might spill out if she didn’t. </p><p>“No. Look at her.” She gestured helplessly toward the couch, toward Rio’s still, curled body.</p><p> “She’s fading. Piece by piece. Every day Agatha walks the streets with those empty eyes, every day she doesn’t come back to her — it’s killing her.”</p><p>Her voice cracked, and she pressed her lips together, but the words tumbled out anyway, weighted with memory. <br/>“When my husband went to sea, and the storms swallowed his boat, they brought me nothing but a coil of rope and a torn bit of sail. No body, no grave, just absence. That grief hollowed me, mother. It was a wound that never closed.”</p><p>She turned, her eyes wet, her voice trembling. “But even that was easier than this. Because I could mourn him. I could lay him to rest in my heart. Rio doesn’t have that mercy. She sees Agatha’s face still — alive, breathing — but not hers. Not her. And it’s tearing her apart.”</p><p>For a moment, the room was silent save for Rio’s uneven breathing, a faint whimper breaking the stillness.</p><p>Lilia’s face softened, her dark eyes shadowed. She rose and crossed to Althea, laying a steady hand on her arm. “We will bring her back,” she said quietly. “For both of them.”</p><p>But Althea’s gaze returned to Rio, and her heart twisted. She wasn’t sure there would be much left of the wolf by the time they did.</p><p> </p><p>In the shadows of the Archives, Wanda and Lilia had set themselves to the task no one else dared. Scrolls and fragments, half-burned notes and forbidden records, were combed through by lantern light. </p><p>Every spare hour, every excuse to linger in restricted stacks, was taken.</p><p>“Mind-binding leaves no visible tether,” Lilia muttered as she traced faded lines with her fingertip. “If we cannot see the leash, how can we cut it?”</p><p>“Every spell has an edge,” Wanda replied, though her tone was grim. “Even the Darkhold’s. We only need to find where it frays.”</p><p>They worked in whispers, careful never to let their urgency bleed beyond the stone walls. Suspicion was currency in Salem, and Evanora had more than enough to spend.</p><p>It was Wanda who began to notice the cracks. Council meetings felt… different. The voices of lesser members, once sharp with self-interest, now sounded too uniform, their words too neatly in line with Evanora’s. Their eyes carried the same glazed stillness she had seen in Agatha’s — faint, but there.</p><p>“She’s branching out,” Wanda told Lilia one evening, voice taut with certainty. “She’s not content with her daughter alone. She’s begun bending others. The weak ones first, the ambitious ones — those who think it an honour to echo her voice.”</p><p>Lilia’s face hardened, her hands curling into fists. “If she spreads her leash into the council itself, Salem is lost.”</p><p>“And Agatha with it,” Wanda said softly.</p><p>They shared a long, heavy silence, the weight of what they had not yet found pressing down like stone.</p><p>And above them, in the highest tower, the Darkhold pulsed faintly in the dark, as though amused by their efforts.</p><p> </p><p>The council tower was hushed, the hour late, Salem’s streets muffled beneath fog. In the high chamber, shadows swelled and curled where the Darkhold hovered open on the council table, its pages breathing with faint, living ink.</p><p>Agatha stood at the centre of the room, hands limp at her sides, eyes glazed with the distant, unfocused sheen Evanora had grown accustomed to. A daughter emptied of will, reshaped into something useful.</p><p>Evanora paced slowly, her cane tapping the stones, her wolf pelt dragging behind like a banner. Corvin shifted on the rafters above, his dark eyes following her every step.</p><p>“Fetch the scroll,” Evanora commanded, her tone casual, as if testing her own leash. She gestured toward a shelf in the far corner.</p><p>Agatha turned at once, her body moving fluidly, but as she crossed the chamber, a change swept the air. Outside, the thick blanket of clouds shifted. A pale glow bled through the high windows, and then — suddenly — the full moon emerged, washing the chamber in silver.</p><p>Agatha stopped.</p><p>Her head lifted slightly, her chest rising with a sharp, unsteady breath. For a heartbeat her eyes cleared, sharpened, their glaze falling away. The trance broke. She blinked, her lips parting as though a word — Rio’s name, a plea — was about to spill free.</p><p>Evanora froze, her knuckles tightening around her cane.</p><p>The light lingered only a moment before the clouds dragged back across it. Darkness reclaimed the chamber. Agatha’s shoulders sagged, her gaze glazed once more. She reached out, took the scroll from the shelf, and returned with it as though nothing had happened.</p><p>Evanora accepted it in silence, her eyes fixed on her daughter’s face.</p><p>That shouldn’t be possible. Not under the Darkhold’s binding. The spell was absolute — it had endured since childhood, unbroken through years, through distance, through every attempt at defiance. No tether snapped at the call of moonlight. None ever had.</p><p>And yet, she had seen it.</p><p>Corvin gave a low, rasping croak from above. The Darkhold’s pages rippled, restless, as though mocking her.</p><p>Evanora smoothed her hand across its cover, but her smile was thin, brittle. “The moon,” she murmured. “So that’s where the cracks form.”</p><p>Her gaze swept back to Agatha, cold and sharp as glass. “Something stirs in you, child. Something I did not place there.”</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. “And I will root it out.”</p><p>Agatha stood motionless once more, eyes vacant, but deep inside her chest, the ember the moonlight had sparked still glowed, faint but unyielding.</p><p>For the first time in years, Evanora felt it — the faintest crack of unease.</p><p><br/>Wanda’s cottage smelled of smoke and herbs, but the air inside was heavy, unmoving. Rio sat on the couch with her knees drawn tight, Agatha’s shawl twisted in her fists. Her eyes were flat, fixed on nothing, her chest rising in shallow, uneven breaths.</p><p>Wanda leaned in the doorway, watching. She had seen grief before — hers, others’ — but this was something different. This was love starving for a place to go. Left alone, it would hollow Rio out until nothing was left.</p><p>She crossed the room slowly and crouched before her. </p><p>“Rio,” she said, voice even, carrying the weight of patience. “You can’t stay shut away like this. Grief will rot you faster than hunger.”</p><p>Rio didn’t move.</p><p>Wanda touched the edge of the shawl, just lightly. “I know why you cling to it. It smells of her. It feels like her. But you’re not meant to waste away clutching scraps. Wolves are not made for cages, no matter how small.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw flexed, her throat straining as though words tried to climb out but couldn’t. She shook her head once, sharp and trembling.</p><p>Wanda’s gaze softened. “Listen. The market is today. Crowded, yes. But alive. The noise, the faces, the air itself — all of it reminds you the world has not ended, even if it feels as though it has.” She drew a slow breath. “You don’t need to speak. You don’t need to smile. You need only walk.”</p><p>Rio’s lashes lowered, her breath hitching.</p><p>“If Agatha were here,” Wanda went on, “she would not let you curl into shadow. She would order you up, as she always has. You know her fire — she would not stand for this. And you…” Wanda tilted her head, eyes sharp. “You would obey, because it is her.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers tightened around the shawl, her chest shuddering.</p><p>“She cannot be the one to do it now,” Wanda said, quiet but firm. “So I will. Up, wolf-girl. One step. That is all I ask.”</p><p>For a long moment Rio was stone. Then, slowly, she lowered her legs to the floor. Her bare feet touched the boards, and she stood, shoulders hunched but moving.</p><p>Wanda inclined her head, approval quiet but clear. “Good. The first step is always the heaviest. The second will come easier.”</p><p>She moved toward the door without hurry, trusting Rio to follow. When they stepped into the morning, the air was cool, damp with mist. Rio flinched at the brightness, clutching the shawl to her chest, but she kept walking.</p><p>Wanda did not smile, but her voice was steady as stone. “That’s it. Grief is carried, not buried. Walk with me, and carry it into the world. That way it cannot carry you.”</p><p>Her gaze softened, and for a moment she seemed to speak as much to herself as to Rio. “Someone once told me — what is grief, if not love persevering? Remember that. This ache you feel… it means the love is still alive.”</p><p>And so they moved through Salem’s crooked streets — one woman heavy with love and loss, the other steady beside her, guiding her back toward life step by step.</p><p>Neither knew what waited at the market.</p><p>The market was crowded but subdued, voices pitched low, the air carrying the tang of herbs and smoke. Wanda kept a steady pace, weaving through the stalls, trusting Rio to follow close at her side.</p><p>At a vendor’s table she paused, fingertips brushing over carved wooden charms strung on twine. She held one up, squinting at the etching, considering its craftsmanship. When she turned to show Rio—</p><p>Her breath caught.</p><p>The girl was gone.</p><p>Wanda’s heart gave a sharp thud. She set the charm down and scanned the press of bodies, her pulse quickening. For an instant she imagined the worst — Evanora’s hand, Agatha’s blank face, shadows stealing her away in plain sight.</p><p>Then she spotted her.</p><p>Rio sat cross-legged on the cobblestones, shoulder to shoulder with a ring of children gathered in front of a small puppet stage. Her eyes were wide, fixed on the painted wooden figures bobbing back and forth, voices pitched high and silly behind the curtain.</p><p>Wanda exhaled slowly, the panic easing into something else.</p><p>She stepped closer, just as Rio leaned forward — and then, to Wanda’s startled amusement, ducked her head behind the stall, peering intently to try and see what magic moved the dolls.</p><p>The puppeteer yelped, batting gently at her with a prop stick, the children giggling. Rio jerked back, blinking, utterly confused.</p><p>Wanda’s laughter broke free, light and sudden. She caught Rio by the arm, pulling her gently upright. </p><p>“Now now” she said, still smiling. “Don’t spoil the illusion. Let the magic be what it is.”</p><p>Rio looked at her, bewildered, but something eased in her face — the faintest flicker of awe lingering there, softer than Wanda had seen in weeks.</p><p>For a moment, the heaviness lifted. Wanda let herself smile fully, squeezing Rio’s arm.</p><p>And then the crowd shifted.</p><p>The laughter died. Heads turned. Voices dropped to nothing. Wanda felt it before she saw it, the familiar prickling along her spine.</p><p>Evanora.</p><p>Her black cloak swept through the market like a shadow made flesh, the wolf pelt draped over her shoulders, Corvin circling overhead. And at her side — pale, distant, unblinking — was Agatha.</p><p>Wanda’s smile vanished. Her hand tightened instinctively on Rio’s arm.</p><p>The moment of levity was gone. Shattered in an instant.</p><p>Rio stiffened the moment her eyes found Agatha. A low whine escaped her, small and broken, pulled straight from her chest before she could swallow it down. Her body leaned forward, muscles coiled, every part of her straining to go to her.</p><p>Wanda’s grip tightened, holding her back.</p><p>Across the market, Evanora’s mouth curved into a thin, knowing smile. She slowed her steps just enough to let her gaze settle on them. A smirk — sharp, cruel — and then she turned her head as though they weren’t worth her notice.</p><p>Agatha never looked their way. Her gaze was fixed forward, vacant, unblinking, her body moving as if carried on invisible strings.</p><p>“Agatha—” Rio’s voice cracked, little more than a rasp of breath. She jerked against Wanda’s hold, the shawl slipping from her grip as she tried to break free.</p><p>Wanda caught her with both hands, pulling her back into the press of the crowd. “No,” she hissed, voice low and urgent. “Not now. Not here.”</p><p>Rio struggled, her eyes wide, her face twisted with anguish, another whine breaking loose — raw, desperate. Her hands clawed toward Agatha, as though reaching might be enough to drag her back.</p><p>Wanda cupped Rio’s face, forcing her dark eyes to hers. “Listen to me. That is not her. Not as you know her. Evanora has her bound tighter than rope. If you rush to her now, you’ll only bleed for it.”</p><p>Rio’s chest heaved, her breath ragged, fury and grief tangled in every shudder of her frame.</p><p>Wanda’s voice softened, but the weight of command still carried in it. “Agatha isn’t herself. Do you hear me? She isn’t herself.”</p><p>For a heartbeat, Rio’s body remained rigid, trembling with the fight to resist. Then, slowly, her shoulders sagged. A broken sound slipped from her throat, more sob than growl.</p><p>Wanda pulled her close, one steadying arm around her. She felt the storm still thrumming in Rio’s muscles, the wild instinct to fight and to run. “Not today,” she whispered against her temple. “Patience. We will get her back — but not like this.”</p><p>When Wanda dared to glance up again, Evanora was watching still, that smirk sharp as a blade. And Agatha — gods help them — Agatha walked on, never once turning her head.</p><p>Wanda didn’t let go until the weight of Evanora’s presence passed fully from the square. Only then did she pull Rio into a narrow side street, the noise of the market fading behind them.</p><p>Rio was shaking. Her breath came hard, almost ragged, her fists clenched tight at her sides. She tried to twist free, to go back, but Wanda pressed her firmly against the wall, her own voice low but steady.<br/>“Look at me.”</p><p>Rio’s dark eyes lifted, wild and wet.</p><p>Wanda gentled her tone. “I know you want to run to her. I know every bone in you is screaming for it. But Agatha isn’t… Agatha right now. Evanora has her in chains you can’t see. To chase her in this state would only feed Evanora’s game.”</p><p>Rio’s throat worked. She made a guttural sound, sharp with frustration, then shook her head violently. She pressed her hand to her chest, then down to her middle again, her brows drawn as though the gesture itself might explain what her mouth could not.</p><p>Wanda frowned. “Your chest? Your stomach?”</p><p>Rio nodded hard, then jabbed a trembling finger back toward the market where Agatha had vanished. She tried again, forcing the sounds out, broken and halting. “Di—ff… erent.”</p><p>The word cracked, rough with strain. She repeated it, louder this time, almost pleading. “Different. Smell.”</p><p>Wanda stilled.</p><p>Her gaze swept over Rio — the way she trembled, the desperation burning through her grief — and then she thought of Agatha, blank-eyed beside her mother. She had felt something too, hadn’t she? A shimmer in the aura, not Evanora’s, not Agatha’s. Something other.</p><p>Her pulse quickened. “Different,” she echoed softly, more to herself than to Rio.</p><p>Rio nodded fiercely, her breath hitching as though relieved to finally be understood. She pressed her fist tight against her middle again, insistent.</p><p>Wanda caught her hand, lowering it gently. Her own voice was calm, though her mind raced. “It could be the curse. Some shift in the way it grips her. Or…” Her eyes darkened with thought. “Or something else entirely.”</p><p>She released Rio’s hand and drew a long breath, steadying her thoughts. “I’ll need to consult the texts. See what has been written of bindings like this, of the way they warp the body as well as the mind. If there is a way through, it may lie buried in ink and parchment.”</p><p>Rio’s chest heaved, but she leaned back against the wall, exhausted. The single word she had managed still trembled in the air between them — <em>different</em>.</p><p>Wanda rested a hand briefly on her shoulder, the gesture firm, grounding. “You’ve given me something to work with. Hold on to that. Hold on to her.”</p><p>Her eyes swept the misted street, narrowing. “Evanora’s hold may be strong, but it is not flawless. Whatever this difference is… it could be the key.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, clutching Agatha’s shawl to her chest once more. Wanda stood guard beside her, silent now, already turning over in her mind the paths the archives might reveal — and the shadowed possibilities of what Rio had sensed.</p><p>The hearth at Lilia’s cottage had burned low, shadows stretching long across the walls when Wanda slipped through the door. Her hood was drawn tight, her face pale in the flicker of firelight.</p><p>Lilia rose from her chair at once, her sharp eyes narrowing. “You came late. What’s happened?”<br/>Wanda untied her cloak, her movements brisk but careful. She set a bundle on the table — Agatha’s shawl, folded tight, worn soft at the edges.</p><p>Rio’s scent still clung to it, but so too did Agatha’s.</p><p>“She’s still under Evanora’s hand,” Wanda said, her voice low. “We saw them today, at the market. Agatha walked beside her like a doll. She never even looked our way.”</p><p>Lilia’s mouth pressed into a thin line. “I expected no less.”</p><p>“There’s more.” Wanda’s gaze flicked toward the back room, where the faint sound of Althea’s lullaby carried as she settled Cora to sleep. Only when the song faded did Wanda continue. </p><p>“Rio scented something. Not Evanora. Not Agatha herself. She didn’t have the words, but she kept saying ‘different.’ ‘Different smell.’ She was… desperate with it.”</p><p>Lilia tilted her head, studying Wanda. “Different how?”</p><p>“That’s what I don’t know.” Wanda’s voice wavered, uncharacteristically uncertain. “It could be the curse reshaping her. Some dark tether I cannot yet see. But…” She hesitated, the weight of her own thought pressing against her tongue. “It could be what you spoke of. Weeks ago. Shadow and moon. Witch and beast. Woven as one. Something… born.”</p><p>Lilia stilled, her hands curling slowly against the wood of the table. The fire popped, sparks flaring, then fading back into ash.</p><p>“You think she might carry something,” she said at last, her voice careful, as though testing the words against the air.</p><p>Wanda nodded, though the gesture was taut, reluctant. “I think it possible. But possibility is not proof. And we cannot afford to be wrong.”</p><p>Her hand lifted to the shawl, fingers smoothing over the worn fabric. “That’s why I came to you. Your sight runs deeper than mine. If there is even a glimmer of truth in it, we must know. For Agatha’s sake. For Salem’s.”</p><p>Lilia’s gaze dropped to the bundle. “Something of hers?”</p><p>“Yes. She wore it the night she sent Rio away. Rio’s been clutching it since.” Wanda exhaled, her composure slipping for just a moment. “She’s sleeping now. I couldn’t wake her for this. Not until we know more.”</p><p>Silence stretched between them, the crackle of the fire the only sound.</p><p>Finally, Lilia reached out and laid her hands upon the shawl. Her fingers pressed lightly, reverently, as though she were not touching cloth but a tether to something far greater. She closed her eyes.</p><p>The firelight caught the curve of her cheek, the furrow of her brow.</p><p>Wanda leaned in, her voice low, edged with both fear and hope. “Look into her, Lilia. Tell me if the prophecy lives in her womb.”</p><p>Lilia drew a breath, steadying herself, and began.</p><p>She inhaled once, slow and deep, and when she exhaled, the air shifted. The faint smell of sage, sharp and bitter, rose from the hearth though no herbs had been thrown in. Shadows stretched unnaturally long across the floor, and the lantern flame bent toward her as if pulled by an unseen tide.</p><p>Wanda stood perfectly still, her breath caught. She had seen divination work before — omens, fragments, glimpses — but this felt heavier, like standing at the edge of a storm.</p><p>Lilia’s lips moved soundlessly at first, the whisper of words in a tongue older than Salem. Then, her voice found form:<br/>“Shadow and moon… Witch and beast… woven as one…”</p><p>The shawl trembled faintly beneath her hands.</p><p>Wanda’s eyes narrowed. “What do you see?”</p><p>Lilia’s brow furrowed, her breath growing uneven. She pressed her hands harder into the fabric, as though grounding herself. “I see… a thread. Faint, but strong. Not Agatha’s. Not Evanora’s. Something new, spun between.”</p><p>The flames flared bright, then guttered low, throwing the room into half-darkness.</p><p>“A pulse,” Lilia whispered. “Not yet born, not yet shaped, but… alive. Small as a spark, but with the power to burn through stone.” Her voice shook now, reverence and fear entwined. “It is tied to her, and through her, to the beast.”</p><p>Wanda’s throat tightened. “Rio.”</p><p>“Yes.” Lilia’s eyes flew open, dark and gleaming. “This is what the council fears. Not Agatha, not the wolf, but what they have made together. The prophecy does not whisper of death, but of birth. A child. A bond that could unmake the council’s chains.”</p><p>The shawl slid from her hands as though cast off, falling limp across the table. The fire roared suddenly, unprovoked, then shrank back to embers.</p><p>Wanda’s fingers curled tight against her skirt. Her heart pounded, a thousand thoughts sparking at once — fear, awe, grief, and something dangerously like hope.</p><p>She forced her voice steady. “If it is true… if Agatha carries such a child… then Evanora must not know.”<br/>Lilia nodded grimly. <br/>“If she senses even a whisper of it, she will not try to snuff it out.” Her voice lowered, heavy with dread. “She will try to claim it. To twist it into a weapon of her own making.”</p><p>Wanda’s chest tightened, her mind leaping at once to the image of Agatha’s blank face, Evanora’s hand curled like a leash around her life. The thought of that same shadow stretching over something unborn — something innocent — made her stomach turn.</p><p>“She has the Darkhold,” Wanda murmured. “If she believes this child carries power, she will bend all her will to binding it before it ever draws breath.”</p><p>Lilia’s jaw tightened. “Yes. Evanora has never destroyed what she could instead control.”</p><p>The shawl lay limp between them, carrying nothing but the scent of its owner, and yet it felt suddenly heavier than stone.</p><p>Wanda’s hand curled into a fist. “Then we must protect it — whatever it is, whoever it is. Not only from her chains, but from her hunger.”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes flicked to the dying embers of the fire, the glow catching sharp across her cheek. “If the prophecy speaks true, this child is the key to Salem’s fate. And in Evanora’s hands, it will not be salvation.”</p><p>The silence that followed was thick, each woman hearing what the other did not dare speak aloud.<br/>Wanda broke it first, her voice low but unshaken. “Then she must never know.”</p>

<p>The chamber was steeped in shadow, the Darkhold hovering open at the oak table, its pages shifting as if some unseen hand turned them. A low hum filled the air, restless and constant, like the breath of something ancient.</p><p>Agatha sat rigid near the hearth, her hands folded neatly in her lap, her gaze fixed on nothing. She looked like a statue carved in pale wax — still, silent, emptied by the spell that bound her.</p><p>Evanora moved toward her slowly, the tap of her cane echoing in the stone chamber. The wolf pelt dragged behind her, a reminder of conquest with every step.</p><p>She circled her daughter without a word, sharp eyes flicking over her face, her shoulders, the faint quiver of her breath. The leash of the Darkhold was tight; she could feel it in the marrow of Agatha’s silence. <br/>And yet… something was wrong.</p><p>Her aura.</p><p>It shimmered faintly beneath the spell, a flicker that did not belong. Subtle, fragile — but it was there. <br/>Evanora leaned closer, inhaling as though scent alone might reveal it. The air around Agatha pulsed with a rhythm not her own, something threaded through her veins like silver thread in black cloth.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. “Moonlight,” she murmured, voice low and sharp. “But you are no child of the moon.”</p><p>Agatha did not answer. Her eyes remained blank, her hands still folded, though the tiniest tremor worked through her fingers.</p><p>Evanora’s suspicion deepened. Moon-magic had been outlawed generations ago, stamped out by the council. It had no place here — certainly not in Agatha, her daughter of shadow and flame. And yet… there it was. Something stirring beneath the leash, something that should not be.</p><p>Her lips curved in a humourless smile. “What are you hiding from me, child?”</p><p>The Darkhold stirred behind her, its pages quivering, a ripple of shadow passing across the room as though in response.</p><p>Before Evanora could probe deeper, the heavy door creaked open. A council messenger slipped inside, bowing low, voice taut with urgency.</p><p>“Lady Harkness,” she said. “The Red Witch. She was seen again, leaving Lilia’s home…without the wolf.”</p><p>Evanora’s gaze flicked sharply from Agatha to the girl, her face unreadable.</p><p>“Good,” she said at last, her tone smooth as silk. “Continue to watch. Bring me word of every step they take.”</p><p>The messenger bowed again and hurried out, the door slamming shut behind her.</p><p>For a long moment, Evanora remained standing before Agatha. Her eyes narrowed, her hand hovering just above her daughter’s brow, but she did not touch.</p><p>“Moonlight in your blood,” she whispered, voice a thread of suspicion curling through the air. “We will see what becomes of that.”</p><p>Corvin croaked harshly from the mantel, feathers rustling as the Darkhold’s shadows writhed against the stone walls.</p><p>And Agatha sat silent, unmoving, the flicker buried deep beneath the spell — for now.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>The cottage was dark when Rio startled awake, breath catching in her throat. The fire had gone to embers, the shadows thick. For a moment she reached blindly beside her, hand searching the couch cushions. <br/>Empty.</p><p>The shawl.</p><p>Her chest clenched. She sat upright, palms dragging over the coarse fabric of the couch, the floorboards beneath her feet. Nothing. The scent was gone. Agatha’s scent — the one thing that had steadied her, that had made the nights bearable.</p><p>Her heart thundered, panic already rising. Wanda. Wanda had taken it. She remembered now — the hush of her voice, the bundle carried out beneath her cloak. Rio’s throat tightened, a low, broken sound escaping her chest.</p><p>The spiral came fast. Without the shawl, it felt like Agatha herself had vanished all over again. The ache gnawed, hot and sharp, clawing up from her belly into her chest until she could barely breathe.</p><p>She couldn’t stay here. Not one more moment.</p><p>Her body moved before thought could catch her. She shoved open the door and stepped barefoot into the night, the cool mist slick against her skin. The city was quiet, asleep, but she did not stop to think. Her steps carried her through crooked streets, faster, sharper, until the tower rose ahead of her like a black wound against the sky.</p><p>Her breaths came ragged now, her hair plastered damp to her face. She didn’t notice the chill, didn’t notice the scrape of stone beneath her feet. All she saw was the tower.</p><p>Agatha was there. She had to be.</p><p>Rio pressed a palm to the outer wall, her chest heaving, eyes lifting to the high windows where a faint light glimmered. She thought she saw a shadow move within, a shape still and pale against the fire’s glow.</p><p>Her body shuddered. The word ripped from her throat before she could stop it — raw, broken, half-growl, half-plea:<br/>“Agatha.”</p><p>The mist curled tighter around her, swallowing the sound. But still she stood there, hand flat to the cold stone, as if she could reach through it with will alone.</p><p>For a moment — a fleeting instant — she thought she felt something stir in answer. A shift, faint as breath, from the chamber above.</p><p>Her nails scraped against the stone. Her eyes burned with tears.</p><p>“Stay,” she whispered again, hoarse and desperate.</p><p>The tower loomed silent. No answer.</p><p>But Rio didn’t move. She rooted herself at its base, her whole body trembling with need and defiance, waiting for even the smallest sign that Agatha could still hear her.</p><p><br/>The chamber was still, thick with the stench of smoke and shadow. Agatha lay atop the blankets, her body stiff, her gaze fixed on nothing. Evanora’s spell held her in that half-life — not asleep, not awake, her will swallowed by the Darkhold’s leash.</p><p>Her breaths came shallow, one after the other, the rhythm unnatural.</p><p>And then — something shifted.</p><p>Moonlight pierced through the slit of the tower window, silver and sharp. It cut across her body, pooling low over her abdomen. For a moment, the glow seemed to answer something deep inside her, pulsing faintly — not hers, but within her.</p><p>The leash tugged hard, trying to keep her bound, but the light was stronger. Agatha’s lips parted. A tremor ran through her hand, the first voluntary movement in days. Her throat worked, and in a voice cracked and paper-thin, she breathed one word:</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>The sound was barely more than a breath, but it slipped through the stone, carried on the tether between them.</p><p>Below, at the base of the tower, Rio’s head snapped up. Her whole body went rigid, ears straining. </p><p>She had heard it. </p><p>She had heard her.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Her voice was a growl now, thick with desperation. </p><p>The rage rose hot and fast, colliding with the moonlight that spilled over her shoulders. </p><p>Her body trembled, bones pulling, muscles straining. </p><p>The wolf ripped free.</p><p>Fur burst across her skin, claws gouging the stone beneath her. Her howl split the night — raw, furious, a vow and a warning all at once.</p><p>Inside the chamber, Corvin startled. The raven gave a shrill, rasping cry, wings beating violently as he launched from the mantel. His black eyes gleamed, locked on Agatha.</p><p>Evanora stirred from her seat by the fire, her head snapping toward the bed. She had felt it — the snap in her leash, the whisper of defiance. Her mouth twisted into something cold and sharp.</p><p>“The mongrel.”</p><p>And below, the wolf was waiting.</p><p>Rio’s eyes burned gold as she prowled in the mist, hackles high, muscles coiled to strike. </p><p>Every fibre of her being screamed one truth — she would not let Evanra take Agatha, not while she still drew breath.</p><p>The tower itself seemed to tremble with the force of it: moonlight above, wolf below, bound by a thread of love even the Darkhold could not sever.</p><p>The howl tore through Salem like a blade. </p><p>It rattled the glass in the council tower, shook dust from the rafters, and for the first time in decades, Evanora flinched.</p><p>Her hand tightened on her cane. <br/>Corvin shrieked from the mantel, wings flaring wide.</p><p>Evanora’s eyes snapped to Agatha on the bed. The faint shimmer of moonlight still pulsed low across her abdomen, the smallest flicker of resistance in her blank face.</p><p>And that howl — raw, feral, drenched in anguish — had reached her. Evanora could feel it, a pull against her leash.</p><p>Her lips thinned. <br/>“No,” she whispered, more to herself than to her daughter. She struck her cane against the stone, and the Darkhold shuddered. Shadow poured from its pages like smoke, winding around Agatha’s body, searing into her veins.</p><p>The moon’s glow guttered. Agatha’s lips stilled. The leash snapped tight once more.</p><p>Evanora exhaled slowly, though unease pricked at her chest. </p><p>“You are mine,” she murmured, as if to remind both Agatha and herself. “Not even the beast will break you.”</p><p>Below, the wolf rampaged.<br/>Rio’s golden eyes blazed as she crashed into the first line of Salem’s guards. Their blades caught torchlight but shook in unsteady hands.</p><p>“Stop her!” one cried, Evanora’s command curling in his voice.</p><p>But Rio was fury unbound. She ripped through steel and spell alike, claws flashing, teeth sinking deep. Bodies fell hard to the cobbles, cries cut short in wet gasps.</p><p>Council wardens poured from the side streets, cloaks whipping, hands sparking with hexes. They threw fire, shadow, wind. Rio plowed through all of it, her grief given teeth and her love given claws.</p><p>Every step forward was a vow: nothing would keep her from Agatha.</p><p>The streets of Salem quaked with her wrath. Windows slammed. Doors bolted. Still she came, a storm in wolf’s skin. She leapt, hauling herself up the tower wall, claws sinking deep into the stone, leaving gouges in her ascent.</p><p>Above, Corvin’s cries split the night in warning.</p><p>Wanda was just leaving Lilia’s lane when she heard it — that howl, followed by the clash of steel, the roar of fire, and the shrieks of dying men.</p><p>Her heart lurched. “Rio.”</p><p>Without hesitation, she ran. Her boots slapped against slick cobbles, her cloak flying open behind her. Mist curled at her ankles as she sprinted toward the square, the glow of warding spells already lighting the air like lightning.</p><p>When she rounded the last corner, she stopped short — breathless.</p><p>The tower loomed ahead, its base littered with broken bodies. The wolf clung halfway up the stone wall, claws dragging deep scars as she climbed, her eyes burning gold. Each warding spell cast against her sputtered and died.</p><p>And above, in the highest window, Wanda thought she glimpsed the faint silhouette of Agatha, still as death.</p><p>The raven shrieked again, circling in the storm-wracked sky.</p><p>Wanda pressed a hand to her chest and whispered, “Gods help us.”</p><p>Then she pushed forward, toward the wreckage, toward the tower, toward the storm gathering inside.</p><p>Evanora stood in the high chamber, the Darkhold open on the table, its pages alive with writhing shadows. Corvin shifted uneasily on the mantel, wings half-spread. The walls seemed to hum with the pulse of the spell.</p><p>Then it came — claws tearing at stone, a guttural snarl that carried through the tower like thunder.</p><p>Evanora’s smile flickered, faint but tight. For a heartbeat, the sound pressed against something she had not felt in years: unease. She masked it quickly, moving to place herself just behind Agatha, who stood vacant and rigid, her eyes dull under the Darkhold’s leash.</p><p>“Good,” Evanora murmured. “Let her rage. She will find only obedience.”</p><p>The door burst open in a shower of splinters. Rio hurled herself through, her massive frame bristling with blackened fur, teeth bared, golden eyes burning. She skidded to a halt, claws raking the stone as her gaze locked on Agatha.</p><p>Her growl deepened, but it broke halfway into something softer, rawer — a keening sound that trembled with recognition and ache. </p><p>She lowered her head, inching forward.</p><p>Evanora’s smile sharpened. She slid one hand across Agatha’s shoulder, as if presenting her like a shield. “You will not touch me, wolf. Not while she answers to my hand.”</p><p>Rio snarled, muscles coiling to spring. But she held back, her body trembling with the restraint that tore at her insides. Her tail lashed once, her ears flattening.</p><p>“Impetum,” Evanora whispered.</p><p>Agatha’s arm lifted like a marionette. <br/>Magic seared through the chamber, a bolt cracking against the floor where Rio had stood an instant before. <br/>Stone shattered, dust choking the air.</p><p>Rio lunged aside, claws scraping, another growl rumbling in her chest — half fury, half plea.</p><p>“Again,” Evanora hissed.</p><p>Agatha’s hand snapped forward. Another blast, then another. <br/>Rio twisted, dodging, her paws gouging the stone floor as she tried to close the gap. <br/>She didn’t strike back, not once — only evaded, her eyes locked desperately on Agatha’s face.</p><p>The third bolt caught her flank. The wolf yelped, the sound ripping through the chamber as her body slammed against the wall. </p><p>She crumpled, breath shuddering, blood seeping through her fur.</p><p>Evanora’s laughter slid cold through the silence. “Even beasts know not to bite the hand that commands.”</p><p>“Enough.”</p><p>The word rang like iron.</p><p>Wanda stood in the shattered doorway, her cloak torn, hair tangled with mist and ash. Her eyes flicked once to Rio, struggling to her paws with a growl low and broken, before locking on Agatha — and then the book that pulsed behind her.</p><p>Her heart clenched.</p><p>“The Darkhold,” she whispered, voice taut with dread.</p><p>Evanora’s smirk curved cruel. “So the Red Witch recognises it. Good. Then you’ll understand why your warnings mean nothing.”</p><p>Wanda stepped into the room, slow, steady, every muscle wound tight. “I understand perfectly. You’ve chained your own blood with it. And I promise you — she will not stay bound.”</p><p>The Darkhold’s pages rippled, shadows spilling across the stone like ink spreading through water. Evanora’s eyes gleamed, black fire flickering in their depths.</p><p>“Then watch, Maximoff,” she hissed. “Watch her strike down the wolf she loves.”</p><p>Behind her, Agatha’s arm rose again.</p><p>And Wanda braced herself, the storm already breaking between them.</p><p>The chamber shook with the weight of magic. Dust drifted from the rafters as stone groaned, already scarred by scorch marks where Agatha’s spells had torn through the air.</p><p>Wanda planted herself between the two women — one vacant-eyed, puppet-like, her hands alight with deadly force; the other, a wolf bleeding and trembling, crouched low but unbroken.</p><p>“Evanora,” Wanda’s voice rang sharp, controlled even as her chest burned. “Stop this. You’re tearing apart what you cannot hold.”</p><p>Evanora only smiled, the Darkhold’s pages thrumming at her back. “On the contrary. I’ve never held her more firmly.”</p><p>Her hand lifted, and Agatha’s body jerked forward, arms raised, another blast already forming. The air vibrated with raw power, bright and searing.</p><p>Wanda flung up her own hand. Scarlet energy spiralled out, colliding with Agatha’s violet flare in a deafening crack. Sparks hissed across the floor, scorching the stones.</p><p>“Agatha, hear me!” Wanda cried, her voice pushing against the roar. “This isn’t you — it never was!”</p><p>But Agatha’s face was blank, her eyes glassy. She stepped forward, hurling another volley. Wanda caught it, twisting it wide, the energy burning into the wall in a spray of molten stone.</p><p>Behind her, Rio dragged herself upright. Her flanks heaved, blood matting her fur, but her golden eyes never left Agatha’s face. She let out a low, keening whine that rose and broke — grief, love, desperation wound into one.</p><p>“Do you see?” Evanora taunted. “She will obey me until nothing remains of her but ash. And the beast will die by her hand.”</p><p>Agatha’s palms blazed with light, brighter, hotter. </p><p>The chamber filled with the shriek of power condensing into one final, killing strike. </p><p>Wanda threw up both hands, scarlet walls of energy forming around Rio, but even she knew it would not hold.</p><p>“Agatha, no!” Wanda shouted.</p><p>The spell left Agatha’s hand — a bolt like lightning, white and violet, tearing through the chamber toward the wolf.</p><p>Rio did not flinch. She stood still, chest rising, eyes locked on the woman she loved.</p><p>And in that instant — Agatha faltered.</p><p>Her gaze brushed Rio’s, glassy eyes meeting molten gold. Something shivered in her chest, a crack running jagged through the Darkhold’s leash.</p><p>From her abdomen, faint at first, then blooming — a glow. </p><p>Indigo light, soft but unrelenting, spilled outward.</p><p>Agatha gasped, the sound small, human. The spell sputtered in her hand, bursting apart in harmless sparks. She clutched at her middle, staring down in horror and awe as the glow grew stronger, radiant, pulsing like a heartbeat.</p><p>Evanora’s eyes gleamed, fixed not on Agatha’s tear-streaked face but on the indigo glow burning steady in her abdomen. <br/>That light — ancient, impossible, alive — had no place in Salem. And yet here it was, pulsing from her daughter’s womb like a second heartbeat, defying even the Darkhold’s leash.</p><p>“Ah,” she breathed, cane trembling in her grip, though not from weakness. “So this is what you’ve been hiding from me.”</p><p>Corvin gave a harsh croak, feathers flaring, as if echoing her realisation.</p><p>The Darkhold hovered above the council table, its pages fluttering though no wind stirred. Symbols crawled across the parchment like living ink, reshaping themselves in hunger, sensing what Evanora sensed — power to be claimed.</p><p>She extended her hand, and the shadows spilling from the book writhed toward her like serpents, wrapping around her wrist, eager.</p><p>Wanda shouted, stepping forward. “Don’t you dare—”</p><p>But Evanora was already moving. She raised her cane and struck it once, sharply, against the stone floor.<br/>The sound rang out like a crack of thunder.</p><p>Shadows surged from the Darkhold, thick and oily, coiling across the chamber floor. They reached for Agatha, curling around her ankles, her arms, her throat. She gasped, the last flicker of clarity in her eyes vanishing as the leash tightened again, harder than ever before.</p><p>The glow from her abdomen pulsed brighter, fighting against the shadows, but the Darkhold’s magic twisted and smothered, turning that light into a cage. The indigo throbbed through the black coils, veins of defiance swallowed in darkness.</p><p>Rio snarled, a guttural, broken sound, and leapt — but the shadows lashed out, forming a barrier, slamming her back against the scorched wall with a sickening crack. Her claws raked uselessly against the shifting dark, her growl reverberating with both fury and despair.</p><p>Evanora’s lips curved into something like a smile, cruel and hungry.</p><p>“With me, child,” she whispered, not to Agatha alone, but to the unseen spark within her.</p><p>The cane struck a second time.</p><p>The Darkhold screamed — the sound of tearing parchment, shrieking voices, the cries of the damned, all at once. </p><p>A cyclone of shadow rose around Evanora and Agatha, pages tearing free and spinning like black fire, inscriptions glowing blood-red before vanishing into smoke.</p><p>The air itself warped. <br/>Light bent inward. <br/>The chamber seemed to collapse, its edges folding in on themselves as though reality were being rewritten.</p><p>“Agatha!” Wanda’s voice split the storm, her hands blazing red as she hurled a surge of power toward them.</p><p>But it struck nothing — the shadows absorbed it, drank it, devoured it.</p><p>The indigo light flared one last time, blinding, searing — then was smothered, pulled into the maelstrom.</p><p>Evanora’s cane tapped a final, delicate beat against the stone.</p><p>And with a roar that shook the tower to its bones, the shadows folded inward — and were gone.</p><p>The chamber fell into a silence so sudden it rang in the ears. Only the acrid stink of smoke and iron remained.</p><p>Rio dragged herself up, eyes wild, a low whine breaking from her throat as she staggered toward the empty space where her mate had stood. Wanda’s chest heaved, her scarlet light faltering out, her expression stricken and furious all at once.</p><p>Evanora, Agatha, and the Darkhold were gone.</p><p>The silence that followed was crushing.</p><p>Rio’s ears pinned back, her sides heaving, claws scraping across the stone as if she could dig them back from the void. Her nose pressed to the floor where the shadows had swallowed them, nostrils flaring wildly — but the scent was gone, snuffed out like a candle.</p><p>Her whole body shook. A low whine broke from her chest, rising into something higher, keening, grief and rage entwined. It echoed up the walls of the tower, raw enough to make the stones tremble.</p><p>Because it wasn’t just Agatha’s scent that had been stolen from her. There had been something else — faint, new, fragile — tangled within it. A thread she hadn’t understood until the instant it was torn away. <br/>Now she knew.</p><p>Her mate was gone. And with her, the smallest, newest part of them both.</p><p>Wanda stood frozen, scarlet light still faintly flickering around her hands. Her heart clenched at the sound Rio made, at the way she pressed her body desperately to the stone, as though she could claw time itself open and drag Agatha back through. Wanda’s throat tightened, her breath shuddering.</p><p>She stepped forward, crouching low, her voice quiet but fierce. “I know.” Her hand hovered just over Rio’s trembling shoulders. “I felt it too. There’s… something inside her. A life. A child.”</p><p>Rio’s head jerked up, golden eyes blazing, a broken whine spilling out — questioning, disbelieving.<br/>Wanda nodded, grief threading through her steady tone. “Yes. Yours and hers. That’s what Evanora has taken.”</p><p>Rio’s chest heaved, a guttural sound tearing from her throat — not rage alone, not grief alone, but something deeper, primal. Her whole body quivered with it, the truth landing like a strike to the heart.</p><p>Wanda’s jaw tightened, her voice turning grim. “Evanora will try to twist it. To claim what was never hers. But listen to me, Rio.” She leaned closer, her eyes fierce, unwavering. “That child is your bond. Your blood. No Darkhold can sever that forever.”</p><p>The wolf’s growl softened into a low, anguished rumble, her body crouched low as though ready to spring after them even now.</p><p>Wanda reached out, finally resting a steady hand against her fur. “We’ll find them. Both of them. Before Evanora can turn that light into shadow.”</p><p><br/>————</p><p> </p><p>The world re-formed with a sickening lurch — stone and firelight twisting into the damp salt air of the coast.</p><p>Evanora’s mansion rose out of the cliffside like a wound against the sea, its windows hollow, its walls slick with centuries of storms. The echo of the cane’s strike still rattled in Agatha’s bones as she stumbled forward, landing hard atop the familiar black-marble floor.</p><p>Her chest heaved. Her hands pressed to the ground, fingers trembling. And then — suddenly, painfully — the fog in her head cracked.</p><p>She gasped, clutching at her chest as though a fist had loosened around her heart. Her gaze darted wildly across the chamber, seeiing not shadows and commands but herself — her own hands, her own breath, her own body.</p><p>But then she froze.</p><p>A warmth pulsed low in her belly, strange and steady, unlike anything she had ever felt before. She pressed a hand there, blinking hard, her lips parting in disbelief. Not sickness. Not dread. Something else.</p><p>Her breath hitched, tears springing sharp to her eyes. “Oh gods… Rio—”</p><p>Her mind flooded at once — Rio’s face, Rio’s hands, the way her body had pressed against hers in desperate comfort, in love. The heat of her tears blurred the room. “Yours,” she whispered, her voice breaking. “Ours.”</p><p>Behind her, the Darkhold stirred on its pedestal, its pages shivering as if in recognition. Shadows bled outward across the floor, curling around her ankles like chains.</p><p>Evanora’s cane struck the stone once, sharp. “So. There it is.”</p><p>Agatha whipped toward her, fear and fury colliding in her chest. “Stay away from me!” She raised her hand, a spark of violet power flaring, born not from her mother’s leash but her own defiance.</p><p>Evanora only smiled, cold and knowing. “You think a flicker of will can defy this?” Her hand swept toward the book. The Darkhold’s pages yawned open wider, ink spilling across them like smoke. “The leash may fray, but it never breaks.”</p><p>Agatha screamed, hurling the blast forward. It struck the chamber wall in a flash of violet fire, stone crumbling where it hit — but Evanora was untouched, her shadow rising taller, thicker, coiling with the Darkhold’s rot.</p><p>Agatha staggered, clutching her belly. She could feel the spark thrumming against her mother’s chains, fighting, resisting. Her tears burned hot on her cheeks. “You will not touch it. You will not touch us.”</p><p>Evanora’s voice lowered, cruelly soft. “Oh, my sweet girl. You think this spark makes you stronger. But all it has done is give me more to claim.”</p><p>The Darkhold’s shadows surged, snaring Agatha’s wrists, her ankles, her throat. She writhed, choking, violet light flaring and failing in her palms.</p><p>Her mind blurred, the warmth in her belly the last thing she felt before it was smothered beneath the book’s weight.</p><p>And then her eyes went glassy again.</p><p>Evanora stepped closer, satisfaction gleaming in her gaze. She cupped her daughter’s chin, tilting her blank face upward. “Yes. That’s better. Obedient. Silent. Mine.”</p><p>She looked down briefly to where Agatha’s hand still hovered unconsciously at her abdomen. Her smile sharpened. “We’ll make good use of what you carry.”</p><p>Outside, the sea slammed against the cliffs, roaring like it knew the storm Salem could not yet see.</p><p> </p><p><br/>————</p><p> </p><p>The tower stank of smoke and blood. The floors were cracked, scorched, strewn with the wreckage of wardens who had fallen beneath tooth and claw. The stone still rang with the echo of Rio’s howls, a sound that had carried through the city like a storm.</p><p>Now, silence — except for the murmur of gathering voices.</p><p>Wanda knelt by Rio’s side, hands stained from staunching the wound Agatha had left. Her own chest heaved, both from battle and from what she knew must come next.</p><p>Through the shattered doorway, lanterns bobbed in the dark. The people of Salem were gathering, their steps hesitant, their whispers sharp.</p><p>“Did you hear it? A beast loose in the tower—”<br/> “They said it tore through ten wardens—”<br/> “Not a wolf at all. A monster.”</p><p>Rio lifted her head, ears pricked, nostrils flaring as the voices pressed closer. Her dark eyes flicked to Wanda, raw with confusion and hurt, chest rising and falling fast.</p><p>Wanda’s gaze swept the broken stairwell, the shadows beyond. She felt the fear thickening in the air, the way dread could so quickly turn to fury. She had seen it before, in Trials and in wars. Salem was no different.</p><p>“Rio,” she said quietly, urgent but steady. “You must listen to me now.”</p><p>Rio’s muscles tensed, claws scraping faintly against the stone. Her gaze darted toward the door, where the lantern glow grew brighter.</p><p>“They will come for you,” Wanda pressed, her voice low but fierce. “Not because of what you are, but because they are afraid of what they saw. Blood on stone. Witches broken. Their fear will not care for truth.”</p><p>A whine escaped Rio, low and guttural, her head shaking as if to deny it. Her eyes were wild — pleading — as though Wanda could tell her it wasn’t so.</p><p>But Wanda’s expression was grave. Her throat tightened as she reached, steadying a hand against Rio’s furred shoulder. “This rage, this sorrow — it is love, twisted by loss. I see that. I know it. But they will not. To them, you are only a beast.”</p><p>Her voice cracked, just faintly. </p><p>Wanda blinked hard, but the sting in her eyes would not be swallowed back. A tear slid down her cheek before she could stop it.</p><p>The voices outside swelled, the crowd pushing nearer.</p><p>“Monster—” “Dangerous—” “Keep it from the city—”</p><p>Wanda’s grip tightened, her eyes wet now. <br/>“You must go. Flee, before their fear finds fire. If they see you, they will not ask questions. They will bind you. Or worse.”</p><p>Rio’s breath came ragged, her whole body trembling. She looked toward the broken stairwell, then back to Wanda, a sound rising from her chest — low, mournful, torn between fury and refusal.</p><p>Wanda’s tears fell freely now, streaking her face, but her voice was steady as iron. </p><p>“I know you don’t want to leave. You want Agatha. So do I. But you cannot help her if you are chained in their dungeons, or slain in their streets. Live, Rio. That is how you protect her now.”</p><p>The first lanterns flared against the threshold, shadows of the townsfolk stretching long across the stone. The outrage in their voices sharpened.</p><p>Wanda leaned close, her forehead brushing against Rio’s fur, her whisper breaking around her tears. </p><p>“Run. For her.”</p><p>The wolf’s eyes glistened. She loosed a low, keening sound that rattled through the ruined chamber, then turned. With a bound, Rio leapt through the shattered wall into the night beyond, vanishing into the fog.</p><p>The crowd surged forward just as Wanda straightened, cloak snapping in the wind of Rio’s departure. Her cheeks were still damp, her eyes red.</p><p>All they saw was the Red Witch standing alone in the ruin.</p><p>Gasps rippled through the townsfolk as they caught sight of her tears. And in their fear-clouded minds, it made sense: the Red Witch wept not for the beast, but for the fallen. For Salem.</p><p>And so, while Rio disappeared into the mist, Salem’s eyes fixed only on Wanda.</p><p>She raised her hand, calling for silence.</p><p>“Listen to me,” she said, her voice cutting sharp through the din. </p><p>“This destruction is not the wolf’s doing alone. Evanora Harkness commands a darkness you cannot see — a darkness that has ensnared her own daughter. Agatha has been taken, bent to her mother’s will. That is the enemy. Not Rio.”</p><p>Murmurs rippled, but they were laced with suspicion, not understanding.</p><p>“She tore through the wardens!” someone cried. “I saw her teeth rip them apart—” “Blood on her claws—”</p><p>Fear had turned the crowd deaf. Their eyes burned with the kind of panic that sought an easy enemy, a shape to blame.</p><p>Wanda tried again, louder, her voice echoing against stone. “Evanora uses the Darkhold. That book is the rot eating Salem! The wolf was only trying to protect Agatha—”</p><p>“Lies,” a voice cut in, cold and sure.</p><p>The crowd parted as Councillor Mora stepped forward, her pale cloak brushing the blood-stained stone. Her face was taut with disdain, but her eyes gleamed with grim satisfaction.</p><p>“I warned you all,” Mora said, her tone ringing like a verdict. “From the first day that beast set foot in Salem, I told you what danger she posed. Now you see.” She gestured toward the ruin — the shattered walls, the fallen wardens, the claw marks scoring the stone. “This is her nature. Not protection. Not love. Violence.”</p><p>“No,” Wanda snapped, stepping forward. Her tears glistened still, but her gaze was steel. </p><p>“You are blind, Mora. Rio has been twisted by grief, by Evanora’s hand. She is not the threat. Evanora is—”</p><p>But Mora silenced her with a raised hand, turning instead to the townsfolk. “This city bleeds because of a mongrel we welcomed within our walls. Do not be swayed by soft words. You saw it yourselves. You heard its howls.”</p><p>The crowd shifted, muttering darkly. Fear curdled into rage.</p><p>Mora’s voice sharpened. “Hear me now. A bounty will be placed upon the wolf. Alive, if possible. Dead, if not. Whoever delivers her will be rewarded by the council’s purse.”</p><p>The words hit like a hammer. Gasps rippled through the crowd, followed by grim nods. Already, the weight of suspicion and fear was hardening into resolve.</p><p>Wanda’s stomach sank, dread coiling through her. She stepped forward, fury sparking in her tone. </p><p>“You would turn your people against one who has only ever fought for us? Who has loved one of our own more fiercely than any council decree could demand?”</p><p>But Mora only tilted her head, the faintest curl of a smile ghosting her lips. <br/>“Then let the wolf prove you right, Red Witch. If she is not the monster I claim, let her stay hidden. If she is, Salem will drag her into the light.”</p><p>The words hit like a hammer. Gasps rippled through the crowd, followed by grim nods. Already, the weight of suspicion and fear was hardening into resolve.</p><p>From the back of the square, another voice cut through — high, clear, trembling.</p><p>“NO!”</p><p>Heads turned as Althea pushed her way forward, Cora clutching her skirts with both fists, Lilia close behind them. The child’s cheeks were wet, her small chest heaving as she cried out again, louder this time:</p><p>“Don’t hurt Rio!”</p><p>The words struck the air like stones against glass. A hush fell, brief but sharp, as the sight of a child’s tears cracked through the fever of the crowd.</p><p>Althea gathered Cora into her arms, her own face tight with fear and fury. “You will not make her your scapegoat,” she said, her voice low but steady, though her hands shook against her daughter’s back.</p><p>Lilia’s dark eyes swept the council, her jaw set. “If you cast a bounty on Rio, you damn Salem to chasing shadows while Evanora tightens her leash around your throats.”</p><p>But Mora only frowned, unmoved. Her voice cut cold. “The child doesn’t understand. But the rest of you do. Obey, or Salem falls.”</p><p>The mutters rose again, low and uneasy, the fragile moment of hesitation already breaking.</p><p>Wanda’s heart clenched at the sight of Cora’s tears, at Althea’s shaking defiance. She stepped closer to them, her voice dropping to a rasp.</p><p>“They won’t listen,” she whispered. “Not yet. Fear has deafened them. We must keep Rio safe until the truth forces its way through.”</p><p>Cora pressed her face into her mother’s shoulder, still sobbing, her small voice muffled but insistent. “Don’t let them hurt her…”</p><p><br/>The cries of the crowd still rang in her ears — mongrel, beast, bounty — but Rio no longer lingered to listen. Her body burned with grief and rage as she surged forward, muscles straining, paws pounding against the earth.</p><p>The wards that lined Salem’s boundary flared as she hit them — crackling barriers of ancient council magic, meant to keep wolves out. For a heartbeat, pain seared her body, light scalding across her fur. She threw her head back and howled, the sound tearing through the trees, shaking leaves from the branches.<br/>And then, with a final desperate push, she broke through.</p><p>The wards hissed and spat behind her, their glow dimming, fractured by her raw, untamed magic. The forest swallowed her, damp earth cool under her paws, the scent of moss and rain filling her lungs. She ran without knowing where, only away. Away from their torches, away from Mora’s decree, away from the place that had turned on her.</p><p>But she could not run from the visions.</p><p>Agatha’s face burned against her mind with every stride. Agatha’s laugh — sharp, wicked, warm — rising like sparks. Agatha in her arms, her body pressed close in the dark, their breaths tangled, skin against skin. The memory of it was so vivid it cut sharper than any blade.</p><p>Her chest heaved, but still she ran.</p><p>Another image struck, unbidden. Agatha’s face softened, not with defiance or wit, but with something gentler. A baby cradled in her arms — small, fragile, impossibly new. Rio had never dreamed such things for herself, had never let her heart shape that kind of hope. But the vision clung, stubborn as the moon’s pull, glowing faintly against the shadows of her grief.</p><p>She stumbled for half a step, her claws skidding in the dirt. The image lodged in her chest, heavy, aching. A baby. Hers? Theirs?</p><p>Her howl broke from her throat again, raw and guttural, echoing through the trees. It wasn’t rage this time, but longing — a cry to the moon itself, to whatever force had set this path before her.</p><p>The forest gave no answer. Only the night, deep and endless, and the drum of her own heart.</p><p>Still, she ran.</p><p>And behind her ribs, where grief had hollowed her for weeks, something small and unfamiliar flickered to life — not hope, not yet. But the shadow of it.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The morning broke heavy with fog, curling low over Salem’s rooftops. Smoke from the ruined tower still lingered, carried slow on the damp wind. From their place in the shadow of a shuttered stall, Wanda and Lilia watched the square fill.</p><p>Wardens assembled in grim lines, armour dulled with soot, their spears strapped tight across their backs. Horses stamped and snorted, breath steaming in the cold air. Salem’s people crowded behind them, whispering, voices sharpened with fear.</p><p>“They’ll flush her from the woods.” “She’ll tear us apart if she comes back.” “Best to strike first.”</p><p>Wanda’s hood shadowed her face, but her scarlet gaze flicked to every voice. She could feel it gathering in the air — not grief, not even outrage, but something worse. A single spark away from fury.</p><p>Beside her, Lilia’s jaw was tight. “They’ve already chosen their monster.”</p><p>“They’ll regret it,” Wanda murmured, her voice low, meant only for Lilia. “She’s wounded, grieving, but not weak. If they find her, Salem will see blood in both directions.”</p><p>Lilia didn’t answer. Her gaze tracked the wardens as their captain lifted a horn to his lips. The sound that followed was long and low, vibrating through the fog, sending the horses into restless stamps.</p><p>The hunt had begun.</p><p>Neither woman spoke until the last of the crowd dispersed.</p><p>“Come,” Lilia said at last, her voice low. “Cora will need us.”</p><p>The hearth in Lilia’s cottage burned bright, but the air inside was heavy. Althea sat by the fire, her face pale with worry, rocking Cora against her chest. The little girl’s cheeks were blotched from tears, her fists still balled as though she could hold the world together with nothing but her grip.</p><p>The moment she saw her grandmother, Cora squirmed free of Althea’s arms and ran to her, clutching at her skirts.</p><p>“They’ll hurt her,” she sobbed, words tumbling out broken, frantic. “Grandmother, they’ll hurt Rio. You have to stop them. You have to—”</p><p>Lilia knelt at once, gathering the child close, her own hands steady even as her heart twisted. “Hush, my little star,” she whispered, stroking Cora’s hair. “Breathe. Let me hear you breathe.”</p><p>But Cora shook her head hard, tears spilling anew. “She’s good. She’s <em>good</em>. They don’t know. They don’t <em>see</em>. But I do. I saw her play with me, I saw her love Agatha. Please—please don’t let them—”<br/>
Her voice broke on the plea.</p><p>Wanda had moved to stand close, her arms folded, her eyes shining in the firelight. She crouched beside them, her voice quiet, certain. “No harm will come to her if we can stop it. That much I promise.”</p><p>Cora looked up at her, eyes swollen and desperate. “Promise?”</p><p>Wanda swallowed, the tightness in her throat breaking just a little. She touched two fingers to the child’s cheek. “On my life.”</p><p>Lilia’s gaze met Wanda’s over the girl’s head, their unspoken thought passing clear between them: <em>Whatever it takes</em>.</p><p>Then Lilia kissed Cora’s crown and eased her gently into Althea’s arms again. She rose, her back straight, her jaw set in the firelight. “We will keep her safe,” she said, her voice carrying like an oath. “From Salem. From Mora. From Evanora. No matter the cost.”</p><p>Wanda straightened as well, her crimson gaze catching the flames. “Then we stand together. For Agatha. For Rio. For what waits to be born.”</p><p>Cora sniffled, her tears slowing, though her small body still trembled. She burrowed into Althea’s shoulder, clutching tight, but her words — soft, stubborn — lingered in the room.</p><p>“Don’t let them hurt her.”</p><p>The vow hung in the air long after she had fallen quiet, binding them all as surely as any spell.</p><p>The cottage had grown quieter after Cora’s sobs finally eased, but the silence was heavy, not restful. <br/>
Althea hummed low to her daughter, rocking gently, while Lilia stood at the window, arms crossed, watching the mist creep against the glass. </p><p>Wanda remained at the table, the shawl still folded there between them, her fingers brushing the fabric as though it could steady her thoughts.</p><p>“She will not last long without Agatha,” Lilia said at last, her voice pitched low so as not to disturb Cora. “Rio’s spirit is tied too tightly. Wolves do not survive when their mate is torn from them.”</p><p>Wanda’s jaw tightened, her eyes red-rimmed but burning. “Nor will Agatha last under Evanora’s leash. The longer the Darkhold binds her, the deeper the roots take.” She drew in a breath, sharp, deliberate. “We cannot save them apart. We must save them together.”</p><p>Lilia turned, her gaze sharp. “And how do you propose we unravel a spell no witch dares touch?”</p><p>“The child,” Wanda answered, the word heavy as stone. She did not flinch, though her throat worked as she said it. “What grows in her… it is more than flesh and blood. Rio scented it. You saw it yourself in the divination. It is prophecy given form. And prophecy is the one power Evanora has never truly bent to her will.”</p><p>Lilia’s lips pressed thin. She remembered the thread she had glimpsed — small, but pulsing with impossible strength. A spark waiting to set fire to everything it touched.</p><p>“If that child is the key,” Lilia said carefully, “then Evanora will feel it soon enough. And if she feels it, she will try to claim it.”</p><p>“Which is why we must act first.” Wanda leaned forward now, her voice taut, every syllable deliberate. “We cannot tear the Darkhold from her hands, not yet. But we can use what she cannot control. Agatha’s own blood. Her bond to Rio. And the life inside her.”</p><p>Silence pressed close. Even the fire seemed to hush, the crackle softening to embers.</p><p>From the chair by the hearth, Althea looked up, her eyes lined with worry. “And if you’re wrong? If this child is not strong enough to break the spell?”</p><p>Wanda’s hands clenched, then released, her face grim. “Then Evanora will win. And Salem will fall.”</p><p>Cora stirred at that, half-asleep, whispering against her mother’s shoulder: “Don’t let them hurt her…”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes softened at the sound, but when she looked back to Wanda, her expression was iron. “Then we begin at once. Whatever threads tie Agatha to Rio — we will find them. And when the moment comes, we will pull until the whole weave unravels.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, slow but certain. <br/>
The vow settled into the room like a spell, binding them tighter than blood.</p><p>————</p><p>The chamber of the coastal mansion was lit only by the Darkhold’s glow. Its pages breathed shadows, lines of black script slithering and reforming, casting sickly light across the stone.</p><p>Agatha lay atop the bed, her body rigid as if carved from marble. Her eyes, dull for so long, flickered now — small sparks of awareness threading back into their depths. Her lips parted on a whisper, faint, broken, but unmistakable:<br/>
“Rio…”</p><p>Evanora stiffened where she stood. Corvin croaked sharply, feathers bristling, as though he too had heard the name.</p><p>Evanora’s cane struck the floor once, a sharp crack of warning, and the shadows of the Darkhold swelled, binding tighter around Agatha’s wrists and ankles, around her chest. But still — still — her daughter’s gaze shifted, trembling with a glimmer of will that should not have survived.</p><p>The glow came next. Faint at first, like a trick of the moonlight breaking through the window. But it was no moonlight. The pale silver pulsed from within Agatha herself, radiating low and steady from her abdomen.</p><p>Evanora’s breath caught. For one heartbeat, the mask of iron certainty slipped, and something almost like awe flickered across her face. The power was raw, ancient, thrumming with the cadence of tides and the cold fire of stars.</p><p>The child.</p><p>Agatha gasped, her back arching as the light burned brighter. The spell wrapped tight around her body, but her mind… her mind pushed through, fragments of herself sparking like shattered glass. Her voice was ragged, but fierce:<br/>
“You will not… have me.”</p><p>Evanora’s hand trembled before she curled it into a fist, steadying herself. She forced her mouth into a cruel smile, though her eyes glittered with hunger.</p><p>“Oh, my foolish girl,” she crooned, stepping closer. “You think you resist me. But you are only a vessel — and what grows within you?” Her hand hovered just above Agatha’s belly, fingers trembling at the pulse of power beneath. “That is no ordinary spark. That is moon-forged. Born of shadow and beast. A child of prophecy.”</p><p>Agatha snarled, her face contorted with fury even as tears streaked her cheeks. “It’s not yours.”</p><p>The shadows surged at Evanora’s gesture, clamping Agatha’s body against the bed. She writhed, her voice breaking as she tried to cry out again, but the spell crushed the sound in her throat.</p><p>“Not yet,” Evanora whispered, her voice laced with greed, her eyes never leaving the glow. “But it will be. You cannot keep such power from me, Agatha. Not when I have the Darkhold. Not when I have <em>you.</em>”</p><p>The book flared, the ink bleeding darker, the shadows thickening until they swallowed the silver glow back into Agatha’s body. She gasped once, violently, and then her limbs went limp, pinned in place.</p><p>Evanora’s smile widened, though her heart still raced. For the first time in decades, she had felt something stronger than her own craft stir in Salem’s blood. And it was hers to claim.</p><p> </p><p>The shadows coiled tighter around her wrists, her throat, her chest — not flesh and iron but something colder, older. <br/>
They weren’t chains.<br/>
 They were commands. Every twitch of her limbs was stolen, every breath shaped by something that wasn’t hers.</p><p>She could feel herself moving — sitting, standing, turning when Evanora willed it — but it wasn’t her. Her body belonged to the Darkhold, wrapped in tendrils of black that slithered beneath her skin.<br/>
Yet somewhere in the dark, a spark burned.</p><p>Agatha clung to it, desperate, dragging her mind away from the choking black. She pressed against her own body from within, testing the limits of what the spell would allow. No movement. No freedom. Just thought.</p><p>And in that thought, warmth stirred low in her belly.</p><p><em>There you are</em>.</p><p>Her tears slid silently down her face, her head jerking not by choice but because the shadows wanted it so. Inside, she whispered. <em>Little one… gods, you’re real. You’re with me</em>.</p><p>The shadows hissed, irritated, as though sensing her focus had shifted. They tightened, sending knives of cold through her limbs. But still the spark pulsed, steady, unfazed by the Darkhold’s grasp.</p><p>Agatha clutched at it, not with hands but with will. <em>You’re fighting. Even in here, you’re fighting. Just like her. Just like Rio.</em></p><p>Her heart throbbed painfully against her ribs. She wanted to scream, to thrash, to run. But all she could do was press her palm — in her mind, not in the world — against the glow within her.</p><p><em>I’m sorry I can’t protect you. Not yet. But I will. I swear it. Whatever she does to me, whatever she tries to make me into… she can’t touch this. She can’t touch you.</em></p><p>For a heartbeat, the shadows faltered. A crack opened — not wide, but enough for her to breathe again.</p><p>And she whispered into that space: <em>You are loved. Even now, even before you draw breath. You are loved.</em></p><p>The glow flared brighter, a ripple of indigo light across her thoughts. For one dizzying instant, she almost felt her hand move, her fingers twitch. The Darkhold recoiled as if burned.</p><p>Evanora’s head snapped toward her, suspicion sharp in her gaze. But Agatha swallowed it down, let her body fall limp under the shadows’ command again.</p><p>Inside, she held the warmth close. The child had answered her.</p><p>And for the first time since the Darkhold’s grip had closed, Agatha no longer felt entirely consumed.</p><p>———</p><p><br/>
The forest pressed close around Rio, a blur of shadow and silver light. Branches clawed at her fur as she ran, paws tearing into the damp earth, her breath a ragged rhythm in the stillness. </p><p>Behind her, the faint clamour of horns and shouts echoed from Salem’s boundary — the hunt. Their torches bobbed like angry stars at the edge of the wards, their dogs baying against the night.</p><p>But Rio was smoke between trees, a phantom slipping through bramble and fog. Her wolf-body knew the wild better than any Salem warden ever could. Still, she was not running for herself. Her mind — what fragments of it she could hold against the pull of instinct — trembled with only one thought.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Her scent clung in memory, sharp as crushed herbs, warm as fire. And beneath it — new, strange, fragile — the scent that had unsettled her in the market. </p><p>Different. Not Agatha, not the curse. <br/>
Something small. <br/>
Something <em>growing</em>.</p><p>The whine slipped from her throat before she could stop it, a sound cracked open by grief. Her paws stumbled in the loam as her mind flooded with flashes:<br/>
Agatha laughing, candlelight flickering against her sharp smile. Agatha’s voice, rough with fondness, whispering in her ear. Agatha’s body curled against hers in sleep, the weight of belonging pressed into Rio’s chest.<br/>
And now, another image — one she had never dared to imagine until now. Agatha’s arms, cradling something small. <br/>
A child. <br/>
<em>Their</em> child.</p><p>The thought hit her like an arrow. She staggered, claws raking the soil, breath catching in her lungs. It was too much — joy and terror and grief all at once. If Evanora had her, if Evanora had<em> them</em>—<br/>
A growl ripped up her throat, low and dangerous. The forest shuddered with the sound.</p><p>She threw back her head, howling. Not rage, not warning — a raw, broken cry that split the night. It carried across the trees, across the rivers, into the mountains: her vow, her prayer, her desperation.</p><p>The hunters paused at the wards, their dogs whining and cowering, ears flat against their heads. But Rio did not care. She howled again, voice cracking, every note soaked with longing.</p><p>When the sound faded, the forest hushed. Mist swirled low at her paws, the moon spilling through torn clouds above. Its silver glow struck her fur, searing through her sorrow, pulling at the power buried in her bones.</p><p>Her sides heaved, her chest aching, but she lifted her head again. Her eyes burned — not with tears, but with resolve.</p><p>She would not stop. Not until she found Agatha. Not until she reached the spark she now knew beat beneath her skin.</p><p>The child.<br/>
Theirs.</p><p>She sank low, paws pressing into the moss, the hunters’ cries still distant behind her. The wolf within her steadied, sharpened. She pushed forward again, weaving into the black woods, each stride carrying her farther from Salem, deeper into the wilds — and closer to the thread of fate that bound her to Agatha and the unborn life neither of them yet understood.</p><p>The night swallowed her. The hunt would rage, the council would curse her name, but none of it mattered.<br/>
She ran for Agatha. She ran for their child. She ran until the world blurred to silver and shadow, and her heart’s vow roared louder than the blood in her ears.</p><p> </p><p>The howl had torn through the night, a sound so raw it rattled the shutters of Salem homes and sent the council’s torches flickering.</p><p>Lilia froze mid-step in her cottage, her hand stilling over the herbs she had been grinding. The pestle slipped from her fingers and clattered into the bowl. Her chest tightened, her dark eyes going wide.</p><p>Wanda, seated near the fire with an open folio, looked up sharply. “Lilia?”</p><p>But the older witch didn’t answer at first. She staggered slightly, gripping the edge of the table. The sound of the howl still reverberated in her bones, but beneath it — something else. A thread pulling, a door opening.</p><p>Her breath came uneven as her gaze went distant, unseeing. And then, words tumbled out, fractured but heavy with weight:<br/>
“Moonlight over shadow… blood bound to blood… a spark that cannot be chained…”</p><p>Wanda rose swiftly, crossing to her side, her voice urgent. “What do you see?”</p><p>Lilia’s lips trembled as the vision surged through her, unstoppable. “The wolf runs. Not away —<em> toward</em>. The child stirs, power swelling where none should yet be. They call to each other across the dark…”</p><p>Her voice broke, her grip on the table tightening until her knuckles whitened. “Evanora feels it too. She will not kill it. No. She will <em>claim</em> it. Shape it. Twist it. As she has always done.”</p><p>Wanda’s blood chilled. She steadied Lilia’s arm, trying to anchor her. “Stay with me. What else?”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes snapped to her suddenly, burning with the remnants of the vision. “If they meet — wolf, witch, and unborn flame — Evanora’s leash will weaken. That is the crack. The chance. But…”</p><p>Her breath hitched, her voice softening into a tremor. “If Evanora touches the child before we do, Salem will not survive what she makes of it.”</p><p>The room was silent but for the fire’s crackle and Lilia’s ragged breathing. Wanda’s hands tightened on her shoulders, her own eyes glistening with both fear and resolve.</p><p>“Then we will not let her,” Wanda said fiercely. “Whatever it takes, Lilia — we will not let her.”</p><p>The older witch sagged slightly, the trance fading, her body trembling from the weight of what she’d seen.</p><p>Wanda eased her into the chair, her own heart pounding, and glanced to the window where the howl had once rung.</p><p>Out there, in the dark forest, Rio was still running. Running not only for Agatha, but for the spark neither of them yet knew they carried.</p><p>And for the first time since Evanora’s return, Wanda felt the faintest flicker of hope.</p><p>————</p><p><br/>
The Darkhold lay open across the obsidian table, its pages restless as if the book itself had caught the scent of blood. The ink swam across the parchment, forming and unforming sigils of moons, wombs, and vessels brimming with unshaped magic.</p><p>Evanora stood over it, her hand braced against the edge of the table. Her breath was steady, but her eyes were alive with a hunger that made even Corvin shift uneasily on his perch.</p><p>The child was real. She had felt it quicken within Agatha — a spark where no spark should be, pulsing with moonlight and wolf-magic, power unclaimed. It had sung to her bones the moment she laid her hand over her daughter’s trembling body.</p><p>And now the Darkhold sang with it too.</p><p>Her fingers traced a curling line of script that glowed faintly silver against the black page. She read silently, lips curving into a sharp smile.</p><p>“Yes,” she murmured. “A vessel of raw essence. An unborn soul woven with prophecy. Take it in the womb, and the power curdles. Still fragile, still fractured. But if it is allowed to draw breath…”<br/>
Her smile deepened, sharp as glass.</p><p>“Then it ripens. Whole. Pure. Strong enough to bend the city, perhaps the world.”</p><p>She tapped the page once with the head of her cane, and the ink bled darker. “And I will not waste it in half-measures. Not yet.”</p><p>Behind her, Agatha lay atop the black-draped bed, shadows from the Darkhold curled tight around her wrists and ankles. Her chest rose and fell shallowly, but still the glow beneath her ribs pulsed faintly. Defiant.</p><p>Evanora’s gaze slid toward her, lingering on the faint shimmer.</p><p>“You think it yours,” she said softly, almost fondly. “But you are only the vessel. The clay. What grows inside you belongs to me.”</p><p>Corvin croaked low, as if in warning, but Evanora ignored him. Her eyes were fixed on the living script now etching across the Darkhold’s pages — diagrams of circles, incantations of binding, promises of <em>extraction</em>.</p><p>She let out a low hum of satisfaction.</p><p>“When the time comes, child of prophecy, I will take you from her arms before she ever has the chance to name you. And all this power—” she pressed her palm flat against the page, the shadows crawling eagerly up her skin— “will be mine to command.”</p><p>Her head tilted, listening to the sea’s roar outside the stone walls. The tide thundered like applause.</p><p>“Yes,” she whispered. “Let Agatha dream of freedom. Let the wolf howl at the gates. It changes nothing. The womb ripens. And when it bears fruit, I will harvest it.”</p><p>The Darkhold pulsed, satisfied.</p><p>And Agatha, eyes fluttering beneath their shadowed trance, whispered one word under her breath, almost too faint to hear:<br/>
“Rio…”</p><p>Evanora thought her daughter’s mind was gone. Bent. Broken.</p><p>And on the surface, it was true. Agatha’s body obeyed every tug of the Darkhold’s leash. She stood when commanded, walked when pulled, stilled when the pages whispered stillness.</p><p>But inside — deep beneath the black tide — something stirred.</p><p>At first it was small, a flicker no stronger than a spark against the void. Agatha had ignored it, thinking it some remnant of herself burning out. But then it pulsed again, steady, soft — <em>other</em>.</p><p>She reached for it again.<br/>
Her child.<br/>
Tears pricked the corners of her mind, though her body never moved. <br/>
Evanora would not see. Could not see. The Darkhold held her flesh like a puppet, but within, she wrapped herself around that glow and let it steady her.<br/>
<em>You are here,</em> she whispered silently, her thoughts shaping like prayer. <em>You are with me. And I will not let her take you.</em><br/>
The glow flared, spilling through her mind like moonlight piercing cloud. The shadows recoiled, hissing in the recesses of her thoughts. And where they had once smothered, the light burned small clearings of will.</p><p>For the first time since the leash had been wound tight around her, Agatha’s thoughts were her own.</p><p>Her lips in the waking world remained still, her hands limp in her lap. Evanora, bent over the Darkhold, never glanced up. She believed her daughter docile, hollowed out.</p><p>But Agatha, in the hidden chambers of her mind, <em>fought</em>.</p><p>She pulled the glow close, weaving it through herself. She thought of Rio — her warmth, her laughter, her stubborn, untamable heart — and let that love feed the spark. She thought of the child — hers, theirs — and promised in the marrow of her soul: <em>I will keep you safe. Whatever it takes</em>.</p><p>The glow answered, brighter, pulsing like a heartbeat in time with her own.</p><p>The shadows tightened again, trying to drown her in silence, but this time Agatha did not break. She bent her will around the light, holding it fast, hiding it deep where the Darkhold could not reach.</p><p>Evanora still saw only a body under her leash. She did not know the mind was no longer hers.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes stared blankly into the dark of the chamber. But within, unseen and unbroken, her soul whispered against the tide:<br/>
<em>I am not yours. Not anymore.</em></p><p>The glow was no longer only warmth — it was rhythm. A drumbeat steady and sure, pulsing inside her like the moon’s tide. It wasn’t hers alone. She felt it tether outward, faint but true, stretching past the walls of the tower, past the Darkhold’s chokehold.</p><p><em>Rio.</em></p><p>The thought rose unbidden, sharp as hunger. The glow inside her child pulsed in answer, and suddenly Agatha knew: it was not only hers. It carried two threads woven into one — her blood and Rio’s. Wolf and witch, shadow and moon.</p><p>And where the Darkhold barred her from speaking, from moving, she found she could reach.</p><p>Carefully, trembling, she poured herself into the tether. Not words, not spells — she dared not give the shadows reason to notice. Only feelings, impressions, carried on the pulse of the child’s light.</p><p><em>I’m here. I’m alive. Find me.</em></p><p>The glow flickered out into the dark like ripples across water, searching.</p><p>The shadows pressed in, suspicious, coiling tighter around her limbs. Agatha froze, breath caught. For a heartbeat, she feared she had been discovered. But Evanora, bent over the Darkhold, only murmured, lost in her hunger.</p><p>Agatha pushed again, softer this time, steady, letting the child’s rhythm carry the call outward. She pictured Rio’s face — the storm in her eyes, the rough warmth of her hands, the way her laughter once spilled into the quiet — and braided it into the signal.</p><p><em>Remember me. </em></p><p><em>Remember us. </em></p><p><em>Come.</em></p><p>Her mind trembled with the effort. Tears burned down the walls of her thoughts, unseen in her glassy eyes. The shadows clawed at her, furious, but the glow never faltered.</p><p>The child pulsed again — once, twice — stronger than before. And Agatha felt it stretch further still, tugging outward like a howl carried on the wind.</p><p>A faint certainty pressed back into her chest, wild and distant: somewhere, the wolf would hear.<br/>
She clutched the tether close, hiding it deep, whispering silently into the glow:<br/>
<em>Lead her to us. Lead her home.</em></p><p>———</p><p>The forest bled silver beneath the full moon, every branch carved in stark shadow and light. Mist clung low to the earth, curling around Rio’s paws as she moved. Her flanks heaved, breath streaming in pale clouds, every muscle strung tight from nights of running.</p><p>She slowed. Stilled.</p><p>The world shifted. Not in sound. Not in scent. Something deeper. A tremor that coursed straight through her bones, pulling her chest taut.</p><p>Her ears snapped forward, her body quaking with recognition.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Rio’s head lifted, the moon catching in her eyes. She felt it — a signal stitched through the night itself, threading through shadow and air and earth until it pierced her heart. It was not words, but a call. </p><p>Need. Desperation. Love.</p><p>And beneath it, faint but steady, came another rhythm. Small. Fierce. The heartbeat she had scented once and had never forgotten.</p><p><em>The child</em>.<br/>
Her child. Theirs.</p><p>Rio staggered a step, her paws sinking into the damp soil. She pressed her eyes shut, her body trembling as the tether pulled harder. Images surged behind her lids: Agatha’s lips shaping her name, her eyes wet with defiance, a glow pressing against shadow. Then—small hands unseen, the pulse of life not yet born but already burning bright.</p><p>A whine tore from Rio’s throat, raw and broken, shattering the hush of the forest. <br/>
A promise flung at the moon and the stars and the night itself:<br/>
<em>I will find you. Both of you. Whatever it takes.</em><br/>
The tether throbbed in answer — faint, but sure.</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped open, bright with moonfire, her breath ragged but steady now. She surged forward, paws pounding against the earth, tearing through mist and root and shadow. No longer running blind, no longer lost.</p><p>She had a path now. A direction.<br/>
The child had given it to her.</p><p>—————</p><p>The cottage trembled. Not in stone or timber, but in the air itself — a low, resonant hum that rattled the marrow.</p><p>The room bore the scars of sleepless nights. Parchment and scrolls lay strewn across the table, ink-stained quills snapped or blunted from overuse. Circles of ash marked the floor where spells had been cast and burned themselves out. Herbs hung half-crushed in bowls, their scents sharp in the heavy air.</p><p>Wanda’s head snapped up, the quill in her hand dropping soundlessly to the table. Her breath hitched. <br/>
Scarlet light flickered at the edges of her fingers, unbidden, responding to a call older than words.</p><p>Lilia turned from the window, her shawl slipping from one shoulder. Her eyes were hollowed by fatigue, but sharp still. “What is it?”</p><p>Wanda’s gaze unfocused, fixed on a point far beyond the walls. She could feel it — a tether snapping taut, the sudden flare of a will breaking through shadow. Agatha. The weight of her mind, once buried beneath Evanora’s leash, now blazing like a signal fire.</p><p>“She’s fighting,” Wanda whispered, her voice shaking with something that was not fear but awe. “Gods, she’s fighting.”</p><p>The air thickened, vibrating with an invisible rhythm. For a moment it sounded like the rush of a tide, the crack of stone splitting, and then — faint, but there — a heartbeat. Not one. Two. Woven.</p><p>Lilia pressed a hand to her chest, her lips parting as the sound seemed to echo through her bones. “Moon and shadow,” she breathed. “The prophecy…”</p><p>Wanda lifted her hands, and scarlet ribbons of energy arced outward, spilling into the dark. They coiled like rivers in the air before shooting forward, stretching through wall and mist alike. A path unfurled, alive and undeniable, pulled by Agatha’s mind calling out through the break.</p><p>“I can see her now,” Wanda said, her voice low but alight. “She cast off the Darkhold’s shroud. Not fully, but enough. She’s reaching — for Rio, for us. For anyone who will listen.”</p><p>The sigil at Wanda’s feet flared, crimson symbols burning across the floor like a map etched in fire. The scattered scrolls lifted in the current of magic, fluttering like frantic birds. Lilia stepped to her side, eyes shining, her voice steadier now. “Then we answer. We follow.”</p><p>Wanda’s jaw clenched, a tear spilling hot down her cheek. She did not wipe it away. “We bring her home,” she swore, her voice ringing like steel in the quiet. “Agatha, Rio, and the child. No shadow, no book, no curse will keep them from us.”</p><p>Lilia’s fingers brushed the air where the crimson path burned brightest, her own eyes hard with resolve. “I vow it.”</p><p>The cottage door swung open, the night alive with scarlet light. Mist curled away from their feet as they stepped into the dark, two silhouettes swallowed by storm and vow alike.</p><p>Behind them, the hearth flared suddenly — a single coal catching flame though no hand touched it.<br/>
As though Salem itself bore witness.</p><p><br/>
———————</p><p>The night’s storm broke like a beast loosed from its cage.</p><p>Wind howled through the trees, bending their blackened limbs until they creaked like old bones. Rain lashed down in sheets, stinging fur and skin alike, drenching the earth into sucking mud. The night itself seemed to roar, alive with fury.</p><p>Through it, Rio ran.</p><p>Her paws tore through the mire, claws flashing as she bounded over roots and stones. Each breath came ragged, steam curling from her muzzle into the storm. The world blurred — trees, shadows, lightning striking jagged white across the sky — but one thing burned steady in her mind.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>And beneath that name, another pulse — softer, newer, impossibly fragile. The child.</p><p>The bond thrummed in her blood like a drumbeat. She could feel it more sharply now than ever before, a thread tugging her closer with every stride. Agatha’s anguish echoed through her chest, mingling with her own, guiding her as surely as the moon above the storm clouds.</p><p>A howl tore from her throat, swallowed by the thunder. It wasn’t rage this time, but a cry to the one she sought — a call through the rain and shadow:<em> I am coming</em>.</p><p>Lightning split the sky, and for an instant the land beyond the forest revealed itself. Jagged cliffs. A sprawling black shape clinging to the coast. </p><p>Evanora’s mansion.</p><p>Rio skidded to a halt at the tree line, mud spraying beneath her paws. Her body trembled with exhaustion, but her eyes locked on the fortress. The sea crashed below, waves pounding against the rocks as if trying to batter their way inside.</p><p>Another pulse answered in her chest — Agatha’s presence, faint but unbroken, alive within those walls.<br/>
Rio lowered her head, rain streaming down her muzzle, breath heaving. Every muscle burned. Every scar throbbed. But her gaze never wavered.</p><p>The mansion loomed like a shadow carved into the cliffside, but she felt no fear. Only the wild, aching certainty that she would not leave without them.</p><p>Wind shrieked through the trees behind her, rain pounded the earth, and still she stood, a lone wolf against the storm.</p><p>Then, with a final guttural growl, Rio surged forward.</p><p>The hunt was over. The siege had begun.</p>

<p>The storm rattled the mansion to its bones.</p><p>Rain hammered the windows like thrown stones, thunder shook the beams above, and still the Darkhold’s shadows coiled tight around Agatha’s limbs, pinning her where she lay atop the bed. She had long since given up fighting the physical restraint — there was none. It was the book’s will woven into her flesh, every muscle bound in silence.</p><p>But her mind was hers. And tonight, it blazed.</p><p>The child stirred within her, a flicker of light against the Darkhold’s grip. A pulse. A spark. A force so small and yet so utterly unyielding that it shook her to her marrow. It answered her grief. It steadied her will. It was <em>hers</em> — theirs.</p><p>And then she felt it.</p><p>Like the crash of waves against cliff rock, the bond struck her chest — wild, raw, untamed. </p><p>Rio.</p><p>Her breath caught. Her eyes fluttered shut, lashes heavy with tears, as the tether tightened between them.</p><p> Across the storm, across the walls, across every shadow her mother had spun, she felt her. Closer now. <br/>Stronger. Her wolf.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered, her lips barely moving, the sound almost lost beneath the thunder. The name was a prayer, a plea, a vow all at once.</p><p>The shadows of the Darkhold hissed at the sound, writhing across her skin, tightening their hold. But the light in her belly flared in answer, indigo sparks threading through her veins, pushing back against the darkness.</p><p>Another crash of thunder — and Agatha swore she heard it, faint but undeniable. A howl. Carried on the storm. Her name written in it.</p><p>Her tears spilled freely now. “You’re here,” she whispered. “You’re—”</p><p>The shadows surged, burning cold against her wrists, cutting the words short. Evanora’s magic pressed harder, smothering, possessive. Yet even as her body arched against the restraint, Agatha’s mind refused to bow.</p><p>Because she knew. She <em>felt</em>.<br/>Her wolf was at the gates.<br/>And for the first time since the Darkhold claimed her, Agatha smiled.</p><p>Evanora froze. <br/>The curve of her daughter’s lips was small, fragile — but it did not belong. Not here. Not with the Darkhold wrapped around her like chains of shadow. Confusion prickled sharp down her spine. The girl’s eyes were glazed, her body bound, yet there it was: a spark.</p><p>A smile.</p><p>“No,” Evanora murmured, her voice low, dangerous. She rose from her seat, cane clicking against the stone floor as she advanced. “That is not for you to wear. Not when you are mine.”</p><p>She lifted the cane, silver head gleaming with a cold light. A single strike, a single word, and she would remind Agatha what she was — what she would always be.<br/>But before the blow fell, the air shifted.<br/>A sound rolled through the doorway, low and guttural, deep enough to make the glass in the windows tremble. </p><p>A growl.</p><p>Evanora stilled. Slowly, she turned her head.</p><p>In the arch of the doorway stood Rio.</p><p>Her wolf form filled the frame, fur slick with rain, muscles coiled and trembling with restrained fury. <br/>Water dripped in rivulets from her muzzle, from the tips of her ears, from claws that scraped faintly against the stone. Her chest rose and fell in great heaves, every breath hot with rage.</p><p>Her eyes burned. Not amber, not brown, but something deeper, darker — fixed unblinking on Evanora.</p><p>The growl deepened, a thunder of its own, reverberating off the walls until it seemed the whole chamber shook with it.</p><p>Evanora’s lips parted, her fingers tightening against the cane. Her heart did not falter, but her face — for the barest flicker of a moment — betrayed what she would never name. <br/>Surprise.<br/>Behind her, Agatha’s smile lingered, faint but unbroken.</p><p>And in the doorway, drenched in storm light, Rio stepped forward.</p><p>For a heartbeat, the world held its breath.</p><p>The storm battered the cliffs outside, wind howling through the tower stones, rain lashing against the windows in frantic bursts. Inside, though, the chamber was deathly still — save for the steady, rolling growl that poured from Rio’s chest, vibrating through the floor like the warning of an earthquake.</p><p>Evanora straightened, the wolf pelt slipping from her shoulders as she turned fully to face the beast in her doorway. The silver head of her cane glinted with each pulse of lightning.</p><p>“Well,” she drawled, voice smooth as glass but edged sharp. “The mongrel comes crawling back. Did you think I would not smell the blood you spilled in Salem still clinging to your fur?”</p><p>Rio’s ears twitched, but her gaze did not shift. Her muscles quivered with restraint, each line of her body wound tight as a bowstring. The growl rumbled lower, darker.</p><p>Behind Evanora, Agatha’s lips curved faintly again. It was small, nearly imperceptible, but it was real.</p><p>Evanora caught it. Her eyes narrowed. She stepped aside just enough so that Agatha sat between them, her daughter’s body still bound by the shadows of the Darkhold, glassy-eyed and rigid.<br/>“Go on, beast,” Evanora taunted softly, her smile curving like a knife. “Strike me down, if you dare. Or will you rend her instead? Will your claws carve the woman you claim to love?”</p><p>The words sliced the air, cold and cruel.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched, her eyes flicking to Agatha — just for a second. Rainwater dripped from her muzzle to the floor, pattering in a slow, steady rhythm. The sight of Agatha so still, so silent, sent a tremor through her entire frame.</p><p>Evanora saw it. She pressed her advantage, stepping closer to Agatha, her long fingers brushing mockingly across her daughter’s shoulder. “She obeys me now, as she always has. Even her body knows its leash. And when I command her hand to rise against you…”</p><p>Her eyes gleamed obsidian-dark. “She will.”</p><p>The Darkhold’s pages flared, shadows curling tighter around Agatha’s limbs, coaxing her hand upward. <br/>Her palm trembled, aimed toward the wolf.</p><p>Rio’s growl cut off for a split second, replaced by a sharp, desperate whine that cracked through the chamber like lightning. Her paws scraped against the stone as if she could hold herself rooted, as if lunging forward and holding back at once might somehow undo the trap Evanora had set.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flickered. Just for a breath. Just long enough that the smile ghosted across her lips again.</p><p>Evanora missed it — but Rio did not.</p><p>For the first time since entering, her growl eased, shifting into something else: a sound low, mournful, a plea that reverberated off the stone walls and sank straight into the silence.</p><p>The storm raged on outside, a wild chorus to the fragile stillness inside. Evanora raised her cane. Agatha’s hand steadied, shadows sparking with power.</p><p>The standoff stretched like a drawn bowstring, seconds away from snapping.</p><p>Evanora’s voice cut the air like a lash.<br/> “Strike her down.”</p><p>The Darkhold’s shadows surged, forcing Agatha’s hand outward, the energy building at her palm. Her body trembled with the weight of it, magic writhing at her fingertips like a storm held in glass.</p><p>But she did not move.</p><p>Her eyes stayed locked, glassy and unfocused, yet her hand refused to release. The command rang hollow.</p><p>Evanora’s lips curled in frustration. “Do it!” she barked, her cane striking the stone with a crack.</p><p>Still, nothing. Agatha’s arm hung rigid, bound, but unmoving. Her body obeyed the Darkhold’s grip — but her will, beneath, did not yield.</p><p>For the first time, Evanora faltered.</p><p>It was only a breath, a flicker — but it was all Rio needed.</p><p>The wolf lunged, a blur of dark fur and flashing teeth. The storm outside howled with her as she sprang forward, claws skidding sparks across the marble.</p><p>Corvin shrieked, his wings tearing the air as he dove between them. His talons slashed, his feathers beating like thunder.</p><p>But Rio’s jaws found him mid-air.</p><p>There was a crack of bone, a spray of black feathers — and then silence. The raven’s body dropped lifeless to the stones, his gleaming eyes dimmed forever.</p><p>Evanora’s face went white, shock freezing her in place. For a heartbeat she seemed smaller, diminished without the shadow of her familiar circling above.</p><p>Then rage bloomed — dark, immense, terrible.</p><p>Her hand snapped upward, the Darkhold flaring to life at her side. Shadows poured from its pages, writhing like serpents, coiling around her cane as she levelled it squarely at the wolf.</p><p>“You dare,” she hissed, her voice a tremor of fury. “You dare lay fang upon what is mine?”</p><p>Rio’s paws skidded as she landed, Corvin’s feathers still clinging to her muzzle, blood on her tongue. Her growl thundered through the chamber, deeper and more feral than before, her eyes burning with unbroken defiance.</p><p>The air crackled. The storm outside rattled the windows in their frames. Evanora lifted her cane high, shadows seething like smoke ready to consume.</p><p>The chamber exploded with power.</p><p>Evanora’s cane came down like a thunderclap, the Darkhold shuddering open behind her. Black tendrils lashed across the floor, hissing, twisting, reaching for the wolf. Rio dodged, claws scraping marble, her growl splitting the silence as she snapped through one of the shadows. It dissolved into smoke, but three more surged to take its place.</p><p>She leapt, muscles bunching, fangs bared for Evanora’s throat. A jet of dark fire erupted from the witch’s hand, striking her mid-air. Rio twisted, half-rolling, landing hard with a yelp, the smell of scorched fur filling the air.</p><p>“Animal,” Evanora spat, advancing. The shadows at her feet curled like snakes, licking up the walls, blotting out the storm’s moonlight. “You think love makes you strong? It makes you weak. Predictable. Breakable.”</p><p>Rio answered only with another snarl, lunging low this time. Her jaws snapped around Evanora’s cane, teeth grinding against silver. The impact shook the witch’s arm, rattling the floor beneath them.</p><p>But the Darkhold’s shadows surged, slamming into Rio’s ribs. She was thrown sideways into the stone wall with a sickening crack, her body crumpling before she forced herself back up, sides heaving, blood glistening at her muzzle.</p><p>Evanora smiled coldly. “And still, you fight.”</p><p>She raised her hand, the air trembling as shadows gathered for the killing blow.</p><p>The storm lashed harder now, rain needling into the cobblestones, the wind howling like an omen. Through the storm’s roar came another sound — low, guttural, echoing in every stone of Salem: a wolf’s snarl, a witch’s power clashing like thunder.</p><p>Wanda and Lilia staggered into the courtyard, cloaks whipping around them. The tower loomed above, the upper windows flashing with bursts of black fire.</p><p>Lilia’s face drained of colour. “Gods preserve us… she’s in there.”</p><p>“And so is Rio,” Wanda breathed, her voice taut with urgency. She turned sharply, eyes narrowing on the shadow-drenched chamber above. “Evanora’s holding them both.”</p><p>The ground shook beneath their feet as another blast cracked against the tower wall. A cloud of black smoke curled into the storm, acrid and stinking of the Darkhold’s magic.</p><p>“They won’t survive her alone,” Lilia said, her voice hardening.</p><p>“Then we don’t leave them alone.” Wanda seized her hand, pulling her toward the side entrance. “Come — the moon is high, the storm is ours to bend. We’ll draw on it, together. Whatever it takes.”</p><p>Their feet pounded against the slick stones, racing toward the shadows of the mansion, navigating the shaking walls until they found the alter room.</p><p>Wanda knelt in a circle of chalk and salt, her palms pressed to the floor, whispering words older than Salem’s stones. The air around her shimmered faintly, bending toward the open window where moonlight fought to break through the storm clouds.</p><p>Lilia paced tight arcs behind her, clutching a scroll with trembling hands. “This is madness,” she hissed. “Moon magic is outlawed for a reason. It bends not to us, Wanda — it devours.”</p><p>“Would you rather the Darkhold devour her instead?” Wanda snapped, her voice strained with effort. Sweat ran down her temples, her eyes glinting in the flicker of candlelight.</p><p>Lilia’s jaw clenched. She dropped to her knees opposite Wanda, laying her hands flat against the circle. Her voice lowered, fierce. “If the moon is to answer, we must both call her. Devine and scarlet. Calderu blood and Maximoff blood. Do you understand what that means?”</p><p>Wanda’s breath hitched, but her voice was steady. “It means Agatha lives.”</p><p>The air shifted. The storm outside cracked, parting just enough for silver light to spill across the room. It cut sharp through the dust and parchment, landing across the shawl still folded on the table — Agatha’s shawl, humming faintly with the residue of her essence.</p><p>The light stretched further, snaking across the chalk lines, pressing into the floor.</p><p>Both women felt it at once — raw, pulsing, otherworldly.</p><p>“Gods help us,” Lilia whispered, her voice tight with awe and fear. “It’s answering.”</p><p>“Then hold it,” Wanda commanded, her voice breaking under the weight of the pull. “Bind it to her. To Agatha. Tear her free.”</p><p> </p><p>Back in the chamber Evanora raised her cane high.<br/>“Die, wolf!”</p><p>The shadows struck, slamming toward Rio like spears. She leapt, twisting through the onslaught, but one grazed her flank, searing a line of fire across her ribs. She hit the ground hard, legs buckling, her growl faltering into a broken whine.</p><p>Evanora’s laughter cracked through the chamber. She stepped forward, cane lowering for the final strike — when the shadows at Agatha’s feet flickered.</p><p>Her body jerked, the black restraints quivering like something unseen had disturbed them. A faint glow — pale, silver — rose from her abdomen, spreading like ripples across her skin.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted. A whisper, broken but resolute, escaped.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Evanora froze, fury flashing in her eyes. “No. No!”</p><p>The Darkhold’s shadows shuddered, resisting — but something vast pressed back. The silver glow spread further, pulsing like a heartbeat, stronger with every breath.</p><p>And in the next chamber, Wanda and Lilia cried out together as the moon’s power tore through the circle, surging into the walls, into the stones themselves, racing toward Agatha like a flood.</p><p>The chamber shook with power. The shadows of the Darkhold coiled and snapped, desperate to keep their grip, but the indigo glow pressed back with every beat of Agatha’s heart.</p><p>It began in her belly — a pulse, a thrum, an ache of light. It spread outward like fire in her veins until her very skin shone with indigo moonlight, her hair lifting as though caught in a storm. The glow carved her from the dark, a figure of impossible brilliance standing against her mother’s black tide.</p><p>Evanora staggered, her eyes narrowing to slits. “No…” she hissed. “Not yet.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips trembled, her voice ragged but her own: “Mine.”</p><p>The word rang out, and the glow surged, thrumming in waves so strong the walls themselves groaned.</p><p>Rio’s golden eyes widened at the sight, her chest heaving, a low whine escaping her throat. She took a step toward Agatha, her claws scraping against the marble, transfixed by the impossible beauty of her love bathed in silvered fire.</p><p>Evanora’s gaze cut sharp. She saw the wolf falter in awe, saw her daughter slip her leash, saw the glow spreading faster than the shadows could contain. For a fraction of a second, her mouth twisted with fear.</p><p>And then with fury.</p><p>“ENOUGH!” she shrieked, driving her cane down. The Darkhold flared open at her back, pages screaming with black fire.</p><p>While Rio’s eyes were fixed on Agatha, Evanora moved. Her cane carved a vicious arc, and a blast of shadow struck like a thunderbolt.</p><p>It hit Rio square in the chest with the force of a battering ram. The sound was sickening — ribs cracking, flesh tearing — as the blast lifted her bodily from the ground. She slammed into the far wall with a shuddering crack that split the stone itself. Her body crumpled to the floor in a heap, blood seeping dark and fast across the marble.</p><p>The smell of burnt fur and iron filled the chamber. Rio tried to rise, her claws scrabbling weakly, but her legs gave way beneath her. A ragged whimper escaped her throat — low, broken — before her head fell against the stone, eyes glassy with pain.</p><p>“NO!” Agatha’s cry split the air, her glow flaring brighter, blinding in its fury. Indigo light and black fire clashed in a storm that made the tower shake, made the very air scream.</p><p>Evanora stood rooted, her mouth twisting in triumph as she raised the cane again. “You shine, Agatha — but the brighter the flame, the sweeter the ash.”</p><p>The sound of Rio’s cry ripped Agatha apart.</p><p>One heartbeat — those golden eyes, desperate, pleading, locked to hers. The next, a spray of crimson across stone as Evanora’s shadows struck true, spearing through her chest.</p><p>Rio crumpled, a broken heap on the ground.</p><p>Agatha’s scream shattered the chamber. It was raw, guttural — a sound no mortal tongue was meant to make. The walls trembled. Dust rained from the rafters. It was the voice of grief itself, given flesh and fury.</p><p>The Darkhold’s shadows coiled tighter, black tendrils binding her body, squeezing her throat, her lungs. But they could not bind her soul. Not when it burned like this.</p><p>“Not her,” Agatha gasped, thrashing against her restraints. Her body arched, her skin glowing with streaks of indigo light that spread like veins of fire. “NOT HER!”</p><p>Evanora smirked, raising her cane. “You’ll tear yourself hollow, daughter. And still she will die at my feet. Then the child inside you will be mine.”</p><p>The words struck deeper than any curse. Agatha’s breath caught, her belly thrumming with power. The glow there flared brighter, flooding her veins, climbing her throat until her eyes burned like twin moons.</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha sobbed, the name breaking against her teeth. “Stay with me, please… gods, <em>stay</em>.”</p><p>The Darkhold trembled. Its pages fluttered, as though caught in an unseen gale. Black ink bled across the parchment, writhing in protest.</p><p>And for the first time, Evanora faltered. Her smirk thinned, her eyes flicking toward the book as it quivered against her control.</p><p>“Impossible…” she hissed, tightening her grip on the cane.</p><p>Agatha’s voice rose, ragged and furious. “You will never take her from me! She is my family. <em>Not you</em>. Never you.”</p><p>The chamber roared with indigo fire. Shadows screamed, writhing as they tried to pin her, but her anguish was fuel — grief transmuted into pure, unbreakable rage. The child’s power surged with her own, thrumming in defiance, every pulse a drumbeat of rebellion.</p><p>Evanora flinched back a step. Just a step — but Agatha saw it.</p><p>The flicker of fear.</p><p>Her laughter came then, jagged, broken, but burning with fury. “You feel it, don’t you? Your leash frays, Mother. You think me your puppet — but I am fire. I am <em>moonlight</em>.”</p><p>Her body convulsed, glowing brighter, the air around her rippling with raw magic. The Darkhold’s chains quaked, straining, as though they might snap entirely.</p><p>And still her gaze was fixed on Rio — crumpled, bleeding, the light dimming in her golden eyes.</p><p>Agatha’s tears seared hot trails down her cheeks as her scream ripped loose once more, power crackling at her fingertips, her fury shaking the walls themselves.</p><p>Evanora raised the cane again, but her hand shook. Just slightly. Enough for Agatha to see. Enough for Agatha to know — her mother, for all her arrogance, for all her shadows, was afraid.</p><p>And Agatha’s rage only grew.</p><p>The chamber pulsed with ruin. Smoke coiled from the cracked stone, the Darkhold’s scream rattling the very air. Shadows clawed at Agatha’s skin, desperate to pull her back down, but she would not yield — not anymore.</p><p>Across the floor, Rio’s wolf body heaved in shallow, ragged breaths, her blood seeping into the cracks, staining the stone black. Her eyes still found Agatha’s, wide and pained, as if begging her not to give in.</p><p>Something inside Agatha tore open. A scream ripped free from her chest, breaking into sobs, her voice cracking with anguish.</p><p>“Enough!”<br/>Her tears blazed as they fell, indigo light burning brighter with each drop. Her body shone like the moon torn from the heavens, light coursing through her veins until her skin glowed with fire. The shadows around her hissed, recoiling as if seared.</p><p>Evanora sneered, though a flicker of unease crossed her face. She slammed her cane into the ground, shadows surging forward in a tidal wave.</p><p>But Agatha raised her hand. The light flared outward, splitting the darkness in two. Her voice thundered, ragged but fierce:<br/>“You call yourself my mother—” Her eyes flared brighter, fury shaking her voice. “But you are nothing. You chained me. You cursed me. You would see me lose everything—”</p><p>Her voice cracked as her gaze darted to Rio, broken on the floor.</p><p>“But I will not lose her.”</p><p>The chamber shuddered. The Darkhold writhed, its pages flipping violently, ink bleeding across parchment like spilled blood.</p><p>Wanda and Lilia burst through the doors then, the storm of Agatha’s power slamming into them like a wall. They froze at the sight: Rio’s blood, Agatha blazing like a star, Evanora bracing behind her cane.</p><p>Agatha’s voice cut through, thick with tears, sharp as a blade:<br/>“Help her!” she screamed, pointing to Rio. “Help her, while I end this.”</p><p>The women fell to their knees at Rio’s side, their hands glowing, scarlet and silver, pressing desperately against her wounds.</p><p>Evanora’s shadows surged again, blacker, thicker, clawing at the air.</p><p>Agatha met them head on. The indigo glow around her erupted, searing through the chamber. Her fury carried her forward, every step cracking the floor, her voice ripping like thunder.</p><p>“She is my home, my family. You were only ever my prison!”</p><p>Evanora staggered back under the force of it, her face twisting, her grip tightening on the cane. For the first time, there was no contempt in her eyes — only a flicker of fear.</p><p>The Darkhold shrieked, its ink boiling, as mother and daughter collided in a storm of moonlight and shadow.</p><p>Agatha’s rage burned hotter than grief, hotter than the curse that had bound her all her life. It was vengeance, love, and fury fused into one — and for the first time, Evanora faltered before it.</p><p>Stone split like kindling, the windows shattering as wind howled in from the coast, rain slashing sideways through the gaps. Moonlight pierced the storm clouds above, searing into the tower and fuelling the glow that poured from Agatha’s veins.</p><p>She drove forward, indigo fire blazing from her hands, meeting Evanora’s roiling shadows head-on. Every clash was thunder, every strike a quake that rattled the foundations.</p><p>The Darkhold hovered between them, its pages shrieking, shadows writhing in agony as Agatha’s light tore at its bindings. Evanora clutched her cane, her face contorted, her eyes flashing — but behind her fury, fear crept in.</p><p>“You think love makes you strong?” Evanora hissed, spitting the word like a curse. “It makes you weak. It makes you mine.”</p><p>Agatha’s tears streamed as she hurled another blast, her voice breaking against the storm. “No. It makes me free.”</p><p>The light from her body surged brighter, eclipsing the shadow for a heartbeat.</p><p>Across the floor, Wanda and Lilia knelt in the blood, their magic glowing in tandem — scarlet wrapping tight around Rio’s torn flank, silver threading into the wound like threads of moonlight.</p><p>“Keep the pressure—” Wanda’s voice shook with strain, tears streaking her face. “She’s fading—”<br/>Lilia’s jaw clenched, sweat running down her temple as her hands trembled against Rio’s fur. “Don’t you dare leave her, wolf. Don’t you dare.”</p><p>Rio’s breath rattled, a whimper scraping her throat. Her eyes fluttered, then fixed on the chaos above — on Agatha, blazing like a star against her mother’s dark tide. Her tail twitched weakly, a broken gesture, as though reaching for her.</p><p>Wanda’s tears dripped into the blood pooling beneath her hands. She bent close, her voice fierce and breaking. “Hold on, Rio. She’s fighting for you. Fight for her.”</p><p>The floor shook violently as another clash exploded between Agatha and Evanora. The tower walls split further, stone crumbling as the storm screamed through.</p><p>Evanora snarled, her voice rising over the storm. “You are still mine, Agatha! That book binds you to me, binds everything you are!”</p><p>Agatha’s body trembled, shadows lashing her arms, burning her skin — but the glow in her chest only intensified, spilling upward, outward, until even her tears shone like falling stars.</p><p>Her voice thundered, ragged, raw with love and vengeance.<br/> “She is my family— and I will burn your darkness to keep her safe!”</p><p>And then it came — not from her hands, but from within.</p><p>The baby.</p><p>A sudden flare of indigo light burst from Agatha’s abdomen, so bright it split the storm itself. The glow pulsed in time with Rio’s heartbeat — faint, fading, fragile — and in answer, the child’s power surged. <br/>Moonlight wove itself through Agatha’s veins, amplifying her fury, her grief, her love, until the chamber itself seemed to quake beneath it.</p><p>The Darkhold writhed violently, its shadows screaming as the unborn child’s power touched it. Not Agatha’s magic. Not Evanora’s. Something purer, older — a bond of wolf and witch, born of love, forged in defiance.</p><p>Evanora staggered back, shielding her eyes. “No—”</p><p>The indigo light consumed the shadows that bound Agatha, ripping them away like torn threads. The Darkhold shuddered, its pages blackening, curling at the edges as if set aflame from within. The screech of it split the air — a book of shadows unraveling before their eyes.</p><p>Agatha gasped as her limbs freed, her body no longer chained. She stumbled, but the glow held her steady, power thrumming like a second heartbeat beneath her own.</p><p>Evanora faltered, her cane rattling against the stone, fear etched on her face.</p><p>Behind her, the Darkhold sagged, its glow weakening, its voice silenced to a hiss.</p><p>Wanda and Lilia looked up from Rio, their hands still pressed desperately to her side, their magic straining to keep her alive. The indigo glow illuminated all — Agatha, radiant and terrible, the child’s power roaring through her veins.</p><p>And Rio, her fading heartbeat answered by the baby’s defiance, her dark eyes glistening as if she too understood: they were not alone.</p><p>Evanora staggered back, her cane trembling in her grip, eyes wide as the indigo light consumed the chamber. The Darkhold writhed and screamed, its shadows peeling away into nothing, its once-immortal voice silenced under the unborn’s power.</p><p>For the first time in centuries, Evanora looked not like a conqueror, but a woman staring at something she could not command. Awe flickered in her gaze, sharp and greedy, even as fear curled at the edges.</p><p>“The child…” she breathed, her voice hushed with reverence. “Your child. Do you feel it, Agatha? Enough power to unravel even the Darkhold.” She stepped closer, her hand stretching as if to touch the glow that poured from her daughter’s body. “Together, we could wield it. You and I. Mother and daughter. With the child’s strength, nothing could stand against us. Not Salem. Not the world itself.”</p><p>Agatha stood tall, the glow coursing through her veins like fire and moonlight fused. Her skin shimmered with indigo light, her tears catching the glow as they traced down her face. </p><p>For a heartbeat she only stared at Evanora, her chest heaving, her hands trembling at her sides.</p><p>Then her voice broke the storm, steady but ragged, every word carrying the weight of a lifetime.</p><p>“All my life…” She drew a shuddering breath, her gaze never leaving her mother’s. “I thought I was broken. Wicked. Rotten at the core. Every cruel word I spoke, every sin I laid at Salem’s feet — I thought they were mine. My guilt. My shame.”</p><p>Her fingers curled into fists, the glow around her burning brighter. “But it wasn’t me, was it? It was you. You pulled the strings. You bound my will with shadows and called it truth. You made me wear your sins like a shroud.”</p><p>Evanora’s eyes narrowed, her smile taut. “I shaped you into strength, child. You would have been nothing without me—”</p><p>“No.” Agatha’s voice cut sharp as a blade, her indigo glow flaring so fiercely it cast her mother in shadow. “I am not nothing. I am not wicked. I am not yours.”</p><p>Her tears fell freely now, her chest rising with the force of her rage and her release. “I am good. I was always good. And you—” She pointed a trembling hand toward Evanora, her fury thrumming like thunder in her veins. “You will never make me doubt it again.”</p><p>The chamber shook as the words left her lips, the power of them thrumming through the stones themselves. The glow from her womb pulsed brighter, answering her defiance with a rhythm steady and true.</p><p>Evanora faltered, her face contorting as awe gave way to fury. “You think the truth will save you? That child’s power will not remain yours forever. One day, it will burn you as it burns me—”</p><p>But Agatha only shook her head, her tears catching fire in the glow. Her lips parted, her voice a vow.<br/> “No. This power is not yours to wield. It was born of love — love you could never understand. And it will be love that breaks you.”</p><p>“You will never own me again,” she cried, her voice breaking with fury, with grief, with love. “You will never touch my family again!”</p><p>She raised her hands, and the moonlight in her blood answered.</p><p>The air cracked like thunder. A column of indigo fire erupted from her body, striking Evanora square in the chest.</p><p>Evanora screamed. The sound was shrill, unearthly, clawing at the walls. Her body twisted, shadows pouring from her mouth and eyes as the Darkhold’s power tried to cling to her, tried to shield her. For a moment she stood defiant, her form half-shadow, half-flesh.</p><p>But the child’s light would not be denied.</p><p>The glow burned hotter, brighter, until the chamber itself seemed to vanish into it. Evanora’s scream pitched higher, her form unraveling, layer by layer, until there was nothing left but ash, scattering on the wind.</p><p>Her cane clattered to the floor, its silver head rolling across the stone, and the Darkhold itself let out one final wail — a sound like a thousand voices tearing at once — before it too burst apart, its pages dissolving into dust, its ink seared into oblivion.</p><p>Silence followed.</p><p>Agatha fell to her knees, the glow fading to a soft, steady pulse in her womb. Her hands clutched at her belly, tears streaming freely now, her chest heaving with sobs.</p><p>“It’s over,” she whispered, voice broken and raw. “It’s over. She’s gone.”</p><p>The chamber smelled of ash and ozone, the air still thrumming with the echo of power unleashed. Shadows no longer clung to the corners. The weight of the Darkhold, of Evanora’s leash, was gone.<br/>And for the first time in her life, Agatha Harkness was free.</p><p> Her chest heaved, her body trembling from the torrent she had unleashed, but the indigo glow at her belly pulsed steady, anchoring her.</p><p>Then—<br/>A sound split her world.</p><p>A ragged cry, low and broken. Rio.</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped toward the far end of the chamber, where Wanda and Lilia knelt in a pool of blood-streaked stone. Between them lay the wolf, her flanks heaving shallowly, her fur matted crimson. <br/>Even from across the room, Agatha saw the too-slow rise and fall of her ribs.</p><p>“No—”<br/>Agatha stumbled forward, her legs almost giving out beneath her, then surged into a desperate run. The shawl of ash clung to her as she fell to her knees beside Rio, hands shaking violently as she reached for her.</p><p>Wanda’s eyes glistened, her voice low, strained. “We’ve tried. The blow— it cut deep. She’s fading.”</p><p>Lilia’s lips were pressed tight, her hands stained, her expression grim. “We can’t hold her much longer.”</p><p>“No!” Agatha’s voice cracked like glass, a sob ripping from her throat. “No, you can’t—she can’t—” Her palms pressed hard into Rio’s bloodied fur, her words tumbling out, ragged, frantic. “She heals, she always heals. She’s strong enough. She always heals fast, she—she has to—”</p><p>Wanda caught Agatha’s arm, her own tears streaking. Her voice trembled but carried the weight of truth. “Not against this. Not against the Darkhold’s magic.”</p><p>Agatha froze, shaking her head violently, denial breaking out of her in sobs. “No, no, you’re wrong, she just needs more time, she just—” Her words splintered when Rio’s body jerked once, then sagged, the fight draining out of her.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha’s voice shattered. “Rio!” She shook her gently, then harder, her sobs rising to a scream. “No, you don’t leave me, you don’t leave us—please, gods, please!” Her entire body bent over Rio’s, her tears spilling hot and fast into her lover’s fur.</p><p>And then, as though sensing Agatha’s touch, the wolf form flickered—dimmed—and with a shudder, Rio shifted back. Her body shrank, bones reshaping, fur dissolving until at last she lay there as herself: battered, bloodied, human.</p><p>Agatha’s breath broke, a cry torn straight from her chest. She cradled Rio’s face between her palms, frantic, incoherent. </p><p>“Stay with me. Please. Please, my love, don’t leave me. Not now. Not when I’ve broken free. Not when we still—we still have everything ahead. For the baby, Rio. For our child. Please…”</p><p>Rio’s eyelids fluttered, her lips parting, but no words came — only a faint exhale, a whisper of breath against Agatha’s trembling fingers.</p><p>Agatha bent low, her forehead pressing to Rio’s, her voice a river of desperation. “You are my family. You. And this life we made together. If you go, I—” Her voice crumpled, breaking into raw sobs. “I can’t. I won’t. Not without you.”</p><p>For a heartbeat, Rio’s chest hitched beneath her palms. And then… it stilled.</p><p>The rise and fall stopped. </p><p>No breath came. </p><p>No sound.</p><p>Agatha froze, her fingers splayed desperately over Rio’s ribs, waiting — willing — for another breath. </p><p>But there was nothing.</p><p>Her wail tore through the chamber, jagged and guttural, as though her very soul had been ripped from her. </p><p>“NO!” She shook Rio’s shoulders, frantic, frantic, pressing her face into hers. “Don’t you leave me, don’t you dare leave me!”</p><p>The chamber echoed with her cries, raw and relentless. Beside her, Wanda broke — tears spilling freely, her hand covering her mouth as sobs wracked her chest. Lilia’s composure shattered too; her head bowed, her shoulders trembling as she wept openly.</p><p>The silence between their sobs was worse — heavy, suffocating. </p><p>No breath, no movement, no heartbeat. </p><p>Only grief filling every corner of the room.</p><p>And then it began.</p><p>The indigo glow stirred again, faint at first, pulsing beneath Agatha’s ribs — then stronger, brighter, spilling out into the chamber. It wrapped them both in its light, humming low, thrumming like a heartbeat amplified a thousandfold.</p><p>Wanda drew back slightly, eyes wide with awe and horror both. “It’s the child,” she whispered. “The child is answering.”</p><p>Lilia’s hand flew to her mouth, tears brimming. “Moon-born magic… it’s trying to save her.”</p><p>Agatha clutched Rio tighter, her voice breaking into prayer. “Then let it. Please, let it.”</p><p>The glow surged brighter, flooding through Agatha’s body, pouring into Rio like fire and moonlight woven together. Threads of starlight laced across her wounds, stitching them closed with something beyond mortal magic.</p><p>“Stay,” Agatha sobbed, kissing Rio’s temple, her brow, her lips. “Stay. Stay. Stay.” Her voice cracked on each word, like she was binding them into the air itself.</p><p>The chamber blazed with indigo brilliance. The shadows shrank back, the Darkhold’s remans quivered on its pedestal as the baby’s power unfurled, raw and relentless.</p><p>Agatha felt it — their child’s magic. Not yet born, not yet fully formed, but alive. Fierce. Pouring itself outward, answering the fading heartbeat of its other parent.</p><p>Rio’s chest hitched beneath Agatha’s hands. Shallow, ragged — but there. </p><p>A gasp, then another. </p><p>Her wounds glowed faintly as the light threaded them closed, slow but certain.</p><p>Agatha’s sob broke into a laugh, cracked and trembling. She pressed frantic kisses over Rio’s face. “That’s it, my love. Yes. Stay with me. With us.”</p><p>Rio’s lashes fluttered, her dark eyes opening, dazed but alive. A faint whine trembled from her throat — some last echo of the wolf — as she locked onto Agatha’s face. </p><p>Recognition flickered, fragile but real.<br/>“I’m here,” Agatha whispered, pressing her forehead to hers, her tears dripping onto Rio’s cheeks. “You won’t leave me. You won’t leave our child. We are bound — the three of us — and nothing, nothing will break it again.”</p><p>The glow dimmed at last, softening to a steady pulse in Agatha’s belly. The wounds on Rio’s body had not vanished, but they had knit enough to hold her in life’s fragile grasp.</p><p>Wanda exhaled a trembling breath, tears tracking down her cheeks. Lilia pressed her hand to her lips, whispering a prayer into the charged air.</p><p>And Agatha held Rio like she would never release her again, her voice thick with awe, grief, and fierce defiance.</p><p>“They saved you,” she whispered, hand drifting to her abdomen. “Our baby saved you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes shone with exhaustion, but a tear slid down her temple, catching the indigo glow. She leaned weakly into Agatha’s touch, her gaze heavy but steady.</p><p>“Fa…mily,” she rasped, the word broken but certain, a fragile sound that melted into the hush of the chamber.</p><p>Agatha’s heart splintered at the attempt. A sob caught in her throat as she pressed her forehead to Rio’s, her tears spilling freely. “Yes,” she whispered, her voice cracking, trembling. “Family. Always.”</p><p>And in that chamber, lit by moon-born light, witch, wolf, and child were bound — strong enough to defy even the darkest spell Salem had ever known.</p>

<p>The council chamber was heavy with silence, the torches along the walls burning low, their flames guttering as though even they feared the truth that had been brought into the room.</p><p>At the table, the councillors sat stiff, wary. Their gazes fixed on Wanda Maximoff, who stood before them with ash-streaked hands. Upon the stone table, she laid what remained of the Darkhold — blackened fragments of parchment, scraps of binding, ink charred into nothingness.</p><p>Her voice cut through the stillness, low but steady. “This is what Evanora wielded. Not her own will. Not Salem’s law. This book. This corruption.”</p><p>Her gaze swept them one by one, her words sharp enough to draw blood. “Agatha was not your enemy. Rio was not your beast. Evanora chained them both. She chained Salem itself.”</p><p>Uneasy murmurs rippled, but suspicion lingered on their faces. Mora leaned forward, lips pressed thin, eyes flashing. “Convenient, isn’t it? That the one who benefits from Evanora’s absence now spins tales to excuse a monster’s rampage.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes burned as she took a step closer, her hand flattening against the ash. “You think I would bring this here lightly? You think I wanted to touch it, to carry it in my hands? This is not fable. This is proof.”</p><p>Before Mora could retort, the doors to the chamber groaned open.</p><p>Gasps rose as three councillors staggered in, their cloaks disheveled, their faces pale with exhaustion. <br/>Their eyes — clear now, but haunted — swept the room before fixing on the ash that lay before Wanda.</p><p>“We were hers,” one said, his voice raw. “Bound by words that were not ours.”</p><p>Another’s hands shook as she clutched the edge of the table. “These last weeks… we answered only to Evanora. Thought only her thoughts. Spoke only her words. And now—” Her voice broke, a sob escaping. “Now I see what she made me.”</p><p>The chamber stilled.</p><p>One by one, the councillors gave their testimonies, voices cracking with grief and fury. They spoke of the whispers that had filled their minds, of hands moved like puppets, of choices twisted until they belonged to Evanora alone.</p><p>And each time, their gaze returned to Wanda. To the ash. To the truth laid bare.</p><p>“She bound us all,” the last whispered. “But she is gone. And the spell with her.”</p><p>Mora’s jaw tightened, her face paling as the weight of their words filled the chamber. For once, she had no retort, no accusation to level. The truth did not leave room for it.</p><p>Wanda stood tall, her voice carrying over the stunned silence. “You heard it from their mouths. Evanora bent even your own to her will. Agatha fought to break free. And Rio — the wolf you fear — fought beside her. Without them both, this chamber would still be hers.”</p><p>The torches hissed, throwing sharp light across the councillors’ faces.</p><p>Wanda’s voice rose one last time, cutting through the tension like a blade. “Do not mistake fear for truth. Salem’s enemy is not Rio. It never was. It was Evanora. And she is dust.”</p><p>Her words hung in the charged air, impossible to deny.</p><p>The freed councillors stood pale and shaking, their confessions lingering in the air like an indictment of them all. Yet still, the divide cut sharp across the table.</p><p>One councillor, her voice trembling but firm, leaned forward. “The Red Witch speaks truth. Evanora bound us. We felt her chains. Without Agatha, without the wolf, we would not be standing here free.”<br/>A murmur of agreement rippled among a few others. Faces softened, shadows of guilt flickering in their eyes.</p><p>But Mora’s lips curled into a thin, cold line. “Chains or no chains,” she said, her tone slicing through the room, “the beast spilled Salem blood. Wardens lie dead. Their families grieve. Will you tell them to thank the wolf for their loss?”</p><p>A hiss of uneasy voices answered her, some nodding, others turning away. The chamber was caught between fear and truth, shame and stubbornness.</p><p>Wanda’s hands clenched at her sides, her voice taut with fury. “You blind yourselves. You would rather chain the innocent than face your own failure. Evanora fooled you because you let her — because fear is easier than wisdom.”</p><p>“Enough!” Mora snapped, rising to her feet. Her cloak rippled as she pointed a sharp hand toward the ash. <br/>“That book is gone, yes. Evanora is gone, yes. But the wolf remains. And every breath she takes is a reminder of Salem’s weakness.”</p><p>“No,” one of the freed councillors countered, his voice shaking but strong. “She is not weakness. She is proof that love can resist even the darkest chains. That is what freed us. Not your fear.”</p><p>The chamber roared then, voices colliding — some echoing Mora’s call for blood, others lifting in shaky defence of the wolf.</p><p>The torches guttered with the heat of it, smoke rising thick, the air charged with Salem’s fracture.<br/>And Wanda stood in the centre of it all, her hands still stained with ash, her heart still burning with Agatha’s vow and Rio’s near fall.</p><p>She did not bow her head. She did not retreat.</p><p>She waited until the noise peaked, then raised her hand. A flicker of crimson sparked across her palm, sharp enough to command silence.</p><p>When the voices faltered, her words cut through the smoke and clamour like a blade.</p><p>“You speak of blood, of grief, of chains broken and lives lost. But you have not yet faced the truth that sits before you.”</p><p>Her gaze swept the chamber, steady and unyielding. “Agatha Harkness carries a child. A child of shadow and moon. Witch and wolf.”</p><p>A hush fell, sharp as a gasp. Even Mora froze, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>Whispers rippled instantly through the councillors.</p><p>“A child?” “Moon-born?” “Impossible—”</p><p>Wanda silenced them with a glare, her voice deepening, every word deliberate.</p><p>“Yes. The prophecy you have twisted for generations speaks of what is to come. But hear me well: this child is not a threat. Not a weapon. Not another chain for you to wield.”</p><p>Her throat tightened, but her conviction only sharpened. “This child saved Rio’s life when the Darkhold’s poison would have claimed her. It saved Agatha from her mother’s leash. This power you fear is not destruction — it is love. And I will not see you lay a hand on them.”</p><p>Gasps broke out again, some in awe, others in horror.</p><p>Mora’s face hardened, her voice laced with disdain. “You expect us to believe that a creature born of wolf and witch will save Salem? That it will not curse us all?”</p><p>Wanda stepped forward, the firelight casting her in stark relief. Her crimson magic flared faintly at her fingertips, but her eyes were brighter still.</p><p>“I do not expect. I know. I have seen enough of grief to know what survives it. And what survives — what perseveres — is love. That is what lives in Agatha’s womb. That is what you will damn yourselves to destroy if you let fear guide you again.”</p><p>She drew a breath, her voice dropping, but the steel in it was unmistakable.</p><p>“I swear this before every name written in your books and every stone in these walls: I will not let you harm Agatha, Rio, or their child. If you try — you will answer to me.”</p><p>The silence that followed was suffocating. Councillors glanced at one another, some shaken, some ashamed, some still gripped by fear.</p><p>But the truth had been spoken. It hung in the air heavier than any decree.</p><p>And for the first time, Salem was forced to reckon with it.</p><p><br/>————</p><p>The cottage was dim, its air thick with the scent of healing herbs and smoke. </p><p>Rio lay stretched across the bed, her skin pale against the dark wool blanket. The wounds that once tore deep into her side were now bound in fresh bandages, the indigo glow that had stitched her flesh together faded to nothing. Her breaths came steady, but shallow, her chest rising and falling with fragile rhythm.</p><p>Lilia hovered near, her hands stained from salves and tinctures, fussing over every strip of cloth, every poultice. Her lips moved in mutters, half prayers, half curses aimed at the council, the Darkhold, at fate itself.</p><p>Beside Rio, Agatha sat stiff-backed, her nightdress clinging damp to her skin, her hands locked around Rio’s arm. Her knuckles were white, trembling with the effort of holding on. She had not moved since they laid Rio down, not even to change her own bandages or let Lilia tend to the bruises darkening her skin.</p><p>Her eyes — red-rimmed, hollow — never left Rio’s face.</p><p>She had seen it. The stillness. The silence. The limp body slipping from her grasp. </p><p>She had felt the world collapse in her chest when breath had ceased. That moment had carved itself into her bones, into her blood. And though the child’s light had brought Rio back, the memory of her lifeless weight lingered like a curse.</p><p>Her hand shook as she reached, brushing the hair from Rio’s damp brow. She pressed her lips there, a broken whisper spilling out before she could stop it.</p><p>“I thought I lost you.”</p><p>Her voice cracked, soft and raw. Tears welled again, spilling unchecked down her cheeks. She curled herself closer, her head resting against Rio’s shoulder, her hand pressed firmly to her abdomen as though holding onto both lives at once.</p><p>“I can’t lose you. Not you. Not ever.”</p><p>Lilia paused in her work, her gaze softening as it fell on them. She moved quietly, adjusting the poultice one last time before retreating to the hearth, giving them the space of silence.</p><p>Rio stirred faintly, her lashes fluttering. A sound caught in her throat, low and rough, her lips parting as if to form words. Nothing came — only a whine, weak but familiar.</p><p>Agatha jerked up, her tears spilling faster at the sound. She cradled Rio’s face between her trembling hands, kissing her temple, her brow, her lips.<br/>“Shh, my love. Don’t speak. You’re safe. You’re safe.”</p><p>Her voice was fierce even through the cracks, as though saying it might make it true. She pulled Rio’s arm tighter against her chest, her own heart pounding wildly beneath it.</p><p>Lilia turned away, her shoulders stiff. She had seen grief enough in her years, but never a love so raw it seemed to bleed through the air itself.</p><p>In the hush of the cottage, with only the crackle of embers for witness, Agatha pressed herself close to Rio, refusing to let her slip away again.</p><p>For the first time in years, she was afraid to sleep.</p><p>Because if she closed her eyes, she feared she might wake to find Rio gone.</p><p>The hours dragged heavy. The fire burned to embers, the room steeped in half-dark, shadows stretching long across the beams.</p><p>Agatha had not moved. Her back ached, her hands were numb from clutching Rio’s arm, but still she did not let go. Her head rested on Rio’s shoulder, her tears long dried to salt on her skin. Every shallow breath from the woman she loved was counted, memorised, guarded like treasure.</p><p>She didn’t hear Lilia slip quietly back home to rest. Didn’t notice the hush fall deeper in the cottage.</p><p>All she knew was Rio.</p><p>Then, faint — the twitch of fingers. Agatha’s head snapped up, her breath catching as Rio’s hand shifted against hers.</p><p>Her dark eyes flickered open, glassy, heavy, but alive.</p><p>Agatha choked on a sob, her hands cupping Rio’s face. “You’re here. Gods, you’re still here.”</p><p>Rio’s lips parted, dry and cracked, a breath rasping out. The sound caught, broke, but then—<br/>“Ag…tha.”</p><p>Agatha shattered. A sob ripped from her chest as she pressed her lips to Rio’s, gentle and desperate all at once. “Yes. Yes, my love, I’m here. Always.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed faintly, her voice raw and weak, but she pushed another word through, trembling against Agatha’s ear.</p><p>“Stay.”</p><p>Agatha’s tears poured freely now, her forehead pressed to hers, her body trembling with the force of it. “Nothing could take me from you. Not shadows, not curses, not death itself. I will stay. Always. Always.”</p><p>Her hand drifted instinctively to her abdomen, where the faintest warmth pulsed steady as a heartbeat. She pressed Rio’s hand there too, covering it with her own.</p><p>“Our child saved you,” Agatha whispered, her voice breaking. “They knew I couldn’t live without you. They knew.”</p><p>Rio’s lashes fluttered, her lips curving just slightly, the ghost of a smile. Her hand pressed weakly beneath Agatha’s, as if to promise she felt it too.</p><p>Agatha broke again, a wet laugh tangled with her sobs. She kissed her, soft and lingering, a vow sealed in the dark.</p><p>And for the first time since the chamber, she let her mind calm:<br/>They were still together.<br/>Witch, wolf, and child.<br/>Bound. Alive.<br/>Unbroken.</p><p>———</p><p>Weeks had passed since the battle at Evanora’s mansion, since Wanda’s threat to the council. The bruises had faded, the wounds knit, and the weight of ash and shadow had slowly loosened its grip on Salem. Still, the memory of that night lingered like smoke in the bones of those who lived it.</p><p>But now the season had turned. The air carried the bite of autumn, the leaves fell in fiery cascades, and Samhain had come — the night when the veil thinned, when the living set places for the dead and laughter carried across the dark to keep the spirits gentle.</p><p>The cottage garden glowed with firelight, the air sharp with autumn chill and the sweet tang of apples baking on the hearth.</p><p>Lilia had dragged out a table and dressed it in dried leaves and gourds, bowls of roasted nuts and honeyed bread set out as offerings. A little plate sat at the end, untouched, for those who had gone before.</p><p>Cora danced around it all with a crown of straw on her curls, her voice piping as she sang some half-remembered rhyme. Althea clapped along, cheeks flushed from cider, her laugh echoing bright against the night.</p><p>Agatha sat in a cushioned chair pulled near the fire, her shawl wrapped loosely about her shoulders. For the first time, her belly pressed gently against the fabric — the swell unmistakable now, rounded beneath her hand. She shifted, uncertain at being the focus of so many fond glances, but Rio was planted firmly at her side, crouched at her feet like a sentinel. The wolf in her bristled at every stray ember, every sudden laugh — but she didn’t move far. Her hand never strayed from Agatha’s knee.</p><p>“Gods above,” Lilia said dryly, sipping her mulled wine. “If Rio hovers any closer, we’ll have to sit her in your lap, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha flushed scarlet while Wanda snorted into her cup. Rio only blinked at them, head tilted, as if entirely unbothered by the teasing.</p><p>“She takes guarding seriously,” Agatha muttered, smoothing her hand over her belly, though a reluctant smile tugged at her lips.</p><p>“Serious,” Cora mimicked, skipping over to press a sticky apple into Rio’s hand. “But silly too.”</p><p>Rio accepted it with a look of faint awe, as though holding a treasure, and Cora giggled until Wanda swept her up, tossing her high enough to draw squeals.</p><p>“Careful,” Althea warned, though she was smiling too, her hand clasped over her heart.</p><p>Lilia leaned forward, her eyes bright in the firelight. “Tonight’s the night for looking forward as much as back. I say we take our turn at divination. Shall we see what the child makes of the thinning veil?”</p><p>Agatha stiffened, her hand clutching instinctively at her belly. But Wanda gave her a look, gentle and steady. “Only if you wish it.”</p><p>The fire cracked, sparks dancing upward as if in answer.</p><p>Agatha hesitated — then nodded. “Yes. Let us see.”</p><p>Rio’s hand slid up to cover hers, warm and grounding.</p><p>Lilia fetched a bowl of water, setting it in the firelight. The flames shimmered across the surface, bending and breaking into shapes. She murmured words under her breath, her voice half-song, half-prayer.</p><p>And then the water rippled. A glow stirred beneath the surface — soft, indigo, thrumming like a heartbeat.</p><p>Agatha gasped, her hand flying to her belly. Rio leaned closer, nostrils flaring as if scenting something in the air, a low sound humming in her chest.</p><p>Lilia’s voice softened. “Strong. Moon-born. And not just power, but joy. This child carries light, Agatha. Enough to scatter shadows.”</p><p>For a moment, the heaviness of the past weeks lifted. Wanda smiled, Cora clapped her hands, Althea kissed her daughter’s hair, and Lilia’s gaze softened as the glow danced across their faces.</p><p>Agatha pressed her palm firmly against her belly, tears stinging her eyes. Rio looked up at her, dark eyes glistening, and for the first time since the tower, laughter rose in Agatha’s throat.</p><p>Not bitter. Not broken. But light.</p><p>Wanda leaned back in her chair, sipping the last of the cider, when Lilia straightened suddenly, eyes bright.</p><p>“Oh, quick! It’s time,” she announced.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Time for what?”</p><p>“The hand-fasting,” Lilia said with a smile, already gathering her cloak. <br/>“Two of the village witches have chosen to wed tonight, under Samhain’s blessing. The square will be lit for it.”</p><p>Althea brightened, adjusting Cora’s shawl around her small shoulders. “It’s all the child’s been talking about. Haven’t you, dove?”</p><p>Cora nodded vigorously, eyes wide and eager. “We can’t miss it! The ribbons, and the dancing, and the kiss at the end!”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, brow furrowed. “Hand…fasting?” she echoed, the word low, uncertain on her tongue.</p><p>Cora, delighted to be the one with knowledge, skipped to her side as they all began bundling into cloaks.</p><p>“It’s when two people tie their hands together with ribbon,” she explained, making big looping gestures with her arms. “It means they promise to stay tied to each other forever. And everyone cheers.”</p><p>Rio frowned slightly, trying to picture it. “Tied?”</p><p>“Not tied-tied,” Cora giggled. “It’s a promise. A love promise.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, a faint smile tugging at her lips. “Trust Salem to dress vows in silk and ceremony.”<br/> <br/>Her voice was light, teasing, but it carried a warmth that softened her features. She tugged her cloak tighter against the chill, but Rio’s arm curled firmer around her waist, steadying her, guiding her gently toward the gate as though she were something precious that might slip away.</p><p>The walk through the crooked streets was brisk, their breath clouding pale in the night air. Lanterns bobbed in the dark, each glow catching on damp stones and crooked beams, painting the town in shifting light. </p><p>The villagers gathered in slow trickles, cloaks heavy with the scent of smoke, earth, and the faint tang of cider. Ahead, the square glowed: banners strung high, fire pits burning low and bright, casting molten gold across the cobblestones. The air thrummed with expectation, with celebration.</p><p>Rio kept to Agatha’s side as though tethered by instinct. One hand rested protectively at her back, steady and grounding, while the other brushed her arm whenever the press of the crowd drew too near. Her stance was watchful, shoulders squared, her dark eyes flicking constantly between the shifting villagers and the woman at her side — guarding her, always.</p><p>Agatha leaned into her touch without hesitation, her hand absently covering Rio’s gloved one at her waist, as though to reassure her that she was safe. That she was not alone.</p><p>The firelight kissed her profile, gilding the proud line of her cheek. Her shawl slipped slightly, revealing the curve of her collarbone, one hand coming to rest over the gentle swell of her belly. She looked serene, radiant — proud, alive in a way that made Rio’s throat ache.</p><p>“Stop staring,” Agatha murmured, not turning her head. Her lips curved, sly.</p><p>Rio stiffened slightly, her eyes darting away. “Not—” Her voice caught, awkward. “Not staring.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile widened. She finally turned to look at her, eyes gleaming with mischief in the firelight. “You’re dreadful at lying, darling.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened as if she meant to argue, but she said nothing. She only held Agatha closer, her gaze sliding back helplessly to her face, her hand tghtening at her waist.</p><p>Agatha softened, brushing her thumb lightly over Rio’s gloved fingers. “You’re allowed to look, you know,” she said quietly, the teasing stripped away now. “I rather like it.”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, her breath hitching. She wanted to say <em>always</em>, wanted to say <em>I can’t stop.</em> But the words lodged heavy in her throat, trembling there, unsaid.</p><p>The crowd hushed then, a ripple of reverence falling over the square as two witches stepped forward. <br/>Their hands were joined, their wrists bound with scarlet ribbon, the knot tied by steady fingers while vows were spoken aloud.</p><p>Rio’s head tilted, her brow furrowed. At first, it was strange to her — the ribbons, the chant, the way the villagers leaned in as though something sacred was happening before them. But slowly, as the vows filled the air, she felt it: the weight of the moment, the way the firelight seemed to hold its breath, the way every heart in the square beat in time.</p><p>She watched the knot being tied, the cloth binding two people together, and something clicked in her chest. <br/>This was how they showed love. <br/>This was how they promised never to part.</p><p>Her throat tightened. <em>I want this</em>, she thought fiercely, the realisation burning hot and unshakable. <em>With her. Only her</em>.</p><p>Her gaze lingered on Agatha — the proud tilt of her chin, the soft curve of her hand over her belly, the faint smile on her lips as the crowd cheered. Rio stared, her heart pounding, reverent and hungry all at once.</p><p>Not as the vows were spoken. Not as the knot was tied. Not as the cheers rose, echoing against the night sky.</p><p>Her arm curled tighter around Agatha’s waist, protective, certain. Her mind rang with clarity: if this is what love looked like, if this is how people bound themselves together, then she would do it. She would vow herself in silk and firelight, in ribbons and words, if it meant she could call Agatha hers forever.</p><p>The thought seared through her, bright as the moon overhead, steady as breath in her lungs:<br/><em>Her. Always her.</em></p><p><br/>The cheers still lingered, fading into laughter and music as the villagers began to peel away from the square. Lanterns swayed overhead, their light catching on the fluttering ribbons where the vows had been bound.</p><p>Rio hadn’t moved. Her arm was still tight around Agatha’s waist, her body angled between her and the thinning crowd. Her eyes were fixed on the knot, her expression taut with thought. </p><p>The wolf in her understood blood, pack, survival — but this, this tying of ribbons and vows, it was something else. <br/>Something she could feel thrumming in her chest.</p><p>Agatha noticed the way her gaze lingered. She tilted her head, lips curving faintly. “You look as though you’ve seen a ghost,” she teased softly, though her voice held more tenderness than jest.</p><p>Rio’s throat worked. Her lips parted, sound catching in her chest. A low whine slipped free, soft but urgent. She turned her face toward Agatha, eyes glistening, her jaw tense with words she could not quite shape.</p><p>Her hand twitched, half-lifted, reaching toward the square where the vows had just been bound. “You…” she rasped, then faltered. Her voice strained, broken but certain. “You… me…”</p><p>But before the thought could form, before Rio could finish, a warm voice cut across the moment.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>They both turned. A woman from the village — one of the seamstresses who had always kept her distance before — was standing a few paces away, a small basket hooked on her arm. Her face was cautious, but kind.</p><p>“I—” she hesitated, then offered a faint smile. “I only wished to ask how you’ve been feeling. Since your return.” Her eyes flicked, just once, to the curve beneath Agatha’s shawl, then quickly back up. “It’s good to see you out among us again.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, startled, then softened, smoothing her hand absently over her belly. “I’m well,” she said, her voice gentler than usual. “Better than I thought I might be.”</p><p>The woman nodded, relief flickering across her face. “Good. That’s good.” She offered Agatha a respectful dip of her head before slipping back into the dispersing crowd.</p><p>Rio’s eyes had followed the exchange with open confusion, her chest rising and falling a little faster. People had feared them for so long — yet now they smiled? They asked after Agatha’s health as though she belonged here, as though she was one of them.</p><p>She looked back to Agatha, the words still burning in her throat, sharper now. What she had seen in that ceremony was no small thing. If this was how people showed love, she wanted it too — wanted it fiercely.</p><p>Her hand moved down to grasp at Agatha’s, her eyes searching her face with aching reverence.</p><p>Agatha glanced up at her, brow arched, a knowing little curve tugging at her lips. “Later,” she murmured, just for her. “Whatever it is you’re trying to say. Tell me when it’s only us.”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, her jaw tight, but she nodded once, the vow unspoken but blazing bright in her chest.</p><p>And as the last cheers faded into the night, she knew — the ribbons, the vows, the promise of forever — she would have it with Agatha. Somehow, some way.</p><p>The cheers in the square finally dwindled, the fire pits burning low to ash. The night air was crisp, touched with the faint bite of approaching winter. Salem’s people began to scatter back to their cottages, lanterns bobbing into the crooked streets.</p><p>Wanda lingered near the edge of the crowd, her arms crossed loosely, her gaze softer than usual. When the last of the vows were sealed, she reached up quickly, dabbing at the corner of her eye with a sleeve.</p><p>Lilia arched a brow. “You’re crying?”</p><p>Wanda sniffed once, then shook her head, a wry smile tugging at her lips. “Too much cider. Makes me sentimental.”</p><p>Lilia huffed, not quite convinced, but let it pass.</p><p>Althea gathered Cora’s cloak tighter, murmuring that it was time for bed. But before they could leave, the little girl broke free, her curls bouncing as she ran toward Rio.</p><p>“Goodnight!” she squealed, launching herself into Rio’s arms.</p><p>Rio caught her easily, the corners of her mouth twitching upward as Cora pressed a sloppy kiss to her cheek. “Safe!” Cora declared fiercely, patting Rio’s face with small hands. “You stay safe.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened, watching the wolf cradle the child as though she were spun from glass. She smoothed a hand over Cora’s curls before gently coaxing her back to Althea’s arms.</p><p>“Sleep well, darling,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Cora clung for another moment, then finally let go, her goodnight echoing in the square as Althea carried her off.</p><p>Althea paused, adjusting Cora against her shoulder. Her eyes lingered on Agatha and Rio, her expression softening into something quietly certain. “You’ll make wonderful parents,” she said simply, her voice low but sure.</p><p>Agatha blinked, her hand instinctively brushing her belly. Rio’s arm tightened almost protectively around her waist, her dark eyes flicking to Althea’s in something like surprise, then gratitude.</p><p>Lilia gave Agatha and Rio one last look — sharp, assessing, then softer, almost protective — before she carried her daughter home.</p><p>Wanda stretched her arms, yawning deliberately. “And I am off before this cider makes me weep again. Goodnight, Agatha. Rio.” Her eyes lingered on them a moment longer, unreadable, before she swept away into the mist.</p><p>Silence fell around them as the square emptied. The banners fluttered faintly overhead, the embers of the fire crackling low.</p><p>Rio shifted, her arm finding its place once more around Agatha’s waist. Agatha leaned into her without hesitation, her hand slipping over Rio’s gloved one. Together they began the walk home, their steps slow, their path lit only by the moon.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head just enough to glance up at her. “You carried yourself well tonight,” she said softly, her voice laced with affection.</p><p>Rio’s gaze flicked to her, dark eyes glimmering, but she didn’t answer — not with words. Her arm tightened instead, holding Agatha a little closer, as if the vows spoken tonight had been written only for them.</p><p>And under the glow of Samhain’s moon, Agatha let herself smile, her free hand drifting over the curve of her belly, imagining all that was yet to come.</p><p>The cottage door creaked as Rio pushed it open, the warmth of the hearth spilling faintly into the cool night. The walk home had been quiet, their breaths pluming in the cold air, the hush between them filled only with the weight of the evening.</p><p>Inside, the fire had burned low, casting the room in soft amber shadows. Agatha tugged her cloak free, the fabric heavy and damp at the edges with mist. She moved to hang it, but Rio was already there, taking it gently from her hands.</p><p>“You’ll crease it,” Agatha teased faintly, her voice low, tired but playful.</p><p>Rio’s lips curved — not quite a smile, more a breath caught between devotion and awe — as she laid the cloak carefully aside. When she turned back, her gaze lingered on Agatha longer than she meant it to. The firelight painted her in copper and gold, her dark hair tumbling loose around her shoulders, her eyes still carrying the weight of the night’s ceremony.</p><p>Her hands hovered before they dared to move, brushing over the shawl at Agatha’s shoulders. She undid the knot slowly, deliberately, as though every slip of fabric revealed something precious. Her fingers brushed against her collarbone, feather-light, tracing a line of warmth across pale skin.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, but she said nothing, only tilted her head, watching her with a knowing smile tugging faintly at her lips.</p><p>“You fuss worse than Lilia,” she whispered, her voice like velvet, like a secret.</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened but did not waver, drinking her in. She slid the shawl from her shoulders with care, fingertips grazing bare arms as though she were memorising the feel of her. The pads of her fingers lingered at her elbow, then her wrist, slow and reluctant to leave even the smallest touch behind.</p><p>The purple dress slipped lower at the shoulders, the fabric falling in a soft cascade. Rio’s breath caught when the gentle swell of Agatha’s belly was revealed, her hand hovering before it finally spread across her skin. Her palm was warm and steady, thumb sweeping in a slow arc as though reassuring herself that both mother and child were there, alive, safe.</p><p>Agatha’s lashes fluttered at the contact, her body trembling with the quiet intimacy of the gesture. Her own hands rose, threading into Rio’s hair, her fingers curling at the nape of her neck. She held her there, grounding herself in the solidity of her presence.</p><p>“You look at me,” she murmured, her voice unsteady but tender, “as though I were some sacred thing.”</p><p>Rio’s answer came wordlessly. She dipped her head, pressing her lips softly against the curve of Agatha’s stomach, lingering there long enough that her breath warmed her skin.</p><p>It was a kiss and a vow all at once. </p><p>When she rose, her gaze locked onto Agatha’s, dark and burning with unspoken devotion.</p><p>Agatha’s heart clenched, her throat tight. She cupped Rio’s face between trembling palms, pulling her close until their foreheads pressed together, eyes closing at the sheer relief of it. </p><p>The brush of Rio’s nose against hers, the warmth of her breath mingling with her own — it was enough to undo her.</p><p>“I am yours,” she whispered, voice breaking under the weight of it. “Always yours.”</p><p>Rio’s lips met hers then — deep, trembling, almost hesitant — but threaded through with a devotion so fierce it silenced the room around them. Agatha answered it at once, her mouth parting, her hands sliding from Rio’s face to grip her shoulders, pulling her nearer, needing her closer. The kiss deepened, lingered, their breaths tangling, sighs spilling between them like confessions.</p><p>When at last they parted, their lips barely inches apart, Agatha’s breath shuddered out, her body trembling with the intimacy of it. She rested her forehead to Rio’s, her hand drifting to the steady heartbeat beneath her chest.<br/>“Come to bed,” she murmured, her voice rough but tender. “Stay with me.”</p><p>Rio nodded once, eyes glistening. Her thumb swept a gentle arc across Agatha’s cheek, as though she could not bring herself to cease touching her. She guided Agatha to the bed with unhurried steps, helping her shed the last of her clothing, her hands lingering at the curve of her waist, the slope of her shoulder, the line of her arm — each touch devout, as though rediscovering the topography of her body.</p><p>They lay facing each other on the cool sheets, the fading light outside painting their skin in shades of gold and amber. Agatha’s fingers traced idle patterns on Rio’s arm, her touch light and curious.</p><p>“You’re trembling,” Agatha noted softly, her thumb brushing the sharp cut of Rio’s cheekbone.</p><p>Rio made a soft sound, neither confirmation nor denial, her golden eyes never leaving Agatha’s face. Her hand moved almost unconsciously to Agatha’s abdomen, fingers splaying wide as though to encompass all of her, to keep her close.</p><p>“I’m here,” Agatha whispered, pressing closer until their foreheads touched. “I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>The words seemed to steady Rio. She nodded once, sharply, before capturing Agatha’s lips in another kiss — softer this time, but no less deep. Agatha melted into it, her arms winding around Rio’s neck, pulling her closer.</p><p>They moved together slowly, bodies fitting like puzzle pieces. Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio’s hand slid lower, calloused fingers brushing the inside of her thigh. The touch was feather-light, questioning, and when Agatha opened her legs just a fraction, Rio let out a shuddering breath.</p><p>“Safe?” she murmured against Agatha’s lips, her voice rough with unshed emotion.</p><p>Agatha answered by guiding Rio’s hand higher, a soft whimper escaping her when those talented fingers found their target. Rio’s touch was careful at first, almost worshipful, as though afraid she might break something so precious.</p><p>Agatha arched into the touch, her fingers tangling in Rio’s hair. “Don’t hold back,” she urged, her voice breathless. “You won’t hurt us, my love.”</p><p>Something in Rio seemed to snap at those words. Her touch grew bolder, more sure, fingers parting Agatha’s folds with a gentle reverence that made her entire body shudder. When Rio’s thumb found her clit, Agatha gasped, hips jerking upward.</p><p>“Good,” Rio observed, her tone almost wonder-filled. She repeated the motion, this time with a firmer touch, and was rewarded with another full-bodied shiver from Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s breath came in short pants now, her nails digging into Rio’s shoulder. “Yes,” she gasped. “Just like that. Oh, gods, Rio —”</p><p>Rio’s answering growl was low and primal. She shifted suddenly, pushing Agatha onto her back and sliding down her body. Before Agatha could process the movement, Rio’s mouth was on her, tongue laving a broad stripe that made her see stars.</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha cried out, one hand fisting in Rio’s hair while the other gripped the sheets. “Oh, that’s — please, don’t stop.”</p><p>Rio hummed against her, the vibration sending fresh waves of pleasure through Agatha. Her tongue circled Agatha’s clit with maddening precision, each pass making her hips jerk upward.</p><p>“Mine,” Rio murmured between licks, her words muffled but fervent.  “My Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s climax hit her like a thunderbolt, ripping a cry from her throat. Rio rode it out with her, tongue gentling to soft laps as Agatha trembled through the aftershocks.</p><p>When she could finally breathe again, Agatha opened her eyes, to find Rio rutting against her thigh, hips jerking in short, sharp movements. Her cock was hard and heavy, the head a deep, flushed red, and Agatha felt a surge of desire twist low in her belly.</p><p>"Rio," she whispered, reaching down to still her movements. "Look at me."</p><p>Rio lifted her gaze, golden eyes dark and desperate. Agatha held it as she manoeuvred them, turning until they lay facing each other once more.</p><p>"Come here, my love," Agatha demanded, voice husky with renewed need. Her hand found Rio's cock, guiding it to her entrance. "I need you inside me. Now."</p><p>Rio's breath caught, a shudder rippling through her broad frame. She nodded once, sharp and jerky, before shifting forward. The blunt head of her cock pressed against Agatha, sliding through her wetness before pushing inside with a slow, steady pressure.</p><p>Agatha gasped, her back arching off the bed. Rio filled her completely, stretching her in the most delicious way. Her inner muscles clenched around the intrusion, drawing a guttural groan from Rio.</p><p>"Agatha," Rio breathed, her voice trembling. "So good. So —"</p><p>She broke off as Agatha hooked a leg around her waist, urging her deeper. The movement elicited a strangled cry from them both.</p><p>Rio began to move then, slow and tentative at first, as though afraid of hurting her or the baby. Agatha met each thrust with a roll of her hips, urging her on.</p><p>"Harder," she gasped, nails digging into Rio's shoulder. "Don't hold back. I can take it."</p><p>Something in Rio's expression shifted at that, a flash of primal hunger darkening her eyes. She gripped Agatha's thigh, spreading her legs wider as she snapped her hips forward with more force.</p><p>The change in angle had Rio's cock dragging against a soft spot deep inside Agatha that made stars burst behind her eyelids. She cried out, head thrown back, fingers clutching at Rio's hair.</p><p>"Yes!" Agatha managed through clenched teeth. "Oh gods, yes, just like that. Don't stop, Rio, please don't stop."</p><p>Rio's response was a low, rumbling growl. She set a punishing pace, each thrust powerful and deep, her cock hitting that same perfect spot with every movement. Agatha felt another climax building, tightening in her core like a spring winding to its breaking point.</p><p>"Close," she gasped out, meeting Rio's frenzied pace with abandon. "So close, Rio. With me, please, I need —"</p><p>Rio's hand slipped between them then, thumb finding Agatha's clit with unerring precision. The dual sensation of her cock filling Agatha and her fingers working her clit was too much.</p><p>Agatha came undone with a scream, her inner walls clenching around Rio's cock as pleasure washed over her in overwhelming waves. Through the haze of her own climax, she felt Rio stiffen, her thrusts becoming erratic before she buried herself deep inside Agatha with a guttural cry.</p><p>They rode out their climaxes together, bodies trembling, sweat-slicked skin sliding against each other. When the last shudders subsided, Rio collapsed beside Agatha, her weight heavy and comforting.</p><p>Agatha turned to her side, pressing a soft kiss to Rio's shoulder. Neither spoke, content to bask in the afterglow of what they had shared. But as their breathing slowed and their heart rates returned to normal, Agatha couldn't shake the feeling that this — all of this — was only the beginning.</p><p>They had found each other in the depths of madness and had emerged stronger, changed. But the world beyond Agatha's cottage was still broken, still in need of mending. And they were no longer the same women who had stumbled into the unknown all those months ago.</p><p>Agatha's hand drifted to her stomach, to the new life growing within. She felt a fierce determination well up inside her, a resolve that had only grown stronger since she had first felt that tiny, insistent heartbeat beneath her palm.</p><p>They would face what came next together, as they had faced everything else. They would build a new world, one where their child could grow in safety and love. And they would do it as equals, as partners, as witches bound by more than just magic.</p><p>For now, though, Agatha allowed herself to simply be, to enjoy the warmth of Rio's body beside hers, the steady rhythm of her breath. They had all the time in the world to plan for the future.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>The afternoon light slanted low through Wanda’s cottage, warm but dim, catching the dust motes in the air. Rio stood by the hearth, restless, shifting her weight from one foot to the other. Her arms hung stiff at her sides, then crossed, then fell again, unable to settle. She had come here with a purpose, but now that she was inside, her throat felt tight, words clawing upward and refusing to come. Her jaw clenched, unclenched, her gaze fixed anywhere but Wanda.</p><p>Wanda, of course, noticed. She always did. She looked up from the small bundle of herbs she was sorting and gave a faint, knowing smile. Her eyes lingered on Rio’s tense stance, the way her shoulders curved inward as though to hide her own heart. “You didn’t come here for sage, did you?”</p><p>Rio’s dark eyes flicked toward her, quick and sharp, then dropped away almost instantly, as though the truth had been caught before she could tuck it back. Heat bloomed across her cheekbones. She shook her head once, abrupt, embarrassed, her lips pressing into a thin line.</p><p>Wanda set the herbs aside, dusting her palms together slowly, deliberately, as if to give Rio a moment. Then she leaned back in her chair, arms folding across her chest, her expression open but pointed. “Then what is it?”</p><p>Rio’s fists curled against her thighs. Her jaw worked, her throat bobbed with the effort of words too large to fit past her teeth. Silence stretched taut between them. Finally, halting, broken, she forced them out. <br/>“The… tying.”</p><p>Wanda’s brows lifted faintly, her head tilting, her dark hair spilling across one shoulder. “At the hand-fasting?”</p><p>Rio nodded, quick, tight, her breath hitching. “I… want.” She gestured vaguely, frustrated with her own clumsy tongue, then pressed her hand flat to her chest, her palm thudding against her heart. Her gaze flicked up, raw, pleading, unguarded. “For… her.”</p><p>Something shifted in Wanda’s face. The sharp wit softened. She didn’t tease, not right away. She studied Rio — really studied her. The way her broad shoulders hunched, not from pride but from fear of breaking. The way her dark eyes burned with something fierce and terrified all at once, a storm barely contained.</p><p>Wanda’s lips curved into the smallest smile, a teasing spark in her eyes, but her tone was careful, softer than usual. “So, the wolf wants ribbons and vows now?”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flushed darker. She ducked her head, but the corners of her mouth trembled — not quite shame, not quite hope. Her hand still pressed against her chest as if to anchor the words. “Yes.” The sound was rough, certain, her voice scraping but sure.</p><p>The teasing light in Wanda’s face eased into something quieter, reverent. She leaned forward, her elbows resting on her knees, her gaze never leaving Rio’s. The fire caught in her eyes, turning them molten, intent. “Hand-fasting isn’t just silk and knots. It’s binding. Two souls, twined by vow and touch, witnessed by those you trust, and by the moon itself. It is older than any council decree. Older than Salem.”</p><p>Rio listened like her life depended on it, her chest rising and falling fast, her dark eyes wide and locked on Wanda. She barely blinked, every muscle taut as though she might carve the words into her very bones if she could.</p><p>Wanda’s voice gentled even further, her words like thread weaving through the stillness. “It means, simply: ‘I choose you. In every season, in every shadow, in every light. I will walk beside you, bound, until death unties us.’”</p><p>The words landed heavy in the small cottage, sinking deep. Rio’s throat bobbed as she swallowed hard, her hand pressing tighter to her chest. Her eyes shimmered faintly in the dim light — not tears, not yet, but something unsteady, something breaking open inside her.</p><p>Wanda’s gaze warmed, her throat tightening with something unspoken. She reached across the space and touched Rio’s hand lightly. “But before the knot, there is a tradition. You must ask her. A proposal — spoken aloud, offered freely. You place your vow in her hands and wait for her to answer. Only then can the hand-fasting be bound.”</p><p>Rio froze, her eyes widening slightly, as though the task were heavier, but clearer now.</p><p>Wanda gave her hand the gentlest squeeze. “You don’t need fancy words. You don’t need silk or gold. You need only speak the truth. That’s all Agatha has ever wanted from you.”</p><p>Rio sat hunched on the bench, her massive hands worrying the hem of her sleeve, as though words might come if she pulled the fabric apart thread by thread.</p><p>Wanda set down her pestle with a sigh, moving to sit across from her. “If you keep fidgeting, you’ll unravel that shirt before you unravel your tongue.”</p><p>Rio scowled faintly, but it lacked heat. Her lips pressed thin. “…Words. Hard.”</p><p>“They don’t have to be clever,” Wanda said gently. “You’re not wooing her with poetry. You’re asking her to bind her life to yours. All you need is truth.”</p><p>Rio’s dark eyes lifted, raw and searching.</p><p>Wanda held the gaze steady. “You tell her what she is to you. What you see when you look at her. And you ask if she’ll stand with you — in light, in shadow, in everything to come.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, her jaw flexing. Slowly, haltingly, she rasped, “…Agatha. Mine. Always.”</p><p>The words were rough, clumsy, but they made Wanda’s throat tighten. She reached across, squeezing Rio’s fist. “Yes. That’s the heart of it.”</p><p>She leaned back, her voice softening. “But you’ll need a token. Something she can keep, to mark the vow until the hand-fasting itself. In the old ways, that meant a ribbon, or a ring if you could manage one. It doesn’t matter what — only that it comes from you.”</p><p>Rio blinked at her, frowning in thought.</p><p>Wanda’s lips curved faintly. “You’ll think of something. A knot, a circle, something that says ‘this is us.’ She’ll understand. She’ll treasure it.”</p><p>Rio’s throat worked, her fists curling tight. The weight of it all pressed heavy, but her eyes burned with determination now.</p><p>“Good,” Wanda said, softer. She stood, brushing her palms together. “Practice it if you must. But remember — she loves you. She’ll hear even the roughest word as if it were music.”</p><p>Rio ducked her head, her lashes low, but the faintest flush crept across her cheeks.</p><p>And in that quiet, with Wanda’s guidance still echoing, she began to picture it: standing before Agatha, speaking the vow, placing a token in her hands.</p><p>Forever.</p><p><br/>——</p><p> </p><p>The door creaked open on a gust of cold air, and Rio stepped inside, clutching a bundle of dried sage close to her chest. She shook the mist from her shoulders, dark hair clinging damp to her temples.</p><p>Agatha glanced up from her chair by the window, where she had been mending a hem. Her eyes, sharp as ever, softened when they landed on Rio.</p><p>“You were gone longer than sage ought to take,” she remarked, arching a brow. “Don’t tell me Wanda tried to keep you with one of her endless riddles.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze flicked to her, then down again, almost guilty. She set the bundle on the table with more care than sage deserved, her shoulders drawn tight.</p><p>Agatha watched her a moment longer, lips twitching at the edges. “Ah,” she murmured, “so it wasn’t Wanda’s riddles. Something else has your head all tangled.”</p><p>Rio shifted, restless, her hands hovering over the sage as if arranging it might buy her time. She shook her head, a faint flush creeping into her cheeks.</p><p>“Mm.” Agatha set her needle aside and rose, her nightdress brushing the floor as she crossed the room. “Distracted silence. Very telling.”</p><p>Rio glanced up, caught.</p><p>Agatha’s smirk curved into something gentler as she brushed a damp strand of hair from Rio’s brow. <br/>“Well? Out with it. Have you burned down half the village and you’re afraid I’ll scold you?”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched at that, a low huff escaping — half a laugh, half a protest.</p><p>“No?” Agatha teased, tilting her head. “Then perhaps you’ve made a bargain with Wanda. She does love to collect debts.”</p><p>Rio shook her head more firmly this time, but her dark eyes gave her away — something flickered there, something warm and nervous all at once.</p><p>Agatha studied her a moment longer before leaning closer, her hand sliding over Rio’s where it still hovered on the sage. Her voice dropped, playful but soft.</p><p>“Whatever it is, my love, it can’t be worse than my imagination. And you know how wicked that is.”<br/>Rio’s throat worked, but no words came. She ducked her head again, a faint whine in her chest, as if the secret were pressing too heavy to carry but too precious to loose.</p><p>Agatha smiled despite herself, kissed the crown of her head, and let her be. “Very well,” she whispered. “Keep your mystery a little longer. But don’t think I won’t pry it out of you.”</p><p><br/>———</p><p>Rio had little to her name. The forest had given her strength, and Agatha had given her a home — but of her own possessions, there was almost nothing. Nothing that seemed worthy of Agatha.</p><p>She sat in the dim quiet, her hands restless in her lap. On the table before her lay a small collection she had gathered over the years: a river stone, a bit of bone, scraps of leather worn soft. She turned each over in her rough hands, frowning. None of it spoke enough. None of it felt right.</p><p>Her gaze drifted lower, to the pouch she rarely opened, tucked beneath her cloak. Fingers trembling, she loosened the leather tie and spilled its contents into her palm.</p><p>An iron link.</p><p>Dull with rust, heavy for its size. One piece from the chain that had once held her by the throat, collar biting into her skin as the waves battered the wreck. She had kept it — she didn’t know why. A reminder, perhaps. Or proof of what she had survived.</p><p>But now, as she held it, she thought of something else.</p><p>Agatha. The night she had found her. The sharp crack of power as the collar fell, the sudden freedom that burned through Rio’s lungs like fire. Agatha had been the one to free her. Agatha had been the first thing she saw as herself.</p><p>Her thumb dragged across the rusted curve. The metal bit faintly into her skin, as it always had. But this time, it was different. It wasn’t just a chain. It was the proof of what Agatha had broken. What she had given back.</p><p>Her chest ached. The word she couldn’t speak formed anyway in her mind. Forever.</p><p>Rio turned the link over again and again before curling her hand tightly around it. Not polished. Not pretty. But it was truth. And it was hers.</p><p>When she gave it to Agatha, she knew — she would be giving her everything.<br/>———</p><p><br/>Rio sat stiffly on the bench, shoulders hunched, her hand clenched tight around something small and dark. The firelight painted her skin in copper and shadow, but her eyes never left her closed fist.</p><p>Wanda leaned against the table, arms folded, watching with that steady patience Rio was beginning to know well. Finally, she lifted her chin toward Rio’s hand. “Show me.”</p><p>A beat of hesitation. Then Rio uncurled her fingers.</p><p>In her palm lay a piece of iron, pitted and rough, the faint curve of a link still visible. Wanda frowned at first, not in disapproval, but in curiosity. “What is it?”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, her throat working. She brushed her thumb over the metal, and her lips parted, forming the halting word she knew: “Chain.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes softened instantly. “From the collar.”</p><p>Rio nodded, the motion sharp, almost ashamed. She shifted, her chest tight, her voice low and rough. <br/>“Agatha.” A pause, then she forced the words, clumsy but heavy with meaning. “She… broke.”</p><p>Understanding dawned. Wanda’s gaze dropped to the link, then back to Rio’s face, her expression unreadable for a long moment. At last, she reached forward, her fingers brushing lightly over the iron. </p><p>“Then it is perfect. No jewel or gold could hold more meaning than this.”</p><p>Rio blinked, startled, as though she had expected laughter, dismissal.</p><p>Wanda smiled faintly. “But if you want her to wear it, she cannot very well tie it to her hand with string.”</p><p>She lifted the iron, rolling it between her fingers. A spark of red glimmered across her palm, seeping into the metal, bending it as if it were clay. The rough link softened, curled, reshaped. Slowly, it thinned into a circle, uneven still, but unmistakably ring-like.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught, her eyes widening. She reached out gently, touching the transformed band.</p><p>“Better,” Wanda said quietly, handing it back. “Not perfect. But then, love never is.”</p><p>Rio clutched the ring tight, her hand trembling.</p><p>“Now,” Wanda went on, pushing away from the table, “you must practice. Agatha will expect words. A promise.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed, panic flickering across her face. She shook her head.</p><p>“Yes,” Wanda said firmly, but kindly. “Not many. Only yours. Say them.”</p><p>Rio looked at the ring, then at Wanda, her mouth opening and closing soundlessly.</p><p>Wanda stepped closer, her tone gentler. “Say what you want her to know, when you plcae this in her hand.”</p><p>Rio’s chest rose and fell fast, her throat working. She clenched the ring, shut her eyes, and forced it out. “Mine. Family. Always.”</p><p>Her voice cracked on the last word.</p><p>Wanda’s lips curved, her eyes gleaming faintly with warmth. She reached out, laying a hand on Rio’s shoulder. “It will be enough. She will understand.”</p><p>Rio opened her eyes, dark and fierce now, the ring glinting in her hand. She gave a single, determined nod.</p><p>She would ask. She would vow. And this time, no chain in the world would hold her from it.</p><p> </p><p>The cottage smelled of rosemary and onions, the stewpot bubbling softly over the fire. Agatha stood at the table, sleeves rolled high, hair curling loose at her temples from the steam. She was slicing bread when the door creaked behind her.</p><p>She didn’t look up immediately, only called over her shoulder with a faint, knowing smirk: “So… what was it you had to show Wanda that kept you half the day?”</p><p>Rio hesitated in the doorway, her broad frame caught in the flicker of firelight. Her hands were empty, her heart pounding so fiercely she could hear it in her ears. She had practiced the words with Wanda a dozen times, but now they tangled uselessly on her tongue. Still, her body carried her forward. Each step was deliberate, anchored by the thought of Agatha’s face, of her laughter, of the child she carried.</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, slicing knife poised. Her sharp eyes flicked over Rio’s solemn expression, and her smirk softened. </p><p>“Well? Don’t tell me it was a secret recipe after all that mystery.”</p><p>Instead of answering, Rio reached for Agatha’s hand. The touch grounded her, warm and alive, though her fingers shook as they curled around hers. Slowly, she turned Agatha’s palm upward and placed something cold and dark against it — a small, rough circle of iron, hammered into the shape of a crooked ring.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. For a heartbeat she forgot to breathe at all. Her wit failed her as her gaze fixed on the crude ring resting in her palm. Recognition came swiftly, painfully.</p><p>“This… this is from the chain, isn’t it? The one I…”</p><p>The one I cut from your throat. The one that kept you bound. The memory stung her chest.</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened. Her throat burned with the effort of forming words, but she forced them out, each one heavy with meaning. She dropped to one knee, never breaking eye contact. Her other hand clutched Agatha’s like a lifeline.<br/> “Tie… Us. Family. Always.”</p><p>Agatha’s knife slipped from her hand, clattering to the floor with a dull thud. The bread scattered uselessly, forgotten. Her lips parted, her voice suddenly small, disbelieving. </p><p>“Rio… are you asking… do you mean to marry me?”</p><p>Rio nodded once, fierce and certain, her dark eyes shining with unspoken devotion. </p><p>She didn’t know how to shape the thousand things she wanted to say — about belonging, about forever, about never letting Agatha face another night alone — so she poured it into that one desperate, pleading word. </p><p>“Please.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest ached as if her heart might burst. For weeks she had held her together, had feared every day might be the last — and now here Rio knelt, offering her not sorrow, not survival, but a future. </p><p>Her throat constricted as laughter tangled with tears, breaking her open.</p><p>She dropped to her knees, cupping Rio’s face with both trembling hands. Her laugh came out shaky, wet, but full of wonder. </p><p>“Yes. Yes, of course, yes. You impossible, beautiful creature.”</p><p>Her hands shook as she slid the crooked iron onto her finger. Cold, rough, imperfect — and more precious than any jewel ever could be. She held it up toward the firelight, her tears spilling freely. </p><p>“Made of the chain I once cut from you. And now you make it ours.”</p><p>Her voice faltered, breaking on the truth of it. She pressed her forehead to Rio’s, her lips brushing her temple. “No chains. No bindings. Only us.”</p><p>Rio let out a broken sound — part sob, part relief — her whole body trembling as she wrapped Agatha in her arms. She held her close, breathing her in, as if letting go would unravel her entirely. </p><p>In that moment, the world shrank to just the two of them and the life growing between them.</p><p>The stew bubbled forgotten. The bread lay half-sliced. And in the glow of the hearth, witch and wolf bound themselves not with ribbons or law, but with iron and love, fierce and unbreakable.</p><p>They were still wrapped in each other’s arms, breathless from the tenderness of it, when a knock came at the door. Not hurried, not polite, but brisk — as if the person on the other side already knew they were welcome.</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, reluctant to move, but Rio squeezed her hand and went to the door.</p><p>Wanda stood there, cloak loose about her shoulders, a sly smile tugging her lips. In one hand she held a bottle of deep red wine, in the other a jug of sweetened cordial.</p><p>“I knew it,” she said simply, stepping inside without waiting for an invitation. Her eyes glittered as they flicked from Rio’s flushed face to Agatha’s tear-bright eyes. </p><p>“The air was humming all the way from the square. And besides…” she raised the cordial with a flourish, “…I had a feeling you’d need this tonight.”</p><p>Agatha let out a startled laugh, shaking her head, though her cheeks glowed pink. </p><p>“You never could resist meddling.”</p><p>“Not meddling,” Wanda countered, setting the bottles on the table with a decisive thud. “Celebrating.”</p><p>Rio closed the door, her lips twitching into the faintest, shyest smile. She crossed back to Agatha’s side instantly, as though afraid of losing the warmth she’d only just claimed. Agatha curled into her, her hand resting protectively over her belly, her other twined with Rio’s.</p><p>The door knocked again — lighter this time, followed by the sound of small feet shuffling against the step.</p><p>Lilia and Althea entered with Cora between them, the child already grinning as though she knew a secret. </p><p>“Wanda told us,” Althea said, her eyes warm and shining. “We couldn’t stay away.”</p><p>Cora wriggled free of her mother’s hand and darted across the room, launching herself at Rio with all the force her little body could muster. “You’re getting married!” she squealed, her arms wrapping around Rio’s waist. “You and Agatha!”</p><p>Cora launched herself into Rio’s arms, and Rio caught her with ease, spinning her once just to make her laugh. The child squealed, clinging to her neck as though she had been waiting all day for this.</p><p>“She’s absolutely besotted with you,” Althea said, shaking her head with mock severity, though her smile betrayed her. “I sometimes wonder if she’d choose you over her own bed.”</p><p>She glanced at Agatha with a knowing look before adding, “When Wanda told us about the proposal on her way here, this one nearly hit the roof.” She ruffled Cora’s hair fondly, the girl beaming as though the memory itself was proof enough.</p><p>Cora buried her face into Rio’s shoulder at that, giggling so hard she hiccupped, her small hands fisting tight in the fabric of Rio’s shirt.</p><p>Agatha watched them, her chest aching in that sharp-sweet way only love could make it. Rio held the girl so naturally, so steady and tender, that Agatha’s hand drifted almost unconsciously over the curve of her own belly. A quiet smile tugged at her lips, pride and longing twined together.</p><p>And even with Cora in her arms, Rio’s free hand sought Agatha’s without hesitation, their fingers lacing as though nothing — not laughter, not chaos, not even time itself — could pull them apart.</p><p>At the table, Wanda lifted her cup, crimson glinting in the firelight. “To family,” she said simply, her voice warm but carrying weight, her eyes glistening with more than the glow of wine. “Chosen, made, and bound.”</p><p>The words settled over the room like a blessing, met with a chorus of clinks, murmured echoes, and Cora’s delighted laugh.</p><p>And in that moment, with warmth pressing in on every side, Agatha and Rio felt the future draw closer, steady and sure.</p><p>The cottage rang with laughter and clinking cups late into the night, but to Agatha and Rio, it all blurred into one long, golden moment. Cora refused to leave Rio’s lap, Wanda teased until Agatha threatened to hex her, and Althea and Lilia exchanged those looks only family could — half worry, half joy, all love.</p><p>And then, as though the night itself had spilled forward, the weeks began to blur.</p><p>Word of the proposal rippled through Salem faster than smoke in wind. At first a whisper, then a certainty: the witch and the wolf would be bound.</p><p>The village changed with it. Seamstresses pulled out their finest linens, muttering over dyes and needles. Bakers argued over sweet breads and spice cakes. Lanterns were patched, polished, and strung across crooked beams in the square. Even the council, still stiff with unease, could not quell the tide of anticipation.</p><p>Everywhere they went, Agatha and Rio were met with nods, with questions, with murmured blessings and sly smiles. For the first time, Salem seemed not to shrink from them but to bend around them — as though all its crooked streets and soot-stained windows leaned toward the promise of vows yet to be spoken.</p><p>And through it all, Rio’s hand never left Agatha’s. Whether guiding her through the market crowds or resting protectively at her back when the nights grew cold, she kept her steady, grounded, safe. Agatha, swelling softly now at the belly, only teased her for fussing, though the quiet curve of her smile betrayed how much it soothed her.</p><p>The days blurred into nights, and the nights into dawns. And still, it felt as though all of Salem was preparing for one thing: the hand-fasting of the witch and the wolf.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had protested from the moment the idea was raised.<br/> She didn’t want to leave Agatha’s side, not even for an hour. But Wanda had been insistent — that Agatha needed quiet to dress, that tradition demanded separation before vows, that even the witch herself deserved a moment of calm without Rio pacing at her shoulder.</p><p>So Rio had been led — reluctantly, stiff-backed — to Lilia’s cottage, while Wanda stayed behind to help Agatha prepare. Every step away from her felt wrong, like a tether stretched taut, straining. She muttered once under her breath, words rough but certain: <em>don’t leave her</em>.</p><p>And Lilia, catching it, only gave her a sharp, knowing look. “She’s safe. Trust her — and trust me.”</p><p>Now, the morning of the handfasting dawned sharp and cold, mist curling over the cobblestones like breath. Salem was awake early — too early — bustling in a way Rio had never seen before.</p><p>She felt it the moment she stepped into the square. Hands everywhere, tugging, fastening, smoothing. Voices spilling over one another like rushing water.<br/>“Hold still—” “The cuffs, she needs them straight—” “Shoes, someone fetch the shoes—”</p><p>Rio blinked hard, her chest already tight as the air swarmed with sound and motion. A cloak was stripped from her shoulders, replaced with a dark, finely cut jacket that smelled faintly of rosemary. Her shirt was pulled taut, buttons fastened, her hair smoothed down by hands she didn’t recognise. Someone pressed a pair of polished shoes into her grip — shinier than water, catching the weak sunlight in sharp flashes.</p><p>She swallowed hard. Her fists clenched and unclenched. The world pressed too close, their eyes on her, their hands on her, and her breath wouldn’t steady.</p><p>She hadn’t wanted this. Not the staring. Not the fuss. She wanted Agatha, her hand in hers, nothing more.<br/>And then —<br/>“Enough.”<br/>Lilia’s voice cut like a blade. The fussing hands stilled. A dozen pairs of eyes blinked at her sharp gaze.<br/>“Out. All of you. Now.”</p><p>The townsfolk hesitated, muttering, until Lilia clapped her hands once — and like scolded hens, they scattered, leaving Rio alone in the quiet.</p><p>The silence fell heavy. Only then did Rio realise her chest was heaving, her throat raw from the effort of swallowing back panic.</p><p>Lilia stepped closer, her sharp features softened now, her voice quieter. “Breathe, child. Just breathe.”<br/>Rio dragged in a breath, shallow and ragged. Her eyes flicked down to the shoes in her hand, gleaming like glass, foreign, wrong.</p><p>“I can’t…” she started, the words rough, breaking. “Too much. Too many.”</p><p>Lilia’s hand found her shoulder, firm, steady. “Do you think she cares for the polish of your shoes? Or for silk at your collar?” Her eyes glinted, dark but kind. “She has already chosen you. Long before this day, long before the ribbons. This—” she gestured to the square, the bustle beyond “—is for them. Not her. Not you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes burned. Her jaw trembled.</p><p>Lilia’s voice softened further. “When the time comes, you look only at her. No one else. You tie yourself to her, not to their eyes, not to their whispers. Only her. Do you understand?”</p><p>Rio’s throat worked, a choked sound escaping. She nodded, once, hard.</p><p>Lilia gave her shoulder a squeeze. “Good. Now breathe, and remember — you were never meant to be tamed. Not by chains, not by silk, not by Salem. Only by love.”</p><p>And for the first time that morning, Rio’s chest loosened. Her hands steadied. The shoes still gleamed like water, but her gaze wasn’t fixed on them anymore.</p><p>She was ready to face the crowd. Because at the end of it, she’d face Agatha.</p><p>At home, the cottage was quiet — save for Wanda’s steady movements and Agatha’s impatient sighs.<br/>“Hold still,” Wanda chided, tugging gently at the ribbon she was tying around Agatha’s sleeve. “If you fidget, I’ll have to redo it.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, though her lips curved with a faint smirk. “Not fidgeting. I am… restless. There’s a difference.”</p><p>“You sound like Rio,” Wanda murmured, tugging the knot into place.</p><p>At that, Agatha’s smile softened, her gaze flicking toward the door as though she could sense her wolf pacing elsewhere in Salem. Her hand came to rest unconsciously against the slight swell of her belly, protective, tender. Her voice slipped quiet, almost unguarded. </p><p>“Does she seem alright?”</p><p>Wanda’s hands stilled for just a moment. Then she smoothed the ribbon down, her voice gentle but firm. “She’ll be fine. Lilia knows what she’s doing. And Rio would walk barefoot into fire if it meant standing by you.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened, the softness in her eyes shining through before she caught herself. She gave a brisk sniff, shoulders squaring as if nothing had happened. “Yes, well. She’s not meant to walk into fire today. Just into vows.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled softly. She stepped back, eyeing the gown she had pressed into Agatha’s hands earlier. Deep indigo, trimmed simply but elegantly, the fabric soft enough to move but rich enough to glow in firelight. “You’ll stop hearts in that. Though only one that matters.”</p><p>Agatha smirked again, but it wavered. She looked down at her hands where they knotted in her lap, the knuckles pale. “It feels… odd. To have Salem watching. I never sought their eyes, not for anything.”</p><p>“They will watch,” Wanda agreed. She tilted her head, studying Agatha with quiet intensity. “But they will see what I see. What Rio sees. You.”</p><p>For a heartbeat, Agatha’s composure cracked. Her lips parted, her lashes damp with the emotion she tried to blink back. “And what if I falter? What if I don’t deserve…” Her voice trailed off, too raw to finish.</p><p>Wanda’s hand hovered, then rested lightly on Agatha’s arm, steadying. “You are exactly where you are meant to be. And she already knows.”</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet, shaky laugh — quick, breathless, betraying the nerves she would not otherwise confess. She cleared her throat and pulled her mask back into place, lifting her chin. “Careful, Maximoff. Keep talking like that and people might think you like me.”</p><p>Wanda only smiled, unshaken. She retrieved the shawl from the chair and draped it carefully over Agatha’s shoulders.</p><p>Agatha’s chest rose and fell unevenly. Her hands lingered on the shawl, her eyes flicking briefly, longingly toward the door again. “She’ll be looking for me.”</p><p>“She always is,” Wanda said.</p><p>The words settled between them like truth carved into stone.</p><p>Agatha inhaled, then let the breath go slow. Her eyes glittered faintly as she finally allowed herself to smile, soft and certain, the mask slipping into something truer.</p><p>“Then let’s not keep her waiting.”</p><p>Wanda gave a quiet nod, her lips curving as though she’d heard every tremor beneath the words. She swept open the door, letting the crisp night air spill in, cool and bright with the shimmer of lanterns already strung across Salem’s crooked streets.</p><p>Agatha stepped out, her shawl wrapped close, her pulse thrumming so wildly she swore the whole town might hear it.</p><p>At Lilia’s, the little parlour had been chaos only moments ago — wives bustling in and out, tugging at cuffs, setting shoes at Rio’s feet polished to a mirror shine, smoothing the stiff collar that had her fidgeting like a restless child.</p><p>Now the room was emptied, save for Rio standing stiff as oak in her suit, shoulders locked, chest rising too fast. Her dark hair had been pulled back with neat care, but loose strands fell into her eyes where sweat already beaded.</p><p>At her side, Cora hovered with the unshakable ease only a child could carry. She slipped her small hand into Rio’s, swinging it as though this night were no more serious than a summer stroll. “Don’t be scared,” she said with quiet certainty, her grin wide and proud. “You look like a storybook knight.”</p><p>Rio’s throat tightened. She glanced down at the child, and for the first time that evening her lips twitched into something like a smile.</p><p>Cora squeezed her hand again. “I’ll stay with you until she comes. Then you won’t be nervous anymore.”</p><p>And so she did. From Lilia’s parlour to the square itself, Cora walked at Rio’s side, her presence a tether in the dark.</p><p>The square glowed with fire pits and lanterns, banners rippling faintly in the cool night air. Villagers filled the cobblestones in clusters, their voices a soft hum, their cloaks brushing as they shifted.</p><p>Rio stood at the edge of the square, tall but rigid, her heart hammering like a drum. Her hands clenched and unclenched at her sides, palms damp, jaw tight. Only Cora’s squeeze at her fingers kept her steady.</p><p>Then — the sound.</p><p>A violin. Soft, lilting, trembling through the night air like the voice of the moon itself.</p><p>The crowd shifted, a ripple moving through them.</p><p>And Agatha stepped into the square.</p><p>Her indigo gown shimmered in the firelight, the fabric heavy and graceful, her dark hair loose over her shoulders, her hand resting gently against the curve of her belly. The music seemed to bend toward her, the bow’s quiver rising and falling with her steps. She walked steady, proud, her chin lifted — but her eyes, when they found Rio across the square, softened at once.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught. The world seemed to still — firelight flickering slower, banners swaying gentler, the hum of voices falling away until only the violin carried. </p><p>There was only Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted faintly, her steps slowing as she saw the way Rio was staring — raw, unguarded, undone. Heat flared in her chest, her own nerves easing with the knowledge that Rio looked at her as though she were the only soul in Salem.</p><p>They stood facing one another now, the hum of the crowd a distant haze, the violin swelling softly between them.</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, her mouth tugging into that wry, familiar smile. “Well,” she murmured softly enough that only Rio could hear, “don’t you clean up nicely.”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, her fists flexing once at her sides before her dark eyes lifted again, steady, burning. “For… you.”</p><p>Something in Agatha’s chest fractured — soft, aching, full. Her smile wavered, her throat tightening. “Oh, my love.”</p><p>For that moment, nothing else mattered — not the crowd, not the council, not even the firelight. Only the two of them, standing in the square, about to bind their lives together under the eyes of the moon.</p><p>The violin’s bow drew across the strings, and the note hung in the air like a breath held too long. It quivered, tender and aching, carrying over the fire lit square until every voice hushed, every lantern seemed to burn brighter.</p><p>Rio’s pulse thundered in her ears, louder than the crackle of the flames, louder than the murmur of Salem gathered close. </p><p>But all she saw was Agatha.</p><p>Her eyes — sharp to the world, soft only for Rio — found her and did not look away.</p><p>From the front row, Wanda’s lips curved, her eyes damp though her arms folded tight across her chest as if to mask it. Lilia’s face was grave but glowing, her dark gaze fixed unblinking on the couple as though etching every second into memory. Althea stood close, a steadying hand on Cora, though the child needed none — her wide eyes shone with joy, and she bounced on her toes, whispering to her mother, “<em>She looks like a queen</em>.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught, her chest aching with the sheer force of it. She barely felt the officiant step between them, barely heard the murmured invocation:<br/>“Two souls, two paths, two lives. This night, under the eye of moon and flame, they choose to bind as one.”</p><p>Indigo and black silk glimmered in the elder’s hands. She laid it across their joined palms. Rio’s calloused fingers shook, but Agatha’s were steady — warm, elegant, curling over hers with the gentlest press. A silent vow.</p><p>The ribbon fell cool against their skin, sliding like water as it twined them wrist to wrist.</p><p>“Do you choose,” the elder asked, voice carrying like a spell, “to walk together, through shadow and light, through loss and plenty, through death and beyond?”</p><p>“I do,” Agatha said first. Her voice did not waver. Her lips trembled at the corners, but her gaze stayed locked on Rio, fierce and unflinching.</p><p>A small sob escaped Wanda, quickly muffled as she pressed her fingers to her lips. Lilia exhaled sharply through her nose, a proud, quiet sound, while Althea drew Cora closer — though the little girl leaned forward, whispering fiercely, “Say it, Rio. Say it now.”</p><p>Rio’s chest rose, fell, her throat working. For a moment words stuck — then broke free, low, rough, reverent.<br/> “I do.”</p><p>The violin swelled, soaring into the night like a heartbeat set to music.</p><p>The ribbon knotted once, twice, silk binding them firm and final.</p><p>“Then let it be known,” the elder intoned, voice ringing clear, “these two are bound — by will, by vow, by love — until the moon itself wanes to nothing.”</p><p>The crowd erupted — voices shouting, hands clapping, cheers echoing against the crooked rooftops. Flames leapt higher, sparks spinning into the autumn air.</p><p>Wanda lifted her hands to clap, but her tears betrayed her, spilling freely as she laughed shakily through them. Lilia’s head bowed for a moment in reverence before she straightened, her eyes shining. Althea bent to kiss Cora’s temple, murmuring something tender as the child squealed with delight, clapping so furiously her little palms turned red.</p><p>But Rio heard none of it. She saw only Agatha.</p><p>Agatha leaned in, brow touching hers, her breath soft against her lips. Her eyes glistened, but her smirk curled sharp and familiar. “Well, my darling wolf, it seems you’ve tied yourself to me.”</p><p>Rio’s chest broke open, her free hand rising to cradle Agatha’s face with trembling reverence. “Always,” she rasped, the word a vow deeper than blood.</p><p>And then Agatha kissed her.</p><p>The violin soared, the fire roared, the village thundered their joy — but for them, the world fell away. There was only silk knotted tight around their hands, the pulse of a child glowing steady between them, and the unshakable truth that nothing — not curse, not shadow, not even death — would unbind them again.</p><p> </p>

<p>Time turned, steady as the tide, and with it their lives reshaped.</p><p>Winter passed in quiet patience. Salem lay hushed beneath frost, smoke curling from chimneys, the river hardened to glass. In the cottage, life was anything but still. Althea, firm yet endlessly patient, had taken it upon herself to school Rio alongside Cora. At the table they sat, chalk and slate before them, Cora’s tongue poking out in concentration while Rio frowned fiercely over her letters, her rough hands clumsy but determined. When Cora giggled at Rio’s mistakes, Rio only growled softly, making the child laugh harder until even Althea’s sternness melted into a smile.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lilia guided Agatha’s restless hands into softer work. Needles clicked in the hearthlight as she showed her how to knit small garments — tiny bonnets, socks so small they looked like doll’s. </p><p>Agatha scoffed, claiming her wit was wasted on such domesticity, yet her cheeks warmed when Rio picked up each finished piece with reverence. “Hormones,” she muttered when Wanda caught her dabbing her eyes at the sight of a half-finished shawl. But no sharp tongue could disguise the softness growing in her.</p><p>And then spring broke open.</p><p>Snow melted to streams, crocuses pushing through thawed earth, the world itself reborn. The cottage smelled of damp earth and rosemary, windows thrown wide to let in the warming air. Agatha moved heavily now, her hand always at her rounded belly, her steps slower, her breath shorter. Rio never strayed from her side, steadying her when the weight grew too much, fetching whatever she reached for before she could ask.</p><p>One morning, as the garden bloomed, the moment came.</p><p>Rio crouched with Cora at her side, their hands dark with earth as they pressed neat rows of seeds into the ground.<br/>Cora chattered between tasks, her braids bouncing as she leaned into the dirt. “Grandmother says if we plant carrots first, they’ll come sweet. And turnips too. Do wolves even eat turnips, Rio?”</p><p>Rio’s mouth twitched faintly, her dark eyes glancing up from the soil. “Eat… anything,” she rumbled, a trace of amusement softening her usual brevity.</p><p>Cora giggled, clutching the small basket of seeds to her chest. She liked planting with Rio — the wolf never laughed at her crooked rows, never hurried her when she took too long. She only worked steady, patient, her big hands careful with even the tiniest seed.</p><p>The moment was calm. Almost ordinary. Until the cry split the air.</p><p>It wasn’t birdsong or village chatter, but raw and human — a scream, tearing from inside the cottage.<br/>Rio froze. The trowel fell from her hand, sinking forgotten into the soil. Her ears pricked sharp, her chest heaving. Another cry followed, sharper this time, and the sound drove her to her feet in an instant.</p><p>“Agatha.” Her voice cracked, strangled by panic. She bolted for the door, Cora stumbling after her with wide, frightened eyes.</p><p>They burst inside to find Agatha braced against the bedpost, her face slick with sweat, her breath ragged. She cried out again, bending forward as her belly clenched hard.</p><p>Rio rushed to her, hands trembling, trying to steady her arms. “What—help—”<br/>Agatha snapped her gaze up, eyes blazing even through the pain. “Don’t you dare fall apart now,” she hissed, before another scream tore from her throat.</p><p>Cora stood frozen, clutching the doorframe, her small chest heaving with fright.</p><p>Rio turned, desperate, her voice breaking. “Fetch them—Lilia—Althea—now!”</p><p>The command jolted Cora into motion. She darted from the cottage like a spark, her bare feet pounding the lane, her cries carrying through the misty morning.</p><p>Inside, Rio held fast, frantic and shaking, her forehead pressed to Agatha’s as she tried to keep her upright through the waves of pain.</p><p>“Stay,” she whispered again and again, as though the word itself could anchor her.</p><p>Minutes stretched like hours until the door banged open, Cora tumbling back in, gasping for breath. Behind her, Lilia swept in, Althea close at her heels, carrying bundles of cloth and herbs.</p><p>“Ease her down,” Lilia ordered, already moving to Agatha’s side. “Althea, water. Quickly.”</p><p>Rio obeyed, lowering Agatha carefully to the bed, though her own hands shook so badly she could barely unclasp her grip. Agatha screamed again, burying her face against Rio’s chest, and Rio sobbed into her hair, helpless and terrified.</p><p>Cora pressed herself into her grandmother’s skirts, her little face pale but proud as she whispered, “I ran fast, Grandmother. I didn’t stop.”</p><p>“You did great little one,” Lilia murmured without looking up, her hands already working with swift, steady care.</p><p>And so it began — the storm of birth. Agatha’s cries filled the cottage, Rio’s panic thick as a heartbeat, and Cora’s wide eyes watching as the women of Salem gathered to bring new life into the world.</p><p>Hours seemed to bend, folding in on themselves. Agatha’s cries rose and fell with each wave of pain, her voice hoarse, her body slick with sweat.</p><p>Rio stayed pressed to her side through it all, clutching her hand with such desperation her own knuckles had gone white. Her dark eyes never left Agatha’s face, wild with fear. Every time Agatha screamed, Rio flinched as though struck herself.</p><p>“Breathe, wolf,” Lilia snapped sharply at her, hands busy, her tone steady but urgent. “If you fall apart, she’ll tear you in two just to shut you up.”</p><p>Agatha gave a strangled laugh through her sob, then another scream broke it apart. Rio bent her head low, pressing frantic kisses to her temple. “Stay. Stay. Please…”</p><p>Althea moved like water, fetching cloths, dabbing Agatha’s brow, murmuring encouragement. Cora hovered near the hearth, clutching a small doll to her chest, her eyes wide and brimming.</p><p>The hours dragged. The room smelled of herbs and sweat, iron and ash. Shadows stretched long with the flicker of the lanterns as the night deepened outside.</p><p>At last, Lilia leaned close, her hands firm at Agatha’s knees. “Now, child. Now you push. Strong and steady. Do not fight the tide—ride it.”</p><p>Agatha screamed again, her back arching, fingers crushing into Rio’s hand. Rio cried out too, helpless, pressing her forehead to Agatha’s, their sobs tangled together.</p><p>And then— A cry.</p><p>Thin at first. Trembling. Then louder, stronger, filling the cottage with a sound like no other.</p><p>The world stilled.</p><p>Agatha collapsed back against the pillows, her chest heaving, tears streaming freely down her face. Rio froze, trembling, her dark eyes darting wildly until she saw it—Lilia lifting the tiny, wriggling bundle into the light.</p><p>A child. Their child. A boy.</p><p>And with him came light. Indigo, soft at first, then flaring brighter, wrapping the room in a glow that pulsed like a heartbeat. It spread across the walls, shimmering against every shadow, casting their faces in hues of moonlight and fire.</p><p>The babe’s fists flailed, his cries sharp, fierce, alive — and with each sound, the glow seemed to answer, thrumming through the air as though he was born of the moon itself.</p><p>Rio broke. <br/>A sob tore from her chest, loud and guttural, as though her body didn’t know how to hold so much feeling at once. She pressed her face into Agatha’s damp hair, shaking with relief, with awe, with love so raw it burned.</p><p>Agatha’s weak hand found her arm, squeezing. “Look,” she whispered hoarsely, her eyes shining even through exhaustion. “Rio—look.”</p><p>And Rio did. She lifted her head, staring as Lilia laid the baby gently into Agatha’s arms. Tiny, red-faced, still wailing, but perfect — and glowing faintly still, the indigo shimmer clinging to his skin like a blessing.</p><p>Agatha’s tears dripped onto the child’s cheeks as she kissed his brow, whispering words too soft to hear. Then she shifted, turning slightly, pressing the small bundle into Rio’s trembling hands.</p><p>Rio stared, wide-eyed, her breath caught in her throat. Her hands—scarred, calloused, made for earth and blade—curved so carefully around the fragile weight.</p><p>The boy blinked up at her through damp lashes, still crying, though softer now. The light seemed to soften with him, fading to a steady glow, as though content he had found his place.</p><p>Rio’s lips parted. A sound caught in her throat, broken, reverent. She bent low, her tears spilling freely onto the swaddling, whispering the only word she could manage.</p><p>“Mine.”</p><p>Agatha sobbed, her head dropping against Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>Lilia looked up from her work, her hands still busy but her eyes wet with pride. “Born in spring, as the prophecy foretold. Moon-born and strong.”</p><p>Althea smiled faintly, her voice thick. “Strong like his mothers.”</p><p>And little Cora, clutching her doll, whispered from the hearth, her eyes wide with wonder:<br/>“He’s beautiful.”</p><p>The cottage filled with the baby’s cries, with Agatha’s quiet sobs, with Rio’s trembling laughter. The indigo glow lingered around them, steady and soft, humming like the echo of a promise.</p><p>The night outside was dark, but inside the small room, there was only light.</p><p>The door creaked suddenly, the hinges groaning against the night’s silence. A draft swept in, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and smoke.</p><p>Wanda stood framed in the doorway, her cloak drawn tight around her shoulders, her face pale but her eyes burning with something fierce and bright.</p><p>“I came as quickly as I could,” she said, her voice low, urgent with apology. “I was away, but—” Her gaze swept the room, falling instantly on the glow that wrapped Agatha, Rio, and the child. Her breath hitched. “I felt it. I felt him.”</p><p>Agatha’s weary head turned, her lips curving faintly despite her exhaustion. “You missed the screaming,” she rasped, her voice raw but touched with dry humour.</p><p>Rio shot her a look — half exasperated, half adoring — as she cradled the boy closer against her chest. The baby fussed but settled almost at once, his small fist curling against her tunic.</p><p>Wanda stepped closer, her eyes glistening. “By the gods…” She reached out but did not touch, as though afraid her presence might shatter the moment. “So much power. And yet—” Her voice softened, her throat tightening. “So small. So new.”</p><p>Lilia, exhausted but watchful, nodded faintly toward her. “You’ll frighten him standing there gawking. Sit. See what love has made.”</p><p>Wanda sank slowly into the nearest chair, her gaze never leaving the glowing child. Her tears shimmered in the firelight, unhidden. “I have seen life born before,” she murmured. “But never like this. Never so… radiant.”<br/>Agatha leaned against Rio’s shoulder, her hand brushing the baby’s soft cheek. Her smile was fragile, breaking at the edges, but it was real. “He announced himself loudly enough.”<br/>Rio bent her head lower, pressing her lips to the baby’s crown. Her voice was a broken rasp, barely more than a whisper. “Perfect.”<br/>And for the first time since the battle, since blood and shadow and loss, Wanda let herself smile through her tears.<br/>“Salem will never be the same,” she said softly. “Not with him in the world.”</p><p>The cottage hummed with quiet movement. The chaos of birth had ebbed, leaving only the soft crackle of the fire and the fragile whimpering of new life.</p><p>Rio, still trembling with exhaustion and nerves, bent and gathered Agatha carefully into her arms. She was gentle but firm, her jaw clenched, her dark eyes wide with worry. Agatha, pale and sweat-damp, let her head rest against Rio’s shoulder, too weak to protest.</p><p>“Careful,” Lilia murmured, walking ahead of them toward the washroom. But her eyes softened at the sight — wolf carrying witch as though she weighed nothing, holding her like something both breakable and sacred.</p><p>“I got you,” Rio whispered hoarsely against Agatha’s hair, her voice thick with fear and awe. She pressed a kiss to her temple as she carried her through the doorway, the tremble in her arms betraying both exhaustion and devotion.</p><p>Behind them, Wanda had taken the newborn into her arms, swaddled snugly in soft linen. She rocked him instinctively, crimson-shadowed eyes glistening as she stared down at him.</p><p>“You’re strong already,” she murmured, brushing her thumb gently over his cheek. “So much power in someone so small.” A breath caught in her chest. “But more than power… you are loved.”</p><p>Cora hovered beside her, practically climbing into her lap, her curls bouncing as she leaned close. She gasped when the baby squirmed, his tiny hand clutching at her finger. “He likes me!” she squealed, her voice full of glee.</p><p>“He knows family when he feels it,” Wanda said softly, smiling as Cora whispered little promises of games and secrets into the baby’s ear.</p><p>At the hearth, Althea moved with quiet efficiency, setting water to boil, herbs crumbling beneath her hands. But her gaze strayed often to the newborn, her stern face softened by something close to wonder.<br/>From the washroom, Agatha’s tired, wry voice floated out, weak but sharp as ever. “Is he alright, Wanda? He’s quiet.”<br/>Rio gave a low grunt — part warning, part protest — as she adjusted her grip, still holding Agatha against her chest. Her hands were steady despite her shaking arms, her heart pounding too hard in her chest.</p><p>“He’s safe,” Wanda called back, her eyes still fixed on the child. Her lips curved faintly. “Though I’d say he already has an adoring shadow.” She tipped her head toward Cora, who was crooning over the swaddled boy with endless delight.</p><p>Agatha’s hand curled faintly into Rio’s tunic, her head lolling against her shoulder. “Good,” she murmured, almost too quiet to hear. “He’ll need it.”</p><p>The steam of the bath still lingered on Agatha’s skin when Rio carried her back through the narrow hall. </p><p>Her damp hair clung to her temples, her nightdress fresh, her body weakened but clean. She nestled close against Rio, too exhausted to lift her head, her hands curled against the wolf’s chest.</p><p>Rio lowered her carefully onto the bed, movements adoring, as though she feared she might shatter her with a touch. She pulled the blanket up over her legs, then lingered, crouching by the edge of the mattress, her dark eyes searching Agatha’s pale face with quiet desperation.</p><p>“You’re safe,” Rio whispered, her voice breaking in the low-lit room. Her calloused hand brushed Agatha’s cheek, her thumb trembling against damp skin. “Safe.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved faintly — weary, but unmistakably her. “For now,” she teased weakly, though her voice carried more love than wit. Her fingers caught Rio’s, squeezing lightly. “Because of you.”</p><p>Before Rio could reply, Wanda stepped in, the baby swaddled securely in her arms. Cora trotted beside her, eyes huge, one hand gripping Wanda’s sleeve as though she could keep herself tethered to the child.</p><p>“Time for his mother,” Wanda said softly, her crimson-shadowed eyes warm as she looked down at Agatha. She shifted the bundle carefully into her arms.</p><p>The moment the weight settled against her chest, Agatha let out a sob — small, broken, but threaded with awe. She gazed down at the tiny boy, his dark lashes resting against flushed cheeks, his tiny fists curled tight against the linen. The faintest glow of indigo still pulsed around him, as though the moon itself had blessed his first hours.</p><p>“Oh, gods,” Agatha breathed, tears spilling as she pressed her lips to his downy brow. “He’s perfect.”</p><p>Rio’s throat worked as she leaned closer, her large hand hovering, hesitant, before Agatha caught it and guided it to their son’s chest. <br/>The baby shifted faintly, his tiny heartbeat fluttering against Rio’s palm.</p><p>Her breath caught, her eyes wet with wonder. “Mine,” Rio rasped, the word hoarse, reverent. “Ours.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her face up, her eyes shimmering through her tears. “Yes,” she whispered, her voice breaking into a smile. “Ours.”</p><p>Cora, bouncing impatiently at Wanda’s side, clapped her hands and whispered loudly, “He likes you already, Rio.”</p><p>Althea entered just then with steaming mugs of tea, her sternness softened, while Lilia hovered in the doorway, her sharp eyes glistening with pride.</p><p>The boy stirred faintly between them, a soft whimper pressing from his tiny lungs. Agatha rocked him gently against her chest, her lips brushing his brow. The indigo glow had faded to something subtler now, a faint warmth that hummed between mother and child.</p><p>Rio’s hand remained over the small rise of his chest, her dark eyes fixed on him with a wonder so raw it threatened to undo her. She had faced death in battle, in chains, in shadows — but nothing had ever frightened her more, or steadied her more, than this fragile, perfect heartbeat beneath her palm.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze lingered on the boy’s face, studying the curve of his nose, the pale line of his brow, the faintest trace of a pout on his lips. A laugh broke from her throat, cracked with exhaustion and awe.</p><p>“He looks like trouble already.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth twitched — the ghost of a smile. She pressed her forehead lightly to Agatha’s temple, silent but steady, as if to anchor them both.</p><p>The room hushed around them, family watching but not intruding. Althea held Cora back by the shoulders when the little girl tried to clamber closer, whispering that the baby needed his mother just a while longer.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened, a new light kindling through the haze of pain and exhaustion. She drew a breath, then said, quietly but certain:<br/>“Nicholas.”</p><p>Rio blinked, her brows knitting as she looked at her wife.</p><p>Agatha glanced down at the child again, her lips trembling into a tired, aching smile. “My uncle. He was the only one in my family who ever dared to protect me from her. From Evanora. He used to say the name meant ‘victory of the people.’” </p><p>Her throat tightened, tears stinging again. “I think it suits him. After all we’ve survived… after what he’s already given back to us.”</p><p>Her fingers brushed the baby’s cheek, reverent. “Nicholas Harkness-Vidal.”</p><p>Rio’s lips parted, her chest heaving. She repeated it, rough and certain: “Nicholas.” Her eyes shone as she looked at Agatha, then at their son. “Strong. Ours.”</p><p>Cora wriggled against Althea’s grip, blurting, “Nicky!” Her bright voice filled the room like sunlight, earning a soft laugh from Wanda, who dabbed her eyes under the guise of adjusting her shawl.</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders shook with a laugh-sob, the sound tender, broken, perfect. She kissed Nicholas’s brow once more, then leaned her temple against Rio’s.</p><p>“Welcome home, Nicholas,” she whispered.</p><p>And in that room — in the glow of spring, with tears, laughter, and love mingling — the name settled over him like a promise.</p><p><br/>The days after Nicholas’s birth blurred into a rhythm of hushed nights and soft mornings.</p><p>The cottage seemed to breathe differently now, the air thick with the sweet, sharp scent of milk and herbs, the quiet punctuated by the baby’s cries. Every corner held a new softness — baskets of swaddling cloth, half-finished knitting from Lilia, herbs strung to dry for calming teas.</p><p>Agatha, pale but fierce, refused to let Nicholas out of her arms longer than a few minutes. Even as her body ached and trembled, she kept him close, his tiny chest pressed to hers, her shawl always wrapped around them both. She would glare at anyone who dared suggest she rest longer — though more often than not, Rio was the only one bold enough to make her.</p><p>Rio was tireless. Where Agatha would not bend, she filled the spaces instead: rocking Nicholas through the night when he wailed, carrying wood and water with one arm while holding the baby against her shoulder with the other, crouching to soothe him with a soft hum that seemed more growl than lullaby.</p><p>And every time someone leaned close to peer at him, the murmur was the same:<br/>“He looks just like Rio.”</p><p>The curve of his brow. The slope of his cheekbones. The intensity in his gaze, dark and steady, even as a newborn.</p><p>Althea would laugh, shaking her head. “The same serious face. Saints save us, Salem will think the wolf has been born twice.”</p><p>Even Cora, hovering over Nicholas’s basket, whispered reverently, “Nicky’s like a little Rio.” She pressed her hands to her cheeks as though the thought were too wonderful to bear.</p><p>Wanda, quieter, only smiled each time, her eyes glistening as though she saw more than she would ever say.</p><p>Agatha tried to scoff at the constant observation, her sharp wit refusing to be silenced by something as simple as resemblance. But when Nicholas’s tiny hand curled around Rio’s finger, when his sleeping face mirrored hers with uncanny precision — she could not help the way her heart cracked open.</p><p>One night, as the spring rain pattered against the shutters, Agatha lay half-reclined against Rio’s chest, Nicholas sleeping between them. The indigo glow from her womb had faded now, but when the firelight touched the baby’s face, she swore she still saw it there — that tether, that moon-born spark.</p><p>“He is you,” Agatha whispered, her voice hushed but awed. “Entirely you. I… I think he always will be.”</p><p>Rio pressed her lips to Agatha’s temple, her arm tight around them both. “Ours,” she murmured again, as though the word itself was a spell, binding them in its truth.</p><p>The weeks lengthened into months, spring ripening into summer. The frost-bitten hush of Salem had melted into green, and life inside the cottage grew in step with it.</p><p>Nicholas’s first smile came one bright morning, the light spilling through the shutters in golden shafts. Rio was bent over him, brow furrowed, her lips moving clumsily as she tried to shape the words of the rhyme Althea had given her. Her voice was low, rough, stumbling — but Nicholas’s dark eyes followed every sound.</p><p>And then, sudden as a spell, his lips curved. A small, wobbly grin, toothless and perfect.</p><p>Rio froze, her mouth falling open. Then she let out a sound somewhere between a laugh and a growl, scooping him up against her chest. “Smile,” she whispered hoarsely, as if naming it made it real.</p><p>Agatha, watching from her chair with her knitting needles forgotten in her lap, felt her heart twist so sharply it almost hurt. She wanted to mock Rio’s astonishment, to remark on how easily a baby smiled — but the sight of wolf and child curled together stole the words from her. Instead, she only let the corners of her lips curve, her gaze soft in a way she could never quite disguise anymore.</p><p>Althea, true to her word, continued schooling Rio alongside Cora. Each afternoon, while Nicholas napped, Rio sat stiff-backed at the table, her large hands awkwardly holding chalk as Althea guided her through letters and sums.</p><p>“Again,” Althea said patiently, tapping at the slate. “N-I-C-H-O-L-A-S.”</p><p>Rio scowled at the loops and slants of her handwriting, muttering under her breath. But when Nicholas cooed from his basket nearby, Rio’s jaw set with determination. Slowly, painstakingly, she traced the name again, her dark eyes shining with pride.</p><p>“Good,” Althea said warmly. “Now read it back.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, then shaped the syllables carefully, her tongue clumsy but sure. “Nich…o…las.”</p><p>From her seat by the hearth, Agatha blinked down at her spell book, hiding the tears stinging her eyes. She had survived curses, shadows, her mother’s leash — but somehow, nothing undid her more than hearing Rio say their son’s name with such conviction.</p><p>At night, when the cottage grew still and Salem’s lanterns guttered low, Agatha’s sharp edges melted entirely. Nicholas cradled in her arms, she sang old lullabies she claimed not to remember, her voice softer than Rio had ever heard it.</p><p>Sometimes Rio would watch from the foot of the bed, silent and transfixed. Other times she would curl behind Agatha, her arms winding protectively around both witch and child, her cheek pressed to Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“You see?” Agatha would whisper down to the baby, her lips brushing Nicholas’s downy crown. “You’ve made me soft. Don’t you dare tell anyone.”</p><p>But Rio only smiled against her, her heart swelling so fiercely she thought it might split her ribs.</p><p> </p><p>The seasons rolled forward, each one leaving its mark upon Salem. The snows came and melted, the river thawed, and the hills bloomed wild with green again. Life in the cottage had steadied into rhythm — soft laughter, quiet lessons, the sweet, steady pulse of family.</p><p>Nicholas grew, his cheeks round, his eyes dark as his mother’s and wolf-bright as his other parent’s. He clutched at Agatha’s hair with fierce determination, giggled in Rio’s arms as she lifted him high, and fell asleep most nights curled between them both, as though he already understood where he belonged.</p><p>To the outside eye, he was only a child — fragile, perfect, ordinary.</p><p>But in the quiet hours, when the lanterns burned low and Salem slept, there were moments that whispered otherwise. Indigo light flickered faintly against his crib when he dreamed, the shadows bending toward him as though drawn. Sometimes his small fists curled, and the air would shift — curtains stirring though no wind crept through the shutters, the floorboards humming faintly beneath their feet.</p><p>Once, in the hush before dawn, Agatha woke to find the fire had roared to life unbidden, crackling bright though no wood had been laid. Another night, Rio stilled when she felt Nicholas’s tiny fingers curl around hers — and with that touch, her old scars stopped aching, the pain of years gone silent beneath his warmth.</p><p>There were subtler things too. Birds gathering near the window, quiet and still as though listening. The moon itself seeming to linger longer over their cottage, silver light pooling heavy on the floorboards. The earth felt different around him — quickened, alive, attentive.</p><p>Agatha would hush the flickers, cradle him close, kiss his brow as if that might ground him. Rio would watch with reverence and unease, her arms tightening around them both.</p><p>Neither spoke of it aloud. <br/>Not yet.</p><p>But in their hearts, they knew: this power — moon-born, love-forged, untouched by any chain — was more than Salem had ever seen.</p><p>And though he slept now with the peace of any child, one day Nicholas Harkness would wake fully into what he was.</p><p> </p><p>And the world would have no choice but to reckon with him.</p><p> </p>
