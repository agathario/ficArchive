<div class="userstuff">
<p>"Thanks for the incredible night, everyone.” Rio’s voice echoed through the audience as she smiled. “I hope you all enjoyed the show.”</p><p>The crowd cheered and screamed for Rio. With one last enthusiastic wave, she left the stage.</p><p>She felt euphoric, as she always did at the end of every show. As exhausting as being on tour could be, it was what she loved most. Composing songs, producing them, sharing them with the world, singing them live: Rio was made for this.</p><p>She threw herself into the comfortable armchair as soon as she reached her dressing room.</p><p>This had been the second-to-last show of the tour. The final one would take place in four days — a big closing performance in New York. She could hardly wait. After all, it was her hometown. And although she loved every city she passed through, nothing compared to the feeling of being home.</p><p>And of course, it also meant Agatha would be there.</p><p>Just the thought of seeing Agatha waiting for her after the show, with a smile on her face, made Rio feel like she was combusting.</p><p>As if, on the other side of the country, Agatha could sense what Rio was thinking, her phone lit up with Agatha’s contact on the screen.</p><p>Naturally, it was a video call, which made Rio’s smile grow even wider.</p><p>“Hey, beautiful” Rio said, squinting as she tried to figure out what was happening on the screen. She expected to see Agatha’s face, but instead, all she could see was a blur.</p><p>“Aaaaaahhhhh!” Agatha brought the phone close to her face. The scream caught Rio by surprise. “Señor Scratchy is trying to kill himself again. This is the third time this week I’ve caught him biting the lamp cord.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh. “He knows you’re the best vet in the city.”</p><p>“Well, he needs to stop, or I’m the one who’s going to need a doctor.” Agatha now held the rabbit close to her face with one hand. “So, how was the show?”</p><p>And honestly, Rio would never get used to the way Agatha’s eyes lit up and a proud smile appeared on her face when she asked that question. It didn’t matter how many shows Rio did, or how many times the same phrase was uttered—Agatha always had the same proud expression on her face as she’d had the first time Rio performed at a college festival. And of course, Agatha had been in the front row.</p><p>“It was incredible" Rio began. “I can’t believe in four days it'll be already the last show of the tour. It went by so fast.”</p><p>“I can’t believe it either. I’m a little sad I couldn’t make it to the show today." Agatha said, pouting.</p><p>“Hey, I understand. You have your own life too. But I know you’ll be there next week, and I’ll make sure it’s the best show you’ve ever seen." Rio replied with a wink.</p><p>Agatha let out a soft laugh. “What time do you arrive in New York? Scratchy’s curious.”</p><p>“Well, tell him I still have an interview tomorrow, so I should catch a flight home around 3 PM, which means I’ll get there around 6 PM. Can he hold on until then?”</p><p>Agatha let out a dramatic sigh. “It’s going to be hard. He’s so excited to see you. I doubt he’ll be able to sleep tonight.”</p><p>“Wow, man, he really needs to rest up. I don’t want him looking like a zombie when he surprises me at the airport tomorrow.” Agatha laughed again. “Don’t tell him I know about it.”</p><p>“Oh, no, of course not. Please pretend to be surprised when you see him waiting for you at the arrivals gate." Agatha whispered, still in character.</p><p>“So… what are your plans for tomorrow night?” Rio asked curiously.</p><p>“Oh, nothing special, just a friend coming over for dinner. I mean, if she’s not too tired after a long trip.”</p><p>Rio felt her chest warm. “Not when it comes to you.”</p><p>Agatha felt her cheeks heat up.</p><p>“See you tomorrow night then.” Agatha held Señor Scratchy up to the camera. “Or rather, us.”</p><p>“Counting the minutes until then." Rio replied, this time more seriously. She missed Agatha every second, and she didn’t even know if that was normal.</p><p>“We love you, Rio Vidal.” Agatha said, letting out a playful squeal like a fan at a concert, with Señor Scratchy still on camera.</p><p>“Love you two." Rio responded, laughing. “See you tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio’s smile didn’t fade after the call ended.</p><p>The truth was: Rio was in love with Agatha.<br/>
For much longer than she’d care to admit.</p><p>It was obvious to everyone around them, though they denied it.</p><p>“We’re just friends." was the answer they both always gave.</p><p>And for a while, Rio believed it.</p><p>When they first met, Rio never thought Agatha would become the most special person in her life. And today, Rio couldn’t even remember a time when Agatha hadn’t been part of her days.</p><p>But the truth was also that, no matter how often Rio insisted to everyone that they were just friends, just like Agatha did, deep down, she wanted so much more. Maybe she always had. But she was afraid. What if Agatha could never return her feelings?</p><p>No, Rio wasn’t willing to lose Agatha, so having her by her side was enough. Even if she wanted all of her.</p><p>A knock on the dressing room door pulled her out of her thoughts.</p><p>“Come in." she said.</p><p>“The car is waiting to take you back to the hotel. Tomorrow you have an interview at 11 AM, then we can grab lunch before heading straight to the airport. It’s going to be a bit rushed, but you’ll have the whole week to rest before your final show." Alice repeated the same schedule Rio had already memorized. “And, of course, you’ll be glued to Agatha until then.”</p><p>Rio laughed. She knew her friend wouldn’t miss the opportunity.</p><p>Alice had been working with Rio for two years and had also become a close friend. That was a blessing amidst the chaos of tours, music, and interviews—it was good to have someone she could trust.</p><p>And of course, Alice was one of the people who insisted that Rio and Agatha were in love with each other.</p><p>“You know me so well, Alice." Rio replied.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s not like she memorizes your showtimes and calls you five minutes after each one… Oh wait, she does.” Alice gave her a teasing look. “Honestly, you two are idiots. You write songs about love but can’t confess to a woman.”</p><p>“It’s not that simple, and you know it." Rio shot back.</p><p>“What I know is that you clearly like each other and are just wasting time. Now, let’s go. I need a hot bath.”</p><p>Rio followed her, and they left the arena together, walking in silence toward the car.</p><p>Alice’s words echoed in Rio’s mind.</p><p>Yes, she wrote songs about love, but she couldn’t be honest about her feelings for Agatha. Sometimes, it was hard even to admit them to herself, as if she were betraying Agatha’s trust.</p><p>The short drive to the hotel passed with Rio wearing her headphones, trying—at least for the ride—not to think about her situation with Agatha. If she could even call it that.</p><p> </p><p>When the car stopped at the back entrance of the hotel for Rio to get in, she wished the driver a good night and thanked him.</p><p>Accompanied by Alice and a few other team members, Rio entered the elevator.</p><p>"Alright, don't forget, interview at 11 a.m." Alice repeated for the thousandth time.</p><p>"Yes, ma'am." Rio laughed. "Good night."</p><p>"Good night, Vidal."</p><p>When she closed the door to her room, she felt the weight of the night settle on her shoulders. She needed a bath and a good night’s sleep.</p><p>While preparing the bathtub with hot water, her phone vibrated. And she knew exactly who it was.</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> Hi 🤩 Have you made it to the hotel yet?</p><p>Rio smiled at the message.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: yes!! running a bath and then off to bed</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: Glad you’ve arrived. I wanted to wish you good night.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: I know hahaha you just can’t stand not hearing from me</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: Oh, sure, what would I be without you? 😔</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: finally admitted it!!! but don’t worry, tomorrow I’ll be glued to you like a koala.</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: Speaking of being glued to me...</p><p>Agatha sent a photo. She was lying in bed with Señor Scratchy sprawled comfortably on her stomach.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: 😭😭😭 I’m so jealous!!!</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: Jealous of him or me?</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: you, of course. who wouldn’t want to cuddle with the cutest bunny in the world?</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: Sure, sure…</p><p>Agatha sent another photo. This time, it was just her face. Her blue eyes framed by thick glasses that Rio thought suited her perfectly. And Rio felt herself melt at Agatha’s smile in the picture.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: okay, maybe now I’m a little jealous of him too…</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: Don’t worry, starting tomorrow, all my smiles will be for you 💖</p><p>And once again, it was as if Agatha could read her thoughts.<br/>
Rio felt her heart skip a beat. Agatha had always been affectionate, spontaneous—it was part of who she was. But Rio couldn’t help but wonder if, maybe, it meant something more.</p><p>No.</p><p>She scolded herself immediately.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: can’t wait (also looking forward to the food)</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: I’ll make your favorite.<br/>
Good night, Rio. See you tomorrow 💖</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: night 🖤</p><p>And for what felt like the hundredth time that night, Rio let out a long sigh.</p><p> </p><p>When she got out of the bath, it felt like her exhaustion had tripled. The bed was soft and comfortable when she finally lay down.</p><p>Rio tossed and turned, trying to find the ideal position to sleep. It was ridiculous, really—she was exhausted.</p><p>There was an ache in her chest, and even though she pretended not to care, she knew exactly what it was. It wasn’t the first time.</p><p>Since her conversation with Alice, Rio’s thoughts had been echoing Agatha’s name louder and louder.</p><p>And even asleep, her mind was still invaded by Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> <strong>Flashback – Seven Years Ago</strong> </em>
</p><p>
<em>It was Rio’s first day of college, and she was excited and nervous at the same time. Everything felt real now. The campus, the classes, the new people—it was both terrifying and intoxicating.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The university was hosting a sort of mixer where freshmen could get to know each other on campus. There was music, food, and fraternity sign-ups.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio was looking at a flyer about a band while aimlessly walking when something collided directly with her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>It took her a few seconds to process what had happened.</em>
</p><p>
<em>A girl was looking at her, panicked, holding a disposable plate with what was left of what Rio thought was potato salad. Because the rest of the food was all over her shirt.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Oh my god. I’m so sorry.” The girl’s voice was loud and desperate.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Before Rio could respond, the girl began trying to clean her shirt with napkins, which only made things worse.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Well" Rio let out a laugh, seeing the girl’s desperation grow. “You definitely know how to make an entrance.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>The girl stopped trying to clean Rio’s shirt and looked her straight in the eyes, but her hands remained on Rio’s shirt.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Right on her boobs.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Sorry, I was distracted.” The desperation still lingered in her tone.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio raised an eyebrow.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“If you wanted to grab my boobs, you could’ve just asked.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio regretted the joke the moment the words left her mouth. She watched as the girl’s face turned crimson and she stepped back faster than necessary.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Sorry… Uh, I’ll just go.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>And with that, she disappeared before Rio could even introduce herself. Or ask her name.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio let out a laugh as she looked down at the mess on her shirt. Well, she needed a shower, and her shirt was going straight into the washing machine.</em>
</p><p>
<em>For the next few days, Rio looked for the girl around campus, but with no success.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Until, at the end of the first week, she found her near the library.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Hey, Miss Potato Salad.” she approached.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The girl looked at her, curious, and then her cheeks turned red again.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Oh my god. Hi.” She smiled for the first time, and Rio could swear it was the most beautiful smile she’d ever seen. “Sorry about that.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“It’s fine.” Rio said. “My shirt survived, don’t worry.” The girl smiled again. “And sorry about the boob joke. I think I went a little overboard.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>The girl looked away from Rio’s eyes for half a second.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“It’s okay, it just caught me off guard.” She extended her hand. “I’m Agatha.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Rio.” She took Agatha’s hand. “Who won’t make any more boob jokes unless you ask for them.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>And Agatha laughed, letting out a funny sound that Rio thought perfectly matched the girl she barely knew.</em>
</p><p>
<em>From that day on, there was no Rio without Agatha, and no Agatha without Rio.</em>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>When Rio left the building where the interview had been held, a car was already waiting for her.</p><p>Rio loved the life she had built. Her favorite part was definitely being able to share her music with the world. She also loved knowing that, at the end of the day, she still had the right to be just an ordinary woman.</p><p>Fame had always been something that scared her, after all, what do you lose when you become known by so many?</p><p>Relationships, individuality, privacy. These were questions that had occupied her thoughts for a long time while she invested in her career.</p><p>But Rio considered herself lucky. She had built something incredible. She believed that not all artists could say they felt respected, not only as musicians but as people. And she appreciated that more than anything.</p><p>She loved knowing that as soon as the voices at the shows faded, she was just Rio Vidal, a former music student who, by chance, did really well in the music world.</p><p>The only part Rio didn’t like much were the interviews.</p><p>Although most of the questions were always pre-selected, as there were limits interviewers had to respect, her personal life always came up. And of course, her love life.</p><p>Today was no different.</p><p>Rio always gave the same answers: she wasn’t seeing anyone at the moment. Or that she wasn’t looking for anything serious. Or that, for now, she wanted to focus on delivering the best results for her fans and focus on the end of the tour.</p><p>And that was enough, at least she thought so.</p><p>As the car headed to the restaurant where Alice and Rio were going to have lunch before heading to the airport, Rio pulled out her phone from her coat pocket and sent a message to Agatha.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: I almost didn’t survive the interview... send a picture of Señor Scratchy or I’ll die in five minutes 🕊</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: Hello, drama queen. Unfortunately, I’m not at home with Scratchy. I’m too busy saving lives, you know...</p><p>Rio smiled when she received the reply minutes later. Before she could respond, a new message came through.</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: This is Miss Nellie. Isn’t she the cutest thing you’ve ever seen?</p><p>In the photo, there was a little gray kitten. It was really cute, Rio thought.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: take me to work with you 😭😭😭</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: I know I have the best job in the world, but you have a pretty cool one too, you know, kind of rock star... not bad at all.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: yes, my job is pretty cool, but you have kittens with you. how can I compete with that?</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: You can’t, just accept defeat. 😎</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: I have to go, Miss Nellie still has some exams to do. See you later, Vidal.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: can’t wait</p><p>Rio knew she had a silly smile on her face, a smile she tried to hide when she noticed Alice’s mocking glance beside her.</p><p>“Idiots.” That’s all the woman said. Rio chose not to extend the topic. The conversation with Alice the night before had already played with her mind more than usual.</p><p>The rest of the day passed even faster than Rio imagined, which was great because the faster the day passed, the sooner she would be with Agatha.</p><p>When she finally boarded the plane, she sent one last message to Agatha.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: finally heading home!!! I’ll see you when I see you 💫</p><p>Rio didn’t get a reply before the plane took off, but that wasn’t a problem. In a few hours, she would be with Agatha, and that was all that mattered.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>As soon as the plane landed, Rio felt her chest warm up.</p><p>She couldn’t wait to finally hug Agatha.</p><p>"Let’s use the private exit, the car is already waiting for us." Alice said, which immediately surprised Rio.</p><p>Before she could protest, Alice took the lead.</p><p>"I know, I know… Agatha. I sent her a message this morning, don’t worry. She’ll be there. And it’s not like this is the first time."</p><p>Rio usually used the normal arrival exit, but on days or times when the airport was very crowded, Alice preferred the private exit.</p><p>Rio followed her.</p><p>She silently thanked that the disembarking process was quick, especially when it came to using one of the private exits. Sometimes being a celebrity had its perks, she thought.</p><p>The private exit gate wasn’t far, so it didn’t take more than a few minutes for Rio to spot her.</p><p>Agatha was standing near a fire extinguisher, distracted. Her hair was a bit messy in a ponytail, typical. She had on a white button-up shirt and dark purple pants. And to Rio, she was the most beautiful thing her eyes had ever seen.</p><p>And also, Rio couldn’t help but notice was that Agatha was holding a small but beautiful bouquet of flowers.</p><p>Agatha must have noticed her approaching because she turned her head in her direction, and soon a smile spread across her face.</p><p>Before Rio could reach her, Agatha stepped forward and hugged her. Rio immediately inhaled Agatha’s perfume, her familiar, cozy scent.</p><p>"I missed you so much," Agatha’s voice was muffled as they were still hugging.</p><p>"Not as much as I missed you," Rio replied.</p><p>When the contact ended, Agatha brought the bouquet in front of her, handing it to Rio.</p><p>"Surprise." she said.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to thank her, but was interrupted by Alice.</p><p>"Sorry to interrupt the lovebirds, but can we continue this reunion in the car?" Despite her cynical tone, she had a sweet smile on her face. "Hey Agatha, how’s it going?"</p><p>"Everything’s good, Alice. Thanks for letting me know about today." Agatha responded. Neither Agatha nor Rio commented on Alice’s remark, after all, it wasn’t a new type of comment.</p><p>"Well, I’m assuming you’re not going home, right, Rio?"</p><p>"Bingo!"</p><p>"Okay, then. Want to take any luggage?" Alice asked.</p><p>"Don’t worry, she’s going to steal some of my clothes." Agatha punched Rio’s shoulder playfully, as if teasing her.</p><p>"Okay, okay... I got it. Well, Rio, keep your phone close, I’ll update you if something comes up." The three women walked outside where cars were parked, just waiting. "And don’t do anything I wouldn’t do." Alice added, laughing.</p><p>Once again, Rio and Agatha decided to ignore her.</p><p>They got in the car and greeted the driver, who immediately set off for Agatha’s apartment.</p><p>"So..." Agatha started, a mischievous smile on her face. "How many panties were thrown at you on stage at the last show?"</p><p>"Not many this time, I think I’m losing my charm." Rio pretended to be disappointed.</p><p>Agatha leaned toward Rio’s seat, sliding her arm between Rio’s, resting her head on her shoulder. "I really missed you."</p><p>"I missed you too. You know that." Rio replied.</p><p>The rest of the ride to Agatha’s apartment consisted of small talk, with Agatha still close to Rio.</p><p>About half an hour later, when they finally arrived at the apartment, they thanked the driver and went upstairs.</p><p>"Señor Scratchyyyyyyy" Rio’s voice came out high-pitched, somewhat nasal, as she picked up the rabbit. "How’s my favorite little guy in the world?"</p><p>"Driving his mother crazy." Agatha replied.</p><p>"Did you play my role while I was gone? High five, little man." Rio flopped down on the couch with Scratchy still in her arms.</p><p>"If I didn’t know you made my favorite dish, and that you’re just waiting for me to take a shower to finish it, I feel like I could just fall asleep here, right now." Rio’s eyes were closed, and her hand was stroking Scratchy’s fur.</p><p>"Hey, none of that, straight to the shower." Agatha’s tone was playful.</p><p>"Bossy," Rio said. "Scratchy, your mom is trying to separate us. But I’ll be back soon."</p><p>"You know where my clothes are, take whatever you want." Agatha said before Rio disappeared down the hallway to the left.</p><p>And yes, she knew. It wasn’t the first time she had come from a trip and gone straight to Agatha’s place.</p><p>She grabbed a comfortable sweatpants set, some underwear (no, they didn’t think that was weird), and a towel.</p><p>Rio felt at home, after all.</p><p>She knew every room in Agatha’s apartment as well as she knew her own. And vice versa.</p><p>It didn’t take long in the shower, but the hot water did a good job of relaxing her body.</p><p>While drying her hair, now wearing Agatha’s clothes, she felt intoxicated by the lavender scent that filled the air. It was the same scent as Agatha’s, and she loved it.</p><p>When she returned to the kitchen, the table was set. The bouquet of flowers Agatha had given her was on the kitchen counter in a vase, but only one flower was on the table as part of the decoration.</p><p>"Voilá!" Agatha said, holding her hands out toward the table, as if presenting a surprise. Rio smiled at the sight.</p><p>And smiled even more when she spotted her favorite dish. Arroz con gandules, her family’s favorite recipe.</p><p>"I know I always say this, but don’t expect it to be as good as your mom’s." Agatha said as they both sat at the table.</p><p>Rio appreciated these gestures from Agatha. She had lived far from her family for so long, but Agatha made sure she always had a piece of them close by, like now.</p><p>Rio took a forkful and savored the food.</p><p>It didn’t taste exactly the same as what her mom made, but it didn’t matter, it was as if Agatha had added a special touch to something she already loved.</p><p>"This is so good," she said. "If you weren’t the best vet in the country, I’d say you should consider opening a restaurant. I’d be your number one customer."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, laughing.</p><p>"Seriously, I could write a song about this," Rio added.</p><p>"Oh my God, what an honor. My food immortalized in a song about broken hearts." Agatha dramatically placed her hand over her chest.</p><p>"Broken hearts, huh? Are you planning on breaking my heart, Miss Harkness?" Rio asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>"Depends. Does that mean it’s mine to break?" And that was when both their hearts skipped a beat. Agatha felt she had said too much, and Rio didn’t know how to respond.</p><p>Agatha broke the silence, which probably lasted no more than a few seconds.</p><p>"Well... I didn’t have time to make dessert. I’m sorry." Rio still didn’t know exactly how to react, nor did Agatha.</p><p>"No problem, we can eat donuts. No donut tastes as good as the ones from New York." Rio replied, taking another bite of the food.</p><p>And though restarting a conversation about donuts wasn’t exactly exciting, the momentary tension was dissipated, and dinner proceeded without further issue. If what happened could even be considered an issue.</p><p>However, minutes later, the tension resurfaced, and this time it was hard to hide.</p><p>While Rio and Agatha were clearing the table, laughing at some joke Rio had told, Agatha started speaking.</p><p>“You won’t believe who I ran into this week.”</p><p>“Who?” Rio sounded curious as she dried her hands with a towel next to the sink.</p><p>“Wanda.” That was all Agatha said. Rio, still with her back to her, felt her fingers tighten slightly around the towel. It took a few seconds for her to respond.</p><p>“Oh, really? How was it?” She tried to sound normal.</p><p>“I don’t know. Strange, maybe? I mean, it’s been almost three years.” There was something in Agatha’s voice that Rio couldn’t decipher, so she turned to face her, and Agatha was watching her.</p><p>“Define strange.”</p><p>“I don’t know, just… strange. She’s different. Well, I guess I am too. It was just a coincidence, but…” Agatha paused, lowering her head slightly, as if trying to calculate what to say.</p><p>“But…?” Rio encouraged her to speak.</p><p>Agatha moved through the kitchen towards the living room couch.</p><p>“She invited me to dinner this weekend.” Agatha’s voice was low.</p><p>“Oh.” Rio nodded, following her to the couch. “And did you say yes?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha answered promptly.</p><p>“Oh.” Rio repeated. A spark of happiness threatened to light up inside her, but she quickly put it out. “And why not?” She felt she should ask.</p><p>“Isn’t it weird to accept dinner with your ex-girlfriend after almost three years?”</p><p>“Well, no? Yes? Maybe?” Agatha squinted, a bit confused. “Only you can answer that question, Agatha.” Rio added.</p><p>“It doesn’t really matter. I said no, and that’s it.” Rio watched her. She felt like something was slipping away.</p><p>“Is something wrong?” She asked.</p><p>“No, nothing’s wrong. I just…” Once again, Agatha interrupted herself. She placed her fingers on her temple. Okay, definitely something was wrong.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, approaching her and touching her shoulder. “Talk to me.” There was concern in her voice.</p><p>Agatha felt her skin burn where Rio touched her, and she cursed herself for it.</p><p>“It’s nothing, really. I shouldn’t have brought it up. It doesn’t matter.” She stumbled over her words, regretting having started to talk about Wanda.</p><p>“No,” Rio replied. “Clearly, something’s wrong.”</p><p>“Forget it. I really should let it go, it’s not a big deal. And you’re tired, we don’t need to keep talking about it.” Rio’s touch still burned her skin, and Agatha tried to make Rio drop the subject, angry at herself for bringing it up in the first place.</p><p>“Come on, Agatha. Since when are we like this?” Rio insisted.</p><p>And it only took one sentence for Agatha to speak.</p><p>“It’s just that… I think I hurt her. Not now, but in the past.” She began. “I mean, I’m sure I hurt her.”</p><p>“And how exactly?” Rio was curious, after all, as far as she knew, the relationship had ended because Agatha and Wanda were, apparently, not on the same page and had different goals.</p><p>“She said I’m still afraid to be honest with how I feel.” Agatha looked away from Rio. “And that if I keep this way, I’ll never be happy.”</p><p>“What the hell? And why would she say that?” Okay, Rio was confused.</p><p>“Because I think she always knew we wouldn’t work out. Just like I always knew.” Agatha’s voice sounded like she was confessing a secret.</p><p>When her eyes caught Rio’s confused gaze again, there was an expression Rio couldn’t decipher.</p><p>Rio didn’t know if she was understanding where Agatha was going with this.</p><p>“I don’t know if I’m following, Agatha, sorry.” Agatha didn’t respond, only gave Rio a small smile, so subtle that it was hard to tell she was smiling.</p><p>Rio’s mind was a mess of questions.</p><p>For a split second, she allowed herself to think that maybe she had some role in this, which she immediately judged as selfish to think.</p><p>Before she could form her next question, Agatha kissed her.</p><p>Rio felt her body freeze.</p><p>It hadn’t been anything more than a brief touch of lips. It was quick, startled, and soon Agatha pulled away.</p><p>Her surprised eyes met Agatha’s, wide and almost panicked.</p><p>And before the sensation could fully take over, Rio didn’t think twice about pulling Agatha back towards her for a real kiss.</p><p>Rio could feel Agatha surrendering to the kiss, as if the initial hesitation evaporated around them.</p><p>What started gently soon escalated into a hungry kiss, as if all the years of waiting were being poured out right there.</p><p>Agatha’s hands went to Rio’s face as her tongue met Rio’s with even more urgency, more hunger.</p><p>Rio pulled her by her waist, bringing their bodies closer, as their lips kept moving with the same intensity.</p><p>She could feel the heat growing between them, their lips never separating. It was like they were rediscovering each other, desperately tasting one another.</p><p>Rio shuddered when Agatha bit her lip. It was as if every part of her was vibrating, the electricity between them almost tangible.</p><p>Their mouths met again, after a split second, in an even more intense kiss. Rio could feel Agatha’s heart pounding just as hard as hers.</p><p>Rio let out a moan when she felt Agatha’s hand tugging at her hair, near the nape. The sensation adding more desire.</p><p>They both burned at the same time, their tongues in a passionate duel. It wasn’t a calm kiss, it was a kiss desperate for more, much more.</p><p>When their lips finally parted, both gasped, but neither of them was ready to interrupt that moment.</p><p>It was Agatha’s turn to let out a soft moan when she felt Rio’s lips on her neck. Her body was flooded with an intense wave of pleasure, growing stronger, as her breathing became more labored.</p><p>But then something changed.</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha whispered, still a bit lost in the sensation of Rio’s lips on her skin.</p><p>Rio looked at her, her gaze full of desire, soon replaced by a wave of understanding when she realized that, by calling her name, Agatha was ending the moment.</p><p>Both of their lips were red, their bodies still burning with desire.</p><p>Rio watched her, still out of breath, searching for the right words.</p><p>“Sorry.” Agatha said.</p><p>Rio froze. Even though she didn’t know what to say, apologizing wasn’t one of the options that came to her mind.</p><p>“It shouldn’t have happened.” Agatha continued. “I’m sorry.” She said again.</p><p>“Agatha… no.” Rio’s tone was firm. She couldn’t understand how Agatha could be apologizing. How could she think she owed Rio an apology after kissing her like that?</p><p>“No, Rio. Don’t you understand?” Agatha’s eyes held something Rio couldn’t decipher again, but she felt that something had shifted at that moment. “I mean, you’re my best friend… This shouldn’t have happened. It was a mistake.”</p><p>Rio felt her heart race again.</p><p>“No.” She said. She wanted to say so much more, but the words just didn’t seem to make sense.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Agatha repeated.</p><p>A silence took over the room, which had just moments ago been filled with heat and the sounds they’d made.</p><p>“Agatha…” She placed her hand on Agatha’s leg. “Don’t say it was a mistake. You know it wasn’t.”</p><p>“How wasn’t it? We’re just friends, right? Isn’t that what we always tell everyone?” Agatha’s expression, along with the uncertainty in her voice, made it seem like she was trying to convince herself of that, not the other way around.</p><p>“Tell me you don’t think it was a mistake.” Rio felt her voice come out weaker than she expected. “Please.”</p><p>And the seconds before Agatha’s response felt like the longest seconds of Rio’s life.</p><p>“Rio… I…” Agatha seemed to be searching for answers in her own mind.</p><p>Rio pulled her hand away from Agatha’s leg.</p><p>“I think I should go.” She said.</p><p>“What?” Agatha looked genuinely surprised.</p><p>“I think… I think we need to think. You need to think.” She answered, not wanting to sound harsh or anything like that. Her head was in turmoil, just like Agatha’s.</p><p>It wasn’t fair to either of them.</p><p>“No, Rio.” Agatha reached for the woman’s hand. “It’s late, you need rest.” She was looking for excuses for Rio not to leave, but honestly, if Rio stayed, she wouldn’t know how to react.</p><p>“It’s fine, I can call an Uber.” Rio gently pulled her hand away from Agatha’s.</p><p>She stood up from the couch, reluctantly, grabbing her phone from the counter next to the flowers Agatha had given her at the airport earlier.</p><p>How had everything changed so quickly? She wondered.</p><p>“Rio…” She heard Agatha’s voice and turned to her. Agatha was still on the couch, looking so small now, scared, and Rio’s heart hurt. “We’ll be okay, right?”</p><p>Rio felt a knot in her throat.</p><p>“Of course we’ll be okay.” That was all she said before leaving Agatha’s apartment.</p><p>When she got into the elevator, her hands were shaking as she typed the address.</p><p>She wasn’t going home, at least not now.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: Alice. emergency.</p><p>It didn’t take more than a minute for the response to come.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong>: WHAT’S WRONG?</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: I’m going to your place, we’ll talk when I get there. sorry.</p><p>Rio realized she hadn’t even asked if Alice was home or if she could go there, but she was desperate and needed to talk to someone.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong>: Sure. I’ll be waiting for you.</p><p>She let out a relieved sigh, silently thanking Alice for the positive response.</p><p>When the car arrived, Rio got in, wishing the driver a good night.</p><p>She thought the driver had recognized her. Or maybe it was because of the tears she hadn’t noticed were falling from her eyes.</p><p>The truth was that they had crossed a line.</p><p>And Rio hoped that, just as she had told Agatha, they would be okay.</p>

<p>"Let me see if I got this right." Alice sat in the armchair across from the sofa where Rio was sitting. "She talked about bumping into her ex-girlfriend, said some things you didn’t quite understand, then she kissed you, pulled back, you kissed her, and then she said it was a mistake?"</p><p>Rio didn’t say a word, just nodded.</p><p>"My god, you’re more stupid than I thought."</p><p>Okay, that wasn’t quite the reaction Rio was expecting. "How is that your only conclusion?" she asked.</p><p>"Because it’s pretty obvious. It’s clear she’s afraid of ruining your friendship, which is already a pretty stupid thing, because I’ve never had a friendship like yours." Alice pointed her finger at Rio. "You guys act like a couple. And deep down, you know it, but for some reason that absolutely no one can understand, you’d rather stay in this 'will they, won’t they' forever." She fumed.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to protest, but Alice continued.</p><p>"Shh, listen to me." She interrupted. "I want to know what’s going on in your minds. I mean, how long are you planning to stay like this? Neither of you is going to have a relationship? Because you clearly have no intention of getting involved with anyone, at least not for real. And Agatha? It’s pretty easy to understand why she hasn’t had a girlfriend since Wanda."</p><p>"You're done?" Rio asked.</p><p>"For now, yes."</p><p>"You make everything seem so easy, Alice." A tired sigh escaped her.</p><p>"You’re the ones complicating something that shouldn’t be complicated. Damn, you’ve been friends for years, you know each other better than anyone, the good and the bad parts. What more could you want?"</p><p>And Rio didn’t know how to respond. She stared at Alice, her eyes heavy with exhaustion and the tears from earlier.</p><p>Alice noticed her words had hit a nerve, so she softened her tone. "You said she needed time to think, and well, you do too. I know you’ll work it out, so I hope you’re not stressing about it."</p><p>Again, Rio thought Alice made everything seem so easy, but this time she kept the thought to herself.</p><p>She let out a yawn, showing her exhaustion, which seemed to be Alice’s cue to change the subject.</p><p>"You can sleep here, I don’t want you in a car alone late at night. We can talk more tomorrow morning." Rio nodded again, grateful to Alice.</p><p>The woman then led her to the guest room, handing her a new toothbrush.</p><p>"I can lend you something to sleep in," Alice suggested.</p><p>And though it was a bit awkward to say out loud, Rio refused. Despite everything, the scent of Agatha on the clothes would make her feel better (or not).</p><p>Alice let out a small laugh.</p><p>"Goodnight, Rio."</p><p>"Goodnight, Alice."</p><p>And then, for the first time since the kiss, she was completely and utterly alone.</p><p>Despite all the exhaustion from the trip and especially from the past few hours, Rio knew she wouldn’t be able to close her eyes.</p><p>Yeah, it would be a long night.</p><p>And amid conflicting feelings, in the company of only her broken heart, Rio began to do what she did best, after all, it was the only way she could express everything she was feeling at that moment.</p><p>She would write a fucking song.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>Two days had passed since they kissed, and that meant Rio’s final show of the tour was tomorrow.</p><p>And the state of their relationship was anything but normal.</p><p>To say they hadn’t spoken would be a lie. Agatha had sent a message to Rio the morning before.</p><p>Rio could sense that Agatha was treading carefully, as if she was hesitant. And well, Rio didn’t know how to act either.</p><p>It took her hours to finally reply to the message. There was no excitement from either side, just an acknowledgment that, despite everything, the other was still there. Somehow.</p><p>She stared at the messages from the day before.</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: Hey, Rio. How are you?<br/>I’ve rewritten this message dozens of times... I’m not sure what to say. We’ll be okay, right?</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: I’m fine. And you?<br/>Don’t worry, we’ll be fine. I’ve told you this before.</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: 💖</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: 🖤</p><p>She took a deep breath, wondering whether or not to send a new message.</p><p>Rio knew things weren’t truly okay. The kiss meant so much to her, and she hoped it did for Agatha as well. But with each passing hour, her fears grew louder.</p><p>Did the line they crossed mean their friendship would never be the same? Rio didn’t know how to deal with this, and the absence of an true conversation only made it worse.</p><p>They had never been like this, she thought. But the answer came to her immediately. They had never kissed before either.</p><p>She knew they’d talk at some point, but the waiting was torturous. She had so much to say, and for so long.</p><p>So, she decided she would send the message.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: Are you going to the show tomorrow?</p><p>The doubt hammered in her mind constantly. She wanted to believe Agatha would go, wanted to believe that, as she told the woman, they would be okay.</p><p>Agatha’s reply took only a few minutes.</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: You know I wouldn’t miss it for anything in the world.</p><p>Rio felt a sudden relief. Deep down, she knew Agatha would be there, but getting the confirmation was like a balm for her soul.</p><p>She didn’t reply to the message, knowing they’d talk sooner or later, though the distance was eating away at her. She had never gone this long without talking to Agatha since they met, or exchanged only half-hearted words.</p><p>It was strange. It was wrong. It was suffocating. And Rio couldn’t stop thinking about the kiss, but soon Agatha’s words would cloud her thoughts, ending the moment.</p><p>She wanted to make Agatha change her mind, to say it wasn’t a mistake, that everything was okay and that this was meant to happen. And then, seconds later, she mentally cursed herself for thinking that way. It wasn’t her place to think about what Agatha should or shouldn’t feel or say.</p><p>But Rio felt so much. And had for so long.</p><p>She remembered the first time she wanted to kiss Agatha, and how it scared her.</p><p>It was in the middle of summer vacation, during their second year of college, and Rio was spending the week at Agatha’s family house.</p><p>Agatha had always been in the habit of swimming at night in the large Harkness family pool, and that week, Rio had accompanied her every night.</p><p>It was on the fourth night, when the rest of the house was asleep except for the two of them, that Rio felt her heart race for the first time at the thought of kissing Agatha.</p><p>It wasn’t that Rio had never kissed a friend before, especially at the end of high school. But the idea of kissing Agatha was different.</p><p>If Rio closed her eyes, she could almost smell the chlorine from the pool.</p><p align="center">
<strong>FLASHBACK - 6 YEARS AGO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha pushed herself up with her hands, forcing her body to sit on the edge of the pool, where Rio had been for a few minutes.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Tired?" she asked.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"No, just thinking." Rio lifted her head, gazing at the moon. Something was bothering her that night, though she didn’t quite know what it was yet.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"You’ve been a bit quiet today." Agatha continued, watching her friend.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Missing home, I guess." Maybe that was it, Rio thought. It wasn’t a lie, after all. She did miss her big, loud family, the bustling home.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha nodded before speaking again.</em>
<br/>
<em>"Have you ever stopped to think about how life changes so quickly that sometimes we don’t even realize what’s happening?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Yes." The discomfort in Rio's chest surfaced once more.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"One day, you’re living your life thinking it’s just a normal day, and suddenly, something happens. Sometimes, you don’t even realize it’s something that will change everything." Agatha continued.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Like, for example, bumping into a beautiful woman and spilling potato salad all over her?" Rio suggested. And there it was: Agatha’s laughter. She let out a little grunt as she laughed, and Rio loved that.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Yes." Agatha said, still laughing. "Definitely."</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio let out a quiet laugh, trying to understand that persistent feeling that seemed unwilling to leave her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Have you ever stopped to ask yourself if you’re letting something slip by?" Rio wasn’t sure if the question was for Agatha or for herself. And she feared the answer.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I think everyone feels that way, don’t they? It’s almost inevitable." Agatha seemed like she wanted to say something more, but she just shook her head, as if confirming what she had just said.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio didn’t continue the conversation, letting Agatha’s answer close the subject.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The silence was comfortable, like a hug. Their company was enough, words didn’t need to be present all the time.</em>
</p><p>
<em>A few minutes later, Agatha leaned back into the pool.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"One last dive before heading in." She said, extending her hand. "Join me?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio reached back and took her hand, joining her in the water, feeling a rush of warmth course through her body, despite being in the pool.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I’m not ready to go back to college," Agatha’s voice was playful. "I could stay here forever, waking up late and swimming every night. Just you and me." And Rio threw a smile in Agatha’s direction before diving in again.</em>
</p><p>
<em>That was when the realization hit Rio.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I want to kiss her." Her thoughts echoed loud, as loud as the beat of her heart.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Maybe it was then that Rio knew it wasn’t just a fleeting feeling, that the discomfort in her chest had been there longer than she would’ve liked to admit, even though she only felt the truth hit her in that moment.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She sank into the water, her heart confused, but with one certainty in mind: she wouldn’t do anything about it.</em>
</p><p><br/>The memory was fresh in Rio’s mind. Years had passed, but now she felt like that same girl, pathetically in love with her best friend.</p><p>But this time, she would do something. She wasn’t going to swallow her words again. She deserved to speak up, and Agatha needed to know.</p><p>The song was ready. It was like one of those moments when all an artist needs is a few minutes to create something. The words came easily, overflowing from within her after years of being locked away.</p><p>It would be just her and her guitar.</p><p>And despite all the nervousness and the constant agitation in her chest, she could barely wait.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>Rio was freaking out.</p><p>"You’re going to make a hole in the floor from pacing back and forth." She considered that Alice might be right.</p><p>Yesterday, the idea of singing the song she’d written after the kiss seemed like the right thing to do. Today? She wasn’t so sure anymore.</p><p>She still wanted to sing it, of course, but she was so scared.</p><p>What if Agatha got mad? What if she thought Rio was trying to turn what happened into some kind of success? Or that Rio had written the song to make her feel guilty somehow?</p><p>"Hey," Alice’s voice cut through again. "Whatever you’re thinking, forget it. Don’t fill your head with things you know that aren’t true." Alice’s comment was enough to make Rio realize she probably looked desperate. Great.</p><p>"But what if she..."</p><p>"Rio, shut up." Alice interrupted. "You called me in the middle of the night saying you were going to include a song at the end of the show, and didn’t even want to show me the song. You said no one could hear it before Agatha. You respect her, and you know it. Don’t start tricking yourself into thinking this song is going to hurt her. I trust you. And she does too, you know that."</p><p>"I’m so confused."</p><p>"Think positive. At least at the end of the show, you’ll talk. Things will get fixed. You haven’t lost her, Rio." She felt such a deep gratitude for Alice in that moment that she pulled her into a hug.</p><p>Alice widened her eyes, caught off guard.</p><p>"Thank you," Rio murmured.</p><p>"And when all this is over, I’ll need therapy for dealing with both of you." Rio knew Alice was trying to lighten the mood, though she sensed there was some truth to it. "Now get ready, you go on in 10 minutes."</p><p>Rio sighed. There was no turning back, and she hoped she could fix everything. She needed to make it work. She had to give the audience a great show, her best. She needed Agatha to understand what she felt, and above all, she needed to rid herself of the anguish of holding something inside for so long.</p><p>She checked her phone before going on stage. There were messages from her family, as always before every show. And one message from Agatha.</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: Good show, my rock star. I’m here. Always.</p><p>With one last sigh, she went to her mark, the final adjustments being made. Seconds later, she felt that energy take over her.</p><p>She would do this for all the people who were there to support her.</p><p>She would do this for Agatha.</p><p>She would do this for herself.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>"Okay, everyone," she began. This was it. Finally. "I have a surprise for this final night. First of all, I want to thank each and every one of you who is here tonight, each one who’s been with me at other shows, each one who listens to my music and let me be myself. There is nothing I value more than knowing my words touch your hearts." She adjusted the microphone in front of her before continuing. One of her band members handed her the guitar. "I wrote something that I hope will reach someone's heart. This is me in every word, in every verse."</p><p>She began to strum the melody of the song, feeling a whirlwind of emotions all at once. She was really doing this.</p><p>
<em>Here we go again, everything is fine</em>
<br/>
<em>I guess we could pretend, we didn't cross a line</em>
</p><p>She closed her eyes, feeling the music.</p><p>
<em>But ever since that day, everything has changed</em>
<br/>
<em>The way I write your name,</em>
<br/>
<em>the cursive letter A</em>
</p><p>Still with her eyes closed, she saw Agatha's face in her mind.</p><p>
<em>[...]</em>
</p><p>
<em>Whatever you decide</em>
<br/>
<em>I will understand</em>
<br/>
<em>And it will all be fine</em>
<br/>
<em>Just go back to being friends</em>
</p><p>The word "friends" came out stronger than she had planned as she reached the chorus.</p><p>
<em>And love is a kaleidoscope</em>
<br/>
<em>How it works we'll never know</em>
<br/>
<em>And even all the change</em>
<br/>
<em>Is somehow all the same</em>
</p><p>Rio was surprised to feel that as the song progressed, the more calm she became.</p><p>
<em>[...]</em>
</p><p>
<em>And if you ever find</em>
<br/>
<em>Someone who could write</em>
<br/>
<em>A better song for you</em>
<br/>
<em>Well I'd love to see them try</em>
</p><p>She had only played this song for herself, but in that moment, it felt as if she had been playing it her whole life. The words so familiar to her heart, the chords so perfect.</p><p>Her pitch rose as the song neared its end.</p><p>
<em>[...]</em>
</p><p>
<em>Every color of the rainbow</em>
<br/>
<em>Don't be afraid to hold it close</em>
<br/>
<em>It's never just a shape alone</em>
<br/>
<em>Love is a kaleidoscope</em>
</p><p>She opened her eyes, feeling a single tear slip down her face, while surprisingly a smile appeared. Not because of the applause, although that made her happy too. The smile was a realization that she had been brave enough to let it all out.</p><p>And since that night, it was the first time her chest felt relieved.</p><p>"Thank you," she said. "I was unsure if it was the right thing to do, I mean, singing this song tonight. And I can say now that yes, it was the right thing to do."</p><p>More applause and enthusiastic cheers surrounded her.</p><p>"Please, make some noise for this band and the whole amazing team that made every show possible." The crowd went wild once again. "Thank you to each and every one of you. You all deserve to be celebrated."</p><p>Rio stood in the middle of the stage, with her band by her side, and with one last wave, she left the stage with the certainty that she was ready for whatever came next.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>It had been less than teen minutes since Rio had entered her dressing room. She was drinking a bottle of water, replaying in her mind everything that had just happened.</p><p>When she heard a knock on the door, she thought it was Alice, as usual.</p><p>"Come in." And then Rio saw her.</p><p>Agatha was standing there, in front of the door. Her eyes red, her nose slightly swollen. She had definitely been crying. Her face was a mix of confusion and uncertainty.</p><p>"Hi." Her voice was nothing but a whisper.</p><p>"Hi." Rio repeated. Her heart began to race, just as it had so many times before.</p><p>"You kept your promise." Agatha said. Now it was Rio's turn to express confusion.</p><p>"What do you mean by that?"</p><p>"You told me this would be the best show I could see." Agatha stepped closer to her. "And you kept your promise."</p><p>"So..." Rio didn’t know how to start. "What did you think of the song?"</p><p>Agatha stepped closer. "Everything you said in that song... is that how you really feel?"</p><p>"I’ve never been as honest as I was tonight." This time, Rio took a step toward Agatha.</p><p>"Then you meant it." Agatha seemed to be reaffirming it to herself. Rio nodded. "I need to apologize for that night." She continued.</p><p>"No." Rio interrupted. "No, Agatha, none of that, you don’t—"</p><p>"Rio." Agatha closed the remaining distance between them. "I need to apologize for saying that it was a mistake. How could it have been a mistake?" Agatha’s eyes, once swollen, were now overflowing with small tears. "We've been dancing around the truth for so long... but I don't want to do that anymore.<em> I don’t want to pretend we didn’t cross a line."</em></p><p>Agatha took Rio’s hand in hers, while her eyes locked with the woman in front of her. "I don't want to hide how I feel anymore, Rio."</p><p>"Then tell me." Rio's tone was pleading. "Tell me how you feel. Because you already know how I feel."</p><p>"I’m crazy about you, Rio." Agatha's words hit Rio hard. It was almost as if the world around them had disappeared. "I’m completely in love with you. I've loved you for longer than I’m willing to admit. But I was always so scared to let myself feel that, that I did what I did, and hurt you."</p><p>Rio felt a lump in her throat. Agatha loved her. She really loved her.</p><p>"I can’t lose you, Rio." There was so much vulnerability in Agatha that Rio didn’t hesitate to pull her into an embrace.</p><p>She had so much to say, but in that moment, the only thing she needed was to feel Agatha’s body against hers. Their hearts were beating wildly, and it was possible to feel it in the embrace. And although they had hugged countless times before, none had ever felt as intimate as this one. There was something different, in a good way. Rio felt Agatha's hands holding her tightly and gently at the same time.</p><p>Even though Rio wanted to stay in Agatha’s arms, Agatha broke the embrace, while placing her hands on Rio’s face, gently caressing her.</p><p>"It’s always been you, Rio." She spoke again. "I think I’ve always known that, even when it wasn’t clear, some part of me already knew. That’s why Wanda told me I wasn’t being honest with myself, because she knew too. You’re the only one for me."</p><p>If someone had told Rio, four days ago, that she would be hearing these words from Agatha, she would have laughed. Not even in her wildest dreams she could've seen this moment coming.</p><p>"I was so afraid of losing you." Rio felt it was her turn to speak. Her hands met Agatha’s wrists, which were still caressing her face. Rio felt like she could melt in her touch.</p><p>"You’ll never lose me, Rio. No matter what happens, the choices we make, what the future holds... We will always have each other, and nothing will ever change that."</p><p>"I tried to convince myself I didn’t feel any of this." Rio spoke again. "I don’t know how I was able to do that. I’ve loved you for so long, Agatha. I can’t remember who I was before you, I don’t know how it was to love before I loved you. You’re my fucking heart, Agatha."</p><p>Rio pressed their foreheads together, their breaths mixing from the closeness. Their hearts still beating in unison.</p><p>"Rio?" Agatha called. Rio pulled back just enough to look directly into her eyes. "I really want to kiss you now. No backing away this time."</p><p>"Please, do it." She almost begged.</p><p>So when Rio felt Agatha’s lips against hers again, everything made sense.</p><p>Agatha’s hands moved to Rio’s neck, and Rio responded by pulling her even closer.</p><p>The kiss solidified all the words that had been spoken between them in that moment.</p><p>This time, the kiss wasn’t as hungry as the first. Of course, the desire was there, palpable, but the previous urgency gave way to a conscious surrender, knowing that neither of them was going anywhere.</p><p>Their tongues met more slowly this time, savoring each other’s taste. There was no rush, not in that moment. That kiss was the synthesis of everything. There was no more fear, no more doubt.</p><p>When they pulled apart, with their breaths somewhat staggered, they smiled. Finally, together.</p><p>"Let’s get out of here." Agatha’s words, so different from those spoken that night.</p><p>Knowing the night had only just begun, they left hand in hand, eager for the next touch. The next kiss. For everything.</p><p>And finally at peace. They had finally stopped dancing around that feeling.</p><p>Now, they danced together.</p>

<p>The door to Rio’s apartment barely clicked shut before Agatha pushed her against it, her lips finding Rio’s in a kiss that was hungry, unrestrained, and desperate. Rio responded immediately, her hands gripping Agatha’s waist as she pulled her closer, their bodies pressing together like they couldn’t bear to be apart for even a second.</p><p>“I've wanted this for so long.” Agatha's voice was a mixture of urgency and desire.</p><p>“Me too,” Rio managed to reply, her voice low and hoarse. She captured Agatha’s lips again, their kisses deepening, turning messy. </p><p>They stumbled together, never breaking contact. Agatha’s hands roamed over Rio’s back, while Rio’s fingers slid under Agatha’s shirt, finding the warm skin beneath. In their haste, they knocked into a side table, the lamp wobbling dangerously before clattering to the floor. </p><p>“Sorry about that.” Agatha murmured against Rio’s lips, her tone teasing, though her hands betrayed her impatience as they tugged at the hem of Rio's shirt.</p><p>Rio laughed. “You can break everything in this place if you want, just don’t stop kissing me.”</p><p>Agatha kissed Rio again. Their tongues now met with more desire, more hunger, as their bodies burned with longing for more.</p><p>“Bedroom.” It was the only thing Rio managed to say.</p><p>She began to lead Agatha down the corridor, their bodies never really letting go. Agatha pulled her back before they even reached the door, pressing her against the wall, her lips finding Rio's neck, leaving a trail of heated kisses that made Rio's knees weak.</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio let out a groan. “You're killing me here.”</p><p>“Good.” Agatha sucked on the skin of Rio's neck in response. That would definitely leave a mark.</p><p>When they finally reached the bedroom, Rio sat down, bringing Agatha with her. Agatha straddled her lap, her hands sliding up Rio's back, under her shirt, her touch igniting a fire wherever it lingered.</p><p>Agatha put her hands on the hem of Rio's shirt, pulling it up. </p><p>Oh. Rio wasn't wearing a fucking bra. <br/>Agatha felt her mouth salivate at the image.</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio's voice came out hoarse. "I need you. Now."</p><p>It was the cue Agatha needed to push Rio onto the bed, now with her body completely on top of hers. </p><p>When she tried to take off her own shirt, Rio grabbed her hand.</p><p>“Let me.” She pulled off Agatha's shirt, then set about ripping off her bra as well. </p><p>The sight of Agatha on top of her, disheveled, her lips red from kissing...<br/>She looked like a fucking goddess. And Rio wanted nothing more than to worship her. </p><p>Rio touched her, feeling Agatha's nipples harden, her skin soft.</p><p>“Let me touch you first.” Agatha's voice interrupted the act, and Rio thought she might explode.</p><p>There was something in her voice, in the way those words came out, that made Rio realize how much Agatha wanted to be in control at that moment.</p><p>Agatha hurried to remove Rio's pants. “Your ass looks great in those pants, you know that?” she joked. Rio let out a laugh. </p><p>Now only a layer of clothing separated Rio from Agatha's touch.</p><p>“You're so beautiful.” Rio's breath hitched as Agatha's hands touched her body with devotion. </p><p>Agatha leaned down and planted a kiss on Rio's neck. Rio grabbed Agatha's ass, a little dissatisfied that Agatha's pants were still on her body.</p><p>“You know...” She started to say, still intoxicated by Agatha's kisses on her skin. “It's not fair that you're still wearing so many clothes.”</p><p>“You're right,” Agatha said, her voice low and husky. She smiled, her eyes twinkling mischievously. “We really should get rid of this.”</p><p>Agatha unbuttoned her pants, while Rio's hands pulled down the garment. Agatha was still on top of Rio, which made the woman's attempt to remove it, somewhat uncoordinated, eliciting a laugh from both of them. </p><p>“That's better.” Rio said as Agatha moved her body back on top of her, now free.</p><p>Agatha kissed her again, this time more eagerly. Their bodies were burning with desire, longing for the next touch, for more.</p><p>Agatha moved her hips against Rio's, eliciting a moan from the woman between kisses. Their tongues were desperate, no longer as delicate as before. </p><p>Agatha lowered her kisses to Rio's neck again, each time putting more pressure on it, marking the spot.</p><p>It was when Agatha's lips touched her nipple that Rio thought she was really going to combust. And they had only just begun.</p><p>Agatha kept her hands on the woman's body while her tongue played with Rio's nipple.</p><p>She moved down a little further, now leaving traces of kisses down Rio's belly. </p><p>“Agatha” Rio's voice contained a desperation that sounded delicious to Agatha's ears. Both were burning with desire for what was to come next.</p><p>Agatha continued kissing, now moving her mouth down to the hem of Rio's underwear. </p><p>Rio felt her whole body electrified. She was about to call Agatha's name again when she felt another kiss, this time on her left thigh. A new gasp escaped her lips.</p><p>“I really want to taste you.” Agatha said.<br/>And before Rio could reply, Agatha hurried to remove her underwear.</p><p>Agatha gazed at the image of Rio, now totally naked in front of her. She could feel her own wetness, and her mouth salivated at the sight of Rio with her legs spread. </p><p>Rio was now her private meal and she wouldn't waste another second. She moved closer again, leaving one last kiss between Rio's thighs. </p><p>Rio's breathing was racing, and when she felt Agatha's kiss on her thigh, now with no barrier of clothing separating Agatha's mouth from her intimacy, she couldn't help but let out a moan. </p><p>She exchanged a glance with Agatha, who was between her legs, and she swore she had never seen anything sexier than that before. </p><p>Rio wasn't a religious woman, but when Agatha's tongue touched her for the first time, she believed that some higher being existed.</p><p>Agatha licked her again, savoring Rio's taste. Her tongue finding the right rhythm as it explored Rio's wetness.</p><p>She sucked Rio's clit, soon feeling Rio's hand in her hair. Rio held on tight, moving her hips into Agatha's mouth, who again sucked on her clit.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha,” Rio moaned loudly as she felt Agatha's tongue moving deliciously. “Please, don't stop.”</p><p>The growing desperation in Rio's voice was all the fuel Agatha needed to keep going. She gripped Rio's thighs tighter, putting more pressure on her tongue as her mouth continued to devour the woman.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck” Rio moved her hips into Agatha's mouth again, who let out a moan against her clit. “I'm so close.” </p><p>Agatha didn't stop. Rio's increasingly loud and desperate moans indicated her approaching orgasm, and Agatha continued to use her tongue.</p><p>“Shit, Agatha” Rio arched her back as she reached orgasm, uttering Agatha's name one more time in the midst of the peak of her pleasure wave. </p><p>She came in Agatha's mouth. And that was so fucking hot.</p><p>“Jesus fucking christ.” Her voice now sounded a little slurred, her body electrified with pleasure. </p><p>“You taste so good.” Agatha lay on top of Rio once more. Rio could see her wetness on Agatha's mouth and chin, and damn, she really wanted to taste it. Straight from Agatha's mouth.</p><p>Rio pulled Agatha's face to her, kissing her fiercely, feeling her taste on her tongue. </p><p>The kiss was intense, still desperate. The sounds they made, Rio thought, might make her come again. </p><p>But they weren't finished yet. </p><p>“Now it's my turn to feel you.” Rio said, breaking the kiss. She could see the desire in Agatha's eyes, so she quickly reversed their positions.</p><p>Rio kissed her again. She could still taste herself on Agatha's tongue.</p><p>Their bodies intertwined as the kiss continued, the sounds that escaped from both of them only increasing the desire that pulsed between Agatha's legs.</p><p>"Rio..." Agatha said, breaking the kiss. "Please, I need you." Now it was her voice that contained desperation. The desire to feel Rio was overwhelming, and she couldn't wait any longer. </p><p>Rio's hands caressed Agatha's breasts, while she watched the woman close her eyes, enjoying the sensation.</p><p>"You're so fucking hot. I want to make you mine. Completely." Rio reached down, removing Agatha's underwear. "God, you're so fucking wet."</p><p>"Please, I need you. Now, Rio, please." And that was enough for Rio. </p><p>Rio placed herself between Agatha's legs, licking her once. Agatha let out a moan as she felt Rio's tongue on her.</p><p>Before Agatha could think, she felt Rio putting a finger inside her while her tongue sucked her clit.</p><p>"Oh, god." She arched her back, this time moaning louder. "More." Rio inserted another finger, this time going deeper into Agatha.</p><p>“Rio, don't stop.” Rio increased the speed of her fingers, filling Agatha. Agatha moaned loudly as Rio continued at the same frequency.</p><p>“Oh my god.” Agatha moaned, not caring about anything else. “I'm so close.”</p><p>Rio turned her attention to Agatha's clit, sucking it again as her fingers continued to drive Agatha crazy.</p><p>Agatha reached orgasm screaming Rio's name, and she could have sworn she had never heard her name pronounced as beautifully as it was now. </p><p>Their breathing was fast, and they remained like that, in the same position, with Rio still inside Agatha, while they tried to catch their breath again.</p><p>“You look so beautiful after you've come.” It was Rio who broke the silence. Agatha let out a gasp as Rio pulled her fingers out of her. Agatha laughed, still enraptured by the moment.</p><p>Rio left a kiss on the tip of Agatha's nose. “I love your nose, you know that?” </p><p>Agatha turned fully towards Rio now, running her hand down her back, bringing her body closer. In response, she brought their noses together, rubbing the tips gently, lovingly, while a simple smile lit up her face.</p><p>“I love you.” She said.</p><p>“And I love you.” Rio replied, stroking her cheek. “My Agatha.” </p><p>At that moment, everything made sense. They were exactly where they had always wanted to be. They belonged, now completely, to each other.</p><p>They stayed like that for a while, their bodies glued together, just enjoying this new closeness they had just discovered and which already seemed so normal, so right. Just feeling each other.</p><p>Until Agatha's laughter caught Rio's attention.</p><p>“What?” she asked, curious.</p><p>“You know that image where there's a guy in front of, like, hundreds of people who are all saying the same thing and he says something like, ‘No, you're all wrong’?”</p><p>Rio watched her, somewhat confused, while Agatha had an amused look on her face.</p><p>“I have no idea what you're talking about.” It was her turn to laugh. “But go on.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, laughing. "I was going to say it's us. The guy, in fact. While everyone around us said we were in love with each other, we kept insisting that we weren't."</p><p>This time, Rio really laughed. “Yeah, that does sound like us.”</p><p>Agatha stroked Rio's shoulder, before continuing to speak.</p><p>“Isn't it a bit frustrating for you?” She asked.</p><p>"What do you mean? That it took us a while to admit how we felt?"</p><p>Agatha nodded. "We wasted so much time."</p><p>Rio touched her face. Of course, she had thought about it too, but it wasn't as if it changed what they had now. </p><p>"Hey" She lifted Agatha's chin sweetly, making their eyes meet. "None of that matters anymore. What matters is here, now. It's not like we didn't have each other before. And it doesn't matter how long we spent pretending that what we felt wasn't real, because that time doesn't even compare to how much time we have ahead of us."</p><p>Agatha's eyes sparkled as her heart exploded with Rio's every word. </p><p>"An entire lifetime?" Agatha kissed Rio's hand, which was resting gently on her cheek.</p><p>"An entire lifetime" Rio confirmed. She moved closer, leaving a simple kiss on Agatha's lips. </p><p>"So..." Agatha's hopeful gaze met Rio's once again. "What happens now?"</p><p>And with the certainty that nothing else mattered, because now they were together, as it should be, Rio answered Agatha's question.</p><p>"Everything that happens next."</p>
