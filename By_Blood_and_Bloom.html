<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Rio Vidal has had a bad couple of months. Her girlfriend of four years cheated on her and then promptly left her for some young thing, and her creative juices seem to have dried up completely. She has to deliver something to her publisher in the next six months, but inspiration has completely deserted her, just like stupid Carol.</p><p>Then she receives a letter. And an inheritance from a grandmother she never even knew existed. In fucking Maine. But hey, her life already sucks, so maybe a trip to middle of nowhere Thistle Grove, Maine is exactly what she needs?</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>There is this account on Instagram called Tiny Houses Perfect that I absolutely love. The idea for this story came to me after I saw one of the posts there and the house featured looked so good, like it had come straight out of a witchy story. I just kept thinking about it and an idea popped up.

      Chapter 1: One

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>The envelope didn’t belong.</p><p>Rio Vidal spotted it immediately, wedged between a crumpled electric bill and a glossy pizza flyer that still had grease on the edges. It was heavy, thick with something more than paper. Cream-colored. Sealed in wax. Her name written across the front in looping, deliberate script: Rio M. Vidal.</p><p>No return address. No stamp.</p><p>She frowned. Her life didn’t include mystery letters. Lately, it barely included anything at all.</p><p>The apartment was a disaster. Empty coffee cups. A sketchpad on the couch, open to a blank page she’d stared at for two straight hours. An open Word doc titled Something With Meaning blinking with zero words typed. She was on month three of the worst creative drought of her life, and if one more well-meaning fan asked on Instagram when the next volume of Wolf &amp; Violet was coming out, she might scream.</p><p>And of course, there was Carol.</p><p>Carol, who had not only cheated on her with some twenty-two-year-old barista with a half-shaved head and a septum ring, but had done it in their apartment. <em> In their bed. </em> Carol, who packed up her side of the closet and left a sticky note that read “You’re brilliant, Rio. Just not… enough for me.”</p><p>Rio cracked the wax seal with her thumbnail and unfolded the letter, heart pounding with something halfway between dread and numb curiosity.</p><p>
<em> To Miss Rio Vidal, </em>
</p><p>
<em> I write on behalf of the estate of Eliza Vidal, your grandmother. Per the terms of her will, you are named as the sole heir to her property in Thistle Grove, Maine. Enclosed is the deed to the cottage, located at the edge of the woods near the old well. While the home has remained unoccupied for some time, it is yours, should you choose to claim it. </em>
</p><p>
<em> We trust you’ll know what to do. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Warmly, </em>
</p><p>
<em> Adelaide Morrissey, Executor of the Vidal Estate </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Grandmother,” Rio said flatly.</p><p>She didn’t have one. Or at least, she hadn’t thought she did. No family, not really. She’d grown up bouncing from foster homes to group homes, the name Vidal clinging to her like a stray label no one bothered to peel off. She’d always thought her last name had just been something a tired social worker had randomly chosen for her as an abandoned baby.</p><p>She’d never heard of Thistle Grove, let alone an Eliza Vidal.</p><p>She read the letter again, slower this time. The words should you choose to claim it echoed in her head like a dare.</p><p>She was still staring at it when her phone buzzed.</p><p>Alice Wu lit up on the screen.</p><p>Rio answered. “Hey.”</p><p>“You sound weirder than usual. What’s going on?”</p><p>Rio let out a short laugh. “I got a letter.”</p><p>“Ominous. From?”</p><p>“Apparently… my dead grandmother. Who left me a cottage. In Maine.”</p><p>A beat. “You don’t have a grandmother.”</p><p>“That’s what I thought.”</p><p>“You’ve got to be kidding me.”</p><p>“I’m not. I’m holding the deed in my hands right now. And the keys to it. It says Thistle Grove, which sounds like a place where people disappear into the woods and reemerge twenty years later with antlers and riddles.”</p><p>“Oh, absolutely haunted. I’m picturing cobwebs and taxidermy. Are you going?”</p><p>“I think so. I mean, there’s nothing keeping me here. I’ve got nothing holding me here. No relationship. No working plot. And I’m starting to think the apartment is haunted by Carol’s ghost, or worse—her taste in music.”</p><p>Alice sighed. “Okay, first of all, never speak of Carol’s playlist again. Second of all, if you go and get murdered in the woods by a cult, I will come resurrect you just to slap you. And third… yeah. Maybe you should go.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“You’ve been drowning, Rio. Maybe this is weird. But maybe weird is exactly what you need?”</p><p>That landed.</p><p>“Yeah…” Rio nodded to herself, eyes on the envelope again. “Yeah, okay. I’ll get my stuff together and buy a plane ticket, I guess. I’ll text you when I get there.”</p><p>“You’d better. And send pictures. If it turns out there’s some sexy lumberjack or haunted librarian involved, I want all the details.”</p><p>Rio smiled for the first time in what felt like weeks. “Deal.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>Portland smelled like salt and rain.</p><p>Rio wheeled her suitcase through the rental lot, the sea wind knotting her dark hair into something wild. She tossed her bag into the backseat of a compact gray SUV and unfolded the printed directions Alice had insisted she bring—“Phones die, especially in murder towns.”</p><p>The drive from Portland to Thistle Grove took her off the interstate and deep into the pine-stretched wilderness of inland Maine. The roads narrowed, the GPS signal grew patchy, and mist began to settle low along the treetops like it had been waiting for her.</p><p>She passed through one blinking stoplight town after another. Gas stations with signs for maple candy. Antique shops closed for the season. An ice cream stand shaped like a giant wooden cone, boarded up for winter.</p><p>And finally—after miles of nothing but forest and gray sky—a crooked wooden sign appeared by the roadside, partially swallowed by moss:</p><p>
<em> Welcome to Thistle Grove. Population: 1,268 </em>
</p><p>She took a slow breath, rolled down the window, and let the pine-heavy air wash over her.</p><p>The trees felt closer here.</p><p>Like they were watching.</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Thistle Grove looked like it had been forgotten by time—and liked it that way.</p><p>The main road curved gently into town, lined with crooked brick buildings and hand-painted signs. A hardware store with a porch swing out front. A diner with lace curtains and a chalkboard menu that read Clam Chowder Today, Just Like Yesterday. A shop called Moon &amp; Salt that sold crystals and secondhand books. Most of the storefronts were dark, windows fogged from the cold and condensation.</p><p>Rio pulled into a gravel parking spot near a tea shop, the only place still lit up like it meant it. Inside, the warm glow of Edison bulbs flickered against wood-paneled walls. A bell above the door jingled as she stepped in.</p><p>The air smelled like cinnamon, pine, and something faintly metallic—like old keys or blood oranges.</p><p>A woman stood behind the counter, serving a plate of something warm to a customer. She had wild silver curls, round glasses, and earrings shaped like tiny brooms. Her cardigan was buttoned all wrong, and she looked like someone who wouldn’t just talk to her plants, but expect them to talk back.</p><p>She looked up. “Well, hello there.”</p><p>Rio smiled, a little awkward. “Hi. I was hoping you could help me. I just got into town—”</p><p>“Oh, I can see that. You’ve got the fog on your boots and confusion in your eyes.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “I… okay.”</p><p>The woman leaned her elbows on the counter, studying her. “Let me guess. You’re a Vidal.”</p><p>That gave Rio pause. “How did you—?”</p><p>“Sweetheart, you’ve got Eliza’s mouth. And that walk—like you’re about to bolt or punch someone, but haven’t decided which.” Her smile softened. “I’m Lilia, by the way. Lilia Calderu. I run this place when it lets me.”</p><p>Rio took that in slowly. “Okay. Sure. Well, I just inherited a cottage? From my—apparently—grandmother, Eliza Vidal. I’ve never been here before.”</p><p>“Oh, honey. No one ever comes to Thistle Grove unless something brings them.” Lilia tilted her head, eyes glittering. “Do you know where the cottage is?”</p><p>“I was hoping someone could give me directions. All I got is ‘edge of the woods, near the well’”</p><p>Lilia’s smile curved. “You don’t find that house. It finds you.”</p><p>Rio exhaled. “Is that a thing here? Cryptic answers and small-town riddles?”</p><p>Lilia let out a barking laugh. “Oh, I like you. You’re Eliza’s granddaughter, alright. You’ve got her spark and her patience. Take the main road out of town, follow the fork toward the woods. When the trees start to lean in, you’ll see a narrow lane with no name and a crooked fence. That’s her.”</p><p>“Her?”</p><p>“The house,” Lilia said, like it was obvious. “She’s particular. And she hasn’t had anyone live in her since Eliza passed. Might be a bit moody.”</p><p>Rio stared.</p><p>Lilia gave a wink and reached under the counter, pulling out a small cloth pouch tied with twine. “For your first night. Cedar, salt, and a little lavender. Keeps the worst of the dreams at bay.”</p><p>Rio took it slowly. “Do I want to know what kind of dreams we’re talking about?”</p><p>“Depends what the house wants to show you,” Lilia said, her voice quiet now. “But don’t be afraid. She called you for a reason.”</p><p>The bell above the door jingled again as Rio stepped back out into the mist, pouch in hand.</p><p>The fog had thickened. The air had that heavy silence to it—like something was listening.</p><p>Rio looked down at the pouch, then toward the road.</p><p>“Okay, Eliza,” she muttered. “Let’s see what the hell you left me.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio followed the strange woman’s directions. The road narrowed the further she drove. Asphalt gave way to packed dirt, then gravel. The trees grew thicker on either side, bare branches reaching across the lane like fingers laced in prayer. Fog curled low to the ground, and her headlights barely cut through it. It didn’t feel like a road so much as a memory someone had forgotten to finish painting.</p><p>Rio kept glancing at the directions Lilia had scrawled on a scrap of brown paper—although really, they hadn’t been much. When the trees lean in, you’ll see it. </p><p>She was just about to mutter something about how incredibly unhelpful that was when the trees actually leaned in.</p><p>It wasn’t a metaphor. Not anymore. The pines and oaks actually bent slightly toward the road, as if drawn forward by some long-forgotten instinct. The wind had gone still. The radio had gone static. Even her phone had lost signal three turns ago.</p><p>And then she saw it.</p><p>At the end of the lane, nestled against the edge of a wood so dark it might as well have been night, stood the house.</p><p>Or what was left of it.</p><p>It looked like it had grown from the earth itself—twisting and weathered, with pale grey shingles that had curled at the edges and windows like sunken eyes. Ivy clung to the walls like veins. The porch sagged, one corner slightly caved in. The gate hung askew on a rusted hinge. It was the kind of house you’d expect to find in a ghost story, not a legal will.</p><p>Rio parked the rental and stepped out slowly, boots crunching on frostbitten gravel.</p><p>Up close, the house was no less eerie. The vines weren’t just ivy—some of them looked like flowering nightshade and creeping fig, all tangled together in impossible ways. Moss had overtaken the stone path. The wood was dark with age, but not rotten. Just… old. Like it was holding its breath.</p><p>Rio stood in front of the porch, staring up at the second-story window. For half a second, she thought she saw someone there—a flicker of movement. But when she blinked, it was gone.</p><p>“Jesus,” she muttered. “What the hell, Eliza.”</p><p>She put a hand on the railing. The wood was damp, but warm. Almost like it was alive and recognized her.</p><p>She hesitated. Then climbed the steps.</p><p>The front door was painted black, cracked and worn. No keyhole. No handle. Just a smooth iron plate carved with a delicate floral pattern—roses and thorns and something curling beneath it. She reached for it—</p><p>The door creaked open on its own.</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>She waited for some animal to scurry out. For some sound from within.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Just the smell of woodsmoke and dried herbs. And something else, beneath it all. Something like lilac, or old paper, or… memory.</p><p>Rio stepped over the threshold, bracing herself for dust and decay. But what hit her first wasn’t rot—it was warmth.</p><p>Soft and dry, the air inside the cottage smelled like cedar and cloves, with a faint undercurrent of something floral. It wasn’t what she expected. No mildew. No stale emptiness. Just… a lived-in stillness.</p><p>She stepped fully inside, her boots tapping against polished hardwood. To her left was a small sitting room, lit by the fading grey light outside filtering through lace curtains. A fire—an actual, contained, glowing fire—crackled in a stone hearth. That gave her pause.</p><p>“Maybe it’s on a timer,” she muttered, though she saw no signs of modern tech anywhere. No thermostat. No cords.</p><p>Still, the room was charming—antique furniture with deep cushions, bookshelves filled to the brim, a worn rug in muted tones of gold and green. Someone had clearly taken care of it. She assumed maybe a caretaker came by every so often, though the will hadn’t mentioned one.</p><p>The kitchen was tucked into the back, cozy and efficient. A collection of ceramic mugs hung on hooks above the counter, each one mismatched but clearly chosen with purpose. The cabinets were painted a soft sage green, the kind of color that felt like exhaling.</p><p>She opened the fridge on a whim. Empty, save for a single glass bottle of milk and a dish of what looked like homemade jam. No expiration dates. No labels. The kind of thing someone would make for themselves without thinking about it.</p><p>Rio let the door close and stood in the quiet, scanning the space again.</p><p>“Looks like someone still lives here,” she said, unsure if it was meant to be a joke.</p><p>Everything felt untouched and well-kept—but not sterile. Nothing was covered in sheets or dust. A book lay open on the arm of a chair. A folded blanket waited at the foot of the stairs. The cottage didn’t feel abandoned.</p><p>It felt expectant.</p><p>Still, she shook it off. Maybe Eliza had a housekeeper. Maybe someone from town checked on it after her death. Maybe she was just so used to disaster that anything short of it looked like magic.</p><p>She ran a hand through her damp hair and kicked off her boots by the door. The floor was warm beneath her socks.</p><p>As she climbed the stairs to explore the rest of the cottage, she didn’t see the way the fire burned a little brighter. Or how the curtain at the kitchen window stirred without wind. Or how, behind her, the door clicked shut with something like relief.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The stairs creaked beneath her step, but they held. The banister was smooth and worn, the kind of wood polished by generations of hands. Halfway up, she paused and glanced behind her. Still alone.</p><p>The second floor was narrow, with low ceilings and slanted walls. There were only two rooms—one bedroom, one small study—and a bathroom tucked between them. She peeked inside the latter first. The clawfoot tub was pristine. The tile looked old but clean, and the mirror over the sink was fogged with age at the corners, like it had seen more than it should’ve.</p><p>The bedroom was unexpectedly lovely.</p><p>A full-sized bed with a wrought-iron frame stood against the far wall, dressed in a patchwork quilt and faded linen sheets. A dresser with glass knobs sat across from it, and a tall window looked out over the woods. When she stepped closer, Rio realized she could just make out the edge of the town from here—a scattering of rooftops and a church steeple in the distance.</p><p>She opened the closet and found a handful of old coats and shawls hanging neatly in a row, each one smelling faintly of rose and tobacco. She let the door swing shut and rubbed her arms. The house was warm, but there was a strange tightness in her chest. Not fear—just that quiet, uncanny sense that she’d stepped into someone else’s story.</p><p>The study across the hall was lined with shelves. Books everywhere—spines cracked, some handwritten, some leather-bound, a few stacked sideways. A rolltop desk sat beneath the window, and on it, a single notebook. The cover was worn. A fountain pen rested across the top.</p><p>She didn’t touch it.</p><p>Instead, she exhaled and backed out of the room, closing the door gently behind her. Later, she told herself. When she wasn’t so damn tired.</p><p>Back downstairs, she slid her boots on, grabbed her jacket, and headed for the car. The sun was already sinking lower—how had it gotten so late?</p><p>She reversed down the narrow drive and turned toward town. This time, the road felt less eerie. More like it was giving her space.</p><p>The town proper was quaint in the way every New England postcard tried to be. A main street lined with brick buildings, hand-painted signs, and a few people closing up shop for the day. She found a small grocery store, the kind where the cash register was probably older than she was, and wandered the narrow aisles for bread, coffee, peanut butter, and a few cans of soup.</p><p>She was paying when she remembered: no service. No signal. No internet.</p><p>She turned to the cashier—a teenager with green nail polish and a nose ring. “Hey, is there a hardware store or something around here? Or anyone I could talk to about getting internet set up?”</p><p>The teen blinked slowly, then jerked her chin toward the back of the store. “You want Lilia. She’s probably still at The Hollow.”</p><p>“The Hollow?”</p><p>“It’s a finer…Teashop. It’s weird. You’ll see it.”</p><p>Rio raised a brow. “And she… does internet?”</p><p>“She knows everybody,” the girl said with a shrug. “If you want something done around here, Lilia’s your best bet.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio said, grabbing her bags. “Thanks.”</p><p>The bell over the door jingled as she stepped out into the dusk. The air smelled like woodsmoke and distant rain. She loaded the groceries into the car and stood there for a second, staring down the street.</p><p>The Hollow.</p><p>She wasn’t ready for it, but she was going anyway.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The Hollow didn’t look like much from the outside. Faded blue paint, a flickering porch light, and a hand-painted sign that read The Hollow Tea Shop—though it smelled more like diner grease and cinnamon than any teahouse Rio had ever walked into. Now she recognized it as the place she stopped at to ask for directions earlier.</p><p>Inside, it was… charming in that chaotic, homey way. Booths with mismatched cushions, tables dressed in floral oilcloth, and a chalkboard menu that offered both “Lavender Lemon Scones” and “Bacon Double Cheeseburgers.” At the far end of the room stood a long counter, and behind it—wearing a bright red apron and an unapologetically large crystal necklace—was Lilia Calderu.</p><p>She spotted Rio instantly. “Well, look what the fog dragged in.”</p><p>Rio gave a half-smile and let the warmth of the place settle around her. “Told you I’d find it.”</p><p>“Mm-hmm,” Lilia said, wiping her hands on a dishtowel. “And did it let you in?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “The house? Yeah. It was unlocked, actually.”</p><p>Lilia hummed in that same mysterious way she had before, like the words weren’t really about what they sounded like. “Then it’s yours, sure enough. Sit. I’ll get you a cup of tea. Or coffee. Or whiskey.”</p><p>“Tea’s good,” Rio said, sliding into a booth near the window. “And… weird question, but is there someone around here who installs internet? I’ve got no signal and no idea how I’m supposed to get work done.”</p><p>Lilia poured hot water into a floral teacup and brought it over herself, setting it down with a clink. “Internet, hmm? That’ll be Tommy Finch. Lives up on Rook Hill, but he only comes into town on Thursdays. Don’t trust anything that buzzes, that one, but he’ll wire you up if you ask nicely.”</p><p>“Thursday,” Rio said, sighing. “That’s three days.”</p><p>Lilia grinned. “Perfect amount of time to stop buzzing yourself. Might even help that writer’s block you’ve been dragging around.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed. “Did I say I was a writer?”</p><p>“No, darling,” Lilia said, already turning back toward the counter. “But it’s written all over you.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio had just taken her first sip of tea—sweet and herbal, surprisingly comforting—when the bell over the door chimed.</p><p>She didn’t look up right away. It was just someone coming in. Another local. Another stranger.</p><p>But then the air shifted.</p><p>It wasn’t anything dramatic. No gust of wind, no lightning bolt. Just… a stillness. A pressure behind her eyes. The tiny hairs on her arms lifted like they were being called to attention.</p><p>She turned her head—slowly, instinctively.</p><p>The woman who stepped inside didn’t look like much out of the ordinary. Long dark coat, boots wet from the fog, a canvas bag slung over her shoulder. Her dark hair was twisted up messily, like she hadn’t thought much about it. She didn’t glide or prowl or flick her gaze like she owned the place. She just moved—quiet, certain, present.</p><p>But Rio felt her before she saw her.</p><p>A pulse behind her ribs. A thrum beneath her skin. Something old and strange and rooted in a part of her that didn’t have words.</p><p>The woman’s eyes swept the room and paused—just briefly—on her.</p><p>It was only a glance, but it landed like a fingerprint on glass.</p><p>Then she turned to the counter and said, without looking back, “You’re out of lemon balm again.”</p><p>“Yes, I know,” Lilia called over her shoulder. “You don’t have to point it out.”</p><p>The woman gave a soft huff of amusement and slid onto a stool, shaking the mist from her coat. She peeled off her gloves finger by finger, efficient and practiced.</p><p>Lilia turned toward Rio with a smirk. “That there is Agatha Harkness. She’s got opinions about herbs and no manners to speak of.”</p><p>“I’m sitting right here, you know,” Agatha said mildly.</p><p>“You’re always right there,” Lilia replied. “Doesn’t make you polite.”</p><p>Rio blinked, still watching. Something in her bones was humming.</p><p>Agatha turned slightly, catching her gaze for real this time. Her eyes were an impressive shade of blue, like she was looking at a bright summer sky.</p><p>“New in town?” she asked, casual but not unkind.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to answer—and hesitated.</p><p>There it was again. That pull. Like recognition without memory.</p><p>“Yeah,” she said finally. “Just arrived earlier this afternoon.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, eyes narrowing just the slightest bit. “You must be a Vidal.”</p><p>Lilia cut in before Rio could ask how she knew. “She’s staying up at the old Vidal house.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression didn’t change. But something in her posture did—a small shift, a flicker in the shadows.</p><p>“The house let you in?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “It was unlocked.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved—not quite a smile. “That’s not what I asked.”</p><p>~*~</p>

<p>The bell above the door jingled, followed by the impatient thud of boots on old wood. Agatha Harkness didn’t need to look up to know it was Billy. No one else stomped like that and still called it a “grand entrance.”</p><p>“Did you rearrange the tinctures again?” he asked, peeling off his scarf dramatically and tossing it onto the counter. “Because I swear I labeled the passionflower correctly this time and someone—someone—put it in with the digestive bitters.”</p><p>“That someone was me,” Agatha said calmly, crushing dried lavender buds in her mortar. “And I’ll do it again. I told you I have my own system, teen.”</p><p>Billy groaned like she’d personally ruined his life. “You’re chaos incarnate.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “And you wear more eyeliner than sense.”</p><p>“Rude,” Billy muttered, before ducking into the back room.</p><p>The apothecary was quiet again, scented with sage and citrus peel and the low crackle of the space heater in the corner. A customer browsed the shelves in silence. Outside, fog clung to the windows like breath on glass.</p><p>Agatha returned to her work, grounding the lavender into a fine dust. Her hands moved out of habit, decades of muscle memory in her bones, her blood. She’d always been good with her hands—blending, binding, making.</p><p>It was everything else she was bad at.</p><p>She was halfway through mixing a headache draught when it hit her.</p><p>A thrum.</p><p>Soft. Subtle.</p><p>But unmistakable.</p><p>The air in the shop shifted—pressure dropping, something stirring beneath the surface of reality. It was like a forgotten chord being plucked, faint but resonant, vibrating through her bones.</p><p>She stilled.</p><p>Outside, the fog thickened.</p><p>The customer turned toward the front window and muttered something about the weather, but Agatha didn’t hear her. Her chest was tight all of a sudden, breath caught on something old and half-remembered.</p><p>No spells. No sigils. Just presence.</p><p>Someone had arrived. Someone powerful.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled around the edge of the counter. Her gaze drifted to the front door, though she didn’t know why. Not consciously.</p><p>Billy reappeared with a jar of dried rose hips, frowning at the silence. “Did something happen?”</p><p>Agatha blinked once and shook herself loose from the moment. “No,” she said, too quickly. “Nothing.”</p><p>But she didn’t return to her mixing.</p><p>She just stood there, the scent of lavender thick in the air, her thoughts spiraling like smoke.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The customer finally left with her elderberry syrup and instructions to drink it with lemon peel and honey. Agatha watched the door swing shut, then returned to the counter with her usual briskness. She hated lingering. Lingering gave feelings too much room to stretch out and grow teeth.</p><p>Billy, perched on a stool with one leg hooked over the rung, was still watching her. Closely.</p><p>“You felt that, didn’t you?” he said.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up. “Felt what?”</p><p>“The shift.”</p><p>She exhaled through her nose. “You’re being dramatic again.”</p><p>“You felt it,” he insisted. “Come on. My teeth felt it. Like a tiny earthquake or something.” He paused, leaning forward with that witch-born curiosity she usually found endearing but today, for some reason, just grated more than usual. “What was it?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Instead, she reached for the bundle of rosemary hanging above her head and began to strip the leaves.</p><p>Billy made a sound in the back of his throat—half-frustration, half-knowing—and let the silence stretch. But then, softly: “It’s her, isn’t it?”</p><p>That made her pause.</p><p>She didn’t say yes, but she didn’t deflect either.</p><p>Billy sat up straighter. His voice dropped, suddenly reverent. “The second Thread.”</p><p>Agatha gave him a warning look. “Don’t.”</p><p>“But it’s true, isn’t it?” His voice was low now, almost a whisper. “The way the air changed? Like something ancient woke up.”</p><p>Agatha went back to stripping rosemary. “You’ve been reading too many of your mother’s books.”</p><p>“Whoever it is, it’s not just a random stranger, is she?” he pressed. “You felt it, Aunt Agatha. I know you did.”</p><p>She turned on him suddenly, not angry—but there was a sharp edge in her voice. “And what do you think happens now, Billy? That we light a bonfire and chant under the moon? That the Threads just snap back into place like we’ve been waiting for a prophecy to come tap us on the shoulder?”</p><p>Billy blinked, caught off guard by the bite.</p><p>Agatha took a breath. Rolled her shoulders back. “Go inventory the teas. And leave the old magic where it belongs—in the ground. Forgotten.”</p><p>He didn’t argue. Just gave her a long look before slipping into the back room, quieter than usual.</p><p>Alone again, Agatha stared out the window at the fog curling low across the cobblestones. The sensation still hummed under her skin, low and insistent, like a secret knocking to be let out.</p><p>She told herself it meant nothing.</p><p>But she didn’t believe it.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Agatha locked up the apothecary with stiff fingers. The fog had thickened while she’d been inside, painting the narrow street in silver and shadow. Her boots clicked against the damp stone as she walked, the hem of her coat brushing her calves, her thoughts too loud inside her head.</p><p>The Hollow was only a few blocks away, tucked into the crook of the main square like it had always belonged there. She’d been feeling off since that weird power shift in the air earlier this afternoon, and she thought that maybe some of Lilia’s chamomile tea would work wonders on her mood.</p><p>The little bell over the door chimed as she stepped inside, warm air wrapping around her like a shawl.</p><p>The Hollow was warm with the scent of cinnamon and scorched coffee, honey and thyme. Late afternoon light slanted in through fog-fogged windows, catching in the steam that rose from mismatched mugs and chipped teapots.</p><p>She felt it before she saw her.</p><p>Not just a shift in the air, but a ripple down to her marrow. A sudden knowing that pressed against her ribs like an old bruise. Power—but quiet, submerged, unfamiliar. Old magic, thrumming just beneath the surface like a heartbeat under water.</p><p>Her eyes surveyed the space until they landed on her.</p><p>The woman sat at the counter as if she didn’t quite belong to the scene—boots damp from mist, denim jacket dark at the shoulders where the fog had settled.</p><p>Her eyes swept the room and paused—just briefly—on Agatha.</p><p>It was only a glance, but it landed like she had actually touched her skin.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath. Then she turned to the counter and said, without looking back, “You’re out of lemon balm again.”</p><p>“I know,” Lilia called over her shoulder. “No need to point it out.”</p><p>The woman gave a soft huff of amusement. Agatha watched her like she was trying to remember a name she’d never learned.</p><p>Lilia turned toward the woman with a smirk. “That there is Agatha Harkness. She’s got opinions about herbs and no manners to speak of.”</p><p>“I’m sitting right here, you know,” Agatha said mildly, still watching the woman.</p><p>“You’re always right there,” Lilia replied. “Doesn’t make you polite.”</p><p>The woman—Rio, her name would come later like a whisper remembered—blinked, still looking in Agatha’s direction. Her eyes were a hazel somewhere between forest and chocolate, and something in them sharpened when they landed on her again. Recognition flickered—of what, neither of them knew.</p><p>Agatha felt the pulse of it low and strange, deep in her chest.</p><p>“New in town?” she asked, casual but not unkind.</p><p>The woman opened her mouth to answer—and hesitated.</p><p>There it was again. That pull. Like recognition without memory. Like standing on the edge of something and realizing you’d already jumped.</p><p>“Yeah,” she said finally. “Just arrived earlier this afternoon.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, studying her more openly now. “You must be a Vidal.”</p><p>The name hung in the air like a key turned in a lock.</p><p>Before the woman could speak, Lilia cut in. “Eliza’s granddaughter. She’s staying up at the old Vidal house.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression didn’t change. But something inside her did—a subtle shift, like shadows pulling in tighter.</p><p>“The house let you in?” she asked.</p><p>The woman blinked. “It was unlocked.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved. “That’s not what I asked.”</p><p>She watched the woman process that. The flicker of confusion, the furrow between her brows. Then the wary amusement that rose to cover it.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she said, tilting her head. “I think I missed the part where houses are supposed to want things.”</p><p>“Oh, they want plenty,” Lilia said, scraping a bit of foam off the top of someone’s latte. “Just not always what you expect.”</p><p>The woman raised an eyebrow, then glanced back at Agatha. “Is everyone in Thistle Grove like this?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Only the interesting ones.”</p><p>The woman huffed—half-laugh, half-sigh—and turned back toward her tea.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look away.</p><p>Everything in her wanted to. She wasn’t supposed to feel things like this anymore. Hadn’t allowed herself to in years. Not since her mother had vanished into mist and memory. Not since her Nicky…</p><p>And yet—</p><p>She reached into the pocket of her coat, almost without thinking, and pulled out a small muslin satchel. It had lemon balm, feverfew, and a little chamomile. She slid it across the counter.</p><p>“For the headache,” she said.</p><p>The woman frowned at it. “I didn’t say I had a headache.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Agatha turned to go.</p><p>At the door, she paused, her fingers brushing the handle. The fog outside clung thick to the windows now, turning the light gauzy and gold.</p><p>She looked back once.</p><p>The woman was watching her, brows furrowed.</p><p>And Agatha felt it again—stronger, this time. The snap of something old and inevitable, stitched into the very air between them.</p><p>She said nothing.</p><p>Just stepped out into the mist and let the door swing closed behind her.</p><p>Outside, the air was damp and cold. Fog wound its way through the streets like something sentient, curling around lamp posts and creeping under doors. It should’ve been familiar. It was familiar. But everything felt…different now.</p><p>Agatha stood still for a moment – her reflection ghosted back at her in the glass of The Hollow’s front window — sharp cheekbones, dark coat, ocean-colored eyes.</p><p>That woman. Rio.</p><p>She hadn’t needed a name to recognize her. Her magic whispered like an old friend.</p><p>Because the power humming in her bones hadn’t been stirred by a stranger—it had known her. Known her like a storm knows its eye.</p><p>A tremor of something—fear, maybe, or anticipation—crawled down her spine. She didn’t like this feeling. Didn’t like what it meant. The Threads hadn’t been reunited and tangled in over a hundred years. And now—</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>Billy’s voice snapped her out of it. He stood just behind her, with his hoodie pulled up, the strings yanked so tight only a sliver of eyeliner-rimmed eyes peeked out. He carried a cinnamon roll in one hand and a lukewarm coffee in the other, looking entirely unbothered by the existential crisis she was clearly having.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha said, a little too fast.</p><p>Billy stared at her for a second. “You’re doing the broody stare thing again.”</p><p>“I don’t brood.”</p><p>“Aunt Agatha, your brood has a brood.”</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at him. “Shouldn’t you be at the apothecary?”</p><p>“You locked it.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose. Right. She had.</p><p>Billy looked at her over the rim of his coffee. “So. Come on. You felt it too, right?”</p><p>She didn’t answer, but she didn’t need to. He knew.</p><p>Billy’s grin curved like mischief. “Three Threads, back in the same place at the same time. It’s happening, huh?”</p><p>“It doesn’t mean anything,” she said flatly, turning to walk back toward the apothecary.</p><p>He followed, of course. “Uh, yes, it does. That’s the whole point of the Threads. They pull. They twist. They tangle.”</p><p>“I’m not interested in getting tangled.”</p><p>“You say that like it’s a choice.”</p><p>Agatha paused mid-stride. The street was quiet, save for the wind hissing through pine. The town looked the same as it had yesterday. And yet… every shadow felt deeper. Every flicker of candlelight in the windows felt sharper, more aware.</p><p>Agatha shot him a look. “Don’t.”</p><p>“I’m just saying—”</p><p>“Don’t say anything. Don’t do anything. Don’t go poking around where you don’t belong.”</p><p>Billy raised both hands like she’d drawn a knife on him. “Hey, I’m just the queer apprentice with a dramatic flair and a mild tendency toward chaos. You’re the one that’s been pretending that you’re not powerful and part of this for the past, what? Twenty years?”</p><p>Agatha turned sharply. “I’m not pretending.”</p><p>“Sure you’re not,” Billy said, taking another bite of his cinnamon roll.</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. Because what was there to say?</p><p>He wasn’t wrong. She had closed herself off. Sealed the cracks, bricked up the door, thrown away the key. Because when the magic got too strong, it burned. And when you let people in, they left. Or worse—they disappeared. They died.</p><p>She looked back down the fog-slick street toward The Hollow. She could still feel it—that vibration in the air, faint but steady. A tuning fork struck deep in her ribs.</p><p>Three Threads, once again stitched into the same story.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The next morning, the bell over the door jingled as Rio stepped inside the apothecary. Agatha didn’t look up immediately, though she could feel her presence as soon as she crossed the threshold. There was that same shift in the air—quiet but undeniable. It made the hairs on the back of her neck prickle.</p><p>The woman’s footsteps were tentative but purposeful. Agatha focused on the dried flowers in front of her, trying to ignore the subtle stirring inside her.</p><p>“Didn’t think I’d see you here,” Agatha finally said, her voice smooth, almost casual. She didn’t need to look up; she knew it was her. She’d known the moment the door had opened.</p><p>“I could use a few things,” Rio said, her tone lighter than it had been the night before, but still tinged with curiosity. “And I figured if I’m going to be here for a while, I should get familiar with the town and stuff.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, running her fingers along the jars of herbs behind the counter. “You’ve got to get your bearings when you’re new to town. It’s not the easiest place to settle in.”</p><p>Rio let out a small laugh. “Yeah, that’s kind of what I’m figuring out. I thought this would be a quiet escape, but I didn’t know I’d be walking into… well, all this.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but glance up at that, her eyes flicking over Rio briefly. “All this?”</p><p>“The town, the house… there’s something about this place. I don’t know if it’s the quiet, or just the weirdness of it all, but it feels like… I don’t know. Never mind,” she shrugged with a self deprecating laugh.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze lingered, her fingers pausing on the herbs. She knew exactly what Rio was talking about—what they were both talking about, though neither of them had said it directly.</p><p>“You might be right,” Agatha said, her voice even, but something flickered in her eyes. “Thistle Grove does have a way of making you feel like that. The town can be… particular about who it lets in.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened slightly. “First the cottage, and now it’s the town that lets people in or not? Lilia said the same thing yesterday.”</p><p>Agatha shifted slightly, the faintest tension in her shoulders. “Lilia likes to spin stories. But there’s some truth to it. The house, especially. It’s not like any normal house.”</p><p>A pause. The weight of the unspoken words seemed to hang in the air between them.</p><p>Rio finally broke the silence, her voice softer now. “I thought I was just here to get away from everything. To start over.”</p><p>“You can try,” Agatha said with a half-shrug. “I hope it works out.”</p><p>Rio hesitated for a moment, her eyes still on Agatha, searching for something. Agatha met her gaze evenly, but inside, something was stirring—something she didn’t want to acknowledge. She didn’t want to let herself feel it, especially not now, when everything felt so… uncertain.</p><p>“I guess. I’m Rio Vidal, by the way. Didn’t get to introduce myself last night,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha held her gaze a moment longer, then broke it, her fingers resuming their rhythm behind the counter. “I know. It’s nice to meet you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes lingered for a moment longer, then she turned toward the shelves, the brief moment of connection hanging in the air between them. Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that this wasn’t just an ordinary encounter—there was something more to this woman, to her presence, something she couldn’t explain.</p><p>“Anything in particular you’re looking for?” Agatha asked, her voice now more neutral, trying to shift the conversation back to something simple, something normal.</p><p>Rio turned back to her, offering a small smile. “Lemon balm. I’m still trying to get used to this place. Figured it’d be good for… everything.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow. “You don’t strike me as someone who needs calming.”</p><p>Rio gave a short laugh. “Maybe not. But I could use a little help unwinding.”</p><p>A pause. And then, Agatha couldn’t resist. She leaned in slightly, lowering her voice just a touch.</p><p>“Maybe you should try lavender instead. Works wonders for a restless mind.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued but still holding something back. “Lavender, huh?”</p><p>“Trust me,” Agatha said, her lips twitching into the faintest of smiles. “It’s one of the few things I know really well.”</p><p>The silence stretched between them for a moment as Rio considered the lavender suggestion. Agatha’s gaze flicked back to the shelves, her fingers trailing over the rows of herbs, all while she could feel Rio’s presence lingering like a magnetic pull. The air around them hummed with something almost unspoken, something that Agatha couldn’t shake, no matter how hard she tried to push it down.</p><p>“So, what’s this place like? Thistle Grove, I mean,” Rio asked, her voice soft, like she was still testing the waters between them.</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, leaning back against the counter, trying to look casual even though the tension in the room was palpable. “It’s a small town. People know each other, but they don’t always want to. Most people come here looking for something quiet, but they get more than they bargained for.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, eyeing her curiously. “Like what?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated for a moment, considering how much to say. She’d never been one to talk about the strange magic that ran under the town’s skin, under her own. But there was something about Rio—something that made Agatha wonder if maybe, just maybe, it was time to stop hiding.</p><p>“You’ll find out soon enough,” Agatha finally said, offering a cryptic smile. “It has a way of catching up with you.”</p><p>Before Rio could respond, the bell over the door jingled again, and Agatha’s attention immediately shifted. She didn’t even need to look up; she could feel it—the shift in the air that made her spine tingle, the subtle but unmistakable feeling that the threads were almost whole again.</p><p>Wanda.</p><p>Her best friend and the one person Agatha had always been able to rely on, even when everything felt impossible. But more than that—Wanda was the third Thread. And one hell of a powerful witch.</p><p>The door swung open wider as Wanda stepped into the shop, a gust of wind and the unmistakable scent of lavender trailing behind her. She was laughing as called out a greeting over her shoulder to someone outside, her usual carefree energy filling the space before she even spoke.</p><p>“Agatha! I swear you never stock enough of—” Wanda froze the moment she crossed the threshold, her eyes snapping to Rio with a force that was almost too sharp.</p><p>“Holy fuck.”</p><p>For a moment, the world seemed to still. Rio’s gaze flicked up to Wanda, confusion flickering in her eyes.</p><p>Wanda didn’t move, didn’t speak for a heartbeat. Then, slowly, she turned to Agatha, her voice low and filled with something Agatha couldn’t quite name. “You feel it, don’t you?”</p><p>“Not here,” Agatha said under her breath, her voice low, but firm. The familiar knot of unease twisted in her stomach, and her fingers tightened around the edge of the counter. “We’ll talk later.”</p><p>Wanda’s mouth twisted in annoyance, but she didn’t argue. She wasn’t stupid; she could read the tension in the air. “Fine,” she said, her gaze flicking toward Rio with a subtle edge. “But you know what this means, right?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze hardened. “It means we don’t talk about it here.”</p><p>Wanda gave a reluctant nod before turning her attention to Rio, a warm smile plastered across her face as she stepped forward. “Sorry about that. I’m Wanda. Agatha’s best friend—and partner in crime, sometimes.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, still puzzled but polite. “Nice to meet you. I’m Rio.” She glanced at Agatha, who seems to stiffen at the introduction, her mouth pressing into a thin line.</p><p>“Rio is Eliza Vidal’s granddaughter,” Agatha explained quickly “She’s staying at the old Vidal house.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes widened for a split second before she recovered, though the look on her face was anything but casual now. Rio caught the brief flash of something—awe, recognition, but mostly disbelief.</p><p>“Right,” Wanda says, the smile now strained. “That place has been empty for what, over ten years? Well, I hope it’s treating you well.” She gave Rio a tight-lipped grin, but the expression didn’t quite reach her eyes. “And if you need anything, don’t hesitate to ask.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio said, giving Wanda a curious look, but Wanda was already backing away, her gaze flicking toward Agatha once more.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “You’ll want the lavender balm for relaxation. And tea for sleep.”</p><p>Rio nodded, glancing at the jars of herbs on the counter, still a bit unsettled by the entire exchange. Something in the air felt too thick, like a door she hadn’t yet opened.</p><p>“Thanks again,” Rio says, her voice a little quieter than before.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze lingered on her, studying her with an unreadable expression. There was that feeling again, like something sas pulling at her insides, something just beyond her grasp.</p><p>“Take care of yourself,” Agatha said softly, more to herself than Rio. “It’s on the house,” she added when Rio asked how much it was. “Just a welcome to Thistle Grove present.”</p><p>Rio nodded and offered a small smile. As she headed out the door, Wanda let out an audible breath, her whole body going rigid once the door closed behind her.</p><p>Agatha didn’t even look at her. She was already turning to put away the stuff she used to make the balm for Rio, her fingers moving mechanically, as if the conversation never happened.</p><p>But Wanda’s eyes narrowed, and she watched Rio leave with an intensity that makes Agatha’s skin prickle.</p><p>“You feel it, don’t you?” Wanda’s voice was a near-whisper. “The Threads. All three of us. Jesus Christ, it feels like my magic is about to burst out of my skin.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression hardened  instantly, her jaw setting. She didn’t  answer right away. When she finally does, her voice is cold, low. “It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>Wanda scoffed. “It always matters, Agatha. Always.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand tightened around the jar of tea, her fingernails biting into the porcelain. She didn't want to deal with this. Not now. Not yet.</p><p>And definitely not with Rio Vidal.</p><p>Wanda wasn’t so easily dismissed. She stepped closer, her eyes gleaming with intensity, her tone lowering but still pressing. “You can’t just ignore it, Aggie. All three Threads are back in Thistle Grove. After all these years…”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened, her back going rigid at the mention of the Threads. Her fingers flexed as if to steady herself, to hold onto something real. Her pulse quickened, but she was careful not to show it. “Wanda,” she said, her voice low and warning. “I’m not doing this here.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t relent, though. “You can’t just pretend it’s not happening, not with her already here. The moment I walked in… I felt it. I know you did too.”</p><p>Wanda leaned in, her voice quieter now, but laced with urgency. “Do you even know what this means, Agatha? After all these years, the Threads are finally together again. Do you know what that feels like?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart started to race, her breath coming a little faster. She could feel it, too—deep in her bones. That pull. But she’d been running from this for decades, burying it, hiding from the magic that once consumed her.</p><p>“I said not here,” Agatha hissed through clenched teeth. She was trying, so hard, to keep it together, but the weight of the situation pressed in, heavy on her chest. She couldn’t let it happen. Not now. Not when she’d worked so hard to keep everything buried.</p><p>Wanda’s expression softened, but only slightly. She crosses her arms, eyes narrowing, still unwilling to let go. “I don’t get why you’re fighting this. Why are you still holding back? You’ve got so much power, honey. Together, we hold… god, so much power. This is what has been written, what we’ve been waiting for. I didn’t think it’d happen to us, because I thought it’d died with Eliza but—”</p><p>Agatha finally met Wanda’s gaze, her expression hard as stone. “I’m not waiting for anything. I’m done with this.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence, the air thick with unspoken tension, before Wanda gave a frustrated huff. “Fine,” she said, turning her back on Agatha, though she was not done. Not by a long shot. “But you can’t deny what’s happening. It’s bigger than us. You know that.”</p><p>Agatha watched as Wanda made her way to the door. When she turned back, her expression was more serious than before. “I’ll let it go for now, but I’m not going to let you pretend this isn’t happening forever.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled into a thin, tight smile. “And I’m not going to talk about it. Not yet.”</p><p>Wanda opened  her mouth, but Agatha held up a hand to stop her. “Just let it go, Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda’s shoulders sagged with frustration, but she nodded. “Fine. But we both know you’re not going to be able to ignore it for long.”</p><p>Agatha turned away, her fingers gripping the counter, her mind racing. She’d worked too hard to keep this buried, to keep her magic in check. She didn’t want to be part of any mythical story, she didn’t want to have anything to do with this.</p><p>But now, with Rio Vidal in town, everything was changing. Her magic thrummed under her skin.</p><p>And Agatha had no idea how to hold it back. Not anymore.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The first thing Rio noticed when she woke up was the quiet.</p><p>Not the oppressive kind, like the sterile hush of her old apartment in LA, but a deeper, more deliberate silence. The kind that wrapped around her like a thick quilt, comforting and just a little strange.</p><p>Rio blinked up at the ceiling, still half-tangled in the heavy, floral-print blankets. Morning light filtered through the sheer curtains, dappling the old wood floors with watery gold. The air smelled faintly of something earthy and sweet—cedar and maybe the remnants of the cinnamon tea she’d brewed the night before.</p><p>She sat up slowly. Her muscles ached from the travel, and her neck had a crick in it from sleeping in a bed that wasn’t quite broken in—but it was the best rest she’d had in weeks.</p><p>The kitchen had been stocked with the basics last night after a quick, slightly surreal trip to the local grocery store. She’d made a simple dinner, read a few pages of a dog-eared book she’d found on the shelf upstairs, and then passed out fully clothed.</p><p>Now, everything felt… real. Settled.</p><p>Her bare feet hit the creaky floor, and she padded to the window. The vines were still there, curling over the edges of the porch roof like skeletal fingers, but the garden below—wild as it was—looked peaceful in the morning light. Dew glittered on the overgrown grass, and birds chirped somewhere nearby.</p><p>Rio wrapped her sweater tighter around herself and wandered into the kitchen.</p><p>It still smelled like home.</p><p>She hadn’t expected that. Not here. Not in a strange, vine-choked cottage left to her by a grandmother she’d never met. But there was something about the warmth in the wooden counters, the sunlight spilling across the tiled floor, the faint clink of wind chimes outside the back door… It all felt lived in.</p><p>Welcoming.</p><p>The thought gave her pause.</p><p>It hadn’t looked welcoming from the outside—not with the sagging porch and the ivy clinging like a warning. But inside, it was like the house had recognized her.</p><p>Nope. Not going there, she told herself, yanking open the fridge and pulling out the cream for her coffee. She was too tired for ghost theories or fairy-tale metaphors. This place was just… old. And weirdly well-kept. Probably by some hidden local caretaker. That made sense.</p><p>Mostly.</p><p>She carried her mug to the writing desk tucked into the corner of the living room. She’d cleared it off last night—half expecting to find dust, mice, or a long-forgotten taxidermy collection. But instead, there had been a vase of dried lavender and a single, carefully folded note.</p><p>
<em> Welcome home. </em>
</p><p>No signature. Just those two words, in faded ink.</p><p>Rio had tucked it back in the drawer, trying not to read too much into it. Trying not to feel too much. But now, as she sat down with her coffee and glanced at the empty page in her notebook, something twinged in her chest.</p><p>She was here. She had left everything behind—Carol, the city, the apartment filled with all the wrong memories—and now she had this house, this strange town, this fresh page.</p><p>Time to start something new, she thought.</p><p>After all, she had no deadlines, no expectations. Just a stubborn house, a borrowed kettle, and maybe—if she was lucky—the tiniest flicker of a new beginning.</p><p>~*~</p><p>She left her mug in the sink, tugged on boots she’d found by the door—well-worn, dusty, just her size—and stepped outside.</p><p>The air was cool, damp with dew, and carried the faint scent of earth and pine. Behind the cottage, a narrow path wound its way into the woods. Not much more than a gap in the undergrowth, really, but it called to her. She followed without thinking, like something old and half-remembered was pulling her forward.</p><p>Birdsong threaded through the branches overhead, soft and sporadic. The trees here were tall and thick, their bark mottled with moss, their leaves still wet from the morning mist. It felt like stepping into another time—older, quieter, expectant.</p><p>She passed a rusted-out wheelbarrow leaning against a tree, half-swallowed by ivy. A broken-down fence. A few flat stones arranged in a circle, their meaning long since forgotten.</p><p>Everything about the woods felt lived-in, but not by people.</p><p>The deeper she went, the more she noticed it—that odd awareness in the air. Like the trees were watching. Like the path itself was guiding her.</p><p>She stopped near a crooked birch, her breath puffing visibly. “Okay,” she said aloud, voice quiet but steady. “I’m officially being weird.”</p><p>But the woods didn’t laugh. They just breathed.</p><p>A few more steps and she found a small, half-collapsed bench tucked beneath a maple tree. She sat, arms wrapped around her knees, and looked up through the canopy. Light filtered through in broken shafts, illuminating motes of dust that danced like fireflies.</p><p>It was the first time in months she felt… still.</p><p>Not content, exactly. Not happy. But still. Like something inside her had quit its restless pacing.</p><p>After a while, she stood, brushed off her jeans, and turned back toward the cottage. She had things to do. Groceries to unpack. Maybe go into town and see about getting someone to hook her up with Wi-Fi.</p><p>Back to civilization.</p><p>Or… what passed for it in Thistle Grove.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The bell above the door chimed softly as she stepped out of the apothecary and into the pale afternoon light. She clutched the small brown paper bag of herbs to her chest, still trying to make sense of what had just happened.</p><p>The redhead—Wanda, apparently—had looked at her like she’d just risen from the dead. Eyes wide, mouth half-open, the color draining from her face before rushing back twice as bright. And Agatha—cool, unreadable Agatha—had cut her off with nothing more than a look.</p><p>The silence between the two of them had been deafening.</p><p>Rio let out a breath and shook her head, boots crunching against gravel as she crossed the street. “Weird as fuck,” she muttered under her breath.</p><p>This town. This cottage. These people.</p><p>She wasn’t in the mood to go back to the cottage just yet, and her stomach rumbled in agreement. She had enjoyed The Hollow yesterday, and after the morning she’d had, a sandwich and something with caffeine sounded like a decent plan. Maybe she’d even break out her sketchpad, see if anything creative came out of this fog-soaked witch-town vibe.</p><p>The Hollow was exactly as she remembered it—quirky signage, crooked windows, and the faint smell of baked bread and something citrusy drifting from inside. The place was quiet when she walked in. No Lilia today, just a teenage girl with a nose ring and dyed blue hair scrolling through her phone behind the counter.</p><p>“Seat yourself,” the girl said, without looking up.</p><p>Rio nodded, slid into a booth near the window, and dropped her bag onto the bench beside her. She ordered an avocado BLT and a black tea, then pulled out her sketchpad and pencil from her satchel. It had been months since she’d drawn anything that didn’t feel forced or half-dead, but now, something in her fingers itched.</p><p>She sketched without really thinking. The curve of a vine creeping across a windowsill. A coffee cup ringed with condensation. The shadow of a woman’s jawline, sharp and elegant, almost accidental.</p><p>Her pencil stilled.</p><p>She frowned down at the page.</p><p>The woman in the sketch had her hair pinned up and a knowing tilt to her mouth. Eyes like a tumultuous ocean.</p><p><em> Agatha</em>.</p><p>Rio cursed softly under her breath and flipped to a new page.</p><p>Outside, the light was beginning to shift—slanting golden now, pouring in through the window in long, stretched beams. She blinked, glanced at the clock. Late afternoon already. She hadn’t meant to stay this long.</p><p>The bell over the door chimed again.</p><p>And suddenly, the air changed.</p><p>Rio didn’t look up right away. But she felt it—like static across her skin, like the moment before a storm. That same hum from the woods. From the cottage.</p><p>She lifted her eyes.</p><p>Agatha stood in the doorway, shoulders wrapped in a dark coat, cheeks a little flushed from the cold. Her gaze swept the café, pausing when it found her.</p><p>Rio swallowed and looked down at her sketchpad, suddenly aware of how quiet the place had gotten.</p><p>Agatha approached with deliberate calm, each step unhurried, boots making a soft tap on the wooden floor.</p><p>“You again,” she said when she reached the table.</p><p>Rio lifted her chin, tried for casual. “I could say the same.”</p><p>A hint of a smirk touched Agatha’s mouth. “You’re bleeding Thistle Grove all over your sketchpad.”</p><p>“I guess,” Rio chuckled, self consciously.</p><p>Agatha didn’t ask if she could sit—she just did, sliding into the booth across from Rio with the kind of quiet confidence that felt like it belonged to someone who never asked for permission. She folded her coat beside her, dark hair damp at the ends from the mist outside, and leveled her gaze at Rio as if they’d been mid-conversation already.</p><p>Rio blinked, pen paused over the edge of her sketchpad. “You don’t strike me as the type to do small talk.”</p><p>“I’m not,” Agatha said, voice dry. “But I make exceptions. Occasionally.”</p><p>“Lucky me.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, something like a smile tugging at the edge of her mouth. “You have that look.”</p><p>“What look?”</p><p>“The one people wear when they don’t know whether to leave or stay. Thought maybe I’d save you the trouble of pretending to be busy with your tea.”</p><p>Rio gave a soft huff, leaning back in the booth. “Wow. You’re charming.”</p><p>“I’ve been told. Usually not as a compliment.”</p><p>Rio snorted despite herself. “So what, you just go around sitting with strangers?”</p><p>“You’re not a stranger,” Agatha said. “You’re Eliza Vidal’s granddaughter.”</p><p>The statement landed like a stone tossed in still water—soft, but echoing outwards. Rio blinked and dropped her gaze to her tea, fingers tightening slightly around the cup.</p><p>“Right. You said that yesterday.” She tried to sound casual. “That’s still weird, by the way. How did you know?”</p><p>“This is Thistle Grove,” Agatha said. “We all knew of Eliza Vidal and you look remarkably like her. And people remember things. Especially things that have to do with the Vidal house.”</p><p>Rio looked up, narrowing her eyes slightly. “You mean the creaky old house with vines swallowing the porch?”</p><p>Agatha gave a shrug. “The one and only.”</p><p>Rio studied her, uncertain. “Did you know her?”</p><p>“Eliza?” Agatha looked away for a moment, as if weighing the truth. “Yeah.”</p><p>“That’s vague.”</p><p>“I specialize in vague.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and reached for her sketchpad again, tapping the edge with her pen. “Well, I didn’t come here for nostalgia, if that’s what you’re wondering.”</p><p>“I wasn’t,” Agatha said evenly. Then, after a pause: “So what <em> did </em> bring you here?”</p><p>The question hung in the air a little too long. Rio didn’t answer right away, distracted by the low hum in her chest again—the one that always seemed to thrum a little louder when this woman was near.</p><p>She exhaled slowly. “I needed a change.”</p><p>“From what?”</p><p>“From… everything.” She gestured vaguely. “My girlfriend of four years dumped me a couple of months ago, my publisher is waiting on pages I can’t seem to write, and my apartment has become a temple of old takeout containers and shame.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “That’s… refreshingly honest.”</p><p>“I don’t have the energy to pretend otherwise.”</p><p>There was a flicker of something in Agatha’s eyes then—recognition, maybe. Or sympathy buried deep beneath years of distance.</p><p>“I’m from Portland, originally,” Rio added, quieter now. “Oregon, not Maine. But I’ve lived in LA for a while. I never met Eliza. Never knew she existed. Never even knew the house was mine until some lawyer tracked me down.”</p><p>“It’s been empty for a long time,” Agatha said. “Surprised it let you in.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “You and Lilia keep saying things like that. Like the house is alive or something.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply, just wrapped her hands around her tea and took a long sip.</p><p>“I mean, yeah, it was unlocked,” Rio muttered. “Maybe weird, but I guess it’s a small town. Maybe someone figured it was okay to leave it unlocked.”</p><p>Agatha gave a faint, unreadable smile. “If you say so.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward, voice dropping. “Seriously. What’s the deal with this town?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze sharpened just slightly. “You’ll find out soon enough.”</p><p>“Cryptic. Again.”</p><p>“Better than lying.”</p><p>There was silence between them for a moment. Just the soft clink of cutlery and the wind brushing the windows.</p><p>Then Agatha asked, more softly this time, “So you’re staying? For a while?”</p><p>“I think so.” Rio’s voice was quieter too, almost reluctant. “I don’t have anywhere else to be.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Then you’ll need firewood. And thicker coats.”</p><p>Rio arched a brow. “What are you, the town’s welcome committee?”</p><p>Agatha smiled at that—just barely. “Hardly. But I know how unforgiving this place can be when you’re not ready for it.”</p><p>Rio’s expression flickered at the sudden sincerity. But before she could say anything else, Agatha was already sliding out of the booth, gathering her coat.</p><p>As she stood, she glanced back over her shoulder. “Be careful with the woods.”</p><p>Rio stared. “Okay, that’s the second time someone’s said that to me.”</p><p>Agatha paused, something unreadable in her gaze. “It’s easy to get lost out here.”</p><p>And then she was gone.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The Hollow’s signal wasn’t perfect, but it was just enough for Rio to place a few online orders before heading back to the cottage. She scrolled through listings of winter jackets and fleece-lined leggings, biting her lip as she added a few things to her cart. Wool socks, a good pair of boots, those ridiculous but probably necessary thermal underlayers.</p><p>Thistle Grove clearly hadn’t gotten the memo that she was an LA girl through and through.</p><p>She hit “purchase” with a sigh and slid her phone into her coat pocket. Outside, the sky was already starting to shift toward dusk—burnt gold bleeding into gray. On her way home, she stopped at the small hardware store where a sleepy-eyed teenager with a nose ring sold her a bundle of chopped firewood and gave her a crash course on how not to burn the cottage down.</p><p>She stacked the wood by the hearth as soon as she got in, then stood there for a moment, staring at the empty fireplace. It had been a long time since she’d needed warmth like this. Real, crackling warmth. The kind you couldn’t switch on with a remote.</p><p>The next few days passed in a sort of suspended rhythm. Quiet. Steady. Cold.</p><p>She walked into town a few more times, grateful for the fresh air and the excuse to stop by The Hollow again for coffee or soup, even if Agatha didn’t show up. She didn’t go back to the apothecary—not yet—but she thought about it more than she liked to admit. Her new coats arrived. So did the socks. She was, for the first time since arriving, starting to feel… not quite at home, but something close to it.</p><p>By Saturday morning, a local technician finally made it up the winding road to the Vidal house, grumbling about signal strength and “weather interference” as he installed a small satellite dish on the side of the house. The moment the Wi-Fi connected, Rio practically kissed her router.</p><p>She FaceTimed Alice that afternoon from the kitchen, still bundled in a sweater and thick socks, with a steaming mug of coffee cradled in both hands.</p><p>Alice answered on the first ring.</p><p>“<em>Oh my god</em>,” she said. “You’re alive. I was two hours away from calling the National Guard!”</p><p>Rio smiled sheepishly. “Sorry. It’s been a week.”</p><p>“A week?! Rio! You sent me one text! ‘<em>Got here alive, I think. TTYL</em>.’ What does that even mean?”</p><p>“It meant I got here alive,” Rio said, sipping her coffee. “And that I would talk to you later.”</p><p>Alice stared. “You thought you’d talk to me later. Babe, what if you got murdered by some New England psycho?”</p><p>Rio snorted. “No psychos. Just cranky apothecaries and a woman who runs a teashop-slash-diner with zero respect for labeling.”</p><p>Alice narrowed her eyes. “Apothecary?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “It’s a weird town. Cute, but weird. And there’s this house, Alice. You should see it. It’s… something.”</p><p>“I’ll believe that when you actually show me photos. And videos. You do remember how to send those, right?”</p><p>“I had no internet all week. I just got it set up an hour ago. My only contact with civilization was when I went into town for a couple of hours”</p><p>Alice gasped. “No internet? For five days? Who even <em> are </em> you?”</p><p>“Apparently someone who owns flannel now.”</p><p>“Damn. She’s changed.”</p><p>Rio laughed, soft and real, and leaned back in her chair. The warmth from the fire still lingered on her skin. “I think I kind of needed the quiet.”</p><p>Alice softened on the other end of the screen. “Yeah. I figured you might.”</p><p>They talked for another hour—about nothing and everything. About Carol (briefly), about Alice’s newest obsessions (a horror-themed pottery class), and about whether Rio thought she might actually stay in Thistle Grove longer than just a couple of weeks.</p><p>Rio didn’t have an answer to that yet.</p><p>But she did glance out the window at the snow-dusted trees, at the curling chimney smoke, at the half-finished sketch of the apothecary that sat on the kitchen table beside her coffee.</p><p>And for the first time in a long time, she didn’t feel like running.</p><p>~*~</p><p>By the time the sun dipped behind the trees that Saturday night, the chill had turned sharp. The kind of cold that bit through her coat and settled into her bones, no matter how many layers she wore.</p><p>Rio had planned to stay in, maybe sketch a bit more, maybe organize her references for the graphic novel she still couldn’t bring herself to start. But when she looked around the warm, flickering quiet of the cottage, something restless sparked in her chest.</p><p>She needed to be somewhere else. Even if it was just for an hour. Even if it was just to remember what people sounded like when they talked to each other over drinks.</p><p>The only bar in Thistle Grove was a narrow place on Main Street with a crooked neon sign that read The Silver Mare. She’d passed it earlier in the week, made note of the single dartboard and the dusty jukebox in the corner. It looked like the kind of bar where nothing ever happened.</p><p>She tugged on her thickest coat, ran a brush through her hair, and told herself she was just going for one drink. Maybe two. Just enough to feel like herself again.</p><p>The place was half full when she walked in. Low lighting. Warm wood. Locals scattered around, most of them bundled in fleece and flannel. A fire crackled in the corner hearth, and a few people looked up, curious, but not unkind.</p><p>Rio made her way to the bar and ordered a whiskey neat, the heat of it steady and immediate when it hit her throat. She was halfway through the glass when she heard the door open again behind her.</p><p>And then she felt it.</p><p>That same strange shift in the air she hadn’t been able to name. Not wind. Not static. Just… something.</p><p>She didn’t have to turn around to know who it was.</p><p>Agatha Harkness walked in like the cold had nothing on her—black coat fitted close, hair unpinned and falling in dark waves down her shoulders, the bar’s dim lights catching on the edges of her cheekbones. She spotted Rio almost instantly.</p><p>Rio blinked, tried to act casual as she turned on her stool. “Fancy meeting you here,” she said, trying for wry.</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched as she stepped closer. “You’re everywhere lately.”</p><p>“You’re the one who walked in after me.”</p><p>“And yet it feels like fate.”</p><p>Rio arched a brow, caught off guard by the flirtation—or maybe just how easily it came. “You come here often?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged out of her coat and draped it over the back of a nearby chair. “Sometimes. When I can’t sleep. When the house is too quiet. When Billy’s being insufferable.”</p><p>Rio lifted her glass, brow quirking. “Billy?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched like she already knew what Rio was wondering. “My one employee. Seventeen. Wears too much eyeliner. Thinks sarcasm is a love language.”</p><p>Rio smiled, letting herself relax an inch. “Not your husband, then.”</p><p>That earned her a low laugh, quiet but real. “<em>God, no.</em>”</p><p>Rio tried not to read into the way her chest loosened at that. “Sounds like a character.”</p><p>“He is,” Agatha said fondly, despite herself. “He’s also Wanda’s kid. And my godson.”</p><p>“The redhead from your shop?”</p><p>“That’s the one.”</p><p>Rio hummed, settling deeper into the moment, into the firelight and Agatha’s voice, into the warmth unfurling in her stomach that had nothing to do with the whiskey.</p><p>“And you?” Agatha asked, tilting her head. “What brought you here tonight? Restless?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, then nodded. “Something like that. Cabin fever, maybe. Or maybe I just wanted to remember what it feels like to be around people who don’t exist on a page.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression shifted slightly—interested now. “Writer?”</p><p>“Graphic novelist.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Let me guess—moody loner with a tragic backstory?”</p><p>Rio mock-sighed. “You’re frighteningly good at this.”</p><p>“Hazard of the trade,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Rio turned more fully toward her. “What trade is that, exactly?”</p><p>Agatha paused, her fingers circling her glass of wine. “Let’s call it… the quiet observation of people.”</p><p>Rio studied her, thoughtful. “That sounds like a fancy way of saying you’re nosy.”</p><p>“That too,” Agatha said, and her smile widened just a fraction.</p><p>Rio tilted her glass toward Agatha. “To nosy women, then.”</p><p>Agatha raised hers in return, the glint of amusement still dancing in her eyes. “The backbone of every small town.”</p><p>They drank, and for a few moments, silence settled between them—not uncomfortable, but laced with something heavier. Something almost anticipatory.</p><p>Rio set her glass down, fingertips brushing condensation from the rim. “So what about you? Always lived here?”</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, one arm slung casually along the back of it. “Born here. Left when I was eighteen. Came back… a few years later.”</p><p>There was something in her voice—an edge dulled by time, but not forgotten.</p><p>Rio didn’t press, but she asked gently, “Was it hard? Coming back?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked toward the fire, then back to her. “It was… necessary.”</p><p>A pause. Then Agatha countered, “And you? What finally made you come check out the cottage?”</p><p>Rio gave a quiet laugh. “Honestly? I didn’t even know it existed until like a week ago.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Seriously?”</p><p>Rio nodded, resting her chin in her hand. “Got this letter out of the blue. Said I inherited a property in some town I’d never heard of, from a grandmother I never knew. Eliza Vidal.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression didn’t change much, but her eyes sharpened, just slightly.</p><p>“I was going through a breakup,” Rio continued, tracing a droplet of condensation down her glass. “Four years down the drain. She cheated and left me, I imploded, and then this envelope showed up like some kind of cosmic dare. So I packed a suitcase, shut off my phone, and here I am.”</p><p>Agatha leaned forward a little, her voice softer now. “And how’s it going so far? Small town life, creaky cottage, weird locals?”</p><p>Rio gave her a wry smile. “Honestly? It’s… not what I expected. The cottage looks like it’s been abandoned for decades, but the inside’s kind of cozy. Comfortable. And the town’s definitely weird, but in an offbeat, maybe-I’ll-get-used-to-it way.”</p><p>“You sound surprised.”</p><p>“I’ve always been a city girl. I guess I thought I’d hate it.” She looked away, briefly. “Or that it’d spit me back out.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze didn’t waver. “But it didn’t.”</p><p>“No,” Rio admitted. “It didn’t.”</p><p>There was a beat of quiet before Agatha asked, “You planning on staying long?”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to answer—and then paused. “I don’t know yet. I think I just needed to breathe for a while. Figure out what comes next.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, like she understood more than she let on. “Well… Thistle Grove’s good for breathing. And for figuring things out.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, watching her. “Speaking from experience?”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth curved just slightly. “Something like that,” Then, after a moment, she added, “I’m getting fries. You want anything?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Fries are good.”</p><p>“You learn a lot about a person by how they eat them.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “And what have you learned about me so far?”</p><p>Agatha stood, one brow arching. “Still figuring that out.”</p><p>And with that, she turned toward the bar, her coat trailing behind her like ink in water.</p><p>Rio watched her go, a little breathless and a little warm, and wondered—not for the first time—just what the hell she had walked into in this strange little town.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Agatha returned a few minutes later with a basket piled high with golden fries and two small glasses of something amber. She slid one toward Rio without comment and sat down again. Her sleeves were rolled to the elbows, revealing pale forearms dusted faintly with freckles.</p><p>Rio reached for a fry. “So. What’s the verdict?”</p><p>Agatha popped one into her mouth, chewing thoughtfully. “Not bad. Crisp. Salty. Could be hotter.”</p><p>Rio gave her a look. “I meant about me.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Still too early to say. But you pass the fry test so far.”</p><p>Rio leaned back in her chair. “Whew, that’s a relief. I was starting to worry.”</p><p>They ate in companionable silence for a few minutes, the sounds of the bar humming softly around them—muted conversation, clinking glasses, a song from the jukebox that was probably older than both of them. Outside, the wind picked up, rattling the windows.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her, her voice a little quieter now. “So. You’re a graphic novelist.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Trying to be again. It’s been… hard lately.”</p><p>“Writer’s block?”</p><p>“Among other things.” She pushed her glass gently in a slow circle on the table. “It’s like the stories are still in there somewhere, but I can’t get to them. Like someone turned off the faucet and walked away with the key.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t offer platitudes. Just nodded slowly. “Maybe you don’t need the key.”</p><p>Rio arched a brow. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Maybe it’s not about forcing the stories out. Maybe it’s about letting something in.”</p><p>There was a beat of quiet. Rio looked at her more closely then, something shifting behind her eyes.</p><p>“You’re a strange one, Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>“I’ve been called worse,” Agatha replied lightly, but the smile that followed was a real one. Tired at the edges, a little wistful—but real.</p><p>They finished the fries, talking around the edges of themselves. Rio learned Agatha had grown up in Thistle Grove but didn’t volunteer much else. She asked if Rio had seen the lake yet and mentioned a bakery that sold the best honey cake in the state. Her voice was low and even, easy to fall into.</p><p>By the time they parted ways, the sky outside had gone velvet-dark and the cold had sharpened. Agatha walked her to the door, her hand brushing lightly against Rio’s as she reached for the handle.</p><p>“Careful on the roads,” she said. “The ice likes to sneak up on you.”</p><p>Rio’s breath fogged in the air as she turned to look at her. “Thanks for the fries. And the mystery advice.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved. “You’re very welcome.”</p><p>And just like that, Rio stepped out into the cold, her heart knocking a little faster in her chest and the stories in her head stirring for the first time in weeks.</p><p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha watched the door swing closed behind Rio, the little brass bell above it giving a single, lonely jingle.</p><p>She stood there for a long beat, eyes still fixed on the empty space where Rio had just been. The air still held her warmth. That strange tug she’d been trying to ignore all week was louder now, humming just under her skin.</p><p>It wasn’t just that Rio was beautiful. (She was—<em> aggravatingly so</em>, in that sun-warmed, California way that Agatha couldn’t help but be incredibly attracted to.) It was something else. Something deeper. A sense of being recognized. Of being seen. And that was what unsettled her.</p><p>She shook it off, retreating to her booth and picking up her glass. The drink was too sweet, but she sipped it anyway. She leaned back in the booth, exhaling slow and steady. Wanda had been right about one thing—there was no denying that the Threads were stirring again. She felt it in her bones, that old, dangerous magic, curling up from the depths like smoke through floorboards.</p><p>She had buried it for nearly two decades. Packed it down like ash, sealed the cracks. And now—</p><p>Now a woman with warm hazel eyes and a sketchpad had walked into her town, into Eliza’s house, and without even knowing it, cracked everything open again.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes for a moment, trying to will the world quiet. But it wasn’t quiet. Not anymore.</p><p>The Thread in her was humming.</p><p>And Agatha Harkness, for the first time in twenty years, didn’t know what came next.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The house Agatha lived in sat on the northern edge of Thistle Grove, tucked into a thicket of bare-limbed trees and ivy-covered stone. It wasn’t large, but it was old, older than anyone remembered, and it creaked with history in the same way she did—soft, constant, and just under the surface.</p><p>The morning was overcast, the kind of gray that made everything look muted and tired. Agatha didn’t light the lamps. She liked the way the light sifted through the cloudy windows today, low and dim. Quiet.</p><p>She stood in the living room, her fingers curled around a chipped ceramic mug. The tea inside had gone cold, untouched.</p><p>On the mantle above the old fireplace, tucked between bundles of dried herbs and a few odd talismans, sat a small silver-framed photo. A boy with dark curls and laughing eyes, mid-spin in a blur of motion, his shirt half-untucked like he’d never stayed still long enough for anyone to fix it.</p><p>Nicky.</p><p>Today would have been his eighteenth birthday.</p><p>Agatha sat slowly on the worn velvet settee across from the hearth, knees stiff, breath tight in her chest. She’d woken with the ache already inside her, a hollow, bruised place she tried not to touch most days. But not today. Today it howled. Today it felt like a gaping, bleeding wound.</p><p>She let her head fall back against the cushion and closed her eyes.</p><p>He would’ve been tall by now. His warm brown eyes would probably be the same, though. Always so full of mischief, so full of love. </p><p>He would’ve had too much magic in his blood, too much curiosity for his own good. She would’ve taught him everything—how to ground himself, how to weave intention into spellwork, how to build protections so strong no one could hurt him.</p><p>But that wasn’t the story the world had written for her. How unfair was it that the one person she needed to heal, she couldn’t? What good was it to have a healing power when it wouldn’t work on your own flesh and blood?</p><p>She’d buried him on a bitter winter morning, the earth too hard and the sky too quiet. Wanda had held her up when her knees gave out. Lilia had come every night for weeks with broth and silence. And Agatha had decided—right there, right then—that she would never let herself love anything like that again.</p><p>Her mother had vanished when Agatha was just a girl. No body. No answers. Just a trail of ash and whispers. And then Nicky, stolen from her before he’d even had a chance to become the person he was meant to be.</p><p>She had lost too much to ever risk that again.</p><p>Even now, after all these years, the weight of it made her feel like she couldn’t breathe.</p><p>She glanced toward the window.</p><p>Somewhere out there, Rio Vidal was walking around with curious eyes and a stubborn streak a mile wide. Drawing in that sketchbook like she could capture the world with charcoal and paper. Stirring things Agatha had worked hard to bury.</p><p>No. She couldn’t afford to let anyone in. Especially not someone like her.</p><p>Not when the magic was waking up again.</p><p>Not when the Threads were calling.</p><p>And definitely not when Agatha still hadn’t forgiven the world for taking everything she loved.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The care package arrived just after noon.</p><p>Agatha didn’t hear anyone at the door—Wanda never knocked—but when she wandered back into the front room, there it was on the stoop. A brown paper bag folded neatly at the top, sealed with a red wax stamp. Wanda’s seal. The flaming phoenix.</p><p>Agatha sighed, her chest tightening. She picked it up gently, the scent of rosemary and sweet clove already wafting through the paper. Inside, she found a small container of butternut squash soup—Wanda’s best—still warm to the touch, a crusty roll wrapped in a cloth napkin, and a tin of cinnamon shortbread cookies, hand-cut into little stars. Tucked between the napkin and the tin was a note.</p><p>
<em> Thinking of you. If you want company today, you don’t have to ask. I’ll come running. But if you want quiet, I get it. You know where to find me. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Love always, </em>
</p><p>
<em> W </em>
</p><p>Agatha’s throat closed up. She set the bag on the counter without opening anything. She wasn’t ready to eat. Wasn’t ready to sit and feel Wanda’s kindness seep into the cracks of her armor.</p><p>Not today.</p><p>She changed into her thick gray sweater—the one Nicky used to burrow into when he was small—and pulled on a long black coat, a pair of gloves, and a scarf she didn’t remember knitting but had kept anyway. Her boots crunched on the frost-tipped leaves as she stepped out into the stillness.</p><p>The walk behind the Vidal cottage was mostly forest, quiet and untouched. A narrow path wound down to the lake, barely wide enough for one person, flanked by ferns and gnarled roots. Agatha had been coming here for decades—since long before Eliza Vidal had passed. Eliza had never minded. In fact, she’d encouraged it.</p><p>“You’re the only Harkness who doesn’t scare the trees,” Eliza had said once with a wink, pouring Agatha a cup of something herbal and sharp. “That lake knows you.”</p><p>Maybe it did. It was the only place in Thistle Grove that had ever felt like it knew her.</p><p>The water shimmered in the low light, dark and glassy. A rim of ice had started forming along the edge. Agatha walked to the old dock, its wooden slats slick with frost, and lowered herself to sit at the end of it, legs crossed beneath her.</p><p>No spells today.</p><p>No grief rituals or burning herbs.</p><p>Just silence.</p><p>Just her.</p><p>The wind stirred the trees gently, and the lake rippled in response. Somewhere across the water, a bird cried out once and then went quiet again.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes.</p><p>“I miss you, baby,” she whispered. Her voice barely broke the air.</p><p>It had been twelve years since Nicky died. And yet, on days like this, the pain was fresh and sharp. Like he’d only just left. Like she’d find his toy broomstick leaning against the wall, or his little hand in hers as they walked through town on a cold day like this.</p><p>He would’ve been so brilliant. So full of life and questions. A powerful witch, no doubt. A good one, if she’d done her job right.</p><p>But she hadn’t been able to protect him. Not from illness. Not from the magic that ran too hot in his blood too young.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head back, staring up at the pale, colorless sky. The ache in her chest burned like coals.</p><p>She didn’t need comfort. She didn’t need soup or cookies or Wanda’s fierce, smothering love.</p><p>She needed this.</p><p>Stillness. Solitude. The lake. The memory of a laugh now long gone.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Agatha felt her before she saw her.</p><p>Soft, uncertain footsteps—hesitant on the frost-slick path—and for a moment she thought that maybe it was Wanda after all, deciding solitude be damned. But then a voice, light and a little winded, broke the quiet, confirming what she already knew deep inside.</p><p>“Wasn’t sure if I needed to chase someone off,” Rio said. “Saw a lone figure sitting on my dock and figured I should come investigate.”</p><p>Agatha stiffened, swiping quickly at her cheeks with the backs of her gloved hands. Too late. She knew the shimmer in her eyes hadn’t gone unnoticed.</p><p>She turned her head just enough to see Rio stepping onto the dock, hands in the pockets of a worn coat, cheeks flushed from the cold. There was no mockery in her expression. No smugness in the I-caught-you look Agatha had expected.</p><p>Only concern. And softness.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio said quickly, stopping a few paces away. “I didn’t mean to intrude.”</p><p>Agatha looked back out at the lake, breath misting in front of her. “You’re not. I’m the one trespassing.”</p><p>Rio stepped closer, cautiously lowering herself onto the edge of the dock beside her. The wood creaked, but held. “Didn’t realize this place had such a view.”</p><p>“It’s always been one of the best parts of the property,” Agatha murmured. Her voice sounded hollow, even to her own ears. “Eliza used to say the lake kept secrets better than anyone else in town.”</p><p>Rio was quiet for a moment, just breathing. Then: “You okay?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated. Lying was easier. Always had been.</p><p>But something about the question—simple, not prying—got under her ribs.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she said finally.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, studying her profile. “You don’t look fine.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a breath. Not quite a laugh, not quite a sigh. “Don’t you have internet now? Things to do, people to text?”</p><p>Rio gave her a look. “You’re deflecting.”</p><p>“And you’re prying.”</p><p>“I’m… observing,” Rio corrected gently, then glanced out at the water. “Didn’t mean to interrupt anything. It just—felt weird seeing someone out here. This still.”</p><p>Agatha let the silence stretch between them. The lake lapped quietly against the shore, ice ringing gently against rock.</p><p>“My son would’ve been eighteen today,” she said, so softly she almost didn’t hear herself.</p><p>Rio’s head turned toward her sharply, her expression folding into something stunned and stricken. “Oh,” she said. Just that one word, small and reverent. “Agatha, I’m—”</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha cut in, voice sharper than intended. But then she sighed and softened. “I don’t talk about him. Hardly ever. No one really asks anymore.”</p><p>Rio didn’t press. She just reached into her coat pocket, pulled out a small, crumpled packet of tissues, and set it beside her on the dock.</p><p>“I brought these because my nose always runs in the cold,” she said, not looking at her. “Not… because I expected this.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the offering for a moment before picking one out and dabbing gently at her eyes. “Thanks.”</p><p>They sat quietly again, the winter wind brushing over them, gentle and respectful.</p><p>After a while, Rio asked, “Do you want to tell me about him?”</p><p>Agatha was surprised to find herself nodding. “His name was Nicky. Nicholas.”</p><p>Rio smiled, just a little. “That’s a good name.”</p><p>Agatha looked out at the lake again. “Yeah. It really was,” she sighed, and was silent for a few beats. “He was mine,” she said, voice quiet. “My son.”</p><p>Rio didn’t speak right away, just shifted to sit beside her, close but not crowding. She waited, the kind of patience that felt like permission.</p><p>“He was six when he died.” Agatha’s words were precise, controlled—like saying it without emotion would make it less real. “It was… sudden. An illness that took too much too fast. One day he was running around barefoot in the garden, chasing bees. The next—”</p><p>She stopped. A breath caught in her throat. She hated this part. Hated that it still unraveled her no matter how many times she tried to fold it away.</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” Rio said, and the warmth in her voice undid something in Agatha. “That’s… there’s nothing I can say that makes that better. But I’m here.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed and looked away, but not before she caught something in Rio’s eyes. Not pity. Recognition. Loss, too. Maybe not the same shape, but it echoed.</p><p>“Eliza helped me with him, back then,” Agatha said after a beat, her voice softer now. “She was… kind. Stern as hell, but kind. Nicky adored her. She used to bring him jars of wildflower honey and make him little charms to keep nightmares away.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly.  </p><p>“She meant a lot to this town, you know?” Agatha said. “And to me.”</p><p>A breeze stirred the lake, and with it, the faint scent of jasmine and lavender—impossible, Agatha thought, in November. She turned her head.</p><p>The dock was framed by tiny blossoms, peeking up through frost-laced grass. Wildflowers, pale and delicate, blooming as if they’d forgotten the season.</p><p>Agatha stilled.</p><p>Rio didn’t seem to notice. She was smiling softly, tucking her hair behind her ear as she looked out over the lake.</p><p>“Strange,” she murmured. “I don’t remember there being flowers here yesterday.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her. The way the light curved toward her. The way the earth responded to her joy.</p><p>No. Not strange. Not at all.</p><p>“I should go,” Agatha said, carefully neutral, her chest feeling tight all of a sudden. “It’s getting cold.”</p><p>Rio blinked, startled. “Right, yeah. Of course.”</p><p>But her expression shifted as she studied Agatha’s face. “Hey, thank you. For telling me about Nicky.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once. “Thanks for listening.”</p><p>Rio stood, and turned toward Agatha with a soft but confident smile. She extended her hand, fingers curling slightly as if offering something delicate, like an invitation to step into something warmer.</p><p>“Need a hand?” she asked, her voice quiet, but with an edge of playfulness.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. For a split second, she considered refusing. She was fine, she didn’t need anyone’s help. But then Rio’s eyes—the ones that had softened in that way she couldn’t quite explain—locked with hers, and something in Agatha relented.</p><p>She reached out, just as Rio’s fingers brushed against hers.</p><p>The moment their hands met, a strange warmth bloomed inside her, deep and untapped. It was as though something had sparked to life in the air around them. And then, in a surreal cascade, the ground beneath them—frosted and barren just moments ago—suddenly stirred with movement.</p><p>In a sudden burst, tiny white flowers bloomed all around them, as if the earth had been waiting for this touch to awaken it. A soft, glowing burst of color stretched over the ground, delicate petals unfurling in the cold air, a brilliant contrast to the otherwise muted winter landscape.</p><p>Agatha froze, her breath hitching.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, watching as the flowers bloomed in a rapid, almost unnatural fashion, their petals white as snow, glistening with the fresh promise of spring.</p><p>“What the hell…?” Agatha murmured, staring at the ground as the flowers spread like an enchanted carpet beneath them.</p><p>Rio blinked, her hand still resting in Agatha’s. She glanced down at the flowers, then up at Agatha, as if trying to gauge her reaction.</p><p>“What the hell just happened?” Rio looked around incredulously.</p><p>Agatha was still staring at the flowers, her pulse quickening in her veins. She’d seen magic before, but this… this wasn’t ordinary. The way the world seemed to respond to Rio—this wasn’t normal.</p><p>“I, uh,” Agatha started, not quite knowing what to say. “I don’t know.”</p><p>Rio seemed to notice the shift in Agatha’s tone, and she glanced at her more closely. “You sure about that?”</p><p>Agatha’s thoughts swirled with an unsettling clarity. Could it be…? No. That wasn’t possible. Was it?</p><p>She let out a breath, shaking her head. “Never mind,” she muttered. “Coffee?”</p><p>Rio smiled, though the curiosity in her eyes lingered, clearly unsettled by the sudden change of subject and how it reflected in Agatha’s demeanor.</p><p>“Yeah. Let’s get coffee.”</p><p>Agatha followed Rio inside, blinking against the warmth of the little cottage. The scent of cinnamon and cedar clung to the air—homey and unexpectedly comforting. She hadn’t stepped foot inside this house since Eliza’s memorial. It looked different now, of course. Lived in again. With Rio’s own flare to it. But something about it still felt untouched, preserved beneath the surface.</p><p>“Go ahead and make yourself at home,” Rio said, shrugging off her coat and hanging it by the door. “I’ll get the coffee going. I finally figured out the ancient machine yesterday.”</p><p>Agatha let out a faint breath of amusement and made her way to the small kitchen table by the window. She ran a hand over the back of the wooden chair before settling into it. The cottage was small, yes, but cozy in a way that made her chest ache. It wasn’t just the memories—it was something else, something new.</p><p>The kettle began to rumble on the stove as Rio moved around the kitchen with a kind of distracted grace. She poured the hot water into a French press and pressed it down slowly, carefully, before bringing over two mismatched mugs. She set one in front of Agatha, then slid into the seat across from her.</p><p>“Careful, it’s hot,” Rio said, wrapping her hands around her own mug. “And probably too strong. I never said I was good at this.”</p><p>Agatha curled her hands around the warm ceramic, letting the heat soak into her fingers. “Strong is fine,” she murmured, watching Rio over the rim of her cup.</p><p>They sat in silence for a beat. The wind murmured outside, brushing against the windows, and Rio’s coffee cup made a soft tap as she set it down on the table between them.</p><p>Then, with quiet steadiness, Rio leaned forward, elbows on her knees, hands wrapped loosely around the warm mug. “So,” she said, her voice low, “are you going to tell me what that was?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze stayed on her coffee. She didn’t answer right away. Just took a sip, as if the heat might settle the sudden churn in her chest. It didn’t.</p><p>“I don’t know,” she said finally. Her voice was soft, but careful. “Not everything has an easy explanation.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “But it has one, though.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at her, surprised by the calm in her tone. There was no pressure, no suspicion—just curiosity. Maybe even something like patience.</p><p>“It wasn’t supposed to happen,” Agatha said after a long pause. “The flowers.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, glancing out the window. Frost still rimmed the glass, but outside, the garden shimmered faintly with color. “Kinda figured wildflowers don’t usually show up after the first snow.”</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet laugh—dry and faintly bitter. “No. They don’t.”</p><p>They fell quiet again. The space between them felt charged now. Not tense, exactly—but full. Like something unsaid was hanging just above the table, waiting.</p><p>Rio looked back at her. “Look, I know today is a hard day for you. I don’t need you to explain it. Not right now. But I know you know more than you’re letting on and I want to know what the hell that was,” She paused, then added, “But I just… I saw you out there. You looked like you were carrying something heavy. I just… wanted to make sure you were okay.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened around her mug. Her throat felt tight again. “You weren’t intruding,” she said before she could think better of it.</p><p>Rio’s smile came slow and lopsided. “Good,” she said. </p><p>Agatha looked up at her—really looked. The tousled curls, the little smudge of ink on her thumb, the quiet steadiness in her eyes. She hadn’t expected any of this. Not the garden. Not the warmth. Not Rio. Not such powerful, ancient magic tangled with hers.</p><p>“Thanks for the coffee,” she said. And though it was simple, the words landed heavy. Meant more than they should.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. She just reached across the table and set her hand gently over Agatha’s.</p><p>It was a small thing. Light pressure. Warm skin.</p><p>But the second their palms met, something moved. A soft hum in Agatha’s chest, like a chord being struck. Outside, the frost-bitten garden brightened again—color breaking through the snow-dusted ground. Tiny blossoms unfurled, reaching for the gray light.</p><p>And then a beautiful white daisy appeared on the coffee table in front of them.</p><p>Agatha froze. Breath caught.</p><p>Rio’s hand stayed steady in hers, thumb brushing lightly against her knuckles.</p><p>Neither of them said a word. They didn’t need to.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze flicked to the window, heart hammering. It was beautiful. Too beautiful. And too familiar in a way that shook her.</p><p>She’d buried this. Locked it away.</p><p>And now here it was—breaking through the frost, wild and impossible.</p><p>Rio’s eyes stayed fixed on the coffee table, on the impossible flower that just appeared there, her lips parted just slightly. “This is…” she whispered, then blinked, stunned. “This is impossible.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t move. Her hand still rested under Rio’s, but her body had gone very still.</p><p>Tiny blue blossoms trembled in the cold breeze outside, petals delicate and defiant against the frost. And Rio looked at them like they were a miracle.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t take it.</p><p>She pulled her hand back gently, stood too quickly, the chair scraping against the floor. “I—I need to go.”</p><p>Rio turned, startled. “Wait—what?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, already moving toward the door, the walls feeling too close, her skin too tight. Her magic buzzed just beneath the surface, wild and unchecked, like it was trying to claw its way out.</p><p>“I just—thank you. For the coffee,” she said again, but this time her voice was strained. Hollow.</p><p>Rio stood too, confused and concerned. “Agatha, hey, wait. What’s going on? Is it something I did?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said sharply, too quickly. Then, softer, “No. It’s not you. It’s me. I just… I can’t—”</p><p>She stopped herself before she said too much.</p><p>Before she said I can’t fall into this again. I can’t feel this much again.</p><p>Outside, another blossom pushed through the frost. A dandelion this time. Bold. Unapologetic.</p><p>She couldn’t bear it.</p><p>Agatha opened the door and stepped into the cold, barely feeling it. The wind cut through her coat, but it didn’t matter. The magic in her veins was louder than her thoughts, running wild under her skin.</p><p>She didn’t look back.</p><p>But Rio stood at the threshold, heart pounding, watching her go—and wondering what the hell had just bloomed between them.</p><p> </p>

<p>
<span>The door clicked shut behind her, and the warmth she’d brought with her seemed to vanish just as quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood there for a moment, unmoving, coffee mug in hand and heart thudding a little too hard in her chest. Her eyes drifted to the window, where the faintest outlines of flowers still shimmered in the frost-edged glass, their petals soft and defiantly alive against the November cold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What the hell had that been?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d seen weird things before—living in LA meant running into the occasional eccentric psychic or auras reader who swore her energy was “rare”—but this?</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was something else entirely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had started the moment they touched. The warmth, the spark, that strange hum in her bones like the world had briefly gone into tune around her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Was it Agatha?</span>
</p><p>
<span>No, she didn’t think so. Not just her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something had stirred in Rio too. Something deep and strange and inexplicably real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She ran a hand through her hair and sighed, setting her mug down. “I’ve officially lost it,” she muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she didn’t feel lost. If anything, she felt sharper than she had in months.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Alive</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The days bled together in a quiet rhythm—soft light through lace curtains, the scratch of pencil on paper, the slow return of something Rio hadn’t felt in months: inspiration. It crept in gradually, like a shy animal testing the air, but it was there. Real. Tangible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By Friday, her fingers itched if she went too long without a pencil in hand. Her sketchbook was starting to fill again—not with polished panels or tight layouts, but raw, alive sketches. Character faces. Dreamlike landscapes. A girl standing at the edge of a lake with flowers blooming around her feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t have to ask who the girl was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was early afternoon when she ducked into The Hollow again, drawn by the promise of warmth and the ever-elusive lure of decent Wi-Fi and some hot tea. The little diner was quieter than usual. A few locals lingered over mugs of something strong and sweet, but none paid her any mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She slid into her usual corner booth and ordered a cinnamon tea from the disinterested teenage server who’d clearly rather be anywhere else. Then she opened her sketchbook and fell in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Time passed. She didn’t notice the light starting to fade, didn’t notice the hush deepening in the diner—until the bell above the door rang.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced up automatically.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And there she was again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness, wrapped in a deep charcoal coat that suited her perfectly, the wind still clinging to her hair like it didn’t want to let go. Beside her was a tall teen with smudged eyeliner, a punk band tee, and a mouth already mid-rant about something that had probably started ten minutes before they walked in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was murmuring something to him—probably a well-placed jab if her expression was anything to go by—but the teen didn’t seem fazed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He was halfway through another sentence when his eyes landed on Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he stopped cold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god,” he said, pointing right at her, eyes wide. “No way. You’re her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “Me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kid practically bounded over, starstruck. “You’re Rio Vidal. Like, </span>
<em>
<span>the</span>
</em>
<span> Rio Vidal. Creator of Ink &amp; Thorn, Orbit City, and don’t even get me started on Bitter Honey—do you understand what that book did to me in junior high? I cried. Like, actual sobbing. In the library. People thought someone had died.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, startled and genuinely flattered. “I… wow. Thank you. That’s really sweet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have all your books. Hardcover. Signed editions when I could find them. My mom thinks I have a shrine, and honestly, she’s not wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, already at the counter, let out a low sigh. “Billy, breathe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy waved her off, still beaming at Rio like she’d descended from the heavens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You saved me. No exaggeration. I was, like, thirteen, gay, miserable. And then I found your work and—boom. There was someone out there who got it. Who didn’t make queer stories about suffering or tragedy, but about magic and love and messy, gorgeous life. You gave me something. I don’t know what my teens would’ve been like if I hadn’t found your work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flushed, caught between embarrassment and the kind of gratitude that leaves you a little breathless. “Wow,” she said again. “I don’t know what to say. I think that’s one of the nicest things anyone’s ever said to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha returned then, two mugs in hand. “He’s still a teenager, in case you couldn’t tell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy stuck his tongue out at her but didn’t miss a beat. “He’s a teenager who’s just met his idol. Show some respect, Aunt Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bit back a grin and looked up at her. “You two always like this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Unfortunately,” Agatha said, her tone dry but not unkind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We live to torment each other,” Billy said proudly. “It’s a sacred pact.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a sip of her tea, the warmth blooming through her chest as she looked between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, she felt… anchored. Like she’d stumbled into something real in this strange little town. Something unexpected. Something—she wasn’t sure yet. But it was good.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes met Agatha’s across the table, and something unspoken passed between them. Not quite a smile, but something warmer. Softer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Familiar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back a little, pushing her sketchbook aside just enough that it caught Billy’s eye again. His gasp was so dramatic she nearly dropped her tea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that your current work? Oh my god—may I?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled. “Be my guest.” She slid the sketchbook toward him. “It’s mostly messy stuff. Just warming up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy sat without waiting to be asked, flipping through the pages like they were sacred texts. “Messy? Girl, this is </span>
<em>
<span>divine</span>
</em>
<span>. Look at the linework—do you see this? Aunt Agatha, look at this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow but lowered herself gracefully into the booth beside Billy, her own mug cradled in her hands. “I’ve seen her work,” she said, giving Rio a sly look. “But I suppose I wouldn’t mind another peek.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt heat rise in her cheeks, caught somewhere between pleased and self-conscious. It was one thing to have a teenage fanboy over you—it was another to have Agatha Harkness, who carried herself like a secret wrapped in velvet, staring down at her drawings like they held something meaningful. Especially after everything that had happened the last time they’d seen each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy flipped to the lake sketch. The one with the two figures on the dock—one seated, hunched, a shadow of grief wrapped around her; the other standing just behind her, hand outstretched, offering something unseen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” he said, quieter now. “This one…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was quiet too. Rio watched as her eyes settled on the page and didn’t move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cleared her throat. “That was just… a moment that stuck with me. From earlier this week.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve got a good eye for people,” Billy murmured. “The way you catch emotion in stillness… I don’t even have words. It’s like—like your characters breathe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze slid from the sketchbook to Rio, thoughtful. “Your creative block seems to be well and truly broken.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, but there was a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. “Yeah, I guess so. It’s weird. Ever since I got here, it’s like… something cracked open. Not all at once. But I feel like I’m finally remembering what it feels like to want to create again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head slightly, her voice softer than Rio had expected. “Maybe this place is exactly where you’re meant to be right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio met her gaze and something in her chest pulled tight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It would’ve been easy to dismiss the words as small talk. Polite encouragement. But there was a weight behind them. Like Agatha had felt it too—that strange, invisible thread weaving between them since the moment they met.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy was still flipping through her pages in reverent silence, and for a little while, the three of them just sat there—warm tea, warm light, and the soft scratch of pages turning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked around the diner, at the sleepy golden afternoon pouring through the windows. The world beyond the glass was cold and brittle, late November settling deep into the bones of the town. But here, inside this booth, with Billy’s laughter and Agatha’s quiet eyes on her sketchbook, it almost felt like spring again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The conversation over tea had drifted from art to books to the quirks of small-town life, and Rio found herself laughing more than she had in weeks. Billy was funny and endearing, and Agatha—well, Agatha didn’t say much, but when she did, her dry wit landed with perfect timing, and her eyes sparkled like she was far more entertained than she let on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The tea had long gone cold in Rio’s mug by the time she checked her phone and blinked at the hour.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit,” she muttered. “It’s already seven?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy’s eyes widened in mock horror. “Time flies when you’re drinking Lilia’s suspiciously strong black currant brew.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, standing to gather her sketchbook and coat. “I should head back before it gets any darker. My boots are great for wandering town, not so much for stomping through icy leaves in the dark”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy stretched and slung his scarf over one shoulder. “I’m off too. I’ve got a thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “A ‘thing’?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He gave her a sly grin. “A date, maybe. Or possibly just someone who appreciates eyeliner and sarcasm. Either way, I’m intrigued.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head but said nothing, though there was the faintest tug of a smile on her lips as she watched him go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the door jingled closed behind him, the silence between them settled differently—heavier, maybe, but not uncomfortable. Rio hesitated, her coat slung over her arm, unsure if she should bolt or stay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha broke the quiet first. “He adores you, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced toward the door, bemused. “Billy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft huff of amusement. “He doesn’t like many people. Especially not enough to sit still and drink tea with them for over an hour.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“High praise,” Rio murmured, then added, “He’s great. I can see why you keep him around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged. “He keeps showing up. I haven’t found a way to stop him yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That made Rio laugh again, the sound surprising even to her. When she looked back at Agatha, the other woman was already watching her. The firelight made her features softer, gentler, and yet that same quiet gravity lingered in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cleared her throat, nerves fluttering in her chest. “Well, I should go. Thanks for the tea and the company.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “Be careful on your drive back. The frost’s already setting in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll manage.” But as she reached for the door, she paused. “Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hm?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned slightly. “It was… really good seeing you again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head just a bit. “You say that like you weren’t planning on it,” she teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips curved. “I wasn’t sure if you were the type who planned things.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back in her chair, fingers still curled around her teacup. “I’m not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their eyes met again. Something passed between them—unspoken but not unfelt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a small nod, then pushed out into the chill, the warmth of the diner clinging to her skin like a memory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused just outside the door, hand resting on the old wooden frame as she glanced up at the sky. The light had shifted while they’d been inside—what had been soft overcast now darkened to something more ominous. Heavy clouds rolled low across the sky, thick and bruised-looking, like they were debating a downpour or worse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned halfway, looking back into the diner where Agatha still sat, the soft amber glow of the table lamp catching in the sharp lines of her profile. She looked thoughtful—or maybe just tired—and Rio hesitated, her hand tightening around her keys.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” she said, stepping back in. “It’s looking like it might storm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced out the window, her brow lifting slightly as she noted the sky. “Mm. Wouldn’t be the first time the weather’s turned without warning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I could give you a ride,” Rio offered, trying to make it sound casual. “I mean, if you’re walking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a flicker of something unreadable across Agatha’s face. Surprise, maybe. Or suspicion softened by something gentler. She studied Rio for a long second, like she was trying to see the motive under the words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to,” she said quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Rio replied, just as soft. “But I want to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another beat of silence stretched between them. Then, finally, Agatha stood, slow and deliberate. She pulled on her coat, buttoning it at the collar, and met Rio’s gaze with a hint of a wry smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well. If I get struck by lightning, I suppose I’d rather it be in your company.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Wow, high praise again. Twice in one evening.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes as she stepped past her, the door swinging open with a soft creak. “You’re starting to sound like Billy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll take that as a compliment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Outside, the wind had picked up, sharp and damp with the promise of rain. Rio unlocked her car, and for a fleeting moment as Agatha slid into the passenger seat, it felt oddly like something… normal. Not charged with magic or heavy with grief or mystery.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just two women, trying to get out of the storm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And for a little while, that was enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>They turned off the main road, the cottage-lined stretch growing narrower and darker as the trees thickened. The storm was creeping in fast now—wind whistling through the leaves, rain beginning to speckle more steadily against the windshield.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stole a glance at Agatha, who hadn’t said much since they’d left the diner. She sat with one hand resting on the window ledge, fingers occasionally twitching, like she was thinking hard but trying not to show it. Her face, usually so composed, looked softer in the quiet—tired maybe, or thoughtful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you always this broody after tea?” Rio asked lightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a small huff of a laugh, the kind that barely escaped her lips. “Only when I’ve had too much honey.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled at that, but didn’t press. There was something fragile about the moment—delicate, like glass that hadn’t shattered yet but could if touched too firmly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They pulled up to Agatha’s place a minute later: a dark, ivy-covered home set back from the road with a wrought-iron gate and flickering lanterns casting long shadows across the porch. It looked like something out of an old storybook, regal and a little lonely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved to unbuckle her seatbelt but paused, her hand still on the strap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t have to do this,” she said softly. “Drive me, I mean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her, something warm stirring behind her ribs. “It was no trouble. And I wanted to. I kinda like you, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips curved into something almost-smile. She opened the door, rain brushing her face as the wind tugged at her coat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hesitated. Just long enough that Rio noticed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, softly—almost too quiet to hear over the rain—Agatha said, “Be careful with this place, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowned, turning in her seat. “You’ve said that before. What does that mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked back at her, eyes unreadable in the dark.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It means Thistle Grove gives you what you need… but it rarely asks if you’re ready for it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with that, she stepped out into the night, pulling the door shut behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat there a moment longer, watching the curve of Agatha’s back as she walked up the stone path, dark curls whipped by the wind. A light flicked on inside the house just as the rain began to fall harder, steady now, like a quiet percussion against the car roof.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That strange ache behind her ribs tightened, just for a second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she turned the car around, heading back through the winding road toward her own cottage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t know what she was getting herself into here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she was starting to suspect Agatha Harkness wasn’t just a local with sharp eyes and sharper words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She might’ve been a storm in disguise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio replayed Agatha’s words over and over as she drove, windshield wipers working overtime against the curtain of rain. </span>
<em>
<span>Be careful with this place, Rio.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The hell was that supposed to mean?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned the question around in her head, prodding it like a sore tooth. Was it about Thistle Grove in general? The weird vibe, the kooky and weirdly specific shopkeepers, the flowers that bloomed out of season? Or was it something else—something Agatha had seen in her? Or maybe felt?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The storm answered her thoughts with a crack of thunder that rattled her windows. She jumped slightly, her hands tightening around the steering wheel as her little car veered slightly over the slick road.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she muttered, brow furrowing. “That’s enough melodrama for one night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But it wasn’t. The storm only seemed to build the more her mind spiraled—gale winds shaking the trees, lightning forking across the sky like Mother nature herself was throwing a temper tantrum.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She finally pulled into the gravel clearing by her cottage, headlights cutting through the mist just enough to see the sagging outline of the front porch. The steps still groaned in protest from when she’d first arrived, and the whole thing looked more waterlogged than ever. She cursed under her breath, cutting the engine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fix the porch,” she told herself aloud. “Seriously. Fix. The damn. Porch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She grabbed her bag and bolted for the door, hunched against the downpour. Her boots splashed through puddles, and cold rain instantly soaked through her jeans and jacket. One of the wooden boards on the top step shifted under her weight with a loud crack that made her stomach lurch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit,” she hissed, fumbling for her keys.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thunder split the sky again, and she could’ve sworn it sounded like a growl. Not a rumble, but something sharp and angry. It echoed through the woods like it had teeth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The key jammed in the lock. “Come on, come on, come—</span>
<em>
<span>yes</span>
</em>
<span>,” she muttered in triumph as it finally gave way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stumbled inside, dripping wet and shivering, her pulse thudding somewhere behind her ears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door slammed shut behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The cottage welcomed her with creaks and a familiar warmth, her now-functional space heater humming in the corner. She kicked off her boots, wiped her face with the sleeve of her coat, and dropped her bag with a thud. Her sketchbook had gotten a little wet despite her best efforts—edges curling like they were protesting the weather too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She crossed to the window and looked back out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>All she could see was black, the kind that swallowed the trees and erased the hills. The lake was hidden beyond that, but she could almost feel it—still and watchful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And for a split second… she thought she saw a flicker of movement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just there. At the edge of the trees. A figure? No, just a shadow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Probably.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She drew the curtain shut, wrapping her arms around herself as another roll of thunder trembled through the house.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Be careful with this place, Rio.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah. No kidding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She lit a fire. She made tea. She toweled off and changed into dry clothes. But the storm didn’t let up, and neither did the hum under her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The storm had passed, but its ghost still lingered in the dew-slick grass and heavy gray sky outside the morning after. The world felt quieter in its aftermath, like it was holding its breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat at her kitchen table, fingers smudged with pencil dust, her second mug of coffee going cold beside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sketch in front of her was almost complete. A cat—not any cat she recognized, but one that had shown up, sharp and vivid in her mind the moment she opened her eyes that morning. Sleek and dark-furred, with intelligent eyes and an alert posture, like it was on the verge of speaking. Or casting a spell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She furrowed her brow, adding delicate detail to its whiskers. Had she dreamt about it? She couldn’t remember. All she knew was that something—someone—had insisted on being drawn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t even question it. Just padded out of bed, tossed on an old sweatshirt, made coffee, and reached for her sketchpad. The most natural thing in the world. Which was strange, considering how unnatural everything else had felt lately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She blew gently on the page, brushing away a few stray pencil shavings, and looked at the cat again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It stared back at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not in the literal sense—she wasn’t </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>far gone—but something about the expression she’d given it unnerved her. There was a knowing there. Like the cat knew secrets it had no business knowing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced out the window. The lake was still veiled in mist, a pale sheet of it curling over the water. Beyond that, the dock was empty. No dark figures. No visitors. Just silence and fog.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back in her chair, rubbing her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>First, flowers blooming at her feet. Then storms that seemed to follow her mood. Now… prophetic cat drawings?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is this place,” she muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t have an answer. But the strange part wasn’t how weird it all felt—it was how right it did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like some small, quiet part of her recognized it all. Like she was finally slipping into something that had been waiting for her all along.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stared at the cat a little longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she picked up her pen and gave it a name.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Salem</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because of course.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled on her jacket and boots, sketchbook still open on the table behind her, the freshly drawn cat watching her with those vivid green eyes she couldn’t shake. She shook her head, grabbing her keys and grocery list, already half-lost in thoughts of what the town’s tiny market might or might not have in stock.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She opened the door—and froze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A cat sat on her porch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gray fur. Silky and sleek, despite the cold. Eyes the color of deep moss or spring leaves, sharp and knowing. It tilted its head at her, as if in greeting—or judgment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. Hard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have got to be kidding me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The cat blinked back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the same cat. The exact same cat she’d drawn less than an hour ago.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could say anything else, it rose gracefully to its feet, padded past her ankles like it owned the place, and strolled inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey—wait a second,” Rio stammered, turning to watch it as it sauntered toward the table, tail flicking. It jumped onto a chair, curled into a neat ball beside her sketchbook, and rested its chin on one paw.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped inside slowly, shutting the door behind her as if she might spook it. Or maybe herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the hell is going on?” she muttered, staring at the feline intruder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The cat yawned, eyes half-lidded, completely at home. Like it had been here before. Like it belonged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio said slowly, running a hand through her hair. “Either I’m losing it, or this town is weirder than I thought.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The cat didn’t argue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, it purred.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Low. Warm. Like it had been waiting for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio crouched down slowly, her eyes scanning the cat’s slender frame. He wasn’t alarmingly thin, but there was a certain gauntness to his ribs, a hollowness around his flanks that made her chest tighten with something she didn’t want to name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She rubbed her palm against her jeans. “You haven’t eaten in a while, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The cat didn’t answer, of course, but he looked up at her with those vivid green eyes—steady, ancient, almost like he could.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t even have a can of tuna,” she muttered, standing with a sigh and heading toward the kitchen. “You want eggs? That’s a thing cats eat, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She scrambled a couple in a pan with the kind of care she didn’t usually apply to her own meals. When she set the plate down, the cat sniffed at it, then began to eat delicately, like he’d been raised in a palace, not scavenging behind diners or back alleys.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” Rio said, crossing her arms and watching him. “You’re a fancy bastard.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He flicked his tail once in response.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She let out a breath and leaned back against the counter, still watching him. There was something uncanny about him. Not just his arrival, but how he’d matched exactly the image she’d drawn that morning, right down to the little silver-tipped hairs around his ears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, this is weird,” she whispered. “This whole town is weird.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The cat finished eating and sauntered into the living room like he owned the place, curling up on a blanket like he’d been waiting for her to get his room ready.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She followed him, brows drawn together, arms crossed. “You need a name,” she said slowly. “Unless you already have one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He cracked one eye open, his pupils narrowing into slits.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, the name on the tip of her tongue before she even realized she was thinking it. “Salem.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His ears perked. He sat up, tail curling around his feet. And then—</span>
<em>
<span>then</span>
</em>
<span>—he looked right at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She blinked. “No way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He meowed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at him. “You like that name?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A louder meow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, Salem it is,” she said, uneasily amused. “But we’re still going to a vet. Just in case you’re not secretly a demon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He yawned, long and slow, as if insulted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio threw on a coat, scooped him into an old laundry basket lined with a blanket, and grabbed her keys. “You picked the weirdest girl in town to haunt, you know that?” she muttered, and Salem blinked up at her with what she swore looked like agreement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The ride into town was mostly silent, the soft whir of the car tires the only sound. Salem was curled in the passenger seat now, having insisted on climbing out of the basket halfway through the drive. He watched the road like he was navigating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, but just so we’re clear,” Rio muttered, “I’m still in charge.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Salem flicked his tail.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The vet’s office sat in a cozy corner of Thistle Grove’s main strip, wrapped in creeping ivy and painted a calming moss green. The sign above read: “Dr. Jennifer Kale, DVM – Thistle Grove Animal Clinic” in sleek gold lettering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, the waiting room smelled like cedarwood and something minty. Rio barely had time to sit down with Salem in her lap before the door to the back opened and a tall woman stepped out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was striking—tall and commanding, with warm brown skin, a shaved head that caught the light, and eyes sharp enough to catch a lie mid-air. Her white coat was spotless, and her smile was kind but steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio Vidal?” she asked, already clocking the cat in her arms. “I’m Dr. Kale. Come on back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The exam room was cozy, full of soft lighting and soft-spoken energy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s gorgeous,” Dr. Kale said, stroking Salem’s head with practiced fingers. “Little underweight. No collar, no chip. But otherwise? Very healthy. Did he find you or…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He found me,” Rio said. “Walked right into my house this morning like he’d been planning it all along.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Kale chuckled. “Cats don’t choose lightly. If he walked in, he’s already decided you’re his.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave Salem a sidelong glance. “That’s what I’m afraid of.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Kale smiled as she entered notes into a tablet. “Some animals… have a way of knowing where they’re needed. He doesn’t seem like your average stray.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>No kidding, Rio thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once Salem was cleared and she paid the bill, Rio asked, “Do you know a place in town where I can grab pet supplies?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Familiar Spirits,” Dr. Kale said. “Corner of Maple and Ash. Ask for Maeve. She’ll hook you up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Familiar Spirits was exactly what Rio should’ve expected from a shop in a place like Thistle Grove. Half pet store, half occult emporium. The shelves were stacked with everything from organic kibble to tarot card chew toys and hand-carved pet beds shaped like crescent moons.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Salem trotted beside her on a leash, which he somehow tolerated. She was scanning a wall of plush mice when she heard a familiar voice from the next aisle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, Scratchy, we are not getting the parsley hay. You never finish it, and it makes your breath smell like compost.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio peeked around the corner—and there she was. Agatha Harkness in a long charcoal coat, hair twisted back into a loose knot, holding a small basket of rabbit supplies and arguing quietly with a velvet-lined carrier perched in her cart. Inside it sat the fluffiest white rabbit Rio had ever seen, with what looked like an honest-to-god attitude problem.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up, mid-eye-roll, and froze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “Hey.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brows rose, but she recovered quickly, smoothing her expression into something halfway amused. “Well, if it isn’t the new cat lady of Thistle Grove.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held up a bag of salmon treats. “Guilty. You know, it’s only been a few hours and I already feel like he owns my house.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes slid down to Salem, who—naturally—had wrapped his leash around Rio’s ankles like he was casting a trap spell. “He looks like the type.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed softly, adjusting the leash. “You here for your—what did you call him? Scratchy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rabbit, as if on cue, gave a loud thump from his carrier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. “The demon himself. He’s my companion-slash-overlord. We have an arrangement.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes crinkled. “That’s… shockingly relatable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, they just stood there, two grown women surrounded by squeaky toys and pet crystals, their animals clearly running the show.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, a smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. “You know, I don’t usually run into people here. Most locals get their supplies from the feed store in the next town over. This place is a little… odd.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked around at the moonstone pet collars and the herbal remedy shelf. “Odd seems par for the course these days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a beat. Then Agatha stepped closer, her voice a bit softer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You settling in okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “Yeah. I mean… as much as anyone can in a house with creaky floorboards and a cat that may or may not be a figment of my imagination.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze flicked to Salem again, and something thoughtful passed over her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” she said lightly, “if he is imaginary, he’s got excellent taste in canned food.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, warm and easy. “Thanks. I think.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached for a bag of alfalfa hay, but her voice stayed casual. “Maybe we’ll bump into each other again soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, then smiled. “I’d like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she turned to check out, she couldn’t help but glance over her shoulder one more time. Agatha was still watching her, just briefly, before turning her attention back to her rabbit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Salem? He was purring. Again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re trouble,” Rio whispered to him, but she was smiling as she said it.</span>

<span>The chime above the pet store door had barely stopped ringing when she finally moved again, placing the last of Mr. Scratchy’s items on the counter without comment. Her smile toward Maeve was thin, automatic. She paid, scooped up her bunny’s carrier, and headed out into the chilled afternoon air, her boots striking sharply against the pavement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once in her car, she buckled Mr. Scratchy in with practiced ease, then sat in the driver’s seat for a moment, staring at her hands on the wheel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A figment of her imagination. She must have dreamt about him,” she muttered, shaking her head. “Of course she did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The cat wasn’t just a stray. Salem—</span>
<em>
<span>gods, even the name</span>
</em>
<span>—was a familiar. And not the kind that wandered into just anyone’s life. Familiars chose witches, and they only did so when the bond was ready. When the power was ready.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio Vidal, like it or not, had been chosen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slammed the car door harder than necessary and stalked up the winding path to Wanda’s house, her boots crunching over the gravel like thunder in the quiet dusk. The storm from the night before had passed, but something inside her hadn’t settled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mr. Scratchy, perfectly content in his carrier, gave a disapproving thump of a hind leg as she placed him down on Wanda’s kitchen floor. Agatha barely spared him a glance before unbuttoning her coat with stiff fingers and letting it fall over a chair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was already waiting for her—of course she was. Leaning against the kitchen counter, sipping from a chipped mug with a faint smirk tugging at her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look like someone who just saw a ghost,” she said lazily, setting the mug down with a soft clink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed the room in three quick strides. “She has a familiar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s eyes sparked, and she didn’t even try to hide the satisfaction blooming on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was </span>
<em>
<span>fast</span>
</em>
<span>,” she murmured, more to herself than Agatha. Then, louder: “And what kind of familiar are we talking? Crow? Fox? Something dramatic?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Cat,” Agatha bit out. “Gray. Green eyes. Looked like it had been through hell, but it marched into her cottage like it belonged there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda smiled into her tea. “Because it does belong there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Don’t start.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not starting. I’m continuing,” Wanda said sweetly. “Because I’ve been saying for a while now that she’s waking up. And you—” she pointed a finger at Agatha like a wand— “have been pretending it’s all coincidence.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She still doesn’t know anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She has a familiar, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t reply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda set her mug down. “Do you remember how long it took Scratchy to come to you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s throat tightened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mr. Scratchy, now out of his carrier and lounging beneath the kitchen table, let out a soft grunt, as if remembering too. He had come to her when Nicky died—when her magic had been threatening to consume her entirely. She hadn’t known how badly she needed him until he showed up and refused to leave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s untrained,” Agatha said finally. “She doesn’t know what’s happening to her. Doesn’t even know what a Thread is. And now she’s bonded with a familiar. Her powers might be stronger than we can even imagine at this rate. And she has no idea.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then maybe it’s time you told her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s not ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda raised a brow. “Or you’re not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glared, but it lacked heat. The truth was too close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s tone softened slightly, though the smug undercurrent still lingered. “You know what it means, don’t you? For a familiar to appear like that. It’s not random. It’s not an accident. It means the land recognized her. The magic did. And it offered her something sacred in return. It means she’s ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned toward the window. Outside, the trees stood dark and still, the clouds slowly parting to let pale light spill through. “She doesn’t even want to be here. She’s just trying to grieve and make sense of her life again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Which is exactly when magic finds us,” Wanda said. “When we’re cracked open. When something inside us is ready, even if we’re not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shut her eyes. “She’s not safe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda tilted her head. “No. Not if we leave her like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence lingered between them, thick as fog. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha folded her arms tightly across her chest. “I don’t want her dragged into this. Into us. Into what this whole Threads bullshit expects.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda crossed the space and touched her arm gently. “You think she hasn’t already been dragged in? The moment the cottage called her back. The moment her fingers made flowers bloom. The moment that cat crossed her threshold. She’s not standing on the edge anymore, Agatha. She’s already in it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, quiet. “I’ve already lost too much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s eyes softened. “And maybe she’s not here to take anything else. Maybe she’s here to give something back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But in her chest, that old ache stirred again—tangled with a new pull she didn’t want to name. Not yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not when everything was changing again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bar was warm in that hazy, familiar way—dim lighting, a soft buzz of conversation, the smell of old wood and whiskey. She sat in her usual corner booth, fingers curled around a half-empty glass of Laphroaig, letting the smoke bite down her throat just enough to keep her grounded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t sure what she’d come here for. Answers didn’t live in bars. But the truth was, she didn’t want to go home. She didn’t want to sit in silence and think about the cat. The familiar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or Rio, for that matter.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Gods.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had barely made peace with the idea that the woman was one of the Threads—and now a familiar had shown up? That only happened when magic had rooted itself deep, anchored itself in someone’s soul.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio hadn’t even flinched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No panic. No questions. Just picked the damn thing up and bought it toys.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took another drink, slow, thoughtful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t told Wanda everything. Not really. She hadn’t said that when she and Rio touched—first by the lake, then again on the way into the cottage—it felt like something woke up. Like a piece of her she’d buried years ago cracked open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was the part she didn’t know how to explain. Or maybe didn’t want to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door opened behind her. A gust of cold slipped in with the sound of boots on wood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t have to look. She felt her before she saw her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio Vidal. Wearing a black leather skirt, a deep green sweater and a black coat over it, which made her look unfairly gorgeous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She scanned the room, dark eyes skipping across the tables—until they found her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Rio smiled. Just a little. Not smug, not flirty, not trying. Just… warm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed her sigh and looked back down at her glass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A moment later, Rio appeared beside the booth. “Funny running into you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t look up. “It’s the only bar in town.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not true. There’s the distillery outside of Thistle Creek. Technically counts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a sidelong glance. “That’s forty-five minutes away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, curls still wild from the wind. “Maybe I was in the mood for local.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t ask to sit, just slid into the booth across from her like she belonged there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And maybe she did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried not to stare. “Rough day?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Long one,” Rio said. “But good. Productive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That word made Agatha look up. “You’re drawing again?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, clearly surprised. “You remembered that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached into her coat and pulled out a folded-up paper bag. “Made some poor financial decisions at the pet store.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “Salem.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio laughed. “He’s already acting like he pays rent. But he let me sleep for eight hours straight last night, so honestly, I might buy him a whole condo.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brows lifted. “You’re taking this… surprisingly well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What, the cat? I mean, I didn’t expect him, but…” She shrugged. “Some things just fit, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sipped her drink to avoid saying something foolish. Like: That’s not just a cat. Or: You’re more than you think.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or: I have no idea how to protect you from what’s coming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she said, “You named him Salem.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah. Classic, right? He just looked like a Salem.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly. “It suits him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back, looking at her curiously. “Why are you here, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean…” She waved a hand between them. “You and me. Bar. Friday night. We’re turning this into a habit. I figured you’d be home with your rabbit and a bottle of something better than this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked despite herself. “Mr. Scratchy does prefer quiet nights.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So why aren’t you there?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her glass for a long moment. “Maybe I needed noise. Or… company.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or both?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha met her gaze. “Maybe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat in that quiet space for a while—warm and electric and impossible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio eventually finished her ginger beer and pushed the empty glass aside. “Well, for what it’s worth, I’m glad I ran into you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to keep her voice level. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled. “You have a calming presence.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed a laugh. “No one’s ever said that to me before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then they haven’t seen you like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something twisted in her chest. Something dangerous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence stretched between them—comfortable, but laced with something neither of them had quite named yet. Agatha found herself studying the slope of Rio’s jaw, the curl of her dark hair damp at the ends from the walk over, the faint smudge of graphite still on her fingertips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s real. That’s what Agatha kept thinking. Real and stubborn and grounding in a way she hadn’t realized she needed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could stop herself, she heard her own voice say, “You want something better than bar whiskey?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up, brows lifting. “That sounds dangerously like an offer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. “It’s not dangerous. Just… better scotch. Warmer chairs. Less sticky tables.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned forward, eyes dancing. “And Mr. Scratchy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s judgmental, but he keeps to himself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio considered for a beat, then nodded. “Sure. Let’s go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They walked back through the quiet streets of Thistle Grove, wind whistling faintly through bare trees. The last of the leaves clung to branches in deep gold and rusted red, but winter was making its presence known. A sharp chill had settled into the bones of the town.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s house wasn’t far—an old two-story just past the apothecary, tucked into the end of a cul-de-sac. It was quiet, the porch light a soft glow in the dark. Rio looked around, taking in the creeping ivy on the front and the worn but well-kept stone steps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Didn’t picture you as a ‘homey’ type,” Rio said as they walked up to the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not,” Agatha replied, unlocking it. “But I like my space. And no one bothers me out here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pushed the door open, letting Rio step inside first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was warm, cozy even. Not in a traditional way—there were strange herbs hanging by the window, stacks of books along every surface, and a fireplace that crackled with an actual flame—but there was something lived-in about it. Safe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned in a slow circle. “Wow. It’s like… a storybook witch’s house, but cooler.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Is that a compliment?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Absolutely.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled and moved to the kitchen. “Sit down. I’ll grab the good stuff.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She poured two fingers of Macallan into heavy glasses and came back to find Rio crouching by a bookshelf, flipping through an old volume of poetry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>They’d been sitting together for over an hour now, low in their chairs by the fire, the glasses of scotch sitting nearly empty between them on the side table. Outside, the wind had picked up, tapping against the windows like impatient fingers. Inside, though, it was warm. Quiet. A kind of easy that Agatha wasn’t used to feeling—especially not around someone who made her pulse do what Rio Vidal did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned forward to set her glass down, brushing her fingers against the rim. “That’s really good,” she murmured, smiling. “You have taste, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. “Of course I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched Rio move, graceful without trying to be, every shift of her body so natural it made Agatha’s mouth go a little dry. Rio pushed her chair back without thinking, the movement a little too sharp. Her hip clipped the edge of the narrow table between her and Agatha, and with a clatter, the glass tumbler toppled over. It hit the hardwood floor and shattered into jagged shards that skittered outward like tiny knives.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, I’m so sorry!” Rio said quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barely had time to process the sharp clatter of the tumbler hitting the floor before Rio was already moving — too fast, too thoughtless — dropping to her knees among the scattered shards of glass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No—” Agatha started, but the word snagged uselessly in her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She saw it happen as if time slowed — the wicked point of a shard waiting, the way Rio’s knee would land. And worse — she felt it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A pulse of magic tore through her without warning, snapping tight behind her eyes. In a flash, she saw the outcome: the glass driving deep, blood pouring fast, infection setting in, tendons torn — pain that would not stop unless someone intervened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart lurched into her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The glass punched through her pantyhose with a sickening crunch. Rio gasped, half-falling as her leg gave out under her. Blood was already blooming, fast and dark, against the sheer fabric.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved on instinct, every nerve lit up with urgency. She caught Rio under the arms, dragging her up and away from the broken glass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hold still,” she ordered, her voice tight with a fear she couldn’t afford to show.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sagged against her, breath hissing through her teeth. Agatha pressed her hand over the torn fabric, feeling the blood, the damage — and she knew, with grim certainty, what had to happen next.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was no time to hesitate. No time to lie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can fix it,” she said quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a look—half skeptical, half confused. “Do you… have a first aid kit or something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let her fingers hover just above the gash. The magic thrummed under her skin, eager and warm and terrifying in how instinctive it felt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her, dazed and hurting, the confusion in her eyes cutting deeper than any wound.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t hesitate. She couldn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pressed her palm carefully over the torn fabric, over the slick, bleeding wound. The moment her skin touched Rio’s, her magic leapt to meet her — not wild, not unruly, but steady and sure, like it had been waiting for this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft golden light unfurled from her hand, spilling through her fingers and sinking into Rio’s skin. The glow warmed the space between them, delicate and bright, as if the magic itself knew to be gentle with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Under her touch, the bleeding slowed. Torn flesh knit itself together with quiet, aching precision. The magic hummed low in her bones, wrapping around Rio like a promise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the worst of it had passed, Agatha pulled her hand away, her fingers shaking just a little. The blood was already drying. The wound was nothing but a faint, angry mark — nothing that would scar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was staring at her, wide-eyed, the fading golden light reflected in her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard. For once, she didn’t have the strength — or the will — to lie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her. “That’s… what did you just—?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t pull back right away. Her hand lingered, brushing lightly against Rio’s calf, grounding them both.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I healed you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “Yeah, no shit. </span>
<em>
<span>How</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finally looked up at her, eyes shadowed and serious. “Because I couldn’t not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood slowly, brushing glass off her palms, but her gaze never left Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened her mouth to say something—maybe a joke, maybe a challenge—but stopped when she saw the look in Agatha’s eyes. The depth of it. The fear. The honesty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I saw what would happen if I didn’t act right then,” Agatha went on, her voice steadier now, but still soft. She touched the spot on Rio’s leg again. “I saw too much blood. Panic. You falling. I just… I couldn’t let it happen. Not to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room went still. The fire crackled behind them. Rain tapped gently against the windows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a long moment, neither of them said anything. Agatha’s hand finally slipped away from Rio’s skin, but the space she left behind still hummed with something Rio didn’t have words for. Not yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a shaky breath and stood, pacing the length of the living room for a moment. Then she stopped and leaned back slightly against the back of the couch, blinking at Agatha like she was trying to make out a shape in the fog.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You saw what would happen?” she echoed, incredulously. “Like—what, in your head? Some kind of psychic flash? Is that a thing now too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t smile. She just nodded once, slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, but there was no humor in it—just disbelief, nerves crackling like static. “Jesus. Okay. So you can heal people, you can see the future, and you’re—what, casually psychic with a side of storm-summoning?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a look—dry, steady. “I didn’t summon any storms.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s the part you’re taking issue with?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m serious.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So am I!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air between them buzzed with tension, almost electric. Rio’s eyes were wide, still a little wild, like she wasn’t sure whether to bolt out the door or sit down and ask a thousand more questions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha softened just a little. “I know this is a lot. But I didn’t do it to scare you. I didn’t want to do anything. I just… reacted. It was instinct.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her, and then glanced down at her leg—smooth, clean skin where a deep cut should have been. She looked back up. “That wasn’t instinct, Agatha. That was—impossible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A beat. Agatha tilted her head. “You live in a haunted cottage, saw flowers bloom around us, dreamed about a cat that now lives with you, and you think this is where it gets impossible?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened her mouth, closed it again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, you’re just like me. A witch,” Agatha continued, her voice soft.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A different kind of silence fell. This one was heavy, contemplative. Something had shifted—between them, around them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio, despite everything, didn’t run.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moved toward the chair she’d been sitting in before, like her legs weren’t quite steady underneath her. She pulled out a chair and sat down heavily, her eyes still darting to her leg like it might suddenly decide to start bleeding again. It hadn’t. The skin there was clean, smooth. Whole.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stayed near the counter, giving her space. Her fingers brushed against the rim of her tumbler, but she didn’t lift it. Her eyes stayed on Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know it’s a lot,” she said quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted softly, though there wasn’t much humor in it. “</span>
<em>
<span>You think</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth quirked into the ghost of a smile. “I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A long beat passed between them. The only sound was the clock on the wall ticking softly behind them and the quiet wind beyond the windows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ran a hand over her face. “So… okay. Let’s just say I’m… not completely ruling it out. Hypothetically. You’re saying I’m a witch. But I’ve never done anything… witchy. I don’t have any spells. I don’t even own sage.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t laugh, but her eyes warmed. “It’s not about spells. Not really. Not at first.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then what is it about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a moment, choosing her words carefully. “It’s about connection. To the land. To instinct. To power that isn’t always visible, but always present. It starts small—gut feelings that turn out to be right. Dreams that linger too long. The way you dreamed about Salem before he showed up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stiffened. “Wait. How do you know about that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “You told me. At the pet store. You said that you didn’t know if he’d come from your imagination or something like that. Remember?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh. Right.” She shook her head. “Jesus.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped a little closer, cautious. “You don’t have to believe me all at once. I know it’s a hard pill to swallow. But something in you already does, or you wouldn’t be asking questions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t answer right away. Her eyes were on her hands, which were folded on her lap now. The fingertips of one tapped lightly against the other, as though keeping time with a rhythm she didn’t quite understand yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, finally: “And this thing with you… and me… when we touch. The flowers. That’s part of it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” she said, quietly. “Kind of. Though that’s… more complicated.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course it is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t mean for any of this to happen,” Agatha added. “I wasn’t trying to drag you into something you weren’t ready for.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then why did you heal me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her. Really looked. And for a moment, something unguarded flickered in her expression. Something real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because I couldn’t not do it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes narrowed slightly. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A breath. A heartbeat. And then: “Because I saw what would happen if I didn’t. And I couldn’t let that happen to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her. She didn’t speak. Not for a while.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha let the silence hang, let Rio sit with the impossible truth of what she’d seen, what she’d done.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Rio leaned back in her chair and exhaled like she was emptying a whole drawer of thoughts at once. “Okay. Alright. I need… I don’t know. More scotch. A nap. A full psychiatric evaluation. Possibly all three.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. “I can do scotch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Figures.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t say no when Agatha poured them both another glass, the amber liquid catching the light in the room as it slid into the crystal tumblers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does it always feel like… this?” Rio asked, after a long, contemplative sip. “Like, I’m just… thrown into this whole new world where magic is real and I’m supposed to… do something with it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back against the counter, watching her with an unreadable expression. “I’m not going to say it’s easy. It might not feel natural at first. But eventually, it’s just part of who you are. Like breathing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And Salem. That damn cat–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s your familiar. The fact that he’s already found you means that your power is definitely active and ingrained in who you are.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is messed up,” Rio muttered, taking another drink. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not really,” Agatha said. Her voice softened slightly. “The hardest part is understanding that you’re not alone. You’re connected to something bigger, even when it doesn’t feel that way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced at her through lowered lashes. “This is what you were talking about, right? Connection. The land. The power.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blew out a breath, looking at her glass before meeting Agatha’s gaze again. “So what now? Do you… teach me to be a witch? Do I need to go to magic school or Hogwarts or whatever? Or is that just not how it works?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s expression was unreadable for a long moment before she chuckled. “Calm down, Potter, you’re not getting a wand just yet,” she offered a playful grin and Rio let out an incredulous laugh. “I can teach you the basics, but I suppose that depends on whether or not you want to learn. This isn’t something that can be forced.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her. “And you think I want to?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a half-shrug, her gaze steady. “I think you already do. Whether you’re ready to admit it or not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t sure what to make of that, so she took another sip of her scotch and didn’t say anything. The silence between them stretched a little longer, but this time, it didn’t feel quite so heavy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swirled the amber liquid in her glass, the ice long since melted. “So what exactly can you do? You know, besides magically healing gaping wounds and brooding dramatically in corners.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “You’ve barely scratched the surface of my dramatic repertoire.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted softly, then sobered. “Seriously, though. Is this your whole life? Potions, spells, secret familiars?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned against the kitchen counter, crossing her arms. “I’ve kept my power pretty quiet for a long time now. I only started using it again… recently.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why’d you stop?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked away, her jaw tightening slightly. “That’s a longer story. One I’m not sure I’m ready to share just yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a look, half amusement, half challenge. “You do realize I just watched you stitch my skin together with glowing light, right? I think I can handle a story.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips parted like she might say something, but she hesitated. Instead, she let out a soft breath and tilted her head. “Let’s just say… magic comes with a price. And sometimes it fails you. So I was angry and I decided to leave it all behind me. After what happened with my mother… And—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze softened. “She was a witch, too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “She disappeared over twenty years ago. No note. No explanation. One day she was just… gone. People say she got lost in her magic. That it consumed her. I didn’t want that to happen to me—or to Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was silence for a moment, heavier now but not uncomfortable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her scotch, then murmured, “Is that what you think will happen to me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her then, really looked. Her voice was low but firm. “No. I think you’re different. You’re grounded, even if you don’t realize it yet. And you have something my mother never had.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow. “And what’s that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Someone watching out for you,” Agatha said, then took a slow sip of her drink. “Even if you don’t want me to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That took the air out of Rio for a second. Her breath caught, almost imperceptibly, but it was there. She didn’t speak right away, just stared down at her glass like it held answers she couldn’t find anywhere else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, she asked, softer now, “So how do I even begin with this? I mean, is there a rulebook? A tutorial? A ‘Witchcraft for Dummies’ guide I can borrow?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled under her breath. “Not unless Wanda’s finally written one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “Wanda?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My best friend. Red hair. Sharp tongue. Absolutely terrifying. You guys met the other day at the shop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled faintly. “Sounds like someone I’d get along with.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head. “You just might.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another quiet moment stretched out between them, the kind that didn’t need to be filled. The scotch, the flickering candlelight from the kitchen, the distant rumble of the storm outside—everything felt muted, suspended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced at the clock. “It’s late.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Agatha said softly, but didn’t move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood, glass in hand, and leaned back against the table. “So, you’re saying I’m a witch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I’ve got a familiar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Definitely.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And possibly very dangerous powers I don’t know how to use.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a dry smile. “Welcome to Thistle Grove.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head slowly, then drained the rest of her scotch. “This is officially the weirdest week of my life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled. “It only gets weirder from here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was afraid you’d say that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ran a hand through her curls and set the empty glass down with a little clink. Her eyes swept the living room, then landed on the front door. “I should probably head back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, who’d just stood to grab them more water, shot her a look over her shoulder. “You’re kidding. It’s raining like crazy out there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve driven in worse,” Rio offered, though even she didn’t sound convinced.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve also been drinking. I’m not healing you again because you decided to be stubborn.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “You say that like it’s a real possibility.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed her arms. “You think I’m exaggerating?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“…No,” Rio muttered, glancing back at her leg. “Fine. I’ll crash on your couch or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Guest room,” Agatha said, already turning to grab some water glasses. “I’m not a total monster, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she passed one to Rio, their fingers brushed—just a brief, incidental graze, but the kitchen light flickered overhead. Rio’s head jerked up, eyes wide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was that—?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Probably,” Agatha said calmly, though her fingers lingered a second too long on the glass before she stepped back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed and rubbed her palm. “That… doesn’t happen with anyone else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should hope not,” Agatha said with a ghost of a smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The mood wasn’t heavy now, not exactly, but there was a hush to it—an awareness. Like the air was thick with something unsaid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved to sit at the edge of the low windowsill, watching the rain trickle down the glass. “When two witches’ magic aligns, it can do strange things,” she said quietly. “Especially when they’re… connected.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned against the counter, her brow furrowed. “Connected how?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged one shoulder, fingers absently trailing the wooden sill. “Sometimes magic just recognizes something before we do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her hand, remembering the golden light that had spilled from Agatha’s palm and stitched her skin whole. She stepped closer, setting her glass beside the sink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I try something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, intrigued. “Try what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held out her hand. “Touch. On purpose this time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at it for a beat. Then, with deliberate slowness, she lifted her own and pressed it to Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The effect was instant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A low hum passed between their palms, like a current of warmth. Gold light shimmered at the center of their contact point, spiraling outward in thin, glowing tendrils. A nearby candle flared brighter. From a nearby potted plant, a single flower bloomed, soft and violet, trembling like it had just breathed for the first time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth parted slightly. “Holy—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice was low. “Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The light faded slowly, leaving only the heat of their skin. But Rio didn’t pull away. Her gaze drifted to Agatha’s face, searching.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does this happen with other witches?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Some,” Agatha admitted. “But not like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced at the flower, then their hands. “This is insane.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s magic,” Agatha murmured. “It’s rarely sane.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stayed like that for a moment longer—hands joined, pulses steady but elevated. Then Rio gently withdrew, fingertips brushing along Agatha’s as she did. Lights above them dimmed, like the house was reluctantly letting them go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio licked her lips. “So… guest room, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, then smirked. “Unless you’re brave enough to try sleeping in the kitchen with Mr. Scratchy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I’ll take my chances in the guest room, then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha led her down the hall, their shoulders brushed in the narrow corridor—and a soft flicker of light rippled down the walls, chasing them like fireflies.</span>
</p><p> </p>

<p>
<span>The guest room was cozy and a little mismatched, like the rest of Agatha’s house—warm-toned quilts, old wood furniture with ornate carvings, and soft lamplight that pooled golden over everything. It smelled faintly like lavender and something else—moss and rosemary, maybe. Something wild.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood awkwardly by the bed, arms loosely folded across her chest as Agatha flitted around her, smoothing the blanket, lighting another small candle on the bedside table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You really don’t have to fuss,” Rio said, a little overwhelmed by the domesticity of it all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha only arched an eyebrow. “It’s basic hospitality,” she replied, leaving a pair of flannel pajama pants and a shirt on top of the blanket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t know you did hospitality.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m full of surprises.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched her in the soft light, the way her hands moved with quiet efficiency. There was something careful in it, like she didn’t want Rio to feel like a burden. It worked. It made something sharp in her chest soften.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to her, brushing her hands together. “There are fresh towels in the bathroom if you want a shower, and I put a glass of water on the nightstand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded with a small smile. “Thanks. For all of this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged, but there was warmth in her eyes. “You’re welcome.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their gazes held a second longer than necessary. Not quite a charged moment—but close. Familiar. Magnetic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Agatha stepped back toward the doorway. “Get some rest, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, watching her go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But just before Agatha could fully disappear down the hallway, Rio called softly, “Hey.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused and looked back, a flicker of something unreadable in her expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gestured to the space around her. “All of this… it’s nice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A ghost of a smile curved Agatha’s lips. “Don’t get used to it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with that, she vanished into the hall, the door clicking shut behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood in place for a moment, listening to the sound of her own breath, to the rain falling softly outside. Then she sat down on the edge of the bed and toed off her boots, running a hand through her curls as she looked around the room once more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The flower Agatha had placed in a little glass dish on the windowsill—pale and violet, the one that bloomed when they touched—was still there, alive and open, its petals stretching toward the dark.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at it, heart beating a little too fast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she whispered to the quiet. “This is happening.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>After changing into the clothes Agatha had left for her, she lay back on the bed, eyes wide in the dark, and let that truth settle into her bones.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>She lay there for a while, staring up at the ceiling, but rest didn’t come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The more she thought about it, the more it felt like her thoughts were starting to spin out of control, cycling through the same questions she didn’t have answers to.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You’re a witch, Rio.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hadn’t said the words exactly like that. Not directly. But she might as well have.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then there was the glass. The magic. The healing. The flower. The way her body had pulsed like something inside her had been awakened. And the cat. Salem.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>God—the cat.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She sat up sharply, heart pounding. She hadn’t told Agatha about drawing him. Or dreaming about him. Or how he looked at her like he knew her the moment she said his name. None of this made sense. None of it could be real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Could it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>As her breathing quickened, the storm outside began to rise. Wind slammed against the windows. Rain battered the roof in heavy, unrelenting waves. The trees beyond the glass groaned under the weight of the wind. A sharp crack of thunder split the sky, and the lights flickered—just once—but it was enough to make Rio jump.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she whispered, standing up. Her voice shook. “Okay, just breathe. You’re not losing it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She paced the room in slow circles, rubbing her arms. Her skin felt like it didn’t belong to her. Her fingertips tingled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lightning struck again—closer this time, illuminating the room in a brilliant, white-hot flash that made the flower on the windowsill almost glow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned toward it. The petals shimmered faintly. Undeniably alive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her chest tightened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stumbled toward the window, trying to steady her breathing, but the storm outside was matching her panic beat for beat, like it was wired to her heartbeat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Was it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another rumble of thunder vibrated through the glass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She grabbed the edges of the windowsill and bowed her head. Her curls fell forward, damp with sweat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is happening to me?” she whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No one answered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But deep down, something inside her stirred.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not in fear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In recognition.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The storm crashed again, louder this time, shaking the walls like some great beast had slammed against the house. Thunder boomed so close, so sharp, Rio swore she felt it in her bones. Rain hammered the windows like fists, and the wind howled, tearing through the trees outside with a ferocity that made her stomach twist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pressed her palm against the cold glass of the window, heart hammering in her chest. Her breaths came too fast, too shallow, and she couldn’t stop the spinning thoughts: What is happening to me? What am I becoming?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The lights flickered again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hands trembled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t know whether she wanted to scream or cry or run, but her body had gone cold with panic. Magic? That word still felt too big for her. Too far-fetched. She was just a girl who liked to draw, who’d been cheated on, who’d inherited a crumbling cottage and a storm she couldn’t control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then—soft footsteps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A gentle knock at the door, followed by a low voice that reached her like an anchor in a hurricane.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” Agatha’s voice. Steady. Warm. Grounding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned sharply, breath catching, eyes wide like a deer caught in headlights.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door creaked open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped inside, wrapped in a deep burgundy robe, her long dark hair loose and slightly tousled from sleep. She took in the scene without speaking: Rio standing pale and shaken by the window, the way her shoulders rose and fell with ragged breaths, the panic in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s expression softened instantly, her voice dropping to something that felt like a balm. “You’re causing the storm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, her mouth opening but no sound coming out at first. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The wind, the thunder, the lightning—it’s you,” Agatha said gently. “Your panic. Your fear. It’s bleeding into the world.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s… that’s not possible.” Rio shook her head, voice hoarse. “How could I possibly be doing that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved a little closer, slow and deliberate, like she might scare her off otherwise. “Magic doesn’t always ask your permission. Especially not when it’s this new. Especially not when you don’t know how to control it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio backed away a step, bumping into the small side table near the bed. Her hands gripped the edge of it. “I…I didn’t mean to do anything. I didn’t try—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha said, voice low and kind. “But you don’t have to try. That’s why I didn’t want you going through this alone. Just breathe with me for a moment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thunder rolled again—but this time, quieter. Less violent. As if the storm itself were listening now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at Agatha, breathing hard, heart still racing. “This is crazy,” she said. “I’m not—I’m not like you. I’m just… me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s expression didn’t change. She simply lifted her hand, palm open, not forcing anything. Just offering. “You’re you. And that is enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes flicked to her hand. Hesitation warred with need inside her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m scared,” she whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know.” Agatha’s voice was velvet over stone—gentle but unwavering. “But you don’t have to be alone in it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared a moment longer. Then—fingers trembling—she reached for Agatha’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment their skin met, something shifted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft pulse of golden light bloomed from the point of contact, not blinding or loud, but warm. Safe. The light spiraled between their fingers like threads being woven. Rio sucked in a sharp breath, but this time it wasn’t from fear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was wonder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Outside, the wind softened. The rain tapered. The angry rattle of thunder faded into distant, harmless rumbling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The house stilled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped in closer, hand still holding Rio’s, the other reaching to gently brush a strand of hair from her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re okay,” she murmured. “Just breathe. That’s all you need to do right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly. One breath. Then another. She didn’t even realize she was crying until Agatha reached up to wipe away the tear that slipped down her cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t understand any of this,” Rio whispered. “It doesn’t make sense.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It doesn’t have to. Not yet,” Agatha said. “It's okay. You’re not alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked at her, eyes wide, the storm finally ebbing inside her chest. “How do you do that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head. “Do what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Make everything stop feeling so impossible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a soft, tired smile. “Magic, maybe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed weakly, barely a breath. Then she squeezed Agatha’s hand, just a little, just enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And somewhere in the corner of the room, a tiny wildflower bloomed right through the cracks of the old wooden floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at the wildflower breaking through the floorboards—small, delicate, pale blue with petals like watercolor strokes. It shouldn’t have been there. Not in this room, not this time of year, not after a storm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked back at Agatha, voice barely above a whisper. “Did I do that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha followed her gaze, and her expression shifted into something reverent. Not surprise, not fear—but awe. She gave a single nod. “Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swayed slightly where she stood, and Agatha tightened her grip on her hand, steadying her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t mean to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t need to,” Agatha said softly. “Magic responds to emotion. To connection. You’re just… beginning to see what you’ve always carried.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a shaky breath and dropped her gaze, as if embarrassed. “What if I don’t want it? Any of this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t let go. “That’s your choice. But it’s still part of you. Denying it won’t erase it. It’ll only make it harder to control.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A pause lingered between them. The room had gone quiet now, the storm reduced to a soft patter of rain on the roof, like the sky had finally taken a breath too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked down at their still-joined hands, then finally pulled hers back—not sharply, but gently, as if she were afraid she’d burn from too much contact. “You said I wasn’t alone,” she said, still not looking up. “Does that mean you’ll help me? Even if I’m bad at this? Even if I never get the hang of it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes searched her face for a long beat. Then, quiet but sure: “Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “Even if I don’t want to be part of whatever magical society or weird sacred order you belong to?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, a hint of that usual fire back in her eyes. “Especially then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That earned a soft laugh from Rio—short, surprised. “You really think this is funny?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha said, but her voice was warm. “I think it’s beautiful. And terrifying. But you’re still standing. That counts for something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked away, toward the little bloom still growing between the floorboards. “I feel like I should be more freaked out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You were. About five minutes ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned back to her, lips quirking. “Right. I forgot—you’re keeping score.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m very good at scorekeeping.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was something in her tone that made Rio look a little longer than she meant to. Something fond and unexpected blooming just behind the sarcasm. She folded her arms, suddenly aware of how close they were standing, how quiet the house had gotten.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should probably… go back to bed,” she said, almost reluctantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, just once, and gestured toward the bed. “Okay. I'm right next door if you need anything. Try not to make any more flowers bloom in the hallway,” Agatha grinned, winking at her teasingly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No promises,” Rio grinned weakly, following her to the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled under her breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Yes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks. For stopping the storm. And for… not running away screaming.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her for a long, unreadable moment. “I didn’t stop the storm. You did.” Then she added softly, “I’d never run from you, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That left Rio standing stunned for a second too long, heart pounding in a whole new rhythm now. She nodded mutely, slipping into the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t say anything else—just reached out, gently touched the frame of the door, and the lights dimmed as if cued by her presence alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she was gone, leaving Rio with her thoughts, her barely-stitched-together sense of reality, and a storm that had finally gone still inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The scent of coffee hit Rio before she opened her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not the harsh, burnt kind from the ancient machine she’d salvaged for her own kitchen. This was smoother, richer—something that made her think of dark beans freshly ground, of hands that knew how to coax the best out of everything they touched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She blinked awake slowly, the light already spilling through the window in thin golden lines across the guest room. Everything was warm. Soft. Safe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she remembered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The storm. The panic. The flower. Magic.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat up abruptly, the throw blanket sliding off her shoulders. The memory of Agatha’s hands on hers, of the way her voice had cut through the chaos like a lighthouse beam, returned like a wave—followed by the one that mattered most:</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I’d never run from you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus,” she muttered under her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swung her legs off the side of the bed, and made her way toward the bathroom. After splashing her face with cold water and stealing one of the soft towels hanging by the sink, she took a breath and looked at herself in the mirror.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hair a mess. Eyes a little wide. But she didn’t look broken. Just… different.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Awake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The scent of coffee hadn’t faded. So she followed it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The house was quiet save for the low hum of music coming from a speaker somewhere—a piano instrumental, mellow and slow, curling through the air like smoke. Agatha’s house felt lived-in in a way Rio hadn’t noticed the night before. There were books stacked on every surface, half-used candles, a coat draped over the back of a chair like it hadn’t quite made it to the hook.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And in the kitchen, there she was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness. Dressed in a loose black sweater and soft pants, hair half-pinned up, a mug in one hand and a spatula in the other as she flipped something on a skillet. She glanced over her shoulder when Rio walked in, raising one brow with the casual ease of someone who made breakfast after mystical breakdowns all the time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning, sleeping beauty,” she said, her voice light but kind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rubbed the back of her neck. “I… didn’t mean to sleep in so late.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You nearly conjured a hurricane last night. I think you earned a few extra hours of sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a soft laugh and leaned against the doorframe. “You make that sound normal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned back to the pan. “Normal’s a moving target around here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a pause. Then Rio asked, a little quieter, “You always this calm the morning after a storm?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t turn around, but there was a smile in her voice. “Only when I know it’s passed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She slid something onto a plate and set it on the kitchen island. Toast. Eggs. Something that looked like sautéed mushrooms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For you. You need something in your system.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moved forward slowly, looking at the plate like it might disappear. “Didn’t know you were the nurturing type.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha poured her a cup of coffee. “Don’t spread it around. I do have a reputation to uphold.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took the mug with a grin, their fingers brushing again—just lightly this time. Enough to make the light above them flicker, like it was holding its breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked up at Agatha. “So that’s going to keep happening?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finally met her gaze. “For now. Until you learn how to control it. Or direct it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re gonna teach me how?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll try,” Agatha said. “If you let me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her for a long moment, heart unspooling a little more with every second. Then she nodded once and sat down with her breakfast, steam rising in lazy spirals from her plate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha poured herself another mug of coffee and sat across from her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For now, that was enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The quiet between them had just started to settle into something comfortable again when the front door flung open with a gust of cold wind, and Wanda Maximoff stormed in like she was the weather.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood so fast her chair scraped back across the floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda?” she snapped, eyes narrowing. “What the hell—?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you feel that storm last night?” Wanda didn’t wait to be invited in. She shed her red coat in a huff and tossed it over the back of a nearby chair like she owned the place. Her hair was still damp, her boots tracked in mud, and she looked frazzled in a way Agatha hadn’t seen since the last time a hex went sideways.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I felt it,” Agatha said, folding her arms. “I was in it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought something was wrong, I almost called—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stopped short, mid-sentence. Her eyes had just landed on Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, still sitting at the kitchen table in one of Agatha’s oversized flannel shirts, a half-drunk mug of coffee in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda blinked. Once. Then her eyes slowly cut back to Agatha. “</span>
<em>
<span>Seriously</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cleared her throat. “Wanda, you remember Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We met. Briefly.” Wanda gave Rio a once-over—less judgmental, more curious. She stepped closer. “You were at the apothecary. Bought lavender, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh,” Rio said, caught between defensive and awkward. “Yeah. That was me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda turned back to Agatha, voice low but still sharp. “You didn’t think to mention that she was here when I showed up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t give me a chance, did you? You just barged in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s literally the eye of the storm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha winced. Rio straightened in her chair. “Excuse me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda looked back at her, then sighed and dropped the edge. “Sorry. That was rude. It’s just…” She looked at Agatha again. “You tell her yet?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Part of it,” Agatha said. “That’s how the storm happened.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced between them, brow furrowed. “Okay. Someone needs to start explaining things to me like I’m five. Because I’m clearly missing chapters in this magic manual.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda studied her for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She knows she’s a witch,” Agatha said quickly. “She doesn’t know… all the rest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s eyes gleamed. “Oh. </span>
<em>
<span>Oh</span>
</em>
<span>. This is  gonna be </span>
<em>
<span>fun</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda just smiled at Rio, more kindly this time. “Welcome to the madness, sweetheart. Oh, you have no idea what you got yourself into.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood abruptly and muttered something about needing a word with Wanda before grabbing her friend by the elbow and steering her out of the kitchen and into the living room. Rio stayed frozen in her chair, only half-listening as Mr. Scratchy, Agatha’s pet rabbit, hopped onto her lap and settled in comfortably. She didn’t mean to eavesdrop. Not really. But the cottage was old, the walls thin, and neither of them had closed the door behind them.</span>
</p><p><span>“You didn’t,” Wanda was whispering, delighted. “</span><em><span>You</span></em> <em><span>didn’t</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p>
<span>“Wanda—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my God, you did! Didn’t I tell you it would happen? I told you!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We didn’t,” Agatha hissed, her tone low and firm. “Nothing happened. She stayed the night because it was starting to storm, and I wasn’t about to let her drive home drunk and emotionally unstable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t even kiss her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shame,” Wanda muttered. “You’ve been out of the game so long I thought you were going to combust. I figured if anything could break the spell, it would be a beautiful woman with enormous eyes and the temperament of a bristling cat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, okay.” A beat. “But you want to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer right away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed hard and quickly looked away, heart thudding so loudly she was sure Mr. Scratchy could hear it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t trying to listen. Not trying. But… well. Now that she had.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers tightened around her mug as her mind spun in a dozen directions at once. She wasn’t blind. Of course she’d noticed Agatha. How could she not? That woman walked into a room like she owned it, all quiet confidence and glacial elegance. The blue of her eyes was criminal—like summer skies after a storm, and the depths of an ocean you could drown in if you weren’t careful. And don’t even get her started on that long, dark hair or the way her voice had a way of curling around words like secrets she wasn’t ready to share.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then there was the other stuff. The little things. The dry humor. The sharpness. The way she’d looked at Rio like she saw her—even when Rio had barely seen herself these last few months.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah, she had definitely noticed Agatha Harkness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And now she couldn’t stop wondering what it would feel like if something </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She ran a hand through her hair and muttered under her breath. “Jesus Christ, Vidal. Get it together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mr. Scratchy twitched his nose at her, unbothered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha returned to the kitchen first, followed closely by Wanda, whose grin could only be described as… unholy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried to pretend she hadn’t heard a word. That she had to stop herself from pressing her ear to the wall like some lovesick idiot, heart hammering in her throat. That her ears weren’t still burning, or that she wasn’t gripping her coffee mug like it might save her from spontaneously combusting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kept her gaze fixed on the table, on the faded rings of old water damage in the wood grain. If she looked up—if she looked up—she’d have to see Agatha, and she wasn’t sure she was ready for that yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Wanda said, a little too brightly, “this is cozy. Morning coffee with a bunny and a—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t finish.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t have to look to know Agatha had shot her one of those looks. Whatever it was, it worked like a spell, because Wanda immediately went silent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, okay,” Wanda said, chuckling as she backed off, hands raised. “I should go. Leave you two to whatever it is you were doing before I rudely interrupted,” She winked—</span>
<em>
<span>winked</span>
</em>
<span>—at Rio, and then padded off down the hall, still humming under her breath like this was all the most delightful thing she’d ever seen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The second the door clicked shut behind her, Rio let out a breath she didn’t know she’d been holding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved around the kitchen like nothing was out of place, graceful and calm, pouring herself a fresh cup of coffee. She leaned back against the counter, one hand tucked in her pocket, the other lifting the mug to her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like none of it had happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like she hadn’t just healed Rio the night before with magic—actual magic—and like Rio hadn’t just overheard Wanda gleefully assuming they’d slept together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Agatha said at last, in that maddeningly even tone, “you and Mr. Scratchy seem to have bonded.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced down at the rabbit still lounging in her lap like he paid rent. His eyes were half-lidded with contentment, and she swore he smirked when she looked at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I guess I’ve been chosen,” she muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a sip of her coffee. “He’s not usually that affectionate. Must be something about you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s pulse stuttered. She looked up, slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face gave away nothing. But there was something in her eyes—just a flicker—like she knew. Like she definitely knew Rio had heard every word of that conversation and was now doing mental gymnastics just to hold eye contact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe it’s the storm residue,” Rio offered weakly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe,” Agatha echoed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A silence stretched between them, heavier than before. But it wasn’t uncomfortable. Not exactly. Just… full.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t know what she’d expected, waking up in Agatha’s house after the night they’d had. But she hadn’t expected this: sitting here in her oversized borrowed t-shirt, with Agatha across the room, looking like the storm hadn’t touched her at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She still looked like an enchantress pulled straight from a dream. Or a fever. Or both.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t know what was happening. Not really. But she knew this—whatever this was—wasn’t over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And maybe… maybe she didn’t want it to be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha insisted on walking with her. It wasn’t a long way—just down the winding street to where Rio had left her car near the bar they’d met in the night before—but something about the gesture made Rio’s chest feel tight in a strange, quiet way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They didn’t talk much. The sun was just beginning to peek through the thick cloud cover, everything smelling of damp earth and fresh rain. The town was still, as if holding its breath after the storm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their footsteps crunched over the gravel, and every so often, Agatha’s arm would brush against Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried not to think about the night before. The lightning. The warmth of Agatha’s hand pressed to her skin. The way she’d said “I couldn’t not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the memory was persistent, curling around the edges of her thoughts like smoke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they reached the car, Rio turned to face her, one hand on the door handle. “Thanks for… you know, everything,” she said, not sure how else to put it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, that unreadable expression back on her face. “You’re welcome.” Then, after a pause: “Take it easy today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a small smile, not quite meeting her eyes. “I’ll try.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither of them moved for a beat too long. Then Agatha stepped back, and Rio slid into the driver’s seat. As she pulled away, she glanced into the rearview mirror.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was still there, standing in the gray morning light, arms folded loosely across her chest, watching her go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The drive back was quiet. The trees lining the road swayed gently in the post-storm breeze, and the ground sparkled with dew and fallen petals. Rio tapped her fingers against the steering wheel, the silence in the car louder than any thunder had been the night before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she turned the last corner toward the cottage, she felt it before she saw him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Salem was waiting on the porch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The gray cat sat with the same regal indifference as ever, his tail curled neatly around his paws, his green eyes fixed on the drive like he’d known exactly when she’d pull in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked and let out a breath of something between a laugh and a sigh. “Of course you’re there,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She parked, grabbed her keys, and jogged up the path—only to curse under her breath when the porch creaked under her weight, a few warped boards visibly splintering under her feet. The storm had done a number on it, and her body weight alone made it feel like one strong wind might finish the job.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Salem trotted toward the door, unbothered by the damage. Rio followed more cautiously, her eyes scanning the loose nails and bowed planks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she muttered. “You win. I’ll find someone in town to fix it. This thing’s going to collapse and take me with it if I don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Salem meowed once in response and darted inside the moment she opened the door, like he owned the place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe he did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lingered in the doorway for a second, hand resting on the frame as she looked out toward the trees, still shivering in the breeze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something had changed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not just the porch. Not just the storm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something in her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she didn’t know what it meant yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she knew she wasn’t alone in it anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, the cottage felt warm and welcoming in a way Rio hadn’t fully appreciated before. Maybe it was just the contrast from the charged air of Agatha’s house, or maybe it was the presence of a gray cat now weaving around her legs like he belonged there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kicked off her boots and let her bag fall with a soft thud by the door, stretching her arms over her head as she yawned. Her body ached in all the places leftover adrenaline always left behind—shoulders tight, neck sore, something deeper in her chest still humming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Salem jumped up onto the kitchen chair and meowed once, expectantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, okay,” she said, padding barefoot across the wood floor. “Breakfast coming right up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She found the bag of food she’d picked up yesterday, opened it, and poured a generous helping into a ceramic dish she’d bought on impulse. The cat sniffed it once before digging in like he hadn’t eaten in days.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned against the counter, arms crossed, watching him. “You really are something else,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He flicked an ear but didn’t stop eating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She made herself some coffee, the familiar routine of it grounding her, and then walked back toward the kitchen table, mug in hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That’s when she saw it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a book sitting in the center of the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She froze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It hadn’t been there when she left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She would’ve noticed—it was thick and old-looking, with a cracked leather cover and yellowed pages that looked like they’d lived through decades. Maybe longer. The front was embossed with delicate symbols that shimmered faintly when the sunlight touched them just right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And there, scrawled on the inside of the cover in looping, old-fashioned script:</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eliza Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath caught in her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t seen this before. Not once, in all the hours spent exploring the cottage, in all the times she’d looked through drawers and cabinets for any trace of her family. It had never turned up. Not even once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She set the mug down slowly and reached out, fingertips brushing the worn cover.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Salem hopped up onto the table beside it, tail curling around his paws again. His green eyes locked with hers like he knew exactly what this was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And maybe he did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened the book.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The pages smelled like herbs and smoke and old paper. Inside, the words were handwritten in fading ink, the margins filled with doodles of plants and stars, symbols and notes in a tidy, elegant script. It wasn’t just a book.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a grimoire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her chest tightened again—but this time, not with fear. With something more complex. Wonder. Curiosity. A sliver of longing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eliza’s grimoire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her family.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat down slowly, flipping the first page with care. Salem lay beside the book, his body warm and steady against her arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Outside, the wind rustled the trees softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, Rio began to read.</span>
</p><p> </p>

<p>
<span>Saturday afternoon at the apothecary was usually quiet, and Agatha liked it that way. She had come in, tended to a few customers and closed around 4pm. A nice, easy day in her book.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had just locked up the apothecary for the afternoon and was tucking her keys into her coat pocket when she heard it—the high, chirpy laugh that made her shoulders tense without fail.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha Harkness!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned, just in time to see Mayor Sharon Davis bustling across the street in a tailored pastel coat and kitten heels that somehow managed not to trip her on the cobblestones. Her hair was its usual fluffy halo of short, butter-blonde curls, and a silk scarf fluttered dramatically around her neck like she was expecting to be painted mid-step.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mayor Davis,” Agatha said, forcing a smile as Sharon approached like a runaway shopping cart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Out and about, I see,” Sharon chirped, looping an arm through Agatha’s like they were old friends. “It’s not often I catch you during business hours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was just closing up,” Agatha said, slipping her arm free as gently as she could. “Busy day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I don’t doubt it. All that tincture brewing and potion-making—I imagine you’re practically a cauldron yourself by the end of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had to control the urge to roll her eyes. “Something like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sharon gave another one of her trademark staccato laughs and leaned in conspiratorially, lowering her voice but not enough to be subtle. “I hear you and the new girl in town are spending an awful lot of time together these days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s posture stiffened slightly. “Word travels fast.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course it does.” Sharon beamed. “Small town. You know how it is. People notice things. Like the fact that she left your house early this morning?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gave a knowing wink that made Agatha want to hex something. But instead, she smoothed her face into something neutral and shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She needed a place to wait out the storm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmm,” Sharon hummed. “I’m sure it was all very cozy. Well. I do hope she’s settling in. We’ve all got high hopes for Ms. Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes, just slightly. “Have we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sharon’s smile didn’t flicker, but there was something in her gaze—something just slightly too sharp. “Well, you know me. I like to see newcomers welcomed properly. Integration is important.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond, just watched her, silent and still.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anyway,” Sharon said brightly, breaking the moment with another clap of her hands. “I won’t keep you. Just wanted to say hello. You know where to find me if you need anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure I’ll manage,” Agatha replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sharon’s laughter followed her down the street like the tail end of a bad spell, lingering longer than it had any right to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her go, brow furrowing. Sharon was always a bit much, but something about the whole interaction felt… off. Like the air before a lightning strike.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She slipped her hands into her pockets and started toward her car, muttering under her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gods, that woman gives me hives.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was just past seven when Agatha found herself standing on Rio Vidal’s battered porch, a paper bag balanced in one arm, the other hand raised to knock—but hesitating. The porch creaked beneath her boots, groaning like it resented the company. The storm had definitely made things worse; one of the railings hung askew, and a board by the step looked ready to give at the slightest weight. She made a mental note to come back and fix it herself if Rio didn’t call someone soon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Salem’s eyes appeared in the window, glowing faintly in the dim light, as if he’d known she was coming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She knocked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A moment passed, then the sound of footsteps on hardwood. The door opened, and there stood Rio, barefoot in a pair of loose plaid pajama pants and an oversized tee, hair pulled up in a messy bun that still managed to look infuriatingly good on her. Her eyes widened slightly in surprise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I come bearing gifts,” Agatha said dryly, lifting the bag. “Don’t read into it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, then stepped back, opening the door wider. “Are you here to tell me I’ve developed a tail or started speaking in tongues or something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a short huff of a laugh as she walked in. “No. Just… checking in. It was a lot to dump on someone in one night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shut the door and turned to her, brows raised. “So you brought…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A care package.” Agatha set the bag on the kitchen table and began unpacking it with casual precision. “Lavender tea. A little protective charm to keep your dreams calm. And chocolate. Obviously.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, visibly caught off guard. “You brought me chocolate?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not a monster.” Agatha shrugged. “Plus, I had an extra bar in the cupboard.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s…” Rio trailed off, then offered a tentative smile. “That’s actually really thoughtful. Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha waved it off, already regretting coming. “Just figured you might be spiraling.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back against the counter, crossing her arms. “You wouldn’t be wrong. I tried to write or draw today and all I could think about was… glowing hands. And thunderstorms. And my leg healing in front of my eyes like I was in an episode of The X-Files.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head. “Were you Agent Scully or the monster of the week?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a tired laugh. “Jury’s still out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stood in silence for a beat. Salem brushed up against Agatha’s leg and she glanced down, arching a brow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He likes you,” Rio said, watching them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He has good taste,” Agatha murmured, scratching behind his ears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another pause.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want some tea?” Rio asked. “I feel like you don’t do herbal, but I have black.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll take whatever you’re having,” Agatha replied. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded and went to put the kettle on, her movements a little more relaxed now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her for a long moment, then said, almost too casually, “You’re handling this better than most people would.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not sure I am,” Rio said softly, not looking up. “But you showing up like this? It definitely helps.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked away, not used to being the one that helped. “Well. Good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The tea had steeped just long enough to fill the cottage with a soft, herbal warmth. Rio handed Agatha a mug, their fingers brushing, and the overhead light gave a tiny flicker. Neither of them mentioned it. It was starting to feel… normal. Or, at least, normal for them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They settled into the living room, Rio curling up on the couch with one leg tucked under her, Agatha taking the armchair across from her, a blanket tossed casually over her lap. Salem had claimed the rug in front of the fireplace, paws tucked beneath him like a little gray loaf. Occasionally, he’d flick an ear or glance at Agatha with his gleaming green eyes, but he seemed more content than curious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The quiet was a companion for a while—comfortable, easy. The storm had passed. The air felt clearer, even with the weight of the day still hovering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a sip of her tea, then set the mug down. “So, something kind of weird happened this morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted a brow, her lips curving into something between a smirk and genuine interest. “Weirder than the part where I casually told you you’re a witch?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Comparable,” Rio said dryly, then hesitated. “I found a book. On my kitchen table. Just… sitting there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha straightened, setting her own tea aside. “What kind of book?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Old. Leatherbound. Beautiful, honestly. And it had a name inside—Eliza Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “You’re sure?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t exactly know a lot of people named Eliza Vidal, so yeah. Pretty sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The shift in Agatha’s expression was subtle, but Rio noticed it. She was getting good at noticing her now—the quiet way her emotions moved behind her eyes, the slight tensing of her shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was her grimoire,” Agatha said, voice low. “Her personal book of magic. Her spells. Her thoughts. Her legacy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d never seen it before,” Rio said, a little too quickly. “It was just there. I swear it wasn’t there before. And I don’t exactly have a shelf labeled ‘Witchcraft, Probably’.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I believe you.” Agatha leaned forward, elbows on her knees. “That book finding you? That’s not an accident.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her, unsettled. “Books don’t find people, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They do,” Agatha said, “when they’re tied to blood and power. When they’re waiting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice dropped to a whisper. “You think it was waiting for me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly. “I think it was waiting for you to be ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a beat of silence, save for the soft crackle of the fireplace and Salem’s barely audible purr.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When I opened it,” Rio said, “it felt like something recognized me. Like the book breathed when I touched it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t speak for a long moment. Then, softly: “It did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced down at her hands, then back up. “What does that mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha met her gaze, steady and warm. “It means you’re not just someone who stumbled into a storm or dreamed a cat into existence. You’re part of this. And that book… it’s only the beginning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back against the cushions, exhaling slowly. Salem hopped up beside her, curling into her side as if he’d done it a thousand times before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She rested a hand on his back, fingers brushing his fur. “I thought I was going crazy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not,” Agatha said gently. “But your world is about to get a whole lot stranger.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The fire cracked softly in the hearth, casting golden shadows across the living room. Agatha sat curled at one end of the couch, legs tucked beneath her, her gaze steady but unreadable. Salem had claimed the other corner, his dark body a quiet, watchful shape against the cushions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio suddenly straightened. “Wait—I left it in the kitchen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “The grimoire?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, pushing the blanket off her legs. She stood and padded barefoot toward the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched Rio disappear into the kitchen with the quiet grace of someone still unsure of their footing. The storm from the night before had passed, but there was a different kind of electricity now—settled just under Rio’s skin. Agatha could feel it humming between them, low and insistent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled and leaned back slightly on the couch, her gaze drifting to the fire. Salem remained curled up at the other end, watching her with those unnervingly perceptive green eyes. “Don’t look at me like that,” she murmured, just as Rio returned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And gods help her—there it was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The grimoire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat forward instinctively as Rio approached, the weight of the book heavy in her arms. Even from where she sat, Agatha could feel the pulse of old magic emanating from it—familiar, wild, unmistakable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eliza’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat down beside her, close enough that their knees almost touched, and laid the grimoire between them like it was something sacred. And in a way, it was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I barely opened it,” Rio said quietly, her voice edged with hesitation and wonder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha set her mug down on the little wooden side table and glanced toward the grimoire resting on the couch beside Rio, its leather cover now dulled with age but still pulsing faintly beneath the candlelight. The thing had weight—not just physical, but emotional, magical. An echo of someone long gone and a future not yet shaped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached for it, fingers brushing the edge. “I figured we could go through some of it, maybe. Together?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was something hesitant in her voice, something almost hopeful, and Agatha felt it like a pressure behind her ribs. She hesitated, then sat forward slightly, hands clasped between her knees.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to,” she said gently. “And I will. But Rio… a grimoire is deeply personal. It’s not just a spellbook or some kind of manual. It’s your bloodline speaking to you. Your family’s magic, shaped through their eyes. It was meant for </span>
<em>
<span>you.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked down at it, brows furrowed. “But I don’t even know what I’m supposed to do with it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know.” Agatha softened. “Which is why I think you need a moment with it. Alone. To see what it wants to show you first. Once you’ve had that, once it’s opened to you in the way only it can… then I can help you make sense of it. I’ll answer whatever you want to ask. I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was silence, but not the uncomfortable kind. Rio nodded slowly, dragging her fingers along the spine of the book before carefully setting it down again, like it might shatter if handled wrong.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That makes sense,” she said at last. “It feels like it’s waiting for me to do something anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood, stretching a little. “Then let it. When you’re ready, I’ll be here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their eyes met across the space, something unspoken hanging in the air between them again. Not quite longing. Not quite fear. Something more fragile, and infinitely more dangerous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The wind had quieted, replaced by the delicate hush of snow brushing against the windows, slow and lazy. It fell in thick flakes, blanketing the trees and roof in a soft white hush. Inside the cottage, the fire crackled in its stone hearth, the warmth licking at the edges of the room but not quite enough to chase the chill.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood, padding barefoot across the rug. She caught Agatha’s eyes as she reached for a second wineglass from the open cabinet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Want some?” she asked, lifting the wine bottle from the counter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, curled into the corner of the couch with her legs tucked beneath her, smiled in that calm, quiet way of hers—like she knew how the story would end, and she was simply watching it unfold. “Only if you’re having one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio poured. Handed her the glass. Then paused in front of the fireplace, arms folded. “We might need more logs.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head slightly, then, without moving from her spot, lifted her hand. Just a slow wave through the air, fingers curling at the end like a conductor finishing a note.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The fire responded instantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It flared—not wildly, not dangerous, just brighter, fuller, the flames licking higher like they’d been waiting for her touch. The warmth rolled out toward them in a rush, wrapping the room in a golden glow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mouth opened, then closed. Then opened again. “You just…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched one perfectly sculpted brow, the faintest hint of a smirk at the corner of her lips. “Added a log. Sort of.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her for another beat, then dragged a hand through her hair and muttered, “Okay. Cool. No big deal. Just… casual firebending in my living room.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Technically, it’s not firebending,” Agatha said, taking a sip of wine. “But I’m flattered you think it’s that cool.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It </span>
<em>
<span>is </span>
</em>
<span>that cool,” Rio said, still stunned, her gaze flicking from Agatha’s fingers to the fireplace and back again. “God. You’re like… you’re like straight out of a fantasy movie or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed at that—an actual laugh, low and warm and soft. “That might be the best compliment I’ve gotten in years.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat down next to her, the heat from the flames now a steady hum against her skin. “This is going to take some getting used to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head toward her, blue eyes bright and steady. “I’ll help you. If you want me to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio met her gaze and held it. “Yeah. I think I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sank deeper into the couch, her fingers curled around a glass of red wine as the snow outside thickened, soft and steady, turning the world beyond the windows into a blur of white. The fire crackled steadily in the hearth, painting everything in amber and gold. Across from her, Rio sat cross-legged on the rug, legs tucked under her, nursing her own glass with both hands like it was something sacred. She looked cozy, but alert—like a cat half-asleep and ready to bolt at the first sign of danger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were still circling each other in some way. Friends, yes—but edging toward something else. Agatha felt it like a second heartbeat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” she said lightly, swirling her wine, “Los Angeles. What was it like living in the land of sunshine and spiritually bankrupt smoothies?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed under her breath. “Honestly? Exhausting. Too much noise. Too many people pretending everything’s fine while they’re crumbling inside.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, intrigued. “Ah, a city full of liars.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And actors,” Rio added, smirking faintly. “Which is kind of the same thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised her glass in a mock toast. “To brutal honesty.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tapped her glass against Agatha’s and took a slow sip. “It wasn’t all bad. I had my studio. Friends. Alice. I just… lost my way, I guess. The breakup, the creative block. I kept waiting to feel like myself again, and then one day I realized I didn’t even know what that meant anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a vulnerability in her voice that tugged at Agatha unexpectedly, like a soft pull behind the ribs. She said nothing at first, just watched Rio’s face in the firelight. The shadows clung to her jawline, danced over her lips. She looked older than her years in that moment. Wiser, worn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe you weren’t supposed to go back to the old version of yourself,” Agatha said quietly. “Maybe the old you was never the full story.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked at her, a flicker of something unreadable in her expression—but she didn’t have time to respond.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s phone was suddenly buzzing on the coffee table. Agatha glanced at the name: </span>
<em>
<span>Alice Wu.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a panicked, exasperated sound. “God, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched a brow, sipping her wine. “Who’s that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, a short, exasperated laugh escaping her. “My best friend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re not going to accept her call?” Agatha asked curiously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Trust me, she’s a lot. You don’t want to meet her like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned. “ Oh, I beg to differ.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a pleading look, but answered the FaceTime call anyway. Agatha caught the flash of the screen just as it connected—Alice’s face appeared in motion-blur, her voice already halfway into a sentence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“—seriously, are you alive or did you get abducted by woodland cryptids? I haven’t heard from you in a couple of days and—wait. </span>
<em>
<span>Wait</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s face froze. Then her grin widened, teeth bared like a fox with a secret.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio Marie Vidal. Who. Is. That.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio muttered, “Alice, I swear to—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that the mysterious woman from the apothecary?” Alice’s eyes lit up. Rio blushed. “That </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> her, isn’t it? You did not tell me she was this hot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted a hand in a casual wave, amused. “Good evening.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice blinked, then let out a delighted laugh. “She has a voice, too. Are you kidding me, Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked like she wanted the floorboards to crack open and swallow her whole. “This is Agatha. We’re just hanging out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh-huh,” Alice said, narrowing her eyes at the background. “With wine. And a fire. On a Saturday night. In your little haunted cottage in the woods.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not haunted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not what you said when the pipes made those death-rattle noises.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips twitched. “The ambiance is charming.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice leaned even closer to her camera. “Okay, but for real—Rio, you have your soft voice on. The one you only use when you like someone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You do,” Alice said. “It’s the same one you used when you had that three-month crush on your barista and couldn’t order coffee without blushing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned, full of interest now. “</span>
<em>
<span>Oh</span>
</em>
<span>? Do tell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, don’t,” Rio said, mortified, but her voice cracked with laughter. “Please ignore her. She’s impossible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha found herself smiling. “I think I like her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s dangerous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dangerous how?” Alice cut in. “Do you mean charismatic, funny, and deeply insightful?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled hard, clearly resigning herself to the chaos. “Can we not do this right now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, of course, was already filing away every detail. Rio’s flushed cheeks. The sleeve-fiddling. The fact that she looked absolutely helpless when flustered—endearing and sharp and soft in all the ways Agatha didn’t expect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice sighed dramatically, clearly enjoying herself. “Fine, fine. I’ll let you get back to your very cozy, very suspiciously romantic-sounding night with Miss Gorgeous-Dark-and-Witchy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “Witchy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vibe,” Alice said quickly. “Witchy vibe. You know. Mysterious. Smarter than everyone. It’s a thing. I mean it as a compliment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. “I’ll take it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice winked. “You should. It was really nice to meet you, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You too, Alice. I’d love to hear more about Rio’s tells some other time,” Agatha teased and Rio groaned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bye, Alice!” Rio finally ended the call with a sigh, setting the phone face-down on the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned in slightly, one brow raised. “You’re very cute when you panic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm.” She sipped her wine. “I’m serious.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned and flopped back on the rug, staring up at the ceiling. “She’s never going to let this go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I certainly hope not,” Agatha said, voice smooth. “She’s a goldmine of information.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shot her a look. “You’re enjoying this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Immensely.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, silence settled between them again—but it wasn’t uncomfortable. If anything, it was warmer now, laced with a new current of awareness. Agatha watched the way Rio’s eyes flicked toward the fire, then back to her wineglass, then—briefly—to Agatha herself, before darting away again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Definitely a sleeve-tugger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tucked that knowledge away like a secret, smiling softly into her glass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The phone was facedown now, the chaotic energy of Alice Wu gone with it, but the echo of her mischief lingered in the room like the remnants of a spell. Agatha watched Rio carefully as she took another sip of wine, her expression still tinged with secondhand embarrassment, but her body had relaxed into something quieter. Something open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha waited a moment before speaking, letting the fire crackle between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” she said softly, “Los Angeles.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, then gave a small nod, curling her legs beneath her as she joined Agatha on the couch, her body turned to her. “What about it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You mentioned you hated it,” Agatha said. “I’m curious how you ended up there in the first place.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a flicker in Rio’s eyes—guarded, thoughtful. She looked into her glass like it might hold the answer. Then, after a beat, she exhaled a slow breath and glanced over at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You ever have one of those moments where you just… go? Without thinking too hard about what it means?” she asked. “I was twenty-two. Had some money saved. I’d just gotten my degree and the city felt like this—this vortex of possibility. Like if I stayed still, I’d drown.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha listened, the softness in Rio’s voice coaxing her to lean just slightly closer. Their knees brushed when Rio shifted, and neither of them moved away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Someone I knew back then said LA was the kind of place that either eats you alive or forces you to evolve. I thought I could evolve,” Rio said, her voice wry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A small smile played on Rio’s lips. “I think I did. Just not in the way I expected.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a long pause. The fire cracked again, and this time, Rio leaned back against the couch cushions—closer, without meaning to, or maybe meaning to just enough. Her arm stretched out over the back of the couch and pressed lightly against Agatha’s, just a whisper of contact, but it sent a slow spark across Agatha’s skin. She didn’t pull away. In fact, she angled slightly toward it, her fingers brushing Rio’s wrist as she set her wineglass down on the side table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kept her voice casual, but there was something more beneath it. “So you ran to LA to escape being stuck.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded and glanced over at her. “And you? Did you run here to disappear?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched a brow, amused by the reversal. “Would you believe me if I said no?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio said, a smile tugging at her lips. “Not at all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, eyes drifting to the firelight dancing along the lines of Rio’s profile. “Fair enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their arms were still pressed together. A small, accidental touch—but not an unwelcome one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers tapped absently against her thigh, and Agatha noticed the way her gaze had gone slightly distant. Contemplative. Her voice, when it came again, was softer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was tired of being invisible,” Rio said. “In foster care, you learn early how to make yourself smaller. Easier to ignore. It was survival. But LA… I thought maybe I could be seen there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest tightened, her instinct to reach for her gently warring with the knowledge that now wasn’t the time to push. So instead, she simply said, “And were you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her. Their eyes met. A beat passed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I’m just now figuring out what that even means.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something in Agatha’s throat caught, but she masked it with a slow nod and a quiet murmur of agreement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice was soft, careful. “What about you? You ever leave Thistle Grove?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze drifted toward the fire, wine glass cradled loosely in her fingers. The snow outside painted soft light across the room, but it was the question that made the air shift.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did,” she said finally. “College in New York. Then… Med school. Columbia.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, visibly surprised. “Med school?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed a wry laugh. “Don’t sound so shocked. I used to be very impressive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You </span>
<em>
<span>are</span>
</em>
<span> very impressive,” Rio said, without thinking. Her cheeks flushed almost immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t comment on that, but the corner of her mouth quirked. “I thought—if I already knew how to heal with magic, why not do it the regular way too? Help people beyond this town. Use everything I was born with, and everything I could learn.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She paused, the smile fading. Her eyes darkened, but not in anger. Just memory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It didn’t go how I thought it would.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned slightly, drawing her knees up beneath her on the couch. Her hand brushed against Agatha’s knee again, this time intentional. “What happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice dropped. “I couldn’t turn it off. The knowing. The way my magic works—it’s not just touching wounds and knitting them back together. It’s seeing. Outcomes. Possibilities. I’d touch a patient and know if they were going to die. Or suffer. Or recover, but never be whole.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She picked up her glass and took a sip of her wine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And the worst part was—I couldn’t always do anything about it. Not without revealing what I was. Not without paying the price. Magic doesn’t just take from you—it takes from somewhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression softened with something like awe. “That must’ve been… unbearable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze met hers, steady now. “It broke me, a little. To have the power and still feel helpless.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence settled between them like snowfall—gentle, quiet, full of weight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I dropped out after my third year,” Agatha added after a moment. “Came back to Thistle Grove. Back to potions and insomnia and migraines and stubborn townies who don’t want to see a regular doctor. And that was… enough. Mostly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mostly?” Rio echoed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes traced her face slowly. “There are still days I wonder if I could’ve done more. Been more. But I think I was trying to fix something in myself, more than anyone else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t say anything right away. She just shifted closer, her body angled toward Agatha’s, her fingers gently touching her hand. The contact was casual—but deliberate. Grounding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not broken,” Rio said, and it wasn’t soft, or tentative. It was certain. “And maybe you didn’t become some fancy New York doctor, but you’re helping people here in ways no one else could. That’s not less. That’s… brave.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let the words land, and for a moment, she didn’t feel like brushing them off. For a moment, she let them in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The fire crackled again. The warmth spread.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t move, but she felt the weight of the moment settle in her chest like a second heartbeat. Rio’s words had struck something inside her, something soft and unfamiliar. Not the praise—she was used to admiration, used to people thinking she was sharp or capable or intimidating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But this—being seen as brave? It caught her off guard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could feel the warmth of Rio beside her, their arms brushing, her fingers slowly moving on her wrist. The fire threw flickering gold across Rio’s features, illuminating the quiet in her eyes, the way her lips parted slightly like she might say something else but thought better of it. Agatha’s gaze dropped for just a second to that mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gods, she was beautiful. Not in the sculpted, airbrushed way of magazines or screenplays, but in a way that felt real. Lived-in. Honest. There was something magnetic about her, something that pulled at Agatha in a way she hadn’t felt in years.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could have leaned in. Just a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she let her fingers graze Rio’s where they rested on the back of the couch. A light touch—feather soft. Intentional.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And like every time before, that touch bloomed magic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The fire flared in the hearth, casting tall shadows that danced across the walls. A faint shimmer traced the space between their hands, golden light that pulsed once—like a heartbeat—and then faded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath hitched, barely audible, and Agatha felt her own pulse respond. Neither of them pulled away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But neither of them pushed forward, either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned her head just enough to look at Rio again. “You have no idea how powerful you are,” she said, quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s throat bobbed. Her voice was barely more than a whisper. “That’s the scary part.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile was small, a curve of understanding. “The most powerful things usually are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat like that for a long while. fingers touching. Hands nearly clasped. The fire crackled, and the snow whispered against the windows like a lullaby.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, Agatha stood, her joints aching slightly from the stillness. “I should get going,” she said softly. “You’ve had enough excitement for one night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up at her, eyes darker now, like the storm outside had settled behind them. “You don’t have to rush off.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated. Then: “If I don’t, I might stay too long.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t answer that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached for her coat. “Read the grimoire,” she said, her voice back to that dry murmur. “Let it speak to you. Then we’ll talk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss to her cheek before making her way to the door. Turning back one last time. Rio was still sitting on the couch, fingers touching her cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled faintly. “Goodnight, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door closed behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the spark still hung in the air.</span>
</p><p> </p>

<p>
<span>The cottage was quiet when Rio woke up the next morning. Still. A soft kind of quiet that felt layered and thoughtful, like the house itself was giving her space to think.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Outside, snow had dusted the trees in thin white veils, branches weighed down just enough to droop gently. She pulled on thick socks and made herself tea instead of coffee—her usual routine already felt too harsh, too grounded in a life that had no place for the things she now knew.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the Grimoire waited.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was still on the kitchen table where she’d left it last night, as if it had always belonged there. The air around it felt charged. Or maybe that was her imagination. Still, when she reached out to touch it, her fingers hovered for just a moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she opened it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The handwriting was elegant and sharp, like the idea she had of the woman herself. Eliza Vidal. Her name felt heavier now. Not just a stranger’s anymore. A connection, however distant, to this strange new reality.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first few entries were practical. Eliza’s handwriting was firm, unadorned. Notes about tinctures, lunar cycles, healing salves. There were sketches in the margins—leaves, roots, strange symbols. Some pages had been revisited and revised. Others were dated decades apart. Rio found herself lingering over the entries from the early 90s, especially the ones that mentioned her name. Not directly—but ‘my granddaughter’, or ‘D’s girl’, scrawled next to certain protective spells.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then came the story.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t titled. It was just… there, nestled between recipes and diagrams, like it had always belonged. A piece of something deeper.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Long before the town, before the roads, before the sea was named, there were three sisters.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>They were not born of flesh, but of storm and soil and flame.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>They walked barefoot through the woods, braided rivers into rope, and taught the moon to rise.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The oldest sister healed with her hands. The second sang to the trees and they listened. The third burned down the night so the morning could be born.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>They loved each other fiercely. But the world feared what they could do.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>So one by one, the sisters were hunted, betrayed, broken. Until only one remained.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She split her soul into three Threads and wove them into the land.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>And she whispered:</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Let those who love fiercely, feel deeply, and burn bright find me again.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio read it slowly. Not skimming, not scanning—reading. Letting it settle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she read, a heat bloomed in her chest, slow and heavy. Not fire—something older. Something that moved through her like recognition. The language was simple, but the meaning felt huge. Impossible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers trembled on the page. She pressed them flat.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Wild Thread.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Body Thread.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Flame Thread.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The illustrations that followed were strange and beautiful. Spirals, circles, tangled lines that seemed to vibrate on the page. One symbol appeared again and again—a simple triple spiral, vines curling around the outer rings. It pulsed behind her eyes like something half-remembered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Eliza’s voice, raw and certain, filled the margins.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“This isn’t magic. It’s memory. It’s legacy. It’s blood.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“When the Threads call, they do not ask. They take root. And they bloom where you break.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closed the book slowly, breath catching.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked at her hands. Nothing had changed—but something had shifted. The air around her was charged. The kind of quiet before a thunderstorm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Outside, the snow kept falling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood, pacing once, twice, then sank onto the couch beside the fire. Salem stretched but didn’t move. She tucked her legs beneath her and stared into the flames.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Well, shit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Later that night, the fire was down to embers, casting slow-moving shadows across the floor. The grimoire lay on the table, closed but not silent. Rio could still feel it humming. Like a heart. Like a question she hadn’t yet dared to ask.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d spent the whole day thinking about the story. About the sisters born of storm and soil and flame. About the Thread of the Wild.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The second sister sang to the trees and they listened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio… she’d always drawn trees first. Always felt safest beneath them, felt a connection to them, to the earth beneath her feet, sketching bark and branch like it mattered more than people. Even now, if she closed her eyes, she could feel the roots of the sycamore outside the cottage. Not literally—but almost. Like it was a rhythm she could tap into.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat back against the couch and stared at the ceiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is ridiculous,” she whispered. “This is ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But her voice didn’t sound sure. And the house didn’t argue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>It began with the sound of waves, though she wasn’t near the ocean.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood at the edge of a forest, the sky above her a pale violet streaked with silver. The trees were impossibly tall, their branches swaying in a wind that didn’t touch her skin. Snowflakes drifted around her in slow, spiraling motion—but when they touched the ground, they bloomed into tiny wildflowers. Purple, blue, white.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air felt dense. Not heavy—meaningful. Like walking into a room where someone had just whispered a secret.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And there, by the roots of a massive sycamore tree, sat a woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Older than Rio, with streaks of gray in her dark hair and a softness around her eyes that felt achingly familiar. She wore a coat the color of dusted pine and boots caked in mud. Her hands were rough and ink-stained.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” the woman said, and just like that—Rio knew her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eliza?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eliza nodded. “It’s good to see you again, my darling child, even if you don’t remember.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth felt dry. “I—I don’t understand. Am I dreaming?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes. But that doesn’t mean it’s not real.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A breeze moved between them, ruffling the leaves, carrying the scent of lavender and smoke. Somewhere, distant and soft, came a familiar sound: Salem’s purr.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve been waiting for you to find the book,” Eliza said, voice quiet. “It knew when the time was right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, her fingers curling into her palms. “You’re my grandmother.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eliza smiled, warm but sad. “And your mother was Daisy. Wild-hearted, stubborn, too smart for her own good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s chest ached at the name. “What happened to her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eliza looked away for a long beat. “She tried to fight what she was. She thought she could outrun it. The Wild Thread doesn’t let go, Rio. It winds itself around your bones. If you don’t walk with it, it pulls you under. And if you can’t control it, others might try to take it from you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what I’m doing,” Rio whispered. “I didn’t even believe in magic until a couple of days ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eliza looked back at her, eyes sharp now—not unkind, but piercing. “You don’t have to know. You just have to listen. To the land. To yourself. To the places where your art becomes more than lines and color. That’s the Thread speaking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart thudded in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There are others,” Eliza said. “Two more. The Flame and the Body. You’ll know them when the time comes. One’s already close.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Eliza… why now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The older woman stepped closer, lifting a hand to brush gently over Rio’s cheek. Her touch was warm. Steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because you were ready. Because the sisters are stirring again. And because you have the chance to do what Daisy couldn’t—stay. Fight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, and Eliza was fading. Her figure growing lighter, like the last burn of a match.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eliza, wait—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t be afraid to feel everything,” came the reply, soft and echoing. “It’s how the Wild survives.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then the forest fell away, and Rio woke up with a start.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The fire was still crackling low in the hearth. Salem was curled on the couch beside her. The grimoire lay on the table—closed, but not quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached for it with trembling fingers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She needed answers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she knew exactly who might be able to give them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The snow had stopped sometime before dawn, leaving the town brushed in soft white, like the dusting of powdered sugar on a cake. The sky was a clear, pale blue—the kind that made the cold air feel clean rather than biting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tucked her scarf tighter around her neck and stepped into The Hollow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bell above the door jingled, and the warmth and scent hit her all at once—freshly brewed coffee, warm sugar, cardamom, and something herbal she couldn’t quite place. Lilia Calderu was behind the counter, wearing a sweater the color of plum jam and a smirk that said she knew far too much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, well,” Lilia said, tapping the espresso machine with one long, ring-heavy finger. “You’re out awfully early for someone who usually only comes for lunch. Did the world end, or are you finally acclimating?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, trying to play it cool. “Just grabbing coffee.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And pastries, huh?” Lilia said, already packing a box. “You’ve got that ‘bringing-offerings-to-a-witch’ look about you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flushed. “She’s not a—okay. Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course she’s not,” Lilia said, and winked. “Tell Agatha I said she owes me a tea blend. And no more pretending she’s too busy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paid and left with two coffees—one black, one with a dash of oat milk—and a box of pastries that smelled like cinnamon. Her boots crunched softly against the snow as she made her way to the apothecary.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sign above the door still creaked when the wind touched it. Inside, it was quiet, warm, and filled with the scent of dried lavender and lemon balm. Sunlight streamed through the front windows, catching in glass jars and bunches of dried herbs strung from the ceiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was behind the counter, scribbling in a thick ledger, her reading glasses low on her nose and her dark hair pinned back in a messy twist. She looked up—and smiled, slow and crooked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning,” she said. “You’re up early. Did something explode?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held up the coffees. “Peace offering. Or bribe. Depends on how you look at it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha came around the counter, peeling off her glasses. “Is that cinnamon I smell?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I figured if I was about to grill you with magical questions, I should bring reinforcements.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took the coffee, fingers brushing against Rio’s, warm and easy. “You learn fast.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio followed her to the back, where the little sitting area was half-shadowed and sunlit at once, books stacked on every surface, and a long window seat that begged to be claimed. They settled in, coffees steaming between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, Rio just watched her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The way Agatha moved, always precise, always thoughtful. The way her smile tilted before it bloomed. She looked more relaxed than Rio had ever seen her—still sharp, still poised, but less like she was bracing for something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio said, tearing into a flaky pastry. “First things first. It’s completely ridiculous that we still don’t have each other’s numbers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked at her. “We don’t?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. We’ve been doing this whole low-key friendship thing, and we’re still operating on walk-ins and psychic timing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted. “I hate that you described it so accurately.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio handed over her phone. “Here. Fix it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their fingers brushed again as Agatha took the phone, and something warm flickered in Rio’s chest. Not magic. Or maybe just a different kind of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wild Thread,” she thought, and her gaze softened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Agatha said after typing, handing it back. “Now you can text me passive-aggressive thoughts about the weather.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or memes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You do seem like a meme sender.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, but then sobered slightly. “I read more of the grimoire yesterday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brow arched. “And?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s a lot I don’t understand,” Rio said. “But there was something about the Threads. Three of them. Sisters. It felt like more than just a story.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back, cradling her coffee. “It is more than a story.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her, steady. “So tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha met her gaze—and the air between them felt charged. Not the kind of static that came before a storm. Something older. Quieter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like the forest was holding its breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth—probably about to say something devastatingly elegant and enlightening about the Threads—when the front bell jingled, sharp and insistent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She blinked once, then sighed, setting her coffee down. “Saved by the bell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled softly as Agatha stood and padded into the front of the shop. Curious, Rio followed a step behind, sipping from her cup just as a burst of cold air swept in along with a familiar voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, look at this! The apothecary is actually open at 9am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mayor Sharon Davis swept into the shop like a cold wind disguised in a burgundy wool coat and matching gloves. Her hair was set in a perfect bob, not a strand out of place, and her lipstick was a shade that said I run things.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mayor Davis,” Agatha greeted smoothly, her voice cool but polite. “What a surprise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Sharon said, flashing a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. Then she turned to Rio, her expression warming a touch. “Ms. Vidal. You’re still here, I see. Enjoying your little… sabbatical?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cleared her throat. “Something like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hm.” Sharon’s gaze flicked between them. “Well, you picked a fine place to spend it. Can’t beat our small-town charm—or our small-town gossip.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t flinch, but Rio could feel the tension settle lightly in the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just came in for some of that headache tincture you made me last fall,” Sharon went on, unbothered. “Worked better than the garbage Dr. Leland prescribed. Not that I’m telling people you’re more effective than our local clinic, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course not,” Agatha said smoothly, already turning to the shelves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lingered behind the counter, eyes dancing with amusement as Sharon glanced around the shop like it might be harboring scandal in its shelves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This place smells better than I remember,” the mayor mused. “Did you change the formula?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha said, handing over a small bottle. “But I did light a new candle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sharon squinted at it, sniffed. “Smells like pine and something… old. Like church wood.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s sage and cedar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, it suits you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sharon paid in crisp bills, then turned to Rio again, her tone turning faux-casual. “We’re doing a little winter fair in the town square next weekend. Art booths, music, cocoa—all that. You should come. Might do you some good to meet more people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll think about it,” Rio said, smiling tightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good.” She gave them both one last look, then sailed out the door, the bell jingling brightly behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A pause.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned to Agatha, wide-eyed. “That woman is terrifying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed under her breath as she slipped behind the counter again. “She always knows more than she lets on. It’s her one true gift.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She was definitely sniffing for drama.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She always is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned on the counter. “I don’t suppose that headache tincture also works on people who talk too much and smell like city council?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. “Only if you drink the whole bottle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They laughed—light, easy. And when the silence returned, it wasn’t awkward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just expectant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should probably ask you those questions now,” Rio said quietly, her hand curling again around her cup. “About the Threads. About everything. Before anyone else comes in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her, slower this time. Steadier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was hoping you would.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned toward the back, nodding her head for Rio to follow. “Come on. It’s quieter back here. And I doubt Sharon will be the last interruption.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The back room of the apothecary was smaller than Rio expected—less “secret potion lab” and more “organized chaos.” Dried herbs hung in bunches from the rafters, their scents earthy and sweet, and a large wooden table took up most of the space, cluttered with vials, books, and mortar bowls. The fire crackled softly in the tiny stove set into the wall, lending the room a cozy glow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio perched on a stool, coffee cup still in hand, her grimoire tucked beneath her arm. She placed it gently on the table, fingers grazing the worn cover like it might vanish again if she let go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” she said, voice softer now. “The Threads. They’re real.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat across from her, folding her hands together. “They are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked down at the book, then back at her. “The Wild Thread… that’s me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, then nodded. “Yes. It’s… not something you choose, exactly. It’s more like it chooses you. Or wakes up in you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed. “It said something about love. And grief. That it usually stirs through those things.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A slow breath from Agatha. “That’s true. The Threads respond to big things. Not just emotions—but shifts. Change. Loss. They run deep in the bloodline, but sometimes they lie dormant for generations.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And they’re not just magic?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha said, her voice steady. “They’re something older. Wilder. Magic is just… what people call it when they don’t understand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, heart picking up. “So if I am one, and you are too…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t look away. “Then we’re tied to something that runs deeper than either of us. And stronger, if we let it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced down again, the weight of the grimoire grounding her. “My grandmother. I think she might’ve been one, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Probably,” Agatha said softly. “Most people don’t know what they are until it’s too late. Or until it starts to burn. And even so, it’s so incredibly rare that all three threads manifest in the same generation. That hasn’t happened in over a hundred years as far as we know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back slightly, overwhelmed but holding her own. “You’re the Body Thread, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze sharpened just slightly. “Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And… Wanda’s the Flame?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded slowly. “So what happens when all three of us are here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could answer, the front bell jingled again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood with a grimace that was almost fond. “Hold that thought.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio offered a lopsided smile as Agatha disappeared into the front again. She could hear the low murmur of greetings, some talk about a seasonal tonic, and the unmistakable sound of someone knocking over a display stand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha returned a minute later, slightly harried, she paused in the doorway and gave Rio a rueful look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should’ve known today would be busier than usual.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow. “It’s the Sharon Davis effect.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned. “Clearly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped back into the room, brushing invisible dust off her sweater. “I’ll probably be stuck up here the rest of the morning… but do you want to meet for lunch? We can finish this conversation properly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, a smile blooming despite the whirlwind of thoughts still stirring in her chest. “Yeah. I’d like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good.” Agatha gave a small, private smile, the kind Rio was beginning to recognize as rare. “There’s a place just off Main Street with good soup and terrible decor. I’ll text you the address,” she paused, then lifted an eyebrow. “Now that we don’t live in the dark ages anymore and actually have each other’s numbers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, putting the grimoire back in her bag. When she left the apothecary a few minutes later, she felt something twist sweetly in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air was cold, but her hands were warm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha Harkness had just asked her to lunch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was just finishing her second coffee of the day and trying not to read the same paragraph in Eliza’s grimoire for the fifth time when her phone buzzed.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha Harkness</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Change of plans. I’m picking you up. There’s a place one town over. Quiet, decent food, and hopefully zero small town eavesdroppers.</span>

</em>
</p><p>
<span>Fifteen minutes later, Agatha was parked outside the cottage in a sleek, dusty black car that looked like it had once been polished to perfection and then absolutely given up halfway through the last decade. Rio stepped outside, buttoning up her coat, and then slid into the passenger seat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t strike me as someone who likes driving out of town,” she said, glancing over at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha put the car in drive with a wry smile. “I don’t. But I like interruptions even less.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed softly, tucking her hands into her lap. “Fair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The drive took just under twenty minutes, winding through a stretch of pine and fog, the kind of road Rio hadn’t realized she missed until she saw it again. Quiet, muted, like the trees themselves were listening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t turn on the radio. She just drove in comfortable silence, the occasional glance out the corner of her eye when Rio shifted or muttered something under her breath while scrolling through her notes app.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, they pulled into the gravel lot of a small, ivy-covered inn that looked like it had once been a house—and probably still was, somewhere behind the dining room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised a brow as they stepped out into the cold. “This doesn’t look like a soup-and-sandwich type of place.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a look over the top of her sunglasses. “They make fresh bread every morning and have a wine list that rivals most places in the city.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio made a low, impressed sound. “You spoil all your friends like this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned toward her with a lazy smirk. “Only the ones who ask magical questions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The inn-turned-restaurant was quiet enough that Rio could hear the soft crackle of the fire and the gentle clink of silverware from a couple at the far end. It smelled like rosemary and melted butter, and the heat from the hearth had finally started to loosen the tension in her shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t realized how tightly she’d been wound until she sat down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her for a moment, then set her spoon down and leaned in, elbows resting casually on the tablecloth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So… we’ve already established that the Thread magic usually stirs when we go through big life changes or emotions. You said you never even heard of this place or Eliza until after the breakup?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s throat tightened. “Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to,” Agatha offered, voice even, unreadable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared down at the dark red wine in her glass, the way it caught the low light like ink. She didn’t have to. But somehow, here, with Agatha watching her—not judging, not pushing, just there—it felt like maybe she could.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was with her for four years,” she said quietly. “Carol. We met at a concert. She was funny and loud and fearless and—” She exhaled. “I was completely in love with her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t interrupt. She didn’t flinch at the name or the confession.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And then I found out she’d been cheating on me for months.” Rio’s mouth twisted into something that wasn’t quite a smile. “With some bartender nearly half her age, barely old enough to be in college.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “It wasn’t just the betrayal. I think part of me had already been unraveling before it happened. I hadn’t drawn anything in months. My publisher was breathing down my neck, and I kept staring at blank pages like they were mocking me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brow furrowed, her gaze narrowing just slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I used to feel like I had this endless well of stories, you know? Like the characters lived in me. But after everything with Carol…” Rio hesitated, fingers tightening slightly around the stem of her glass. “It was like someone turned the faucet off. I had nothing left.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And that’s when things started to shift?” Agatha asked gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah.” Rio nodded slowly. “But the first big thing was getting that letter. And I had this feeling deep inside that I should come here, however bizarre it was to just travel across the country to check out some inheritance from someone I’d never even heard of.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked up, meeting Agatha’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You think it was grief?” Rio asked. “Or heartbreak?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha studied Rio, her expression unreadable for a beat. Then, softly: “I think it was change. You were cracked open by more than just grief or heartbreak. That was just the final straw. And whatever was buried underneath… finally had room to rise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio went quiet at that, swallowing past the tightness in her throat. The fire hissed behind her, and outside, the sky was a soft, pale gray, hinting at snow again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached out, slow and deliberate, and lightly tapped the side of Rio’s glass with her own. “To cracking open.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted, then smiled. “That’s the most poetic toast I’ve ever gotten from someone who tried to walk out of my cottage instead of explaining how the hell a whole bunch of flowers had just bloomed in a frozen patch of earth.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. “Growth.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were halfway through lunch, the kind of meal that stretched without hurry. A breeze stirred through the patio of the little restaurant and the late sunlight hit the edges of Agatha’s dark hair like ink soaked in gold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t said much in the last few minutes. Just listened, eyes fixed on Rio in that way she did—like she was both wary and utterly absorbed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lowered her wine glass and tilted her head slightly. “What about you?” she asked gently. “What brought you back to Thistle Grove?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She looked past Rio, beyond the flower boxes blooming along the railing, out toward the hills. And then she said, quiet and simple, “My mother disappeared when I was twenty-one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, surprised. “Disappeared?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vanished,” Agatha said. “No note. No spell. No body. One day she was there, and the next, she wasn’t. I searched everywhere—mundane and magical. Nothing. Just… gone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She picked at the edge of her napkin. “She was powerful. One of the last women in town who really understood what the Threads were. And I think it scared people. I think it scared her, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice was soft. “Is that when you gave it up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” Agatha’s laugh was dry. “I still thought I could do something good with it back then. I went to med school in New York. Thought, if I could heal with magic, maybe I could do it the regular way too. But it didn’t work. I couldn’t turn it off. Every patient I touched—I could feel it. Whether they’d make it. Whether they wouldn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shook her head slowly. “It hollowed me out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t interrupt. Just waited, letting the silence unfold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I came home,” Agatha said. “Met someone—briefly. Got pregnant. He was long gone before I even showed. And then there was Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She smiled then, the kind of smile that cracked her open, beautiful and broken all at once. “He was everything. Smart. Funny. Loud as hell. I thought, this is it. This is what I was meant to protect.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers tensed slightly around her glass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He got sick when he was five,” Agatha said. “Leukemia. At first I thought—this is the reason I have these powers. This is why I inherited all of it. So I could save him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The light shifted, shadows threading over her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I tried everything,” she whispered. “Spells. Blood rites. Desperate, awful things. But nothing worked. My powers didn’t work on my own flesh and blood and I never understood why. The magic didn’t even flicker. It was like it knew. Like it refused.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes shimmered, but she didn’t look away. She knew what was coming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky died two weeks before his seventh birthday.” Agatha looked down at the table, her voice hoarse. “And that was it. That was the moment everything broke. I stopped calling myself a witch. I buried my grimoire. I didn’t want anything to do with the Threads or the town or the old myths. None of it saved him. None of it meant anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a long silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached out slowly, laying her hand over Agatha’s. Her touch was warm, sure, steady. No pressure. Just presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m so sorry,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked fast and looked away. “I don’t know why I’m telling you this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because I asked,” Rio said gently. “And because you needed to say it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth curved faintly. “You’re annoyingly good at this listening thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve met my best friend. I get a lot of practice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That pulled a small laugh out of Agatha—tired, but real. “He would’ve liked you,” she said softly. “He would’ve asked a thousand questions about your tattoos.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a sad, crooked smile. “I would’ve answered every single one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a while, they just sat there, their hands resting between them like a bridge, thumbs caressing gently over skin. Not lovers. Not yet. But something unmistakably more than friends.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And when Agatha finally looked up again, her gaze was steadier, softer. “So. You and me. We’ve both got ghosts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “Maybe they brought us here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hadn’t let go of Rio’s hand, not really. Their fingers had drifted slightly apart, sure, but they still lingered in the space between them, as if even the silence was charged with something waiting to spark.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was the first to speak again, her voice quieter now, a little hesitant. “Can I ask you something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a sidelong glance. “You already did. A lot of somethings.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled faintly. “This one’s different.” She paused. “What does it actually mean to be a Thread?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back slightly in her chair. The breeze had picked up again, rustling the wildflowers planted along the railing, stirring the edges of the story like it was listening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t answer right away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I read some of Eliza’s Grimoire,” Rio said, before the silence could stretch too long. “She wrote about the Three Sisters. How they weren’t born like us. How they came before the land.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze sharpened, a flicker of something behind her eyes—recognition, maybe. Or wariness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And that when the world broke them apart,” Rio went on softly, “the last one left behind the Threads. So the ones who came after could find each other again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked away, out toward the hills. “That story’s older than anyone in town. No one writes it down, not really. It’s just… passed along. Half-whispered.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But it’s true,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth twitched. “Most dangerous things are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat forward, arms resting on the table now. “I think I’m the Wild Thread. That’s what Eliza wrote about—the one who sings to trees. Makes things grow. Creates.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a slow nod. “You are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “You’re not surprised.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve felt it since the moment we met,” Agatha said. “When you touched me, it was like the world moved. Flowers blooming out of season. Magic humming like it remembered you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled, half in awe. “So… what are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha met her gaze then, steady and solemn. “The Body Thread. The one who feels what others feel. Who heals. Or used to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And Wanda?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Flame,” Agatha said. “She’s always been fire and rage and truth. It burns in her bones. The protector.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head slowly. “So what happens when all three come together again?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eliza’s book mentioned something,” Rio said, lowering her voice, “about the land waking. The sisters returning. And the town changing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “That part of the story… it’s more like a warning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She paused. “The last time the Threads stirred like this, things broke. The town turned on itself. My mother said the land remembers, and it can wake things that are meant to be dormant. Good and bad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s throat felt tight. “And you think it’s happening now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer right away. Then, quietly, “I think it’s trying to. And I think we’re the thread being pulled first.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked down at her hands, palms slightly stained with graphite from her sketches earlier that morning. “It doesn’t feel like power. It feels like… weight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice was gentler now. “Because it is. It’s not just magic—it’s memory. The kind that lives in blood. In love. In loss. The kind that demands something back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up, eyes meeting hers again. “So what do we do with it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her for a long moment. Then she leaned forward, resting her forearms on the table, her face inches from Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We don’t run from it,” she said. “We learn it. We hold it. We decide what it means for us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not asking you to be anything you’re not,” Agatha added. “But if this power is waking up in you… then I’ll be here. To help. If you want me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath caught. “I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t romantic. Not quite. But it was more than friendship. A choice, offered and accepted. A step closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And maybe that was the real power in the Threads—how they pulled you toward the people who saw you, even when you weren’t ready to be seen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>They didn’t say much as they left the restaurant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The check had been paid. The last crumbs of lemon tart were forgotten. And the wind had picked up just enough to make Agatha shrug her coat on tighter as they stepped outside. The air smelled faintly of salt and damp earth, the kind of post-rain crispness that made everything feel a little more real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio slid her hands into the pockets of her jacket. “You want to walk for a bit? I could use some coffee before I turn into the world’s sleepiest witch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. “You had one glass of wine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I’m a lightweight. Don’t judge me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would never,” Agatha said, in a tone that implied she always would.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They walked in companionable silence down the main street, which looked like something out of a postcard—early spring bulbs in planter boxes, string lights still up from the winter festival, the faint sound of a guitar somewhere in the distance. This town was smaller than Thistle Grove, but not entirely unlike it. A place with roots. Secrets. Ghosts that probably wandered around unnoticed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced sideways. “You good?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a little nod, lips pursed. “Just thinking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dangerous habit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You would know,” Rio shot back with a dry smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They ducked into a narrow little coffee shop near the end of the block—bare brick walls, shelves full of mismatched mugs, the smell of fresh espresso curling in the air. Agatha watched Rio order a lavender honey latte and found herself quietly charmed. It felt oddly… tender, this whole day. Even with all the old wounds they’d opened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they stepped back outside, drinks in hand, Rio finally said, “So you’re really not afraid of any of this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow. “You mean the magic? Or the part where the land might rise up and rewrite everything we know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled a laugh into her cup. “Both.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sipped her black coffee. “I’m not afraid of the Threads, if that’s what you’re asking. I’m afraid of what people do when they realize they can’t control them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was quiet for a moment. Then: “I think I’m more afraid of what it’ll ask of me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slowed her pace just slightly. “It might ask for everything,” she said softly. “But it won’t take it unless you offer it. That’s the difference between real power and corruption.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her, really looked. “How do you know that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because I’ve lived both.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was no drama in the way she said it. No performance. Just truth, plain and heavy and lived-in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They reached the edge of a small overlook, where the road dropped into a view of rolling hills and the distant gleam of water. Agatha stopped, letting her gaze sweep over the quiet horizon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not the only one who was born into this without asking,” she said after a moment. “But maybe we were meant to be asked.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood beside her, shoulder brushing hers. “What if I say yes and I don’t know what that means yet?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned toward her, expression unreadable. “Then I’ll stay until you do. And afterwards if you want me to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The wind kicked up a little. Rio’s hair caught in it, wild and dark and curling at the edges. Agatha reached up, almost without thinking, and tucked a strand behind her ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t a kiss. It wasn’t even flirtation. It was something softer. A promise, maybe. Or the beginning of one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t pull away from Agatha’s hand. If anything, she leaned into the touch, her eyes flicking toward Agatha’s face like she was trying to memorize it under this soft, silvery light. There was something different in her expression now—unguarded, maybe, or just tired of holding everything so close to her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t really do this,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Walk?” Agatha asked, a faint smile tugging at the corner of her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let people in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm. And yet here I am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio said, her voice quieter than before. “Here you are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The wind tugged at the hem of her coat, and Agatha took that as a sign—gently hooking her arm through Rio’s as they turned away from the overlook.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They didn’t speak for a few blocks. Just the rhythm of their steps, the occasional clink of to-go cups, the soft hum of early evening settling over everything. The street lights blinked on one by one as they walked, and the world felt far away for a little while—just two women walking slowly through a quiet town, caught in the gravity of something neither one of them fully understood yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they reached the car, Rio paused with her hand on the passenger door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for today,” she said. “Not just lunch. Everything else too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head. “You mean the devastating emotional unraveling or the moment where you almost believed in fate?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, and it came out a little hoarse. “All of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her for a beat. “You’re not alone in this, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I keep forgetting that,” Rio said, her smile half-apology, half-habit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened the door for her with a slight flourish. “Then I’ll keep reminding you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio climbed in, Agatha rounded to the driver’s side. And maybe it was nothing—just the familiar weight of the day, the comfort of someone finally seeing her. But when Agatha sat behind the wheel, Rio reached out without thinking and touched her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not a grasp. Not a clutch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just fingers brushing fingers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was fleeting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But it meant something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha didn’t say a word as she drove them home.</span>

<p>
<span>By the time they pulled into town, the sky had turned the color of ink-stained parchment. The roads were quiet, the kind of quiet Thistle Grove only ever really achieved in the late afternoon—just before the lights in the shops flickered on, just before the real cold set in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slowed the car near Main Street, letting the hum of the engine settle to a soft purr. She glanced at Rio out of the corner of her eye. Her shoulders were more relaxed now, her expression still turned inward, like she was trying to fit new truths into old scars.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can drop you at the cottage,” Agatha offered gently, “unless there’s something else you need in town?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, turning toward her with a half-smile. “Nah. I think I’ve done enough unraveling for one day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled too, but didn’t answer. She just did a U turn and started toward Rio’s cottage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then something happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something subtle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A hum in the air, like the breath before a spell. Agatha didn’t move, didn’t speak. She only watched, breath caught, as Rio blinked down at her lap—where, nestled between her fingers, a flower had appeared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A single marigold, golden and warm, as if it had been coaxed from the sun itself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at it. “Okay,” she said slowly. “Definitely didn’t mean to do that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched a brow, amused and fascinated. “Not exactly subtle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held it up by the stem, examining it like it might wilt if she breathed too hard. Then, with a little shake of her head and the beginnings of a grin tugging at her lips, she turned to Agatha and offered it to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For you, my lady,” she said with mock-formality, but her voice was soft. Earnest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t take the flower right away. She just looked at her—really looked at her. At the flushed curve of her cheek, at the sparks of magic Rio was still trying to pretend weren’t there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, delicately, she took the flower from her fingers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And here I thought you didn’t flirt,” Agatha murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t,” Rio said, but she didn’t sound very convinced.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tucked the marigold into the pocket of her coat, close to her heart. “Could’ve fooled me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The quiet between them held for a beat longer. Long enough to feel like a choice neither of them was quite ready to make.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Rio reached for the door handle, cheeks still pink. “Thanks for the ride.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anytime.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped out, boots crunching against gravel, and Agatha watched her go. Watched the sway of her coat, the line of her shoulders, the way she glanced back once—just once—before heading toward her cottage, the glow of the porch light waiting for her like a promise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha touched the flower again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t help but smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t go home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned the car toward the north end of town, tires crunching over the thin layer of frost that had settled while they were away. Her hands were tight on the steering wheel, knuckles white, like she could wring the confusion out of her bones if she just gripped hard enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t like her to feel unmoored. But ever since Rio Vidal had walked into her life with that unintentional wildness and those haunted, steady eyes, Agatha had been walking around with the unmistakable sense that something had clicked into place inside her—something ancient and bright and deeply inconvenient.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The lights were already on at Wanda’s place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled into the driveway, killed the engine, and sat in the dark car for a full minute, staring down at the marigold still tucked into her coat pocket. She didn’t even have to touch it. She could feel it. Like it knew something she didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door opened before she could knock.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look like hell,” Wanda said, stepping aside to let her in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha breezed past her. “Good to see you too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda kicked the door shut, trailing her into the cluttered warmth of her living room. Crystals littered every surface. Candles burned low and steady. The house smelled like rosemary and black tea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve got that look,” Wanda said, crossing her arms. “The one that usually means you’re either about to cast something dangerous or run away for six months without telling anyone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t sit. She paced. She ran a hand through her hair. “I don’t know what I’m doing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“About Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s head snapped up. “Did I say anything about Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda smirked. “You didn’t have to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She made her way to the sideboard, poured two glasses of something that looked suspiciously like whiskey, and handed one to Agatha. “Drink. Then talk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a long sip, let the burn chase away the edges of her restlessness. “Something’s happening.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda arched a brow, silent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s like—” Agatha hesitated, the words crawling out of her. “When I’m near her, it’s like my power wakes up. Not just wakes up—it stretches. Purrs. Like it’s been waiting. Like it recognizes her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda didn’t speak, letting her spiral it out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She touched my hand once and a whole garden popped up in the frozen soil under our feet.  And today—today she made a marigold appear out of nowhere. She didn’t even try. It just… happened.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled the flower from her pocket, held it out. It was still warm. Still alive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at Wanda, the silence stretching between them. The weight of what she hadn’t said yet pressed down on her chest like a stone. She wanted to pretend she hadn’t just dropped a bombshell in the form of a glowing flower, but it was impossible. There was too much on the line now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was still holding the marigold, rolling it between her fingers like she was trying to find the hidden truth within its petals.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t just stare at it, Wanda. I’m trying to tell you something,” Agatha said, her voice sharp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda looked up, her expression unreadable. “And I’m listening.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s… it’s not just about her being a Thread,” Agatha said, her heart beating a little faster. “Now she knows she’s one, that this immense power is just simmering inside her.” She paused, sucking in a breath, the words slipping out before she could stop them. “Now that she knows, things are different. She’s going to want to understand it. She’s going to want to explore it. She might not even understand the danger of it yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda sat back, crossing her arms, her gaze steady. “You’re worried about her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw clenched. “I’m worried about us. About what happens when two Threads come together—especially two that are already… this close.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you said this wasn’t about attraction,” Wanda teased, a knowing glint in her eye.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a look, half defensive and half pleading. “It’s not just that. But damn it, Wanda, if she’s a Thread, if she’s connected to the land the way I am… there’s no telling what it could do. Or how it could affect her. Us. She might not even realize how dangerous she could be. How dangerous we could be together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda tilted her head. “And you’re concerned about her safety, or yours?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grimaced. “I don’t know anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda set the flower on the counter, then turned to face Agatha more fully, her expression no longer playful. “You’re more afraid of what happens when all three Threads converge, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t need to answer. Wanda had always been able to read her like a book. The fear that the myth would be true—that the Three Threads would come together in blood, in love, and in magic—and it would wake something they couldn’t control. She didn’t want to admit it, but it was there. A deep, gnawing anxiety that every time she touched Rio, every time they stood close, her magic seemed to hum louder, feel stronger. Rio’s magic, too, was reacting—something primal, alive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what to do with this,” Agatha admitted, her voice tight. “I don’t know what it means for either of us. If she accepts what she is—if she’s fully awakened as a Thread—then we’re both risking something we might not be able to undo.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s eyes softened, but there was no judgment there. Only understanding. “You’re afraid, Agatha. And you’re not the only one who’s been carrying that burden. We all know how it works—the Threads call to each other. They always have. It’s why the Three Sisters were hunted. The land knows, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned away, looking out the window, but the dark trees and snow-dusted streets of Thistle Grove did nothing to calm the turmoil inside her. “It’s not just that. It’s her. Rio. She’s not just a Thread to me. She’s—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Someone you care about?” Wanda interrupted, her voice gentle but firm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, the words getting caught in her throat. “I didn’t think I could care about anyone like this. Not after Nicky. Not after… all of it. But now? Every time I’m near her, it’s like I’m being pulled toward something I can’t see. And every time I touch her… it feels like everything else fades away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a long pause. Agatha waited for the judgment, for the teasing, but Wanda was quiet, listening. She knew the weight of what Agatha was carrying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Wanda finally spoke, her voice was soft, but heavy with truth. “What are you really afraid of, honey? Of how powerful you can be together or that you might be able to love again?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart tightened. It wasn’t a thought she’d let herself fully acknowledge until now. “I’m afraid of losing control. Of dragging her into something she doesn’t even know about, something she won’t be able to outrun once we’re both in it. And I’m scared, Wanda… I’m scared she’s going to want something that could break both of us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda stepped closer, putting a hand on Agatha’s shoulder. Her voice was calm, the way it always was when she wanted Agatha to face the truth. “It’s not always about control, Agatha. Sometimes you have to trust the magic. Trust the threads. Let it pull you where it’s meant to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed. “Then what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda met her gaze, a faint smile curving her lips. “Then it’s something you’re both going to have to figure out together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was just about to say something else—probably something Agatha wouldn’t want to hear—when the front door opened with a soft creak. A gust of late afternoon wind followed, carrying the scent of pine and the faintest trace of woodsmoke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Incoming,” Wanda said with a smile, already turning toward the sound of familiar footsteps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Viz stepped inside, tall and unassuming as always, his shoulders dusted with snow. He set down his bag near the door and shrugged off his coat. “There’s talk of another cold front coming in,” he said, crossing the room. “You should both be bundled up in wool and staying out of trouble.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda rose from her perch on the counter to greet him with a kiss, her fingers brushing his cheek fondly. “You say that like trouble isn’t our love language.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Viz chuckled, then turned to Agatha. He gave her a warm, grounding squeeze to the shoulder—brief but grounding, familiar. “Evening, Aggie. Didn’t mean to interrupt the magic shop talk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not interrupting anything,” Agatha said, voice a little rougher than usual. She was still too in her head, still spinning from the conversation. Her thumb pressed to the smooth edge of the table as if anchoring herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm,” Viz murmured, already heading toward the kitchen. “If you say so.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s phone buzzed in her coat pocket. She fished it out almost absently, but the second she saw the name on the screen, something in her chest pulled taut.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio Vidal</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Thank you for lunch today. And everything else. Really.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>There was a second message, sent just a minute later.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Also—look who decided to pose dramatically just for you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Attached was a photo: Salem sprawled out on what looked like Rio’s sketchbook, front paws tucked under his chin like a feline king, eyes half-lidded in judgment. And nestled right beside him, unmistakably vivid even through the lens, was a flower. A daisy. Bright and impossible, growing from the blank page.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught. The image glowed against her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another buzz.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I didn’t even mean to again. So… that’s not terrifying at all. But also kind of beautiful? I like this magic thing.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the photo, then at the messages, her lips twitching into something small and startled and warm. She didn’t even realize Wanda had moved closer until her friend was peeking over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ohhh,” Wanda breathed. “That’s adorable. You’re so screwed, babe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha elbowed her gently. “Shut up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she didn’t stop smiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another buzz. Agatha glanced down at her phone, already biting back a smile she refused to admit was becoming automatic.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio Vidal</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>P.S. If I conjure another flower and it turns out to be a cactus, I’m blaming you</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a soft, incredulous laugh. Wanda, of course, perked up immediately from across the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” she asked. “What’s so funny?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing,” Agatha said smoothly, pocketing her phone. “Just someone threatening me with botanical vengeance. As one does.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda gave her a knowing smirk, but didn’t push this time. Vision came back into the kitchen, sipping from a mug, and Agatha used that as her cue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should get going,” she said, already rising. “I have a date with my bath, my rabbit, and whatever book Scratchy hasn’t chewed the spine off yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision gave her a warm pat on the shoulder. “Drive safe, Aggie.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda wagged her fingers. “Text your girlfriend goodnight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s not my—” Agatha began, but Wanda had already turned away, humming to herself like she’d won something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, pulling on her coat. Outside, the wind had softened, the stars peeking between slow-drifting clouds. And as she slid into her car, the phone in her pocket felt heavier than it should have. Not burdensome.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just… real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Billy wandered into the apothecary, dragging his bag behind him like it had personally offended him, Agatha had already inventoried everything on the shelves, brewed a fresh batch of nettle tonic, and was elbows-deep in formulating a new restorative serum.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The morning had been quiet, productive. Just how she liked it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well. Almost.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced at her phone again, sitting facedown beside the mortar she was grinding feverfew into. She’d already checked it three times in the last hour, which was pathetic, really. But then, around eight-thirty, it had buzzed.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio Vidal</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Good morning. I think my magic might be broken. Or drunk. I’ve found three flowers so far—one in my coat pocket, one under the toaster (???), and one stuck to the back of my sketchbook. Explain yourself, Thread-witch</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had stared at the message for a full minute before allowing herself a quiet chuckle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, two hours later, the smile kept threatening to rise again every time she remembered the image of Rio pulling a bloom from under her toaster with that wide-eyed, irritated wonder of hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re in a good mood,” Billy said, halfway through a yawn. “Should I be worried?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re always worried when I’m in a good mood,” Agatha replied without looking up. “That says more about you than me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s fair,” he said, dropping his bag onto the floor and collapsing onto the stool at the counter. “What’s the potion of the day?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something gentle. Goldenrod, valerian, a touch of lavender. For tension. Nightmares. General existential dread.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Love that for us,” Billy said. “Very marketable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched a brow. “Dream Drip or Nocturne?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm. Nocturne sounds like a perfume. Dream Drip sounds illegal. Go with that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, despite herself, and made a note in her journal. The moment stretched quietly, broken only by the soft hiss of steam and the faint tinkle of wind chimes from the front window.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Billy said, not looking up from the plant he was now spinning lazily on the counter, “what’s Rio up to?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t react—at least, not outwardly. “Why do you assume I’d know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I saw her name on your phone just now,” he said, casual as anything. “Also, this is Thistle Grove. If three Threads breathe in the same county, the air gets weird.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, keeping her tone neutral. “She’s adjusting. That’s all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy grinned. “Did she draw anything weird yet? I feel like if I had Wild Thread powers, I’d accidentally animate a possum or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She hasn’t mentioned possums,” Agatha said, smirking just slightly. “But there have been… flowers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy’s eyes lit up. “Oooh. Accidental florals. A classic. That means it’s working, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It means something’s waking up,” Agatha murmured, almost to herself. Then, catching Billy’s look: “Which is good. She needs it. She’s been… through a lot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy didn’t press, thankfully. Just shrugged and reached for his notebook. “Well, if she conjures a carnivorous vine or a sentient tomato, I want to see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned back to her potion, stirring once, slowly. “Noted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was alone again by the time she found it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy had headed out with a lopsided grin and a bag of dried elderflower for one of Wanda’s late-night teas, leaving the shop in a lull of quiet sunlight and cooling herbs. The potion was steeping. The ledger was up to date. The air had settled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was clearing the counter when something caught her eye—tucked just behind the register, half-hidden beneath the edge of her journal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A flower.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not one of hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was too wild. Too alive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It looked like something born in a dream: bright violet petals dusted with silver, soft like rain-kissed silk, with a tiny pulse of green at the center—like it still remembered being rooted in soil. It hadn’t been there this morning. She was sure of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t touch it at first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just stared, a twist of something sharp and unnamable fluttering in her chest. It was beautiful. And unmistakably Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With the lightest touch, she lifted it free, brought it to her nose. It smelled like summer at midnight. Like salt and lilac and something ancient beneath it all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, as if summoned—</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bell above the door jingled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Rio said, slightly breathless, a tray with two to-go cups of coffee in one hand and a brown paper bag in the other. “I brought bribery. Coffee. Pastries. A ridiculous croissant that’s trying to collapse in on itself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned slowly, flower still in her fingers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She raised one brow. “Have you been planting things in my shop?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze mid-step. “Oh god. Did you find one?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vivid purple. Silver edges. Smells like secrets.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned. “That’s like the sixth one today. I think my subconscious is staging a floral uprising.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held it out. “Well. It’s a charming uprising. I accept your peace offering.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead of taking it back, Rio smiled and tilted her head. “Actually… that one’s for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused, a flicker of something warm tightening low in her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a theatrical little bow. “For you, my lady.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence that followed wasn’t awkward—it was electric.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha accepted the flower without a word, tucking it behind her ear in one graceful motion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Okay, that’s extremely unfair. You pull that off way too well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You say that like it wasn’t your idea,” Agatha said, lips curving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stood there for a beat too long, that soft hum between them growing louder, fuller, like the air itself was aware of their edges brushing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Rio cleared her throat, lifting the bag. “So. I brought you the almond croissant. Because I’m hoping we can keep talking about the Threads without getting interrupted by mayors or awkward energy from customers asking for herbal remedies for their failing marriages.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, gesturing toward the back. “Come on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They slipped into the reading nook near the back, where the windows let in lazy ribbons of sunlight and the old velvet cushions gave just enough to make it feel like sinking into a secret. Agatha watched as Rio set the coffee cups and the pastry bag down on the low table between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The couch was small. Or maybe it only felt that way now, with Rio beside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They weren’t touching, but gods, they were close. Agatha could feel the heat of Rio’s thigh near hers, the faint brush of her wool coat against Agatha’s sweater whenever one of them shifted even slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached for her coffee, fingers brushing Agatha’s knuckles for the briefest moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Electric. Again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t flinch, but she didn’t lean in either. She just held her breath like the moment might deepen if she stayed perfectly still.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were still curled into the nook, knees pressed close, words slow and quiet like the hush of a forest. Outside, the wind pushed against the windows, the kind of wind that meant rain later. But in here, it was warm. Safe. The scent of coffee and cinnamon hung between them, anchored by the heat of something neither one dared name yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sipped her drink, eyes distant now. She’d been quiet for a while, fingers tapping lightly against the side of the cup. Agatha didn’t rush her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Rio said, “I had a dream. I forgot to tell you. Sunday night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her head slightly, watching her with quiet interest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It wasn’t just a dream, I don’t think” Rio added, voice quieter. “Not like the kind you forget when you wake up. This one… felt like it was stitched into my brain.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t speak, but something in her stillness shifted. She recognized the tone. That tremor of something bigger moving beneath the words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced at her, then away. “She was there. Eliza.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart skipped. “Eliza?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “We were in a forest. She said it was good to see me, that I shouldn’t be afraid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let the silence settle again, inviting, but not pressing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice dropped. “She told me about my mother.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That made Agatha’s gaze sharpen. “Daisy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah.” Rio swallowed. “Said she was lost. Said the magic pulled her under, that she never came back. Something like that, I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt something cold bloom in her chest, something painful and familiar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I always thought she just… didn’t want me,” Rio said. Her voice was steady, but her hands weren’t. “But Eliza said she didn’t leave because she didn’t love me. That it wasn’t up to her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached out before she could think better of it, her fingers brushing against Rio’s wrist, then gently curling around it. Warmth. Steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She didn’t say it outright, but I think—” Rio hesitated. “I think Eliza meant for me to break the cycle. To do what my mother couldn’t. Whatever that was.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a slow breath. “That’s a heavy thing to carry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know if I can,” Rio whispered, eyes on their joined hands. “But I think I want to try.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s thumb moved lightly across her skin, soothing. “You won’t have to do it alone, you know. You’ll always have me and Wanda. We’re in this together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up at her then. “I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that truth sat between them, quiet and sure, blooming like a flower neither of them dared name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let her fingers linger a little longer against Rio’s wrist, then slowly, as if testing a boundary she wasn’t sure she could cross, let her hand slip into Rio’s fully. Not tight, not assuming—just there. Offered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t pull away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she gave a small, almost shy smile. “Sorry. That was a lot. I didn’t mean to just dump all that on you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head. “No. It wasn’t. I’m glad you told me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The quiet settled again, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. It felt like the kind of silence that only came when two people didn’t feel the need to fill space with anything but presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head slightly, her thumb brushing lightly over the back of Rio’s hand. “So… aside from dream visitations and long-lost mother revelations… how’s your day been?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled a soft laugh, her shoulders relaxing a little. “Weird, actually.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lifted her cup in a small toast. “Woke up, found a flower blooming on my pillow. Perfectly intact, petals and all. No stem. Just… there. Like it decided to show up for breakfast.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow, amused. “How very Thread of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, it gets better,” Rio said, grinning now. “One fell out of my hoodie pocket while I was brushing my teeth. And I swear I opened the fridge and a little violet popped out of the butter dish.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed—a rich, unguarded sound—and Rio’s smile deepened like it was reflexive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Agatha said, “either your magic’s attuning more quickly than I expected… or you’ve become the most romantic witch in Thistle Grove.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, their shoulders brushing now. “You say that like it’s a bad thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched at the contact but she didn’t move. “Oh no. I think it’s… kind of beautiful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their hands were still joined. Their knees brushed beneath the table. Agatha could feel the pull of Rio’s presence, not just emotionally, but viscerally—like her magic knew exactly who it wanted to be around.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced down at their hands and then back up, eyes soft. “Is this normal? The way it feels when you’re near someone who—” She paused, cleared her throat. “Who balances you out?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice was lower now. “No. Not normal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But real?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Very.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither moved. Neither looked away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air between them shimmered with something unspoken but undeniable. And though neither reached for more just yet, it felt like they’d already begun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t look away. Her fingers tightened ever so slightly around Agatha’s, and the motion sent a ripple up Agatha’s spine so intense she forgot how to breathe for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were close—so close she could smell the faint citrus of Rio’s shampoo, see the very faint freckles across her cheeks, the way her pupils dilated just slightly when their eyes held.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And gods, Agatha wanted to kiss her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was ridiculous how much she wanted to. She’d been kissed a hundred times, had kissed others with far less hesitation. But this? This wasn’t just a kiss waiting to happen. This was an invocation. A calling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha—who’d sworn off all the things that made her feel too much—had no idea how to survive it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She cleared her throat and forced herself to focus on anything else. “I… think your magic is responding to your emotions,” she said, voice quieter now, gentler. “It’s common when powers first start to settle. Especially with Wild Threads.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t move. Her hand was still in Agatha’s. “So you’re saying I’m just leaking emotion-flower hybrids now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed a breath of laughter, grateful for the shift in tone. “Basically. You should probably warn people before hugging them. Could trigger a full garden.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled but didn’t laugh, and the way she was looking at her now—like she saw right through the cracks Agatha tried so hard to patch—made something ache deep inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think it’s just the magic,” Rio said softly. “I think it’s you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stilled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze dropped to her lips for a heartbeat—just one—and then flicked back up to her eyes. “When I’m near you, it feels like…” She faltered, like the weight of the words might be too much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice was barely audible. “Like what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed. “Like I’m waking up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart clenched. She wanted to lean in. Wanted to close the gap and feel Rio’s mouth on hers—slow and searching and new. But something old and jagged twisted in her chest. Memory. Grief. Guilt. She had no right to feel this way again. Not after everything. Not when her power practically begged to unravel in Rio’s presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So instead of kissing her, she pulled back just slightly. Just enough to break the spell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio noticed. Agatha saw it in the flicker of her eyes, the way she bit her lip and looked down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Rio murmured, starting to withdraw.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stopped her with a gentle squeeze of her hand. “Don’t be. Please. You didn’t do anything wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then why does it feel like I did?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let her thumb brush lightly over Rio’s knuckles. “Because I’m… not used to wanting things I might actually get.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence fell again—but this one was different. Heavier. Shared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moved before Agatha could stop her. She leaned in slowly, her breath a soft whisper against Agatha’s skin. The space between them seemed to stretch and pull, and in that suspended moment, Agatha could almost hear the pounding of her own heart, louder than anything else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their lips brushed, light and tentative at first, as though neither of them could quite believe they were doing this, this thing that had been lingering in the air between them for so long. Agatha felt the warmth of Rio’s breath, the tremble of her hand where it still held Agatha’s, and something inside her broke open—like a dam cracking, ready to drown her in everything she’d spent so many years avoiding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her power reacted, surged, like it recognized the moment—like it knew this was the kind of thing that could unravel everything. Rio’s magic, still so new and unshaped, met hers in that single brush of lips, and it was like fireworks behind her eyes, an electric pulse racing through her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gods, it was so much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, in the middle of it—before Agatha could even savor the taste of Rio’s lips on hers, before she could let herself fall into it completely—the bell over the door jingled, the soft sound slicing through the intimacy of the moment like a cold splash of water.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They froze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a heartbeat, neither of them moved. Agatha’s lips hovered just above Rio’s, the air between them thick with what was left unsaid. Rio was still so close that Agatha could feel the warmth of her skin, the heat of her breath. It was all she could do not to pull her back in, to ignore the interruption and let everything else fade away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But it was impossible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They both broke apart at the same time, their hands falling away from each other with the kind of reluctance that made Agatha’s chest ache. She didn’t look at Rio. Instead, she stood, hurriedly smoothing down her shirt, trying to regain some semblance of composure, some shred of control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cleared her throat. “Guess that’s our cue,” she muttered, her voice thick with the same mix of frustration and longing Agatha felt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could answer, the door opened fully, and in stepped a tall woman in a tailored suit, a clipboard in her hand. Agatha didn’t even have to look to know it was the town’s newest official—she’d been looking for a reason to talk to Agatha about her “unlicensed healing” practices for weeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” the woman said briskly, glancing at both of them. “I need to speak with you about your apothecary’s operating procedures. It’s about your new shipment of—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t hear the rest of the woman’s words, because Rio was already backing away, her face flushed. “I should… go,” she said quickly, not meeting Agatha’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha wasn’t letting her leave that easily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio—” she started, but the woman with the clipboard cleared her throat again, sharply this time, cutting through the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shot her a look, soft but with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “We’ll talk later,” she promised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, she was gone, leaving Agatha to stare after her, her heart still racing and her magic swirling in a wild, unpredictable dance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t even think about it. Before the woman with the clipboard could say another word, Agatha was already moving, her heart thumping hard in her chest as she rushed toward the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excuse me,” she muttered to the woman as she passed, her voice tight with barely-contained tension. She couldn’t let Rio slip away. Not now. Not after everything that had happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door swung open with a soft jingle, and Agatha stepped out into the cool air of Thistle Grove. Rio was already several paces away, her back to Agatha as she made her way down the street, her posture stiff, the space between them suddenly feeling like miles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched as she quickened her pace, almost frantic. This couldn’t be it. Not like this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio!” she called, her voice breaking the quiet street. Rio paused, just for a moment, but it was enough. Agatha was already there, just a few steps away, and before she could second-guess herself, she reached out, her hands finding Rio’s cheeks with a certainty that surprised even her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned slowly, and that’s when Agatha kissed her—without hesitation, without fear. She kissed her with everything she was holding back, everything she had been feeling for days now. It wasn’t gentle, not this time—it was desperate, hungry, a kiss that demanded attention. Agatha held her with both hands on her cheeks, her thumbs brushing the soft skin as she deepened the kiss, her magic flaring, responding to the pull between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they broke apart, they were both breathless, hearts hammering in their chests.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please don’t go,” Agatha whispered, her forehead resting against Rio’s, still holding her face in her hands as though she might lose her if she let go. “Let me just get rid of this nuisance,” she gestured back toward the apothecary, “and then it’s almost time to close anyway. We can go somewhere and talk?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips were still swollen, and her eyes were full of surprise, the same need that Agatha felt mirrored in her gaze. She didn’t speak at first, just stood there, as if trying to process the kiss—then, finally, she nodded, her voice quiet but sincere.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d like that,” she said, her hand finding Agatha’s, fingers curling around hers. “I’d really like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha walked back into the apothecary, feeling lighter, almost giddy, the lingering warmth of the kiss still buzzing through her. She closed the door behind her with a soft click and, without thinking, reached into her pocket to grab her keys—only to stop short.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A couple of roses had found their way into her pocket, their delicate petals soft against her fingers. She chuckled to herself, shaking her head in disbelief, already imagining how Rio must have conjured them, probably without even realizing it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I really don’t know whether to be impressed or a little freaked out,” Agatha muttered, turning the roses over in her hands as she smiled to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, still following her inside, raised an eyebrow at the sound of Agatha’s laugh. “What’s that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes flicked up to meet hers, and she couldn’t help but laugh even more, a quiet, almost delighted sound. “I found these in my pocket,” she said, showing Rio the roses. “Apparently, you’ve been hiding flowers on me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised a hand, an almost shy smile tugging at her lips, and sure enough, a single delicate flower had appeared in her palm as well—a small daisy, its white petals trembling slightly, as though it was alive with magic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, this is getting a little ridiculous,” Rio said, her voice low, but her eyes alight with humor. “I swear I’m not doing this on purpose.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s laughter was soft and warm, and she walked over to Rio, reaching out to gently take the flower from her hand. Their fingers brushed together as she did, the spark of magic between them still palpable, still making her heart race.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No need to apologize,” Agatha said, her voice soft but playful. “It’s actually… kind of perfect.” She pressed the flower gently into Rio’s hand, her fingers lingering on her palm just for a moment longer than necessary.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stood there for a beat, the tension between them palpable, both of them aware of the unspoken things that hung in the air, the pull that neither of them could deny.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Agatha said after a moment, her voice steady despite the way her heart seemed to be beating louder than normal, “I promised I’d get rid of the nuisance. It’s just… a few more minutes, and we’ll be good to go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She offered Rio a smile, one that was warmer now, more genuine. It felt easier, lighter, with Rio standing there, and for the first time, Agatha didn’t feel like she was pretending, or running from something. She felt… open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio returned her smile, her eyes full of something unspoken—something that felt just as right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can wait,” Rio said, her voice soft and teasing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the weight of that simple statement, and her smile widened, before she turned back to deal with the last few details of the apothecary. But the moment was never really gone. It lingered, just beneath the surface, both of them knowing there was something far more between them than they’d yet acknowledged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And for once, Agatha was okay with that.</span>

<p>
<span>Rio settled herself back into the cozy reading nook, trying to focus on the pages of the book she had picked up. But it was useless. Every time she looked down, her mind kept drifting back to the kiss—the way Agatha’s lips had felt against hers, the warmth of her touch, the energy that seemed to pulse between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was like a current, like something inside her had been awakened, and now it was impossible to turn off. Her fingers traced the spine of the book absently as she replayed the moment over and over in her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had been caught completely off guard. There was something in Agatha’s eyes before their lips met, an intensity that mirrored her own. It was as though they both knew what was happening, even if they didn’t fully understand it. It felt… inevitable, in a way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed her eyes, trying to shake off the tingling sensation that had settled in her chest. Her breath still felt shallow, her heart a little unsteady. And yet, despite how much it had taken her by surprise, Rio couldn’t help but want more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>More of that connection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>More of that spark.</span>
</p><p>
<span>More of Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She opened her eyes again, her gaze falling on the small glass of water where Agatha had put the flowers she had conjured earlier. Flowers seemed to appear wherever she went now, as if responding to the pull of something—someone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, maybe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t explain it, but the more time she spent with the woman, the more her magic seemed to hum, like it was responding to her presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And now, after that kiss, she couldn’t help but wonder what else her magic might do when it was tied to Agatha. It wasn’t just her power that had reacted—it was something deeper, something personal. Like the threads that connected them were finally becoming visible, something tangible between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up as the door to the apothecary creaked open. She didn’t need to see who it was to know—it was Agatha. Her heart skipped, and she felt a little breathless again, even though she had been sitting here, waiting for this moment. She hadn’t expected to feel like this, but now it seemed impossible to stop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha appeared in the doorway, her eyes meeting Rio’s immediately, and the world outside seemed to disappear for just a second. Rio stood, smiling, trying to act normal, though her pulse was still racing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ready?” Agatha asked, her voice warm but tinged with something else, something unspoken between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, her hands still tingling from the memory of their kiss. “Yeah. Let’s go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they stepped out of the apothecary and into the cool evening air, Rio felt that same pull between them, as undeniable as before. The tension hadn’t eased, and if anything, it felt even stronger now. She wasn’t sure where this was headed, but one thing was for sure—she wasn’t ready to let go of whatever was beginning to unfold between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They walked together down the quiet street, side by side, and Rio couldn’t help but feel that they were both walking toward something that was already becoming more than either of them had expected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And maybe, just maybe, it was something they both needed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they walked side by side, Rio couldn’t resist the urge anymore. Her fingers reached out and threaded through Agatha’s, gently intertwining their hands. The moment her fingers brushed against Agatha’s, there was a spark—a current that seemed to shoot through her veins and send her pulse racing. Agatha didn’t hesitate. Her fingers tightened around Rio’s, a simple, affectionate squeeze, like she was holding onto something precious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up at her, and there it was again—Agatha’s gaze, warm and open, filled with that unmistakable intensity. It was as though nothing could break through this connection, as though their paths had been aligned long before they’d even met. Agatha didn’t try to hide how she felt anymore. That wall that had been so carefully constructed between them was crumbling, piece by piece, and Rio felt every shift, every crack.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart fluttered in her chest, and her breath caught in her throat. She had never felt anything like this before, this all-encompassing pull, this raw energy that flowed between them effortlessly. It was almost overwhelming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it was just a kiss. Just a kiss, and yet Rio couldn’t even begin to imagine what more would feel like. What would sex be like with Agatha? Her body tensed at the thought, her stomach flipping with the possibility. If this was how it felt with just a kiss—how could she even begin to wrap her mind around the depth of what it would be like to be fully with her? To surrender to this connection, to feel everything tenfold as Agatha’s magic and hers collided in the most intimate way?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her head spun with the thought. What if they were meant to be like this? What if it was always going to be this intense, this undeniable? She could feel Agatha’s power in every touch, in every word, in the way their hands fit together like they were always meant to. And Rio? Her own power was responding in kind. It was like her very soul had been tethered to Agatha’s, and no matter how much she tried to rationalize it, to hold back, it was too late now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The intensity of it was thrilling, but also terrifying. Rio had always been someone who kept her heart guarded, especially after everything with Carol. But with Agatha, everything felt different. She felt seen, understood, in a way she had never allowed herself to feel before. And damn it, it was scaring the hell out of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice broke through Rio’s racing thoughts, grounding her back in the moment. She turned to Agatha, her hand still securely holding hers, and saw the same quiet intensity in her eyes. It made Rio’s heart skip a beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Agatha said, her tone low and playful, “Do you want to grab something to eat, or should we just head back to my place—or your cottage, if you prefer?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio considered the options, the idea of continuing this quiet, intimate walk with Agatha tempting, but at the same time, the thought of retreating to either of their spaces, away from prying eyes, felt even more appealing. She could feel the anticipation of their next steps building, the tension between them thickening with every second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whichever you prefer,” Rio replied, her voice steady, though her heart was beating a little faster than normal. She wanted to say more—maybe joke, or tease—but the weight of the question hung in the air, both of them clearly aware of what was simmering underneath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, a smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. “It’s all the same to me, Rio. But I’m thinking something a little more private, you know? Less… distractions.” She glanced around, like the bustling streets of Thistle Grove were suddenly too loud for them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her breath hitch at the word love, but she managed to keep her composure, nodding slightly. “Maybe we can go to my place?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand squeezed hers tighter. “Alright then, let’s go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they walked toward Rio’s car, Agatha’s steps slowed for a moment, and she glanced at Rio again, her expression softening. “Is this alright? I know it’s fast, but… I just want to be with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio met her gaze, feeling that same pull, the unspoken desire flickering in her chest. “Yeah. It’s perfect,” she said softly, her voice barely above a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The quiet intimacy of the evening was palpable as Rio led Agatha to her car. It was a short drive from the apothecary to the cottage, but somehow the air felt thicker, like the anticipation between them was enough to fill the space of the entire journey.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha climbed into the passenger seat, a slight smile on her lips, and Rio slid into the driver’s seat, her hands briefly resting on the wheel as she glanced over at Agatha. Her heartbeat was still racing from the earlier kiss, and now, knowing they were about to be alone in a place that Rio had never shared with anyone else, it felt like the next step in some unspoken dance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The car hummed to life, and Rio eased out onto the quiet roads of Thistle Grove. The evening was settling in—cool air brushing against the windows, the streets empty, save for the occasional streetlamp flickering overhead. The drive was peaceful, and yet, every inch of silence between them was filled with the electric tension of what was to come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay?” Rio asked, keeping her eyes on the road, though she could feel Agatha’s gaze on her, warm and steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile softened, her eyes flickering briefly to Rio’s hands on the wheel. “I’m more than okay. Just… trying to wrap my head around everything.” Her voice was low, thoughtful, but there was an unmistakable undercurrent of something else, something she didn’t quite know how to express just yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt a surge of emotion. She couldn’t quite place it, but it felt like everything was shifting between them—maybe it was the kiss, maybe it was the way Agatha was looking at her, like she was finally allowing herself to be present in a way she hadn’t before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think we’re both figuring things out,” Rio murmured, trying to focus on the road as they drove through the night. “But… I’m glad we’re doing it together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze never wavered as she turned her head toward Rio, her voice soft but clear. “Me too. It’s… been a long time since I’ve felt something like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s chest tightened, a mixture of warmth and fear curling in her gut. She hadn’t realized how much she was yearning for this connection, but with every passing second, it felt more like a dream that was somehow slipping into reality.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they pulled up to the cottage, the soft glow of the porch light illuminating the front steps, Rio cut the engine. She looked over at Agatha, her heart still beating rapidly. “Here we are,” she said quietly, offering a small, almost shy smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled back, her eyes holding a softness that made Rio’s breath catch. She had no idea what would come next, but she knew she wasn’t afraid anymore. Not of Agatha, not of the feelings that were flooding her, and not of what might lie ahead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Together, they got out of the car and headed toward the cottage, the evening stretching out before them like an unwritten chapter, ready to be filled with whatever they decided to write.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Salem greeted them at the door like he’d been expecting them, weaving between their legs with a triumphant little trill and a tail held high. Rio laughed, her hand brushing lightly against Agatha’s lower back as they stepped inside. The cottage felt warmer somehow, as if it had been holding its breath for this exact moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Welcome to my humble witch hut,” Rio joked, toying with the light switches as she kicked off her shoes and led Agatha inside. “I promise it’s slightly more organized than my brain.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled as her eyes swept across the cozy living room with its mismatched furniture, the books stacked two and three deep on every surface, the half-finished sketches clipped to a corkboard near the windows. “It’s perfect,” she murmured, voice so low it sent something fluttering in Rio’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on,” Rio said, beckoning her toward the kitchen. “You’re getting dinner whether you like it or not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never said I didn’t like it,” Agatha replied smoothly, following close behind, the sound of her heels soft against the wood floor. “I’m just curious what a tortured artist-slash-secret witch eats on a Tuesday night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shot her a look over her shoulder. “You’re making an awful lot of assumptions for someone standing in my kitchen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That earned her a warm, unrepentant grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She handed Agatha a glass of wine and then got to work, pulling out fresh herbs, eggs, spinach, and feta from the fridge. “You like omelets?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like watching you take charge in your own kitchen,” Agatha said with a hint of a smirk, sipping her wine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced at her sideways, lips twitching. “You’re impossible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yet, here I am,” Agatha said, leaning against the counter, watching her move. “Surprised you can cook, though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gasped in mock offense. “I’ll have you know I’m excellent at making breakfast for dinner. You should be honored.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Honored and turned on, apparently,” Agatha murmured, so quietly Rio almost didn’t hear it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked up sharply, her heart skipping. Agatha’s eyes were fixed on her, and there was no teasing now—just hunger, plain and devastating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could make another joke or cut another vegetable, Agatha was closing the space between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kiss hit her like a storm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One moment, Rio was slicing a tomato, and the next, Agatha’s lips were on hers—fierce, needy, like she’d been holding back for too long. Rio dropped the knife without a second thought, her hands flying to Agatha’s waist, pulling her in like a magnet she couldn’t resist. The counter pressed into Rio’s hip as Agatha angled her closer, their bodies flush, breath mingling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kiss deepened fast, too fast, and Rio felt herself burning up under the weight of it, her magic crackling under her skin like a live wire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She barely had the sense to whisper between breaths, “Agatha…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha was already cupping her face, fingers threading into Rio’s hair as if to anchor her there. As if this was the only place either of them belonged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The omelet was forgotten. The wine left untouched on the counter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was only this—this fire, this ache, this incredible pull between them that felt less like desire and more like destiny breaking open right under their feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t remember moving. One second she was gripping Agatha’s waist like a lifeline, and the next she was walking them backward, blindly guiding them out of the kitchen, through the soft-lit living room, mouths barely parting even to breathe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers slipped beneath the hem of Rio’s shirt, just enough to touch skin, and Rio gasped into her mouth, her body sparking like kindling set alight. She wanted to slow down. She wanted to take her time. But the look in Agatha’s eyes—dark, aching, filled with so many years of silence and solitude—made her feel like waiting would be cruel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The backs of Rio’s knees hit the edge of the couch, and she sank down with a breathless laugh, pulling Agatha into her lap. Their mouths met again with even more urgency, as if every second apart had been a mistake they were desperate to undo.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha straddled her, both hands cupping Rio’s face as she kissed her again—slower now, but no less intense. Her thumbs stroked gently along Rio’s cheekbones, like she was memorizing the shape of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gods, you feel like…” Agatha whispered, her forehead pressed against Rio’s. “You feel like something I lost and just found again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands slid under Agatha’s shirt, palms flat against her back, holding her steady. “You make me feel like I can breathe again,” she whispered, eyes searching Agatha’s. “Like I’m finally coming up for air.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kissed her once more, soft and deep, and then rested her head on Rio’s shoulder for a beat, catching her breath. “If this is what one kiss feels like,” she murmured, voice a little shaky, “I might not survive what comes next.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, lips brushing Agatha’s ear. “Then we’ll take our time,” she said. “We’ve got nowhere else to be tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a long, charged silence where they just held each other, bodies pressed close, heartbeats loud in the quiet room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Rio kissed her again, this time with all the patience of someone who intended to worship. But her hands couldn’t bear to be idle, so they set out to investigate every inch of skin they could reach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tugging on Agatha’s sweater, Rio immediately pulled it up and threw it blindly behind her. The sheer expanse of Agatha’s porcelain skin felt almost sacred to her touch, and before she could stop herself, Rio leaned in to kiss every inch of skin on her chest, paying special attention to her pebbled nipples.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha threw her head back with a long moan when Rio finally unhooked her bra and her tongue found her bare skin. Sucking gently on her hard nipple, Rio couldn’t help but let her hand wander, her finger opening her pants button and lowering the zipper almost automatically.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she found Agatha’s core, Rio groaned, feeling her own underwear soaking with how turned on she was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>You’re so wet,” Rio murmured, her voice low and husky, her breath hot against Agatha’s neck. Her hands gripped Agatha’s hips, holding her steady as she shifted beneath her, the friction between them sending a jolt of electricity through both of their bodies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped, her head falling back as she rocked against Rio, her thighs trembling with the intensity of it all. “Rio,” she whispered, her voice trembling, “I’ve never felt like this before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could feel it too—the way their magic seemed to intertwine, like their very souls were reaching out for one another. It was as if the air around them was charged with energy, crackling with a power neither of them could fully comprehend.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But there was no time to think about that now. Agatha was here, straddling her on the couch, her body flush against Rio’s, and the only thing that mattered was the way she felt, the way she moved, the way she moaned softly as Rio’s hands roamed over her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers traced a path up Agatha’s back, marveling at the way her skin shivered beneath her touch. She could feel the heat radiating off of her, the way her body quivered with anticipation. She leaned in, pressing her lips to Agatha’s neck, her tongue darting out to taste her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re incredible,” Rio breathed, her voice barely above a whisper. “Do you have any idea what you’re doing to me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands tangled in Rio’s hair, pulling her closer as she rocked against her once more, the friction between them almost too much to bear. “You’re doing the same to me,” she gasped, her voice shaky. “I’ve never wanted anyone like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart swelled at the words, her chest tightening with the depth of her desire. She had never been this close to anyone before, never felt this kind of connection. And it wasn’t just the physical—though that was overwhelming in its own right. It was the way their magic seemed to meld together, the way she could feel Agatha’s power pulsing through her veins, mingling with her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was intoxicating. And it was driving her wild.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands moved to Agatha’s hips, holding her steady as she shifted beneath her, her lips trailing down Agatha’s neck to the curve of her shoulder. “I need to taste you,” she murmured, her voice thick with desire. “All of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched, her hands tightening in Rio’s hair as she nodded eagerly. “Yes,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “Please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t need to be told twice. Encouraging Agatha to stand up, she slid to the floor and patted the couch so Agatha could sit back down, after she finally managed to slide her jeans down, revealing the wetness that had already soaked through her underwear. Rio’s breath caught in her throat at the sight, her mouth watering as she leaned in, her lips brushing against the soft fabric.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha moaned, her hips bucking against her as Rio’s tongue darted out to taste her through the thin material.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands gripped Agatha’s thighs, holding her steady as she growled against her, her lips finding her clit through the fabric of her underwear. She could feel the way Agatha’s body responded to her touch, the way she trembled with each flick of her tongue, and it only made her more desperate to taste her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hands moved to Agatha’s underwear, slowly sliding them down her legs as she kissed and nipped at the soft skin of her thighs, savoring the way Agatha’s breath hitched with each touch. And then, finally, she was there, her face mere inches from Agatha’s slick folds, the scent of her arousal overwhelming Rio’s senses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re perfect,” Rio breathed, her voice barely above a whisper as she leaned in, her tongue darting out to taste her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s moan was loud and desperate, her hands tightening in Rio’s hair as she arched her back, her hips bucking against her. Rio’s lips wrapped around her clit, her tongue flicking against the sensitive nub as she moaned against her, the vibrations sending a shiver of pleasure through Agatha’s body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh God, Rio,” Agatha gasped, her hips rolling against her as Rio’s tongue worked its magic. “That feels so good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands gripped Agatha’s hips, holding her steady as she devoured her, her tongue lapping at her hungrily, desperate for more. She could feel the way Agatha’s body responded to her touch, the way her thighs trembled with each flick of her tongue, and it only made her more desperate to bring her over the edge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her tongue pressed against Agatha’s entrance, teasing her as she felt the way Agatha’s body clenched around her, her breath coming in short, desperate gasps. Rio moaned against her, the sound vibrating through her as she pressed inside, her tongue exploring her as Agatha’s moans filled the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha gasped, her hands tightening in her hair as she rocked against her, her body trembling with the intensity of her pleasure. “I’m so close.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips wrapped around her clit once more, her tongue flicking against it as her hands moved to grip Agatha’s hips, holding her steady as she brought her over the edge. Agatha’s body convulsed, her moans loud and desperate as she came, her magic surging through her in a wave of pure ecstasy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could feel it too—the way their magic connected, the way it seemed to explode around them in a burst of light and power. The lights in the cottage flickered as the air around them crackled with energy, the force of it almost too much to bear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, everything was still. The only sound in the room was the sound of their labored breathing, the air thick with the scent of their desire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s body slumped against Rio’s, her chest heaving as she tried to catch her breath. “That was…” she trailed off, her voice shaky. “I’ve never felt anything like that before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands moved to cup Agatha’s face, her thumbs brushing against her cheeks as she leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to her lips. “Neither have I,” she murmured, her voice thick with emotion. “You’re incredible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips curved into a smile, her eyes fluttering closed as she leaned into Rio’s touch. “I want to make you feel that too,” she whispered, her voice barely audible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart swelled at the words, her chest tightening with the depth of her desire. She hadn’t expected this—hadn’t expected to feel this kind of connection with anyone. But now that she had…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please,” Rio breathed, her voice barely above a whisper. “I need you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands moved to the hem of Rio’s shirt, pulling it over her head before her fingers fumbled with the button of her pants, sliding them down her legs with a sense of urgency that made Rio’s heart race. And then, finally, they were skin to skin, their bodies pressed together in a way that felt almost too much to bear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips found Rio’s, her tongue darting into her mouth as her hands roamed over her body, exploring every inch of her with a sense of wonder that made Rio’s chest tighten. She had never felt so desired before, so wanted, and it was almost overwhelming in its intensity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips trailed down Rio’s neck, her teeth nipping at the soft skin as her hands moved to cup her breasts, her thumbs brushing against her nipples as she moaned against her. “You’re so beautiful,” Agatha breathed, her voice thick with desire. “I’ve never wanted anyone like this before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath hitched, her hands tangling in Agatha’s hair as she shifted beneath her, her hips bucking against her as Agatha’s hand slid between her legs, her fingers pressing against her entrance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio gasped, her voice trembling with anticipation. “Please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers pressed inside her, her movements slow and deliberate as she watched Rio’s face, her eyes dark with desire. She could feel the way Rio’s body responded to her touch, the way she clenched around her, and it only made her more desperate to bring her over the edge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers curled inside her, pressing against her g-spot as her thumb brushed against her clit, the sensation almost too much to bear. Rio’s moans filled the room, her hands gripping the couch cushions as her body trembled with the intensity of her pleasure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio gasped, her voice shaky. “I’m so close.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips found hers, her tongue darting into her mouth as her fingers moved faster, her thumb pressing against her clit with a sense of urgency that made Rio’s body convulse. And then, finally, she was coming, her magic surging through her in a wave of pure ecstasy, the force of it almost too much to bear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air around them crackled with energy again, the power in the cottage surging before it cut out completely, the room plunged into darkness as the force of their connection overwhelmed them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, everything was still. The only sound in the room was the sound of their labored breathing, the air thick with the scent of their desire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha whispered, her voice barely audible. “That was…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Amazing,” Rio murmured, her voice thick with emotion. “You’re amazing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The cottage was bathed in silence, save for their breathing—shaky and uneven and slow to settle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The power had blown the moment Rio came, a sudden flash of magic bursting outward like a spark igniting dry kindling. Every light in the house had flared once and then gone out in a gasp, as though the cottage itself couldn’t handle the intensity of them. Now, in the aftermath, the world felt thick with warmth and wonder and disbelief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lay curled against Rio’s chest, their limbs a tangle beneath the rumpled throw blanket that had somehow managed to survive the chaos. Her cheek rested over Rio’s heart, her breath a soft rhythm against damp skin. The air was warm and close, fragrant with sweat and magic and whatever wild bloom Rio had conjured in the moment they lost control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a soft, incredulous laugh, brushing her fingers through Agatha’s tousled hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We really knocked the power out,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed. “Mmhm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not even going to pretend to be shocked?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>am</span>
</em>
<span> shocked,” Agatha said, lifting her head just enough to look down at her. “Shocked, delighted, and mildly terrified. That’s the trifecta.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, brushing her fingers along Agatha’s spine. “We’re a menace together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a low chuckle, sinking down again and nuzzling her nose into the curve of Rio’s neck. “Speak for yourself. I’m just a humble apothecary with very little upper body strength. You, on the other hand—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t even,” Rio warned, already grinning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha was grinning too. “I’m just saying. Maybe next time we take some precautions. Like backup generators. Or enchanted fuses.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tipped her head back against the couch cushion and closed her eyes, basking in the warmth of Agatha’s weight against her, the flickering buzz of her own barely-contained power still dancing under her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know,” Agatha murmured after a moment, her voice quieter now, more thoughtful, “If this is what happens when we have sex… I’m genuinely scared for what we’ll do if we ever get into a proper fight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, turning her head to kiss the top of Agatha’s head. “We’d probably level the town.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stayed like that for a long time, quiet and content, limbs still tangled, hearts still racing from a kiss that had turned into a storm. The house remained dark, but neither of them reached for a candle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The glow between them was enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled softly, brushing a bit of Agatha’s hair from her face. “I think we probably broke the power grid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed in response, her head resting on Rio’s chest, fingers drawing lazy, barely-there shapes across her stomach. “That or the universe just needed a moment to recover.” Agatha placed an affectionate kiss on Rio's sternum. “You can always fix it, you know? Just close your eyes and focus on turning the lights back on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?” Rio looked at her surprised, but Agatha just nodded, resting her head on her chest again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio followed her instructions and took a deep breath, picturing the cottage illuminated again. When she opened her eyes, she gasped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Holy shit,” she laughed incredulously, and Agatha chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See, you’re a natural.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They both laughed quietly, tangled up in limbs and warmth, the flickering glow of the newly reawakened lights giving everything a honeyed hue. It felt unreal—too good, too intense, like some secret spell neither of them had meant to cast but couldn’t undo.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head slightly, noticing the distinct absence of furry judgment. “Huh,” she murmured. “Salem’s MIA.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted her head, blinking like she’d forgotten the cat even existed. “Oh gods. He saw what was coming and noped right out of here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, really laughed this time, the kind that made her ribs ache. “Scarred for life. He probably found some shadowy corner of the attic to bury the memory.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Poor thing,” Agatha grinned. “Do you think he’ll ever look me in the eye again?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Absolutely not,” Rio said, biting her lip to stifle a smirk. “He’ll flinch every time you touch a throw pillow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes sparkled with mischief. “Maybe we should get him a little therapy mouse. One of those felt ones. For emotional support.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, shifting slightly so she could look Agatha more directly. “You’re ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha murmured, leaning in again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She kissed her—slow, lingering, a little softer than before. The kind of kiss that promised they weren’t done exploring whatever this was. That they didn’t want to be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>They finally untangled themselves from the couch, reluctant but hungry, and Rio tugged on one of Agatha’s hands to help her up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stretched with a soft, luxurious groan, limbs slow and heavy. “Gods, I forgot what it felt like to be completely unraveled.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked and swatted her hip gently with a kitchen towel. “You’ll have to hold it together for another hour. I’m finally feeding you, remember?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved around the kitchen with practiced ease, barefoot and flushed, pulling out a carton of eggs, some cherry tomatoes, garlic, a bunch of kale, and a block of feta cheese from the fridge. Agatha watched her in fascination, leaning against the counter with her chin resting in her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re full of surprises,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tossed her a look over her shoulder. “Because I can cook?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because you’re good at it,” Agatha said, her smile lopsided. “And because I keep discovering all these pieces of you I didn’t expect to love so much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze for a fraction of a second—just long enough for Agatha to catch it—then kept moving. The sizzle of garlic hitting the pan filled the silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They settled at the tiny kitchen table ten minutes later, plates warm, the smell of food mingling with the quiet hum of the fridge and the storm still brewing between them, softer now but no less present.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was terrified,” Agatha said finally, picking at her food before looking up. “Of this. Of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, setting her fork down gently. “Me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, curls falling into her eyes. “It wasn’t just the magic, although… gods, Rio, whatever we are together—it’s wild. It’s unpredictable, powerful. And that shouldn’t scare me this much, but it does.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio waited, the quiet between them filled with weight but no pressure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And it wasn’t just that,” Agatha continued, her voice low, threading careful words between deeper truths. “After Nicky, after everything fell apart—I didn’t just walk away from magic. I walked away from feeling anything at all. I buried it so deep I forgot what it felt like to… want. To hope.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached for her hand across the table, lacing their fingers together with a gentleness that almost undid Agatha entirely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I get it,” Rio said, her voice barely above a whisper. “You don’t owe me any explanations, Agatha. But I want you. All of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard, blinking back the prick of something behind her eyes. “I don’t know what we’re doing. But I know I don’t want to run from it anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio squeezed her hand and offered a small, quiet smile. “Then we don’t run.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat there in silence, fingers entwined, the plate between them forgotten. The candle on the table flickered in the draft, casting shadows across the walls—and maybe, finally, the light was starting to reach the corners they’d both kept locked away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course Agatha spent the night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They barely made it to the bedroom before the next round began, kisses urgent and reverent, like each one was both a prayer and a dare. Clothes were discarded along the hallway, the soft glow of Rio’s magic casting dappled light against the walls, blooming where their skin brushed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was slower this time. No less intense, but layered with tenderness, with curiosity, with awe. They took their time—tracing, tasting, learning each other in ways no one else ever had. Agatha’s lips found the hollow of Rio’s throat, her name breathed like a vow. Rio’s hands mapped the planes of Agatha’s body with reverence, every sigh and shiver committed to memory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They went at it for hours—soft laughter between gasps, whispered confessions tangled between sheets. The storm of their magic built with each crest, humming through the air until it felt like the very walls were pulsing with it. And when they both came again, clinging to each other like they were trying to hold the universe together—the power blew out completely, sparks flickering like fireflies across the ceiling before everything went still.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither of them cared. They fell asleep tangled together, skin warm, limbs intertwined beneath the covers. Salem, wisely, did not return.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lay there in the dark, her hand resting just above Agatha’s heart, feeling the steady thrum of it beneath her palm. She had never felt anything like this. Never known what it meant to be this full of something—of power, of purpose, of someone else’s breath so perfectly in sync with her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t know what was ahead. But in that moment, she knew this: she had never felt more alive. Never felt more like herself. And she was not letting go.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha stirred slowly, the warm weight of Rio’s arm draped across her waist anchoring her to the bed. For a moment, she let herself stay still, breathing in the soft scent of lavender and something uniquely Rio—like ink and earth and starlight. Morning light filtered in through the curtains, casting a golden haze over the room, and everything felt too perfect to disturb.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the clock on Rio’s nightstand was not a liar, and unfortunately, Agatha had a shop to open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sound stirred Rio, who nuzzled against her back with a sleepy hum. “What time is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Too early,” Agatha murmured, even though she was already mentally calculating how fast she could get ready and still make it back to the shop on time. “I should go open the apothecary.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tightened her hold, her voice thick with sleep. “Five more minutes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t resist. She turned in Rio’s arms until they were face to face, noses nearly touching, and let her fingers trace a lazy path along Rio’s bare shoulder. “You’re dangerous, you know that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, eyes still closed. “Takes one to know one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stayed like that for a few blissful minutes, tangled up in warmth and each other, exchanging soft kisses and quieter smiles. Agatha didn’t want to move. She didn’t want to think about the outside world, or customers, or inventory. She wanted to stay right here, wrapped up in the calm after the storm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But reality eventually beckoned, and Agatha groaned as she finally sat up. “I really do have to go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>To her surprise, Rio sat up too, already reaching for the robe draped across the foot of the bed. “Then I’ll make you breakfast. And give you a ride, if you want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked at her. “You don’t have to—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to,” Rio said simply, tying the robe around her waist and standing up, completely unbothered by her own disheveled state. “Besides, Salem probably needs a break from all the magic. He’ll thank me later.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled as she gathered her clothes from the floor, casting a glance over her shoulder. “I’m not sure I need a break.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused in the doorway to the kitchen, and that smile she gave Agatha—it nearly knocked the wind from her lungs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then stay close,” Rio said. “I’m just getting started. Towels are in the cabinet under the sink in the bathroom, if you want a shower.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her disappear down the hallway, the faint padding of her bare feet a quiet echo in the stillness of the cottage. A strange ache bloomed in her chest—one she hadn’t felt in years. Not since before Nicky. Not since the world cracked open beneath her feet and left her standing in the wreckage of everything she thought she understood about life, magic, and love.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet… here she was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled her shirt over her head and sat on the edge of the bed for a long moment, grounding herself with a deep breath before standing. The air still carried the scent of the night before—Rio’s perfume tangled with dried herbs and the faint copper tang of magic burned into the atmosphere. It was heady. Familiar. Too good to be real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But it was real. Rio was real. And the way her magic had surged in sync with Agatha’s—it hadn’t been a coincidence. It was a thread-deep resonance that shook Agatha to her core.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, she padded to the bathroom across the hallway and took a quick shower, and then pulled on her clothes from the night before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the kitchen, she found Rio at the stove, humming something under her breath while scrambling eggs in a skillet. Two plates were already laid out on the counter, along with toast and sliced fruit. Salem was nowhere to be seen, clearly still hiding from the energetic disaster of the night before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You really can cook,” Agatha teased, slipping up behind her to wrap her arms around Rio’s waist. “Color me impressed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back into her with a grin. “I contain multitudes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rested her chin on her shoulder. “Shame about your magic shorting the power last night. Salem may never recover.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, he’s probably hiding somewhere, filing a trauma report with the spirit realm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They both laughed, the kind that warmed from the inside out. Agatha kissed Rio’s shoulder, soft and lingering, and closed her eyes. For a moment, it was just them—no past, no loss, no powers threatening to burst at the seams. Just this quiet domesticity she never thought she’d have again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They ate breakfast at the kitchen table, legs brushing, their conversation looping between teasing and tenderness. And when it was time to leave, Rio didn’t hesitate—she grabbed her keys, pulled on a jacket, and walked Agatha to the car as if it was the most natural thing in the world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On the drive into town, Agatha caught herself looking over at Rio more than once, studying her profile, the curve of her smile, the way sunlight hit her hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she realized—terrifying and exhilarating all at once—she was already falling. Maybe had been for a while now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Rio pulled up in front of the apothecary and parked, Agatha had to take a breath before she could speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I meant it,” she said, fingers lingering over the handle of the car door. “About being scared. But I’m not running anymore. Not from this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, quiet and sure. “Good. Because I’m not letting go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned across the console and kissed her—just once, but it was full of promise and clarity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she was stepping out into the morning, unlocking her door, feeling—for the first time in too long—like she might finally be whole again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda strolled into the apothecary like she owned the place a few hours later, her red scarf trailing behind her and Billy close on her heels, nose deep in his phone. Agatha was labeling tincture bottles behind the counter, but the moment Wanda’s eyes landed on her, they narrowed with amused suspicion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, well, well,” Wanda said, coming to a stop in front of her. “Would you look at you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t even glance up. “Don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy looked up from his phone, clueless. “What’s going on?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda leaned against the counter like a gossiping teenager. “Your godmother is positively </span>
<em>
<span>glowing</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. “Please don’t traumatize the child.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m seventeen,” Billy muttered, though he was already frowning, clearly sensing something was afoot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She got laid,” Wanda said in a stage whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy groaned. “Oh my god, I did </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> need to know that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told you,” Agatha muttered, cheeks flushed as she shot Wanda a glare. “You’re the worst.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda looked thoroughly delighted. “No, honey. I’m the best. Because I’ve been rooting for this since the minute Rio showed up in town.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha set the last bottle down, her movements a little too precise, a little too focused. “It’s not what you think.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Oh?</span>
</em>
<span>” Wanda folded her arms, tilting her head. “Because what I think is that you spent the night with her and now you’re walking around like someone untied all the knots in your soul. That what you think I think?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled sharply, but didn’t argue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy made a strangled noise. “I’m going to go check the back now. Forever. Goodbye.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He disappeared behind the shelves, muttering about trauma and salt circles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda waited patiently, and after a long moment, Agatha gave in and leaned against the counter, her expression shifting from playful annoyance to something quieter, more vulnerable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It wasn’t just sex,” she said, softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s teasing faded instantly. “I didn’t think it was.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice dropped lower, almost reverent. “I stayed the night. We made dinner. We laughed. We talked like we couldn’t get enough of each other. And when we touched—Wanda, it wasn’t just intense. It was like… our magic knew. Like it had always known.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s eyes softened. “You let her in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “She’s seen things I haven’t let anyone see in years. And the way she looks at me, like she’s not scared of what’s in me, like she wants all of it… I don’t know what to do with that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You hold on to it,” Wanda said. “You stop running from it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head slowly. “You should’ve seen her, Wanda. The things we can do together—it’s unreal. The power, it’s almost too much. We blew the power out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seriously?” Wanda’s grin returned. “How many orgasms did that take?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but laughed despite herself. “Just a couple. We’re a menace. Then she fixed it, only for us to break the damn thing again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda beamed. “I’m so proud.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t be.” Agatha ran a hand through her hair, still half-stunned. “It terrifies me. I spent so long shutting myself off, pretending none of it mattered, and now she’s just… unraveling me like it’s the easiest thing in the world.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because it is,” Wanda said gently. “When it’s right, it should be this easy. You don’t have to fight it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed. “I didn’t know it could feel like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Wanda said, placing a hand on hers, “now you do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t speak, but she didn’t pull away either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then her phone buzzed, lighting up with a new message. She glanced at the screen, and her lips softened into a smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Wanda asked, leaning in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held up her phone. It was a text from Rio:</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio Vidal</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Hey gorgeous. Thanks again for everything. I’m still kind of floating.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>P.S. This one just popped up in the bathroom. I’m not even mad. It’s beautiful.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>[Attached: a blurry photo of a flower blooming on the windowsill]</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, eyes shining. “She’s conjuring flowers again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda raised a brow. “Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a glare but couldn’t stop smiling as she typed back:</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>If conjuring flowers is a side effect, I say we don’t stop.</span>
</em>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>I’ll see you tonight?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda reached for her chest dramatically. “Gods, you’re so cute when you’re in love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> in love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda just smirked and said, “Sure, honey. Keep telling yourself that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t stop smiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not the big, flashy kind of smile, but the soft, impossible-to-hide kind—the one that bloomed without warning and lingered in the corners of her mouth like a secret kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The apothecary was quiet. Warm light filtered through the front windows, catching on the edges of glass bottles and suspended herbs, casting lazy shadows that danced across the walls. The scent of lavender and sweet myrrh hung in the air, comforting and familiar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had been a good morning. No—a perfect one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could still feel Rio’s fingertips on her skin. Still remember the way she’d looked bathed in early light, hair mussed, one arm lazily flung across Agatha’s waist like she belonged there. Which, terrifyingly, beautifully, she just might.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And gods, the way their magic had reacted to each other. Like it had been waiting. Like it had been aching for centuries to find its match. It still hummed in her even now, a soft thrum beneath her skin. Not dangerous. Not volatile. But alive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned against the counter and flipped through the handwritten ledger absently, trying not to replay every moment from the night before like some moon-eyed teenager. A faint blush rose to her cheeks anyway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bell over the door gave a sudden jingle—too sharp, too loud in the stillness. Agatha jumped slightly, straightening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No one was there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She frowned, stepping around the counter. The door was closed, latched, no breeze to speak of. But a rose—fresh, deep red—now lay on the floor just a few feet inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her stomach tightened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha knelt slowly, fingers brushing the silky petals. A whisper of magic tingled up her arm—not Rio’s. Not hers either. Different. Faint. But… old.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door jangled again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time, it opened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A woman stepped inside, tall and elegant in a dark wool coat that fit her like it had been tailored to her bones. She moved like she didn’t so much walk as glide, and her smile was perfectly practiced—neutral, pleasant, forgettable if not for the sharpness in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good afternoon,” the woman said, voice smooth as velvet. “Apologies for the abrupt entrance—this place wasn’t easy to find.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha straightened, tucking the rose into her pocket before the woman could get a good look. “We like it that way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman offered a smile. “Understandable. You must be Agatha Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you are?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Mara Greaves,” she replied, producing a card and setting it on the counter. “I’m a folklore researcher from Saint Cyprian University. I’m working on a book about regional magical myths, and Thistle Grove has come up again and again—particularly this persistent legend about the Threads?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha picked up the card. Ivory paper, embossed lettering. Dr. Mara Greaves, Department of Occult and Folklore Studies. No website. No contact info. Just a discreet symbol in the corner—barely noticeable, unless you knew what to look for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A circle, divided into three sections. A trinity. A wheel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kept her face carefully blank. “Most of the stories around here are just that. Stories.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I know,” Mara said, stepping further in, eyes drifting over the shelves. “But I find it fascinating how consistently the myth appears across different sources. Three women. Three powers. One line broken and restored.” She smiled, a little too pleased with herself. “It’s quite poetic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head. “Folklore usually is. Romanticized tragedy is a crowd favorite.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course.” Mara turned, gaze landing on her again. “Still, it’s rare for a town to preserve its myths so intimately. The Threads weren’t just fairy tales, were they? People here remember them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“People here remember a lot of things,” Agatha replied coolly. “Doesn’t make them real.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Mara agreed. “But sometimes the stories are just cleverly disguised truths. That’s what I’m interested in. The patterns beneath the surface.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “You said you just got into town?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This morning. I’ll be staying at The Larkspur Inn while I conduct interviews and poke around the library and public records.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You won’t find much in there. This town doesn’t write down what it doesn’t want outsiders to see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mara’s smile only widened. “I was hoping you might help with that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a dry chuckle. “You were hoping wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well.” Mara slid her hands into the pockets of her coat, her expression never wavering. “Thank you for your time. I’m sure we’ll see each other again. Small towns have a way of looping in on themselves.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, she turned and left, the door closing behind her with a final-sounding click.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t move for a long moment. The rose in her pocket suddenly felt heavier. Warmer. She took it out and threw it in a basin, setting it on fire until there was nothing but ashes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she flipped the card over—and her stomach clenched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was no ink on the back. No embossed signature. But pressed into the cardstock like a seal was a sigil she hadn’t seen in over two decades.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eliza’s warning rose like a whisper from the grave:</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>If you ever see that mark again, run. Or burn it. But do not, under any circumstances, let it stay close.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crushed the card in her hand, her heart pounding now, not with excitement, not with the lingering rush of Rio’s magic—but with dread.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned toward the back room, already reaching for her phone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Time to call Wanda.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha locked the apothecary with quick, practiced movements, the crushed card still clutched tightly in her hand. She slipped it into her coat pocket, fingers trembling just slightly as she brought out her phone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She scrolled past a few missed messages from supply vendors and one from Billy—something about his essay on “plants that could kill but probably won’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then there was her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hesitated for a second, then typed quickly.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Hey, something came up. I need to meet Wanda… little magical situation I want to get ahead of. I’ll explain when I see you. </span>
</em>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>If you’re free, you can come meet us. I’d like that. If not, I’ll be a little late. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t wait for the reply. She already knew Rio would either show up with that determined look in her eyes or text back in concern laced with sarcasm. Either way, Agatha felt lighter for telling her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still holding her phone, she dialed Wanda. The call picked up before the second ring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please tell me this is about those strawberry scones you promised me and not something grim,” Wanda said without preamble.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Strawberry scones might be less of a threat,” Agatha muttered, glancing around the street as she walked. “You remember that seal Eliza warned us about years ago? The tri-sigil?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was quiet for a second. Then: “You saw it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pressed into a card. Woman came into the shop. Claimed to be a folklore researcher—Dr. Mara Greaves. Saint Cyprian University, apparently.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda hissed through her teeth. “That sounds like bullshit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha said, voice tight. “I need to talk. Somewhere quiet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Meet me at the overlook. Ten minutes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Done.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hung up, shoving the phone into her coat pocket. The wind had picked up, sharp and sudden, curling around her ankles like a warning. But she squared her shoulders and kept walking, faster now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The overlook sat on a low hill just outside the heart of Thistle Grove, where the land dipped into forest beyond. They used to come here as teenagers, just the two of them, drinking pilfered wine and talking magic under the stars. It felt right, coming back here for this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was almost there when her phone buzzed again.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio </b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Of course I’ll come. Just tell me where. You okay? Should I bring snacks or backup?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile broke through her tension.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Meet us at the overlook. Know where that is? And always bring snacks AND backup. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The overlook hadn’t changed in twenty years—still windswept and wild, the iron arch rusted at the edges, moss curling over the stones like nature’s quiet protection spell. Agatha stood with her arms crossed, the wind tugging at her coat as Wanda approached from the path, her scarf blazing red against the gray horizon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” Wanda said as she neared. “What happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t speak at first. She stared out at the tree line, fingers curling tighter into the sleeves of her coat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A woman came into the shop this morning. Said she was researching local folklore,” she said finally. “Said she’d read about the Threads and wanted to know more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda frowned. “That’s not too weird. People ask about the Threads all the time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Before she showed up, a rose appeared on the counter. Not Rio’s. The magic signature was off. Heavy. I burned it the second she left the shop.” Agatha said, turning to face her. “And then there was the Tri-Sigil. She had a calling card with it pressed on the back. Exact engraving. Not a modern interpretation. The original.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s brow furrowed, tension knotting between her shoulders. “That’s not good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know.” Agatha took a slow breath, rubbing the bridge of her nose. “And I didn’t feel a hint of magic on her. She was too normal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s mouth twisted. “That’s never a good sign.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before either of them could say more, the wind shifted and the soft crunch of gravel sounded behind them. Agatha turned to find Rio walking toward them, cheeks flushed, curls wild around her face. She looked like a woman who had run the last part of the path, concern etched in every line of her beautiful face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There you are,” Rio said, breathless but smiling. “I didn’t mean to intrude, but you said I could come find you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved without thinking, closing the distance to pull her in. “You’re not intruding. I’m glad you came.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pressed a kiss to her cheek. “You sounded off. What’s going on?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda cleared her throat. “That’s my cue to let you two talk. I’ll give you a minute.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha stopped her with a glance. “No. Stay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked between them, brows knitting together. “Okay. You’re worrying me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gently took Rio’s hand, anchoring herself with the contact. “Earlier this afternoon, someone came into the shop asking about the Threads. Claimed to be a folklore scholar. Which happens. But…” She hesitated, watching Rio’s face. “She knew things she shouldn’t. Symbols she shouldn’t have access to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio went still. “You think she’s dangerous?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think she might be connected to something dangerous,” Agatha said carefully. “And I didn’t want to bring this up so soon—especially after last night—but… you deserve to know something is shifting in town. And I need you to be careful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded slowly. “Okay. I trust you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something inside Agatha softened. She hadn’t realized how much she needed to hear those words. “I’ll explain everything. Just not here. Not now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda stepped forward again. “We’ll figure out who she is. But Agatha’s right—this woman isn’t just writing a research paper.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her, then at Wanda, then back. “Alright. Then tell me how I can help.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand tightened around hers. “You already are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And when Rio smiled—bright, fierce, unshaken—it lit something in Agatha that no threat could dim.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt Rio’s fingers twitch gently in hers, a subtle shift that said her brain was already working a mile a minute. Then Rio looked between her and Wanda with a gleam in her eye—half challenge, half promise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” she said, tilting her head, “if we’re looking into secret societies and creepy folklore researchers, I might be able to pull in a little help.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda raised an eyebrow. “Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “My best friend, Alice Wu. She’s a PhD in computer science, an insufferable know-it-all, and a terrifyingly good hacker. She once got into the Pentagon’s digital archives just to prove a point.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “She what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was a very specific point,” Rio added with a smirk. “But the takeaway is—if this folklore researcher left even the tiniest digital trace behind, Alice will find it. And she’ll do it with a smoothie in one hand and a cat in her lap.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda gave an approving hum. “We like her already.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled despite herself. The tension that had been squeezing her chest since Mara Greaves had shown up at the apothecary loosened a fraction. Trusting Rio was starting to feel as instinctive as breathing—and now, the possibility of real help, real allies, felt less like grasping at moonlight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squeezed Rio’s hand, brushing her thumb over the back of her knuckles. “Just… promise you’ll be careful. If these are Watchers—if she’s one of them—then poking the hive too hard might get us all stung.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile was soft but unyielding. “I promise. But I didn’t come all this way to sit on the sidelines while you deal with shadowy creeps alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda looked between them, and for once, didn’t say a word. She just smiled—a little crooked, a little sad—and turned her face to the breeze as if listening for something on the wind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had a feeling the winds were shifting indeed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio said, shifting her weight. “Maybe we should move this little council to the cottage. I can throw dinner together while we talk, and it’ll give me a chance to call Alice—get her eyes on this without the magical bits.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda arched a brow. “You mean the witch-free version of this conspiracy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” Rio replied. “Alice is a digital bloodhound. If there’s anything to find about our mysterious friend or her ‘research,’ she’ll find it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a faint smile, the kind that said thank you without needing the words. The idea of being in Rio’s space again, especially after the night they’d shared, felt like the safest place she could be. She needed that safety now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good idea,” Agatha said. “Let me just grab my bag.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda didn’t move. “You think I’m not coming?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “I figured you had—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda scoffed, cutting her off with a smirk. “If someone’s sniffing around about the Threads, I’m not sitting this one out. I’ll even bring wine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Then it’s a party.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her friend a dry look. “A secret meeting disguised as a dinner party, more like.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Same difference,” Wanda said, already heading toward the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lingered just long enough to catch Rio’s eye again. There was something quiet and reassuring in the look she gave her, like a thread pulling her gently toward steadier ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was happening again—this constant pull between them, electric and soft all at once. But there wasn’t time to dwell. Not yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a little sigh and the familiar flutter in her chest, Agatha turned and followed them out, already bracing herself for whatever the night would bring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time the sky began to deepen into twilight, Agatha had retrieved an overnight bag from her house, and Wanda had swung by her place for a bottle of wine and a tray of something decadent and chocolatey she swore she didn’t buy for this occasion—though no one believed her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The lights inside the cottage spilled golden and soft through the windows, welcoming them like something sacred. Rio had left the door unlocked, and the moment Agatha stepped inside, she was wrapped in the smell of garlic, herbs, and roasted vegetables. It grounded her in the best way, like a tether pulling her out of her racing thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shoes off at the door,” Rio called from the kitchen, not looking up from the skillet she was tending. “House rules.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda snorted but obeyed. “You’re so domestic. It’s disturbing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shot her a dry look over her shoulder. “Don’t ruin the illusion.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dropped her bag by the door and peeled off her boots, her gaze lingering on Rio’s back—barefoot, sleeves rolled up, the hem of her worn tee rising just slightly when she moved. It was the kind of intimacy she hadn’t let herself want for so long, and now that she had it, it hummed through her chest like a second heartbeat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t say anything. She just walked up behind Rio and gently brushed her fingers along her lower back in greeting. The way Rio’s body leaned into the touch—subtle but certain—sent a thrill straight through her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I grabbed some wine,” Wanda announced, swinging the bottle in one hand and balancing the dessert box in the other. “And brownies. Possibly infused with something mildly illegal, but I’ll neither confirm nor deny.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed and turned off the burner. “Sounds like you’re fitting right in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Within minutes, the three of them had settled around the small dining table. Rio had made a warm orzo salad with roasted vegetables and lemon-herb chicken. Everything tasted too good for the kind of tension still simmering just beneath the surface of their conversation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a few bites, Rio wiped her fingers on a dish towel and picked up her phone. “Okay, I’m gonna call Alice. Just a heads-up—she doesn’t know anything about the Threads or the magic. Let’s keep the weird to a minimum.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Define ‘minimum,’” Wanda muttered, but nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned in, close enough that Rio’s thigh brushed hers under the table. “You trust her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“With my life,” Rio said. “And apparently, with our growing mystery.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio set her phone on speaker, glancing at Agatha with a hint of amusement in her eyes. Agatha was seated across from her at the cottage’s cozy dining table, sipping a glass of wine with a look of curiosity. Wanda was settled in the corner, enjoying the atmosphere with a quiet smirk on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, here she comes,” Rio said, pressing the call button. “Brace yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The phone rang a couple of times before Alice’s familiar voice echoed through the speakers. “What’s up, my favorite troublemaker?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Al,” Rio started, settling in beside Agatha. “I’ve got something weird to run by you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it about your—what was it again, your ‘charming herbalist’?” Alice teased. “Cause I’m still waiting for the juicy details.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flushed, casting a glance at Agatha, who smiled slyly over the rim of her glass. Agatha had, of course, overheard Alice’s earlier comments.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, yeah,” Rio said, her voice flat as she ran a hand through her hair. “Actually, funny you should bring that up… Because Agatha’s right here. And, um, her best friend Wanda is too. So… you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a beat of stunned silence on the other end of the line before Alice exploded in a fit of laughter. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seriously,” Rio groaned, burying her face in her hands. “So please, behave.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned in toward the phone with an exaggerated sweetness in her voice. “Hi, Alice. Nice to see you again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, this is </span>
<em>
<span>gold. </span>
</em>
<span>Hi, hot apothecary lady.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda raised her glass to the phone. “Cheers to interesting company.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked away, mortified, as Agatha smirked knowingly. Alice, of course, wasn’t holding back. “Oh, I have so many questions, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop it,” Rio groaned. “Let me get to the point, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, right. What’s going on?” Alice said, pulling it back to business, though her teasing tone was still there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, so here’s the deal,” Rio said, leaning forward. “There’s a woman in town. Claims she’s a folklorist, doing research on local myths—specifically on the whole Thread legend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Thread?” Alice’s voice shifted slightly, more interested. “Huh, that sounds like a rabbit hole. And… you’re calling me for what, a backstory dive?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, yeah. But there’s something off about her, Alice. She mentioned stuff she shouldn’t really know. And, like, the vibe is just… wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wrong how?” Alice asked, her curiosity piqued.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” Rio admitted. “It’s hard to put into words, but it’s like she knows too much for someone who’s just researching it academically. Something doesn’t sit right, and I need to know what she’s really after.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda shifted in her chair, sensing the tension. “You’ve got the name of the university, right? The one she claimed to be working with?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do. I’ll text it to you,” Rio said, grabbing her phone and quickly typing it out to Alice. “Just… keep it under wraps for now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You got it,” Alice said, the teasing edge to her voice finally fading. “Give me a few hours to dig through the deep web and see what I can find. Don’t get too lost in whatever this mystery is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re the best,” Rio said, grateful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, and hey,” Alice added, “I want all the dirty details later.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, not looking up from her phone, muttered, “Jesus Christ, Al. She’s right here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s voice dropped, though she clearly didn’t regret it one bit. “Nice. All right, I’ll check in later. Keep me posted on whatever weirdness is going down. Be careful, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will,” Rio replied before ending the call, turning her phone off. She dropped it onto the table, where it buzzed with a notification she ignored.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your friend is a bit of a handful, huh?” Agatha teased, an amused gleam in her eye.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not even going to try to explain that woman to you,” Rio muttered, but there was a fondness in her tone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, however, had no such reservations. “Oh, I love her,” she said, her grin wide. “Sounds like she’s a bit of a character.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can we focus on the weirdness at hand, please?” Rio sighed, sitting back in her chair. “What’s our next move?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Agatha began, her voice lowering to something more serious, “we’ve got a lead. And while I’m sure Alice is amazing at hacking her way through this stuff, I think we might need to take a more hands-on approach…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at Agatha, the weight of the situation settling on her shoulders. “You mean… magic?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda sat up a little straighter, her gaze sharp as it flicked between Rio and Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“All right,” she said, setting the glass down with a soft clink. “This folklorist lady—let’s just stop pretending she’s here for a dissertation. You said she gave you the creeps, Ags. That doesn’t happen often.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly from her spot on the couch, where she was curled into Rio’s side, one of Rio’s hands resting warmly on her thigh. “She was… too smooth. Too charming. There was something about her eyes—like she was always two steps ahead of the conversation. And the way she asked about the Threads… It didn’t feel like academic curiosity.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brows lifted. “You didn’t tell her anything, did you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course not.” Agatha’s voice was firm. “But she knows something. And she didn’t just happen to show up in Thistle Grove today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda leaned back in her chair, looking thoughtful. “Then we should find out who she really is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “We already have Alice doing that for us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda gave her a withering look. “And you think the Watchers have LinkedIn profiles?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed under her breath and muttered, “Apparently not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda turned to her, smiling now. “This is a perfect opportunity, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For what?” Rio asked, even though something in her chest already knew.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s eyes glinted with mischief and gravity in equal measure. “Your first spell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted beside her. “Wanda—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Wanda waved her off. “You’ve been channeling power without even trying, Rio. This way, you can do it with intent. With control. Besides, if this woman is a threat, we need to know what we’re dealing with. You’ve got the fire, Ags has the focus, and I’ve got the backup wine and enough magical common sense to hold the room together. So.” She clapped her hands once. “Let’s conjure us a truth.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at Agatha, nervous but eager. “You think I can do this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha studied her, then took her hand. “I know you can.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Within minutes, they’d cleared the coffee table and started setting up the circle. Wanda pulled supplies from her bag with a flourish—candles, salt, herbs, and an obsidian mirror that shimmered faintly even in the cottage’s soft light.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha guided Rio through the setup, her voice calm and even. “This will work like a scrying focus,” she said, gesturing to the mirror. “But since only I’ve seen her, you’ll need to use my memory. Let me guide you through it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed. “Is that safe?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, from where she was tying a bundle of rosemary, smirked. “With Agatha? Absolutely.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored her. She knelt in front of Rio, close enough that their knees touched. “Take my hands. I want you to close your eyes and breathe with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio did, heart thudding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to give you the memory,” Agatha said gently, her voice soft like a spell in itself. “Just a flash of her face. Her voice. The way the air felt when she walked into the shop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled, nodding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers threaded through hers. And then, like flipping through pages in the dark, Rio felt it. A crisp voice with something oily beneath it. Pale eyes, almost silver. A smile too polished. The scent of old parchment and pressed flowers. And power, just under the surface, coiled tight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her breath caught.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Agatha whispered. “You’ve got her. Now say it with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They repeated the spell together, voices weaving:</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Through sight unseen and veil drawn tight,</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Reveal the truth. Restore the light.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The mirror clouded, then shimmered. For a long second, nothing happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then: a flicker.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A woman with sleek dark hair, standing in front of the apothecary. That same pale smile. A glint of silver around her neck—an amulet etched with runes that pulsed faintly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The image sharpened: the woman stepping into a quiet inn, greeted by someone cloaked in shadows. She handed the amulet over with a murmured phrase that didn’t quite carry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The mirror went dark.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes flew open. Her fingers were trembling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Holy shit,” she breathed. “I saw her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squeezed her hands tightly. “You did it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda set her wine glass down with a soft thunk, her eyes on the now-dark mirror. “All right,” she said, voice low and no longer teasing. “That woman didn’t just come here for folklore. The amulet she was wearing—bloodline magic. Old and very specific.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced at Agatha, then back at Wanda. “Wait—what does that mean? Bloodline magic?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda turned to face her fully. “It means she didn’t just stumble into that charm at some antique store. It was passed down, or stolen from someone who had magic in their blood. And the kind that lets you walk into a room and mask your presence from another witch? That’s not beginner stuff.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But who would want to hide from you?” Rio asked, voice quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled. “That’s what we’re trying to figure out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s eyes didn’t leave Rio’s. “You ever heard of the Watchers?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. “No. Should I have?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re not a group you’d hear about unless you were born into magic or stepped on their toes.” Wanda leaned back slightly. “They don’t practice openly. They observe, record, and occasionally… interfere. Always in the name of keeping the balance. But that ‘balance’ usually just means suppressing the witches they think are too powerful or too unpredictable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowned. “So they’re like magical cops?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a soft laugh, bitter around the edges. “More like inquisitors with a better PR team.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda nodded grimly. “They don’t care that we’re not part of any coven or order. That we’ve been on our own our whole lives. What matters to them is potential. And the three of us—whether we like it or not—we carry something old. Ancient. Something they fear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Threads,” Rio said softly, piecing it together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” Wanda said. “We’re not just some mystical lineage that makes flowers bloom or visions appear in tea leaves. When the three Threads are aligned—when we’re present and connected—our magic doesn’t just flow. It amplifies. It reshapes. And that scares them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath caught in her throat. She looked at Agatha, who held her gaze, calm and solid, despite everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda went on, her voice gentler now. “I don’t think this woman is a Watcher. Not officially. But the charm? The way she hid herself? She’s trained. Either she’s one of them, or she learned from them. And if she’s poking around myths about the Threads, she’s looking for something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw clenched. “Us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda said, looking at both of them. “All three of us. We are the key to a shitload of power. But only if we stop being afraid of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A long silence settled between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Rio said, steady and sure, “Then we learn. We prepare. And we don’t let her take anything from us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda raised her glass again, a proud smile touching her lips. “Look at you. Already talking like a Thread.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head with a soft chuckle, eyes warm as they settled on Rio. “God help us all.”</span>
</p><p>

<p>
<span>A few hours and a couple of bottles of wine later, Wanda tossed her scarf around her neck with a flourish and raised an eyebrow at both of them as she reached for the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Try not to fry the power grid again, will you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s jaw dropped as she turned to Agatha, mortified. “You </span>
<em>
<span>told</span>
</em>
<span> her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t have to,” Agatha said smoothly, eyes glittering with mischief. “Wanda’s a nosy bloodhound when it comes to excess magical discharge.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda snorted, already halfway out the door. “You’re lucky I like you both. Enjoy your night, lovebirds. Keep it grounded, if you can.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door closed behind her with a click, and silence settled like a blanket around them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned slowly toward Agatha, narrow-eyed. “Excess magical discharge?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged innocently and stepped closer. “You’re the one who literally blew a fuse.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did not—” Rio sputtered, then groaned and buried her face in Agatha’s neck. “I’m never going to live this down.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, low and sweet, her hands sliding around Rio’s waist. “You’ll survive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed her before she could make another quip, and that was the moment the shift happened again—something deeper taking hold. The kind of kiss that ached with everything they hadn’t said out loud, with gratitude and longing and the sharp, dizzying relief of finally.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They didn’t rush this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was too much to feel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers skimmed along the small of Rio’s back as they undressed each other slowly, clothes slipping off with reverence, not urgency. Each kiss, each graze of skin to skin, was a rediscovery. A memory whispered back into being.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio guided Agatha to the stairs and into the bedroom, their limbs tangling like they had so many times in dreams. Only this time it was real. This time Agatha moaned when Rio’s mouth found the hollow of her throat. This time Rio gasped when Agatha’s hands gripped her hips, grounding her, anchoring her. Every touch crackled—not just with magic, but with meaning. With emotion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They didn’t speak for a long while.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was no need.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s name spilled from Rio’s lips in a breathless prayer when she came, and Agatha clung to her like she needed her more than air. Rio didn’t wait to catch her breath before kissing Agatha again, slower this time, sinking into the pleasure of making her unravel, of learning what made her sigh and keen and whisper curses into her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha came again, magic flared low and warm in the air—but the lights held. The cottage buzzed gently around them, energy coursing through the walls but no longer in chaos. It responded to them. Balanced.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed softly against Rio’s neck, limbs heavy, content. “We only flickered the lights this time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a breathless laugh, brushing Agatha’s damp hair away from her cheek. “Wanda would be so proud.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her head slightly, kissed the inside of Rio’s wrist. “She’d probably call us underachievers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They lay in a mess of blankets, flushed and tangled, bodies still humming. Rio dragged a finger lazily along Agatha’s spine, feeling the sharp edges of longing soften into something gentle, something real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a long moment, Rio whispered, “I didn’t think I could feel this way again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched. She lifted her head, propped it on her hand so she could look at her. “Me neither.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The weight of it settled between them—not heavy, but real. Welcome. Scary, but somehow right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They didn’t need to say what this was. Not yet. But it shimmered around them like a truth too bright to ignore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, Rio pulled a throw blanket up over both of them. The night deepened. Salem, having returned at some point, perched on a windowsill in another room, wisely keeping his distance from the emotional—and magical—carnage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think we traumatized my cat,” Rio mumbled into Agatha’s hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted. “Good. That smug little gremlin has it too easy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They fell asleep wrapped around each other, magic curled like a living thing between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio’s dreams were waiting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the stillness of the night, Rio’s mind drifted into something deeper. She could feel the pull of it—like the weight of an ocean just beneath the surface, waiting to swallow her whole. It started like a whisper, soft but unmistakable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, in a blink, everything changed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The cottage, with its warm walls and familiar scent of herbs, faded away. The air grew cold, and Rio was standing in a dense forest. The trees were tall, their trunks dark and twisted, their branches forming a canopy so thick it blotted out the sky. There was no sun, no light to guide her. Only the faintest glow of something distant, pulsing like a heartbeat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s feet were bare against the forest floor, the cool, damp earth pressing up against her skin. She felt it before she saw it—the weight of a thousand eyes on her, the sensation of being watched by something ancient, something far older than the trees themselves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart pounded, but her feet kept moving. Something tugged at her, pulling her deeper into the forest. She followed the path laid out in front of her, branches reaching toward her like hands, urging her forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she moved, shadows seemed to flicker just beyond her peripheral vision, but whenever she turned her head, they vanished. Her breath quickened, and her steps faltered as she reached the edge of a clearing. There, standing in the center, was a figure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A woman, tall and regal, with long dark hair that flowed like liquid midnight. She wore robes of deep violet, embroidered with threads of gold, and her eyes—when they met Rio’s—glowed like stars. They were older, wise, and infinite, like they carried the weight of ages, and they locked onto Rio’s with an unspoken understanding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman didn’t speak, but Rio could feel her presence like a shock through her entire being. It was as if the woman’s essence was both an invitation and a warning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who are you?” Rio asked, her voice a whisper against the silence of the forest. But the words felt hollow, useless. She already knew the answer before she could even form it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman stepped forward, and the ground beneath her feet seemed to shift, like the earth itself was bending to her will. She raised a hand, and suddenly the trees around them groaned, their bark splitting open to reveal glimpses of hidden things—eyes, teeth, shapes that should not exist in this world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman’s lips parted in a slight, knowing smile, and Rio felt a pull in her chest, something magnetizing her to the woman’s very being. Come closer, the figure seemed to beckon, though no words were spoken.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t resist. Her feet moved of their own accord, drawn toward the woman in the center of the clearing, her heart beating louder now, the pulse in her chest almost deafening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” Rio whispered, barely able to breathe. “Why am I here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman’s smile widened, but her eyes never left Rio’s, and Rio felt the weight of centuries settle in her bones.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because you are the last of them,” the woman said, her voice both a lullaby and a warning. “The last of them all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could speak, a sharp pain erupted in her chest—like something tearing through her, a rip in the fabric of her own soul. She stumbled back, clutching at her heart, gasping for air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly, the woman was gone. The forest shifted and swirled, becoming a blur of shadow and light, a dizzying whirlpool of impossible shapes. The trees vanished, and in their place was nothing but emptiness, an infinite void that stretched on forever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, the figure’s voice came again, but it was not the woman now—it was something darker, something ancient.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Remember. Remember the threads. Remember your blood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The ground beneath her feet cracked, and Rio fell, her scream swallowed by the vast nothingness that surrounded her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes snapped open. She gasped for air, her pulse racing as if she had just sprinted through the forest, as if she had just been caught in the grasp of that pull. Her body was slick with sweat, her heart still pounding from the vividness of the dream.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The cottage around her was still dark, quiet, except for the sound of Agatha’s soft breathing beside her. Rio’s hand shot out, finding her. She gripped Agatha’s wrist, her fingers trembling. Agatha stirred but didn’t wake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The last of them. The words echoed in Rio’s mind, leaving her shaken. Who had she seen? What had just happened?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mind raced, but one thing was certain—this wasn’t just a dream. It was a message. A warning. A call.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio had no idea what it all meant. But she felt, in every fiber of her being, that the time was coming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned over and buried her face against Agatha’s chest, trying to calm the storm that raged inside her. Whatever this was, whatever was happening to her, it was far from over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>She finally managed to drift back to sleep, though her mind still raced with the echoes of the previous dream. The shadows of the woman, the pull, and the words “the last of them” clung to her like a fog.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But this time, the dream came differently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The darkness was softer now, gentler. She found herself standing in the same dense forest from before, but it wasn’t as foreboding. The trees were no longer twisted, and the air wasn’t heavy with something ancient. Instead, it was a place that she felt like she knew—like something she hadn’t thought about in years.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was a child again, around 7 or 8 years old, running freely through the same forest behind the cottage. The scent of damp earth and pine filled her nose, the crunch of leaves underfoot as she dashed along, laughing, her small hands brushing the underbrush. There was sunlight filtering through the trees now, golden and warm, and she felt light—lighter than she ever remembered feeling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she heard it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft, melodic voice, gentle but powerful, a lullaby that echoed through the trees, like the earth itself was singing. Rio slowed to a stop, her little face tilting up to listen. The voice was familiar, even though she couldn’t place it. It was as if it had been part of her for as long as she could remember, as if it had always been there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked around, trying to find the source, but the voice seemed to be all around her, in the air, in the earth, and it made her feel safe—like nothing bad could happen in this place, in this moment. She smiled, eyes closing for a brief second, letting the sound wash over her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, just as suddenly, the lullaby ended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned around, feeling an overwhelming sense of longing, as if something precious was slipping away. The dream flickered, the woods blurring around her. She reached out, but everything was fading, dissolving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio jolted awake, her eyes snapping open, her heart racing again, but this time in a different way. The warmth of the cottage still surrounded her, the soft rustle of the night air through the window beside the bed. But something about this dream felt different.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t shaken by fear or confusion this time. Instead, she felt… content. A sense of calmness washed over her. She smiled softly to herself, the memory of the lullaby lingering in her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the smile quickly faltered as the confusion crept back in. It didn’t feel like a dream at all. It felt too real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had never run through the forest behind the cottage as a child. She had never heard a lullaby sung to her before. And yet, it all felt so familiar. Almost like… like a memory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to look at Agatha, who was still peacefully sleeping beside her. The soft rise and fall of her chest was steady and comforting. Rio didn’t want to disturb her, but the weight of what she’d just experienced was too much to ignore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The lullaby. The forest. The feeling of being cared for, protected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t shake the sense that something had been lost—something important, something that had been a part of her, but was now out of reach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She rolled onto her side, reaching out to gently brush a lock of Agatha’s hair from her face, her fingers brushing the smoothness of her skin. The connection between them was real, undeniable, but this dream… this memory… Rio couldn’t help but feel it was tied to something more—something from before, something that was waiting for her to remember.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But for now, all she could do was lie there, feeling the warmth of Agatha’s body against her own, and try to understand what had just happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe, just maybe, it would all make sense soon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lay awake, her thoughts swirling around the dreams that haunted her from the night. The first one, the one that had rattled her awake earlier, still felt so vivid, like a pulse running through her veins. It was a warning, something ancient, and yet it was calling her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The second one, though, had felt like a forgotten piece of her life slipping back into place. It had been warm, comforting, nostalgic. But the first one was different.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned toward Agatha, still asleep beside her. Her breath was steady, soft, but Rio could feel the pull to talk. To explain everything she’d experienced. She wanted to share it. She needed to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The soft morning light trickled in through the curtains, casting a warm glow over Agatha’s face. Rio couldn’t help herself. She kissed Agatha’s neck, soft and slow, just like the way her heart fluttered at the thought of the dreams. Agatha stirred, blinking up at Rio with a sleepy smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning,” Agatha mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning,” Rio murmured, leaning in for another kiss. This time it was a little deeper, lingering, as if she were trying to anchor herself to something real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha returned the kiss, but the alarm interrupted their moment with a jarring buzz. Agatha groaned, clearly not ready to face the day just yet, but she didn’t move to silence it immediately. Instead, she relaxed back into Rio’s arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled her closer, tucking her face into Agatha’s neck. “Let’s just stay like this a bit longer,” she whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled softly but didn’t argue. They stayed tangled in the sheets, neither of them ready for the day to begin. But Rio’s mind wouldn’t let go of the dreams, especially the first one—the one that had felt so vivid, so real. She couldn’t keep it inside any longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio whispered into her skin. “I need to tell you something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked slowly, her eyes still hazy with sleep. “What’s wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I had another dream,” Rio said, her voice hesitant. She pulled back just enough to look into Agatha’s eyes. “But it’s… different this time. It feels like a warning, I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brow furrowed in curiosity, her usual calm attentiveness taking over. “What kind of warning?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The first dream,” Rio began, her voice quieter now, more fragile. “The one where I was in a dark forest. There was a woman, but like…I don’t know, she felt…otherworldly? And she said that I was the last of them, whatever that is.” She took a breath, remembering the sharp pain in her chest as the woman’s words pierced through her. “And then something happened, I don’t know. But it was like my chest was on fire, like I’d been hit with something? And then another voice said that I should remember the Threads. Remember my blood.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s expression shifted, her gaze intent as she listened, her fingers lightly brushing Rio’s cheek. “That was the first dream?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio replied. “And it felt so… real. Like I wasn’t dreaming at all. Like I was there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She paused, trying to find the right words to explain it all. “The forest was so dark, Agatha. So thick with trees that the sun couldn’t even break through. And the air was… heavy. There was this feeling of being watched. Like something ancient was out there, just waiting. But when I saw her—the woman—everything froze. She looked so powerful, but… also like she was waiting for me. And her eyes—Agatha, they were so old. I don’t know how to explain it, but it felt like… like she knew me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha listened intently, her eyes never leaving Rio’s face, absorbing every detail. Rio’s voice trembled as she continued, the weight of the dream pressing down on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When she spoke, it wasn’t just her voice. It was like the whole forest spoke through her. Like everything around us understood that I was supposed to be there. She said I was the last of them… but I don’t even know who </span>
<em>
<span>they</span>
</em>
<span> are. I could feel her, Agatha. Like she was… inside me, too. And then… I don’t know what happened. The pain in my chest—sharp, like something tore through me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath hitched as the memory lingered, almost too overwhelming to handle. She rubbed her chest absentmindedly, as though the phantom pain still lingered. “I don’t know why, but I think she was trying to tell me something. Something important. But I don’t know what it was.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached out, gently cupping Rio’s face in her hands, grounding her. “The last of them… the forest… this woman. It sounds like she’s tied to something ancient. To your blood, Rio. And whatever this is, whatever you’re remembering, it might be bigger than you think.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded slowly, her heart still racing from the intensity of the dream. “But what does it mean? Why now? And who the hell is she, Agatha? What does she want with me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kissed her forehead gently, the weight of the moment settling around them. “I don’t know, but I think it’s time you started looking for answers. The magic… your magic… it’s awakening, and it’s calling you to something. She is calling you, and I think we’ll start to understand why when you follow the trail of these dreams.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt a shiver of understanding run through her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, what should I do?” Rio asked, her voice small but determined. “What’s my next step?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a soft, reassuring smile. “You start by writing it down. Every feeling, every detail. Your magic is awakening, and that’s probably activating things inside you. This is how you’ll begin to understand it. Write it in the grimoire. Let it guide you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart fluttered at Agatha’s words. A guide. That was what she needed—something to help her make sense of this. And Agatha, with her quiet strength and wisdom, was there to help her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio whispered, feeling a spark of determination. “I’ll do that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But just before Agatha could respond, Rio hesitated, her thoughts shifting. “There’s… something else,” she said, her voice uncertain, but more grounded now. “After that first dream… I had another one. But this one was different. It didn’t feel like a warning or something dark. It was… warm. It was like… a memory of me as a child. I was running through that same forest. The trees weren’t dark and twisted this time. They were alive—light was filtering through them. I remember laughing. And then I heard a voice, soft and sweet, singing a lullaby.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused, blinking in confusion. “It felt like a memory. But it also didn’t. It was like I was the child, running and laughing, but… but it wasn’t something I actually remember. I know it’s something I’ve never lived through because I’d never even been in a forest like this as a child. But It was like the forest was mine, like it was part of me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes softened as she listened, her hand moving to caress Rio’s arm gently. “It sounds like you’re beginning to remember pieces of yourself, Rio. Your connection to the forest… to your bloodline. That lullaby… it might be something passed down, something you’re remembering. It’s like your past is coming to meet you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her, a bit overwhelmed by everything. “But why now, Agatha? Why do I feel like these memories are surfacing all of a sudden?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled gently, brushing a lock of hair away from Rio’s face. “Because your magic is flooding your system as it awakens. It’s calling you to remember who you are, to understand the threads of your past. And as much as it might scare you, Rio, it’s guiding you. It’s bringing you back to yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded slowly, the weight of everything settling in. “So… I write it down. I’ll start with the grimoire. I have to remember.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kissed her softly, her eyes full of warmth and quiet confidence. “You’ll figure it out, sweetheart. One step at a time. And you’re not doing this alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned into her, feeling the weight of the world—of whatever was happening to her—lighten just a little. She wasn’t alone anymore. Not with Agatha by her side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The world outside was already warming with morning sun, the soft golden light filtering through the windows and casting long lines across the floor. But the cottage remained quiet, almost reluctant to shake off the remnants of dreams and magic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, Rio and Agatha pulled themselves from the warmth of the sheets. The scent of fresh coffee drifted in from the kitchen—Agatha had charmed the coffee maker, clearly anticipating the struggle of waking up after a night like that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio padded barefoot across the wood floor, tugging on Agatha’s oversized sweater she’d borrowed the night before. She opened the curtains in the living room to let the sunlight in, yawning as she glanced over the mess of sketchbooks and loose pages scattered across the low coffee table. Her notes from the last few days—visions, dreams, plants, memories—blurred together like a chaotic tapestry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha emerged a few minutes later looking casually beautiful, dressed in a deep green blouse and black jeans, her hair swept up casually but still somehow perfect. “I’ve got to open the shop in an hour,” she said, pouring herself a mug of coffee.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They made breakfast together—scrambled eggs, toast, fruit—quietly moving around each other like a familiar dance. Comfortable. Easy. Rio’s mind buzzed with the memories from the night before, but there was something reassuring about the clink of silverware and the smell of toast. Grounding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After they ate, Rio sat cross-legged on the couch, her laptop propped up on a pillow, papers spread around her. She chewed on the end of a pen as she flipped through one of her sketchbooks, the edges smudged with charcoal and ink. “Okay,” she said aloud to no one in particular. “Outline time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve got a lot to work with now,” Agatha said as she pulled on her coat near the door. “Whatever’s waking up in you—it’s practically writing itself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “Yeah, it’s just figuring out how to frame it. I think I want to center the main character around someone who’s forgotten her past but slowly realizes she’s tied to something bigger. Maybe magic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked back at her with a faint smile. “Sounds familiar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could respond, a low, offended meow rang out from the hallway. Salem emerged dramatically from under a chair, his fur puffed up slightly, tail flicking with irritation. He paused at the edge of the rug, staring at them both with pure feline judgment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “Oh no. Don’t tell me…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Salem narrowed his eyes and gave another yowl that translated perfectly as </span>
<em>
<span>How dare you banish me while you desecrated the couch? Again</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stifled a laugh behind her mug. “Looks like someone is sulking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned and dropped her head back on the couch. “We need to start giving him a heads up or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He had a heads up,” Agatha said, walking over and crouching beside the couch to scratch behind Salem’s ears. “He chose drama.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Salem swatted lightly at her hand in punishment, then leapt up onto the back of the couch with a dramatic huff, flopping down beside Rio and staring at her like she owed him rent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think he forgives you,” Agatha said, amused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached up and scratched Salem’s chin cautiously. “Thanks, your majesty.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a final sip of coffee, Agatha grabbed her keys. “I gotta go. Try not to let the cat guilt you into giving him all the snacks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No promises,” Rio called after her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the door closed behind Agatha, Rio looked around the cozy, cluttered living room. Her laptop pinged softly, the blank outline waiting for her to fill it in. She took a deep breath, then set her fingers to the keys.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was time to start telling the story.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The cursor blinked on her screen, taunting her, but for once, Rio didn’t mind. She’d actually managed to map out a solid first act and several anchor points for the graphic novel’s arc, and the ideas weren’t slowing down. If anything, they were racing ahead of her, demanding to be captured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat back, stretching with a satisfied groan, then slid off the couch and padded into the kitchen for a second—okay, third—cup of coffee. Salem followed her, but when she offered him a piece of toast, he turned his nose up with disdain and leapt onto the windowsill instead, basking in a patch of light like the world’s most judgmental gargoyle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed and wandered back to the living room. Her gaze fell on the grimoire, still resting on the side table near the bundle of lavender Agatha had left the first night she’d come by. It hadn’t moved since. She stared at it for a moment, heart slowly picking up speed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The dreams. She needed to write them down before they began to blur, or worse, fade completely. She should have done it already.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She set her coffee down and gently opened the cover. The pages still smelled faintly of dried herbs and ink, the binding creaking just a little like it hadn’t been opened in years. Rio hesitated, her fingers brushing over the thick parchment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she reached for her pen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment her fingers wrapped around it, a small shiver ran through her—goosebumps rose along her arms, and the room seemed to shift slightly around her. The air grew thicker, warmer, charged. Not in a dangerous way, but in a way that made her feel… seen. Acknowledged. Like the cottage itself was holding its breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This is real, she thought. This is mine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She found a blank page near the middle—one untouched by Eliza’s spidery handwriting or the scattered botanical illustrations—and slowly began to write.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Last night, I dreamed of a woman in a forest…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She poured it all out: the cold earth beneath her bare feet, the flickering shadows, the woman’s eyes—glowing like stars. The teeth in the trees. The words “You are the last of them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hand didn’t shake, but her heart did. Still, she didn’t stop. She moved on to the second dream, the one that left her with a strange warmth in her chest. She described the lullaby—its eerie familiarity, the way it tugged at something ancient in her bones. The forest behind the cottage. The way the child had laughed. The way it had felt like her laugh. Like home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she finally stopped, the page was nearly full. She looked down at what she had written, the ink still glistening slightly in the late morning light, and felt something shift inside her—an anchor dropping into place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was the first time she had written in the grimoire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first time she had claimed it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first time she had truly, consciously stepped into the magic that had been waiting for her all along.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed the book gently, pressing her palm against the cover for a long moment. Then she exhaled and leaned back into the couch, staring at the ceiling with a faint smile, heart still pounding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Outside the window, the breeze stirred the branches of the old trees lining the property, and somewhere far off in the woods, a bird sang a melody that almost—almost—echoed the lullaby from her dream.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had just set the grimoire aside when her phone buzzed from the arm of the couch. She reached for it, expecting a check-in from Agatha, but the screen lit up with Alice Wu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She answered with a warm, “Hey, stranger.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice didn’t waste time. “Okay, I’ve got something. And I’m telling you now, it’s giving serious horror movie vibes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat up straighter, heart kicking up a notch. “About Mara Greaves?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yup. So, first off, there’s basically no online presence for her. No Twitter, no Instagram, no LinkedIn, no professional website. Even the university mentions are dusty—like, early 2000s dusty.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So she’s either off the grid or doesn’t want to be found.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly. But here’s where it gets weird. I found a handful of papers published under her name, mostly in niche folklore and anthropology journals—legit enough, if a little… fringe. But the content? It starts out all historical—ancient rites, bloodlines, matrilineal myths—but then it veers. She gets obsessed with these so-called ‘hereditary lineages’ and something she calls ‘The Bound Three.’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “The what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right? It sounded like a cult or a fairytale. But she writes about it like it’s real. There’s a pattern in the writing, too—women in threes, tied by blood, by fate, blah blah blah. Like myth meets conspiracy theory.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A chill worked its way up Rio’s spine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I even found a post on an old academic blog—someone claiming Mara Greaves might be a pseudonym. And get this, the name that kept coming up as an alternate was ‘Dahlia.’ Just Dahlia. You know, like Cher. Or Zendaya.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio went still. “Dahlia,” she repeated slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know her?” Alice asked, tone suddenly serious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. I don’t think so,” Rio said, a little too quickly. “The name’s just… familiar, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I don’t know what you’re doing in that little town, but I’m telling you, if you see a woman in a velvet cloak offering you tea made from grave moss or whatever, run.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a weak laugh. “Noted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean it. You and weirdness are a magnet lately.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have no idea,” Rio murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What was that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing,” she said quickly. “Thanks for looking into her, Al. You’re the best.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You owe me pie. And a beer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Consider it done. I’ll call you soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Be safe, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will. Promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ended the call, phone resting in her palm as her mind spun. Dahlia. The Bound Three. A folklorist who didn’t really exist. Her fingers drifted toward the grimoire again, a pulse fluttering beneath her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This wasn’t folklore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was her life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sun was bright over Thistle Grove, but it did little to warm the chill working its way down Rio’s spine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t intended to go far—just a quick walk, clear her head after the call with Alice and the restless energy from her dreams. Maybe drop by the apothecary, see Agatha, maybe kiss her stupid and pretend the world wasn’t creeping closer with every strange thread that pulled tighter around her life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was halfway through the square, coffee in one hand, sketchbook tucked under her arm, when she saw her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A woman standing outside the antique store, her posture graceful but unnervingly still. Her coat was deep plum, the fabric old-fashioned and beautifully made, silver buttons glinting in the sunlight. She was speaking to Mr. Delaney, the shopkeeper, who was laughing nervously at something she’d said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stopped in her tracks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d seen it before—last night, behind Agatha’s eyes, when Wanda guided her into the spell. She knew that long, dark coat, the pale streak of hair, the unnerving calm that radiated off her like a second skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mara Greaves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Except the memory hadn’t done her justice. In real life, she was worse—more vivid, more magnetic. And those eyes… those eyes turned on Rio the moment she looked too long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mara’s gaze cut through the air between them, as though she’d felt Rio’s recognition like a flare in the dark.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath caught.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mara didn’t speak. She only offered a small, curious smile. Not warm. Not threatening either. Just… weird. Like she’d been waiting for Rio to catch up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers tightened around her coffee cup.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned abruptly and walked—fast—toward the apothecary, heart hammering against her ribs. She didn’t look back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t have to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could still feel those eyes on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bell above the apothecary door gave its usual cheerful chime as Rio stepped inside, but she barely noticed it. Her thoughts were a blur, her stomach tight. She kept her expression carefully blank as she crossed the threshold, forcing herself to breathe like a normal person. Just another morning. Just another visit to see her maybe-girlfriend-maybe-more who also happened to be a witch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood behind the counter, her hair pinned back loosely, sleeves rolled up, helping a trio of tourists sniff their way through a set of spell candles. She glanced up at the sound of the bell, her eyes catching Rio’s—and something in her gaze sharpened immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she didn’t say a word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio offered a tight smile and moved to the shelves, pretending to examine a jar of lavender bath salts while her brain scrambled to keep her heart from jumping out of her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mara Greaves had stared at her like she’d seen her before—like she knew.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And after what Alice told her on the phone—about how Mara had lied about being a folklorist, how her credentials didn’t quite line up… it was all just a little too much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t even remember walking here. Her body had just moved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, the customers made their purchases and left in a flurry of bags and thank-yous. Agatha locked the door behind them, flipped the sign, and then turned slowly toward Rio, her brow already furrowing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she said, voice low. “What happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her for a beat, then exhaled through her nose and crossed the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I saw her,” she said. “Mara Greaves. She was talking to Delaney near the bookstore. And when I walked past… she looked at me. Like—like she recognized me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “Recognized you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “It wasn’t just a glance. She paused. Her whole face changed, like she was trying to place me. And it felt—Agatha, it felt wrong. It gave me chills.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hesitated, then added, “Alice called. Said she what she could find on Mara Greaves was sketchy at best. And get this, her supposed research centers around bloodlines and what she called the bound three or something like that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face had gone very still. “She’s not just some nosy folklorist.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio said. “She’s something else. And it looks like she knows who I am. Just like she knew who you were.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached for her, hands settling gently on her arms. “Okay. That’s what we needed to know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry I barged in—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t be.” Her voice was firmer now. “You did the right thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed. “So what do we do?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced toward the back of the shop, then leaned in. “We keep playing it cool. But tonight, we’re calling Wanda. We need to start thinking about defense, especially for you. And we’re going to figure out exactly what this woman wants.”</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha knew something was wrong the second Rio walked into the shop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was too still. Too careful. She didn’t offer one of her usual quips or sidelong smirks. Just a polite nod, as if she were a stranger walking into an unfamiliar place. Her eyes skimmed the shelves but didn’t see anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha played it cool, keeping one eye on the tourists as she rang up their candles, but her attention was fully on Rio—every twitch of her hand, the tightness in her jaw. By the time the last customer left and the door clicked shut, she had already flipped the sign to closed for lunch and was rounding the counter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she said softly. “What happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio told her everything. About Mara. About the way she’d looked at her. About the phone call from Alice and the false identities and the deep, aching feeling that none of this was a coincidence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time she finished, Agatha could see the crackle of fear behind her eyes, the way she clutched her own arms like she didn’t trust her body to stay grounded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t hesitate. She stepped forward and slid her hands up Rio’s arms, then cupped her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Breathe,” she murmured. “You’re okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio started to nod, but Agatha leaned in and kissed her—not rushed, not fiery, just soft and steady. Grounding. Their mouths fit together easily, familiarly now, like muscle memory. Agatha kissed her again, slower this time, and felt Rio begin to melt a little in her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they parted, Rio’s eyes had softened just a touch, but her brow was still furrowed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m still a little freaked out,” she whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d be more worried if you weren’t,” Agatha said gently. “But you’re not alone, okay? You have me. You have Wanda. We’ll figure out what she’s doing here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded slowly. “What time is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Almost noon. Wanna step out? I need a break too. And I know Wanda only has classes until twelve today—we can pick her up and head back to her place.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio managed a faint smile. “You think Wanda will feed us?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned. “I know she will. She cooks when she’s stressed out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She grabbed her coat, slipped a “Back at 2pm” sign in the window, and took Rio’s hand without thinking. It felt natural now, easy. Even when everything else was spiraling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they stepped out into the cool air and started toward the elementary school, Agatha tightened her grip slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was worried, yes. Deeply. But she was also certain of one thing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Whatever Mara Greaves was doing in Thistle Grove—she had just made a serious mistake by getting too close to the Threads.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a slow sip of water before she spoke. “Alice didn’t come up totally empty. There’s some academic record—really obscure—of someone named Mara Greaves from the early 2000s. Something about the ‘Bound Three’. But after that, she just… vanished.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brows drew together. “Vanished, or changed her name?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a tight nod. “That’s the thing. Alice found a name that kept popping up. Someone referred to her as Dahlia. Just Dahlia. No last name. Alice thinks it was the same person. Same research field, same tone of writing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda froze with a fork halfway to her mouth. “Dahlia?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood slowly, moving to her bookshelf, pulling down an old leather-bound tome filled with local stories and folklore. She flipped through it quickly, eyes scanning the pages, until she found what she was looking for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here,” she said, laying the book open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The page was yellowed with age, featuring a faded black-and-white photo: Thistle Grove Harvest Festival, 1958.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the back row, barely visible, stood a woman with dark hair and piercing eyes. Even in the old photograph, something about her was unnerving. Timeless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There,” Wanda said, pointing. “That’s her, isn’t it? She’s never listed with a last name. Just Dahlia. My gran used to tell stories about her. Said she didn’t age. That she showed up every few decades, always asking questions. Listening. Writing things down.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Well, shit. She looks exactly the same. That picture’s over sixty years old.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt the chill crawl up her spine. “And now she’s back in Thistle Grove.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda nodded grimly. “She’s not just a folklorist. She’s something else. And if she looked at you like she recognized you…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She did,” Rio whispered. “She looked right at me, like I was a puzzle she’d already solved.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached over and took her hand. “Then it’s time we figure out what she’s really doing here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time they got back to the cottage, the sky had gone from bright to overcast, the air heavy with the scent of pine and distant rain. Agatha didn’t waste time. As soon as the door closed behind them, she turned to Rio, her tone firm but kind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re going to ward this place,” she said, slipping off her coat and hanging it on the hook by the door. “Top to bottom. Every threshold, every window, even the chimney.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “You mean like… a magical security system?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yup,” Agatha said. “Protection. Repulsion. Confusion for those who don’t belong. It won’t make the place impenetrable, but it’ll slow someone like her down. And that gives us time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, rubbing her arms. “What about Wanda?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told her to do the same. She’ll reinforce the wards around her place before nightfall.” Agatha walked to the hearth and lit a small bundle of dried rosemary and mugwort. The smoke curled upward, fragrant and sharp. “And I’ll be doing mine tonight too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched her for a beat, then stepped closer. “You’re not just going to do it for me, are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to face her, a smile playing faintly on her lips. “Gods, no. I’m going to teach you. You need to know how to focus your magic—not just let it spark when it wants, but use it with control and intent. Especially now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed hard and nodded again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped forward, reaching for her hand. “We’ll start with grounding. Then intent. Then casting. And when we’re done, this place will be yours in every way that matters. Safe. Claimed. Guarded.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words wrapped around Rio like a warm cloak. She squeezed Agatha’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay. Let’s do this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood at the threshold of the cottage, fingers trailing over the weathered wood of the front door. The scent of old pine and drying herbs hung in the air, and the flicker of candlelight softened the corners of the space that had begun, slowly, to feel like a home again. It had always been Eliza’s sanctuary—but now, it belonged to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it needed to be protected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced at Rio, who hovered near the kitchen, arms folded across her chest like she wasn’t sure whether to be anxious or eager.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached into her satchel and pulled out a small pouch of powdered rowan bark and salt, a handful of dried vervain, and a thin, dark-bladed knife. She set it all carefully on the table and met Rio’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come here,” she said gently. “Let’s start with grounding.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio approached and stood in front of her, visibly trying to slow her breathing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took her hands, holding them between her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You already know what magic feels like. You’ve felt it when it erupts—when it reacts. But now I want you to feel it when you reach for it voluntarily. Not when it rushes you. Start by closing your eyes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio obeyed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Feel your breath,” Agatha whispered. “Feel the way it sits in your body. Let it sink down. Down into your ribs, into your hips, into the soles of your feet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence stretched. Outside, the wind rustled the trees, but inside there was only warmth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let her own magic hum low, steady beneath her skin—not enough to interfere, just enough for Rio to feel it if she reached out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brow furrowed slightly, and then smoothed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I feel it,” she murmured. “It’s like—heat. In my chest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled. “Good. That’s your center. Keep that flame steady. Now I want you to imagine that heat flowing into the earth beneath your feet. Like roots. Let it anchor you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She guided Rio through it, feeling the shift in the air as her magic settled—like a thread being slowly woven through the room, stitched into the very bones of the cottage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped back and retrieved the pouch of rowan and salt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is protection. I’ll mark the outer points, but you will seal them. Every line of it will hold stronger if it comes from you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened her eyes, more focused now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do I say?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crouched near the threshold, drawing a small sigil with her finger in the dust. “Words are just tools to direct will. Say what you mean. Mean it. Try: ‘</span>
<em>
<span>None may cross who wish me harm. This space is mine, and mine to keep.’”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio repeated the phrase softly, then again, louder, and when she spoke it a third time, the sigil pulsed faintly, a bronze shimmer before vanishing into the wood grain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “Good. Again. The windows now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They moved through the cottage together, Rio tracing her fingers along the frames, speaking her intent aloud. Each time, the air shifted—not much, just enough that Agatha felt it. The cottage grew warmer, brighter. More alive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t help the thrill of pride that curled in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the hearth, Rio faltered. “I don’t know what to say this time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped close behind her, letting her hands rest lightly on Rio’s hips. “Speak to the fire. Tell it you want it to guard this place. Not to burn, but to watch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, then whispered, “Guard this home, spirit of flame. Burn away what doesn’t belong.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The coals in the hearth flared suddenly, a ripple of orange light licking up toward the chimney, before settling again. Agatha felt the hair on her arms rise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio breathed. “Did I do that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You absolutely did,” Agatha murmured, amazed. “You’re… strong. It’s like your power knows this house already.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned toward her, visibly flushed from focus and wonder. “I think it does. It feels… right. Like it’s answering me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled. “It is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached up and brushed a bit of ash from Rio’s cheek. “Let’s do the back door, and then I’ll show you how to knot wards into string for the window panes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they walked together to the rear of the house, Agatha glanced at her out of the corner of her eye.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had always carried power in her—flickering, stormy, untrained—but now, for the first time, she was channeling it. Owning it. Her magic was still wild, yes, but it was beginning to sharpen. To answer her voice, not just her fear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And gods help anyone who dared try to cross her now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The late afternoon sunlight slanted warmly through the lace curtains of The Hollow, painting golden patterns across the worn wood floors. Wanda and Agatha sat in their usual spot near the front window, nursing mugs of spiced coffee and chatting with Lilia, who hovered behind the counter with a satisfied little smirk like she always knew more than she let on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had been a couple of days since Agatha had taught Rio on how to ward the cottage, and so far, things had been thankfully quiet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was mid-story about one of her particularly precocious students when the door chimed open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They all glanced over casually—but Agatha froze when she saw the woman who stepped inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Short, stylish, slightly frazzled from travel, but unmistakably familiar. Alice Wu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked around the cozy space, clearly scanning for someone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh—hi,” she said, approaching the counter. “I was wondering if you could point me in the direction of Rio Vidal’s place?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia straightened up, her eyes twinkling. “Well now, aren’t you a sight. You must be Alice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s eyes widened slightly. “How do you—?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was when Wanda jumped in and gave her a little wave from the table. “Hi! FaceTime, remember? I’m Wanda. That’s Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice blinked, then grinned. “Right! Right. Wow. Okay—this is a really small town.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood, surprised but amused. “You’re looking for Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah. I wanted to surprise her for her birthday.” She shrugged, the corners of her mouth lifting. “She hates it when I make a big deal out of it, so I figured I’d make a small deal out of it instead. Just show up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “Her birthday?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice tilted her head. “Tomorrow. The 6th. Wait—did she not tell you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda covered her snort behind her mug. Agatha recovered quickly, smoothing over her surprise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, she didn’t mention it,” Agatha said, trying to sound casual, but Wanda could already see the wheels turning behind her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice shook her head with a laugh. “She always pretends it’s just another day, but I figured, you know… new town, new start. I couldn’t let her be alone. Especially not this year.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, she’s definitely not alone,” Agatha said before she could stop herself, voice soft but firm. Then she added quickly, “We can take you to the cottage, if you’d like.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice smiled warmly at that, relief flickering in her eyes. “Thanks. I appreciate that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Wanda asked Alice how her flight had been, Agatha stood quietly, her mind racing—not because she was upset Rio hadn’t told her, but because suddenly, all she could think about was how she wanted to make tomorrow special too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio might not like to celebrate—but maybe it was time she learned how it felt to be truly cherished.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time they reached the cottage, the December sky had already started turning dusky gold, that soft burnished light that always made the woods behind Rio’s place feel a little enchanted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice followed a few steps behind Agatha and Wanda, bundled in a scarf and carrying a box of Rio’s favorite pastries from the Hollow. She looked like she was vibrating with excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, on the other hand, was quiet. Processing. The revelation that it was Rio’s birthday tomorrow had caught her off guard—but in the kind of way that stirred something warm and protective in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda had been smug the whole walk over. “You’re thinking about doing something, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had only lifted an eyebrow. “She didn’t even tell me. She clearly didn’t want to make a thing out of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly why you should.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stepped up to the front porch and Wanda gave the door a sharp little knock.</span>
</p><p>
<span>From inside, Salem let out an offended yowl—probably having been disturbed from his very important nap—and Rio’s muffled voice called, “Hang on!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door creaked open a few seconds later.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood there in thick socks and leggings, an old sweater hanging off her shoulder. A pencil was stuck in her messy bun, and she had a half-full mug of coffee in hand. She looked relaxed, maybe even happy—until she noticed the unexpected third person standing just behind Agatha and Wanda.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes widened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice lit up. “Hey, stranger.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze, mouth falling open, before setting her coffee down on the windowsill and practically tackling Alice in a hug. “Oh my god! What are you doing here? How are you here?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice laughed as Rio squeezed her. “Surprising you for your birthday, obviously.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You flew across the country?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, yeah.” Alice pulled back just enough to look at her. “Did you really think I wouldn’t show up for your birthday just because you decided to move to the other end of the universe?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flushed, still clearly overwhelmed. “I—no, I just—you know I don’t really do the whole birthday thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped in then, quieter but close. “You didn’t tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio met her eyes, a soft kind of guilt brushing over her features. “It’s not you. I just don’t like the fuss. It never really meant anything growing up, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly. “It means something now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face flickered—an emotion she tried to tamp down—and then she looked back at Alice. “How did you even find this place?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ran into these two when I stopped to ask for directions at a diner. They recognized me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, still a little stunned, still holding Alice’s arm like she couldn’t quite believe she was real. “I can’t believe you’re really here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You love it,” Alice said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced at Agatha again, then back at the three of them on her doorstep. Her voice dropped a little. “Yeah. I really do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now,” said Wanda, ushering them all forward, “let’s get inside before I freeze to death. I can’t feel my damn nose.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come in, come in,” Rio said, opening the door wider. “God, this is insane.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha caught her hand as she passed, gave it a squeeze. “Just wait until tomorrow, birthday girl.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio narrowed her eyes at her. “Don’t you start.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she was smiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha couldn’t look away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once everyone had stepped inside, shaking off the cold and shedding coats, scarves, and boots, Rio turned toward Alice, gesturing toward the couch. “Make yourself at home. There’s coffee if you want some—though I make no promises about the strength.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then her eyes found Agatha’s. Something shifted in her expression—softened. She took a quiet step closer and touched Agatha’s wrist gently. “Hey,” she said, her voice lower now, just for her. “You didn’t even get a proper hello.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled faintly, leaning in without hesitation. “I noticed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio brushed her fingers down Agatha’s arm, then slid them around her waist, pulling her in. “Thank you,” she murmured, voice just above a whisper. “For bringing her. For being here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her chin and leaned in, her lips finding Rio’s with practiced ease—warm and slow and grounding. A kiss that said: I’ve got you. I’m here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio melted into it for a breath, then pulled back with a contented sigh. Agatha tucked a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. “I knew you’d be happy to see your best friend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, a little dazed still, the adrenaline of surprise giving way to something more content. “You were right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>From the living room, Alice called, “Are you two going to keep making out in the entryway or should we just9 pretend not to notice?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned. “God, she’s going to be impossible now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m already impossible,” Alice replied, grinning from the couch. “Now I’m just winning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, kissed Rio’s cheek one more time, and stepped back. “Come on, birthday girl. Let’s show your best friend what Thistle Grove hospitality really looks like.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grabbed the pastry box Alice had brought and made a face. “This smells suspiciously like my favorite lemon tarts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is your favorite lemon tarts,” Alice said. “Because I love you and also because I bribed the woman at the Hollow with way too much cash to make extra just for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “I might cry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re allowed. It’s your birthday weekend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio set the box down on the coffee table and threw a cushion at her. “Traitor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice caught it and flopped back dramatically. “Guilty as charged.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha settled beside Rio, their knees touching, the warmth between them solid and sure. Wanda emerged from the kitchen holding a mug of coffee and a handful of cookies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Outside, the sky had turned to deep indigo. Inside, the lights were soft, the laughter easy, the walls holding onto the magic of love, friendship, and something beginning to feel like family.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And for once, Rio didn’t feel like hiding from her birthday.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The scent of lemon tarts and roasted coffee clung to the warm air inside the cottage, curling around Agatha like a shawl. She sipped from her mug as she watched Rio and Alice move around each other with the ease of old friendship—half snark, half secret language. Wanda had made herself at home on the floor, as usual, nursing a cup of something with an herbal bite.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, tucked into the corner of the couch with her legs folded beneath her, wasn’t used to being surrounded like this. It should have made her restless. Instead, she found herself almost… content.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice was thumbing through Rio’s sketchbook, pausing to study panels and flip back occasionally, clearly impressed. “These are so good,” she said, mouth full of tart. “Like—you’ve gotta be halfway through the next book already.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Halfway through the outline,” Rio said, perched on the armrest right beside Agatha. “Not the same thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s being modest,” Agatha said with a small, amused smile. “I’ve seen some of her boards and they’re amazing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I see it?” Alice asked, bright-eyed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, not yet” Rio said, apologetically. “Private. Agatha’s only seen them cause they’re in my room.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rude.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Artist boundaries,” she said with a smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nudged Rio’s hip lightly, just to feel her warmth. It still surprised her—how easily affection seemed to slip between them now. She didn’t take it for granted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A sharp mrow turned all their heads. Salem had emerged from wherever he’d been hiding, his sleek gray form winding through the shadows until he paused at the edge of the rug, glaring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow. “Dramatic entrance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned toward her and whispered, “He’s still mad we kicked him off the couch the other night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda coughed pointedly into her mug, hiding a laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Salem approached Alice like a tiny god assessing a mortal. She held still, brow lifted, and only moved when he—unexpectedly—leapt up and claimed her lap with casual arrogance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, hello to you too,” she murmured, scratching behind his ears. “Is he always this forward?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He usually shies away from strangers,” Rio commented, surprised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice grinned. “I have a very approachable aura.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Salem sat smugly for a moment longer before hopping down and marching over to Agatha, flopping bonelessly at her feet like a child proving a point.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s got a flair for the dramatic,” Alice said. “I respect it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice flopped dramatically across the cushions. “God, I missed you. You better believe we’re doing something tomorrow for your birthday, Vidal. Thistle Grove better have cake or sparklers or something witchy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart skipped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Witchy,” Alice clarified quickly. “You know. The vibe. Candles. Mystical fog. Old women who can tell your whole future by the state of your boots.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda snorted into her cup.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nearly choked on her drink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha covered a smile with her hand and shot Wanda a look: say nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Salem gave an imperious sniff.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice leaned back, petting him again. “Your cat definitely judges people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He judges everyone,” Rio laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand found Rio’s again, fingers twining lazily. The room hummed with warmth and firelight, and though her magic was quiet, it pulsed under her skin, content. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced sideways, giving her a small, quiet smile meant only for her. Agatha leaned in and kissed her temple, and Rio whispered something too low for anyone else to hear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for not making a big deal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha brushed a thumb over her knuckles. “Too late.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda had gone home a little while ago, and Alice had started yawning so frequently it was almost musical. The cottage had settled into a cozy stillness, the kind that made Agatha want to curl up in front of the fire with Rio and forget the outside world existed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should probably crash,” Alice said, rubbing her eyes. “Need my full energy to harass Rio properly tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted. “You’ve never needed energy for that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“True,” Alice said, stretching. “So—couch?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced toward it and winced. “Yeah. Unless you want to risk your life with the floor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The couch is fine,” Alice said, already digging through her bag for her toothbrush.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as she disappeared into the bathroom, Agatha turned to Rio with a raised eyebrow. “Are you going to let your best friend sleep on that rock masquerading as furniture?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned. “I was going to try to make it better? I saw a couple of handy spells in the grimoire. But I don’t want her to notice anything. The outside of the couch has to stay exactly the same.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped in closer, voice quiet and warm. “Then that’s the spell. Transformation on the inside, illusion on the outside. You can do it. I’ll help.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, looking from Agatha to the couch like it might bite her. “What if I mess it up? What if it explodes? Or folds in on itself? Or starts talking?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It won’t,” Agatha said with a soft laugh. “You’re getting better every day, and you already have the intent—comfort, safety, subtlety. That’s half the spell right there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled, steadying herself. “Okay. Let’s do this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped forward, placing her hands on the back cushions. Her voice was barely a whisper as she spoke the incantation. There was a slight hum in the air, a faint shimmer only a witch would see, and then—the cushions plumped, the interior support shifted, and the couch sighed into a deep, warm, cushy comfort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On the outside, it remained exactly as it had before—well-worn but intact, a humble piece of furniture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “Did it work?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha walked over, pressed a hand to the back, then sat—sinking into the plush, transformed inside. “Oh yes. She’s going to think you’ve had this cozy couch all along.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, her pride blooming beneath the nerves. “Damn. I actually did it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did,” Agatha said, eyes bright. “And it’s perfect.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, babe,” Rio said automatically, still smiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stilled. “Did you just call me babe?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze. “No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” Rio muttered, eyes warm with quiet affection. “Maybe I did. So?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned in, lips brushing her cheek. “I like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could kiss her properly, Alice stepped out of the bathroom, towel-drying her hands. “Whoa. That couch looks—shockingly decent. Did I just not sit on it properly before?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Rio shared a brief, silent look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Must’ve been the angle,” Rio said quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice shrugged and flopped down. “Well, I call dibs on this spot for life. Night, ladies. And Salem, wherever you are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Salem blinked lazily from under a chair, his tail flicking like he was considering a response.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Night, Alice,” Rio said, still softly grinning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they slipped into the bedroom a few minutes later, Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio from behind and murmured against her ear, “You’re more powerful than you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head toward her. “I’ve got a pretty great teacher.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kissed the curve of her neck. “You’ve got a good heart. The magic just follows.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned, eyes shadowed with flickers of worry that hadn’t quite faded, but there was something else now, something stronger—certainty, longing, the quiet promise of trust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached for her without a word, tucking a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear before drawing her in. Their mouths met slowly, reverently, like they had all the time in the world. There was no rush, no hunger too sharp. Just this: the gentle heat between them, the soft exhale of relief at being alone again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands settled at Agatha’s waist, tugging her closer, and Agatha let herself be guided back toward the bed. The mattress dipped beneath them, and everything outside the circle of their bodies melted away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed kisses down the line of Rio’s jaw, over the curve of her throat, feeling every hitch in her breath like a secret shared. She moved with care, reverence, not because Rio was fragile—but because she was precious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did so well today,” she whispered as she ran her fingers over Rio’s ribs, the quiet thrum of magic still lingering beneath her skin. “You were amazing. And brilliant. And mine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers curled into Agatha’s shirt, her voice suddenly tight from the praise. “You’re going to make me cry, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me make you feel cherished instead,” Agatha said, kissing her softly again, again, until Rio melted into her with a sigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Clothes were shed in slow touches, warm and unhurried, until there was nothing left between them but skin and honesty. Agatha made love to her with a quiet fierceness, like she could imprint the truth into Rio’s body: you’re not alone anymore. You are known. You are safe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And when Rio whispered her name—low and reverent, the sound trembling at the edge of a moan—Agatha thought, this is what it means to belong.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They moved together in sync, wrapped in starlight and soft breaths, and when Rio finally came apart beneath her, Agatha held her through every wave, murmuring her name like a spell, like a vow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After, when the world had settled again, they lay tangled together in the sheets, heartbeats slowing, breath steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand brushed over Agatha’s stomach in lazy patterns. “I still can’t believe Alice is here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed, pressing a kiss to her temple. “She’s good for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So are you,” Rio said, voice drowsy but sure. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t say anything—just held her tighter, lips curving into the barest of smiles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Saturday would bring surprises. Celebrations. Maybe even trouble.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But for now, in this sliver of quiet night, they had each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that was enough.</span>
</p><p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio woke slowly, the weight of sleep still heavy on her limbs, and a strange warmth curling in her chest.</p><p>She’d been dreaming again.</p><p>This one had the same quality as the others—half dream, half memory, soft around the edges but vivid enough to leave a mark. Snow fell gently in the forest behind the cottage, blanketing the trees in a quiet hush. Someone had strung little glass lanterns between the branches, and a table had been set beneath the shelter of an old pine, tucked in close to the trunk where the snow didn’t reach.</p><p>A birthday cake sat at the center, white frosting with sugared cranberries on top, flickering candles struggling to stay lit in the cold. She’d been small again, bundled in a knit scarf and red mittens, cheeks flushed from the cold. Laughter rang through the trees—hers, bright and unburdened. There were voices she didn’t quite recognize, soft and kind, singing a lullaby that twisted into something familiar. Something warm.</p><p>She couldn’t remember who held her hand, but she remembered the feeling.</p><p>Loved. Wanted.</p><p>She opened her eyes slowly. The bedroom was quiet except for the sound of Agatha breathing beside her. The witch hadn’t stirred yet, still wrapped in sleep, her hair fanned across the pillow like ink spilled in water.</p><p>Rio turned toward her, nestling in closer, and pressed a kiss just beneath her jaw. “Hey,” she whispered. “You awake?”</p><p>“Mmm. Wasn’t,” Agatha murmured, voice still low with sleep. “But I’m not complaining.”</p><p>“I had another one,” Rio said, voice barely above a whisper. “A dream, but… it felt real. Like a memory again.”</p><p>That got Agatha’s attention. Her eyes opened slowly, and she reached for Rio, tucking her close. “Tell me.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, replaying the details. “It was winter. Snow everywhere. But I wasn’t cold. There were lanterns in the trees and… a little table under a pine. A birthday cake. I was just a kid. Someone sang to me. I don’t know who.”</p><p>Agatha ran her hand down Rio’s back in long, slow strokes. “Do you remember the song?”</p><p>“Bits of it. Like a lullaby. But it wasn’t sad. It felt… like I mattered. Like someone really wanted me to have a good birthday.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled quietly. “I wonder if that’s an actual memory.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, her throat tight. “It can’t be. I never celebrated growing up. Birthdays were just another day in the system. But this dream—it felt like the kind of memory I should have had.”</p><p>Agatha pressed a kiss to her forehead. “Then maybe it’s your legacy catching up to you. Telling you that you’re home now. That it’s safe to feel joy, too.”</p><p>Rio smiled softly. “You’re kind of good at this, you know.”</p><p>“At what?”</p><p>“This… comforting thing.”</p><p>“I’ve had practice,” Agatha murmured, pulling her a little closer. “And I happen to care about you a lot, baby.”</p><p>Rio stilled slightly, then laughed under her breath. “Still not over you calling me baby.”</p><p>Agatha grinned against her skin. “Get used to it.”</p><p>And for once, Rio thought maybe she could.</p><p>~*~</p><p>They didn’t get up right away. Instead, they stayed in that suspended state between awake and asleep, just enjoying the closeness.</p><p>The morning light filtered in through the curtains, pale and golden, catching on the edge of the dresser and the folds of the quilt tossed halfway off the bed. The room smelled like cedar and lavender and a little like sleep. Warm, slow, peaceful.</p><p>Agatha was curled around her, one arm draped over Rio’s waist, her breath soft against Rio’s hair. She hadn’t moved much, just shifted slightly when Rio stirred, and now she was watching her with those sharp, beautiful eyes that somehow always looked softer first thing in the morning.</p><p>Rio blinked up at her. “You’re staring.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “I like the view.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but her mouth tugged into a smile anyway. She tucked herself in closer, nuzzling her face against Agatha’s neck. “So unfair. It’s too early to be charming.”</p><p>“And yet here I am,” Agatha murmured, brushing her fingers lightly over Rio’s cheek. “Thirty-five looks good on you.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Ugh, it was supposed to be just a regular day.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a breath of amusement. “Your best friend flew across the country to surprise you. Kind of hard to miss.”</p><p>“Alice,” Rio groaned into Agatha’s skin. “You know, I should’ve known she’d pull something like this.”</p><p>“She’s wonderful,” Agatha said, her voice gentler now. “But right now I only want to think about you.”</p><p>That made something flutter in Rio’s chest—something warm and careful and maybe just a little terrifying. She didn’t answer right away. Just let herself breathe, pressed against the warmth of Agatha’s skin, her heartbeat a steady thrum beneath her ear.</p><p>“I never liked birthdays,” she admitted after a moment. “They always felt… weird. Like I was supposed to feel happy. Grateful. Special. But mostly I just felt like a mistake someone got rid of”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything, just ran a soothing hand down her spine.</p><p>“I didn’t even tell Alice for the first couple of years,” Rio added. “She only figured it out when she saw my ID.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in and kissed her forehead. “Then let’s not celebrate it the way other people do. Let’s make it yours. Just yours.”</p><p>Rio looked up at her, heart thudding quietly in her chest. “You really are amazing, you know that?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “I’ve heard.”</p><p>Rio laughed—really laughed, the sound bubbling up and catching even her by surprise. She leaned up and kissed Agatha, soft and slow, like a thank you she didn’t know how to say. Agatha kissed her back just as gently, one hand cradling her jaw, thumb brushing the corner of her mouth.</p><p>There wasn’t heat in the kiss, not this time. Not urgency. Just something quiet and whole and a little bit dizzying. Something that said: I see you. And I’m not going anywhere.</p><p>They didn’t say anything after that. There was no need. Everything that mattered was there between them—in the brush of fingers, in the warmth of shared breath, in the way Agatha looked at her like she was something precious.</p><p>Rio didn’t say it out loud, but she felt it.</p><p>She was in love with her.</p><p>And maybe that was the real gift today.</p><p>~*~</p><p>They finally peeled themselves out of bed for a shower—though “quick” might’ve been generous. Between Agatha’s wandering hands and Rio’s inability to stop smiling whenever their eyes met, it took way longer than it should have. But eventually they made it downstairs, hair still damp, hands brushing occasionally as they walked side by side into the kitchen.</p><p>And there, like some strange and wonderful domestic dream, stood Alice wearing an oversized flannel shirt, flipping pancakes like she owned the place.</p><p>“Morning, birthday girl!” Alice said, bright and smug, not even looking up as she flipped one with casual expertise. “Sit. I’m making your favorites.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “You’re making pancakes?”</p><p>Alice turned and raised a brow. “Excuse me, I’m making the pancakes. Plus scrambled eggs, that weird breakfast hash you like, and I may have found an unopened jar of Nutella in your cabinet and I’m not above using it.”</p><p>Agatha gave Rio a sidelong look, her mouth twitching. “She’s very efficient.”</p><p>“You have no idea,” Rio muttered, heart full and aching all at once.</p><p>Alice finally looked over at them properly, her eyes softening for just a second. “Happy birthday, Rio.”</p><p>Rio walked over and wrapped her in a tight hug. “You’re a menace, you know that?”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Alice said, hugging her back. “You’re welcome.”</p><p>Agatha hovered in the doorway for a beat longer, watching them. Then she quietly crossed over to the coffee pot, giving them the moment. When Rio glanced back, she caught Agatha smiling into her mug, her eyes warm, her posture relaxed.</p><p>This felt… real.</p><p>Homey. Safe. Hers.</p><p>And maybe—just maybe—for the first time in her life, Rio didn’t want to run from her birthday.</p><p>She wanted to stay.</p><p>~*~</p><p>After a breakfast filled with teasing and college stories from Alice that made Rio want to curl up and die of embarrassment, her best friend finally stood and stretched. </p><p>“Okay. I’m gonna go take a quick shower so I can be cute for this charming small-town festival thing you people do.”</p><p>“You’re adorable already,” Rio called after her, grinning.</p><p>Once Alice disappeared up the stairs, silence settled in. A warm, golden sort of quiet. Agatha slid her chair closer and tucked a piece of hair behind Rio’s ear.</p><p>“Happy birthday, darling,” she murmured, her gaze full of something that made Rio’s breath catch. “You look radiant today.”</p><p>Rio felt heat rise to her cheeks. “Stop.”</p><p>“I haven’t even started.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in then, slow and deliberate, her lips brushing over Rio’s in a kiss that started soft—just a press of mouths, a breath shared—but deepened as Rio leaned into it. Her fingers curled into the loose fabric of Agatha’s shirt, pulling her closer.</p><p>Every touch from Agatha felt like sunlight. Like something blooming just beneath Rio’s skin. And as their mouths moved together, slow and lazy and unhurried, she felt it—the soft buzz of something waking up.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, the tiny pot of herbs on the windowsill had burst into bloom. Petals unfurling, buds yawning open like they, too, were leaning into the joy swelling in her chest.</p><p>Agatha followed her gaze and let out a quiet, delighted laugh. “You’re doing it again.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio whispered, a little breathless, forehead resting against Agatha’s. “I can’t help it. I’m just… happy.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her again, slower this time, as if sealing something unspoken between them. Not quite I love you, but something close. Something just as deep.</p><p>Agatha kissed her again—deeper this time, more lingering. Rio tilted her head, chasing the warmth of it, her hands sliding up to cradle Agatha’s jaw. She felt the magic bloom beneath her skin like heat rising from a sun-warmed stone, spilling out of her in quiet waves. There was no pulling it back.</p><p>On the kitchen table, a few more flowers blossomed—wild and bright and entirely out of season. A tiny golden daisy peeked up beside the salt shaker, a pale violet unfurling just next to the butter dish. Agatha pulled back slightly, eyes sparkling as she reached for one.</p><p>“Well, would you look at that,” she murmured, twirling the delicate stem between her fingers before holding it out toward Rio with an exaggerated flourish. “Happy birthday, my lady.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help herself—she kissed her again, giddy and smiling against Agatha’s mouth, laughing into the press of it. Her arms wrapped around Agatha’s waist, pulling her closer until they were both flush against the table, and the only thing Rio could think about was how damn good it felt to be wanted like this. To be known and still adored.</p><p>That was precisely the moment Alice walked into the kitchen again, towel around her neck, eyebrows raised—and then immediately dropped her hand over her eyes.</p><p>“I literally just left the room not even five minutes ago,” she said, voice dry. “I haven’t even showered yet and you’re already making out in front of the condiments.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly and stepped back, brushing a piece of hair from Rio’s face. Rio turned toward her best friend, cheeks flushed and grinning.</p><p>Alice peeked through her fingers. “Is it safe?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said brightly, reaching for her coffee. “But come in anyway. You’re the one who invaded my cottage.”</p><p>“Rude,” Alice muttered, flopping into a chair. “Next time I surprise you for your birthday, I expect less tongue and more balloons.”</p><p>“You’re getting pancakes,” Rio said. “That’s festive enough.”</p><p>Alice sighed like a martyr and picked up her fork. “I made the pancakes, don’t you forget it.”</p><p>Agatha caught Rio’s gaze from across the table and smiled again—soft and knowing and utterly spellbound. Rio felt that smile in her chest, like the sunlight was blooming there too.</p><p>And for the first time in a long time, she didn’t feel like she was missing anything.</p><p>~*~</p><p>After breakfast, the cottage slowly hummed to life with that soft, golden kind of excitement that only came with special days—warm clothes being pulled from closets, coffee mugs refilled, a soft playlist Rio had thrown on from her phone drifting through the speakers.</p><p>Upstairs, Rio stood in her room, holding up two different sweaters like the fate of the day depended on it. Agatha leaned against the doorway, arms folded, watching her with a quiet fondness that made Rio’s chest ache in the best way.</p><p>“You look beautiful in both,” Agatha said, voice low, her smile curved and slow. “But the dark green one brings out the mischief in your eyes.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but grinned. “You’re ridiculous.”</p><p>“And you’re blushing.” Agatha crossed the room and pressed a kiss to Rio’s cheek, then one to the corner of her mouth. “I need to run back to my place real quick, grab a change of clothes and feed Scratchy. I’ll meet you at The Hollow in an hour?”</p><p>Rio nodded, her smile lingering. “Sounds good. Alice’ll want to poke around town a bit anyway.”</p><p>Agatha paused by the door, fingers trailing along the frame. Then she turned back, her expression softening.</p><p>“Before you go…” she said. “You should take a moment to write that dream down in the grimoire. The one you had this morning.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head slightly. “You think it’s important?”</p><p>“I do,” Agatha said gently. “The way you described it… how real it felt? That’s not something to ignore. Dreams like that—when magic brushes up against memory—it’s how the truth starts to unravel. You’ll want a record of it.”</p><p>Rio glanced toward her nightstand where the grimoire rested, quiet and waiting.</p><p>“I will,” she said. “Promise.”</p><p>Agatha stepped back into the room and kissed her one more time—slow, deliberate, thumb brushing the corner of Rio’s mouth.</p><p>“Happy birthday,” she whispered. “Again.”</p><p>Then she was gone in a rustle of coat and perfume and that little smile she always left behind, like a bookmark in Rio’s soul.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio stood by her bedroom window for a long moment after Agatha left, watching the trees sway in the cold breeze. The sunlight broke through the thinning clouds and lit the cottage’s old wooden floor in gold. Her hand brushed absently over the spot on her cheek where Agatha had kissed her. She smiled to herself.</p><p>Then she turned and walked over to her nightstand.</p><p>The grimoire felt heavy in her hands—more than just its leather-bound weight. It felt like legacy. Like truth. She opened it to the next blank page, the scent of old paper and dried herbs rising up to meet her.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged on her bed, Rio took a breath, then picked up her pen.</p><p>
<i>December 6th. Early morning.</i>
</p><p>Another dream—or maybe a memory. It felt… real. More than real. A birthday party. The kind I never had as a kid. There was warmth, laughter, cake with honey-sweet frosting, and people who looked at me like they loved me. There was music, too—strings and humming and a voice I couldn’t quite place singing my name like it was something sacred.</p><p>I woke up happy. I felt safe. I can still hear the breeze through the trees, the sound of someone laughing from across the table. I don’t know what it means. But I know I want to remember it.</p><p>She stared at the ink for a moment before adding, in smaller letters:</p><p>
<i>Thank you, whoever you were.</i>
</p><p>Closing the book, she pressed her hand to its cover and let it rest there for a few beats before getting up to finish getting ready.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The bell above The Hollow’s front door jingled as Rio and Alice stepped inside, and Rio instantly breathed in the warm, spicy air—cinnamon, cloves, and something a little harder to name. Comfort, maybe. Magic disguised as memory.</p><p>Agatha was already there, seated near the window with Wanda, a half-finished mug of tea between her hands. The moment Rio spotted her, something inside her clicked into place, like her day had just officially begun. Agatha looked up, smiled, and Rio felt her stomach flutter—ridiculous, considering how much time they’d been spending together lately, how thoroughly Agatha had wormed her way into her every thought.</p><p>“There they are,” Agatha said, rising as they crossed the room.</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. She leaned in and kissed her—quick but warm, the kind of kiss that said I missed you, even though it had only been an hour or two. Agatha’s hand found hers under the table as they both sat, their fingers lacing together naturally.</p><p>“I’m just saying,” Alice announced, tugging off her coat, “this place smells like magic and baked goods had a love child.”</p><p>Rio caught Agatha watching her, that same quiet, tender intensity that always made her feel like she was glowing from the inside out. The memory of that kitchen kiss earlier—the flower blooming in Agatha’s fingers, the way she’d said happy birthday, my lady—played on repeat behind her eyes.</p><p>“You okay?” Agatha whispered, close enough that Rio felt the brush of her breath.</p><p>Rio nodded. “I’m more than okay.”</p><p>She wasn’t lying. Her heart was still humming from the way the morning had unfolded—waking up wrapped in Agatha’s arms, the warm bubble of domestic bliss with Alice clanging around the kitchen, and the overwhelming contentment that had settled into her bones like sunlight.</p><p>“Good,” Agatha murmured, brushing her thumb along the back of Rio’s hand.</p><p>“You two are nauseating,” Alice said, biting into a scone. “Like, I get it now, but still.”</p><p>Rio laughed and squeezed Agatha’s hand. “I‘ll take that as a compliment.”</p><p>Outside, the square was starting to buzz. She could see pops of color through the window—festival booths going up, a kid dragging a red balloon, strings of lights being strung from lamppost to lamppost. The town felt alive in a way she hadn’t fully appreciated until now.</p><p>“So,” Wanda said, resting her chin on her palm with a knowing smirk, “thirty-five. How’s it feel?”</p><p>Rio groaned and let her head drop dramatically onto Agatha’s shoulder. “It feels like betrayal. I told you all that in confidence.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her temple and murmured, “You wear it well.”</p><p>“You’re all so annoying,” Rio mumbled, but she was smiling as she said it.</p><p>And when Agatha tilted her head just enough to meet her gaze, Rio couldn’t help it—she leaned in for another kiss. A soft one. Meaningful. The kind that carried unspoken things.</p><p>Things they weren’t saying yet.</p><p>Things they were both starting to feel.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio was halfway through a buttery scone and trying to decide if she had room for another when the front door burst open with a jingle and a dramatic gust of cold air. A streak of black eyeliner, oversized boots, and chaotic energy came bounding in.</p><p>“Is she here?” Billy’s voice rang through the café. “Tell me she’s here.”</p><p>Lilia peered out from behind the counter with a raised brow. “You’re blowing in like a storm, child.”</p><p>“I am a storm,” Billy replied dramatically, and then his eyes landed on Rio. “There she is!”</p><p>He bounded across the room and flung himself into a hug so fast, Rio had barely set her tea down before he wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>“Oh—hi?” she managed, startled but smiling. “Wow, okay, we’re hugging. This is happening.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, but it’s not every day your actual favorite graphic novelist moves into town and turns out to be besties with your godmother and maybe-sort-of-dating her too,” Billy said, pulling back with a grin. “Happy birthday, Rio Vidal. I brought you a present.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “You—what?”</p><p>Billy reached into his coat and pulled out a little box, tied with twine. “I made it myself. No pressure, but if you don’t like it, I’ll die.”</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet laugh, sipping her tea like this was just another regular afternoon.</p><p>Rio took the box and opened it slowly, revealing a tiny, hand-carved wood charm in the shape of a pen—no, wait, a fountain pen with vines curling around it. There were little inky details etched into the handle. It was delicate and full of character, the kind of thing that looked like it belonged in a story.</p><p>“This is… Billy, this is amazing,” she said, genuinely touched. “Thank you.”</p><p>Billy beamed. “It’s enchanted to keep your creativity flowing.”</p><p>Alice, who had just taken a sip of her tea, immediately choked.</p><p>Wanda coughed into her mug. Agatha gently elbowed Billy, who blinked like a deer in headlights.</p><p>“I—uh. I mean, not actually enchanted,” Billy said quickly, shooting Alice a glance. “Obviously. That would be weird. Haha. Magic’s not real. Who said that? Ha.”</p><p>Alice narrowed her eyes, suspicious. “Did… did you just say it’s enchanted?”</p><p>“No. Definitely didn’t,” Billy said too fast.</p><p>Rio snorted into her tea. Agatha was biting her lip, and even Wanda was trying very hard not to smile.</p><p>Alice pointed a finger at Rio. “I swear, if you all turn out to be in some weird cottagecore cult—”</p><p>“Oh, we are,” Wanda said sweetly. “We even have themed scones.”</p><p>Rio was laughing so hard she had to wipe a tear from her eye. Agatha looked over at her with that familiar fondness, and Rio felt a warm rush bloom inside her. Not the kind of magic she still didn’t fully understand—but something just as powerful. Joy. Belonging. Love, even if they hadn’t said it yet.</p><p>Billy flopped dramatically into a chair beside them. “I’m staying for scones.”</p><p>Lilia slid another plate onto the table with a wink. “You always are, dear.”</p><p>And just like that, Rio let herself lean back into Agatha’s side, sipping her tea and letting the laughter buzz around her like electricity. For the first time in a long time, her birthday didn’t feel like something she had to survive.</p><p>It felt like magic. The kind she could believe in.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The Thistle Grove town festival was already in full swing by the time Rio, Agatha, Wanda, and Alice made their way to the town square.</p><p>String lights crisscrossed overhead like constellations in the twilight sky, and the air smelled like cinnamon, roasting nuts, and woodsmoke. Children darted past with caramel apples and glittering fairy wings, a live band played near the gazebo, and vendors lined the street offering everything from wool scarves to homemade cider.</p><p>“Okay, this place is straight out of a Hallmark movie,” Alice said, wide-eyed as she took in the scene. “I half-expect a sleigh to roll up and someone to spontaneously propose.”</p><p>“That usually happens closer to Christmas,” Agatha quipped from beside her, the ghost of a smirk on her lips.</p><p>Rio chuckled and looped her arm through Alice’s. “Come on, let me show you the best cider stand. Lilia says the guy who runs it talks to his apples before he picks them, and honestly? It shows.”</p><p>As the two of them wandered, Rio pointed out all her favorite shops—The Hollow, of course, and the tiny antique bookstore tucked next to the flower shop where she once spotted a black cat curled up on a stack of poetry volumes. Alice listened intently, throwing in her usual sarcasm and playful jabs, but Rio could tell she was charmed.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder now and then, catching glimpses of Agatha and Wanda a little ways behind them, deep in quiet conversation as they moved through the crowd. Agatha’s coat was dark against the golden lights, her face still, eyes sharp and scanning. Rio’s heart pulled a little tighter at the sight.</p><p>It was comforting, somehow—knowing Agatha was always watching.</p><p>They were passing a row of booths when Rio felt it—a strange hum beneath her skin. Not quite danger. Not quite anything, really. Just a flicker. Her steps slowed.</p><p>Alice noticed. “You okay?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said quickly, brushing it off. “Just… the cobblestones are uneven.”</p><p>But the feeling didn’t leave. She glanced back again—and saw Agatha now with Wanda’s hand lightly on her arm, both of them still, looking across the square.</p><p>Rio followed their gaze.</p><p>There, near the corner where two side streets met, a man in a slate-gray coat stood facing a vendor cart. Nothing about him was particularly memorable, but Wanda’s expression had sharpened and Agatha’s eyes had narrowed ever so slightly.</p><p>“Who’s that?” Rio murmured when Agatha finally reached her side again.</p><p>Agatha shook her head once. “Don’t know yet.”</p><p>“Nothing to panic about,” Wanda added lightly as she joined them, offering a small smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Just… something to file away. He passed by earlier and I got a weird magic vibe from him.”</p><p>Rio felt that same flicker of unease again, just stronger now. She glanced at Alice, who was sipping cider and totally unaware. That protective instinct roared up in her like a sudden wave.</p><p>But Agatha was already there beside her, voice soft and low, meant only for Rio’s ears. “We’ll keep an eye out. Nothing happens to you on my watch. Okay?”</p><p>Rio met her eyes, the warmth of that promise anchoring her in place. “Okay.”</p><p>And just like that, the moment passed. The band picked up a new song, and a few townsfolk started dancing near the square. Alice nudged Rio’s side.</p><p>“Alright, this cider is life-changing,” she declared. “Now show me where the pies are.”</p><p>Rio laughed again, the tension easing slightly, and as they moved toward the bakery stand, Agatha’s hand brushed against hers. She didn’t say anything—but she didn’t have to.</p><p>There was something unspoken humming between them. Not just magic.</p><p>Trust.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur of music, laughter, and the scent of freshly baked everything. Rio couldn’t remember the last time she’d felt this… full. Not in the overeating sense, though Alice had insisted on trying a bite of every pastry Thistle Grove had to offer. But full in the quiet, soul-deep way. Like maybe this strange little town had carved out a space just for her.</p><p>Alice was currently winning an arm-wrestling contest with an unsuspecting teenager at the apple-pressing booth—cheered on by a small crowd. Rio leaned against a wooden post by the cider stand, sipping a warm cup of the spiced stuff, when she felt Agatha step in close behind her.</p><p>“She’s thriving,” Agatha murmured, nodding toward Alice as the teen groaned in defeat and dramatically collapsed onto the table.</p><p>Rio grinned. “She’s in her element. Chaos and carbs.”</p><p>Agatha hummed in agreement and reached around Rio’s waist to steal a sip of her cider. Her other hand brushed against Rio’s back, grounding and gentle.</p><p>For a while, they stood in companionable silence, watching children dart between booths, old friends embrace, and the town square glow with a kind of joy that felt rare and untouched. Every so often, Rio could feel Agatha’s gaze flick to that same corner of the square where the gray-coated man had stood. But he hadn’t returned. And Rio found herself relaxing, if only a little.</p><p>“Thank you,” she said quietly, turning just enough to see Agatha’s profile. “For… everything.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her. “I haven’t done that much.”</p><p>“You showed up,” Rio said simply. “And you stayed.”</p><p>That earned her a look. Soft. Meaningful. And not a little devastating.</p><p>“You deserve people who stay, Rio.”</p><p>Her throat caught. Before she could say something dumb or start crying right next to the fudge booth, Agatha leaned in and kissed her temple.</p><p>“You ready to head back soon?” Agatha murmured against her skin. </p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah. I think I’m done peopling for the day.”</p><p>Alice joined them not long after, still high on festival energy and clutching a bag of caramel popcorn. “Okay, I’m officially obsessed with this town. Let’s move here. Let’s start a commune. I’ll bring the sarcasm.”</p><p>“You already do,” Rio teased, slinging an arm around her.</p><p>They strolled home slowly, the streets of Thistle Grove gradually quieting as the festival wound down. Lanterns still glowed in shop windows, and couples walked hand in hand, bundled against the chill. It was the kind of evening that begged for something more—something tender and slow and lit only by firelight.</p><p>Back at the cottage, Alice collapsed onto the couch with a dramatic groan and promptly fell asleep halfway through a monologue about fudge.</p><p>Rio tucked a blanket over her, heart squeezing just a little.</p><p>She found Agatha in the kitchen, standing at the window with a mug in her hands, watching the stars begin to flicker to life above the treetops. The moonlight silvered the edges of her hair.</p><p>Rio stepped up behind her and wrapped her arms around her waist, pressing her cheek between her shoulder blades.</p><p>They didn’t speak. They didn’t need to.</p><p>And in that quiet moment, safe and warm and tucked into something that felt like love even if they hadn’t said the word, Rio knew:</p><p>This birthday was everything she never thought she’d have—and everything she was still afraid to hope for.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Sunday dawned silver and quiet, the kind of Maine morning where the fog drifted in like a dream and lingered well into breakfast. Rio stretched in bed, sore in all the best ways, then slipped into her robe and followed the scent of coffee down the stairs.</p><p>In the kitchen, Alice was already awake, flipping through one of Rio’s sketchbooks at the table, while Agatha stood at the stove, barefoot, hair tied back in a low bun as she stirred something in a cast-iron skillet.</p><p>“Good morning, sleepyhead,” Alice called. “Your kitchen goddess made pancakes. And also—I want to steal this page,” she added, waving a sketch of an eerie, flower-filled forest. “It’s gorgeous. New story?”</p><p>“Sort of,” Rio mumbled, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s cheek before sliding into the seat beside Alice.</p><p>Agatha glanced over her shoulder with a small, knowing smile. “We’re calling it a slow burn.”</p><p>They ate breakfast in easy conversation. Laughter slipped in naturally. Alice teased Rio. Rio teased back. Salem hopped up on the windowsill to soak in what little sun there was, casting the occasional judgmental glance toward Alice but otherwise behaving himself.</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>Alice stood to grab more syrup and accidentally knocked over Rio’s mug. Hot coffee sloshed across the table—straight toward one of Rio’s sketchbooks.</p><p>“No—!” Rio shouted, instinct kicking in hard. She flung out her hand, and—</p><p>The coffee stopped.</p><p>Frozen mid-spill, droplets hanging suspended in the air like tiny amber orbs, not a single page touched.</p><p>Alice stood there, still holding the syrup, eyes wide and unblinking. “What. The. Fuck.”</p><p>Agatha swore under her breath.</p><p>Rio’s heart thundered in her chest. She hadn’t meant to do it—it had just happened, instinctive and sharp and completely visible. Even Salem turned his head slowly toward her, as if to say nice going.</p><p>Alice dropped the syrup.</p><p>“You just did… something. That wasn’t gravity. Or reflexes. That was—what the hell was that, Rio?!”</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha. Agatha gave a tiny nod. No more hiding.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said softly, her voice unsteady but calm. “I can explain. But… you might want to sit down.”</p><p>Alice sat down slowly, as if afraid the chair might disappear beneath her. “You’re going to explain? Please do. Because my best friend just froze coffee midair like we’re in The Matrix, and I haven’t even finished my caffeine yet.”</p><p>Rio winced, then looked down at her hands. The coffee had settled neatly back into the mug without a splash, like it had never moved at all.</p><p>“Okay. So,” she started, then stopped. “You know, the cottage? The inheritance? The random letter from some lawyer’s office in the middle of nowhere?”</p><p>Alice nodded. “Yeah, and I remember telling you it was weird as fuck.”</p><p>“Right. Well, turns out it wasn’t random. Or fake. This cottage really did belong to my biological family. And…they were… witches. Like, real witches. And so am I, apparently.”</p><p>Alice blinked. “I’m sorry. What?”</p><p>Rio shrugged helplessly. “Yeah. That’s what I said too. At first, I thought I was losing my mind. Things started happening—lights flickering, plants growing faster than they should, dreams that felt like memories. Then I met Agatha—”</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha said, mildly, raising a hand from the kitchen.</p><p>Alice stared at her. “You’re a witch too?”</p><p>“Mm-hmm.”</p><p>“And you’ve both been doing actual magic this whole time?”</p><p>“Well,” Rio said, “not… a whole lot of it.”</p><p>“Except for the part where you just stopped time with a flick of your wrist!”</p><p>“That’s new,” Rio said quickly. “I didn’t even know I could do that. I wasn’t trying to do anything! I was just—protecting my sketchbook.”</p><p>Agatha crossed the room then, laying a hand gently on Rio’s back. “It’s your instincts. Your magic is growing—and fast. It’s responding to emotion, to need, maybe even to your environment.”</p><p>Alice gave a breathless laugh, somewhere between awe and disbelief. “You’re serious. This isn’t a prank. This is real?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t prank you with witchcraft,” Rio said, smiling faintly.</p><p>“Okay, I mean… fair.”</p><p>There was a long pause. Then Alice exhaled hard, rubbing her forehead. “So, what now? Do you like… have a wand? Are you going to Hogwarts next?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “I have a familiar and a cottage. That’s close enough, right?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly. “You have more than that. You have a coven. Even if you don’t know it yet.”</p><p>Alice looked between them, her expression slowly shifting from disbelief to something like wonder. “Holy shit. My best friend is a witch.”</p><p>Rio looked up at her. “Still want to stick around for a while?”</p><p>Alice gave her a lopsided smile. “Are you kidding? I want front row seats.”</p><p>Alice leaned forward, eyes gleaming. “Okay. Spill. Start from the top, and no skipping the juicy parts. Like, how exactly are you a witch? What can you even do?”</p><p>Rio rubbed the back of her neck, a wry smile tugging at her lips. “Honestly? I’m still figuring it out. But it’s… mostly tied to how I feel.”</p><p>Alice raised an eyebrow. “Meaning?”</p><p>“Meaning,” Rio said, gesturing vaguely, “if I’m happy, flowers bloom out of nowhere. I’m not kidding. Like—actual flowers. The kitchen table’s seen some things.”</p><p>Alice stared. “Wait, the bouquet I saw yesterday morning—”</p><p>“Yeah. That just sort of… happened.” Rio’s cheeks flushed. “Agatha says it’s part of my affinity. I make things grow. I can transform stuff too, but it’s still hard to control.”</p><p>“Transform stuff how?” Alice asked, eyes wide.</p><p>Rio hesitated, then laughed softly. “I turned my couch into a pullout bed. Agatha kind of… encouraged me to try it last night when you went to the bathroom.”</p><p>“You what?” Alice’s jaw dropped, then she looked toward the living room like she could see the magic lingering. “Okay, that’s actually super cool. But like—what happens if you’re upset?”</p><p>Rio’s expression shifted, more serious now. “It’s… not great. The night I found out about this whole thing, I caused a pretty bad thunderstorm.”</p><p>Alice blinked. “You made a storm?”</p><p>Rio shrugged helplessly. “Agatha thinks my emotions are a conduit. I’m learning to channel it, but it’s… intense.”</p><p>Alice leaned back, shaking her head. “Holy crap, Rio. You’re like a walking weather system with a garden subscription.”</p><p>That got a laugh out of Rio. “Not exactly what I was going for, but sure.”</p><p>Alice’s smile softened. “Okay, real talk—how are you doing with all this? Really?”</p><p>Rio looked down at her hands, then back up at her friend. “Scared. Excited. Overwhelmed. But also… like I’m finally part of something. Like there’s this part of me that’s always been there, waiting.”</p><p>Alice reached over and squeezed her hand. “I’m proud of you. Seriously. Magic or not, you’re still the same weird, brilliant nerd I’ve always loved.”</p><p>Rio smiled, heart full. “Thanks, Al.”</p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>
<span>Agatha hadn’t stopped watching Alice since the moment Rio finished telling her everything. She sat perched on the arm of the couch, her tea cooling in her hands, though she hadn’t taken a sip in minutes. Salem lay stretched across the floor, looking perfectly unbothered by the seismic shift that had just taken place in the living room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice had been quiet, but not the stunned, spiraling kind of quiet Agatha feared. No, she was observing—absorbing. Her brows furrowed and unfurrowed. Her fingers curled lightly against the rim of her mug. Her eyes flicked between the two women in front of her with an intensity Agatha recognized. She was drawing conclusions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay?” Rio asked, her voice soft, tentative.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice blinked. “Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think so. It’s a lot. But I’m not freaked out or anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exchanged a quick glance with Rio, who looked visibly relieved. She let her hand rest gently on Rio’s back, grounding her. The last thing Rio needed today was to feel like her truth had driven someone away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice leaned forward, placing her mug on the coffee table with a gentle clink. “So. That Mara Greaves thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The name alone sent a prickle down Agatha’s spine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t say anything. Her fingers tightened slightly in the blanket she still had draped around her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s gaze stayed steady. “Was that about magic too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took in a slow breath. No use dodging it now. “Yes,” she said quietly. “She’s not just a folklorist. And she’s not just passing through.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s dangerous?” Alice asked, her voice more analytical than fearful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In a way that we don’t fully understand yet,” Agatha replied, her tone edged with caution. “But yes. There’s power in her. Old, cloaked power. She’s not just here to admire the scenery.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice nodded, sitting back slowly. “And you’ve known this since you first asked me to look into her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated. “We suspected it. The name she’s using… it’s not her only one. What you told Rio, that she uses the name Dahlia really helped. We found records of her that go back decades, and she looks exactly the same. Which isn’t exactly normal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A moment of silence passed between them. Alice tapped her fingers against her knee, then let out a small breath. “So what are we doing about her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help but smile slightly. “You’re taking this remarkably well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice gave her a sidelong glance. “I read a lot of fantasy. Also, I’m your girlfriend’s best friend. Or whatever you guys are to each other. That means I’m in it. No way I’m sitting on the sidelines now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned her head against Agatha’s shoulder, and Agatha wrapped an arm around her waist. She didn’t speak right away. The weight of responsibility was pressing hard against her ribs, but there was something stabilizing about the way Alice met her gaze—steady, unwavering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right now,” Agatha said carefully, “we’re just keeping watch. Strengthening wards. Making sure Rio has what she needs to stay safe and grounded. But if it escalates—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll handle it,” Alice finished.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a nod of quiet approval. “Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another moment of silence, warm this time. And then Alice, ever the breaker of tension, arched her brows and asked with mock seriousness, “So I’m betting that when you guys first kissed, flowers just exploded out of Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, amused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was that a magical reaction or are you two just</span>
<em>
<span> that</span>
</em>
<span> gay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned and covered her face with her hands. Agatha let out an honest laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Little bit of both,” she said, smirking. “But mostly her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The afternoon sun filtered lazily through the kitchen windows, catching the brown strands in Rio’s hair as she leaned against the counter. Agatha watched her from across the room, where she was finishing the last of the ward adjustments along the back door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t need a bodyguard, you know,” Rio said lightly, one brow raised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t smile. “That’s not what this is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head. “Then what is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed the kitchen slowly, wiping her hands on the dish towel and letting herself study her—calm, curious, stubborn. “You’re powerful, Rio. And you’re growing stronger by the day. We’ve seen it. So have others.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile faded a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped in front of her and reached out, brushing a bit of flour from her sleeve—leftover from Alice’s enthusiastic pancake experiment. “Which means it’s time we start focusing on more than just blooming flowers and pretty transformations. You need to know how to protect yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowned. “You think something’s coming?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think,” Agatha said carefully, “that something always is. Especially when you carry a Thread’s magic. Especially when you don’t know your full strength yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a breath, a little shaky. “Okay. So… what does that mean? Like, magical kung-fu training?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a small huff of laughter. “More like reflex work, shielding spells, energy redirection. Defense doesn’t necessarily mean aggression. It just means preparation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back a little, gaze skimming the floor. “I’ve never even been in a fight. Unless you count that time in high school where I spilled hot coffee on someone’s foot and they threw a muffin at me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t.” Agatha’s smile was brief. “Which is why we’ll start with the basics. And I’ll ask Wanda to join us. She’s excellent with defensive magic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “Wanda?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s already volunteered, actually,” Agatha said with a shrug, grabbing her mug. “She says your wild thread power is super exciting and she’s dying to see how it reacts under stress.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned. “That sounds deeply ominous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s because it is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio glanced up at her with wide eyes, Agatha gave her a sly, teasing grin. “Kidding. Mostly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled slowly, chewing her bottom lip. “Okay. Yeah. I guess if I’m going to be a magic person now, I should know how to not accidentally blow myself up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped closer again, her voice softer now. “It’s not just about you. It’s about the people you love. And what you’d do to keep them safe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something shifted in Rio’s expression then—less fear, more focus. Her eyes flicked toward the stairs, where Alice had disappeared earlier to journal or nap or both. Then back to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” she said quietly. “Let’s train.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, feeling something sharp and proud settle beneath her ribs. “Good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The clearing behind Wanda’s house was protected on all sides by a dense barrier of pines and enchanted bramble, quiet enough that even the wind respected its boundaries. It was one of the few places Agatha felt they could truly open up—no tourists, no nosy neighbors, and with all the wards in place, no chance of being spied on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood in the grass, brow furrowed in concentration as she tried for the third time to create a steady shield with her magic. Her palms were outstretched, fingers shaking slightly from effort, and the glowing shimmer of power that had flickered into existence around her arms was already starting to pulse like a heartbeat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s overextending,” Wanda murmured from beside Agatha. “Not grounding enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “She’s trying to brute-force it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can hear both of you,” Rio called without looking back, the frustration clear in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, darling, that’s the point,” Agatha replied, smiling softly. “Now relax. You’re not trying to hold up a wall—you’re asking the magic to protect you. Let it respond to your intent.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like it’s listening?” Rio asked, glancing over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda hummed. “Magic </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> listening. That’s half the point.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>From the sidelines, Alice was sipping a thermos of tea, sitting cross-legged on a picnic blanket that Wanda had charmed to stay warm. She was absolutely enthralled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, this is like Practical Magic meets X-Men,” Alice muttered. “Is this your danger room, or…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a dry look. “Only if you count poison ivy and judgment as training hazards.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice grinned and gave her a little salute with the thermos.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped forward. “All right. Let’s try a defensive exercise. Freeze time again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “You mean… on purpose?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did it once on instinct. But instinct isn’t the same as control. And if you want to really protect yourself, Rio, we need to train both.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed, then nodded. “Okay. How do I start?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda and I will throw spells,” Agatha said calmly. “Nothing harmful, just fast. Your goal is to feel them coming and freeze them the moment before they hit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice sat up straighter, eyes wide. “Wait. You’re actually attacking her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Light spells,” Wanda said mildly. “Barely a sting. Think of it like magical dodgeball.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Magical traumaball,” Alice muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took position across from Rio, watching her closely. “Close your eyes. Breathe. Don’t chase the power. Call it to you. Let it wrap around you like mist.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio did as instructed. Her breathing slowed. The air around her seemed to thrum—alive, alert.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Wanda exchanged a look. Wanda raised a hand first, murmuring a spell under her breath. A flicker of violet light pulsed toward Rio, and just as it neared her—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything stopped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sound of wind froze. The crackle of magic midair halted, suspended like glitter in honey. Agatha stood with her arm still lifted, but the world around her shimmered in pale gold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened her eyes slowly in the middle of that stillness, face lit with something close to awe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” she whispered. “I did it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment cracked open like glass as time surged forward again. Wanda’s spell fizzled harmlessly into the grass. Alice gasped. Agatha grinned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re incredible,” she said, stepping forward. “You didn’t just react—you commanded it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s shoulders dropped with a mix of pride and relief. “It felt easier. Not easy, but… like it knew what I needed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda gave a pleased nod. “That’s the Thread in you. She’s waking up fast.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice clapped enthusiastically from the blanket. “Okay, but can we acknowledge that my best friend just Matrix’d magic? I mean, if she learns to freeze time and do a backflip, I’m gonna combust.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed despite herself. “One step at a time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She caught Rio’s gaze then—soft, shining, full of surprise and wonder and maybe something deeper that Agatha didn’t dare name just yet. Not today.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she felt it. And that was enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Again?” Rio asked, already bracing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Again,” Agatha said, pride swelling in her chest. “Let’s push it further.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The next exercise was meant to be simple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A conjured obstacle, a push of defensive magic, a focused burst of Rio’s will—just enough to challenge her, not to harm. But power was a wild thing in someone so new to it, and Rio, stubborn and eager as ever, didn’t know how to slow down when she got excited.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha saw it in the flick of Rio’s fingers, in the way her brow creased, in the sudden gust of energy that rippled outward far too fast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait—” she started.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Too late.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The spell backfired in a bright, crackling burst—like a whip of light snapping back on Rio’s arm. She stumbled with a sharp cry and dropped to her knees in the grass, clutching her shoulder. Wanda was already moving, but Agatha was faster.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she breathed, kneeling beside her. “Let me see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine,” Rio gritted, even as her fingers trembled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice was halfway to them already, horror all over her face. “What the hell just happened?! She got zapped by her own power? What was that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer. She gently took Rio’s arm, rolling back the sleeve of her flannel to reveal the skin beneath—angry, red, already beginning to welt from magical blowback.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Too much power, not enough control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hissed through her teeth. “Okay. Maybe not fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled slowly, centering herself. “You’re alright. I’ve got you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She curled her hand around Rio’s forearm, her fingers firm but careful. The world narrowed—sound quieting, light dimming, until all that remained was the thrum of power under her skin, ancient and instinctual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha called it forward not with flash, but with certainty. The light that spread from her palm wasn’t bright or dramatic—it was soft. Steady. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath hitched, then steadied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The welt faded slowly, color leeching away like watercolor washed clean. The pain went with it. The heat in the wound disappeared under Agatha’s touch, and the skin knitted back into smoothness as if it had never been hurt at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice stared. “Holy shit. That’s… that’s not like Rio’s power.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha allowed herself a breath, her voice even. “No. It’s not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda stood nearby, watching the whole thing with a calm that spoke more of trust than surprise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice knelt down beside them, wide-eyed and utterly sincere. “So, like… how powerful are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer. She just brushed a strand of hair from Rio’s face and murmured, “Better?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded slowly, voice quiet. “Yeah. Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You scared me,” Agatha said, barely a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled faintly. “I’m sorry. Guess I got carried away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice let out a half-laugh, half-sigh and fell backward into the grass. “Okay. Okay. My best friend is a time-stopping nature witch, and her girlfriend is a literal magical doctor with the vibe of a sexy war general. This is fine. Everything is so normal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda snorted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha helped Rio to her feet, steadying her even though she didn’t need to. “That’s enough for today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” she said more firmly, and Rio didn’t argue. “Resting is also part of learning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked over at Alice, who gave her a huge, lopsided grin and a thumbs up. “Best birthday weekend ever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Also most dangerous,” Wanda added dryly. “And it’s only Sunday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her, a flicker of something fond and fierce blooming low in her chest. “I’m going to make some tea. You’re going to sit and breathe. Deal?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, just shy. “Yes, ma’am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes and turned toward the house. “And Alice? You’re helping. Might as well learn how to brew something more useful than black coffee.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice jumped up, clearly delighted. “Wait. Magical tea? Is this like, calming? Protective? Makes-you-float kind of tea?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Wanda muttered. “It’s chamomile, Alice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice shook her head. “You people really need a better marketing team.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved easily around the kitchen, her touch practiced but a little slower than usual, her mind still half on the training session and the flare of fear she’d felt when Rio had gone down. Alice stood by the counter, sleeves pushed up, sorting through the mismatched jars of dried herbs Rio kept in her cupboard like half-forgotten secrets.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s going to be okay,” Alice said after a moment, watching Agatha work. “Isn’t she?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at her, then gave a small nod. “She will be. She’s tougher than she looks.” A pause, then: “Though I’d like her to stop getting thrown around by spells during training. That would be nice. But I guess she’s still learning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice snorted, but her eyes were thoughtful. “I guess I didn’t expect magic to be so… intense.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not always like that,” Agatha murmured. “But when it is, it doesn’t care if you’re ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to pour the hot water into the teapot and set it between them on the counter. Alice watched her for a beat longer, lips pressing together before she finally said, “Can I ask you something kind of weird?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth quirked slightly. “Considering the last twenty-four hours, I think you get a pass.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice leaned against the counter. “You said Eliza never mentioned Rio before. Never said she had a granddaughter. But… don’t you think that’s kind of strange?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That made Agatha go still.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean, Eliza was clearly important to the town. And if Rio’s her granddaughter, you’d think people would know, right? Or at least remember her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned, brows knitting. “I never heard Eliza talk about a grandchild. But now that you mentioned it… yeah, it </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> kind of strange.” Her eyes narrowed slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice nodded slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There were rumors back then,” Agatha continued, her voice dropping. “Nothing concrete, just whispers. That Daisy had too much power, that she was unstable. Some said she overdosed, others said she was consumed by magic—burned out from the inside. No one really knew. No one really asked.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice frowned. “And when did that happen?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze drifted toward the window. “I was about twenty-one. My mother disappeared that same winter.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice blinked. “Seriously?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a slow nod. “She went out one night to do some of her rituals in the woods. She never came back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence settled for a moment, heavy but not oppressive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So Eliza lost her daughter,” Alice said softly, “and you lost your mom. At the same time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled. “I never connected the two before. But it’s hard not to now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before either of them could speak again, the back door creaked and the sound of voices filtered in—Rio’s low murmur, Wanda’s sharper laugh. Alice looked toward the door, then back at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If Daisy really was Rio’s mom,” she said quietly, “then Rio’s been in this longer than she knows.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes lingered on the teapot as if seeing something far beyond it. “Maybe even longer than we know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The back door swung open with a gentle creak, and the chill of the late afternoon breeze slipped in before Rio and Wanda did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Smells like something’s brewing,” Wanda called lightly, brushing her windblown curls out of her face as she stepped inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio followed, her cheeks pink from the cold and something else—lingering adrenaline, maybe, or the afterglow of being healed. Her eyes darted between the two women at the kitchen counter. “Hey. What did we miss?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice straightened, eyes flicking briefly to Agatha before she said carefully, “I was just asking Agatha about your grandmother. Eliza.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “Eliza?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a slow nod, moving toward the teapot and pouring herself a cup. “Alice asked if we knew Eliza had a granddaughter.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brow furrowed. “Oh. Did you? I mean, I never knew about her, but now I figure she probably knew something about me if she left me the cottage, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped closer, her voice low but even. “She never mentioned you, Rio. Not to me, or Wanda. No one in the town ever said Eliza had a granddaughter. But now we’re wondering if it’s because something—or someone—made us all forget.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes darkened. “Like a spell?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “A strong one. One that affects memory and perception. It’s possible she didn’t just keep you hidden from the world. She might’ve erased your existence from it. At least from everyone’s memory here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat down slowly at the table, her hands curling around a mug of tea she hadn’t even realized she’d picked up. “But why? Why would she do that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda leaned against the counter, crossing her arms. “Back then, there were rumors about Daisy—your mother. That she’d vanished under mysterious circumstances. Some said it was magic. Others said it was addiction. But nothing was ever confirmed. I was away at college then, so I don’t really remember.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And apparently it happened around the same time Agatha’s mom disappeared too,” Alice added quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze snapped to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a slow nod. “I never connected the two events before. I was twenty one and I wasn’t here. I was in New York at college. My mother went for a walk and never came back. People looked for her for days, but nothing was ever found. It was like she just vanished. But if Eliza lost Daisy then, too… maybe something happened then. Something big enough to make her believe you wouldn’t be safe in Thistle Grove anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s throat worked as she tried to swallow the sudden tightness rising there. “So she sent me away? Changed my memories? Everyone else’s, too? That’s insane.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She might’ve thought it was the only way to protect you,” Wanda said gently. “Whatever happened to Daisy… maybe Eliza feared the same fate for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a shaky breath, her fingers tightening around her mug. “Look, I don’t… I don’t know about any of that. As far as I’ve always known, I was in the system since I was a baby. That’s the story. That’s what’s real to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha said gently, “we’re not trying to take that away from you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” she said quickly, too quickly. “It’s just… even with all this magic stuff being true, and if something did happen back then—something with Daisy—I don’t remember it. Not one second of it. So if Eliza sent me away, if she erased me from this whole town… then she made that choice without me. She made it permanent. She took away the chance I had to grow up with an actual family.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice cracked, but she swallowed the sound. Her expression held steady, locked tight behind a mask of wry detachment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not ready to start rewriting my entire life because of some cooked up theories, I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly, not pressing. “That’s okay, sweetheart. We’re just… connecting dots. That’s all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a small nod, but she didn’t look at anyone as she stood and carried her untouched mug to the sink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice watched her carefully, still too new to this world to know what to say. Wanda didn’t speak either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned against the counter, arms folded. Outside, the wind picked up. “Whatever happened to Daisy or your mom or anyone else… it’s not like we have answers anyway. Just questions. And a whole lot of magic we barely understand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then maybe that’s where we start,” Wanda said, her voice calm but grounded. “Not with the past. With what’s in front of us now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That, at least, felt solid enough to stand on. Rio nodded again, slower this time. “Yeah. Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha caught her gaze and offered the smallest smile. “We go at your pace.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And for now, that was enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>They left Wanda’s house just after dusk, when the air had turned cool and a soft wind carried the scent of pine and smoke through the town. Wanda had offered them another round of tea or even dinner, but the suggestion to head over to the Silver Mare had won out quickly—mostly because Vision had just arrived and declared he definitely needed a drink after the day he’d had.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, the five of them made their way down the old cobblestone path toward the only bar in Thistle Grove, boots tapping a soft rhythm. Vision and Wanda walked ahead, chatting easily, while Alice walked with them, asking a string of questions about protective enchantments and illusion spells with the wide-eyed curiosity of someone who’d stepped into a fantasy novel and hadn’t quite come to terms with the fact it was real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stayed beside Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At first, Rio hadn’t said much. She nodded occasionally at something Alice said and even cracked a smile at one of Vision’s dry jokes, but Agatha saw the telltale signs—the way Rio’s fingers tugged at the edge of her sleeve, the faint crease between her brows, the way her eyes flicked up toward the darkening sky more than once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha felt it too. The shift.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A low, rolling tension curled above them like smoke. The sky had taken on a bruised hue, with clouds thickening faster than the wind could scatter them. A storm was building.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slowed her pace just a little until they fell behind the others. “You’re being awfully quiet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a sidelong glance. “Just tired.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow. “Tired’s not a feeling that brews thunderstorms overhead.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t laugh. Her gaze flicked upward again, lips pressing together in a line.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not… upset,” she said eventually. “I just—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Feel like everything you thought you knew about your past might be unraveling?” Agatha offered, gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a slow breath. “Yeah. That.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They walked in silence for another few steps before Agatha reached for her hand and laced their fingers together. “You don’t have to figure it all out tonight, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know.” But her voice was tight. “It’s just… I always thought I’d been in the system since I was a baby. That I’d never had a family. That I’d been abandoned. But now there’s this idea that maybe I did, and maybe they sent me away. On purpose.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We don’t know that,” Agatha said softly. “But knowing Eliza, if she really did do that, then it was definitely out of love, Rio. To protect you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her, and for a moment Agatha thought she might argue—but she didn’t. Instead, she squeezed Agatha’s hand and looked ahead again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Silver Mare came into view, tucked between two old stone buildings and glowing warmly from the inside out. Music drifted through the cracked front windows—bluesy and slow—and laughter echoed faintly behind the walls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let herself smile. “Come on, birthday girl. Let’s drink something ridiculously strong and forget about memory spells and lost mothers for just a little while.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finally cracked a smile. “As long as there’s no enchanted liquor involved.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No promises.”</span>

<p>
<span>The Silver Mare looked exactly like what a bar in a town like Thistle Grove should look like—low wooden beams, mismatched stools, a jukebox in the corner playing something old and twangy, and fairy lights strung over the bar that probably stayed up year-round. There was a dartboard with at least four holes in the wall around it, and the faint scent of fried food and pine cleaner lingered in the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was homey. Comforting. Normal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio needed normal. She needed to not think about foggy memories and missing mothers and the idea that maybe, just maybe, everything she thought she knew about her life was a carefully constructed lie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Birthday girl gets the honor of choosing the first round,” Wanda announced, patting Rio on the back before heading straight to the bar with Vision trailing behind her like a shadow. “And I’m making it strong so pick your poison.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I trust your judgement, almighty teacher,” Rio replied with a laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned close to Rio’s ear. “One drink, then I’m taking you to the pool table and absolutely kicking your ass. It’s the least I can do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed despite herself, grateful for the way Agatha’s voice always managed to cut through the fog in her brain. “Bold of you to assume I don’t have secret skills.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh no, I assume you do. I just assume mine are better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned and followed Agatha over, sinking into the seat beside her while Wanda returned with a tray full of tequila shots.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To Rio,” Wanda declared, raising her glass. “For being brave, for turning thirty-five, and for not letting either of those things get in the way of having fun tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They all raised their shots. Rio hesitated for half a second, then clinked hers against Agatha’s and downed it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The burn felt good. Like waking up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One shot turned into two, and soon enough, Agatha was dragging her over to the pool table with a devilish smirk. “You’re not getting out of this,” she said, handing Rio a cue stick. “Birthday or not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re enjoying this way too much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course I am. I’ve had a long week. Teaching you a lesson in physics and geometry disguised as pool will be the highlight of my evening.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio narrowed her eyes but couldn’t stop the smile tugging at her lips. “Fine. But if I win, you owe me a back massage.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I win, I’ll give you two and more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They played three rounds. Rio won one, barely. Agatha won the other two with the kind of smug elegance that made Rio want to both kiss her and smack her in equal measure. By the time they returned to the table, laughing and flushed, Alice was halfway through a sweet cider and Wanda was lining up another shot for Vision, who looked deeply unamused by the sugary cherry garnish on the rim.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flopped into the booth beside Agatha again, catching her breath. “You’re ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fantastic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, things felt light again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The clouds hadn’t fully cleared from the sky outside—Rio could still feel the weight of them, heavy and waiting—but inside this little bar, with Agatha’s thigh pressed against hers and the warm buzz of alcohol in her system, it didn’t matter. Not for now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t have all the answers, but she had people. She had moments like this. Laughter. Warmth. The comfort of being seen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bar had filled out by the time Rio finished her fifth game of pool — now undefeated, despite Agatha’s increasingly shameless tactics to distract her. There was music playing on the jukebox, something with a heavy beat and a chorus made for shouting, and the birthday girl had earned herself another round of drinks courtesy of Alice and a pair of charming older ladies at the next table over who’d declared her “too pretty not to be dangerous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was flushed and giddy by the time she slid back into her seat beside Agatha, her hand landing instinctively on the older woman’s thigh beneath the table. Agatha didn’t even flinch—she leaned into it, casual and warm and entirely hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision sat across from them, impeccably dressed in some dark blazer that looked way too sophisticated for a dive bar, even a cozy one like the Silver Mare. He had his hands wrapped around a pint glass, listening to Wanda chat with the bartender about rare meads and mushroom tinctures. But when Rio returned, his attention drifted politely back to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, Rio,” he said, tone light and inquisitive. “What does it feel like?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “What does what feel like?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To be a Thread,” he said, tilting his head slightly. “You’re the third, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She nodded slowly. “Apparently. Still figuring out what that even means, to be honest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled softly beside her. “It means she’s stubborn and reckless and powerful as hell,” she said, brushing a strand of hair from Rio’s cheek. “But also… yeah. It’s a lot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision smiled. “I’ve read about the Threads. Most of the old texts refer to them like legends—archetypes, not real people. Three witches bound by blood and purpose, representing something older than modern covens ever tried to define.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sounds dramatic,” Rio said, raising an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, it is,” Wanda said as she rejoined them, sliding another drink in Agatha’s direction. “The kind of thing we used to whisper about at Full Moon ceremonies when we were little girls. ‘What if the three Threads reunite in our lifetime?’ No one ever thought they actually would.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yet, here we are,” Vision said, eyes on Rio now. “All three of you in Thistle Grove. The magic must feel… different. Stronger.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It does,” Agatha admitted, taking a sip of her drink. “There’s something stirring. And with Rio here with so much untapped power, it’s like something has turned its head toward us again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled slowly. “I don’t even know how to describe it,” she said, resting her elbow on the table. “Half the time it feels like my blood is singing. The other half, I’m just trying not to accidentally summon a rainstorm if I stub my toe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision leaned forward, thoughtful. “You must be experiencing a sort of magical recalibration. Your presence changes the weave. Brings ancient enchantments back into motion. The land remembers, doesn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That made something in Rio still. </span>
<em>
<span>The land remembers</span>
</em>
<span>. She’d felt that more than once—walking through the woods, stepping into the garden behind the cottage, her dreams that felt like memories. The land did remember her. Even if she didn’t remember it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand found hers under the table again, grounding her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re handling it beautifully,” she said quietly. “No one expects you to have all the answers yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a small smile. “Yeah, well. I’ve got questions I don’t even know how to ask. Let alone answers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision studied her a moment longer, then offered a gracious smile. “Sometimes the questions matter more than the answers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was kind. Insightful. And if Agatha noticed anything strange about the way he watched Rio, she didn’t show it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just leaned in and kissed Rio’s temple, murmuring, “Come on, birthday girl. Dance with me before Alice challenges me to darts again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let herself be pulled to her feet, her heart still humming with warmth and whiskey and shots of tequila.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bar was buzzing in that golden hour of tipsy delight, where everyone’s cheeks were flushed and the pool table had devolved into friendly chaos. Rio was propped against the edge of the bar, nursing what might’ve been her fourth drink—or maybe her third, depending on how much Agatha had stolen from her last one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Across from her, Vision swirled his whiskey with a patient grace that made her wonder if he ever got drunk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” he said again, soft and casual, like they’d been circling this question for a while. “What’s it like, really? To be a Thread.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio squinted. “You already asked me that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did,” he said, smiling faintly. “But you didn’t really answer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a sip, letting the burn of the mezcal slow her down, keep her grounded. “It’s like…” She trailed off, glancing toward the table where Wanda and Alice were deep in a debate over pool rules.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s like being haunted by something beautiful,” she said finally. “Like I woke up one day and the world had been speaking to me my whole life, but I’d just never understood the language until now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision nodded slowly, eyes gleaming. “And now that you do?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “It’s loud. And terrifying. And kind of incredible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt Agatha before she saw her. Felt her fingers brush the small of her back, a touch so casual it could have been nothing, except it wasn’t. Not when her whole body leaned into it, not when heat coiled low in her belly like a tide turning in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slid beside her with the ease of someone who belonged there, who belonged with her. Her lips brushed Rio’s ear as she leaned in to speak, and Rio forgot whatever the hell Vision was saying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay?” Agatha asked softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Happily tipsy,” Rio replied. “Buzzed. Warm,” then she lowered her voice, “maybe a little turned on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A smile curved Agatha’s lips. “That’s the whisky talking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio said. “That’s you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stilled for half a second, something flickering behind her eyes. But then her hand found Rio’s waist and settled there like it belonged, fingers slipping just under the hem of her sweater in the most innocent </span>
<em>
<span>not </span>
</em>
<span>innocent way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Across from them, Vision was still sipping his drink, “It’s rare,” he said. “To see all three Threads together again. I wonder if Eliza ever imagined it would happen in her granddaughter’s lifetime.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “You make it sound like we’re some kind of prophecy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe you are,” he said, tone light, but not quite joking. “Or maybe fate just has a flair for the dramatic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was about to reply when Agatha leaned in again, voice a whisper. “You want to get some air?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t hesitate. “God, yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They slipped out the side door, unnoticed by the others. Outside, the air was sharp with cold and the faintest scent of woodsmoke from nearby chimneys. The Silver Mare’s walls were weathered wood and stone, and they ducked behind the stacked firewood where no one could see them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barely had time to turn before Agatha tugged her in, and their mouths met in a kiss that was all slow burn and aching relief. Rio melted into her, one hand fisted in Agatha’s coat, the other sliding into her hair like she’d been dying to touch her all night. Agatha kissed her like she’d been holding back— like she wanted to be good, but Rio’s mouth ruined her resolve.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have no idea what you do to me,” Agatha whispered, her breath hot against Rio’s throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pretty sure I do,” Rio breathed, shivering as Agatha’s hand found her hip, pulled her flush. “You think I haven’t noticed the way you look at me when you think I’m not watching?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed a breath, half-laugh, half-growl. “You’re impossible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You like impossible,” Rio whispered, then kissed her again, this time slower, deeper, hungrier. She pressed Agatha against the wooden wall, their bodies flush, her fingers tangling in dark waves of hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that—</span>
<em>
<span>blooms</span>
</em>
<span>. Tiny blossoms unfurled between the wooden slats of the wall, lavender and honeysuckle and something deep purple she didn’t even recognize. Agatha broke the kiss long enough to glance at them, and a grin broke across her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re blooming again,” she murmured, voice thick with amusement and want.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, well,” Rio said, breathless, “you started it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha brushed her thumb along Rio’s cheek, her eyes soft. “Happy birthday, love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she kissed her again like she was giving her something rare, something real, and Rio didn’t care about anything else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was warm all over. The kind of warm that made her limbs loose, her heart too full in her chest. The kind of warm that only came when Agatha touched her like this—like she meant every brush of her fingers, every hungry pull of her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The party was just behind that wall, laughter and clinking glasses muffled by distance and desire. But here, it was just them. Just this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s coat had slipped a bit from her shoulders, and Rio traced the curve of her collarbone through her sweater, marveling at how soft she was, how real this was despite everything else crashing around them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I could stay here forever,” Rio murmured, kissing the spot just below Agatha’s ear. “Forget the Threads, the dreams, the secrets.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “I’d give you that if I could.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You kind of are,” Rio said, her hands sliding down Agatha’s sides, feeling the hitch of breath between them. “Just… let me have this, for now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cupped her face then, thumbs brushing along her cheekbones with a tenderness that made something in Rio ache. “You always get what you want when you ask like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, leaning in until their lips just barely touched. “Then kiss me again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha did—slow and unhurried this time, like she was savoring every second. Their mouths moved in perfect rhythm, no rush, just heat and want and something deeper curling between their ribs. Rio’s hands wandered beneath Agatha’s sweater, skimming across warm skin, and Agatha didn’t stop her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The wind picked up around them, but the blossoms stayed. Vines coiled lazily along the wooden slats, blooming in impossible shapes—flowers that hadn’t existed in centuries, colors that shimmered like dreams.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back just long enough to look at them, her breathing uneven. “You know this isn’t normal, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brow furrowed. “The kissing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The magic,” Agatha said, breathless with awe. “It’s not supposed to react like this to anyone. Not even the Threads. But with you—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s always been like this, though,” Rio said softly. “With you. I touch you, and something wakes up. I feel like I’ve been waiting for it my whole life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her for a long moment, something unspoken passing between them. Then she kissed her again, slower now, deeper. Her hands found Rio’s waist, pulled her close until their hips aligned, and Rio pressed into her with a soft gasp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stayed like that—lost in each other. Kissing until they were dizzy and dazed, until the world felt like it belonged only to them. Until Rio forgot the ache of her past, the confusion in her chest, the strange pull of fate she hadn’t asked for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Here, there was only Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that was more than enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>They didn’t hear the footsteps at first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was too lost in the way Agatha’s mouth dragged across her jaw, in the heady warmth pooling between them. Her hands slid up under Agatha’s sweater again, just a teasing brush, and Agatha gave a soft hum against her skin that made Rio smile into the kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then a twig snapped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Both women froze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes opened first. Sharp, alert. She pulled back slowly, her hand curling protectively around Rio’s wrist. “Did you hear that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio whispered, heart thudding suddenly—not from arousal this time, but from the prickling awareness crawling up her spine. The kind she’d learned to trust. “That wasn’t the wind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They turned as one, but there was nothing there. Just the trees swaying softly in the wind, the edge of the Silver Mare’s back patio bathed in golden light, music still pulsing faintly behind them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha’s gaze narrowed. Her magic shimmered subtly in the air, a protective pulse reaching outward like a silent radar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Someone had been there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And they hadn’t been drunk. Or clumsy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They’d been watching.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped forward, hand outstretched, as if she could pluck the presence from the shadows. But there was nothing now—no energy, no spell residue, no lingering thread of magic. Just silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swore softly and turned back to Rio, brushing her fingers over the other woman’s cheek. “Let’s go inside.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who do you think it was?” Rio asked, voice low.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” Agatha admitted. “But they were good at hiding their tracks. Too good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And somewhere, just out of sight, a figure crouched behind the trees. Cloaked in old magic and quiet power, they watched as the two women returned to the warm light of the bar, laughter swallowing them up again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the figure didn’t laugh. They just tilted their head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Three Threads. Together again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was only a matter of time now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio and Agatha stepped back into the Silver Mare, they were met with a blast of laughter, music, and the clink of glasses. The bar was still lively, though the crowd had thinned a bit, giving everything a looser, more languid energy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice caught sight of them first and immediately grinned like she knew exactly what they’d been up to. “Took you long enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, perched at the corner of their booth with a whiskey in hand, raised an eyebrow. “Was there a line for the bathroom… or were you just very, very thorough?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flushed, her mouth opening to protest, but Agatha just strolled in beside her, smooth as ever, and said, “A lady never tells.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That earned a snort from Wanda and a cackle from Alice, who slid over to make space. “You missed Vision trying to talk me into some metaphysical theory about magical threads and divine balance. I think he wants to write a book or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision, still seated with a tumbler of something dark, offered a mild smile. “Just fascinated by the convergence we’re witnessing. It’s rare. Historic, even.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sank back into the booth, trying to will the heat from her face. She could still taste Agatha on her lips, and her heart hadn’t entirely returned to its normal pace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision’s eyes gleamed with polite curiosity. “It’s remarkable. Truly. And this connection between you three—Rio, Agatha, Wanda—it’s stronger than anything we’ve seen in generations.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Feels strong,” Wanda muttered, finishing her drink. “Feels like we’re being pulled toward something. I just don’t know what yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze wandered back toward Agatha for a moment, catching the way she seemed calm on the surface, but her fingers were curling ever so slightly where they rested on the table. Like she felt it too—that slow gathering of energy. Of change.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stayed like that for a while longer, trading stories, laughing louder as the alcohol loosened everyone’s edges. Rio felt warm and buzzy and, despite everything looming beyond the walls of the bar, good. She caught Agatha watching her once or twice—open, amused, hungry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time they decided to call it a night, the moon was high and the wind had picked up again, brushing across her skin like a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they stepped outside, Rio glanced up at the clouds shifting over Thistle Grove.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The night air was crisp and smelled faintly of salt and pine. The last burst of laughter echoed behind them as the door swung shut. The buzz from drinks and good company lingered like a glow under their skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tugged her coat tighter around her and leaned briefly into Agatha’s side, her cheek brushing the edge of her shoulder. Agatha didn’t even hesitate before curling an arm around her waist, drawing her in close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda stretched her arms over her head with a groan. “That was fun,” she said, her voice warm with liquor and a little sentimentality. “You two can definitely party.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision gave a small smile. “Indeed. Though I suspect some of us may regret that final round of shots.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> idea, darling,” Wanda said, poking him in the ribs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I regret nothing,” Vision replied dryly. He turned to Agatha and Rio, his gaze flickering thoughtfully between them. “Thank you for letting me tag along. It was enlightening.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow at the phrasing, but she was too mellow from whiskey and Rio’s proximity to question it. “We’ll do it again sometime.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision nodded. “Goodnight, all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda leaned over and gave Agatha a quick hug before grabbing Vision’s arm and steering him down the sidewalk toward their car. “Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do,” she called over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That leaves very little on the table,” Agatha called back with a laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once they were gone, Alice gave an exaggerated yawn and squinted up at the sky. “Okay. So back to the cottage?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to her with a faint smirk. “Nope. You’re both coming back with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice blinked. “I don’t wanna cockblock you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not,” Agatha said smoothly. “I have a perfectly lovely guest room. You’ll be comfortable. Unbothered. Untraumatized.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted, still tucked into Agatha’s side. “And she makes really good tea in the morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not surprised,” Alice said, tilting her head. “You look like someone who owns an assortment of loose-leaf herbs and judges people who use bagged chamomile.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised both eyebrows. “I do judge that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice grinned, but she still hesitated. “Seriously, though, are you sure? I can just go back to Rio’s cottage, it’s fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha softened. “You’re not a guest. You’re Rio’s family. Which makes you more than welcome.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice studied her for a beat, like she hadn’t quite expected that response. Then she nodded once. “Alright. Lead the way, oh gracious witch of high-thread-count sheets.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a quiet laugh and pressed a kiss to the side of Rio’s head before stepping forward. “Come on then. The night’s not over yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And as they walked down the sleepy street together, something about it felt—if only for a little while—like home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they made it to Agatha’s place, Mr. Scratchy was waiting for them by the door, like a parent ready to scold their teenagers for being out too late.</span>
</p><p>
<span> “Alice, meet Mr. Scratchy,” Agatha said, guiding Alice into the living room where a sleek, white rabbit with twitching ears hopped back to the couch with a huff. Mr. Scratchy looked at Alice with large, inquisitive eyes before hopping over to her, nudging her leg.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice giggled, crouching down to pet him. “He’s adorable! He seems so calm,” Alice said, her voice full of affection as she stroked the rabbit’s soft fur.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s a bit of a character,” Agatha replied with a grin, though there was a fondness in her voice. “He’s my familiar. Comes with the territory.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does he… help with like… magic?” Alice asked, eyes wide with curiosity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“More like a reminder,” Agatha answered, glancing at Rio with a knowing look. “That there’s still a bit of magic in all of us.” She patted Mr. Scratchy gently. “But he mostly likes to nap and watch over things.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha led Alice upstairs, showing her to the guest room at the end of the hallway. “Make yourself comfortable. If you need anything, just let me know. And feel free to get anything from the kitchen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, who had followed them upstairs, paused by the door. “I’ll just go to your room and wait for you,” she told Agatha with a smile. “Night, Al.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice gave her a quick wave and entered the room, closing the door behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s exhaustion, however, had already caught up with her. She wasn’t sure if it was the combination of the long day or the alcohol, but as soon as she laid down on the soft bed in her own room, her body relaxed, and the weight of everything seemed to melt away. Her eyes fluttered shut, and she immediately slipped into a deep, dreamless sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The night passed quietly, but Rio woke briefly when she felt the soft pressure of someone sliding into the bed beside her. Agatha’s warm body pressed against hers, and before she could fully process it, Agatha’s arms wrapped around her in a gentle, comforting hug. Rio’s mind buzzed with a quiet mix of confusion and contentment, but her body surrendered to sleep again, the tension leaving her muscles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her dreams, however, were a chaotic whirlwind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nothing made sense. It was as though she were floating through a series of fragmented images, memories that weren’t hers, flashes of places and faces she didn’t recognize. She felt lost in the swirling void, but there was a constant, a thread of safety wrapped around her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, a voice—a soft, familiar voice, though not one she had ever heard before. “I love you so much, my little witch,” it whispered, the words sweet and full of love. “I’m so proud to be your mama, baby girl.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The voice didn’t belong to anyone she knew, but the warmth of it settled over her like a blanket, and she felt a sense of peace that she couldn’t explain. It was comforting, though, as if the universe itself had wrapped her in its arms. The voice spoke again, but it was distant, as if fading away: “I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio finally woke up, she felt disoriented, as if she had been wading through a fog. The morning light streamed softly through the window, and she blinked in confusion. The dream still clung to her like a memory she couldn’t quite grasp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shook her head, trying to clear the remnants of the dream. It had to have been the alcohol. She hadn’t even realized how much she had drunk the night before. Definitely just the alcohol, Rio told herself, pushing the strange, comforting sensation away as best as she could.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But for some reason, that voice, that love, lingered in the back of her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned softly as she reached out for her phone, blinking against the too-bright screen. 5:57 AM. Ugh. Too early. Her head throbbed faintly with the echo of tequila and laughter from the night before, but not enough to ruin the soft warmth pressed against her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled sleepily and set her phone back down on the nightstand, careful not to let the light disturb the cocoon of quiet surrounding them. She rolled over slowly, fitting herself into the curve of Agatha’s body. The older woman let out a soft, disgruntled noise, nuzzling her face into the pillow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t help it—she pressed her face into Agatha’s neck, sighing at the scent of her: lavender, scotch, and something a little wild.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stirred, groaning as her arms instinctively tightened around Rio. “Mmnn—what time is it?” she mumbled, voice scratchy and lower than usual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Too early,” Rio whispered, barely above a breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh.” Agatha didn’t even lift her head. “Tell time to go to hell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stifled a laugh. “You’re so grumpy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because I drank half a distillery with your best friend last night,” Agatha muttered, cracking one eye open to look at her. “And I think I accidentally promised Alice I’d let her read my tarot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did,” Rio said, grinning. “She took it very seriously.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned again and pulled the blanket over her head. “This is why I avoid people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You let me in,” Rio whispered, resting her forehead against Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A pause. Then Agatha sighed, voice muffled under the covers. “…Yeah. I really did, didn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t answer. She just closed her eyes and let the silence fall again, warm and safe, with the smallest, hungriest part of her heart wondering what it meant to be let in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room was still dim, bathed in the soft gray-blue light of early morning. Outside, the world was quiet—just the rustle of leaves in the breeze and the occasional creak of the old house settling into the day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Somewhere between sleep and waking, Rio drifted in a warm haze, curled under the blankets. Agatha’s arm was still wrapped around her, and for a few more precious minutes, she allowed herself to sink into the comfort of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then—something soft and slow pressed to her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stirred, brows drawing together as her body registered the kiss, then another, just below her ear. She inhaled sharply, eyes fluttering open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was awake now, and definitely not under the covers anymore. Dressed, even. Her lips brushed Rio’s skin with lazy affection, and Rio could feel the faintest smile against her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm,” Rio mumbled, still not fully ready to leave the cocoon of sleep. “That tickles.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re warm and smell like sleep,” Agatha murmured, her voice velvet-soft. “I should be opening the shop right now, but—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But you’re here.” Rio turned onto her back, eyes half-lidded as she looked up at her. “You’re already dressed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned, her damp curls pushed back behind her ears, still tousled in that way Rio found almost unfairly sexy. She smelled like lavender soap and toothpaste, fresh and clean and unmistakably her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I couldn’t resist,” she said simply. “You’re in my bed. All soft and curled up and…” She kissed the edge of Rio’s jaw, lingering there. “I just needed one more minute.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached up, touching the front of Agatha’s shirt with sleepy fingers. “You can have all the minutes you want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed against her skin. “Careful. I might hold you to that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And in that moment—eyes heavy, body warm, the scent of lavender and the sweetness of Agatha’s breath filling the space between them—Rio felt something quiet settle inside her. Like peace. Like maybe, just maybe, this was what home could feel like.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could live in this moment forever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she only said, voice rough with sleep, “Go open your shop before the town stages a coup.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled and kissed her once more, softer this time. “Okay. But tonight? I want you back in this bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, eyes closing again. “I’m not going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood and smoothed her hands down the front of her shirt, still smiling as she leaned over Rio once more. She pressed a quick kiss to her temple and murmured, “Breakfast is ready downstairs—eggs, toast, and the strongest coffee I could manage without summoning a minor demon. Alice’s already poking around the kitchen asking questions I don’t have answers to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a sleepy little groan. “You’re a saint.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha said, already halfway to the door, “just a woman in desperate need of caffeine and plausible deniability.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the door creaked shut behind her, Rio let her head fall back into the pillows with a soft thud. Her gaze drifted toward the ceiling, her mind still tangled in the edges of that strange dream.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That voice.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I love you so much, my little witch… I’m so proud to be your mom, baby girl.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The words replayed in her head like an echo that hadn’t quite faded. It had felt real—more real than most dreams. There was something ancient in it, something deep. She wished she had her grimoire with her, the one Agatha had helped her unlock, the one that felt more and more like an extension of her soul.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Thump</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something solid landed on the bed beside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat up fast, eyes wide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her grimoire—leather-bound, faintly glowing at the edges, with that familiar scent of old parchment and honeysuckle—rested right next to her, exactly as she’d left it at home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“…Okay,” she breathed, reaching out to touch it. “That’s new.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment her fingers brushed the cover, the sigils along its spine shimmered briefly, like the book was responding to her presence. She opened it to a blank page and saw her pen, tucked neatly inside, waiting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The dream hadn’t just been a dream.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Heart thudding, Rio sat cross-legged on the bed, hair mussed, blanket pooling at her waist, and began to write. The words poured out of her as though she were remembering, not imagining. Every detail—the colors, the voice, the feeling of safety—etched onto the page like truth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And as the ink dried, the room seemed to hum softly around her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>After finishing the last line in her grimoire, Rio closed it gently and let her fingers rest on the worn leather cover for a moment longer. She took a slow breath, heart still beating with that faint thread of something she couldn’t name—comfort, maybe. Or magic. Or both.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a quiet sigh, she slid off the bed and padded to the bathroom. A quick shower helped rinse away the last of sleep, though the memory of the dream still clung to her skin like mist. The house was quiet around her, cozy in that creaky, old-cottage way, the warm scent of toast drifting up through the floorboards.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wrapped in a towel, she opened the little wardrobe in Agatha’s room and hesitated for only a second before grabbing one of her oversized button-downs—deep navy and soft from wear—and pulling it on over her tank top and leggings. She caught her reflection in the mirror and laughed under her breath. The shirt hung off her shoulder and smelled just like Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Totally not a problem.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tiptoed downstairs, the floor cool beneath her feet, until she reached the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice was already there, sitting at the worn wooden table with a steaming mug of coffee in hand and a plate of toast in front of her. She looked up as Rio walked in and grinned like a fox. “Well, well, well. Look who’s wearing her girlfriend’s clothes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a look as she grabbed her own plate. “They are not my girlfriend’s clothes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?” Alice tilted her head dramatically. “Because that’s definitely a button-down I saw Agatha wear at dinner the other night. You look like you just wandered out of a very cozy cottagecore romance novel.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes and sat across from her. “It hasn’t even been a week.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yet you’re glowing. And stealing her clothes. And humming.” Alice pointed at her with a fork. “You don’t hum, Rio. That’s like—true love level behavior.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio choked on a bite of toast. “Okay, first of all, no one’s in love. That’s insane.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure,” Alice said, nodding slowly like she was humoring her. “Not in love. Just enchanted. Bewitched. Totally, utterly under the spell of a hot witch with great bone structure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio narrowed her eyes. “You’re enjoying this too much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice grinned wide. “You bet your ass I am. This is the most alive I’ve seen you in months.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened her mouth, ready to argue—but paused. That part? That was true.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a sip of coffee, looking down at her borrowed shirt, then out the window to the little garden beyond.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe it had only been a week.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But maybe time didn’t work the same when magic was involved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio toyed with the edge of her toast, staring out the window for a beat longer. The sunlight was soft, golden, filtering through the crooked lace curtains and hitting the old floorboards just right. Everything about this place felt like it shouldn’t belong to her, and yet—she hadn’t felt out of place since she arrived.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not saying I’m in love,” she muttered finally, voice quiet, “but… I think I’m starting to get her, you know? And that’s kind of terrifying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice raised an eyebrow. “Because she’s a witch? Or because she makes you feel things?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed. “Because I can’t figure out if this is real or if it’s just some fever dream that started when I rolled into town.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice leaned back in her chair, balancing her mug against her thigh. “Okay, but listen. I know you. And you don’t dream about domestic bliss and sexy witches and suddenly start humming unless something real is happening. You don’t do surface-level, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rubbed her forehead. “Don’t psychoanalyze me while I’m eating scrambled eggs in a borrowed shirt.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will psychoanalyze you anytime I want. It’s part of the best friend contract.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re impossible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you,” Alice said, leaning forward now, “are clearly falling for her. Even if you’re too stubborn to admit it yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked down at her plate, then back toward the stairs—toward the bedroom, the dream, the warmth of Agatha pulling her close, the voice whispering in the dark.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what this is,” she said quietly. “But I don’t want to run from it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s expression softened, her teasing dialed down. “Good,” she said. “Because for the first time in a long while, you don’t look like you’re running.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat in silence for a few moments after that, just the soft clink of cutlery and the smell of coffee and butter filling the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Alice added, “Also, I’m totally going to call you Mrs. Harkness next time you hum.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned and threw a piece of toast at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, still half-smiling despite herself, stood and grabbed her now-empty plate, rinsing it quickly in the sink. “Alright, Mrs. Harkness jokes aside, I need to go feed Salem before he starts knocking over furniture out of protest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice stretched, still sipping her coffee. “That cat has opinions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s dramatic,” Rio said with a shrug. “Wonder where he gets it from.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice smirked. “Definitely not his witch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a playful side-eye and wiped her hands on a dish towel. “We can stop by the apothecary on the way—my car’s still parked there. Left it before we went to Wanda’s for training.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice perked up. “Ooh, yes. I want to snoop around Agatha’s place of business. See if she keeps potions labeled ‘Lust’ or ‘Break Their Knees.’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She does, actually,” Rio said, deadpan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s eyes widened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m kidding.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“…Are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t answer—just smiled and headed for the front door. “C’mon. Let’s go before Salem starts casting hexes for real.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice followed with a dramatic gasp. “Wait—can he do that? Because I swear he gave me a migraine just by glaring at me yesterday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The little bell above the apothecary door chimed as Rio and Alice stepped inside, the warm scent of dried herbs, clove, and lavender wrapping around them like a familiar hug. Sunlight streamed through the tall front windows, catching on rows of glass jars and potion bottles arranged with a kind of casual elegance that was so Agatha—half chaos, half magic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the front counter, Agatha stood in conversation with a customer, a tall woman with a tired expression and a jar of something amber-colored cradled in her hands. Agatha’s tone was gentle but firm, explaining something about dosage and dream residue, her fingers tracing a sigil lightly on the lid before she handed it over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she looked up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes landed on Rio instantly, like she’d been expecting her all morning. The change in her face was immediate—her features softened, her smile bloomed slow and wide, and it was the kind of smile that seemed meant only for her. Not performative, not charming for charm’s sake. Just warm. Honest. Quietly hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The butterflies in Rio’s stomach fluttered so hard it was almost dizzying. She felt them pushing against her ribs like they were about to make a run for it, wings beating wildly just under her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>God, it wasn’t fair how easily Agatha could do that to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held her gaze a second longer, her smile lingering before she turned back to her customer and wrapped up the sale with a few soft-spoken words and a flourish of her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice leaned in with a whisper that wasn’t nearly quiet enough. “She smiles like that at you and you’re still trying to say you’re not in love?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her, deadpan. “Do you want to be hexed?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice grinned, smug as ever, and nudged her forward just as Agatha stepped out from behind the counter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning,” Agatha said, eyes never leaving Rio. “You found your way back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, her voice caught somewhere in her throat. “Yeah. Had to pick up my car. I have to go feed Salem.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips twitched into something a little sly. “I’m sure Salem’s been rehearsing his curses all morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice gave a theatrical bow. “We’ll have to walk in prepared for battle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio couldn’t quite bring herself to look away from Agatha—not with the way she stood there, sunlight dancing through her dark hair, smelling like herbs and honey and safety. Not with the way her smile hadn’t faded, not even a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not with the way Rio could already feel herself falling, just a little further.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had barely managed to string together a coherent thought when Agatha’s gaze flicked down—just briefly—and her smile curved into something sharper, softer, all at once. Her eyes lingered on the open edge of Rio’s coat, where the dark navy collar of her borrowed shirt peeked out unmistakably.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re wearing my shirt,” Agatha said, low and amused, like it was a secret just between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened her mouth to deny it—on reflex, maybe, or because her heart was already hammering too loudly—but she didn’t get the chance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped closer with the kind of quiet confidence that always made Rio forget how to breathe. She crossed the space between them, then slipped an arm around Rio’s waist and tugged her close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her breath catch—right there in her throat—because Agatha didn’t just hug her. No, she anchored her. One hand on her hip, the other ghosting along her back, holding her like she’d been waiting all morning for the chance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The shop disappeared a little around them. The jars and herbs and customers and curious best friends all faded into something blurry, something soft. The scent of Agatha’s perfume—lavender, citrus, something sweet and hard to place—settled around Rio like a spell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice dipped, just for her. “You look better in it than I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed, her arms instinctively finding their way around Agatha’s waist. “That’s not true.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm,” Agatha murmured, brushing her thumb along the curve of Rio’s hip through the fabric. “It is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt herself flush, felt the butterflies turn into something molten and warm, fluttering low in her belly. She wanted to stay there forever. Just like that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she cleared her throat instead and tried for levity, because that’s what she always did when things felt too real. “I was just borrowing it. Emergency shirt situation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned in, voice a little huskier now. “You can borrow anything you want, darling. Though I’m not sure I’ll want to wash it once it smells like you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nearly combusted on the spot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice, somewhere in the background, made a dramatic gagging noise that Rio pointedly ignored.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled softly and pressed a kiss to her cheek—nothing grand, nothing showy. Just soft. Intimate. The kind of kiss that said I see you, I want you.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t let go. Not for a long moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t want to.</span>
</p><p> </p>

<p>
<span>Agatha watched Rio and Alice walk out the door, the soft chime of the bell the only sound she allowed herself to focus on for a moment. Rio glanced back once—just a quick look, shy and warm beneath the brim of her beanie—and Agatha felt her heart pull in that familiar, ridiculous way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Text me when you get a break,” Rio had said over her shoulder at the door, brushing their fingers together for the briefest second. “We’ll come back later if you’re free.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had nodded, not trusting herself to say much with Alice standing so smugly at Rio’s side. “Be careful. The roads are slick.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled—soft, like it was just for her. “I always am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then they were gone, their boots crunching into fresh snow as they headed toward the car parked at the end of the path.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood still for half a beat, eyes lingering on the spot where Rio had been, before she exhaled through her nose and turned back toward the shop. She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and squared her shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No time to dwell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The apothecary had already started to buzz again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By midmorning, the shop was full—locals popping in for restocks, tourists still lingering in town after the festival over the weekend. The snow had only added to the charm of Thistle Grove, blanketing the town in postcard-worthy quiet, but it also meant chapped lips, seasonal allergies, and an uptick in hot tonic orders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t mind. Not today.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved through the space like a current—graceful, deliberate, practiced. She mixed teas, measured tinctures, offered advice and subtle charm in equal measure. She knew how to work a room, even one filled with aching joints and wide-eyed city girls asking if the “energy-cleansing salt” was edible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bell above the door rang over and over again, and Agatha didn’t stop moving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She liked this—being busy. It kept her hands occupied and her mind focused. It gave her no space for soft distractions like Rio’s voice in her ear or the warmth of her body under the covers or the way she looked this morning in her shirt, standing in the middle of Agatha’s shop like she belonged there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But even as she tried to keep her head down, even as she blended and bottled and swept herbs into little waxed paper pouches, the image lingered:</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio in her shirt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio in her bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, sleepy and warm, whispering that she could have all the minutes she wanted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And gods help her—Agatha wasn’t sure what scared her more: how fast this thing was unfolding, or how badly she already wanted more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Agatha made it through the last layer of wards and stepped into the clearing behind Wanda’s house, the nearly winter air nipped at her cheeks and her boots crunched softly over the snow-dusted ground. The protective enchantments shimmered faintly in the air behind her—sigils etched into the bark of the trees, glowing just enough to let her know she was exactly where she was meant to be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had been a couple of days. She’d seen glimpses of Rio here and there—quick texts, a few lingering voice messages that played too softly for anyone else to hear—but work had swallowed them both whole. Monday and Tuesday had vanished in a blur of potions and appointments and Rio’s deadlines.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So this—this quiet, secret space in the woods, carved out by Wanda and cloaked in powerful magic—felt like breathing again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes found Rio instantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood near the fire Wanda had conjured, bundled up in a thick sweater, dark curls tucked into a hat that didn’t quite hide the concentration on her face. Her brow was furrowed as Wanda paced in front of her, gesturing toward the open air and tracing glowing defensive runes with a flick of her fingers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled before she even realized it was happening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t call out, didn’t interrupt. She just watched for a second, her chest pulling tight with something too complicated for a name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was listening—so intently, so open to this strange new world she’d stumbled into. She looked steady. Strong. And something about it made Agatha’s pulse slow in the best way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice sat nearby in a makeshift chair of thickly padded cushions and wool blankets, wrapped up like a human burrito. She gave Agatha a silent wave and pantomimed shivering dramatically as Agatha stepped closer to the fire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, of course, didn’t miss a beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re late,” she said without looking up, though her lips twitched faintly. “As usual.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a dry look. “Some of us have to keep capitalism from collapsing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda snorted and gestured toward Rio. “And some of us are trying to make sure your girlfriend doesn’t accidentally explode herself next time she draws the wrong sigil.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s not my—” Agatha began, then immediately gave up when both Wanda and Alice raised eyebrows in unison. “Fine. Continue.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda winked and turned back to Rio, whose cheeks were already flushed from the cold—or maybe from Agatha’s arrival. Her eyes flicked toward Agatha just once, a glimmer of something warm and steady passing between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped closer, her coat catching firelight as she joined the circle. “Hope I didn’t miss the part where we fight demons.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, the kind that made Agatha want to pull her in by the collar and kiss her breathless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No demons yet,” she said, voice soft but sure. “Just some very judgmental runes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled and folded her arms, settling in beside her. “You’ll charm them eventually. You’ve got that look.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What look?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer—just reached out and brushed a curl from Rio’s cheek, letting her hand linger a second longer than necessary.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That look, she thought, and smiled to herself as Wanda began the next part of the lesson.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda waved her fingers, and the glowing runes she’d been sketching in the air drifted down into the snow like embers. “Alright,” she said briskly, “we’ve covered basic wards, circle casting, and minor hex deflection. Time for something fun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes widened just slightly. “Fun usually means dangerous when you say it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Correct,” Wanda said, far too cheerfully. “But it’s also the quickest way to learn. Now”—she clapped her gloved hands together—“I want you to form a shield. Visualize it like a dome over your body. Hold the image, feel the shape of it in your chest, then pull it into your hands. Got it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded slowly, brow furrowing again, and raised her hands. The magic was still new, still raw—but it didn’t rebel against her anymore. It met her like something curious, something willing to listen. Pale golden light shimmered at her fingertips as she began to draw the shape Wanda had described.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, silent at her side, watched with a kind of reverence she usually reserved for rare ingredients and ancient spells. Rio’s lips were slightly parted, her breath puffing in the cold as she concentrated, and her magic responded with a flickering pulse that wrapped around her like heat rising from the fire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Wanda said, nodding. “Now hold it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she threw a ball of energy at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was small, controlled, nothing dangerous—but Agatha still twitched, even though she knew Wanda wouldn’t actually hurt her. The spell slammed into the shield with a sharp crackle and fizzled out in a burst of sparks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flinched but didn’t drop the shield.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda grinned. “Not bad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked down at her hands, almost disbelieving. “I did it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did,” Agatha said, voice warm with pride. “Held it like a pro.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned to her, glowing just a little brighter than the runes in the snow, and Agatha couldn’t help herself—she reached out and tucked a loose strand of hair back under Rio’s hat. Her fingers lingered near her cheek, and for a heartbeat, the entire clearing seemed to still around them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re getting good at this,” Agatha said softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ducked her head, but the smile stayed. “I had a good teacher.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda groaned. “Oh for the love of the goddess, if you two start making out next to my fire I will douse you both with freezing rain.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice snorted from her blanket pile. “Please do. It’s getting saccharine in here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t step away, not just yet. She didn’t care if Wanda teased or Alice gagged—she hadn’t seen Rio in days and this moment, this warmth, was hers to savor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, Wanda relented with a wave of her hand. “Alright, let’s break for food before I teach her how to hex a man from thirty yards.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I already know how to do that,” Rio said dryly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned, eyes gleaming. “That’s my girl.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as Wanda dramatically spun on her heel and marched off toward the house, Alice trailing after her with a theatrical sigh and an exaggerated shiver, Rio’s hand shot out and caught Agatha’s wrist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned, one brow arched, amused and already halfway into some flirtatious remark—</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio didn’t let her speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tugged her in close, right up against her, snow crunching under their boots as their bodies aligned. And then she kissed her—really kissed her—deep and slow, like the buildup of a spell finally loosed into the world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stilled for only half a breath, and then her arms came around Rio’s waist, pulling her closer. The fire crackled behind them, casting warm flickers across their skin, but it had nothing on the heat curling between them now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio finally pulled back, her breath visible in the cold, her eyes were darker and full of something steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I missed you,” she said, voice low and a little hoarse. “And I really didn’t want to wait until later to do that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha just looked at her for a moment, lips parted, hair tousled, cheeks pink from more than the chill. Then, with a slow smile and a voice like velvet, she murmured, “Do it again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And this time, they both leaned in at once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The second kiss was deeper, slower, like a thread winding tighter between them—until a sharp voice cut through the air like a gust of cold wind:</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my goddess, get your asses inside before I set the ward on fire!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio jerked back with a startled laugh, forehead falling against Agatha’s shoulder as Agatha sighed dramatically.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you ever let people have a moment?” Agatha called toward the house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!” Wanda’s voice floated back from the kitchen door. “Moments are for people who aren’t freezing their asses off while soup gets cold!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned against Agatha’s coat, her breath warming the wool, before finally stepping back. Agatha didn’t let go completely though—she kept one arm slung casually around Rio’s waist as they walked together toward the house, boots crunching through packed snow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, the kitchen smelled like rosemary and garlic and something rich bubbling on the stove. Wanda had thrown together a hearty stew, and the fire in the hearth made everything feel impossibly cozy. Alice was already curled up at the table with a steaming mug in both hands, looking like a cat who’d claimed a particularly warm sunspot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hate that I’m leaving Sunday,” she moaned. “You’re all just getting to the good part, and I’m going to be stuck on a plane with crying babies and no magic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll save you some cursed herbs as a souvenir,” Wanda deadpanned, setting bowls on the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once everyone had settled in with food and wine, the conversation turned to catch-up. Agatha leaned her elbow on the table, eyes flicking to Rio as she spoke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shop’s been slammed since the weekend,” she said, swirling her wine. “The festival brought in more tourists than I’ve seen since before the pandemic. People suddenly care a lot about winter skin salves.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled around her spoon. “I’ve been wrangling deadlines and trying not to throw my laptop out the window. And Salem has entered his ‘dramatic teenager’ phase. He refuses to eat unless I personally hand-feed him shredded turkey.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice snorted. “You’re raising a prince.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, meanwhile, tilted her head. “Anything… strange happen?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused. “Besides my cat staging a hunger strike?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I mean…” Agatha hesitated, searching her words. “I don’t know. The last couple of nights—I’ve had these dreams. Not bad, just… loud. Like the veil between this world and the next has been fluttering.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “Actually… I had a weird dream, too. I think I was a kid in it and there was a woman’s voice. I couldn’t see her, but she said she loved me. That she was proud of me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, from across the kitchen, looked up sharply. “That doesn’t sound like just a dream.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze narrowed. “You think—?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda nodded slowly. “Your powers are increasing fast, Rio. Magic like that doesn’t stay quiet. You might be hearing echoes. Ancestors. Guides. Especially if it was a woman.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s throat went a little tight, spoon forgotten in her bowl. “She called me her little witch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice reached over and touched her hand, her face softening. “You okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed and nodded. “Yeah. It just… felt real. You know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned over, bumping her shoulder gently. “You should always write these down. Dreams like that? They’re never just dreams.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled at her, eyes a little glassy, but steady. “I did. The grimoire… it just kind of popped up out of thin air.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s brows arched. “Now </span>
<em>
<span>that’s</span>
</em>
<span> interesting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brow furrowed slightly, something curious sparking behind her eyes. “Wait, when did this dream happen?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio set her spoon down, the faintest hint of pink blooming in her cheeks. “Monday morning. At your place.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “At my place? And you’re just telling me now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a helpless shrug, lips tugging into a sheepish half-smile. “You were hungover and grumpy, remember?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, leaning back in her chair. “Alright, fair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And then I fell asleep again,” Rio added. “Didn’t even remember the dream until after you’d already left. I was just lying there, thinking about how I wished I had the grimoire so I could write it down, and </span>
<em>
<span>bam</span>
</em>
<span>—it dropped onto the bed next to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice choked on her stew. “Like… just appeared?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “Yeah. One second it wasn’t there, and then it was.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes sharpened, a slow, thoughtful kind of alertness washing over her. “That’s advanced magic. Responsive magic. Your grimoire’s already bonded to you more deeply than we thought.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, now lurking in the corner with her own bowl in hand, gave a low whistle. “That book is old, Rio. It doesn’t respond like that unless it truly recognizes you as its owner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked down at her hands, suddenly aware of the quiet humming beneath her skin. “It just felt… normal. Like it was supposed to be there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached for her under the table, fingers curling around Rio’s without needing to ask. “It was supposed to be there,” she said softly. “And so were you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced up at her, heart tripping a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha just kept tracing slow, lazy patterns over Rio’s skin with her thumb, quiet and steady. Like she was grounding her. Or maybe anchoring herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could feel that same warmth she’d been carrying since Monday morning—the kind that had nothing to do with the fireplace or the wine or the hot stew in her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Agatha murmured at last, voice pitched just low enough to be just between them, “next time you wake up from a prophetic dream in my bed, maybe tell me about it before three days have passed?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a look, trying to fight her smile. “I said you were hungover.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m always hungover on Mondays.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That sounds like a you problem.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That made her give Rio a playful kick under the table, and she leaned in, resting her temple briefly against Agatha’s shoulder, letting herself breathe in the scent of her again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head to rest there a moment too, and they sat like that until Wanda clapped her hands together, loud and commanding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, lovebirds. Enough brooding and pining and magical sexual tension. Finish your dinner and let’s get back to work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice groaned dramatically. “She’s like McGonagall with less chill and more wine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Less talking, more fire rune practice,” Wanda said, already moving toward the back door. “Let’s see if your aim’s gotten any better, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood, rolling her eyes, but she was smiling, a little warmth tucked beneath her ribs like a secret. She felt Agatha’s hand brush lightly over her lower back as she passed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Try not to set yourself on fire,” Agatha murmured, lips close enough to graze her ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched Rio walk ahead with Wanda and Alice, her coat flaring slightly with each step, the hem brushing the tops of her boots—and her sweater still visible under the lapels. That alone sent a jolt of something electric through Agatha’s chest, like ownership and affection and danger all wrapped in one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She lingered a beat, pretending to adjust something on the table, but really just needing the moment to catch her breath. Because gods, that girl had no idea what she did to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she finally followed them out into the snow-slicked yard behind Wanda’s house, the wards shimmered faintly overhead like they were aware of her magic, too. She felt them buzz softly at the edges of her senses—alive, alert, protective.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was already lecturing, using a stick to draw a series of defensive runes in the snow. Rio knelt nearby, brow furrowed in concentration, mirroring the lines with her finger, careful and deliberate. And Agatha… she just watched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Watched the way Rio chewed on her lower lip when she was focused. The way the runes responded to her touch—glimmering faintly like fireflies caught beneath the surface of the snow. The way she kept glancing back at Agatha when she thought no one was looking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It hit her then, quiet and sharp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was in trouble.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not because she didn’t trust Rio, or because this was happening too fast—but because for the first time in a very, very long while, Agatha Harkness was starting to believe in things she’d carefully tucked away for decades.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In warmth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In magic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the kind of connection that didn’t burn you up—but lit you up from the inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re staring,” Wanda muttered beside her, arms crossed over her chest. “And it’s disgustingly sweet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t even bother to deny it. “She’s good,” she murmured. “Really good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s herself,” Wanda said. “That’s what’s making the magic strong. Not training. Not bloodline. It’s her being seen. And letting herself be seen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. Gods, yes. That was exactly it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d never met anyone who looked at her the way Rio did. Not with awe. Not with fear. But with recognition.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like she knew her already.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like she wasn’t afraid of the dark edges.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A gust of wind swirled snow across the clearing, and Agatha tugged her coat tighter, stuffing her hands into her pockets.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t ready to say it out loud yet—not even to herself. But if the feeling in her chest was any indication, if the way Rio’s laughter caught on the wind made something inside her ache—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was probably going to say it soon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And for once, that didn’t scare her at all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stayed toward the edges of the clearing, leaning against one of the thick pines Wanda had woven a ward into ages ago. It hummed faintly with old magic—hers, Wanda’s, Eliza’s. The tree had seen so many winters and secrets and long-forgotten spells, but tonight it stood witness to something else entirely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>New magic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Across the clearing, Rio was glowing. Not literally—though Agatha wouldn’t have been surprised if she did—but in that unmistakable way someone looked when they were finally stepping into themselves. Wanda tossed out a lazy little spark of pressure and Rio caught it, eyes narrowing, fingers dancing into the defensive rune she’d just practiced.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The energy bounced off her sigil, cracking harmlessly against a tree trunk behind her. Rio blinked at her own success.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help the grin that tugged at her mouth. “That’s my girl,” she murmured before she could even think better of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice, wrapped in what looked like three different scarves and a very aggressive sweater, looked up from her spot near the fire and smirked. “Your girl, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer—just raised one brow in a way that made Alice cackle and clap her gloved hands together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was clearly trying not to smile as she addressed Rio again. “Alright, try holding it longer this time. And don’t tense up. Magic wants your intention, not your muscle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, adjusting her stance. She looked so serious, so ready, and Agatha felt her heart twist in the way it only did when something truly, unexpectedly good entered her life and she had no idea what to do with it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ten minutes later, Wanda gave a sharp nod. “That’s enough for tonight. Go warm up before one of you loses a finger.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice immediately bolted toward the house. “Yes, please. I love magic but not enough to freeze to death for it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s voice was still ringing across the clearing, sharp and exasperated—“Get your asses inside already!”—but Agatha didn’t move. Not yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached out, catching Rio gently by the sleeve before she could follow after Alice. The night air was biting, and her gloves were stuffed in her pocket, but she didn’t care. She needed this moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned toward her, expectant, the firelight flickering across her cheeks, her breath visible between them in little silver clouds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t say anything at first. She just reached for her—one hand at Rio’s waist, the other brushing her hair back, then cradling her cheek. Her thumb lingered just below her jaw.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she leaned in and kissed her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t rushed—it was claiming. Not in a possessive way, but in that quiet, resolute way Agatha had always done everything that mattered: with intention. With truth. With feeling she didn’t bother hiding anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she finally pulled back, her voice was low, velvet-wrapped and certain. “You’re mine tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, startled just a second before that slow, crooked smile curved her lips. “Is that so?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile matched it. “Mmhm.” She leaned in again, brushing her nose lightly against Rio’s, her voice soft against her skin. “I’ve missed you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could say anything back, Wanda shouted again, “I swear to the Goddess, I’m putting a freezing hex on both of you—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, finally releasing her hold, but not before stealing one last kiss. Quick. Warm. Absolutely hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They headed for the house together, and Agatha didn’t let go of her hand once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment they stepped into the cottage, Agatha made a quiet excuse to freshen up—though really, she just needed a second to breathe. She hadn’t realized how tightly her heart had been wound since that kiss in the snow. How much she’d needed to hold Rio like that again. It was ridiculous, really, the way one woman could upend her entire center of gravity in just a week.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She left Rio and Alice talking in the front room and ducked into the hallway. But just as she reached the bathroom, she caught her own name spoken in Rio’s soft voice and… paused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t polite to eavesdrop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It also wasn’t like she had much self-control when it came to Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she stood quietly, listening through the crack of the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was thinking of going back to Agatha’s,” Rio said, her voice quieter than usual, almost shy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, pressing her lips together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s voice was immediate and smug. “Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not for that,” Rio replied, and Agatha could almost hear the blush in her voice. “Just… to be with her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A slow, warm ache settled in Agatha’s chest. She closed her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Alice said, “You deserve this. And I’m really, really happy to see you like this. You’re—” A pause. “You’re glowing, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, Agatha forgot how to breathe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned lightly against the doorframe, barely making a sound. Something inside her softened—no, melted. She was used to being admired, even desired, but this was different. This wasn’t glamour or seduction or charm. This was someone seeing her and choosing her. This was Rio choosing her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even when she wasn’t in the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stayed quiet until the conversation shifted, and then moved back into the hall with careful, unhurried steps. Rio turned at her approach, her expression bright and open in that way that always made Agatha want to grab her face and kiss her senseless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, Agatha offered her arm with a casual sort of elegance and said, “Ready?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, saying a soft goodbye to Alice. Agatha didn’t say anything, but she gave Alice a brief smile, one that said thank you in a way she’d never be able to say out loud.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Back in the car, the silence was companionable. The roads were mostly clear, snow pushed to the sides like forgotten lace, and the stars above were sharp and bright through the windshield.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha drove with one hand, the other restless with memory—the curve of Rio’s waist, the warmth of her laughter, the way she’d looked in Agatha’s clothes like they’d always belonged to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the red light, the urge rose like a tide she didn’t even try to resist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached over and took Rio’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No performance, no seduction—just connection. A tether.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked over, surprised at first, but then she smiled, soft and a little sleepy. That kind of smile that cracked something open inside Agatha’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She brought Rio’s hand to her lips and pressed a kiss to her knuckles—slow, reverent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And right then, right between them, something shimmered in the dim interior of the car.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft blue light, like moonlight caught in petals.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A single blue dandelion had bloomed from the cup holder—fresh and impossible. The petals wide and glowing faintly, the stem curled delicately as if it had been waiting all this time to appear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She blinked. Felt Rio still beside her, breath catching.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither of them said a word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But between the warmth of their hands and the quiet miracle between them, something unspoken had already taken root.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it was only just beginning to bloom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stepped into the warmth of Agatha’s home, brushing snow from their coats and shaking the cold from their bones. Agatha’s wards hummed softly in greeting, sensing something different in the air—something alive and golden.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to Rio with a soft, expectant smile. “Tea? Or maybe a glass of that wine Wanda left behind. We can unwind a little…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio’s gaze was already on her—intense and aching in its focus.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just want you,” she said, quiet and clear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It hit Agatha like a spell. Not lust—though that simmered under the surface—but something heavier, sweeter. A truth she wasn’t sure she could name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her breath caught, and she took a step forward, cupping Rio’s face in both hands. Her fingers brushed along the strong lines of her jaw, the soft flush in her cheeks. She kissed her—slowly, reverently—as if the universe might fold in on itself if she didn’t do it exactly right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands found her hips, pulling her close, and they moved together like gravity had never applied to anyone else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t bother leading her to the bedroom. She simply walked them backward until the couch caught behind Rio’s knees and guided her down, sinking with her, surrounding her, holding her. They undressed each other with gentle urgency—no frantic pulling, no reckless need. Just patience. Just hunger drawn out into something holy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kissed her everywhere—temple, neck, breast, stomach—everyplace Rio had ever carried tension, doubt, pain. She kissed it all away. Her hands moved like she was learning a hymn, a prayer carved into skin and sighs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me if it’s too much,” she whispered, resting her forehead against Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not enough,” Rio breathed, voice cracking around the edges. “Don’t stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They moved together slowly, achingly, like a dance too old for music. Their breaths synced, soft moans spilling into the silence. The couch creaked under them, the fire flickered low, and the whole world narrowed to skin and touch and breath and </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This unfathomable connection between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment they reached their peak—when Agatha felt Rio fall apart beneath her, and she followed not a breath later—a thunderclap cracked above them, loud and sudden, making the walls tremble. Light exploded around them, pouring from their joined hands, their mouths, their hearts. Every inch of their bodies glowed—brilliant white-gold, then blue, then violet like the wildflowers that bloomed when they touched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room was alight with it. Pure, radiant magic, rushing from the space between their bodies as if the universe had been waiting for them to mean it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And this time, they did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t just sex—not like the times before, not even close. Those times had been desperate, beautiful, charged. But this—this was something else entirely. They were making love. Neither of them dared say the words yet, but their bodies knew. Their magic knew.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And maybe… maybe that was enough. For now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the light finally softened, fading into a candlelit hush, Agatha collapsed gently onto Rio’s chest. Her heart was thudding, her skin damp, her limbs trembling in that pleasant, aching way that only came with being undone by someone you’d tried so hard not to fall for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers threaded through her hair, and Agatha pressed a kiss to her collarbone, eyes fluttering closed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a long while, they just breathed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And in the quiet, with the storm still rolling softly overhead, Agatha let herself imagine what it might be like to keep choosing this. To wake up beside Rio every morning, to fall asleep knowing she was loved even when the words hadn’t yet been spoken aloud.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe one day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For now, this was everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stayed tangled on the couch, wrapped in the softest silence, limbs loosely intertwined and skin still humming from the aftershocks of what they’d just shared. The room smelled like sex and cedarwood, like firelight and lavender and something new—something unnamed but thick in the air between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ran her fingers lazily along the slope of Rio’s bare shoulder, watching the way the other woman’s chest rose and fell in slow, contented breaths. She didn’t want to move. Didn’t want to shift even an inch away from this moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then Rio stirred, just slightly, and murmured, “So… that was new.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh against her skin. “The thunder? Or the fact that we nearly lit my entire living room on fire?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head just enough to meet her eyes, a crooked smile forming. “Both.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled back and pressed a gentle kiss to her shoulder. “I’ve never had magic react like that before. Not like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It felt like…” Rio hesitated, searching for words. “Like the magic knew exactly what was happening. Like it was responding to… us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly. “It was. It is.” Her voice dipped into something quieter, more honest. “We’re connected. We always have been. But this—tonight—I think it was the first time we let it happen without holding anything back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled, eyes softening. “It didn’t feel scary this time. Just… right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And powerful,” Agatha added, nudging her playfully with her nose. “Very, very powerful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think we triggered a minor weather event.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know we did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They both laughed then—light and unguarded—and it felt like the perfect release. The magic might’ve cracked like thunder, but here, in the aftermath, everything was soft.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will say,” Rio murmured, “your training is seriously helping. Wanda’s too. I feel a lot more in control now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow, clearly impressed. “No accidental flower storms this week?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“None,” Rio said proudly. “Unless you count the one I caused in your damn cup holder when you held my hand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, that one was sweet,” Agatha teased. “Blue dandelions. You’re such a romantic, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned and brushed a lock of hair from Agatha’s cheek. “Couldn’t help it. You were glowing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned in and kissed her again—quick and soft and utterly irresistible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, she groaned dramatically. “Okay. As much as I’d love to stay here and risk fusing to this couch forever, we should probably move to an actual bed. You know, the thing with pillows and blankets and fewer risks of lower back pain.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh. But I like your couch,” Rio teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat up slowly, grabbing the throw blanket to wrap around her as she stood, and reached out a hand. “Come on. I’ll even let you steal my side of the bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took her hand and let herself be pulled up, stumbling slightly as they laughed their way through discarded clothing and into the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You say that like there’s a designated side already,” Rio teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There wasn’t,” Agatha said over her shoulder, “until I started imagining you in it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused just long enough in the doorway to blink at her—and Agatha caught the flicker of something in her eyes. Surprise, affection, and a little bit of that wonder she never tried too hard to hide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then they crossed into the bedroom together, bare feet on soft rugs, and the rest of the world melted away again. They didn’t rush. Didn’t need to. They just slipped beneath the covers, laughing as Agatha fought with the too-fluffy duvet and Rio shivered against the cold sheets before snuggling close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled her in, arms tight around her waist, nose buried in her hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Safe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sweet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And as the moonlight spilled silver across the room, she whispered against Rio’s temple, “You’re not just magic, you know. You’re mine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed sleepily, a smile in her voice. “Good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then they drifted off, skin warm against skin, heartbeat against heartbeat—no spells, no sparks, no thunderstorms this time. Just peace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The dream unfolded gently at first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was a child again, no older than eight or nine, her small fingers stained with crushed herbs and moss. Her mother’s voice guided her through the steps of a spell, slow and melodic, like a lullaby. They were in the woods, sunlight dappling through the canopy above, the scent of damp earth and honeysuckle sweet on the breeze. The lake nearby rippled quietly, reflecting the sky in shards of mirrored light.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora stood tall and radiant, her long dark hair braided with bits of lavender and ivy. Her hands moved with practiced ease, lighting the air with tiny sparks as she showed Agatha how to draw energy from the soil beneath their feet. “It’s not about forcing it,” she said softly. “It’s about listening. The earth will always speak to you, if you let it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Young Agatha had nodded with rapt attention, mimicking the motion of her mother’s hands, feeling the gentle pulse of something ancient and kind under her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, everything was perfect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, something shifted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The warmth drained from the light. The air thickened with silence. The child’s body was no longer her own. Agatha blinked, and when she looked down, she saw her adult hands trembling faintly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother was still there, but she was older now. Haggard. Her dress torn and damp with mud, strands of gray stark against her dark hair. Her eyes, once so calm and kind, were wild now, sharp with warning. Her hands trembled as she reached for Agatha’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nezzera,” Evanora whispered, like it was both a prayer and a curse. “It’s coming.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. “What are you talking about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We thought it was bound. We thought it was locked away.” Her voice broke, her breath ragged. “But it’s waking. The balance is shifting. You have to be ready, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ready for what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora cupped her face with both hands, pulling her close, eyes wide and filled with something that looked like fear. “You need to align. With the others. With her.” Her gaze flicked behind Agatha for a split second—toward the lake, or something beyond it. “You need control. You need each other.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heartbeat echoed in her ears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who is Nezzera?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother didn’t answer. She just pressed their foreheads together and whispered, “It’s coming. It’s coming. It’s coming.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A flash of cold wind surged through the trees. The lake darkened like spilled ink. The sound of something enormous shifting beneath the surface shattered the silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha woke with a gasp, her hand clutching the sheets, the echo of her mother’s voice still ringing in her ears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s coming.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The soft rustle of sheets and the quiet scratch of a pen pulled Rio from sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She blinked against the dim light, disoriented for a breath or two before her eyes found Agatha—sitting upright in bed, back tense, her breath quick like she’d been running. Her hair was a wild halo around her shoulders, and in her lap was a leather-bound notebook. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was writing furiously, hand moving like she was racing against time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brow furrowed. She pushed up on one elbow, her voice still rough from sleep. “Hey… what’s going on?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t look at her, just raised one hand in a quiet plea. “Just—just a second,” she murmured. “I have to get this down before it slips.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded sleepily, concern creeping beneath the haze of drowsiness. She shifted closer, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s bare shoulder. Her skin was warm but taut, like a storm had just passed through her. Rio’s fingers moved slowly, gently, tracing circles against her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She waited.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The only sound in the room was the quick scratching of pen to paper and Agatha’s still-uneven breaths.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a few minutes, Agatha finally lowered the pen and let out a long, trembling exhale. She stared at the page like it had answers she wasn’t ready for. Rio reached up, brushing a lock of hair behind Agatha’s ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you okay?” she asked softly, her voice low in the stillness between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes flicked to hers, and for the briefest second, Rio saw it—something like fear. Or awe. Maybe both.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the grimoire on her lap like it might disappear if she blinked. Her hand was still curled around the pen, knuckles pale, but she’d stopped writing. Her chest rose and fell in shallow breaths as she tried to anchor herself back in the waking world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched her closely, concern sharpening the sleep from her eyes. “Agatha?” she murmured again, sitting up fully now, hand resting warm and steady against the curve of Agatha’s back. “What happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer right away. Her gaze stayed locked on the page, as if the dream were still lingering there, echoing through the ink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, quietly—almost like it hurt to say—she spoke. “That was the first time I’ve dreamed of her in nearly twenty years.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart twisted. “Your mother?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, and the smallest tremor passed through her. “Not a memory. Not some half-dream where she’s just a shadow. This was her. I could smell the lake. I could feel the wind in the trees. She looked… like she did when I was younger. Before she disappeared.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifted closer, brushing her thumb along the base of Agatha’s spine in slow, grounding circles. “What did she say?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha drew a shaky breath. “She was teaching me magic. We were in the woods, standing near the water, and everything felt… safe. Peaceful. Like when I was a child and she’d sneak me out before dawn to collect dew for potions. I didn’t want to wake up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice broke on that last word, raw and honest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, pressing her forehead gently against Agatha’s temple, whispering, “I’m here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes. “But then she changed. Got older—worn. She looked like she’d lived through something terrible. Her hands were shaking when she took my face in them.” She paused, swallowing. “She warned me. Said something was coming. She called it Nezzera. She said we needed to be ready. That we had to align. That we needed control.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brow furrowed, the word foreign and heavy with meaning. “Have you ever heard of that before?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” Agatha let out a humorless breath. “And that terrifies me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gently took the pen from her hand and set it on the nightstand with the notebook, then opened her arms and tugged her down into the blankets. “C’mere. You don’t have to sit up alone with this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated for just a second, then let herself be pulled into Rio’s warmth. Her limbs were stiff, her breath still uneven, but Rio tucked her close, wrapping her up as if she could shield her from the dream entirely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They lay there in silence for a moment, Rio’s fingers stroking slowly through her hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re safe,” Rio murmured into the crown of her head. “Whatever it is, we’ll figure it out. Together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a breath, one that sounded more like surrender than fear, and shifted closer, burying her face in Rio’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve spent most of my life trying to forget her,” she whispered. “Trying not to need her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Rio said gently, brushing her lips over Agatha’s forehead. “But maybe now… maybe it’s time to remember. On your terms.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence again. Then Agatha exhaled, long and quiet, finally starting to melt into the curve of Rio’s body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s just stay like this,” Rio said, kissing her again. “You can tell me everything when you’re ready. But right now, just be here. With me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And slowly, breath by breath, Agatha let herself be held—past and future suspended for just a little while longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stayed still, one arm curled around Agatha’s waist, the other folded under her head as she stared into the quiet dark of the bedroom. She felt the shift when Agatha’s breathing finally slowed, when the tension that had clung to her like a second skin since waking began to melt away. The steady rise and fall of her chest, the subtle weight of her body relaxing into Rio’s — it was the only sign she needed to know she was asleep again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a long breath of her own, soft enough not to disturb her. Her forehead rested lightly against Agatha’s shoulder as her mind whirred restlessly, loud in the stillness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nezzera.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The word rang in her head like a bell tolling in the distance, a name with no shape but too much weight. She had no idea what it meant, but the way Agatha had clung to it — the way she’d shaken — made Rio’s stomach twist. Agatha, who always seemed so perfectly in control, who could summon calm with the arch of an eyebrow, had looked almost frightened when she spoke of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that scared Rio more than anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What if it was connected to that creepy folklorist who had shown up last week, all smiles and strange questions, poking around town under the guise of research? What if it had to do with the shift in her own magic — her powers that were now awake and electric under her skin, humming louder with each passing day?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was getting more used to the sensation, sure, but most of the time it still felt like walking around with a lit match pressed to her palm. Something always on the verge of flaring too bright, too fast. Even now, lying still, she could feel the soft buzz beneath her ribs. Not painful, just… restless. Like something waiting to be used.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked down at Agatha — beautiful, brilliant, powerful Agatha — and gently brushed a curl away from her cheek. She didn’t want to wake her, not after the night she’d had. But god, she wished she had answers. Or a way to fix it. Or even just a name to go with the fear sitting in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They needed to figure out what the hell Nezzera was. Before it found them first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thunder cracked low and distant, a slow roll that rattled the windows like a warning. Rio flinched. She hadn’t even realized she was holding her breath until the wind picked up outside, battering the house in sudden bursts like something was clawing at the eaves. Her stomach dropped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had taken her a minute to recognize it—this creeping sensation like the world was responding to her mood. But now that she knew, it was hard to ignore. She was spiraling, full-on panicking in the quiet dark of Agatha’s room, and the damn weather had the nerve to echo it back at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great,” she muttered, pressing the heels of her palms to her eyes. “Perfect. I’m basically a human barometer with anxiety issues.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The wind howled again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gritted her teeth and shifted a bit in bed, grounding herself with a long, slow breath. Then another. She counted them like Wanda had taught her—inhale for four, hold for four, exhale for six. Over and over. She focused on the way the sheets felt under her fingertips, the sound of Agatha’s steady breathing beside her, the warmth still lingering on the pillow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, her heart stopped trying to leap out of her chest. The wind outside began to calm. The thunder faded into silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay. Okay, better.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t even remember drifting off again. One moment she was watching the curtains settle, the next she was blinking blearily into sunlight streaming through the windows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was gone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat up slowly, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. The bed was still warm beside her, but empty. For a second, she panicked again, but then—there. The smell of coffee drifting in through the open door. The gentle clink of ceramic and glass. Agatha was downstairs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Relief spread through her like honey.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stretched, legs tangling in the covers, then padded to the wardrobe to grab whatever was closest. Her fingers found a flowy robe in a rich, floral purple that was unmistakably Agatha’s. Rio wrapped it around herself like armor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She made her way downstairs on quiet feet, the wood cool under her toes. The soft sounds from the kitchen grew louder—something sizzling faintly, the kettle clicking off, Agatha humming low and sweet under her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, the storm inside her eased for real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kitchen was warm with morning light, soft golden rays slanting through the windows and catching on the copper pans that hung above the stove. Rio stopped in the doorway, barefoot and tangled in Agatha’s robe, her breath catching the second her eyes landed on the woman standing by the counter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was murmuring quietly to Mr. Scratchy as she fed him, her voice soft, affectionate in a way she rarely used with people. Her hair was still a little tousled from sleep, curling slightly at the ends, and she wore an oversized cream sweater that slipped off one shoulder as she leaned down to scratch behind the rabbit’s ear. The gentle smile on her face was the kind Rio had only seen a handful of times—unguarded, private, real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it hit her like a freight train.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This woman. This gorgeous, impossible, powerful woman—she was hers. Not in the possessive way, not in the way you stake a claim, but in the way two people choose each other. The way the world cracks open and makes room for something too big, too bright to be ignored.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness was hers, and Rio was so stupidly, helplessly, hopelessly in love with her she could barely tell up from down anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rush of feeling was so sudden, so overwhelming that she staggered back half a step, clutching at her chest like she could physically hold the emotion in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was too much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Too much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, with a soft whoosh, half a dozen azaleas bloomed in her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Blush pink, delicate and sweet, the petals opened like tiny hearts unfurling, catching the sunlight in their folds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked down at them, stunned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned at the soft gasp, eyebrows lifting slightly when she saw her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” she said, amused, walking over slowly. “Looks like someone’s powers are feeling a little sentimental this morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just stared at her, flowers trembling in her palms, her heart aching with how much she loved her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” she whispered. “Something like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a breath—slow, deep, shaky. Her fingers curled around the stems of the azaleas, still impossibly fresh, their petals trembling with the last shiver of magic. It was almost laughable, how hard her heart was pounding, how breathless she felt over a moment that had no warning, no build-up. Just her body betraying what her heart had been screaming for days.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She crossed the kitchen in a few quiet steps, holding the small bouquet out between them like an offering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My lady,” she said, aiming for playful, but her voice was too soft, too full.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s expression shifted, her eyes going soft in that way that always made Rio feel like the only person in the world. She reached out and took the flowers with careful fingers, lifting them to her face to breathe them in. “Well, aren’t you a romantic,” she murmured, lips twitching. “Flowers before breakfast?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a half-smile, brushing her knuckles gently down Agatha’s bare arm. “Just what happens when I think too hard about you feeding your rabbit in the morning light. Apparently I’m not emotionally stable enough for that level of domestic bliss.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed under her breath, quiet and warm, before her eyes searched Rio’s face again—really searched it. “Hey,” she said softly, “how are you doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “Me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You had a front row seat to my midnight breakdown,” Agatha said, wry but tender. “I figured I should return the favor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, then let her hands find Agatha’s waist, drawing her in just a little closer. “I was more worried about you. After that dream, after what your mom said…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile dimmed slightly, but only for a breath. “I’m okay,” she said. “Still rattled. But having you there… it helped. A lot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached up, cradled Rio’s cheek with one hand, the other still holding the flowers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, just like that, she kissed her—slow and deep, a morning kiss that felt like everything. Like gratitude, like grounding, like I see you and I want you here. Her hand slid around the back of Rio’s neck, holding her close as if she couldn’t quite stand the distance of even an inch between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they parted, their foreheads rested together, breath mingling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning,” Agatha whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, finally settling into her skin. “Yeah,” she breathed. “It really is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back just enough to grab a pan off the stove, flipping something that sizzled pleasantly—eggs, maybe, or the start of an omelet. “Okay, so I’m thinking breakfast sandwiches,” she said over her shoulder. “I’ve got fresh sourdough, eggs, a little leftover kale, and I can melt that nice sharp cheddar I know you like—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved like a storm in a teacup, precise but kinetic, her robe swishing at her ankles and hair loosely pinned at the back of her head. Mr. Scratchy sat at her feet, now thoroughly fed and watching her with a kind of rabbit reverence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I’ll need to open the shop by ten. I promised Mrs. Halberg I’d restock her tinctures, and the Pendle twins are picking up that custom salve for their grandmother. Oh, and I’m almost out of valerian root, which means I’ll have to go up to Portland next week unless the supplier magically decides to restock earlier, which he never does. So that’s going to be a day trip, maybe two—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned against the counter, just watching her, the corner of her mouth twitching.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“—and we really need to talk to Wanda about the dream. About Nezzera, whatever the hell that is. I was thinking maybe tonight we could have dinner and start figuring it out? I mean, not like it’s going to be an easy Google search, and I don’t even know where to begin, but—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to grab plates and Rio moved in. With a soft, purposeful tug, she wrapped both arms around Agatha’s waist, stopping her mid-sentence. Agatha blinked, startled by the contact and the sudden stillness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in and pressed a gentle kiss to her lips, slow and grounding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Breathe,” she murmured against her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands stilled on the edge of the counter. Her body relaxed by degrees, tension leaking from her like steam. She let her forehead fall against Rio’s, her eyes slipping shut with a breath that came easier this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re right,” she said, voice quieter now. “I just… I don’t like not knowing. It makes my skin itch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled softly, fingers tracing soothing circles at the small of her back. “We’ll figure it out. One thing at a time. And if we’re having those breakfast sandwiches, I call dibs on the crispy edge of the cheddar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That earned a breathy laugh, warm and real. “Deal,” Agatha said, and for the first time that morning, she sounded like she believed it too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio kept her fingers laced with Agatha’s all the way from the house to the apothecary, and it was impossible not to feel the quiet pride swelling in her chest. She didn’t want to let go of her hand. Not just because of how warm and familiar it felt, but because it was important. Holding Agatha’s hand like this, in public, in broad daylight—it mattered. Even if it was just a sleepy Monday morning in a town that still smelled like firewood and pine needles. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It mattered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she felt the shift almost immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few people glanced their way longer than they should’ve. A man walking his dog frowned in that subtle, tight-lipped way that didn’t scream disapproval, but didn’t bother to hide it either. Two older women paused their conversation outside the bakery as they passed, their words trailing off mid-sentence. Rio caught the glance, then the quick whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t new. It wasn’t shocking. She’d grown up with this, bristled against it, learned how to steel herself against it. But something about feeling it here—in Thistle Grove, where she’d started to feel safe—hit different. It scratched under her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clearly noticed. Her thumb rubbed over the back of Rio’s hand gently, her own voice low and calm. “Ignore them,” she said without missing a step. “It’s just the usual handful of crusty homophobes. They’ve always been here. They’ll always be here. Don’t let them in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, but her eyes flicked around again. It wasn’t just the glances. There was something else. Something colder, like a shadow trailing just out of sight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t name it, but it stuck in her chest like a thorn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they reached the apothecary, Agatha pulled her into a quick kiss at the door, her hand warm at Rio’s jaw. “I’ll see you later, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded again, but she lingered, eyes flicking around the cobbled street one more time. “Yeah,” she said. “Later.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kissed her again, softer this time, then let go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once Agatha disappeared behind the green-and-gold door of the shop, Rio pulled out her phone and sent a quick text to Alice.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>meet me at the hollow? need coffee and your face. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She pocketed her phone and started walking, her boots crunching against the frosty path, the weight of the strange feeling still pressing at the base of her spine like the whisper of a storm just over the hill.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice stepped into The Hollow like she owned the place, brushing snowflakes off her coat as she scanned the tables. Rio caught her eye from the back corner and gave a small wave, already nursing her second coffee of the morning. No sign of Lilia—just the teenage girl who sometimes helped out behind the counter, earbuds in and barely sparing Rio a glance when she’d handed over the mug earlier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice made her way over with that familiar bounce in her step, dropping into the seat across from her with a little grin that said I know exactly what I’m walking into.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” she began, dragging the word out as she leaned her elbows on the table. “How was your night with the enchantress?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned. “God, don’t call her that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice just raised her brows and tilted her head, waiting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried to keep the smirk off her face but failed miserably. “It was good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmhmm. Good, she says.” Alice leaned in. “You’re glowing, you know. It’s annoying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed under her breath, cheeks burning. She wrapped her hands tighter around the warm mug, staring at the swirl of cream still settling at the top. For a second, she thought about changing the subject—about keeping this thing just for herself a little while longer. But then the words pushed up through her throat before she could stop them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love her, Al.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It came out quiet, but steady. A truth she hadn’t meant to voice out loud, but now that it was hanging there between them, she couldn’t pretend it wasn’t real. Her heart thudded hard in her chest. She lifted her eyes slowly to meet Alice’s across the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice blinked. “Oh.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a shaky smile. “Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow,” Alice said, voice softer now. “You okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a long breath. “I think so? I don’t know. It hit me this morning like a train. I was watching her feed Mr. Scratchy and I just—” she shook her head, overwhelmed at the memory, “—it felt like my chest couldn’t hold it anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s expression softened, all playfulness gone. “And what are you gonna do with all that love, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed a laugh, blinking back the ridiculous sting in her eyes. “I have no idea.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But deep down, she thought maybe she did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes prickled a little, the kind of sting that always came with being seen—really seen—by someone who knew her to the core.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice squeezed her hand again, thumb brushing gently over her knuckles. “For what it’s worth, I’m really happy for you, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, looked at her best friend, and tried not to crumble into emotional goo on the spot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice went on, softer now. “I mean it. I’ve seen you go through a lot of crap. And after stupid Carol—God, don’t get me started—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a snort despite herself. “Yeah, I still don’t know what I was thinking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You weren’t,” Alice said dryly. “You were in love with the idea of her. Not the actual self-centered trainwreck.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Harsh,” Rio said, even as a smile tugged at her lips. “But fair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But this,” Alice continued, leaning forward again, eyes lit with something more earnest now, “this is different. I knew the second I met Agatha—even if it was just over FaceTime, and she looked like she wanted to hex me for interrupting your night—that this wasn’t just a fling. She looked at you like you were the whole damn moon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath caught.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you?” Alice added, “You looked back like you finally remembered what it felt like to be wanted. Not used. Not tolerated. Wanted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had to look away for a second, swallowing around the lump in her throat. “She makes me feel like… like there’s more of me than I ever thought there was.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice smiled so softly it made something ache in Rio’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then hold on to that,” she said. “Because </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>? That’s real.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wiped quickly at her eyes, laughing under her breath as she sniffled. “God, I’m pathetic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice handed her a napkin with a gentle smirk. “You’re not pathetic. You’re in love. It’s disgusting. I’m thrilled.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That pulled another watery laugh out of her, and she leaned back in her seat, crumpling the napkin in her hand. The Hollow buzzed softly around them, the clinking of mugs and low conversation filling in the quiet spaces. It was cozy, safe—but Rio still glanced around before she spoke again, her voice softer now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve gotten used to having you here,” she said, eyes dropping to her half-empty coffee mug. “I don’t want you to go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice tilted her head with a little smile. “I’m not gone yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Rio said, then hesitated. Her fingers tightened slightly around the mug. “There’s something else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s eyebrows lifted a little, but she stayed quiet, giving her the space to keep going.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lowered her voice even more, eyes flicking around the room just to be sure no one was close enough to really hear. “Agatha had a dream last night. About her mom. It was… intense.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice leaned in. “What kind of dream?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She said she hadn’t dreamed of her in like over twenty years. But last night, her mom was there. Said something was coming. Something called Nezzera.” The name alone sent a strange tingle down her spine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice frowned, sitting back slightly. “That sounds… made up and ominous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “That’s the vibe. And the way it shook Agatha—I’ve never seen her like that. She’s always so composed. But after the dream? She looked terrified.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you don’t know what it is? This Nezzera thing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No idea,” Rio whispered, then added, “I shouldn’t even be talking about this out in the open. I just… needed to tell someone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s eyes softened. “You can always tell me. You know that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a grateful look, reaching for her hand again across the table. “I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And for a moment, in the quiet safety of her best friend’s presence, the weight in her chest didn’t feel quite so heavy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sun had barely dipped below the horizon when they gathered once again behind Wanda’s house, the clearing bathed in the silvery glow of a near-full moon. A ring of protective wards shimmered faintly at the edges of the woods, pulsing softly like a heartbeat. Snow had begun to fall again, light and slow, dusting the trees and turning the ground into a quiet canvas of white.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tugged her coat tighter as she stepped into the clearing. Alice was already curled up near the firepit, swaddled in scarves and sipping from a thermos. Agatha stood a few paces away, looking beautifully unreadable, her arms crossed and her gaze sharp as it flicked between Rio and Wanda.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was Wanda who broke the silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gloves off, Vidal,” she called, already walking toward the center of the clearing with her staff in hand. “We’re not playing around anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, caught a little off guard. “Wow, okay. Intense tonight, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped beside her, tone dry. “She’s been like this all day?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s stomach dropped. “You told her about the dream?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded once. “Had to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda didn’t even try to sugarcoat it. “A premonition from Evanora isn’t something we take lightly. If she’s warning us about something called Nezzera, and she appeared in your dream like that… well, that’s the universe telling us to get our asses moving.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So…” Rio started slowly, eyeing Wanda’s stance. “What does that mean for me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It means,” Wanda said, already rolling up her sleeves, “you’re not just learning how to defend anymore. You’re learning how to strike. If something’s coming, we’re not going to just wait around and hope it goes away. You need to be ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s right,” Agatha added quietly, her voice lower now, just for Rio. “You’ve come so far already. But I don’t think this is going to stop unless we push forward.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at them both—Wanda, crackling with unrelenting fire, and Agatha, steady and grounding beside her. Her heart was still fluttering from what she and Agatha had shared the night before, but this was different. Bigger. Scarier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, she pulled off her gloves, letting the magic at her fingertips meet the cold air like a slow-burning ember.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” she said, jaw set. “Let’s see what I’ve got.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, the training began—with more intensity than ever before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda started with sharp, focused drills—projectile deflection, burst shields, reflex enchantments. She didn’t pull her punches, sending actual kinetic pulses at Rio, who fumbled the first two but managed to throw up a barrier just in time to absorb the third. It crackled gold and green around her, flickering at the edges like it wasn’t sure what shape it wanted to take.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s better,” Wanda said with a grudging nod. “Again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They ran the sequence three more times. Rio’s form improved with each attempt, her footing more grounded, her reactions quicker. But she was breathing hard by the end, magic buzzing wild in her bloodstream.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had been quiet, watching from the edges, but now she stepped forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s enough for a moment,” she told Wanda, who didn’t argue but arched a brow like she’d be counting the seconds. Agatha turned to Rio. “You’re burning too hot. You need to learn how to pull it back in before it explodes on its own.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, still catching her breath. “I know. It feels like it’s just—always there. Right under the surface.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know the feeling,” Agatha murmured. She stepped closer, held out her hands. “Can I?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded and placed her hands in Agatha’s. A warm current immediately passed between them, steadier than before. Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut as she took a breath, centering them both.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your magic’s like a storm,” she said softly. “But storms don’t have to destroy. They can shift the air, bring rain to starving roots, wash away the rot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Poetic,” Wanda muttered in the background.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored her. “Try this,” she continued, eyes opening and locking with Rio’s. “Focus on my voice. Let the magic settle behind your ribs—not in your hands, not in your throat. Here.” She guided Rio’s hands to rest over her sternum.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio did as she said, closing her eyes, focusing on the thrum of power pulsing in her chest. She imagined it coiling, tightening, pulling back like a tide instead of crashing like a wave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Agatha whispered, her fingers brushing over Rio’s wrists. “Now, when you exhale, let it go—but only a thread. Just a flicker.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled slowly, and a faint gold glow shimmered between her palms—a soft, gentle pulse instead of the uncontrolled sparks from before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, pride blooming across her face. “There. That’s it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Damn,” Rio whispered. “I actually… did that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did,” Agatha said, squeezing her hands. “And you’re only getting stronger.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda clapped once, teasing, but firm. “Alright, golden girls. Back to business.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but stepped aside, giving Rio one last smile. “I’m not going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, they picked up again—this time, with Rio a little steadier on her feet, her power a little more her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda threw them into partnered combat drills next—nothing too serious, just a few structured sequences meant to train Rio’s reaction time and instinctual casting. And because Agatha was the best partner to push her without breaking her, Wanda handed Rio off with a wink and a “Have fun, kids,” before retreating to the other side of the garden with a glass of something suspiciously red.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched a brow as she faced Rio, drawing two short wooden staffs from the stack by the wall. “I know you’re a soft-hearted plant witch, but tonight you’re going to try and knock me on my ass.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, taking the staff. “You say that like I haven’t wanted to do that since the day we met.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, genuinely and without walls, and Rio felt the sound run through her like sunlight. “Then show me what you’ve got, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They began to spar—not with full force, but enough that it took effort, concentration. Agatha moved like a dancer, precise and sharp, and Rio did her best to match her, fueled more by instinct than training. But something had shifted. She wasn’t just reacting anymore—she was reading Agatha. Her movements, her energy. She could feel the tension in the air a second before a strike, sense the hum of magic as it shifted through her opponent’s limbs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They danced in a slow, charged circle, magic sparking faintly around their hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Focus,” Agatha murmured, her voice low. “Not just on me—on you. Don’t forget who you are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio narrowed her eyes, swept low, and caught Agatha off guard with a burst of vines that sprung up from the grass and tangled around her ankles. Agatha stumbled, and Rio grinned in victory for all of two seconds—until Agatha snapped her fingers and the vines withered into ash, and she spun Rio off balance with a flick of her wrist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They both went down—Agatha landing atop her with a grunt and a laugh, their breaths mingling in the quiet that followed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Agatha said, a little breathless. “That was mildly humiliating.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, heart pounding from more than just exertion. “You let me win.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I let you almost win.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stayed like that for a moment, the sound of the night all around them—crickets, the soft rustling of leaves, the distant hoot of an owl. Then Agatha shifted just slightly, brushing Rio’s hair from her forehead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re getting good,” she said, serious now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have good teachers,” Rio replied, smiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s voice cut through the moment like a knife. “Alright, break it up, lovebirds! Save it for after you figure out how to dodge without falling all over each other!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned and rolled off her, offering a hand to pull her up. “She’s insufferable when she’s right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took her hand, still smiling. “Guess we’ll just have to show her what we’re made of.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They got back up, dusted themselves off, and fell into position again—tired, sweaty, a little bruised, but both of them smiling in that quiet, powerful way that said we’re not done yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They ramped things up as the moon climbed higher. Wanda had insisted it was time to push Rio past her comfort zone, and Agatha—though clearly reluctant—agreed with a clipped nod.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said you wanted to be ready,” Wanda said, stretching her arms and cracking her neck. “Now you’re going to learn what it feels like to be outnumbered. We’ll take it easy on you.” Her grin was all teeth. “At first.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed, adjusting her stance. “Define easy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still breathing,” Agatha quipped, but her tone was dry, careful. She glanced at Wanda, then back at Rio. “We’ll go slow, darling. Just remember to ground yourself. You’re stronger than you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air crackled between them as both witches circled her. Wanda struck first, a wave of red magic like a whip that Rio barely dodged. Agatha followed immediately with a flick of her fingers that sent a shock of air toward her chest. Rio instinctively summoned a wall of vines, shielding herself, but they evaporated under Wanda’s next burst.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It became a dance, one Rio was just barely keeping up with. She could feel her power rising in her chest like a tide, fast and furious, and every block, every counterstrike made it surge higher.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Breathe!” Agatha called, voice sharper now. “You’re pushing too hard—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio couldn’t slow it down. Her vision blurred, her heart thudded in her ears, and when Wanda sent a stronger bolt of magic her way, Rio didn’t even think. She threw both hands forward, screaming inside with the force of it, and a pulse of magic erupted from her like a wave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t just wind. It wasn’t just light.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was raw power.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Both Agatha and Wanda were thrown back—Agatha managing to shield herself mid-air, but Wanda hit the ground hard and rolled to a stop, groaning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda!” Agatha cried, already on her knees beside her best friend, magic glowing golden and immediate as she pressed her hands gently over Wanda’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart plummeted. “Oh my God. I—I didn’t mean to—” She sprinted over, falling to her knees across from Agatha. “I didn’t know it would hit that hard. Is she—?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine,” Wanda said, breathless but smirking through a wince. “Just a little crispy around the edges. Someone’s been eating her magical Wheaties.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the joke didn’t land for Rio. Her hands were shaking. She stared at the small burn on Wanda’s shoulder, at the way Agatha’s magic stitched it back together with soft light.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m so sorry,” she whispered. “I didn’t—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did,” Agatha said, her voice gentle but steady. “And that’s good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, stunned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not going to learn how to control it by being afraid of it,” Agatha said, her fingers never faltering as she worked. “You reacted to danger. You protected yourself. It wasn’t perfect—but it was powerful. And next time, it’ll be better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda gave her a crooked grin. “Besides, if I had a nickel for every time I’ve been knocked on my ass by a young witch coming into her own, I’d have a whole damn coin purse.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed a laugh, still shaken. “You should’ve warned me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We did,” Agatha and Wanda said in unison, then exchanged a look and rolled their eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat back on her heels, exhaling slowly. She could still feel the power in her fingertips, buzzing like electricity under her skin. But now it came with something else too—a flicker of confidence. Of control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha touched her hand, just briefly, grounding her. “We’ll figure it out together. Okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, finally letting herself believe it. “Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda flexed her newly-healed shoulder, rotating it with an audible pop. “Well,” she said, dragging herself to her feet with a grunt, “that was bracing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her, wide-eyed. “You want to keep going?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda flashed her a wicked grin. “Damn right I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda,” Agatha chided softly, though there was no real heat behind it. She helped Rio stand, brushing dirt from her arm with gentle fingers. “Maybe we should give her a minute—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope.” Wanda cracked her knuckles and rolled her neck, already back in stance. “She’s fine. Look at her—she’s buzzing like a live wire. The best way to learn is to do. And she needs to know she can land a hit without falling apart about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked at her. “You literally just got blown off your feet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Which means,” Wanda said with an exaggerated shrug, “I better learn how to dodge faster.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at Rio, brow lifted in silent question.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a long breath, fingers twitching as magic stirred inside her again. “Alright. Let’s go again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda grinned. “Now that’s the spirit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda lit the last of the candles on the kitchen table with a snap of her fingers, their golden glow flickering across the mismatched plates and bowls of charcuterie she’d thrown together—fig jam, rosemary crackers, slices of smoked gouda and Manchego, a pile of prosciutto, and olives glistening in oil and herbs. The wine was already flowing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat cross-legged at one end of the table, her elbow resting on the wood, fingers curled around a glass of red. Her eyes were distant, a crease between her brows as she swirled the wine but didn’t drink it. Rio sat beside her, still quietly buzzing from the training, her knees bruised and her power faintly pulsing under her skin like a restless tide. Wanda, across from them, looked the most relaxed of the three—even with a faint scuff mark on her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Wanda said after a long sip of her wine, “Nezzera.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The word settled over the table like a shadow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finally took a sip, then nodded. “That’s what she said. My mother. In my dream. It didn’t feel like a memory—it felt like a warning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’ve never heard that word before?” Wanda asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Never.” Agatha’s voice was low, almost hesitant. “I checked every single magic book I own. Every single page of my Grimoire. Nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned forward, her voice soft. “Could it be older than what’s recorded? Something suppressed, or forgotten on purpose?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s eyes narrowed slightly in thought. “Wouldn’t be the first time. The Watchers have a habit of sweeping the dangerous stuff under the rug, especially if it didn’t suit their tidy narratives.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips pressed into a tight line. “My mother told me we needed to align. That we needed control. That it’s coming.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s more than a warning,” Wanda said. “That’s a countdown.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached for a slice of bread, mostly to have something to do with her hands. “So how do we figure out what it is before it shows up at our doorstep?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at Wanda, then back at Rio. “We dig. We start with the Archives, and the personal grimoires of the Threads. We should talk to Lilia about access to the magic Archives. If this thing has a history, we’ll find it. And if not…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We start writing our own,” Wanda said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly. “Exactly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised her glass, her hand steady despite everything swirling inside her. “To digging up ghosts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda smirked and clinked her glass against Rio’s. “To blowing them up if we have to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s glass met theirs last, her smile soft, touched with something fierce. “To not facing any of it alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They drank to that—quietly, reverently. The warmth of wine filled Rio’s chest, but it was the shared glances, the strength of the moment, that truly grounded her. She looked between the two witches across the table and felt a quiet sense of awe. These weren’t just powerful women. They were hers. Her people now. Her strange, terrifying, brilliant family.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha walked between Rio and Alice as they made their way up the small stairs of the sagging porch of the cottage, the old wood creaking under their weight. The moon was high, casting everything in a pale glow that softened edges and made the world feel suspended in something dreamlike. Rio’s hand brushed against hers now and then, a gentle touch that grounded her, made her remember that not everything had to feel like a warning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice let out a stretch and a yawn so exaggerated it had to be performative. “As much as I’d love to continue our magical group therapy, I’ve got a thing tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched a brow. “A thing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A date,” Alice said with a grin. “Well. Potential date.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned to her, skeptical. “With who? The only people under fifty and older than 25 in this town are us and that goth barista who clearly hates everyone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice laughed and fished her phone out of her jacket. “Matched with her when I got to town. She just texted to meet up at the Silver Mare.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned the phone toward them, and Agatha squinted at the screen. A striking Black woman with a shaved head smiled out at them, all confidence and charm. She wore a sleek leather jacket, tattoos inked delicately along her collarbone, and held a glass of whiskey with an effortless kind of cool. Underneath her picture: Dr. Jennifer Kale.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s jaw dropped. “No way. That’s Salem’s vet!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help the smirk that curled her lips. “Jennifer Kale. She’s brilliant. And intense.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice pocketed her phone with a shrug. “She’s hot, smart, has opinions, and she asked me out. I’d be stupid not to go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled. “Well, if you disappear into the woods never to be heard from again, we’ll know who to question.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll send my location,” Alice said, already halfway down the walk. “Don’t wait up!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They watched her go, the air falling into a soft hush around them. Agatha could still feel Rio’s hand in hers, warm and steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time they reached the cottage, the moon was high and the sky scattered with stars, the air smelling like pine and woodsmoke. Agatha unlocked the door and pushed it open, the familiar creak of old hinges welcoming them home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio slipped past her with slow, dragging steps, shoulders a little hunched, eyes rimmed with exhaustion. Salem darted in behind them, letting out a chirp of greeting before disappearing into the living room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to speak, but Rio beat her to it with a sleepy murmur.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Babe… I know we talked about tea and cozying up, but I think I’m gonna have to take a raincheck. I’m so wiped, I don’t even know what dimension I’m in anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s expression softened. “Of course, darling. Go to bed. I’ll be right behind you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio offered a grateful little smile and kissed Agatha’s cheek, already shrugging out of her hoodie as she made her way toward the stairs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her go—her usually vibrant energy dulled to embers—and felt a tug in her chest. She was proud of how far Rio had come, how fiercely she threw herself into her training, but she couldn’t help the faint undercurrent of worry that pulsed beneath it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved through the motions of locking up the house, feeding Salem, extinguishing the candles with a flick of her fingers. Then she followed Rio upstairs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time she reached the bedroom, Rio was already under the covers, curled up on her side. One arm flung across the pillow, hair a dark tumble around her face. She was already half-asleep, blinking slowly as Agatha slid into bed behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed a kiss to the back of her shoulder, then draped an arm over her waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Goodnight, my darling,” she whispered, even though she wasn’t sure Rio could hear it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The only response was a sleepy little sigh and the relaxing of muscle against her body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes and let herself fall into the quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sunlight filtered through the gauzy curtains, painting soft gold across the white sheets. Agatha stirred slowly, blinking herself awake to the sound of birdsong and the gentle shifting of the woman beside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had turned onto her back in her sleep, the duvet pulled down around her waist, her tank top slightly askew.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was then that Agatha saw it—faint shadows of bruises blooming along Rio’s ribs and the edge of her shoulder, half-hidden by the cotton fabric.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart caught.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Carefully, so as not to wake her, she sat up and gently brushed the strap of Rio’s tank top aside. The marks were clearly from the night before—likely when Wanda had pushed her to her limits, and Agatha had been too caught up in the moment to notice how much Rio had taken on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached out and traced the edge of a bruise with trembling fingers, the glow of healing magic already flickering to life in her palm. Rio stirred under the touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re hurt,” Agatha said softly, brows drawn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked at her, eyes still bleary. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted so she was leaning over her properly now, letting her hand hover over one bruise. “You didn’t feel this last night?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked down and winced, reaching to touch her own side. “Oh. </span>
<em>
<span>Damn</span>
</em>
<span>. I didn’t even realize. I was running on so much adrenaline, I guess I didn’t notice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, pressing her palm gently to Rio’s skin. “You don’t always have to be the strongest one in the room, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a sheepish smile, leaning into the warmth. “I kinda do when I’m being double teamed by two witches who’ve been practicing magic since they were in diapers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That made Agatha chuckle in spite of herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t regret it,” Rio said softly. “I need to be ready. Whatever this Nezzera thing is—we can’t afford to be sloppy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sobered again, the healing magic flowing quietly beneath her skin. “No. We can’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She bent down and kissed the center of a fading bruise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But I still need you in one piece, love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes. “I’m not going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s magic flowed steady and golden through her fingertips, gentle as it sunk into Rio’s bruises. She watched them fade, the dark patches softening into nothingness, skin healing beneath her touch. But even after the last one disappeared, she didn’t pull her hand away. Her fingers lingered, warm and light along Rio’s ribs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t even say anything,” Agatha murmured. “You let me walk around all night like I hadn’t noticed you were hurting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a low breath, eyes still half-lidded against the morning light. “Didn’t feel it at the time. Adrenaline, maybe. Power. I don’t know. I just wanted to be good enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s throat tightened. “You are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her then, really looked, and something in her expression softened. Agatha felt it like a wave, the tenderness, the unspoken things hanging in the space between them. It made her want to kiss her and hold her and never let her go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she did. She leaned in and kissed Rio—slow and full of meaning, the kind of kiss that spoke all the things they hadn’t said aloud. Rio responded with a sigh against her mouth, fingers slipping up into Agatha’s hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kiss deepened with quiet urgency, their bodies moving closer like they couldn’t help it. Clothes were pushed away in lazy motions, not rushed but inevitable, and soon they were skin to skin beneath the covers, all warm lines and breathless touches.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved over her with reverence, like Rio was something rare and holy. Every kiss, every slow roll of her hips, was a vow she couldn’t quite name yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gasped, pulling her closer. “Don’t stop,” she whispered, and Agatha never would—not for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They moved together with an aching sweetness, like it wasn’t just want anymore, but something deeper, fuller. Something they hadn’t dared name but could feel in every brush of fingers, every shared breath, every trembling moment where the world narrowed to just this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they reached that peak together, Agatha cried out into the curve of Rio’s neck, her magic sparking out in light. She felt Rio do the same, a bright, blinding moment of connection. A crack of thunder echoed distantly overhead—just one. As if the world itself had acknowledged what had happened between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not just sex. Not even just magic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Afterward, Agatha lay tangled against her, heart still racing, fingers tracing idle patterns across Rio’s stomach. Rio’s hand was in her hair again, slow and soothing, and they didn’t speak for a long time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was Rio who broke the silence first, her voice low and a little hoarse. “I don’t know what we’re doing,” she said. “But I know I don’t want it to stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted her head just enough to look at her. “Me neither.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned in, kissed the corner of Rio’s mouth, and let herself linger there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither of them said the words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the air was thick with them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Agatha emerged from the shower, dressed in one of Rio’s soft vintage tees knotted at the waist and a pair of borrowed jeans that fit almost indecently well, the smell of vanilla and cinnamon had filled the entire cottage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The scent hit her like a spell the moment she stepped into the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was at the stove, flipping golden pancakes like it was second nature, hair still damp and curling around her ears, wearing nothing but boyshorts and a robe that barely stayed closed. She turned and gave Agatha a wicked little grin over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hope you’re hungry,” Rio said. “I’ve earned the right to gloat a little.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, a fond smile playing on her lips. “Oh, you absolutely have. That was… incredible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes twinkled as she slid a pancake onto the growing stack. “Well. I aim to please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Salem wove between Agatha’s ankles with a delicate mewl, tail flicking. She reached down and scratched him behind the ears, earning a pleased purr.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment was quiet and full of ease, and Agatha felt it settle into her bones. She hadn’t known how badly she’d needed this—domesticity, intimacy, warmth. She hadn’t dared imagine it could be this easy with someone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then the front door creaked open, and Alice breezed in wearing the same clothes from the night before, hair a bit mussed, and lipstick a little smudged. She looked far too smug for someone who clearly hadn’t slept.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning, sapphics!” she announced, flopping into a chair like she owned the place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed. “Alice. Subtle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stole a kiss from Rio as she passed her, just a soft press of lips that made Rio’s ears flush red and her knees go a little weak. Then she sat down beside Alice, snatching a piece of sliced banana from the counter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice waggled her brows at her. “You look suspiciously glowy, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow, but her smirk betrayed her. “So do you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice gave an exaggerated shrug. “Listen, I don’t want to brag but Salem’s local vet? Knows her way around more than just animals.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio choked on a laugh, tossing a dishtowel in her best friend’s direction. “Gross.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha just grinned into her coffee mug. “I like her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice beamed. “She likes you too. Though I warned her about the two of you being absolutely insufferable when you’re in the same room.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finally brought over a plate stacked with pancakes, set it in front of Agatha with a dramatic flourish, and gave her a look that was somewhere between adoring and exasperated. “You’re lucky you’re hot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned in and murmured, “You keep making me pancakes, I’ll let you call me lucky forever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blushed again, and Alice made a gagging noise. Salem, unfazed, hopped up onto the windowsill to bathe in the morning sun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was cozy and ridiculous and so stupidly perfect that for a moment, Agatha forgot the looming shadow of that dream, forgot the word Nezzera, forgot the weight that came with being a Thread.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Right now, there were pancakes, coffee, and the woman that made her world spin completely out of control with how much she loved her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d take the peace where she could.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lingered longer than she should at the breakfast table, caught between the warmth of the food, the laughter, and the way Rio’s eyes crinkled when she smiled. But the clock ticked ever onward, and the apothecary wasn’t going to open itself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I really do have to go,” she murmured, even as her body made no move to leave. Salem pawed lazily at the hem of her shirt like even he disapproved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio walked her to the door, her hand brushing lightly against the small of her back, and Agatha leaned into the touch instinctively. They paused on the threshold—just a few steps from the front porch, with sunlight cutting soft golden lines between the trees.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to face her, already tilting in for a kiss, and when Rio met her lips it was slow and aching and far too short. She felt it all the way down to her toes, like the warmth of a spell casting itself inside her ribcage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they pulled apart, Rio looked dazed in the prettiest way, her lips parted like she still had something left to say.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, she said it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was so soft, Agatha almost missed it. But it landed like thunder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, visibly startled that the words had actually left her mouth, like some part of her brain hadn’t caught up with her heart. She opened her mouth again, as if to take it back or soften it, but Agatha didn’t let her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she kissed her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Really kissed her—deep and searching, her hands in Rio’s curls, her whole body pressing close like maybe if they stayed like this, time would stop spinning so damn fast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally broke apart, Agatha stayed close, forehead pressed to Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you too,” she breathed, barely above a whisper. “So much I don’t even know what to do with myself anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stood there like that, wrapped in silence and each other, until the air shimmered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t just the air, though.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They didn’t notice it at first—not until Rio gasped and pulled back slightly, eyes wide as she glanced over Agatha’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The porch—Rio’s poor, sagging, weather-beaten porch—was no longer sagging. No longer cracked and leaning. The wood looked freshly sanded and stained, the railings smooth and polished, each slat perfectly placed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then the flowers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Azaleas. Clematis. Wisteria. Blooms of every shade curled over the posts and beams like they had grown there for decades, full and vibrant, humming with unseen magic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god,” Rio whispered, her fingers curled lightly around Agatha’s wrist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t say anything at first. Her throat felt thick. Her heart thundered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The magic wasn’t just responding to Rio’s power—it was responding to them. To their love. Their truth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Agatha finally said, her voice quiet and thick with emotion, “that’s new.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a breathless laugh, both of them still in awe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached down and linked their fingers, grounding herself in the touch. She didn’t care that she was late anymore. She’d never felt more present than she did in this moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Magic was real. Love was real. And she wasn’t afraid anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They lingered on the porch, reluctant to pull away. The winter morning was crisp, breath visible in soft clouds between kisses. The air held that clean, cold scent that always followed an overnight frost, and yet everything around them—especially the porch now blooming with enchanted life—felt impossibly warm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I really have to go,” Agatha said, voice low, her gloved hand still wrapped in Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You do,” Rio whispered, though neither of them moved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her one last, lingering kiss, slow and warm against the chill, then finally forced herself to step back. As she walked down the steps, she felt the faint crunch of frost-softened boards beneath her boots—new wood, still faintly warm from magic. A ribbon of white ivy curled around the railing as if it had always been there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked back one last time—Rio standing there in a hoodie and flannel pants, hair messy, eyes soft—and then she got in her car and headed into town.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The drive was slow. A light dusting of snow still clung to the edges of the road, and the trees were bare and skeletal, reaching long fingers across the sky. The holiday lights strung up along Main Street flickered to life even though it was barely mid-morning—silver stars and warm golden orbs wrapped around lamp posts like a greeting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha parked just outside the flower shop—she had promised Lilia she’d pick up some dried winter roses—and pulled her coat tighter around herself as she stepped out. The cold bit at her cheeks, but she barely noticed. She still felt warm, her chest full of something heavy and bright and terrifyingly lovely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was halfway across the sidewalk when—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, well,” came the unmistakable voice of Sharon Davis, her breath fogging slightly as she approached in a long charcoal coat and red scarf. “If it isn’t Agatha Harkness, glowing like she’s walked straight out of a Christmas card.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, momentarily caught off-guard. “Mayor Davis. Morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmhmm,” Sharon said, hands tucked neatly in her coat pockets as she took in Agatha’s flushed cheeks and almost dreamy expression. “You’ve got that look. You know the one. Like someone just gave you exactly what you didn’t know you needed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to school her face into something neutral, but it was impossible. Her lips curled in that stupid, genuine smile that kept happening lately. “It’s been… a good morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll bet it has,” Sharon said knowingly. “Didn’t think I’d see the day, but… I’ve got to say, it suits you. Happy looks good on you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down briefly, adjusting her scarf like it might hide the feeling brimming in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” she said, quieter than she meant to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t thank me,” Sharon replied, already moving toward the town hall. “Just hold onto it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood for a moment as the cold nipped at her cheeks, her breath curling in the air. Snow started to fall again—light flurries that dusted the street like powdered sugar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached into her coat pocket, pulled out her phone, and texted Rio:</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>you’re trouble. magical, wonderful trouble.</span>
</em>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>also, i miss you already.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Then she shoved her hands back into her pockets and walked toward her shop, heart beating so loud it drowned out the bells jingling overhead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had barely turned the sign to OPEN and started sorting out the stock behind the counter when the bell above the door rang.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t glance up at first—customer traffic this time of year usually meant holiday colds and last-minute herbal remedies—but something about the silence that followed made her pause.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No idle chatter. No curious footsteps. Just stillness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then a voice: calm, crisp, familiar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello again, Ms. Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her breath caught.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked up slowly—and there she was. Mara Greaves. Standing just inside the doorway like she belonged there, dressed in that sleek black coat and burgundy gloves, speckled with melted snow. Her silver-blonde braid was tucked neatly over one shoulder, and her expression held the same too-knowing calm it had during their last encounter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Here. In her shop. Again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha offered a practiced, polite smile. “Dr. Greaves. Back so soon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mara tilted her head slightly. “I never did finish browsing. And this time of year? Well… there’s always something to find in an old place like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t move from behind the counter, though she felt every hair on the back of her neck prickle. “Looking for anything in particular? Oils? Tinctures?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Insight,” Mara said simply, stepping farther into the shop and brushing her fingertips across a hanging bundle of dried thyme. “This town is layered, you know. History isn’t just in books—it’s in walls. In blood.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile didn’t waver. “Sounds like something a folklorist would say.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mara’s eyes glittered with amusement. “That’s what I am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right,” Agatha murmured. “A folklorist.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a beat of silence. Then:</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s learning quickly,” Mara said, voice softer now. “The girl. Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t blink. “She’s none of your business.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m simply observing,” Mara replied, her gaze drifting to the dusty shelf of protective stones. “But you’re guiding her. Preparing her. That’s always been your role, hasn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile thinned. “You must have me confused with someone else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Mara said, voice almost gentle. “I don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That did it. Agatha stepped out from behind the counter, her posture casual, but her energy humming just beneath the surface.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said you were here to research stories,” she said. “Buy some herbs. Drink some tea. I suggest you stick to that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mara gave a faint, almost approving smile. “You’re good at this. The pretending.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw clenched. “This conversation is over.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure you believe that,” Mara said, turning slowly toward the door. “But you know what’s coming. You felt it the moment the name was spoken.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mara glanced back once, her eyes sharp. “Not everything buried stays asleep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she walked out, the bell over the door jingling like nothing had happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood there for a moment, the silence stretching long and heavy around her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she reached for her phone and texted Wanda first.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>she was here again. she brought up rio. she knows something. maybe more than she’s letting on.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Then another message to Rio, right after:</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>hey, love. everything okay? let me know when you’re free.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Because whatever this was? It wasn’t over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not even close.</span>
