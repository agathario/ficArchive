      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>“Oh my god,” Billy says, and when Rio glances up, they’re all staring at her: Billy, Eddie, Alice, Jen. “You and Agatha went on a date.”</p><p>Rio scoffs. “It wasn’t a date. It was just dinner.”</p><p>“So you just rolled out of bed and let her buy you an expensive dinner?” Jen says, which makes Alice snort.</p><p>“Sounds like you have a sugar mama,” Alice says. “I guess that’s one way of surviving academia.” They all laugh, and Alice raises her water glass to salute Rio. “No judgment,” she adds. “I would kill for a hot older professor buying me dinner and helping me with my writing.”</p><p>-</p><p>Rio's POV.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>again, i'm completely blown away by the response to my first foray into agatha/rio! thank you all for your lovely comments, i had no idea this would resonate to this degree but i'm so happy you like it. 🖤</p></blockquote>

      <p><em>wow, agatha harkness is HOT </em>🔥🔥, Rio texts Jen. Surreptitiously, keeping her phone in her lap, so that Professor Harkness doesn’t notice.</p><p>From across the table, Jen raises a judgemental eyebrow. <em>whatever</em>, she texts back, not seeming to care if anyone sees that she’s not paying attention to the presentation or not. <em>remember that workshop I went to last year, in pennsylvania? she was one of the teachers and she didn’t even bother to read half the papers</em></p><p>A second later, a follow-up text arrives:</p><p>
  <em>and bev took one of her courses and she was a terrible teacher. called all the students lazy idiots once. didn’t reply to emails in ages and then wrote back like a thumbs up</em>
</p><p><em>well, apparently she was very busy being very hot!! </em>Rio returns, netting herself another of Jen’s trademark judgmental looks. But she only catches it in the corner of her eye, too busy gazing at Agatha at the head of the table. She’s a legend in the field and while the talk is interesting, Rio is more than a little distracted by the speaker herself.</p><p>Of course, she had been distantly aware of Agatha Harkness since before the symposium – she is, after all, an integral part of Rio’s literature review and a brilliant researcher. And Rio had, after surfing around on the university web when she first begun, in fact asked her supervisor if it would be a good idea to bring in Professor Harkness as a secondary supervisor. Lilia had said flat out no, citing Agatha’s flightiness and lax dedication to commitments, but Rio had suspected there was something more, some personal vendetta, under the surface.</p><p>She watches Agatha, chin in hand, intrigued by her way of moving her hands as she speaks, her casual confidence in front of her audience, not to mention her <em>ass </em>in those high-waisted slacks.</p><p>Rio’s, like, 90 percent certain Agatha Harkness is a lesbian. By god, she <em>hopes</em> Agatha Harkness is a lesbian.</p><p><em>omg</em>, Jen writes, <em>PLEASE don’t get drunk and fuck the awful professor</em></p><p><em>don’t worry</em>, Rio replies. <em>I won’t</em></p><p> </p><p>She keeps her word; by the time they’re headed to Agatha’s hotel room, Rio’s only had about one and a half glasses of wine. There is a pleasant looseness to her, a warmth in her blood, but she’s all there, in the moment, well aware of what she’s doing.</p><p>The hotel door closes behind them and Rio pushes Agatha up against it, deepens the kiss again, cupping Agatha’s face and makes her moan as their tongues slide together. She reaches up, blindly, and pulls the tie from Agatha’s insane mane of hair, leaving it to tumble down across her shoulders, pushes in close, chest to chest, a thigh wedged between Agatha’s legs, the mingled scent of Agatha’s skin and expensive perfume heavy in her nose.</p><p>It’s desperate and frantic, Agatha’s breath loud and fast in Rio’s ear, her head falling back to allow Rio to kiss her throat, her pulse thundering under Rio’s lips, arching into the touch of Rio’s hands upon her waist.</p><p>They don’t waste any time undressing. Rio quickly divests herself of her T-shirt before starting in on the billion little buttons on Agatha’s shirt, closed all the way to her throat. Very sexy, but now they make Rio curse under her breath, fingers clumsy with impatience and lust, while Agatha scrambles at Rio’s jeans, pulling down her fly and pushing them off down her hips, fingertips dragging, exploring, across the ink on Rio’s thighs.</p><p>“Wow,” Rio says, stupidly, when Agatha’s finally down to her underwear, black and purple lace against her creamy skin. All of a sudden, she <em>feels</em> drunk; she wants to bite at her, touch her all over – the flare of her hips, the softness of her stomach, her phenomenal tits, the curve of her ass. There is nothing taut or girlish about her – she’s all woman, showing her age in the lines of her skin and the soft padding of her flesh, and the sight of her drives Rio <em>crazy</em>.</p><p>She can feel Agatha’s gaze on her, looking in return, an interested glint in her eyes at the sight of the tattoos, the black ink covering about a third of Rio’s body, as they come together once more, stumbling their way across the room to the bed, mouths locked together. Agatha’s skin is warm and smooth beneath Rio’s hands, her hands eager upon Rio in return, following a tendril of ink down her shoulder, first with her fingertips, then with her lips, sighing into Rio’s skin.</p><p>Rio bites down, sucks the soft, fragile skin of Agatha’s throat into her mouth, feels a deep throb of satisfaction at the thought of leaving a mark there. Agatha moans and tilts her head, tacitly asking for more.</p><p>In the seminar room, Agatha Harkness had been a force of nature – standing there casually, with her hands in her pockets, sounding like she was delivering a lecture to a group of slightly dumb teenagers rather than giving a talk to her peers. Rio had thought then that she had a sexy voice, deep and a little nasal, an intriguing edge to her vocal fry, and she’s delighted to find out that it seems to carry over into her sounds of pleasure, that she’s vocal in bed.</p><p>Rio rolls on top of her, pushing her down into the mattress with her weight, and kisses her deeply, putting her hands against the softness of the inside of her thighs to spread her legs around her. She can feel Agatha shudder in response, eyes going a little wide – back arching, in a figurative showing of the throat. A slow, thrilling beat of pure want pulses through Rio. <em>Okay then</em>, she thinks, arousal pounding in her veins.</p><p>By the time she’s three fingers deep inside Agatha, face buried in her amazing tits, she has learned that Agatha is not so much submissive in bed as she is demanding – happy to hand over control, as long as she gets exactly what she wants in return. All too happy to comply, Rio watches, entranced, as Agatha’s cunt takes her fingers, groans at the feel of her tight, wet heat, the clenching evidence of her pleasure as Rio hits that spot inside her that makes Agatha moan, tightly rubbing her fingers against that ridge of flesh.</p><p>“Fuck, I wanna eat you out,” Rio pants. Watching her own fingers pumping in and out of Agatha’s beautiful pussy is suddenly not enough – she wants to devour her, disappear into her in more ways than one.</p><p>But in response, Agatha reaches down, breathing heavily, cheeks flushed with desire. Her hand goes around Rio’s wrist to hold her in place, forcefully fucking herself on her fingers, body undulating against Rio, tits moving hypnotically, her nipples rock hard and her eyes squeezed shut from pleasure.</p><p>“I want to come like this,” Agatha pants. “With you inside me.”</p><p>At that, Rio’s teeth bite hard into the flesh of her own lower lip. “Okay,” she says dumbly, almost breathlessly, mouth dry, eyes drinking Agatha in. She lets her thumb circle more purposefully against Agatha’s clit, Agatha’s fingers still digging into the bones of her wrist, a slight spot of pain both grounding and utterly erotic. “Okay, whatever you want.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth falls open on a silent moan, body bowing on the bed as she comes. Her hand goes out, searching, and grabs hold of Rio, pulls her down onto her and kisses her, hard, bites down on her bottom lip as she trembles violently from her orgasm until, finally, she relaxes, slumping back to the bed, her grip loosening.</p><p>Rio lies down next to, presses her body close to Agatha’s, bends down to kiss her shoulder, her collarbone, and her breast. One hand lazily circles the other breast, softly, even as she feels the clench of need in her own body.</p><p>Agatha opens her eyes, reaches up to kiss Rio as she slides a hand in between Rio’s legs. She moans against Agatha’s mouth as Agatha finds her way, rubs languidly at Rio’s clit. Rio sighs and lets a hand slide down Agatha’s side, over her ribs and her hips, down to her thigh. It’s not going to take long, she thinks – she can already feel the tell-tale tensing in her thighs, the flare of heat in the low of her belly, her hips, her cunt throbbing.</p><p>Cupping her hand around Agatha’s neck, she pulls her in closely again, kisses her, moans into her mouth. Agatha lifts her leg and places it on Rio’s knee, opening herself up to her again. Immediately, Rio slides two fingers into her wetness, making Agatha groan, low and guttural in her throat. Soon, she is utterly distracted, more caught up in rolling her hips down on Rio’s fingers than on Rio’s pleasure, but it doesn’t matter – within minutes Rio shudders and comes, Agatha clenching down hard on her fingers, her moan loud in Rio’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t get back to the university until Monday morning, spending the weekend with her family in New York. It was supposed to be a small thing, only Rio and her parents, but as she arrives Friday afternoon her sisters are already there with their own families in tow and less than five seconds in the door, Rio can see all the uninterrupted hours of work she’d banked on evaporate before her eyes like a mirage.</p><p>“Ah, you’re so studious, you’ll have it done in no time!” her mother tells her, waving it away, when Rio complains about the ambush.</p><p>There isn’t much to do but to grit her teeth and accept defeat. In order to keep sane, she sneaks out late on Saturday night to hook-up with a girl she’s matched with on Tinder. It’s fun, a welcome reprieve, but nothing like the electrifying night she’d spent with Agatha and she leaves the girl’s apartment almost as keyed up as she arrived.</p><p>She had planned to write on the flight back, but once she’s finally in the seat, laptop open in front of her, her mind goes completely blank. She sighs, tries to read through her last few paragraphs to see if anything sparks. When that doesn’t work, she goes through her sources, tries to find some inspiration. That, in turn, leads her to start surfing around the databases, trying to see if she can scare up something that would help her out of whatever hole she’s  fallen into.</p><p><em>That</em> somehow leads her to the university webpage and Agatha’s profile. She’d already been on it, of course, looking through her publications to see what she could use for her own work. It’s a good picture, she thinks as she looks at it, Agatha glaring into the camera, half slouched in front of a stone wall, her hands in her pockets.</p><p>Chewing at the edge of a nail, she thinks of Agatha in bed, spread out beneath her, and, later, leaned against the desk, thighs eagerly parting to allow Rio in. She thinks about the taste of her pussy, the noises she made when Rio had her way with her, the sight of her naked in bed beside Rio, the feel of her body pressed close.</p><p>With a few impatient clicks, Rio brings up the university employee handbook. After a couple of minutes of intense keyword searching, she concludes that there is nothing in there that will make Agatha end up in official trouble because of their tryst.</p><p>She clicks back to Agatha’s profile for a second, then closes the browser window and goes back to her dissertation document, stares at the cursor blinking against the digital page, as white and blank as untrodden snow.</p><p> </p><p>She stays up until 2:00 AM on Sunday, trying to get something out for her supervisor. At 2:07 she blindly sends it off and goes to sleep.</p><p>Her alarm rings at 6:30; she has an 8:30 class to TA and after that a long day of marking. She’s like a zombie all day, chugging coffee and energy drink to keep going. It backfires, turns her from sluggish to almost vibrating out of her skin during the afternoon, body thrumming with caffeine, lack of sleep, and pent-up frustration.</p><p>She can’t seem to get Agatha Harkness out of her mind either. At lunch, she sees her all the way across the cafeteria, picking up a salad and a mineral water. She’s dressed in a pair of wide slacks and a blazer, hair down. Looking really good, Rio thinks, letting her gaze hungrily follow Agatha as she pays and leaves.</p><p>She gets herself a cup of coffee and a bag of Twizzlers and goes back to her shared office to keep marking essays, putting on her earphones to drown out her office mates’ keyboard tapping. Somewhere around 4 PM she realizes that she has not retained a single word she’s read of the last three essays and groans out loud.</p><p>Braindead but with her body whirring with artificial energy, she lets her baser urges take charge. Chewing on her final Twizzler she goes back to the university webpage, to Agatha’s profile, and makes a mental note of her office number.</p><p> </p><p>When she gets to Agatha’s office, turned around more than once by the winding corridors in the history building, it seems Agatha’s already left for the day. On the little whiteboard next to her door, she has listed her office hours. Stealing a pen and a post it from the supply closet, Rio leaves her a little note, before she goes home to pass out for fifteen hours straight.</p><p> </p><p>It’s cute, Rio thinks, as she puts her hands on Agatha’s kitchen counter, caging her in, that Agatha honestly seems to think that she came here for dinner. Or even to pet her (admittedly <em>very </em>cute) cats.</p><p>No, what she’s here for is a good fuck, to clear out her head. And it’s exactly what she gets: Agatha absolutely unravels as Rio fucks her, just opens up and takes her, splayed out beneath her, one leg in the air to get Rio exactly where she wants her, and it’s so hot Rio momentarily loses her mind from it, tells Agatha all manners of embarrassing shit that she hopes Agatha understands is just dirty talk.</p><p>She doesn’t know if it’s the professor thing or the age thing or just an Agatha thing, but there is something about giving it to Agatha that goes directly in under Rio’s skin, makes her feel completely bent out of shape about it. She wants to touch Agatha all over, familiarize herself with every inch of her body, find out how to push her every button, make her scream. Get in under <em>her</em> skin in turn.</p><p>They fuck again in the morning, Agatha on her stomach on the bed as Rio haves her from behind, slow and almost tenderly, which makes Agatha go strangely still and quiet, her sounds of pleasure suddenly low and raspy in her throat. Rio kisses her shoulder blades, strokes a hand down her spine, feels her tremble and spasm with her every touch, every thrust.</p><p>“You good?” she asks quietly, in her ear, and Agatha nods frantically, pushes back on Rio’s fingers.</p><p>Rio thinks about fucking her harder or faster, or grabbing her and pulling her up by her hips and maybe eat her out from behind, licking dirtily into her pussy while getting herself off with fingers slick from having been inside Agatha. But there is something about those noises, about Agatha’s prone body – the delicate nobs of her spine, her ass, the splay of her thighs, knees pressed into the mattress, the velvet wet hot clenching feel of her around Rio’s fingers – that makes her want to keep them in this moment a while longer, before the world intrudes.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t offer Rio her number. Maybe it should clue Rio in that she isn’t very interested, but she never says no when Rio comes around her office as a prelude to hooking up and she seems very into it.</p><p>It becomes almost like a game to Rio, to see how quickly she can disarm Agatha’s prickliness, have her pliant and panting under her hands – or even just agreeable to Rio’s suggestions of getting coffee. She doesn’t quite get what Agatha’s distancing is all about – surely, she must be aware of what the employee handbook says – but maybe it’s a game to her, too. Or maybe she thinks that Rio has some ulterior motive, fucking a senior researcher to get ahead. Maybe she’s surrounded by fawning post-grads begging to fuck her.</p><p> </p><p>“What crawled up your ass and died?”</p><p>Rio looks up at her phone at the realization that Leah’s playfully sharp question is aimed at her. “Huh?” she says. “What did you say?”</p><p>“I was asking,” Leah repeats, using her straw to aggressively stir her drink, “what’s up with you? You’ve been off all night. Is it a <em>girl</em>?”</p><p>It’s a justified question; they’re out of town for a conference and she and Jen are meeting up Leah, an old friend from grad school who’s doing her PhD at Berkeley, for the first time in over a year.</p><p>Jen snorts, takes another sip of her stupid probiotic kombucha cocktail. “Try <em>grandma</em>.”</p><p>Rio flicks a peanut at her. Leah looks between them, eyebrows raised.</p><p>“Rio is fucking this awful history professor,” Jen explains. “Agatha Harkness.” She lowers her voice a little as it says it. The hotel bar is full of academics ready to cut loose after a long day of paper presentations and who knows who Agatha knows.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness?” Leah says, looking between them. “<em>Really</em>?”</p><p>“Let me guess,” Jen says before Rio can cut in, “you had her as a teacher, a reader, or a chair once and she was terrible, whatever it was.”</p><p>“I don’t know about that,” Leah says. “But I think my supervisor used to have a thing with her or something. Whatever it was, it seems to have resulted in some bad blood.”</p><p>“Surprise,” Jen says.</p><p>Leah turns to Rio. “Like I said, I don’t really know anything about it, but you might wanna be a bit careful. Alison still seems pissed at her.”</p><p>“Yeah, because she’s <em>awful</em>,” Jen says, at the same time as Rio says, “It’s just sex.”</p><p>Jen looks at her. “‘It’s just sex’? Okay, Miss Player, if it’s ‘just sex,’ how come you’ve blown me off like three times to go hook up with her?”</p><p>Across from Jen, Leah and Rio exchange a smirk. “Well,” Rio begins patiently, as if explaining something to a child, “sometimes when I see a really sexy woman, I just want to fuck her. I think it’s called being a lesbian.”</p><p>“Ha ha,” Jen says sourly. “I just don’t get the point of having sex without an emotional connection.”</p><p>“To be fair, <em>that</em> might be a closer definition of being a lesbian,” Leah says to Rio, sticking her tongue out at the face Rio makes.</p><p>“Me and Agatha <em>do</em> have an emotional connection,” Rio says. “We both love it when my face is in her tits” – “<em>Rio</em>!” Jen interjects, sounding agonized – “and she has two very cute cats.”</p><p>“Are you sure those are cats?” Jen says, clearly aiming to change the subject away from Agatha’s tits. “They’re probably some poor students she’s hexed.”</p><p>Rio, who has just taken a drag on her own beer, starts laughing, snorts it up her nose. As she splutters and coughs, she pelts another peanut at Jen in retribution. “Don’t make witch jokes,” she says at last, deadpan. “It’s insensitive.”</p><p>Jen just rolls her eyes at that.</p><p>“You have a picture?” Leah asks and Rio pulls up Agatha’s university profile.</p><p>“Yeah?” she asks as she tilts the screen towards Leah, who nods emphatically, as if she suddenly understands exactly what Rio sees in her.</p><p>“You both suck,” Jen complains.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe Jen is onto something, Rio thinks when she gets back from the conference, drops off her bag at home, and then goes over to Agatha and fucks her for three hours straight before Agatha, in a masterclass of bad timing, tries to break off their sex thing.</p><p>“Well, you do have a milf thing,” Jen says, when Rio recounts the whole thing for her. Billy nods emphatically while Eddie just looks curiously between them. He’s new, not yet familiar with their idioms and in-jokes, but he’s sweet and seems really nice, Rio thinks, looking at the two of them cuddled up on the couch.</p><p>They’re at Rio and Billy’s, ostensibly watching a movie, some new Netflix film, but it’s boring and they’ve all stopped pretending to watch thirty minutes ago.</p><p>“It’s not a milf thing,” Rio says, stealing the bowl of popcorn out Billy’s lap. If he wants it back, he’s going to have to get out under Eddie’s arm. “You’re the only lesbian I’ve ever met who’s <em>not</em> crazy about hot older women.”</p><p>“And those hot older women, I suppose,” Billy supplies.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio says, cramming a handful of popcorn into her mouth. “Thank god.”</p><p> </p><p>After another few weeks, Agatha does give Rio her number. Rio supposes that the chances are slim that Agatha will send her any nudes, but at least hooking up via text is easier than Rio having to pass her office at an opportune moment, like stupid some 19th century court ritual. It also means that Rio can text her whatever’s on her mind, and Agatha responds more often than she would have expected.</p><p>As for work, she’s suddenly finding herself in a writing flow, and, sick of being cooped up in her apartment, moves around on campus, drifts between the library and the coffee shop and the cafeteria to get some change of scenery.</p><p>Come to think of it, she’s probably seen Agatha around campus before without knowing it, but now it’s like she’s aware of nothing else. As if there’s suddenly a live wire running between the two of them, alerting Rio whenever Agatha is near enough to see: across the quad, passing by the library, or getting coffee. Almost always from afar – if Rio’s not stopping by Agatha’s office, they don’t really meet. Which is probably a good thing; while Agatha has stopped complaining about Rio’s presence in the history building, Rio doesn’t know what Agatha would prefer: that they simply passed each other by, pretending to be strangers, or said hello or something.</p><p>Once, late one evening, Rio’s in the library writing, tucked up in a faraway corner. Despite the hour, it’s surprisingly crammed with people, mostly stressed students frantically finishing up assignments. Seeing a movement in the corner of her eye, Rio – as always seemingly utterly attuned to Agatha’s movements – looks up and sees Agatha a few rows over, clearly searching for a book, running her finger down the clothbound spines.</p><p>Rio watches her curiously: Agatha never talks about her work. Rio hasn’t pushed, but whenever they come even close to the subject of Agatha’s research, Agatha waves it away. Agatha doesn’t really strike Rio as a modest woman, so she wonders a little about it. Perhaps Agatha simply prefers to keep her work close to heart, away from prying eyes.</p><p>When she comes to the end of the row of shelves, Agatha looks up, catches Rio’s eye. There is nothing, no sense of recognition on Agatha’s face, but their gazes remain locked across the room until Agatha passes behind the next row of shelves.</p><p>A minute later, Rio – attention returned to her laptop – feel a hand, quick as a whisper, stroke across her back. She doesn’t react, doesn’t turn, just presses minutely into the touch, and then it’s gone, only the barest tingle of warmth left behind.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s apartment is really nice. Considering her apparent lack of domesticity, it’s surprisingly cozy, with heavy, comfortable furniture, beautiful paintings, floral wallpapers, and packed with books and knickknacks. And the cats: Scratch all too happy to curl up in Rio’s lap and purr like a little locomotive, and Sparky, more reserved, following her around wherever she goes to keep track of what she’s doing.</p><p>It is true that Billy’s having a party that Saturday night Rio shows up unannounced at Agatha’s – or at least his boyfriend and a couple of friends over for beers. It would, perhaps not, have been an<em> impossibility</em> to work in her room with her headphones on, but she prefers Agatha’s apartment, where she has all she needs in terms of literature and expert assistance. Not to mention cute company, she thinks, as she strokes Scratch’s ears.</p><p>When she has finally, thanks to Agatha, wrangled her analysis into some semblance of structured, linear thinking, she closes her laptop and puts it down on the floor, where Sparky immediately starts sniffing at it before she lies down on top of it, claiming it as her territory.</p><p>Rio looks over at Agatha, curled at the other end of the couch, immersed in her book, mindlessly curling a strand of her ridiculously long hair around a finger. Her robe is very nice, Rio thinks as she watches her, a silky, luxurious-looking thing with a lovely floral pattern, which, as Rio looks closer, depicts a serpent curled in among the flower stalks.</p><p>She’s never seen Agatha relaxed before, not outside of sex anyway. Except for when they’re fucking, there is something stiff and aggravated about her, as if she’s always looking for something or someone that has it out for her.</p><p>Experimentally, Rio strokes a hand up Agatha’s bare leg, in beneath the hem of the dressing gown. Agatha’s eyes don’t stray from the book page, and she makes no move, but there is a minute shift in the air, a slight tension in the muscle beneath Rio’s palm, that reveals Agatha’s disinterest as feigned.</p><p>A flashing thought has Rio wondering what Agatha has under the robe – a set of her ridiculously expensive underwear? Nothing? – accompanied by a wave of heat washing through her. Her hand moves further up Agatha’s thigh, letting her fingertips touch the soft skin of the inside of the other thigh. Apparently, she hits a ticklish spot, because Agatha she closes her legs together with a jerk, trapping Rio’s hand, and glares at her over the edge of the book.</p><p>Rio laughs at her. “Come on,” she says, horny, impatient, feeling like she deserves a reward for all the work she managed to get done, and on a Saturday night, too. “I want to fuck you.”</p><p>“I thought you were here for work.” Agatha’s tone is haughty; her eyes have returned to the book.</p><p>“Yeah, well, I’m done with work,” Rio says sweetly.</p><p>Pulling Agatha’s leg a little closer to her, Rio bends down, kisses her knee, the lowermost inside of her thigh. She feels Agatha twitch, hides a smile against her skin.</p><p>It turns into a game – Rio moving closer and closer, dropping soft kisses and soft, tickling caresses, awkwardly and obnoxiously cramming herself into Agatha’s space, until she can slide in between her and the book and kiss her on the mouth. It’s a tight fit, but Rio’s determined, clenching every muscle in her entire body to avoid falling off the couch.</p><p>When she, at last, gets Agatha into the bedroom, Agatha is all worked up, panting and wide-eyed as Rio pushes her down on the bed. Rio starts undressing, pulling her hoodie off and unzipping her pants. When Agatha’s hands move to untie the sash of her robe, however, Rio immediately says, “Don’t.”</p><p>Down to her underwear, she gets on the bed and crawls on top of Agatha’s, leans her weight on her elbows above her and kisses her, deep and dirtily. Slowly and carefully, her hands go down and begin unravelling the knot at Agatha’s waist, her lips still against Agatha’s, the kiss slowed down into something lingering and soft.</p><p>She unwraps Agatha like a present. Gently, she pulls the sash out of its hoops, the silk cool against her own overheated skin. She presses Agatha down into the mattress, kissing her hard as Agatha’s arms wrap around her and her knees come up to cage her in, effectively pushing them together, skin to skin.</p><p>Savoring every second, Rio opens up the robe with slow movements, lets the silky fabric fall away to reveal Agatha’s underwear, shiny and poisonous green against her skin. Even through the fabric, Agatha’s nipples are pebbled with arousal, her breathing deep. Reaching in under Agatha, Rio unclasps her bra and drags it away, watching intently as Agatha’s breasts, freed, fall heavy and soft against her chest, feels something shiver deep inside herself at the sight.</p><p>Resisting the urge to lean in and touch, Rio sits up and – slowly, her eyes intent on Agatha’s face –  grabs Agatha’s wrists and drags them upward. Pushing them together with one hand, she winds the silk into a clasp around them, pulling tight. Agatha’s breathing deepens, the rise and fall of her chest very noticeable with her arms pulled high overhead.</p><p>Wrapping the other end of the sash around the slats of the headboard, Rio ties Agatha to the bed with a simple knot. It wouldn’t hold Agatha unless she wishes to be held, but she has a feeling it will be enough.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes are dark, her face flushed, as Rio moves downward to sit between her splayed legs, running her hands across her soft belly. She wonders, absentmindedly, whether Agatha is already wet, what the gleam of her mouth as her lips part says about her hunger, how desperate Rio is making her right now. She thinks about Agatha’s pussy – about getting inside her with her fingers or the strap, or getting all up there with her tongue – and feels an answering stir within herself.</p><p>She gives it free reign, covers Agatha’s body with her own and leans in to kiss her again, kiss her all over, hard and deep, and thinks, wildly, <em>I could do this forever</em>, as Agatha moans and whimpers beneath her, surrendering wholly to Rio’s touch.</p><p> </p><p>When Alice finally resurfaces from hell – a.k.a the final months of finishing up her dissertation – they go out to eat, all of them. They decide that their meagre TA salaries will allow them to splurge this once and end up at a nice fusion place downtown, who happen to have one table free due to a late cancellation.</p><p>“We’re buying, of course,” Jen tells Alice. “So go nuts.”</p><p>“<em>Kinda</em> nuts, at least,” Billy amends as his eyes scan over the prices, sending Alice an apologetic smile.</p><p>Alice takes a sip from her water. “Honestly, I’m just glad to be out of the apartment. I’ve been living off cheap noodles and granola bars for two weeks, I’ll gladly eat anything.”</p><p>“It’s tapas style,” Rio says, flipping the menu card to look at the cocktails on the back. “You need, like, three per person and then we share.”</p><p>“What’s ‘Lophius’?” Eddie asks skeptically, reading from the menu.</p><p>“It’s a fish,” Rio supplies.</p><p>Eddie makes a face. “God, I can’t even tell what’s vegetarian and not. Is escarole also a fish?”</p><p>“Nope, green leaves,” Rio says.</p><p>“Wow, someone is apparently spending too much time on FoodTok,” Billy says with a rise of his eyebrows, while Jen says, “You can barely boil an egg.”</p><p>Rio shrugs. “Agatha took me last week.” She scans the cocktail list, looking for the one she’d had last time – it had absinthe in it, if she remembers correctly.</p><p>The table goes quiet around her. “<em>Here</em>?” Billy says at last, sounding very impressed, while Jen says, “<em>Agatha Harkness</em>?” as if there’s more than one.</p><p>Rio looks up for a second, before returning to the drink menu. “Yeah.” At long last, she catches sight of her drink. “I had a Primal Night – it’s really good.”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Billy says, and when Rio glances up again, they’re all staring at her anew: Billy, Eddie, Alice, Jen. “You and Agatha went on a <em>date</em>.”</p><p>Rio scoffs. “It wasn’t a date. It was just dinner. Agatha likes this place, I think.”</p><p>“So you just rolled out of bed and let her buy you an expensive dinner?” Jen says, which makes Alice snort.</p><p>“Sounds like you have a sugar mama,” Alice says. “I guess that’s one way of surviving academia.” They all laugh, and Alice raises her water glass to salute Rio. “No judgment,” she adds. “I would kill for a hot older professor buying me dinner and helping me with my writing.”</p><p>Rio opens her mouth to tell them off, but closes it again when she doesn’t quite know what to say. “That’s not what it is,” she says at last.</p><p>Jen looks at her. “You might not know this, but hanging out and being exclusive is what most people refer to as ‘dating.’”</p><p>“What, Rio’s not sleeping with anyone else?” Alice asks, in a fake whisper, as if pretending Rio isn’t supposed to hear. Jen shakes her head around a wicked smile.</p><p>Rio makes an unimpressed face at them. “You guys calling me a slut?”</p><p>“No, you just have, shall we say, an <em>appetite for life</em>,” Billy says, setting off a new round of laughter, and more friendly ribbing.</p><p>The waiter arrives right in the midst of it and no one’s done so they send him away and bend over the menus again.</p><p>Rio looks down at it, smooths a hand across the thick, creamy paper. When she and Agatha had been here, they hadn’t even ordered properly; instead, Agatha had asked the waiter to bring them a selection of their best dishes.</p><p>She had been dressed in a white shirt and a deep blue blazer, hair put up, and Rio hadn’t been able to stop looking at her, had suddenly felt ridiculously out of place, stupidly young and unworldly next to Agatha’s effortless elegance.</p><p>The cocktail, when it arrived, had helped, as had the moment when Agatha had looked at her across the table and said, “It’s been a long time since I had someone to properly discuss work with. Not budgets or student numbers or whatnot, but the actual <em>work</em>, you know?” Rio nodded; she did know. “It’s nice,” Agatha had added, and it had sounded sincere, not like a come-on, or as if she was humoring Rio.</p><p>The sex afterward had been a surprise: ardent and tender, bodies tangling under the sheets, coming together slowly, Rio moving on top of Agatha, between her legs, belly to belly, to come inside her, Agatha sighing into Rio’s mouth, arms wound around Rio’s shoulders, knees bracketing Rio’s hips, keeping her there, near, in place.</p><p>She recalls the morning after, Agatha making them fancy coffee in her stupid fancy coffee maker, bringing it to Rio in bed, the line of Agatha’s body pressed up warmly against Rio’s side as they drank it, the rustling of the newspaper Agatha had opened on her lap. Rio can almost see it before her, Agatha’s smile, her too-loud laughter, the adorable little furrow between her eyes as she scanned the paper, feel the taste of coffee-flavored kisses, and thinks to herself, <em>Oh shit</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had half-joked about going out somewhere to celebrate when she finally handed in her latest chapter to Lilia, and Agatha, surprisingly, takes her up on it, brings her to some Italian place, even more fancy than the other restaurant Agatha chose. Agatha is very attentive: orders in ridiculously expensive wine, keeps leaning in to touch Rio’s hand below the table, smiles at her across the table.</p><p>Rio, still caught up in last week’s <em>realization</em> like a fly in a sticky spider’s web, squirms in her seat, torn between the bubbly wish to believe that this actually is a date and the stone-heavy knowledge that it in all likelihood isn’t. Desperately, she tries to steer the situation back into safe territory, to the straight and narrow path of normalcy, by aggressively flirting with Agatha. When the entrees arrive, she has kicked off her shoe and let her foot slowly move up the length of Agatha’s leg while smirking at her across the table, making Agatha drop her fork at one point.</p><p>When they at last, cutting out dessert, end up in the restaurant bathroom, fucking wildly in one of the stalls, it’s a relief, as if Rio’s feet are finally back on solid ground. <em>This</em> she knows, this is familiar and safe – a hard fuck in a public bathroom is as far from romantic or feelings as you get she thinks, the bathroom tile cold against her back.</p><p>As they walk out of the restaurant, into the chill autumn night, Agatha takes Rio’s hand. “Come home with me,” she murmurs, quietly, into her ear, effectively scuttling all Rio’s pretenses of having control over the situation.</p><p>“I have work,” she tries. “I need to write all day tomorrow.”</p><p>“Your laptop is at my place,” Agatha says, because of course it is.</p><p>Rio gives in.</p>
