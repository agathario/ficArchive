<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>When award-winning actress Agatha Harkness begins receiving escalating threats from a dangerous stalker, her agent hires elite bodyguard Rio Vidal and her team to protect her. Rio is disciplined, guarded, and determined to keep things strictly professional—but Agatha, America’s beloved yet notoriously difficult star, has other plans. Sparks fly as the line between duty and desire blurs, forcing them to balance the glare of the public eye, the lurking danger of a relentless stalker, and the growing pull of a love neither expected.</p></blockquote>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio’s internal alarm woke her at 6:00 a.m. on the dot, just as it always did. Years in the Special Forces had drilled the habit into her: wake before the birds, before the sun, before the rest of the world.</p>
<p>She got out of bed and pulled on a sports bra and loose sweatpants, her body moving on autopilot. On her way out, she stopped at Victoria’s terrarium. The tarantula stirred as Rio dropped in her breakfast. Most people thought she was crazy for keeping one, but Victoria had been with her through everything, deployments, long nights overseas, and the hollow ache of her discharge.</p>
<p>Crossing the penthouse, Rio watered her plants. She found peace in the simple act, the ritual of checking each leaf and stem. Over time, her home had transformed into more of a greenhouse than a penthouse, but she wouldn’t have it any other way. While Rio wouldn't call herself extremely rich, she is well off, having saved as much of her military earnings and her earnings from her Bodyguard business.</p>
<p>Finally, she locked the door and set off on her usual morning run. One of the perks of waking before God herself was that the streets were almost empty, save for the occasional straggler or stray animal. This was her favorite time of day—quiet, steady, and hers alone.</p>
<p>She was three miles into her five-mile run when her phone buzzed. Maria Hill’s name flashed across the screen.<br/>
Rio slowed her pace and veered off to the side of the trail before answering. She and Maria had been friends for over twenty years, their bond forged in the military. Rio had been a team leader in Delta Force, and Maria a commander in MARSOC—Marine Raiders. They first crossed paths on a joint operation and hit it off instantly.</p>
<p>Maria’s career ended abruptly after a dishonorable discharge under the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. Years later, when Rio herself left the service—this time honorably—they reconnected. Out of that reunion, their company was born: S.H.I.E.L.D. (Specialized Hostile Intervention &amp; Elite Life Defense). A bodyguard company for the elite, including Actors, musicians, politicians, athletes, and billionaires/millionaires.</p>
<p>Rio had insisted Maria take the title of CEO; she never cared for the day-to-day bureaucracy. She preferred the fieldwork, the action. Co-CEO suited her fine—close enough to keep a hand in the business, far enough to stay private.</p>
<p>She thumbed her headset on. “Good morning, Maria. What went wrong this early?”</p>
<p>“Good morning, Rio,” Maria replied, amused but exhausted. “Why do you always assume something went wrong?”</p>
<p>Rio smirked, wiping sweat from her brow. “Because you don’t usually call me at six in the morning when you know I’ll be in the office in a few hours. So what’s so urgent you couldn’t wait to tell me face to face?”</p>
<p>“I just got off the phone with an agent for a very high-profile actress,” Maria explained. “She’s requesting our services—and she asked for you specifically to lead the team. The agent will be here at nine to go over everything, but she wouldn’t give me much over the phone.”</p>
<p>“Do you have a name? And any idea why she asked for me in particular?” Rio asked, already pivoting on her heel and heading back toward home. She needed a shower and a change of clothes before the meeting.</p>
<p>“She only gave her first name—Lilia. Said she’d explain more when she got here. I pressed her, but she was tight-lipped. From her tone, though, I’d say she’s rattled about something.” Maria’s clipped voice carried that edge of annoyance Rio knew well—the kind that came when someone tried to withhold intel.</p>
<p>“I might’ve protected one of her clients before.” Rio quickened her pace. “Is the actress herself coming to the meeting, or just Lilia?”</p>
<p>“Just the agent for now,” Maria confirmed. “Once we have the logistics and know exactly what we’re walking into, then we’ll meet her client, if we take the job.”</p>
<p>“Understood. I’ll be in after I change.”</p>
<p>Maria grunted her acknowledgement, and Rio ended the call.</p>
<p>The rest of the run home blurred as her mind churned. Who was the client? Why had Lilia insisted on her, specifically? And what was so urgent—and dangerous—that an agent this seasoned sounded cagey on the phone?</p>
<p>By the time Rio made it home, the clock read 7:30. She didn’t waste a second—jumped into the shower, dressed quickly, and pulled on her usual work attire: black slacks and a crisp white button-up. As always, she rolled her sleeves to the elbows, exposing the ink that marked her left arm.</p>
<p>Her sleeve tattoo wound upward from wrist to shoulder, an old oak tree etched in striking detail. Each leaf represented someone she’d lost—teammates, loved ones, ghosts she carried with her every day. Vines stretched from the trunk, twisting across her ribs and back like roots refusing to let go. On her right arm, the insignia of her Delta Force unit stood bold, under a portrait of Santa Muerte, a nod to her call sign, Lady Death, and a quiet tribute to her Puerto Rican roots.</p>
<p>One more glance at the clock told her it was time to move. Grabbing her keys, she slipped into her Lincoln Aviator SUV and made a quick detour to her local coffee shop. The baristas knew her well enough to start her usual order the moment she walked in. One of them tried to flirt, as always. Rio responded with polite deflection, offered a small smile, left a tip, and was gone.</p>
<p>The rest of the drive passed quickly. She knew the back routes of L.A. like the palm of her hand, weaving around traffic until she pulled into the garage at 8:30 sharp—record time.<br/>
Inside, she scanned her ID, offered a nod to the security guard, and stepped into the elevator. She pressed the button for the top floor, the domain she and Maria ran together.<br/>
The elevator doors slid open with a muted chime, and Rio stepped into the quiet, polished corridor of the top floor. The walls were lined with framed commendations, photos of past clients, and discreetly displayed medals, equal parts professional polish and subtle warning.</p>
<p>Maria’s office door was already open. Rio knocked once on the frame before stepping inside.</p>
<p>Maria sat behind her desk, posture straight, expression sharp, though the faint crease between her brows betrayed her exhaustion and irritation. A neat stack of files was spread out in front of her, but Rio knew Maria had already memorized every line.</p>
<p>“Right on time,” Maria said, glancing at the clock.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Rio replied, setting her coffee on the edge of the desk and handing Maria’s coffee order to her before leaning against it. “Any updates from our mysterious Lilia?”</p>
<p>Maria gave a tight shake of her head. “Nothing. I’ve run her name through our system—too common. Could be anyone. No background, no trail, no agency records that match. Either she’s covering her tracks, or someone’s covering them for her.”</p>
<p>Rio hummed, her eyes narrowing. “So we’re walking in blind.”</p>
<p>“Not the first time,” Maria said dryly, though her tone carried the weight of experience.</p>
<p>Rio smirked faintly. “And it won’t be the last.”</p>
<p>Maria closed the folder in front of her and folded her hands. “She’ll be here in about thirty minutes. I want us on the same page before she walks through that door. No promises, no commitments, not until we know who we’re protecting and what we’re protecting them from.”</p>
<p>“Understood,” Rio said. She straightened, her jaw tightening with anticipation. “If she asked for me by name, then it’s already personal. And I don’t like going in blind when someone else is pulling strings.”</p>
<p>Maria studied her for a long moment, then gave a small nod. “Then let’s see what kind of game Lilia is playing.”</p>
<p>The room fell quiet, the hum of the city below faint through the glass windows. Both women knew that whoever was about to walk through their doors wasn’t bringing them a simple assignment, this was going to be trouble.</p>
<p>Maria and Rio made their way to the sleek conference room they always reserved for clients. The room smelled faintly of polished wood and fresh coffee, the kind of neutral space meant to make negotiations feel safe. A call came through from the front desk: they’re escorting Lilia up now.</p>
<p>They only had to wait a few minutes before the doors opened. Lilia entered first, flanked by discreet but imposing security. The moment she crossed the threshold, the atmosphere in the room shifted.</p>
<p>Rio’s instinct kicked in immediately—her mind cataloguing Lilia’s movements, her attire, the aura she carried. The woman’s presence was commanding, almost regal, like an old-world matriarch who’d seen generations rise and fall. She wore a long Italian coat that looked more heirloom than fashion, the fabric catching the light in wisps as if it had a history of its own. Rio couldn’t shake the sense that she’d seen her before, though the exact memory eluded her.</p>
<p>Both Maria and Rio stood to greet her.</p>
<p>“Hi, Lilia. I’m glad you made it alright. Would you like anything to drink?” Maria asked with her usual measured politeness.</p>
<p>“No thanks, dear,” Lilia replied smoothly, her voice warm but carrying steel beneath it. “I would rather we just get straight into it. I’m sorry for the secrecy, but given the recent events I figured, better safe than sorry.”</p>
<p>Rio immediately appreciated her no-nonsense approach. But what caught her off guard was how Lilia’s gaze lingered on her. Not a passing glance, but a careful, deliberate study, as though the older woman was reading her like tarot cards.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Maria said, motioning for everyone to sit. “Please tell us who your client is, and how we may offer our assistance.”</p>
<p>Lilia’s posture straightened as if she were about to deliver a verdict. “My client’s name is Agatha Harkness.”</p>
<p>Rio froze. She knew that name—everyone knew that name. Agatha was an international megastar, a two-time EGOT winner whose career stretched back to childhood. Agnes of Westview. Witches Road. The cult hit Salemites. She was a household name, and for Rio, something more personal. Agatha had been her gay awakening, her untouchable celebrity crush. The woman whose very existence had shifted her own.</p>
<p>Her shock must have been written across her face, because Lilia allowed herself the faintest smile before moving on.</p>
<p>“Agatha has a stalker,” she explained. “She’s dealt with stalkers before, but this one has escalated in ways that are… troubling. The security we’ve hired previously failed to contain them. Worse, one was bribed into selling private footage from inside her home. Whoever this is, they’re bold, resourceful, and not stopping. I know you are the best at what you do, and I am willing to pay whatever is needed to ensure Agatha’s safety.”</p>
<p>Maria jotted down notes, her expression composed. Rio forced herself to focus, though her pulse quickened.</p>
<p>“How long has this been going on? We’ll need a record of every incident since it started,” Rio pressed, slipping into her professional cadence. “And why me specifically? Why ask for me to lead the team?”</p>
<p>Lilia met her eyes again, and this time her tone softened, the weight of something deeply personal carried in her voice.</p>
<p>“This began about three years ago. At first, it was fan mail, then it turned possessive. Gifts left on her car, her doorstep, even her bed. Friends and colleagues threatened. Phones hacked. The pattern has only grown worse. As for you, Rio… I asked for you because my full name is Lilia Calderu. You knew my son.”</p>
<p>The name hit Rio like a shockwave. Calderu. Her brain scrambled, then locked onto it—Colten “Pots” Calderu. The youngest of her unit, eager, bright, shadowing her every move like a kid brother. He’d earned his call sign because his name closely resembles cauldron. And his love of cooking. He’d idolized her.</p>
<p>Rio’s throat tightened. When she was discharged, her team had stayed behind. Their last mission had claimed them all. She had never stopped carrying that guilt, and Colten, sweet, loyal Colten, was the heaviest weight of all.</p>
<p>She gasped softly, the realization cracking through her professional mask.</p>
<p>“Ma’am, I am so sorry. I carry the weight of his passing with me every day. Colten is one of the main reasons I started this business. I couldn’t protect him, but I will protect my clients with my life, if I must.”</p>
<p>She held Lilia’s gaze, hoping the older woman could hear the sincerity and the guilt. Woven through her words.</p>
<p>Lilia’s lips curved into a warm but sorrowful smile. She lifted her hand in a gentle wave, dismissing the apology.</p>
<p>“No need, dear. My Colten wrote me almost every day, and he always spoke of you like you hung the moon and the stars. You were the sister he never had. He would never blame you, and I sure as hell don’t either. With the way he talked about you, and adding in your very impressive, decorated reputation, I trust no one more with Agatha’s safety.”</p>
<p>Maria, who had been silently observing, felt the weight settle in the room. She saw how Rio carried her ghosts, how the guilt of her team’s deaths still lingered like a shadow. That decided it for her.</p>
<p>“We’ll take Agatha as a client,” Maria said firmly, closing her notebook and rising from her chair. “Rio will assemble her best team today while I draw up the paperwork. If you can bring Agatha in tomorrow to meet the team and finalize the necessary documents, we can have her security detail in place before tomorrow night.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much. Agatha can be… difficult, and at times self-destructive,” Lilia admitted, her voice softening with a note of affection. “But she deserves the best, and this company is it.”</p>
<p>She stood, shaking both Maria’s and Rio’s hands with firm gratitude before sweeping from the room.</p>
<p>Rio watched her go, the weight of the responsibility settling on her shoulders. She pulled out her tablet and began scrolling through her roster, mind already racing through names. This would require nothing less than a six-man team—the threat level was high, and the danger almost guaranteed to escalate. Only her A-Team would do.</p>
<p>Maria gave a final nod, gathering her notes as she headed out to begin the paperwork. The office fell quiet, leaving Rio alone with her thoughts. She exhaled slowly, pinching the bridge of her nose before scribbling down potential assignments.</p>
<p>Tomorrow. Tomorrow she’d meet the Agatha Harkness—America’s darling, beloved and feared in equal measure. Rio only hoped she wouldn’t make a fool of herself in front of the woman whose name carried so much fire.</p>

<p>Rio spent the night poring over files, chasing the perfect balance. She needed professionals who could follow orders and execute flawlessly—dangerous, loyal, and disciplined enough to know when to pull the trigger and when to hold back. This job was bigger than just keeping Agatha safe; it would be round-the-clock, relentless, and under constant scrutiny.</p><p>And then there was Agatha herself. Rio knew her reputation—charming, flirty, a self-proclaimed menace. From a distance, Rio had always found it endearing, even funny. But facing it head-on, twenty-four hours a day, she wondered if she had the patience to match her professionalism against Agatha’s chaos.</p><p>When it came to her team, Rio played it smart. No one who might be swayed by Agatha’s magnetic charm. Everyone chosen was either happily partnered or simply not interested in women. While fraternization wasn’t technically against company policy, it was frowned upon—and one scandal could mean investigations, ruined reputations, and jobs lost.</p><p>By dawn, she had her six. Files spread across her desk like a hand of cards, Rio tapped out individual messages summoning them to the office at 10 a.m. sharp.</p><p>Alice Wu-Gulliver: Former cop and detective, daughter of rock icon Lorna Wu—though she preferred her stepfather’s name, Gulliver. Rio’s closest friend, apart from Maria,  and one of the first hires when SHIELD was founded. Alice would head tech, security systems, and fortification of Agatha’s home.</p><p>Natasha Romanov-Hill: Once a KGB assassin, now Maria’s wife—and still one of the most intimidating operatives Rio had ever met. Natasha would serve as second-in-command, accompanying Agatha and Rio to public events, and whenever they go out in public</p><p>Yelena Belova: Natasha’s adopted younger sister, equally trained in espionage, though a touch more reckless. Ruthless when she needed to be, Yelena would lead house and vehicle security, rotating with Bucky, and join major public appearances where an extra layer of muscle was essential.</p><p>Clint Barton: A debate in Rio’s mind, but ultimately an asset she couldn’t overlook. Older, edging toward retirement, but still sharp, still deadly accurate. A marksman, a driver, and a watcher at the gate. Clint was family to Natasha and Maria, which made him family to Rio as well.</p><p>Bucky Barnes: Rio’s longest-running ally. They’d served side by side in Delta, and she still thought of him as an older brother. After years as a CIA assassin, he’d joined SHIELD three years earlier, settling down with his husband, Sam Wilson. He would serve as third-in-command, shadowing Rio and Natasha on every high-profile outing.</p><p>The list was clean, solid, unshakable. Rio fired it off to Maria, who sent back her immediate approval. Satisfied, Rio closed her laptop. Tomorrow would be the start of something big—new client, new risks, new team dynamic. She could only hope she wouldn’t let anyone down.</p><p>Especially not Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Across town, Lilia was doing her best to reason with an increasingly restless Agatha. The actress paced the length of her living room, heels clicking against hardwood, agitation radiating from her with every step. She wasn’t angry at Lilia, not really—just furious that things had escalated to the point where a 24/7 security detail was no longer optional.</p><p>“Agatha, these people are the absolute best at what they do,” Lilia pressed, voice steady but firm. “They guard half of Hollywood’s elite. I met with the CEOs today—they’re more than willing to take you on. The team leader, Rio—she was my son’s squad leader in Special Forces. He trusted her with his life and idolized her. I’ve done my research on the company, and they’re legit. They’ve never lost a client, never had one harmed.”</p><p>That made Agatha stop mid-pace. Lilia rarely mentioned her son. Everyone knew he’d died overseas, but the details had always been private.</p><p>“Didn’t he die during a mission?” Agatha shot back sharply, the words out before she could stop them. “Where was this Rio person when he died?”</p><p>The look on Lilia’s face gutted her.</p><p>Jennifer Kale, Agatha’s publicist, winced, while Billy Maximoff—Agatha’s ever-patient assistant—appeared at her side with a glass of water. On the other end of the couch, Wanda Maximoff watched with open disapproval.</p><p>“Rio was injured during a previous mission,” Lilia said tightly, but with dignity. “She was honorably discharged before the mission that took my son’s life—and that of his entire unit. I spoke with her today, Agatha. She still carries that loss as heavily as I do. They were inseparable—like siblings. Nothing she could have done would’ve changed the outcome.”</p><p>The fight drained from Agatha in an instant. She collapsed onto the couch, pressing the heel of her hand against her forehead. “I’m sorry. That was low. I just…” She gestured helplessly. “I don’t want to be watched, followed, treated like a baby in a world that’s waiting to break me.”</p><p>Wanda slid onto the couch beside her, looping an arm over her shoulders. “Agatha, this isn’t about control—it’s about survival. The last security team couldn’t handle you on their best day. These people can. Trust me. When I had that obsessed fan a few years back, this company handled it. The woman they sent me? Professional. Terrifying. One day, that fan was outside my gate, and the next… he was gone. They get results. They’ll take care of you.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, leaning into Wanda’s comfort despite herself.</p><p>Wanda had been in her life for almost 20 years since Agatha was 25 and Wanda was sixteen, a newcomer to Hollywood. Agatha had taken her under her wing, and though the public had always speculated, shipping them as something more. The truth was simpler and deeper. Wanda had Vision, her first love, her husband, the father of her twins.</p><p>Agatha… Agatha had never been one for relationships. She lived fast, burned bright, and left people dazzled but never tied down. More of a fuck e'emand leave em kind of girl.<br/>
They weren’t lovers. They were sisters. And Wanda wasn’t about to let her sister throw herself to the wolves.</p><p>“Fine, I’ll meet with them. But Wanda’s coming with me,” Agatha declared, tone leaving no room for argument.</p><p>“Of course,” Wanda said easily, squeezing her friend’s hand.</p><p>“Perfect,” Lilia replied with relief. “We leave in an hour. You’ll be meeting the entire team today—six of the best operatives SHIELD has to offer.” She stood, pulling out her phone to message Rio, then paused at the door. “Oh, and Agatha? Do not sleep with your bodyguard. I don’t want Jen suffering a heart attack cleaning up that scandal.”</p><p>Lilia left, but the warning had the opposite effect. Agatha’s head snapped up, eyes glinting. “Wait. Did she just imply my bodyguard’s hot?”</p><p>Wanda groaned, already seeing the spark of trouble. She smacked Agatha lightly on the back of the head. “No. Agatha, no. Cool your libido for once. She’s going to be in charge of your life. Don’t screw it up by screwing her.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t listening. She pulled out her phone and navigated straight to SHIELD’s website, smirking when she found the staff directory. It didn’t take long to spot Rio Vidal—her new team leader and co-CEO of the entire company.</p><p>Agatha nearly dropped her phone. Holy shit. Tan skin, sharp jawline, warm honey-brown eyes that seemed to stare right through the screen. A faint tattoo peeked from her collar, hinting at more ink hidden beneath. Commanding. Gorgeous. Dangerous. Hot.</p><p>Suddenly, the idea of a bodyguard 24/7 seemed far less suffocating.</p><p>“Fuck. She’s hot,” Wanda muttered, leaning over Agatha’s shoulder. “If I weren’t married, I’d do unspeakable things to that woman.”</p><p>“Please,” Jennifer Kale scoffed, crossing her arms. “I am single. Maybe I’ll shoot my shot.”</p><p>Agatha’s head whipped around, glaring daggers. The surge of jealousy was ridiculous—she hadn’t even met Rio yet—but the thought of anyone else trying it? Unacceptable. She smirked to herself. This is going to be fun.</p><p>An hour later, Agatha, Wanda, Lilia, Jen, and Billy pulled up to SHIELD headquarters. The sleek building loomed like a fortress, humming with quiet authority.</p><p>Inside the lobby, Maria Hill was waiting. “Welcome to SHIELD. I’m Maria Hill, co-founder and CEO. I can promise you, there are no safer hands than ours. Rio has assembled an all-star team, and frankly? I fear for the lives of anyone foolish enough to test them.” She shook each of their hands, then signaled security as she led them toward the elevators.</p><p>Agatha, never one to waste an opportunity, smirked. “So… is everyone in this company hot, or is that just part of the hiring process?”</p><p>Lilia groaned. Jen rolled her eyes. Wanda buried her face in her hands.</p><p>Maria only smirked. “Rio anticipated your… charm. She handpicked a team of professionals, happily taken or not interested in women. I’d also advise you not to flirt with me when we go inside. My wife is on your detail, and she’s very possessive.”</p><p>That earned a ripple of laughter from Lilia, Jen, and Wanda. Agatha blinked, impressed despite herself. “Fine. Which one’s your wife, so I know who not to flirt with?”</p><p>“The redhead,” Maria replied dryly as the elevator chimed open.</p><p>Moments later, she pushed open the conference room doors. Conversations cut off instantly. The team stood. And then Rio turned.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>Rio was even more devastating in person—broad-shouldered in a tailored black suit, a sharp contrast to her warm eyes. Authority clung to her like armor, and that faint neck tattoo teased Agatha’s imagination in dangerous directions.</p><p>Rio, for her part, nearly forgot how to breathe. Agatha Harkness. Standing there in deep purple trousers, crisp white blouse, and a navy coat that belonged on the cover of a magazine. Stunning. Untouchable. Everything Rio had crushed on in secret—now inches away.</p><p>Professionalism saved her. Barely.</p><p>“Hello, Ms. Harkness. And hello again, Lilia.” Rio’s voice was steady, controlled, even though her pulse thundered. “Thank you for coming. I’ll introduce you to the team, we’ll go over ground rules and protocols, sign paperwork, and then escort you home. Your new security detail begins tonight.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled into a slow, mischievous smirk. Game on.</p><p>Rio straightened, professional mask firmly in place. “Allow me to introduce you to your detail, Ms. Harkness. Each of them is the best at what they do.”<br/>
She gestured to the woman closest.</p><p>“Alice Gulliver.” Alice, in dark jeans and a leather jacket, gave an easy nod. “Tech, surveillance, systems security. I’ll make sure your home, vehicles, and digital footprint are locked tighter than Fort Knox.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, amused. “So you’ll know if I order midnight pizza?”</p><p>Alice smirked. “I’ll know if you breathe near your phone, Ms. Harkness.”</p><p>“Terrifying. I like her already.” Agatha winked. Rio cleared her throat.</p><p>“Natasha Romanov-Hill.” The redhead stepped forward, calm but with an edge that could cut steel. “ Apart from Rio, you will be seeing me the most. You’ll see me at public events, alongside Rio.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “The redhead. Right. So you’re the wife I was warned not to flirt with?”</p><p>Natasha’s lips twitched. “Correct. And consider this fair warning back, you really don’t want to test that theory.”</p><p>Wanda coughed to hide her laugh. Jen mouthed yikes. Rio gave Agatha a look that said Behave.</p><p>“Wait, you are who was sent to protect me a few years back from that obsessed fan, I see you are still as terrifying as I remember. I'm glad to see Agatha is in good hands though.” Wanda says, recognizing the redhead, it took her a second to place her, but she can never forget the women who possibly saved her life and the life of her family.</p><p>“It is good to see you again Mrs. Maximoff, glad to see you have stayed safe and out of trouble. “ Natasha said, nodding to Wanda.</p><p>“Yelena Belova.”  The younger blonde said with a cocky grin and a wave. She leaned against the wall as if she owned it. “House and vehicle security lead. You’ll see me at major events too. I’m the one who tells you when to duck.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “And what if I don’t?”</p><p>“Then I throw you over my shoulder and run. You’ll thank me later.”</p><p>“Bold,” Agatha purred, but Yelena just grinned wider. Agatha got the sense her and Yelena will get along very well seeing as their personalities seem to match.</p><p>“Clint Barton.” A man in his forties with sharp eyes and a laid-back stance gave a half-wave. “Driver, marksman, gate security. I’ll get you where you need to go and make sure no one’s following.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “So basically, my chauffeur?”</p><p>“Chauffeur with a gun and a very high tolerance for divas.” Clint shot back smoothly.</p><p>Wanda actually snorted. Agatha pretended to look offended, but clearly loved it. At least its looking like her team isn't all a bunch of stuck-up men in suits who wouldn't know fun if it smacked them in the face.</p><p>“Bucky Barnes.” He was tall and broad, steady, with short dark hair. “Third-in-command. I’ll be with Rio and Natasha at all public appearances. Think of me as the wall between you and the world.”</p><p>Agatha studied him, noting the quiet power in his presence. “Big wall. Sturdy. Handsome. I approve.”</p><p>“Glad to meet your standards,” Bucky deadpanned.</p><p>Finally, Rio straightened, drawing every eye back to her.</p><p>“And I am Rio Vidal. Co-CEO of SHIELD, your team leader, and the one directly responsible for your safety. Everything goes through me.”</p><p>For a beat, silence hung in the air.</p><p>Agatha let her gaze trail over Rio openly, unapologetic. The suit. The tattoos. The warm, unflinching eyes. She smiled like a cat who’d found cream.</p><p>“So you’re the one I’ll be seeing… twenty-four seven?” she asked, voice velvet, laced with mischief.</p><p>Rio held her ground, though her pulse stuttered. “Yes, ma’am. Twenty-four seven.”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk deepened. “Well. Suddenly, this whole bodyguard thing doesn’t sound so terrible.”</p><p>The team collectively groaned under their breath. Wanda buried her face in her hands again. Lilia just pinched the bridge of her nose, already feeling a migraine coming on.</p><p>Rio, unshaken, moved briskly on. “We’ll review ground rules and protocols now. Ms. Harkness, please try to keep your comments… professional.”</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, eyes never leaving Rio. “No promises.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Everyone gathered around the table, the air charged with a mix of seriousness and Agatha’s usual flair for chaos.</p>
<p>“Alright,” Rio began, voice crisp and commanding, “my team will need Ms. Harkness’s full schedule—every event, location, time, duration. We need to coordinate with event security and ensure there are no gaps. All fan mail goes through Yelena and Alice first. Ms. Harkness is not to touch anything before one of us clears it.”</p>
<p>“As much as I’d love you calling me ‘Ms. Harkness’ in some more… intimate setting when we’re doing other things, just call me Agatha, darling,” Agatha said with a sly grin.</p>
<p>Rio kept her expression neutral, her training the only thing stopping her from reacting.</p>
<p>Before the silence stretched too long, Jen produced a spray bottle and spritzed Agatha right in the face.</p>
<p>“No. Bad Agatha. No sleeping with security,” Jen scolded like she was training a dog.</p>
<p>Agatha gasped, affronted. Wanda nearly fell out of her chair laughing while Lilia and Billy hid their amusement behind polite coughs. The security team looked stoic, though their eyes betrayed their amusement.</p>
<p>“Hey, can I get one of those?” Yelena asked.</p>
<p>Rio shot her a glare before snapping the conversation back to order.</p>
<p>“Agatha, the most important thing is that you listen to me and my team. If we tell you to move, you move. No arguments. And if I have to, I will carry you out over my shoulder.”<br/>
Agatha’s lips parted, ready to say something scandalous about how much she’d enjoy that, but Jen—predictably—sprayed her again.</p>
<p>“Stop that!” Agatha yelped, swatting the bottle.</p>
<p>Rio didn’t miss a beat, continuing as if none of this nonsense was happening.</p>
<p>“Your protection is our single priority. With stalkers, escalation is inevitable until we track them down and stop them. I’ve dealt with stalkers before. They don’t stop until someone makes them.”</p>
<p>Wanda leaned forward, her protective instincts overriding her usual composure.</p>
<p>“We’ve gone to the police, private investigators, half a dozen bodyguard companies. No one’s found them. How are you so sure your team can?”</p>
<p>Rio’s tone softened, steady and reassuring. “Alice was in the Threat Management Unit—specializing in stalking cases. She’s never lost one. Natasha, Yelena, Clint, and Bucky are former spies. They can dig up information and track anyone. And me? I was Delta Force. You don’t get better than this team.”</p>
<p>“So…” Agatha leaned forward, eyes bright with curiosity. “I’ve basically got a squad of assassins watching my back?”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“Wait—really? You’re all assassins?” she asked, far more interested now, impressed… and, judging by the way her gaze lingered on Rio, slightly turned on.</p>
<p>“Yelena and Nat are former KGB. Bucky and Clint, CIA. And I was Delta Force,” Rio confirmed evenly. “You’ve got the best watching over you.”</p>
<p>Agatha and her entourage just stared, jaws slack.</p>
<p>“Damn,” Jen muttered, breaking the tension with a crooked grin. “Maria was right. I’m starting to feel bad for the stalker.”</p>
<p>The room was still reeling from the reveal of everyone’s backgrounds. Even Wanda, who had been skeptical, sat back in her chair and slowly nodded.</p>
<p>Agatha, of course, smirked, leaning forward with that familiar gleam in her eye.</p>
<p>“Well, this just got a lot sexier,” she purred.</p>
<p>Before Rio could even respond, Jen reached for the spray bottle again. Agatha shrieked and ducked out of the way, nearly toppling her chair.</p>
<p>Yelena snorted. “God, I really do need one of those,” she said, grinning.</p>
<p>Rio ignored the chaos like a seasoned professional. Her voice cut through the laughter, steady and commanding.  “My team isn’t here to be your playthings or the punchline to a joke. We’re here because whoever is out there doesn’t see you as ‘America’s sweetheart,’ Agatha. They see you as theirs. That is dangerous. They will not stop. And we—” she glanced to her team, each one stone-faced and ready “—will not fail.”</p>
<p>The weight of her words sobered the room instantly. Wanda reached over, resting a hand on Agatha’s arm in silent agreement. Lilia’s sharp eyes flicked toward Rio, measuring the steel in her tone.</p>
<p>Agatha, uncharacteristically quiet for a beat, finally tilted her head, lips curving into a smaller, softer smile.</p>
<p>“Fine. I’ll behave… mostly. But if you ever do have to carry me over your shoulder, darling, I expect at least dinner first.”</p>
<p>Jen didn’t hesitate. Spray.</p>
<p>“Jen!” Agatha yelped, while the rest of the table dissolved into laughter again. Even Rio couldn’t quite stop the corner of her mouth from twitching.</p>
<p>“Alice, get the equipment loaded. Yelena, Bucky, vehicles. We’ll rendezvous out back,” Rio ordered, her tone leaving no room for argument. Her team nodded in unison and filed out.</p>
<p>Jen spoke up, half defensive, half curious. “We already have a car waiting for us.”</p>
<p>Rio turned her gaze on her. “We’ll be using entirely new vehicles, cameras, passwords, and codes. Everything gets replaced. If your stalker has half the resources I suspect, they already know your routines. They may have hacked your feeds, they've even bribed someone who used to be on payroll. We’re cutting every thread they might pull on.” Her words were sharp, but the logic irrefutable. Even Lilia gave a reluctant nod.</p>
<p>Maria leaned in smoothly. “Mrs. Maximoff, you’re an actress as well. I assume you have your own security team. When you’re with Agatha, do you plan to use them? Or would you like us to cover you both?”</p>
<p>“I do have my own team,” Wanda admitted. “But they don’t usually come with me when I’m with Agatha. If you can plan around that, I’d appreciate it.”</p>
<p>Rio and Maria exchanged a brief look, silent but decisive. They didn’t need words; years of shared experience spoke for them. Agatha felt a hot curl of jealousy twist in her chest at how easily Rio and Maria communicated, even though she knew it was irrational.</p>
<p>“When you and Agatha are out together, I’ll assign Bucky or Yelena as additional cover,” Rio said firmly. Her phone buzzed, a message from Alice: All set downstairs.</p>
<p>“Good. Let’s move. We’ll head to Agatha’s home, finalize the schedule, and begin installing new security.” Rio stood, prompting the entire room to rise with her.</p>
<p>“Finally taking me back to my place?” Agatha smirked. She spotted Jen reaching for the spray bottle and ducked with a laugh.</p>
<p>Rio’s lips almost curved, but she smothered it. Inside, though, she was both amused and unnerved. Agatha’s constant flirting was going to test her discipline harder than any battlefield had. Especially since Agatha had been her unattainable teenage fantasy, her wet dream. Now here she is just inches away.</p>
<p>Maria broke the moment with a professional smile. “If you run into anything you need and Rio isn’t available, please call or email me directly.” She touched Natasha’s arm with quiet affection before excusing herself.</p>
<p>Natasha swept the door open, her gaze scanning the hall. Old instincts never dulled. Rio moved to Agatha’s side, close enough that Agatha caught her scent—vanilla, fresh flowers, something grounding and impossibly warm. For the first time in months, Agatha’s teasing faded. Fear had been gnawing at her, even beneath her bravado, but Rio’s presence felt like armor.</p>
<p>The team moved in formation: Rio at the front, Natasha guarding the rear. Bucky and Yelena melted back into place, weapons on their hips, shadows of lethal intent. Agatha’s pulse spiked, not from fear this time, but from the dawning realization that she was no longer on her own, and that she was safe.</p>
<p>Wanda slipped her arm around her sister’s, squeezing gently. Agatha leaned into it, grateful for the unspoken reassurance.</p>
<p>Out back, two black SUVs idled. Alice stood alert before one, Clint before the other, both scanning rooftops and alleys. Rio steered Agatha toward Clint’s SUV, never breaking her watch of the surrounding buildings. She opened the back door without taking her eyes off the skyline.</p>
<p>Agatha slid in first, Wanda following, then Jen. Lilia lingered, hand on Billy’s shoulder. “We’ll take our own car, meet you at the house.” She gave Rio a curt nod before leading Billy away.</p>
<p>Rio climbed in beside Agatha, shutting the door with deliberate calm. Natasha took shotgun with Clint. Yelena and Bucky ran one last sweep before loading into the lead SUV with Alice.</p>
<p>The convoy rolled out, sleek and silent, the city swallowing them whole.</p>
<p>“Sooo,” Agatha finally broke the silence, her tone playful but edged with curiosity. “Tell me a bit about yourselves. If we’re going to spend the foreseeable future together, might as well get to know you. Maria said You’re all taken?”</p>
<p>In the front seat, Clint and Natasha shared a knowing glance. Clint caught Rio’s eyes in the rearview mirror, and Rio gave a subtle nod of approval.</p>
<p>Natasha went first, her voice even. “Maria and I have been married for ten years, and known each other for fifteen. Her unit was sent to take me out when I was still KGB. Instead, I fell in love with her and defected.” She simplified it, but her fond smile carried the weight of a lifetime.</p>
<p>“Well, if that didn’t come straight off BookTok, I don’t know what did,” Jen muttered. Agatha and Wanda both laughed.</p>
<p>Clint picked up next, tone measured but proud. “I’ve been married to my wife, Laura, for fifteen years. We met at the CIA. Natasha and I have known each other just as long—our paths crossed when the CIA partnered with MARSOC to try to take her down. Instead, we became best friends. Laura and I have three beautiful children.”</p>
<p>“Damn, congratulations,” Wanda said, impressed. Then her brow furrowed as she turned to Natasha. “Also, how dangerous are you that it took both the Marines and the CIA to try to stop you?”</p>
<p>Natasha only smirked, saying nothing.</p>
<p>All eyes drifted to Rio, who had been quietly scanning the surroundings, ever alert.</p>
<p>“What about you, hot stuff?” Agatha teased, leaning slightly toward her.</p>
<p>Jen didn’t even bother reaching for the spray bottle this time. She just sighed.</p>
<p>Rio kept her gaze on the street, voice clipped. “I’m not seeing anyone. I focus on my work.” Her tone left no cracks to pry into, but Agatha still smirked, storing that tidbit away.</p>
<p>Jen, trying to deflect the sudden tension, blurted out, “Is Alice single?”</p>
<p>The car went quiet. Every pair of eyes turned toward her. Jen’s cheeks flushed crimson.</p>
<p>“Hey! If I can’t sleep with hot stuff over here, you can’t sleep with Alice. That’s not fair,” Agatha protested, indignant.</p>
<p>Rio’s ears burned hot. She quickly looked away, but Natasha caught the flicker in her expression through the mirror and smirked knowingly.</p>
<p>“Technically,” Jen said slyly, “there’s nothing scandalous about me sleeping with security. They’re not protecting me.”</p>
<p>That got the reaction she wanted—Agatha lunged to swat her, but Wanda grabbed her arm with a sharp, “Sit down!”</p>
<p>The rest of the ride settled into a rhythm of small talk and stretches of silence, though Agatha kept sneaking glances at Rio, testing, waiting. Rio refused to bite, her eyes fixed on the job.</p>
<p>It was getting late by the time they finally reached Agatha’s estate. Natasha and Bucky hopped out first, manually opening the gates. Bucky covered her while she worked, scanning the sidewalk and nearby cars with sharp precision. Once the SUVs rolled through, Clint and Alice split off to begin their sweep.</p>
<p>The house loomed like something from a dream. Sleek and modern, but softened with gothic touches. Black-framed windows gleamed in the moonlight, while ivy curled up charcoal stone walls. Lights along the pathway cast a mystical glow. Out back, an infinity pool shimmered like molten silver, edged in black marble. An underground garage—newly installed—waited to shelter Agatha’s cars.</p>
<p>Rio’s chest tightened as she took it in. She wasn’t poor, but this level of wealth felt like another world. Still, she thought, the place suited Agatha perfectly—elegant, mysterious, and a little witchy.</p>
<p>Agatha moved to open her door, but Rio’s arm shot out, stopping her, bringing them in close, her voice low but firm.</p>
<p>“You stay in the car until the grounds are cleared.”</p>
<p>The sudden closeness caught Agatha off guard. Her breath hitched, eyes darting briefly to Rio’s lips. For once, words failed her. She only nodded dumbly, heat creeping up her neck.</p>
<p>Rio slipped out of the car, joining Clint while the rest of the team secured the perimeter.</p>
<p>Inside, Wanda smirked. “You are so down bad.”</p>
<p>“I am not,” Agatha snapped defensively. “I’m just… having fun. This is Lilia’s fault for hiring the most attractive people alive.”</p>
<p>“She’s not wrong,” Jen muttered, thinking of one particular red-streaked operative.</p>
<p>“They’re also killers,” Wanda reminded them flatly. “So maybe keep that in mind before you start planning weddings.”</p>
<p>“That only makes them hotter,” Agatha shot back with a smirk.</p>
<p>Wanda groaned. “There’s something seriously wrong with you.”</p>
<p>Before Agatha could retort, Rio opened the door. “It’s all clear, ma’am. Clint is reprogramming the gate access and checking for vulnerabilities. Alice and Bucky are replacing the cameras. Nat and Yelena are patrolling the grounds.”</p>
<p>Rio offered Agatha her hand. Agatha didn’t need the help, but she accepted it anyway. Her palm tingled at the contact, but she played it cool as they stepped out. Natasha stood guard at the entrance, eyes scanning every shadow.</p>
<p>The inside of the house matched the exterior’s grandeur. Open-concept, with soaring ceilings framed in dark oak beams etched with runes and celestial motifs. Stars, moons, witchy details woven into the architecture.</p>
<p>At Rio’s raised brow, Agatha chuckled. “They call me the Witch of Hollywood. Might as well own it.”</p>
<p>The living room opened around a sunken seating pit—midnight-blue cushions forming a circle that felt less like a lounge, more like a coven’s sanctum. To the side, a kitchen gleamed with marble counters veined in gold, old-oak tables, and lanterns that lent the space an enchanted farmhouse glow. It was unmistakably Agatha’s world.</p>
<p>Lilia and Billy arrived a few minutes later. Clint halted the SUV at the gate, allowing them to walk the rest of the way up the long drive. Meanwhile, Bucky drove Agatha’s old car several blocks away before calling a tow truck to have it impounded, getting rid of any trace of the previous compromised security detail.</p>
<p>Once everyone regrouped, Lilia joined Rio, Wanda, Jen, and Billy in the living room. The group circled the sunken seating area, the room’s ambient glow catching on the runes carved into the beams above.</p>
<p>Jen opened her tablet and began sharing Agatha’s schedule. “Tomorrow, Agatha’s on set to meet with the director for Coven of Chaos. They may also film a few scenes, depending on readiness. The rest of the week, there’s a photoshoot, plus several interviews, promotion for both Coven and Agnes of Westview.” She forwarded the schedule to Rio’s secure line, who accepted it with a curt nod, already running logistics in her head.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Rio said, voice even. “You’re free to roam the grounds and keep your routines, but if you plan to leave the property, you must inform me or one of my team first.”</p>
<p>Agatha scoffed lightly, crossing her arms, but didn’t argue. “Fine.” Her eyes tracked Rio as she continued. “I assume your team will take the spare rooms here?” Agatha asked, already knowing the answer but fishing for another exchange.</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am,” Rio confirmed. “We’ll remain onsite at all times. Will that be an issue?”</p>
<p>Agatha tilted her head, a smirk tugging at her lips. “Not at all. In fact, I rather like the idea.”</p>
<p>Rio ignored the implication. “Have a good night, ma’am. If you need anything, don’t hesitate to reach out to one of us.” She gave a short nod before excusing herself to check in with her team outside and getting away from the temptation that is Agatha Fucking Harkness.</p>
<p>Through the windows, Agatha could see Alice on a ladder, installing new night-vision cameras under the eaves. Motion sensors blinked red as they powered on, and Clint worked on securing access panels at the gate. The team moved with efficiency and quiet discipline, weaving their presence into the very bones of the property.</p>
<p>Agatha lingered by the glass, watching Rio’s silhouette in the courtyard as she briefed Bucky and Yelena. Her stance was steady, her voice low but firm. She commanded the space without even trying. Agatha sighed. She wasn’t used to longing; it felt ridiculous, almost juvenile. Yet the thought of Rio’s tattoos, her steady hands, her sharp eyes, sent Agatha to bed buzzing.</p>
<p>After Wanda, Jen, Lilia, and Billy left, each with a hug and a promise to check in, Agatha slipped into her nightly routine. The house was silent save for the faint shuffle of footsteps outside, her protectors settling in.</p>
<p>And yet, as Agatha slid beneath the sheets, her thoughts refused to quiet. All she could picture was Rio: the brush of her arm earlier, the way she smelled of vanilla and something wild, the doe eyed intensity behind her professionalism.</p>
<p>Agatha fell asleep with a smile on her lips, dreaming of the woman who now guarded her life.</p>

<p>It was barely 7 a.m. when Agatha stirred awake. Normally, the world knew better than to bother her before noon, or at least before two cups of coffee. But something had pulled her from her sleep, and wrapped in her silk robe, she padded downstairs, curiosity outweighing her irritation.</p><p>She froze at the window.</p><p>Outside, Rio was running the property line, dressed in only a sports bra and shorts. Morning light caught on the sheen of sweat across her toned stomach, illuminating the sharp lines of her abs, the curve of her shoulders, the sculpt of her traps. Tattoos wound down her arms and across her torso, ink etched into muscle like a story written on living marble.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth went dry. She was certain she was drooling. <em>Holy shit.</em> She already knew she’d need to change her underwear.</p><p>Rio slowed, instinct prickling. She turned and caught Agatha staring.</p><p>Agatha should have looked away. She <em>tried</em> to look away. Instead, her gaze lingered like a sinner locked in confession. Rio smirked faintly before turning toward the house, and panic jolted through Agatha. She spun too fast, pretending to be casual, only to slosh steaming coffee straight onto her chest.</p><p>“AHH!” she yelped.</p><p>The shout brought Bucky charging through the door, gun-hand twitching before he registered the scene: Agatha hopping in place, clutching her robe, cheeks redder than the burn. His eyes flicked to Rio jogging up the steps, then back to Agatha, and a slow, knowing smirk curved his lips.</p><p>“Ma’am.” He gave a polite nod before retreating, clearly entertained.</p><p>Agatha wanted to bury herself six feet under.</p><p>Rio entered, breath even despite the run, eyes scanning her quickly. “Everything alright, Ms. Harkness?”</p><p>“I told you, call me Agatha,” she huffed, trying for dignity while blotting coffee from silk. “And yes, I’m fine. Just annoyed I wasted a perfectly good cup.”</p><p>Then inspiration struck. Wicked inspiration.</p><p>With deliberate slowness, Agatha slipped the robe from her shoulders, letting it fall. She stood in nothing but boxer shorts, bare from the waist up.</p><p>Rio froze. Heat shot into her cheeks as her gaze darted anywhere but at Agatha. In one swift motion, she shrugged off the suit jacket she’d left draped over a barstool and thrust it at her, eyes still averted.</p><p>“Here.” Her voice was tight. “Put this on.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, triumphant. She slid into the jacket, far too big on her, drowning in Rio’s scent: vanilla, faint leather, and something wild.</p><p>“Thanks, hot stuff,” she purred, watching Rio’s ears turn scarlet. For once, she had cracked the unshakable soldier.</p><p>Agatha took the opportunity to drink her in up close. Rio’s tattoos were even more mesmerizing in detail: the oak tree with curling branches, the vines weaving across her stomach, the skulls and saints interlaced with military insignia. They weren’t just art. They were memory, history, devotion carved into skin.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, filing the questions away for later. Too soon to pry. But god, she wanted to know everything.</p><p>Rio finally risked a glance back at her. Their eyes met. Just for a moment.</p><p>And it was electric.</p><p>Agatha wrapped the oversized jacket tighter around herself, still smirking as she leaned against the counter. Rio was trying very hard to look at <em>anything</em> but her, the floor, the window, the coffee machine, the faint dusting of flour on the marble countertop, but her eyes kept darting back, betraying her.</p><p>“So,” Agatha drawled, her voice softer now, “do all bodyguards come with abs sculpted by the gods, or is that just a you thing?”</p><p>Rio pinched the bridge of her nose, exhaling. “Agatha—”</p><p>“Yes, darling?”</p><p>“You should… really put on a shirt,” Rio said, struggling to keep her composure. At this rate it's a toss-up on who will die first from gay panic, Agatha or Rio?</p><p>Agatha grinned, but it lacked her usual bite. She slid onto one of the stools, propping her chin on her hand. For once, she didn’t press further. “You know,” she murmured, “most people in my life don’t tell me what to do. They either kiss my ass or use me.”</p><p>Agatha grew up in Hollywood. Her first acting gig was when she was just a child and starred in the now cult classic Salemites. She has seen the dark side of Hollywood, lived it for a while. This industry has always been about eat or be eaten, everyone trying to outdo each other, and they don't care who they have to hurt in the process to do so. </p><p>Rio turned, caught off guard by the shift in tone. Agatha’s smirk had faded; in its place was a weariness Rio recognized all too well.</p><p>“I don’t really know what to do when someone looks me in the eye and says ‘no,’” Agatha admitted with a wry laugh. “Guess it’s… refreshing,” she shrugged</p><p>Rio leaned against the opposite counter, finally meeting her gaze. “I’m not here to use you. Or kiss your ass. My job is to keep you alive. That means telling you ‘no’ when I have to.”</p><p>“Cold, blunt, and devastatingly hot,” Agatha said, lips twitching into a small smile. But this time, there was no spray-bottle-worthy innuendo behind it, just honesty.</p><p>Rio shook her head, but she was smiling too, barely. “You make it very hard to do my job.”</p><p>“Well,” Agatha said, straightening, “maybe that’s because your job is to guard me, not… know me.” She hesitated, then asked, “Do you even want to know me, Rio? Or am I just another assignment to you?”</p><p>The question hung heavy between them.</p><p>Rio crossed her arms, the tattoos shifting with the motion. “You’re not ‘just another assignment.’ No one’s ever <em>just</em> that. I learn the people I protect, their habits, what makes them tick, and the way they react under pressure. It’s the only way to do this right.” She paused. “But. no. I don’t usually get to <em>know</em> them. Not like that.”</p><p>Agatha studied her, the silence stretching. For once, she didn’t fill it with quips. “Then maybe,” she said softly, “you should.”</p><p>Their eyes held, something unspoken settling between them. Not just attraction, not just the charged banter that made Jen want to drown her in holy water. This was the first thread of something deeper: trust.</p><p>Agatha broke the moment with a crooked smile. “But for the record, darling, you did look when you thought I wasn’t watching.”</p><p>Rio groaned and pushed off the counter, muttering, “You’re impossible.” But there was a faint, unmistakable warmth in her voice as she reached for the coffeemaker.</p><p>“Coffee?” she asked.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, genuinely touched. “I thought you’d never offer.”</p><p>And just like that, the tension eased into something new, something more fragile, but infinitely more real.</p><p>“Can I ask you a question, since we’re getting all real?” Agatha said jokingly, leaving Rio plenty of room to say no.</p><p>“Sure,” Rio replied. “I can’t promise an answer, though.”</p><p>“Why did you get into the bodyguarding business? I mean, you were Special Forces. Your skills could be used in so many different ways, why this?” Agatha asked sincerely.</p><p>Rio was quiet for a moment, weighing whether to be honest. But because Agatha had opened up, she decided she owed the same in return.</p><p>“I lost a lot of good people during my time in the force, as has anyone who’s served,” Rio began. “Then I was in an accident that led to a medical and honorable discharge. For a while, I wasn’t sure I’d even survive. A few months into recovery, I got word about the mission that killed my entire team. I wasn’t there to protect them, just like I wasn’t able to protect other people in my life when I was younger.</p><p>“So when I reconnected with Maria and we started talking, SHIELD was born. A way to use our skills to protect people who need it most. While we mainly cater to the elite, we also provide free services to battered women, people in domestic violence situations, and kids in dangerous homes. No one should ever feel like there’s no one in their corner.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her so tenderly that it made her chest ache with something she refused to name. Here was this perfect woman who had lost so much, yet still kept her heart intact and looked after the little guy. Without thinking, Agatha reached out and squeezed Rio’s hand. Their eyes locked, and for a long moment neither of them moved.</p><p>Then Yelena walked in.</p><p>Both women jerked apart like they’d been burned. Yelena looked between them, a smirk tugging at her lips. “Do I need my own spray bottle?”</p><p>Rio grabbed the closest object at hand—a banana—and lobbed it at her. Yelena caught it easily, peeled it, and took a bite without missing a beat.</p><p>“Jen and Billy are on their way up to get Agatha ready for the day,” Yelena said, voice lilting with amusement. “I suggest you both go put on appropriate clothes.” With that, she spun on her heel and went to relieve Natasha on perimeter duty.</p><p>Agatha and Rio shared one last glance before they retreated to their respective bedrooms to change. Rio knew today would be their first real test: paparazzi, fans, the public eye. She couldn’t let the quiet intimacy of the kitchen conversation cloud her focus.</p><p>By the time she was ready, Rio was back in her suit, weapon concealed beneath the jacket. When she entered the kitchen, Jen and Billy were already at the counter, scrolling through social media feeds to check for any negative press. They looked up, exchanged pleasantries, and went back to work.</p><p>A few minutes later, Agatha descended the stairs, freshly showered and dressed in dark jeans, a crisp white button-up, and sunglasses perched casually on top of her head. While she looks completely casual, Rio thinks she belongs on every Billboard in Hollywood with how good she looks. </p><p>Rio’s eyes lingered a beat too long, and Agatha caught her. She smiled cockily, like she’d chosen her outfit specifically to drive Rio mad, and knowing Agatha, she probably had.</p><p>“Good, you’re finally here,” Jen said, glancing up from her phone. “We need to be at the studio in forty-five minutes. Press is quiet for now, just a few blurry shots of you walking into SHIELD yesterday. Some fan speculation, a little concern about what you were doing there, but nothing damaging.”</p><p>“I want all press routed to Alice,” Rio said firmly, stepping into command. “She’s monitoring social media right now and running every picture of Agatha through a database to flag repeat appearances. If the same face keeps showing up in different crowds, we’ll know.</p><p>“Jen, Billy, your focus is online chatter. I want you to scan for anything that negatively mentions Agatha or gives you a bad feeling. Alice is already filtering, but you two live and breathe social media. Jen, you’ve got the eye for bad press, and Billy, you know fan behavior better than anyone. If you see something suspicious, even if it feels small, flag it immediately. Understood?”</p><p>Both nodded quickly, determination written across their faces.</p><p>Rio continued, crisp and commanding. “Myself, Bucky, Clint, and Natasha will escort Agatha today. Yelena and Alice will remain here to finish installing the new systems, monitor the grounds, and keep watch online.”</p><p>Finally, Rio turned her attention fully to Agatha. Her voice softened, but the steel never left it. “Agatha, I need you to listen to everything we tell you today. It’s easier working with us than against us, and it will go much more smoothly for you.”</p><p>Agatha sipped her coffee, her 3rd of the day, watching Rio over the rim of her mug. “You know,” she drawled, “for someone who insists on calling me <em>Ms. Harkness,</em> you sure boss me around like we’re married already.”</p><p>Jen snorted into her drink and wished she had brought her spray bottle with her. </p><p>Rio gave her a look, part exasperation, part warning, but Agatha just smirked, eyes gleaming. Still, beneath the tease, there was a softer current, leftover from their moment in the kitchen. Agatha didn’t push this time, letting the silence speak for her.</p><p>“Car will be ready in ten,” Rio said briskly, returning to business. “Clint will drive, and Natasha, Bucky, and I will run point. We’ll coordinate entry with the studio’s security, but my team will handle transport door to door, and I will be with you all day. We called ahead to the studio, and apparently, there is already a large group gathering for you.”</p><p>“Sounds very official,” Agatha teased, setting her mug down and leaning against the counter, a little too close to Rio. “Should I practice my serious face?”</p><p>“You should practice listening when I say move,” Rio countered dryly, but there was the faintest tug of a smile at the corner of her mouth. She quickly wipes it away and leaves to get her comms from Alice and get the car ready.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>By the time the black SUVs reached the studio lot, the sidewalks were already overflowing. Fans pressed against barricades, cameras flashing, voices rising in a chorus of screams, the second Agatha’s car pulled into view. The paparazzi swarmed like vultures, jostling for the best shot. Usually, there aren't as many people at the studio, but because Agatha has been away from the spotlight for a few months, fans have all come for the opportunity to see the Legend. </p><p>“God, I hate mornings,” Agatha muttered, adjusting her sunglasses.</p><p>“You’ll hate this one more,” Rio said from beside her, calm but watchful. “Stay close. We’ll clear a path.”</p><p>Jen craned her neck to peek out the tinted window. “Well, at least you’re still loved. Half those signs have your name on them. And your face. And, uh… some very creative fan art.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “What can I say? America’s lesbian sweetheart.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer. Her eyes tracked every movement outside, the restless crowd, the paparazzi stepping into the street, even the man in the back wearing a ballcap too low over his face. Clint, Nat, and Bucky exit the car</p><p>Clint’s voice crackled in her earpiece. <em>“Crowd’s heavier than expected. Natasha and I are already sweeping the entry. Bucky is flanking left.”</em></p><p>“Copy,” Rio said. She glanced at Agatha. “When we move, you do exactly as I say. No detours. No autographs.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Darling, you’re no fun.”</p><p>“You’ll thank me when you’re not crushed by a hundred screaming fans,” Rio deadpanned.</p><p>The door opened, and noise slammed into the SUV like a tidal wave. Bucky appeared first, scanning the crowd, then motioned. Rio slid out, her body automatically shifting into shield position as she offered her hand to Agatha.</p><p>The moment Agatha stepped onto the pavement, chaos erupted. Flashes exploded. Fans screamed her name. Paparazzi surged forward, shouting questions about her new film, her “mystery security detail,” and even started asking about whether the woman in the suit at her side was more than just a bodyguard, trying to get any reaction out of the star</p><p>Agatha flashed her trademark smile, waving as if the chaos were a red carpet. She leans in close to Rio, using the excuse that she needs to be heard over the loud fans. “If I’m going to be mobbed, at least I’ll look good doing it.”</p><p>Rio tightened her stance, moving them forward in a bubble of controlled force. The team fell into perfect formation: Bucky and Natasha ahead, parting the sea of bodies; Clint covering the rear; Rio sweeping for threats with eagle eyes.</p><p>A fan broke past the barrier, lunging forward with a phone extended. Rio intercepted instantly, one hand gripping Agatha’s waist to pull her out of reach while Bucky stepped in and redirected the man back toward lot security with a glare.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched—half surprise, half something else—as Rio’s arm remained firm around her. She recovered quickly, plastering on a dazzling smile for the cameras. “Darling, if you wanted to hold me, you could’ve just asked,” she whispered against Rio’s ear.</p><p>“Not the time,” Rio muttered, jaw tight, keeping her eyes peeled and refusing to let Agatha get under her skin</p><p>By the time they reached the studio entrance, Agatha was laughing, sunglasses tilted just so for the cameras. To the world, she looked untouchable, radiant. But as soon as the heavy doors slammed shut behind them, muffling the roar of the crowd, her shoulders sagged.</p><p>“That,” she admitted quietly, “was… actually terrifying.” She has been mobbed by fans before, but this felt worse, maybe because of the stalker problem, or maybe she isn't as used to this as she lets on.</p><p>Rio studied her for a moment, then nodded. “And that was with a controlled perimeter. The stalker hasn’t shown themselves yet. Which means they’re waiting.”</p><p>Agatha met her gaze, the mask slipping just long enough to reveal the fear beneath. But Rio’s steady presence, the lingering warmth of her hand at her waist, grounded her.</p><p>“Well,” Agatha said finally, forcing her smirk back into place, “good thing I have my very own squad of assassins, isn’t it?”</p><p>From behind them, Natasha smirked. “You’re welcome.”</p><p>On set, everything went smoothly. Director Peggy Carter was more than willing to cooperate with Rio’s team, and together they laid out a plan to ensure the chaos from outside wouldn’t happen again. Bucky and Natasha stayed posted at the studio entrance, Clint kept a sharp eye from outside, tracking every movement, and Rio remained by Agatha’s side, never crowding her, but never far enough that she couldn’t step in at a moment’s notice.</p><p>No filming was scheduled for the day. Instead, Agatha spent hours in meetings with wardrobe, hair, and makeup, and the production team, prep work for the upcoming week when shooting would officially begin. By the time they wrapped, the sun was setting. Outside, the mob had thinned considerably. Only the most desperate paparazzi lingered, and the fans had long since dispersed after catching a glimpse of their beloved star.</p><p>Back at the house, Agatha finally sagged, letting the mask of untouchable celebrity slip away. Within the safety of her home, she could exhale.</p><p>Rio checked in with Yelena and Alice. Other than a few photographers Yelena had to chase off, the day had been uneventful. The new security system was officially online, every sensor and camera in place, and Alice was still combing through the internet. She’d even started comparing wording from the stalker’s letters to online posts, hoping to catch a digital trail.</p><p>Jen headed out for the night, but Billy stayed, retreating to one of the spare bedrooms to FaceTime his boyfriend, Eddie.</p><p>Rio eventually found Agatha in the kitchen, scrolling through her phone.</p><p>“Have you eaten anything today besides catering?” Rio asked, though she already knew the answer.</p><p>Agatha looked up with a smile and shook her head.</p><p>“I can make fideos,” Rio offered. “Puerto Rican comfort food. My mom used to make it all the time when I was growing up.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened dramatically. “So let me get this straight, you’re badass, protective, fit, covered in tattoos, <em>and</em> you can cook? You’re the perfect woman.” She sighed theatrically, like she was lovesick.</p><p>Rio shook her head with a fond smile as she moved to gather ingredients. “Anyone ever tell you you’re an annoying menace to society?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “No. Why have you heard something?” She laughed, then added, “You don’t have to cook, though. I usually just order takeout, watch trash TV, and then crash.”</p><p>“It’s my job to protect you,” Rio countered, pouring oil into a pan. “That includes protecting you from starvation and a terrible diet. Besides,” she tossed noodles into the pan with practiced ease “I like cooking.”</p><p>Agatha leaned her elbows on the counter, chin in hand, watching her every move. “Careful, darling. You keep cooking for me and saving my life, so I’ll have to marry you. Those are the rules of the universe.”</p><p>Rio smirked, shaking her head as she stirred the noodles until they browned. “Those are the rules, huh?”</p><p>“Unbreakable,” Agatha said with a grin. Rio shook her head with a small smile. </p><p>“Do you like spicy?” Rio asked, sprinkling in seasoning.</p><p>“It depends. I can handle it, but not, like, devil’s-anus-level spice.”</p><p>Rio laughed, an unrestrained, warm laugh that made Agatha’s heart squeeze. She swore she’d do anything to hear that sound again.</p><p>Content, Agatha pulled her phone back out and scrolled through social media, chuckling. “You know,” she said, “you’ve got your own little fandom growing.”</p><p>Rio raised a brow. Agatha grinned and started reading aloud.</p><p><b>@AgathasWhore:</b> Who are the hotties guarding Agatha? #Agatha #AgathasBodyguards<br/><b>@SlvtforAgatha:</b> Did she hire her new security off a runway? Most attractive security I’ve ever seen. #AgathasBodyguards<br/><b>@AgathasCoven:</b> The woman in the suit can throw me into traffic, and I’d thank her.<br/><b>@AgnesO’Connor:</b> Agatha’s new bodyguard could stab me with her jawline, and I’d apologize for existing in her space.<br/><b>@WitchyAgatha:</b> Did you see how protective she was? Surprised no one dropped dead from that glare. Love me a protective baddie. If I were Agatha, I’d be jumping her bones.<br/><b>@CallMeDaddy:</b> Step on me, hot bodyguard. I’ll call you Daddy. #Daddy #Protectmybody</p><p>By now, Agatha was doubled over, laughing so hard she had tears in her eyes. “And those are the <em>tame</em> ones,” she said between giggles. “You do <em>not</em> want me to read the graphic ones.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flamed red. “Your fans are freaks.”</p><p>Agatha leaned closer, voice dropping into a purr. “Well, so am I, darling. Maybe one day you’ll let me show you just how much.”</p><p>Rio nearly dropped the plates she was carrying but managed to set them down before she embarrassed herself. She made sure to leave enough for the others before sliding into the seat beside Agatha.</p><p>Agatha took one bite and let out a low, sinful moan. “Oh my god. I would marry you for this dish alone. This is the best thing I’ve ever eaten in my life.”</p><p>Rio shifted uncomfortably, the sound hitting her like a live wire. She swallowed hard. “Thank you,” was all she managed.</p><p>They ate side by side, conversation light, the silence between them comfortable. Agatha felt something she rarely did: safe. She’d never had a family: her mother was a nightmare, her father a ghost, no siblings to speak of. The closest thing to family is the one she’d built, consisting of Wanda, Lilia, Billy, and even Jen. But sharing a quiet meal, watching Rio laugh, tasting food cooked just for her. it was something she’d never experienced.</p><p>For the first time, she felt like she had a home. And she found herself wanting many more nights just like this.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>The next morning, Agatha had a full-day photoshoot scheduled for a magazine spread, promotion for both her upcoming film, </span><em><span>Coven of Chaos</span></em><span>, and her last detective series, </span><em><span>Agnes of Westview.</span></em><span> It promised to be grueling. Some of the shots were supposed to capture the dark romance of the show, where Agatha played a small-town cop tracking down a serial killer—who also happened to be her wife, portrayed by Wanda. With Wanda in New York for a chemistry read and unable to attend, the magazine hired a stand-in model. Agatha, of course, had already decided she would use the opportunity to get some sort of reaction out of Rio.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, Rio sat with her team in the living room, and Clint was stationed outside at the gate on guard duty. The morning briefing was focused and sharp: reviewing yesterday’s mob incident, fine-tuning tactics, and running through scenarios for when the stalker made their next move.</span></p><p><span>Alice scrolled through data on her laptop. “Have you talked to Agatha about anyone she might suspect? An ex, a bad fan interaction, anyone she’s pissed off?”</span></p><p><span>Rio sighed. “Unfortunately, the list is long. Agatha’s a known womanizer. She has a trail of one-night stands all over the globe, any of whom could be bitter. And her fans? Many are parasocial and obsessive. It’s hard to narrow it down. But I did get a list of all the women Agatha remembers sleeping with and sent it to you to cross-check for red flags.”</span></p><p><span>Yelena, draped lazily across the couch with a knife spinning expertly between her fingers, smirked. “You gonna add your name to that list?”</span></p><p><span>“What? No. Absolutely not.” Rio’s voice hitched. “Agatha is my client. I do not sleep with my clients.”</span></p><p><span>Alice didn’t even glance up as she added fuel to the fire. “It’s not every day your client happens to be Agatha Harkness—aka your celebrity crush since you were twelve.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha leaned back, smirking. “And let’s be honest, Agatha isn’t going to stop until she gets what she wants. She’s stubborn like that.”</span></p><p><span>“Stubborn is putting it lightly,” Bucky muttered from his corner, where he was trying to become one with the wall. “She’s been ready to jump your bones since the moment she saw you. And she’s not exactly subtle about it.”</span></p><p><span>Rio scrubbed a hand over her face. “She doesn’t actually like me. She’s just flirty that’s who she is. It’s not real.”</span></p><p><span>Every pair of eyes in the room turned toward her like she’d grown a second head.</span></p><p><span>“Are you dumb?” Yelena asked flatly, looking genuinely concerned.</span></p><p><span>Rio bristled. “I </span><em><span>know</span></em><span> she wants to sleep with me. But it’s just sex for her. She doesn’t actually like me like that.”</span></p><p><span>Alice snorted. “Okay. Keep telling yourself that, bud.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha arched a brow. “Why are you so against it, anyway? It’s not against company policy.”</span></p><p><span>“I know it’s not,” Rio snapped. “I wrote the damn policy. But it’s my personal rule. It’s unprofessional. Crossing that line could ruin the company’s reputation. And I’m the Co-CEO. I don’t get the luxury of being careless.”</span></p><p><span>The room fell quiet, but the looks exchanged around her made it clear no one was buying her excuse. They were able to finish the rest of the meeting without a hitch and went back to their respective duties. </span></p><p><span>Today, only Rio would be escorting Agatha. Natasha would handle the driving and remain with the vehicle, while Bucky had already gone ahead to the lot earlier that morning to coordinate with studio security. He’d ensured Agatha would arrive and depart through a back entrance, safely out of reach of paparazzi or fans.</span></p><p><span>Agatha finally came downstairs around noon, finding Billy and Jen in the kitchen as usual. The scent of food greeted her, and she quickly noticed Rio had already made breakfast for them.</span></p><p><span>“Your breakfast and coffee are on the counter to the right of the stove,” Rio said without turning, her voice calm and steady. She didn’t need to look to know Agatha was there; she had felt the subtle shift in the air, the almost imperceptible presence that followed Agatha everywhere.</span></p><p><span>Jen and Billy jerked their heads up, startled. Neither of them had heard Agatha enter. Agatha only smirked.</span></p><p><span>“You’ve got spidey senses or something?” she teased, amused but secretly touched. She rarely ate an actual breakfast, usually grabbing just a cup of coffee before being rushed out the door. The simple gesture wasn’t lost on her.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t bite at the joke. She simply turned, clean and precise as ever, and began to lay out the plan for the day. Agatha nodded when appropriate, but the words themselves barely registered.</span></p><p><span>Because already, without even realizing when it had happened, Agatha trusted Rio completely. And that was something she had never allowed herself to do so quickly with anyone before.</span></p><p><span>They arrived at the photoshoot with plenty of time to spare. Thanks to Bucky’s groundwork, no screaming fans or paparazzi were waiting outside, but Rio remained on alert all the same. She led Agatha, Billy, and Jen inside, her sharp eyes scanning the building’s layout—exits, cameras, blind spots, while committing the face of every passerby to memory with clinical precision.</span></p><p><span>The photographer hurried up to greet them, his smile wide but a little strained. Rio caught the nervous twitch in his movements. Whether it was her presence unsettling him or something else, she couldn’t be sure, but she cataloged it all the same.</span></p><p><span>“Ms. Harkness,” he said, his voice warm but slightly unsteady. “Thank you so much for being here. It’s an honor to photograph you today. One of my assistants will take you to wardrobe and hair and makeup, and then we’ll begin with solo shots before moving on to the duo.”</span></p><p><span>He was short, with wavy brown hair that hung low over his eyes, so low Agatha had to resist the biting urge to ask how he even saw through a camera lens. She smirked to herself but refrained, just this once.</span></p><p><span>With a practiced nod, Agatha let the assistants guide her away. This was routine to her, the constant cycle of wardrobe, makeup, hair, and then posing for someone else’s vision. Jen stayed behind to talk with the photographer and the magazine editor about scheduling, promo, and release dates.</span></p><p><span>Rio, as always, followed Agatha, eyes flicking to every doorway, every hallway, every unfamiliar face. She walked with the quiet precision of someone who expected danger to slip out of the shadows at any moment.</span></p><p><span>The first outfit was a statement in itself. A black-and-white striped button-up, casually rolled at the sleeves, the collar left open for just enough relaxed charm. The pants were high-waisted black leather, quilted at the thighs with gold button accents—a fusion of sleek luxury and biker-edge toughness.</span></p><p><span>Rio said nothing from her spot outside the door, but her eyes betrayed the briefest flicker of appreciation before they snapped back to scanning the halls.</span></p><p><span>The first round of solo shots wrapped without a hitch. Agatha had slipped easily into her public persona: smirks, tilted chins, the effortless aura of a woman who owned every inch of the lens.</span></p><p><span>After a few more outfit changes and more solo shoots, which also went flawlessly, Agatha brought the perfect amount of sultry, flirty, and professional. Rio watched from the sidelines, resisting the urge to just watch Agatha, but she was able to remain professional and stay alert. </span></p><p><span>But when it came time for the duo shots, a quiet ripple of panic went through the crew. The stand-in model had called in sick at the last minute.</span></p><p><span>The photographer wrung his hands. “We can reschedule—”</span></p><p><span>“Absolutely not,” Agatha cut in smoothly, already slipping into problem-solving mode. “I cleared my schedule for this, and I will not be available for a few months, plus we can't waste this perfect lighting. We’ll find a replacement.”</span></p><p><span>The assistant stammered, “W-we don’t have anyone else prepped—”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes gleamed as they slid over to Rio.</span></p><p><span>“Oh no,” Rio said immediately, already reading her mind. “Absolutely not. I’m not a model. I’m your bodyguard.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha sauntered toward her, already dressed in her second look: an all-black suit, no shirt beneath the jacket, the low plunge leaving nothing to the imagination. “Darling,” she purred, “you’re gorgeous, intimidating, and already in uniform. You’re perfect.”</span></p><p><span>Rio crossed her arms. “Agatha, I’m not here to play dress-up for a magazine spread.” She holds firm; she can't be in a magazine. Her work is behind the scenes, not in front of the camera.</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned closer, her smirk wicked. “I’ll behave for the rest of the week if you do this one little thing for me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw clenched. “That’s a lie, and we both know it.”</span></p><p><span>“True,” Agatha admitted with a laugh. “But it’ll be </span><em><span>fun.</span></em><span>” She tilted her head, lower lip caught between her teeth. “Please? For me?” Rio refused to look at her, knowing that if she does, she would relent.</span></p><p><span>The crew was staring now, waiting. Jen, traitorous as ever, piped up from the sidelines. “She’d look great on camera.” </span></p><p><span>Rio shot her a withering glare and made a mental note to put sand in Jens' coffee. She can't believe Jen is on board with this, but Agatha clasped her hands dramatically, eyes wide and pleading. “Pretty please, gorgeous? My stalker may get me at some point, don’t deny me this simple joy today.”</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned. “That is manipulative.”</span></p><p><span>“And effective,” Agatha replied with a grin.</span></p><p><span>“And I would never allow that to happen,” Rio said, but she already knows she lost the battle and sighs, preparing herself for the torture she's about to endure and the reactions from the team when they find out she agreed to this.</span></p><p><span>Minutes later, Rio was standing stiffly in front of the backdrop, jacket reluctantly removed. The white button-up hugged her shoulders and chest in a way that made Agatha’s breath catch, and the black slacks emphasized every clean line of her form. Her sleeves rolled up, showcasing the tattoos that drive Agatha mad. </span></p><p><span>Agatha, of course, looked like sin incarnate in her plunging black suit.</span></p><p><span>The photographer, now revitalized, clapped his hands. “Perfect! The contrast is striking—dark and light, dominance and restraint.”</span></p><p><span>Rio muttered under her breath, “Kill me now.”</span></p><p><span>“Not before the pictures, darling,” Agatha whispered back, her voice like velvet.</span></p><p><span>The poses started simple, and Agatha and the photographer helped Rio relax and not look like she's being held at gunpoint, but if you asked Rio, she prefers that:</span></p><p><span> Agatha put a hand on Rio’s arm, both facing the camera. Agatha leaned into Rio’s space, lips inches from her ear, a wicked smirk tugging at her mouth.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t blush,” Agatha teased softly. “The camera will catch it.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s ears turned pink anyway.</span></p><p><span>“Closer,” the photographer urged. “Yes, yes—Agatha, angle your chin down. Rio, look at her like you’re about to stop her from running.”</span></p><p><span>Rio did, and the room went quiet. The glare she gave wasn’t just protective, it was hungry, fierce. Agatha’s lips parted, her smirk faltering for the first time all day.</span></p><p><span>The next pose had Rio behind Agatha, one hand at her waist, pulling her back against her chest. Agatha let out a low, pleased hum that only Rio could hear. Rio had to use every bit of self-restraint she had not to moan at the sound and how good it felt having Agatha pressed up against her. </span></p><p><span>“You’re enjoying this too much,” Rio muttered.</span></p><p><span>“And you’re fighting it too much,” Agatha countered, voice silky.</span></p><p><span>The photographer snapped away, delighted. “That’s it! That tension is electric!”</span></p><p><span>For the final shot, Agatha had turned fully toward Rio, a hand braced on her chest, their eyes locked in a battle of wills. Both of them were breathing harder than the lights should warrant.</span></p><p><span>“Perfect,” the photographer whispered, lowering his camera. “That’s the cover.”</span></p><p><span>The spell broke. Rio stepped back immediately, reaching for her jacket like it was a lifeline. Agatha, however, only smirked, adjusting her suit casually as if she hadn’t just unraveled her bodyguard in front of a dozen people.</span></p><p><span>“Darling,” she purred, “if you ever quit this whole saving my life thing, you’ve got a career in modeling.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shot her a glare, but her flushed cheeks betrayed her. Agatha filed the reaction away, savoring it like a victory.</span></p><p><span>The photographer practically bounced on his heels, giddy with excitement. He couldn’t believe his luck. This shoot was ten times better than it would have been with the stand-in model.</span></p><p><span>“That was incredible,” he gushed. “The tension, the push and pull. You two captured the exact longing and conflict from the show. Honestly, your acting chops are better than I expected. My publisher is going to be </span><em><span>very</span></em><span> pleased.” Agatha smirked, right “acting”</span></p><p><span>He shook Agatha’s hand vigorously, holding on a bit too long and too roughly. Rio stepped in, placing a steadying hand on Agatha’s shoulder while gently but firmly prying the photographer away with a glare that can melt ice.</span></p><p><span>Billy appeared at Agatha’s side, handing her a water bottle, a granola bar, and a towel to dab at the sweat on her brow.</span></p><p><span>Before she could thank him, Jen swooped in with a mischievous grin and a spray bottle, spritzing both Agatha </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> Rio in the face.</span></p><p><span>“You two need to leave room for Jesus,” she scolded.</span></p><p><span>Rio snatched the bottle out of her hand, glaring as she tossed it in the trash.</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted. “You don’t even believe in Jesus, you witch.”</span></p><p><span>Jen only shrugged, completely unbothered.</span></p><p><span>“This photoshoot alone is going to skyrocket publicity,” she said excitedly. “I can already see it trending across social media. This is exactly the kind of buzz we needed for your next film, Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>She was right, Agatha’s sapphic fanbase was going to </span><em><span>lose their collective minds</span></em><span> over the images, especially given the heat that had radiated off the set. And Rio, whether she wanted to admit it or not, was quickly building her own following after just a handful of photos at Agatha’s side had hit the internet the day before.</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked, sipping her water as if she hadn’t just rewritten the trajectory of her press cycle. Rio, meanwhile, stood stoic beside her—only the faintest flush on her cheeks betraying that she knew exactly how much trouble this photoshoot was about to cause.</span></p><p><span>Before anyone could say anything else, Natasha’s voice cut through the comms, urgent and breathless.</span></p><p><em><span>“<strong>We might have a situation. Secure Agatha. Possible stalker sighting. I’m in pursuit.”</strong></span></em></p><p><span>The sound of her running echoed in the background.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t hesitate. She grabbed Agatha’s hand and pulled her toward the dressing room. Billy and Jen stumbled after them, panic already rising in their voices.</span></p><p><span>“What’s going on?!” Agatha demanded, startled.</span></p><p><span>“Just move. Stay in this room and drag the desk in front of the door. Open it for no one except me, you understand?” Rio barked, pushing them all inside once she’d cleared the space. She shut the door, weapon drawn, then turned to the gawking crew and ushered them away from the hallway. The urgency in her voice sent them scattering.</span></p><p><span>Inside the dressing room, Agatha tried to steady her breathing. Jen looked rattled, and Billy looked like he might cry.</span></p><p><span>“Is it the stalker?” Billy asked, his voice trembling.</span></p><p><span>“I don’t know,” Jen said quickly, forcing calm into her tone. “But Rio and Natasha can handle it.”</span></p><p><span>A gunshot cracked in the distance. They all jumped. Another followed. And then another.</span></p><p><span>The next fifteen minutes stretched into an eternity, heavy and silent. Agatha’s mind spun with possibilities, her chest tight with dread. Not knowing was worse than anything. Every sound from the hallway made her flinch, every second without news felt like it might break her.</span></p><p><span>Then, finally, a knock.</span></p><p><span>“It’s me. You can open the door now.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s voice.</span></p><p><span>Relief hit all three of them like a tidal wave. They shoved the desk aside and threw open the door. Agatha didn’t think; she just launched herself at Rio, arms wrapping around her in a desperate hug.</span></p><p><span>Rio was unharmed. Thank god.</span></p><p><span>Behind her, Agatha spotted Yelena and Bucky, newly arrived and tense, weapons still in hand. They scanned the hall in tight formation, eyes sharp, bodies coiled like springs.</span></p><p><span>“What happened? Where’s Natasha?” Agatha asked, pulling back just enough to look at Rio’s face.</span></p><p><span>“I’ll answer your questions, but first, we need to get you in the car.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s tone left no room for argument. She moved quickly, escorting Agatha and the others out. Bucky and Yelena closed in around them, bodies forming an impenetrable shield.</span></p><p><span>At the SUV, Rio opened the door for Agatha. Bucky and Yelena angled themselves to block every sightline until Agatha was safely inside. They got in the front seat and took off. </span></p><p><span>“Alright,” Agatha snapped the moment the door shut, her voice sharp with fear and frustration. “Now spill. What the hell just happened? Was it the stalker? We heard gunshots! Is Natasha okay?”</span></p><p><span>Rio slid in beside her, her calm steadiness a stark contrast to the chaos. “While Natasha was watching the vehicles, she spotted a man she vaguely recognized from yesterday. He approached and tried to place something under one of the cars. She confronted him, and he bolted. She pursued. A few blocks out, he turned and opened fire. She dodged, returned fire, and clipped his shoulder, but he had a car waiting. He got away.</span></p><p><span>“But Natasha got a good enough look at him to describe him, and he left DNA at the scene. She’s giving her statement now and collecting the blood sample so we can run it through our system.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha, Jen, and Billy stared, wide-eyed.</span></p><p><span>“Do you think it was the stalker?” Jen asked quietly.</span></p><p><span>“I think it’s very likely,” Rio said. “Either the stalker himself or someone they hired. Either way, we’re closer to finding them.”</span></p><p><span>Billy swallowed. “What did he try to put on the car?”</span></p><p><span>“A tracking device,” Rio explained. “The old vehicles you used were covered in them. I suspect he wanted to tag the new ones so they could track your every move and set up an ambush. Natasha stopped him before he attached it. We recovered it nearby.”</span></p><p><span>Jen straightened, her publicist instincts kicking in. “I’ll monitor the press. We cannot let this story get out. If the media learns Agatha has a stalker, it could embolden the stalker to act more publicly. This has to stay contained. I will talk to the crew at the photo shoot and try and keep them quiet.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded. “We already have feelers out to hospitals, clinics, even morgues. Anyone showing up with a gunshot wound to the right shoulder will be flagged immediately.”</span></p><p><span>Her voice softened as she reached over and squeezed Agatha’s hand. “You’re safe.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha hadn’t realized she’d been holding her breath. She squeezed Rio’s hand back, anchoring herself in the warmth of her touch.</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked outside and realized they weren't headed to her house like she thought they were, “Where are we going? My house is the other way.” </span></p><p><span>“For tonight, you will be staying at my house. Alice has picked up someone trying to interfere with the systems, and a drone was flying above the house, while I'm sure that was just the paps, Clint still shot it down. Until we are sure they can't penetrate the security, you will stay at mine, it should only be for the night, maybe two nights at the max. Yelena and Bucky will drop us off at mine, bring Jen and Billy to your place, and will guard the house like you are still there.” Rio informed.</span></p><p><span>Twenty minutes later, they pull up to Rio’s penthouse. Jen and Agatha’s jaws drop. “YOU'RE RICH?!” Agatha exclaimed shocked</span></p><p><span>“I am a CEO, Agatha, and I still have earnings from my time in the service. I don't spend my money on many things,” Rio smirked, glad to finally be the one to catch Agatha off guard.</span></p><p><span>Rio opens the car door for Agatha and gets out, taking Agatha's hand and helping her out of the car. Yelena nods at Rio, and she shuts the door, and they drive off, leaving the two on the sidewalk. Rio patches in her security code, and the gate opens, allowing the two entry. </span></p><p><span>The moment Agatha stepped inside, she froze.</span></p><p><span>Her eyes swept upward, following the sheer wall of glass that stretched two stories high, capturing the entire skyline like a painting. The sunlight poured in, catching on polished wood, steel, and glass, making everything gleam. The telescope by the window, the sectional sofa, the sharp lines softened by plants scattered artfully around the space, it all screamed understated elegance, and was very Rio.</span></p><p><span>“This is your place?” Agatha finally said, her voice climbing in pitch as she spun slowly in a circle, drinking it all in. “You’ve been hiding a Bond-villain lair this whole time and didn’t think to mention it?” Agatha said, still shocked, she never would have taken Rio to live luxuriously. </span></p><p><span>Rio gave her the smallest, faintest smile. “It’s just an apartment.”</span></p><p><span>“Just an apartment,” Agatha repeated, her jaw dropping dramatically. She gestured toward the ceiling, then the glass, the plants spilling over in the corner like they’d been styled by a magazine editor. “This is </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> just an apartment. This is a magazine spread. This is Architectural Digest. This is-” she trailed off, pressing a hand to her chest. “This is </span><em><span>so unfair.</span></em><span> You’re already a heavily tattooed, protective lesbian who can cook like a dream, and now I find out you live in the chic modern dream loft of my gay little fantasies?”</span></p><p><span>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Gay little fantasies?”</span></p><p><span>“Yes!” Agatha cried, striding dramatically into the living room. “Do you know where I live? A glorified witchy museum where everything is black and brooding and smells faintly of incense. Meanwhile, you’re up here in the clouds like some stoic goddess of light, with a rainforest scattered around your floor plan!” She bent over and inspected one of the plants with exaggerated seriousness. “And they’re </span><em><span>alive,</span></em><span> Rio. Do you know how many plants I’ve killed?”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked faintly. “Probably all of them.” She is finding much enjoyment in Agatha’s reaction. It's like Agatha is forgetting she lives in a multimillion-dollar mansion with a private arcade, a movie theater, a bowling alley, and an infinity pool, but Rio won't mention that right now; she's much too amused. </span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>All of them!</span></em><span>” Agatha shouted, throwing her hands up. “And now you’re telling me you can keep these leafy little bastards thriving while also saving my life from deranged stalkers?!” She stalked over to the couch, flopping down and spreading her arms wide. “That’s it. I live here now. You can’t stop me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio sighed, but her lips twitched like she was fighting a smile. “You have your own house.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes, but does my house have this view?” Agatha countered, pointing out the window. “No. No, it does not. And the universe clearly wants me here with you. I mean, look at this sofa. Look at it! It’s begging for a tragic lesbian to faint across it while being comforted by her stoic, mysterious protector.” She collapsed into the cushions to demonstrate, her head lolling back dramatically.</span></p><p><span>Rio shook her head, but when Agatha peeked up at her, she swore she saw the faintest blush at the tips of her ears.</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked. Oh yes. Tonight is going to be fun. </span></p><p><span>Rio ignored Agatha’s dramatics and moved to arm every security feature of the house. Her movements were automatic, practiced, a ritual of safety that she could never forgo. Somewhere in the back of her mind, she thought of Maria looking after her tarantula, Victoria—something Maria had agreed to </span><em><span>very</span></em><span> reluctantly while Rio was on the job.</span></p><p><span>“Would you like something to drink?” Rio asked kindly, slipping off her suit jacket and draping it neatly over the kitchen counter.</span></p><p><span>Agatha, sprawled across the couch like she owned the place, watched her every move with shameless interest. “You got anything alcoholic?”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded silently and pulled two beers from the fridge. She carried them over, handed one to Agatha, and sat down on the other end of the sofa, leaving space between the two but still close enough they could feel the warmth coming from the other.</span></p><p><span>“Takeout?” Rio asked after a sip, her tone more statement than question. She already knew Agatha well enough to predict her mood; tonight called for comfort food, not homemade dishes.</span></p><p><span>“Fuck yes. I could fuck some pizza up right now,” Agatha groaned. Her stomach growled loudly on cue. The only real food she’d had all day was the breakfast Rio had made that morning.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t comment, though the corner of her mouth twitched upward. She ordered from her favorite place just down the road.</span></p><p><span>Of course, deciding </span><em><span>what kind</span></em><span> of pizza turned into its own small war. What started as a heated debate escalated quickly, each woman digging her heels in over toppings with the kind of ferocity usually reserved for politics or blood feuds. By the time Jen FaceTimed in the middle of it to let them know they made it back to Agatha’s, she swore the two of them looked like they were one insult away from wrestling on the floor.</span></p><p><span>Finally, they compromised. They ordered </span><em><span>both</span></em><span> pizzas, still grumbling about each other’s “atrocious taste” but secretly pleased with the outcome.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned back, sipping her beer in silence. Agatha smirked into hers, already planning the next little battle she’d pick just to see how far she could push the unshakable bodyguard.</span></p><p><span>The buzzer at the gate rang a short time later, and Rio rose from the couch with the smooth efficiency of someone who never let her guard drop, even at home. She let the driver through after double-checking the cameras and retrieved the pizzas from the delivery kid and shut the door, setting the boxes on the kitchen counter.</span></p><p><span>“Smells like heaven,” Agatha groaned, padding over with her beer in hand. She flipped open the boxes and immediately grinned. “Ah, yes. The superior pizza.” Agatha’s pizza is a black garlic, olive, pepperoncini, and pepperoni pizza with gorgonzola cheese.</span></p><p><span>Rio raised a brow. “You mean the one that looks like a crime scene with all of that?”</span></p><p><span>“Excuse me, hot stuff, but </span><em><span>this</span></em><span>—” Agatha pointed at her loaded slice like it was sacred text—“is art. Yours is just… bread with sadness.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked faintly and slid a slice of her minimalist Spicy chorizo and roasted poblanos onto a plate. “At least mine won’t give me heartburn and regrets.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha took a massive bite, moaning dramatically around the mouthful of cheese. “Mmmm. Worth every regret.”</span></p><p><span>They carried their plates back to the couch, beers within reach, and for a while the apartment was filled only with the sounds of chewing and the occasional muffled groan of appreciation. The city lights glittered beyond the glass walls, but the space between them on the couch felt warmer, cozier.</span></p><p><span>It was Agatha who broke the silence, grabbing the remote like she was claiming a throne. “Alright. Since you cooked breakfast and ordered dinner, I get to pick the show.”</span></p><p><span>Rio arched a brow. “This should be good.”</span></p><p><span>With a sly grin, Agatha queued up </span><em><span>Below Deck</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked. “Really?”</span></p><p><span>“Yes, </span><em><span>really.</span></em><span>” Agatha settled deeper into the couch cushions, smug. “It’s trash, it’s chaotic, and it’s mine.”</span></p><p><span>“You?” Rio said, half-amused, half-incredulous. “The woman who terrifies producers and eats interviewers for breakfast… watches reality TV about yacht crews?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shrugged, unapologetic. “Even witches need guilty pleasures, darling. Now shut up and watch my disaster children argue over laundry.”</span></p><p><span>Rio tried to keep her expression neutral, but the corner of her mouth twitched. “This is worse than pineapple on pizza.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha gasped, clutching her chest. “You take that back.”</span></p><p><span>“Not a chance.”</span></p><p><span>For the next hour, they bantered lightly, Agatha heckling the cast like she was part of the crew, Rio offering dry commentary in between bites of pizza. But eventually, the chatter softened. By the second episode, they’d fallen into a comfortable silence, the glow of the television painting them in shifting colors.</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned back, the edge of her shoulder brushing against Rio’s. She didn’t move away, and neither did Rio.</span></p><p><span>For once, there was no press, no cameras, no stalker. Just two women, pizza boxes, beer bottles, and the soft absurdity of strangers fighting over bunk assignments on a yacht.</span></p><p><span>And Agatha thought, as her eyes drifted to Rio’s profile in the flickering light: if this was what peace looked like, she could get used to it.</span></p><p><br/><br/></p>

<p>The morning sun streamed in through the windows, painting the living room in pale gold. Rio stirred first, her body attuned to early hours no matter how late she’d gone to bed. She shifted slightly, only to realize there was a surprising weight draped over her.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>The actress was tucked firmly against her side, one arm slung over Rio’s stomach, her head resting comfortably on Rio’s shoulder. At some point during the night, they had both slipped down into the cushions, pizza boxes abandoned on the coffee table, Below Deck still paused on the television screen.</p><p>Rio froze, her muscles instinctively going rigid. She could face down gunfire without blinking, but the warmth of Agatha’s breath tickling her collarbone was a different kind of battlefield altogether.</p><p>For one reckless moment, she let herself feel it, the softness of Agatha’s curls brushing against her jaw, the weight of her body pressed close, the quiet peace that settled in her chest. It was… nice. Too nice.</p><p>Agatha shifted in her sleep, nuzzling closer with a contented sigh.</p><p>Rio squeezed her eyes shut. She was never a believer of god, but she shot him a prayer anyway, <em>God help me.</em></p><p>She carefully tried to extract herself, but Agatha’s grip tightened like a vice. Even asleep, she was stubborn.</p><p>“Mm… don’t move,” Agatha mumbled, voice husky with sleep. Her voice went straight to Rio’s core, the raspiness doing something to her. Agatha’s eyes cracked open just enough to catch Rio’s flustered expression. A wicked grin spread across her face. “Well, good morning, darling. I knew you’d give in eventually.”</p><p>Rio scowled, though her ears betrayed her by turning pink. “We fell asleep. Accident. Nothing more.”</p><p>“Of course, of course,” Agatha teased, stretching like a cat but making no effort to remove herself from Rio’s side. “Totally an accident that you let me cuddle you all night.”</p><p>“You clung like a koala. I had no choice.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, the sound warm and unguarded in the quiet apartment. “You’re lucky, I’m adorable.”</p><p>Rio sighed and finally slid out from under her, standing far too quickly too escape the situation. “Breakfast. I’ll make something.”</p><p>Agatha flopped back into the cushions, watching her with an infuriatingly smug smile. “See? Perfect woman. Honestly, it’s not fair.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, but as she moved into the kitchen, she couldn’t quite fight the small smile tugging at her lips.</p><p>For the first time in a long time, the morning felt less like the start of a mission and more like the beginning of something she couldn’t name.</p><p>Agatha trailed after Rio into the kitchen, still heavy with sleep, still raw from the anxiety yesterday had carved into her bones.</p><p>“Can I help cook this time?” she asked, voice softer than usual. She leaned against the counter, watching Rio move with her usual quiet precision. “I feel kinda bad—you’re always cooking for me on top of, you know, saving my life.”</p><p>Rio looked up, and for once, Agatha wasn’t hiding behind a smirk or quip. There was no flirting in her tone, no teasing spark in her eyes, just sincerity. Rio realized she wasn’t just asking to help with breakfast. Agatha was reaching for control, trying to reclaim a piece of herself after everything the stalker had stolen.</p><p>“We’re making huevos con amarillos with café con leche,” Rio said gently. “How do you like your eggs?”</p><p>“Scrambled,” Agatha said immediately, a smile tugging at her lips. “I’ve always hated runny eggs.”</p><p>Rio smiled back, not surprised she’d guessed right. “Figures.”</p><p>They fell into an easy rhythm, Rio handing Agatha ingredients and giving her small directions while she set up the pans. To their quiet surprise, they moved around each other with comfort and ease, domestic in a way that neither of them had expected.</p><p>“You cook a lot of Puerto Rican dishes,” Agatha said, whisking the eggs. “I’m gonna assume you’re Puerto Rican?”</p><p>Rio didn’t look up from slicing plantains. “Yes. My mother was Puerto Rican, my dad was American. We lived in Puerto Rico until I was twelve. After my mom passed, we moved to the States. I still go back to visit.”</p><p>Agatha glanced up at that but didn’t press. She could tell Rio wasn’t looking for pity. So she did what she always did when the air got heavy: she flirted.</p><p>“So-” Agatha smirked, tilting her head. “Does that mean you speak Spanish?”</p><p>Rio’s lips curved. “Sí, entre otros idiomas. ¿Por qué, te prende?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. She didn’t know what Rio had just said, but her body sure as hell reacted. Her mind scrambled for a response, but Rio cut her off casually:</p><p>“The eggs are going to burn.”</p><p>Agatha cursed under her breath, whipping her eyes back to the pan. “You’re evil.”</p><p>Rio only smirked, finishing the plantains and pouring out two mugs of café con leche. They carried everything back to the couch.</p><p>Agatha took one sip of the coffee and nearly moaned. “Oh my god. I think I just ascended. You know you’re going to have to make this for me <em>all the time</em> now, right?”</p><p>Rio just shook her head, smiling fondly.</p><p>Agatha caught herself staring at her then—really staring. For the first time, it felt like Rio had finally set her armor down. She looked calm. Soft. And it made Agatha’s chest ache with something unfamiliar and warm.</p><p>“You’re staring,” Rio said, arching a brow. “Do I have something on my face?” She grabbed a napkin and wiped her mouth.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, smiling softly. Normally, she’d deflect with some filthy quip. But this time, she wanted to sit in the moment. Just the two of them, no walls, no masks.</p><p>Rio studied her a beat longer, trying to read what had shifted, but couldn’t pin it down.</p><p>They ate mostly in silence, trading the occasional jab, but the quiet wasn’t awkward. It was steady. Comfortable.</p><p>Finally, Agatha leaned back, swirling her coffee with a grin. “We should play twenty questions.”</p><p>Rio gave her a wary look. “…That sounds dangerous.”</p><p>“That’s the point, darling,” Agatha smirked. “You keep your walls up so high, I need a crowbar to pry anything out of you. Rules of the game. You gotta answer.”</p><p>“This feels like a trap,” Rio said skeptically</p><p>“Of course, it's a trap, but it's a fun one. And because you keep dodging all my advances, this is the only way I will ever learn anything about you.” Agatha said excited</p><p>Rio just sighs and leans back against the arm of the couch facing Agatha, resigned to her fate. “Fine.”</p><p>Agatha clapped like a kid on Christmas and tucked her feet underneath herself on the couch, eyes sparkling. “First question. Favorite color?”</p><p>“Green,” Rio answered quickly.</p><p>“Mine is purple. Your turn.”</p><p>“Favorite animal?” Rio asked, still keeping things light.</p><p>Agatha’s grin softened into thought. “A rabbit. They’re always portrayed as sweet, timid, and fragile, but in reality, they’re survivors. They’re cunning.”</p><p>Rio blinked, not expecting such a layered answer. She studied Agatha with new appreciation. “That makes sense.”</p><p>“What about you?” Agatha prompted, leaning forward eagerly.</p><p>Rio hesitated, then let the words flow. “That’s harder for me. I’ve always felt tied to different animals at different times. Spiders—because they’re misunderstood, but they build and rebuild with quiet strength. Wolves—protectors of the pack, disciplined, loyal. And snakes… snakes have always spoken to me. Maybe it’s my Puerto Rican roots, maybe it’s how they shed their skin. I feel like I’ve lived a lot of lives myself.”</p><p>Agatha listened intently, hanging on every word. Her lips curved. “You know, those fit you perfectly.”</p><p>Before the silence could deepen, she pivoted with a mischievous grin. “Guilty pleasure?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Trashy action movies. And food? Korean corn dogs.”</p><p>Agatha cocked her head. “What the hell is a Korean corn dog?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes lit up, a rare spark of excitement. “Hot dog dipped in batter, rolled in sugar, covered in fries or Hot Cheetos. I prefer the Cheetos. Had them on a deployment once. I swear I died and came back. I will have to make it for you one day.”</p><p>Agatha found herself smiling, warmth blooming in her chest at the thought of Rio cooking for her again. “So you’re a foodie.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio muttered, smirking. “My turn. What’s something you’re most proud of?”</p><p>Agatha’s posture straightened. “My career. I know that sounds conceited, but it’s true. I fought tooth and nail to be here. Directors, producers, even other actors told me I’d never make it. When my bitch of a mother outed me, I thought it was over. But instead, the country rallied around me. Somehow, against all odds, I made it. And I’m proud of that.”</p><p>Rio’s lips softened into a rare, proud smile, but before she could comment, Agatha fired off: “First celebrity crush. Mine was Angelina Jolie. God, that woman is fine.”</p><p>Rio stiffened. Her face burned. She stayed quiet too long, and Agatha noticed.</p><p>“What? Is it embarrassing? Oh god—was it a man?” she teased.</p><p>Rio muttered something under her breath.</p><p>Agatha leaned forward, smirking. “What was that? Speak up!”</p><p>Rio blurted, face red hot, “It was you!”</p><p>Agatha froze, stunned into silence, then burst into uncontrollable laughter. “Darling… your celebrity crush has been trying to fuck you for weeks, and you keep turning her down!”</p><p>Rio groaned, rubbing her face. “Next question.”</p><p>“Coward,” Agatha teased, but she let it go.</p><p>“First love?” Rio asked quickly, desperate to change the subject.</p><p>Agatha’s laughter died in her throat. The light in her eyes dimmed. She almost deflected, but Rio caught the shift in her body language immediately. She slid closer, resting a hand on Agatha’s knee, steady and grounding.</p><p>“You don’t have to answer,” Rio offered gently. “We can skip it.”</p><p>Agatha drew a slow breath and shook her head. “No. It’s fine.”</p><p>Her voice was quieter, rawer. “I was sixteen. She wasn’t an actress, but she worked around sets. We hit it off instantly. For two years, I thought she was my forever. I was going to propose on our third anniversary.” She swallowed hard. “But I came home early from a job,  and found her in bed with a director. She laughed in my face. Told me she’d never loved me. That she’d used me to climb her way up.”</p><p>Her jaw trembled, but she forced a crooked smile. “After that, I never settled. I just moved from bed to bed. Easier to stay untouchable than risk that kind of humiliation again.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach turned, rage flickering hot and fast. It took every ounce of control not to ask for a name. Instead, she tightened her grip on Agatha’s knee, steady and fierce. <em>No wonder she keeps everyone at arm’s length.</em></p><p>Agatha blinked quickly, brushing away the sting in her eyes. “Your turn.” Agatha tried to joke.</p><p>Rio inhaled deeply. “I was eighteen. Just joined the military. My father had just died, I had nothing left, so I walked into a recruiter’s office with nothing to lose. Years later, I was recruited into Delta Force. That’s where I met her. My rival at first, then my partner. It was Bucky, actually, who pointed out we were bickering because we liked each other.”</p><p>Her voice softened, breaking at the edges. “We fell in love. Quietly, because of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.’ We served side by side in some of the worst places on earth. But we had each other, and that made it bearable. She was… everything.”</p><p>Rio’s throat closed. She forced herself to continue. “On my last mission, the ambush—the one that ended my career—she saw it coming before I did. She threw herself over me when the mortar hit. She took the full force. I was severely injured, but I lived because she gave her life for me.”</p><p>Her voice cracked, tears threatening. “The last thing I saw in her eyes wasn’t fear. It was love. Relief that I was alive. She’s one of the main reasons I built SHIELD.”</p><p>Before Rio could blink the tears away, Agatha reached over, cupping her jaw with gentle fingers. She brushed away the wetness on Rio’s cheek, her own eyes shining.</p><p>For once, there was no smirk, no quip. Just two women, sitting in the quiet aftermath of honesty, their walls stripped bare.</p><p>Agatha whispered, “You deserved better. We both did.”</p><p>Rio covered Agatha’s hand with her own, holding it there against her cheek. And for the first time, neither of them pulled away.</p><p>Rio’s hand lingered over Agatha’s, warm and grounding against her cheek. Their eyes locked, neither woman daring to move, afraid that even breathing too loudly might shatter the fragile intimacy that had bloomed between them.</p><p>For once, Agatha wasn’t smirking. She wasn’t teasing or taunting. She was just looking at Rio with something raw, something unguarded. Rio felt it like a pull in her chest, dragging her closer, closer.</p><p>Agatha’s thumb brushed Rio’s cheekbone, feather-light. “You really are impossible, you know that?” she whispered.</p><p>Rio’s lips parted, a shaky breath slipping free. “So are you.”</p><p>The space between them shrank, hearts pounding in tandem. Agatha tilted forward, Rio following instinctively—</p><p>And then Rio’s phone, lying on the coffee table, began to buzz loudly.</p><p>Both women froze. The sound cut through the moment like a blade. Rio let out a frustrated sigh and grabbed it, her professional reflexes kicking back in. Agatha leaned back against the cushions with a dramatic groan, throwing her hands up to the ceiling.</p><p>“Someone better be dying,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>Rio answered. “What?”</p><p>Jen’s voice came through, tight with urgency. <em>“The shooting’s leaked. It’s all over the press already. Paparazzi, blogs, even mainstream outlets, they’ve got the story that someone fired on Natasha during your photoshoot yesterday. They don’t have all the details yet, but they know it’s connected to Agatha.”</em></p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched. “How bad?”</p><p>“Bad,” Jen confirmed. <em>“#PrayForAgatha is already trending. Some outlets are speculating about a stalker given she's hired you guys recently, others think it was a random attack. Either way, the story’s out. And it’s spreading fast.”</em></p><p>Rio closed her eyes, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Keep me updated. Do <em>not</em> comment to anyone. We’ll handle it.” She hung up, exhaling slowly before turning to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha raised a brow, masking the worry flickering in her eyes with a crooked grin. “Well. So much for our cozy little bubble.”</p><p>Rio glanced at her, still tense, still processing. But she caught the softness in Agatha’s expression, the worry she wasn’t hiding fast enough.</p><p>And suddenly, Rio realized—whatever this pull was with Agatha could wait. Protecting Agatha couldn’t.</p><p>Agatha’s phone lit up like fireworks, buzzing nonstop with notifications. Every outlet, every fan account, every hashtag was blowing up with her name. #PrayForAgatha had gone global.</p><p><b>People Magazine</b>: <strong><em>Agatha Harkness Security gets into a foot chase and a shootout with a mystery person. Is Hollywood’s favorite witch in danger?</em></strong></p><p><em>At approximately 4 p.m. yesterday, L.A time, lead actress in Upcoming Coven of Chaos, Agatha Harkness, new security team intervened when an unknown man tried to tamper with the actress's vehicle, a foot chase followed where the man then proceeded to fire at security giving chase, security returned for and sources say they managed to wound the man before he was able to get away. We reached out to Agatha’s team and Agatha’s security team for a comment and have not heard back. Could this be tied to the reason Agatha recently got a new elite bodyguard team? Coincidence? Random cajacking attempt? Crazed fan? We will keep you updated as we learn more about this developing story.</em></p><p> </p><p><b>BadWitchEnergy</b>: <em>OMG!!! Is Agatha alright?! #PrayforAgatha</em></p><p><b>Slvt4Harkness</b>: <em>Everyone, say thank you to Agatha’s new security team for keeping our mother safe. I hope it was nothing serious. #PrayforAgatha</em></p><p><b>AgathaUpdates</b>: <em>Deep dive: Agatha’s new bodyguards aren’t just hot—they’re lethal. These are terrifying, elite operatives.

Too lazy to research myself.</em></p><p><b>AgathaisMommy</b>: <em>@HexMeAgatha The one in the suit everyone’s thirsting over? That’s Rio Vidal, Co-CEO and founder of S.H.I.E.L.D., ex-Delta Force. Redhead’s Natasha Romanov-Hill, ex-KGB. Blonde is Yelena Belova, also ex-KGB. The tank is Bucky Barnes, former Delta Force, rumored CIA. I don't have enough photos of the other 2 to get histories on them, but I'm going to assume they are just as lethal</em></p><p><b>HarkNessMonster</b>: <em>Damn!! Agatha’s got an army of badasses around her. How did she manage to get the CEO herself to protect her?!</em></p><p>Agatha scrolled through, her lips twisting. “I think I’m gonna have to put out a statement. Jen can spin it as a carjacking gone wrong.”</p><p>Across from her, Rio’s phone was blowing up too, messages from the team at Agatha’s house. The property was swarmed with paparazzi and fans, spilling into the street with flowers, signs, and cameras. Rio looked up at Agatha’s suggestion, jaw tight.</p><p>“If we say carjacking, the stalker will get pissed at not getting the recognition they want and escalate. If we say nothing, the media storm will embolden them further, and they’ll try something louder, more public.” Rio rubbed her temple, the tension in her shoulders sharp enough to cut glass. “It’s a lose-lose. This is why we tried to keep it quiet.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, frustration flickering in her eyes, not just at the situation, but at how quickly Rio had pulled her walls back up. “Yeah, but this way we can at least control the narrative. If people think it was a failed carjacking, it’ll blow over faster.”</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, weighing it. She hated it, but Agatha wasn’t wrong. Finally, she gave a short nod. “Fine. Control the narrative.” She fired off a text to Jen, who was already neck-deep in damage control with lawyers drafting paperwork against the tech who’d leaked. Alice had tracked down the cop who’d tipped the press. Both would be handled.</p><p>Agatha opened Instagram and began typing. She tilted the screen toward Rio when she was finished:</p><p><b>Mother_Harkness: </b> <em>Hey Coven, thank you so much for the outpouring of support. My team and I are completely fine and unharmed. Some guy saw a car and thought it would be a quick steal, not realizing it was mine and protected by a small, feisty Russian. My security acted quickly and professionally and handled the situation. Don’t mess with the S.H.I.E.L.D. crew; they don’t play around. Again, thank you for the love, but I am fine and safe. Love you all.</em></p><p>Rio read it once, then gave a short nod of approval. “Post it.”</p><p>The second Agatha hit publish, her phone exploded with notifications all over again. The Coven was eating it up. Fans were relieved, journalists were quoting her, and memes of “small feisty Russian” were already starting to trend.</p><p>Agatha shut the phone off with a sigh and turned to Rio. Her expression softened, just for her. “Well. There goes our quiet morning.”</p><p>Rio met her gaze, torn between irritation at the mess and something gentler that flickered despite herself.</p><p>And just like the night before, Agatha couldn’t help but think: even if the world was chaos, sitting across from Rio like this felt like the only thing grounding her.</p><p>Agatha curled her legs under her and sipped the last of her café con leche. The sweetness lingered on her tongue, warmth blooming in her chest.</p><p>Her eyes drifted to Rio, always alert, always scanning, even in her own home. Always ready to run straight into the fire.</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into a quiet smile. “You’ll let me kiss you one of these days.”</p><p>Rio looked up sharply, startled. For once, she didn’t have a comeback.</p><p>And Agatha knew then: she was right.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>For the next hour, both women were glued to their phones, Agatha fielding calls from Jen and Lilia, Rio coordinating with her team, Alice, and legal contacts. It wasn’t until Agatha shifted on the couch and caught a whiff of herself that she realized she hadn’t showered since yesterday morning.</p><p>She groaned and set her phone down. “Okay, I cannot make it through another hour like this. Can you point me to a shower and maybe a change of clothes? I’m assuming I’m stuck here another night, given the circus camped outside my house.”</p><p>Rio looked up, guilt flashing across her face. “God, I’m sorry. I don’t ever have people over, so I forget how to be a host.” She stood, running a hand through her hair. “The guest room is upstairs, first door on the right. It has its own bathroom. Use whatever’s there, and I’ll grab you some clothes that’ll fit.”</p><p>Agatha pushed to her feet, amused by how flustered Rio looked. “You, forgetting to plan something? Alert the press.” She winked, earning herself an eye roll.</p><p>She followed Rio’s directions upstairs. The guest bedroom was bigger than she expected, minimalist, but distinctly Rio. A queen bed sat neatly in the center, made with earthy green comforters and crisp sheets. The room was tidy to the point of discipline, but Agatha caught subtle touches that screamed Rio: a neatly stacked pile of paperbacks on the nightstand, a folded throw that smelled faintly of vanilla and cedar.</p><p>She peeked into the walk-in closet, mostly empty, though a few boxes stacked neatly on the shelves told her Rio used it for storage.</p><p>To the right of the bed, a door led into the bathroom, and Agatha stopped short. It was just as sleek and modern as the rest of the apartment. A gleaming jacuzzi tub dominated one corner, and across from it, a walk-in shower wide enough to fit three people comfortably.</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together, heat creeping up her neck as her mind <em>immediately</em> went there. “Nope,” she muttered to herself, shaking her head. “Not allowed. Not thinking about sharing showers. Absolutely not.”</p><p>Agatha had just shimmied out of her jeans when the door swung open.</p><p>“These are the only clothes I could find that might fit you and are more your style,” Rio said as she stepped in, holding a neatly folded pile in her hands. She hadn’t looked up yet—too focused on explaining herself—until she finally did.</p><p>Her gaze landed squarely on Agatha’s bare chest.</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>For ten solid seconds, she didn’t move, didn’t blink—just stood there, eyes wide, staring at her tits like her brain had short-circuited.</p><p>Agatha, completely unbothered, let out a sharp laugh. “Oh, darling. About time.”</p><p>The sound jolted Rio like a slap. She tore her gaze upward, cheeks blazing. “Oh my god—I’m so sorry, I should have knocked! You have—” She clamped her mouth shut, too late. The words had already escaped. “Nice tits.”</p><p>Agatha doubled over laughing, her voice ringing off the tile.</p><p>Rio looked horrified, stumbling over her own tongue. “Wait! I didn’t mean—that is—I mean, I <em>do</em> mean it, you do, but I didn’t mean to say it out loud, or look, or—oh my god, I’m sorry, I’m gay!”</p><p>She panicked, shoved the clothes into Agatha’s arms, and spun toward the door. Except she spun too fast and slammed directly into it with a solid <em>thunk</em>.</p><p>“Son of a—” she hissed, then, to the door, “Sorry!”</p><p>Trying to recover, Rio yanked the handle, bolted out, and immediately tripped over her own feet. She smacked her hip against the dresser, stubbed her toe, and launched into a string of curses in at least four different languages as she limped down the hall, mortified.</p><p>Agatha collapsed against the bathroom counter, laughing so hard her stomach cramped. Tears pricked at her eyes as she gasped for air, the image of Rio’s wide-eyed panic and muttered apology to a <em>door</em> burned into her memory forever.</p><p>Even as she stepped into the steaming shower, Agatha kept chuckling to herself. For once, she hadn’t even been trying to fluster her stoic bodyguard, yet somehow, she’d managed to unravel Rio Vidal completely.</p><p>And oh, she was never going to let her live it down.</p><p>Rio stormed down the stairs like a woman fleeing a battlefield, muttering curses under her breath. Her toe throbbed, her pride was in shambles, and she was fairly certain she had just apologized to a <em>door</em>.</p><p>She needed an outlet.</p><p>Without thinking, she headed straight for the small home gym tucked off the main living space. Within seconds, she was in her sports bra and slacks, slamming fists into the heavy bag like it had personally ruined her life.</p><p><em>Stupid. Stupid. You looked right at her. You said she had—</em> she punched harder <em>—nice tits. Out loud. To her face. While she was naked. In her bathroom. While you were supposed to be professional.</em></p><p>Another brutal punch. The chain rattled above her.</p><p>“Dios mío,” she groaned, forehead pressing against the cool leather of the bag. Her muscles were already burning, but it wasn’t enough to shake the image seared into her mind: Agatha’s easy confidence, the curve of her smirk, the way she’d laughed like she’d been <em>waiting</em> for Rio to snap all along.</p><p>Rio clenched her fists tighter. Working out wasn’t helping. If anything, every drop of sweat just reminded her of how much Agatha got under her skin.</p><p>Meanwhile, Agatha stood under the spray of the shower, hot water cascading down her shoulders. She closed her eyes and let herself breathe for the first time all day.</p><p>It should have been a moment of quiet, but her mind spun with thoughts of Rio.</p><p>Not just how Rio had looked, flushed and flustered, tripping over herself in the most endearingly uncharacteristic way, but what it meant. Ever since the two met, Agatha had been pushing, teasing, throwing every innuendo she had at Rio. And finally, finally, she’d cracked.</p><p>But it wasn’t just that.</p><p>Agatha pressed her palms to the tile, chest tightening. She’d watched Rio carry her burdens like armor, putting everyone else before herself. And yet when Rio had shared about her first love, the grief still raw in her voice, Agatha had felt something stir inside her that went deeper than desire.</p><p>Something dangerous. Something she hadn’t let herself feel in years.</p><p>She exhaled shakily. “You’re in trouble, Harkness.”</p><p>Freshly showered, Agatha rifled through the clothes Rio had left. A pair of black joggers hung low on her hips, just a touch too big, and she paired them with one of Rio’s button-ups, rolling the sleeves to her elbows. The fabric smelled faintly of cedar and vanilla—<em>her</em>.</p><p>Agatha smirked at her reflection. “Perfect.”</p><p>When she came downstairs, she followed the rhythmic sound of fists hitting leather. She leaned against the doorway of the gym, arms folded, watching Rio punish the heavy bag like it had personally offended her.</p><p>“Well, well,” Agatha purred. “Is this how you cope after seeing me naked? Beating the poor punching bag half to death?”</p><p>Rio’s fists stilled instantly. She turned, breathless, strands of hair sticking to her damp forehead. And then she saw Agatha, lounging casually in her clothes, the shirt hanging loose in all the wrong ways, collarbones peeking out, lips curled in a teasing grin.</p><p>Rio’s brain short-circuited all over again.</p><p>“Why,” Rio asked flatly, “are you wearing my clothes?” </p><p>Agatha pushed off the doorframe and sauntered closer. “Because, darling, you gave them to me. And because”—she tugged lightly at the hem of the shirt, smirking, “they smell like you. Vanilla and something earthy. Very comforting.”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, muscles tense from more than just her workout. “You’re impossible.”</p><p>“And you,” Agatha countered, stepping into her space, eyes dancing, “are very, <em>very</em> easy to fluster. Which, I have to admit, I enjoy more than I probably should.”</p><p>Rio forced herself to look away, grabbing her water bottle like it was a lifeline. “You should eat something. You’ve had a long day.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, circling her like a cat that had finally cornered its prey. “Always so professional. Always so serious.” She leaned in close enough that Rio could feel her breath on her neck. “But I know what I saw. And I know what you said.”</p><p>Rio shut her eyes, pulse hammering. “Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha pulled back with a victorious grin, her laugh low and husky. “Don’t worry, darling. Your secret’s safe with me.”</p><p>She winked, turning on her heel and heading for the kitchen, leaving Rio rooted in place, fists still clenched, heart pounding like she’d just run into gunfire.</p><p>And Agatha, for all her teasing, couldn’t stop smiling. She finally had proof that beneath all that armor, Rio Vidal was just as undone by her as she was by Rio.</p><p>Dinner was quiet, the kind of quiet that felt earned after the week they’d had. Neither of them wanted to cook, so Rio had tossed a Stouffer’s mac and cheese into the oven. They ate it straight from mismatched bowls, sitting shoulder to shoulder on the couch with Below Deck flickering on the screen.</p><p>Rio would never admit it, not even under interrogation, but she’d started to enjoy the chaos of the yacht crew almost as much as Agatha did. Agatha knew though with every time Rio smirked at a sarcastic comment or muttered “idiots” under her breath, it gave her away.</p><p>They didn’t talk about what happened earlier. Rio avoided it, and Agatha, smug as a cat, let her. The knowing smirks, the little chuckles under her breath—it was enough of a reminder.</p><p>Halfway through the episode, Rio finally broke the silence. “Tomorrow I’ll take you back to your house. But I’ll need to return to S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters for a few hours—paperwork, signatures, some diplomatic nonsense with another client. Bucky will take point until I’m back.”</p><p>Agatha hummed in acknowledgment, chewing slowly. She wouldn’t admit it, but she would miss Rio’s constant presence. Still, a few hours with the rest of her bodyguards could be… entertaining.</p><p>“Jen said they’re releasing the digital copy of the photoshoot tomorrow,” Agatha said suddenly. “They were going to wait until next week, but she thinks it’ll help take attention off the stalker.”</p><p>Rio stiffened almost imperceptibly. She hadn’t seen the pictures yet, and the thought of herself splashed across the internet beside Agatha made her stomach twist. She wasn’t a model. What if she looked awkward? What if she dragged Agatha’s image down? The fans adored Agatha—she didn’t want to be the weak link in her orbit.</p><p>Agatha caught it instantly. She slid her hand onto Rio’s knee, warm and grounding. “Hey. They’ll love it. I know my fans—they’ll be drooling. Hell, half of them are already thirsting over you, and that’s just from blurry paparazzi shots.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, unconvinced.</p><p>“I mean it,” Agatha pressed, voice softer. “You’re gorgeous. And people already love you. You’ve got nothing to worry about.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze lifted, locking onto Agatha’s. Something unspoken passed between them. Then, softly, reverently, Rio whispered:</p><p><em>“Eres la mujer más hermosa del mundo.”</em></p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. She didn’t know exactly what Rio had said, but the way she said it, like it was sacred, like it hurt to even say aloud told her everything.</p><p>Before Agatha could ask, Rio pushed back from the couch. “I need a shower. It’s late. Good night, Agatha.” Her voice was gentle, but final. She cast one last lingering glance over her shoulder before disappearing up the stairs, her door shutting with a quiet click.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, her chest tight, and gathered their empty plates. She rinsed them in the sink, washed and dried them, partly to be polite, partly to keep herself busy.</p><p>Then, with the dishes done, curiosity got the better of her.</p><p>She wandered the hall, her fingers trailing over the picture frames lining the walls. A young Rio smiled back at her in one photo, nestled between two adults who must have been her parents. The gap between her teeth made Agatha’s lips curl, adorable, she thought, against all her better instincts.</p><p>In another, Rio as a teenager stood proudly with her father at her high school graduation. Her father’s expression was pure, unfiltered pride.</p><p>But it was the next picture that stopped Agatha cold.</p><p>Rio in full Delta fatigues, rifle slung across her body. Her old team crowded around her, some goofing off, others solemn. But Agatha’s eyes found only one person: a tall brunette with dimples, smiling like she’d just won the world. Her eyes were locked on Rio—<em>only</em> on Rio—with such raw devotion it made Agatha’s chest ache.</p><p>The woman Rio had spoken about. The one who had died to save her.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers hovered just above the glass. She could almost feel the warmth of the woman’s joy radiating through the photo. A pang of something sharp and jealous twisted low in her gut, followed quickly by guilt. That woman had given everything for Rio. Agatha had no right to feel envious of a ghost.</p><p>Still, she couldn’t look away. Not from the way Rio had smiled in that photo, not from the way love seemed to shine between them so clearly it could burn.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard and stepped back, forcing herself down the hall. She didn’t know what unsettled her more, the photo, or the realization that for the first time in years, she wanted to be the one someone looked at that way.</p><p>And God help her, she wanted that someone to be Rio Vidal.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha woke to the smell of coffee and the faint hum of movement downstairs. For one hazy second, she thought she was at home—until she rolled over and saw the earthy green comforter of Rio’s guest bed.</p><p>Her lips curved. Right. <em>Rio’s clothes. Rio’s shower. Rio’s very memorable meltdown.</em></p><p>She stretched, tugged on the joggers and shirt Rio had given her, and padded downstairs.</p><p>Rio was already dressed in a crisp suit, hair pulled back, moving around the kitchen with military precision. Her face was composed, unreadable—the armor back in place.</p><p>“Morning,” Agatha said brightly, leaning against the counter. “No dramatic apologies to inanimate objects today?”</p><p>Rio froze mid-pour of the coffee and shot her a look. “You’re never going to let that go, are you?”</p><p>“Not in this lifetime,” Agatha smirked, taking the mug Rio slid across to her. “But don’t worry. It was adorable.”</p><p>Rio muttered something in Spanish that Agatha pretended not to hear, sipping her coffee with a satisfied little smile. The silence that followed was comfortable, though Agatha couldn’t stop glancing at her—at the set jaw, at the subtle shadows under her eyes. She thought about the photo in the hallway, about the way Rio had once been looked at with so much love.</p><p>For the first time in a long time, Agatha wanted to be seen the same way.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, jolting her back. “Eat something before we go. It’ll be a long day.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, masking the pang in her chest. “Bossy. I like it.”</p><p>By late morning, Rio pulled the SUV up the discreet back entrance of Agatha’s property. The front was swarmed with paparazzi and fans, cameras flashing like a wall of lightning, but Bucky and Alice had cleared a quiet way in.</p><p>“Stay close,” Rio murmured, one hand hovering near her weapon as she opened Agatha’s door.</p><p>Inside, Clint was stationed at the gate monitors while Natasha scanned the perimeter. Yelena leaned against the kitchen island, flipping a knife idly between her fingers.</p><p>“Clear,” Bucky reported, shutting the door behind them.</p><p>Rio guided Agatha toward the living room. “Status.”</p><p>Alice straightened, tablet in hand. “We’ve traced the leak to the tech who broke his NDA. Legal’s on it. Press speculation is still running with the ‘carjacking’ cover story. Nothing stronger has surfaced—yet.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio said, though her tone was clipped. “Keep the team tight today. No one leaves their post. Agatha’s not to step outside without clearance.”</p><p>Agatha bristled a little at the phrasing—like she was a mission instead of a person, but she held her tongue.</p><p>Natasha glanced up. “You still heading to HQ?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Paperwork. Shouldn’t be more than a few hours. Bucky will take point.” She turned to Agatha, her gaze steady but softer now. “You’ll be safe.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her chin, feigning nonchalance. “Safe, yes. Bored, probably.”</p><p>Yelena snorted. “Don’t worry, I’ll keep you entertained.”</p><p>“God help me,” Rio muttered under her breath, which made Agatha laugh outright.</p><p>But when their eyes met again, something unspoken lingered there. Agatha knew it wasn’t just about safety, or paperwork, or even the stalker.</p><p>For all of Rio’s armor, leaving her, even for a few hours wasn’t easy.</p><p>And for Agatha, watching her go felt far heavier than it should have.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jen and Lilia arrived not long after, the older woman’s expression softening with maternal concern the second she laid eyes on Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened at the sight. She could still remember the very first time they met—an afterparty when she was only fourteen, cornered by a drunk executive whose comments had turned lewd and invasive. She had frozen, too scared to move. Then Lilia appeared like a storm, sweeping Agatha away and staying glued to her side the rest of the night. By morning, Lilia had drawn up legal documents that severed Agatha’s mother as her agent, replacing her herself.</p><p>Agatha had never asked what strings Lilia pulled, what threats or bargains she made, but she’d been grateful every day since. In the years that followed, Lilia had been more mother to her than her own blood ever was.</p><p>“How are you holding up, dear?” Lilia asked gently, her hand brushing Agatha’s arm.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha said honestly, though a small smile tugged at her lips. “Rio helped a lot last night to take my mind off everything.”</p><p>“I bet she did,” Yelena quipped from across the room, smirking like a cat.</p><p>Agatha didn’t miss a beat—she grabbed the nearest throw pillow and launched it at her. Yelena caught it one-handed without even glancing up, laughing smugly.</p><p>Lilia chuckled too, shaking her head with the fond exasperation of someone who had long accepted Agatha’s brand of chaos.</p><p>Jen, scrolling rapidly on her phone, suddenly lit up. “The photoshoot just went live. It’s already blowing up—#Agathario is trending, and you two are being shipped like crazy. Fans are thirsting over both of you, losing their collective minds.”</p><p>Bucky blinked, looking between them. “What pictures? Why are people shipping you two?”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk turned downright wicked. “Oh, right. You guys missed that part. The model they booked for me called out last minute. No time to find a replacement. So I convinced Rio to step in.”</p><p>Yelena practically cackled. “No way. No <em>way</em>. Show me.”</p><p>She whipped out her phone and pulled up the shots. Within seconds, Natasha and Bucky were peering over her shoulder. Their reactions were immediate and unanimous—their eyebrows shot up like rockets.</p><p>Even through the screen, the chemistry was unmistakable. The tension in the photos wasn’t posed; it was <em>real</em>. The way Rio and Agatha leaned into each other, eyes locked, hovering on the edge of fight or kiss—it radiated heat.</p><p>Natasha let out a long, low whistle. “Damn. These photos are hot. And it looks like your fans agree.”</p><p><b>@WitchyCoven:</b> THE PHOTOSHOOT JUST DROPPED. AGATHA AND HER BODYGUARD.

She had pulled up the photoshoot on her laptop, scrolling through the flood of fan reactions while cackling.</p><p>“This is exactly what we needed,” Jen added with a satisfied grin. “The attention is off the stalker, and the buzz for your next film just shot through the roof. Press is calling this one of the best promo shoots of your career.”</p><p>The group kept scrolling, trading comments back and forth, laughing at the unhinged thirst of Agatha’s coven. The memes were already spiraling out of control. Agatha joined in with the laughter, but her mind kept drifting. She couldn’t help but wonder what Rio was doing right now, probably being bombarded with the same notifications, maybe even being mercilessly teased by Maria. The thought made her smirk.</p><p>After a while, the noise of it all grew heavy. Agatha excused herself and slipped upstairs to change. If she was stuck here, she might as well take advantage of the pool and the California sun.</p><p>She chose a purple bikini that hugged her curves, tossed her sunglasses on top of her head, and carried a towel outside. The air was warm, the sky a cloudless blue. She set her towel down on the pool chair before sliding into the water with a smooth grace.</p><p>The cool embrace of the pool melted away her tension instantly. Agatha tilted her face to the sun and let herself drift onto her back, floating lazily, the world beyond the water’s surface muffled and distant.</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she could see Bucky posted by the back door, eyes sharp, ever-watchful. Natasha was pacing the fence line further off, scanning for paparazzi or overeager fans trying to sneak a peek. Yelena’s voice carried faintly now and then, checking in over comms as she patrolled the outer perimeter. Alice had claimed the front gate, her posture deceptively casual, but her focus razor-sharp. Clint, on his well-earned break, is fast asleep.</p><p>Protected on all sides, Agatha felt safe enough to close her eyes.</p><p>And her thoughts, like they always seemed to slid right back to Rio.</p><p>The way she moved with that soldier’s discipline yet somehow softened around the edges when she thought no one was looking. The accidental slips, the blushes, the way her walls had cracked in little flashes, confessions shared over coffee, laughter that slipped past her guard, panic when caught staring.</p><p>Agatha floated, the water rocking her gently, and smiled to herself. For years, she’d kept her heart locked down, throwing herself into flings and distractions to avoid the ache of real connection. But Rio… Rio made her want to test those locks again.</p><p>Dangerous. Terrifying.</p><p>And maybe exactly what she needed.</p><p>Agatha floated lazily on her back, sunglasses shielding her eyes, though she kept sneaking glances toward the back door where Bucky stood on duty. He looked impossibly still, arms folded, gaze scanning the yard like a hawk.</p><p>Finally, she broke the silence. “You know, for someone with the nickname <em>Winter Soldier,</em> you’d think you’d be more chatty in the sun.”</p><p>Bucky’s lip twitched, the closest thing to a smile she’d seen from him since breakfast. “I’m paid to watch, not talk.”</p><p>“Mm. But you’ve known Rio a long time, haven’t you?” Agatha asked casually, drifting toward the pool’s edge. She propped her elbows on the side and tilted her head at him. “Teammates. Friends. Whatever Delta Force bonding looks like.”</p><p>Bucky didn’t move, but his blue eyes flicked toward her. “Yeah. Long enough.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, sensing the opening. “Then tell me, what’s her deal? She doesn’t talk about herself much. Unless it’s work or how she’s going to drag me over her shoulder if I don’t listen.”</p><p>That almost earned her a laugh. Almost.</p><p>“Rio’s… steady,” Bucky said slowly. “She’s had to be. She doesn’t let people in easily. When she does, it’s because they’ve proven they won’t quit on her.”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk softened. “And who did she let in?” But she already knows the answer, she is just trying to find out as much as she can.</p><p>This time, the silence stretched long. Agatha thought he might refuse, but finally, Bucky shifted, jaw tightening. “Valkyrie. Same team as us. Hell of a soldier. They were inseparable.”</p><p>Agatha stayed quiet, letting him speak.</p><p>“She was the first person Rio ever looked at like the rest of the world didn’t exist. And Rio was the same for her.” Bucky’s gaze was fixed far away now, lost in memory. “When the ambush happened… Val didn’t hesitate. Saved Rio’s life by ending her own. That kind of thing—changes you.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. She thought of the photo she’d seen in the hallway—the brunette’s radiant smile, the way her eyes had been locked only on Rio. “She loved her,” Agatha murmured, more to herself than to Bucky.</p><p>“Yeah,” Bucky said softly. “And Rio loved her. Still does, in some ways. She doesn’t talk about it much, but you can see it if you know what to look for.” He turned his head, studying Agatha now. “Why are you asking?”</p><p>Agatha pushed her sunglasses up, meeting his gaze head-on. “Because… I want to understand her. And maybe—” she paused, biting back the vulnerability that threatened to spill out. “Maybe I want to know if she’s capable of letting someone in again.”</p><p>Bucky’s expression didn’t change, but his tone was gentler when he finally answered. “She is. But she won’t make it easy. And if you’re playing games with her, Agatha… don’t. She deserves better than that.”</p><p>Agatha let out a short laugh, though it lacked its usual sharpness. “You think I don’t know that?”</p><p>Bucky gave her a long, unreadable look, then turned back toward the fence line, scanning the horizon once more. “Then prove it.”</p><p>Agatha sank lower into the water, her smirk fading into something quieter, more contemplative. For once, she didn’t have a comeback.</p><p>Agatha nearly collided with Rio the moment she stepped back inside, towel still slung low around her hips, droplets of pool water trailing down her skin. Rio’s hands shot out instinctively, steadying her—one on each hip.</p><p>“We really have to stop meeting like this,” Agatha smirked, delighting in the contact.</p><p>Rio realized where her hands were and stepped back so fast she nearly tripped over her own boots. She cleared her throat, trying for professionalism, though the faint pink in her cheeks betrayed her. “How has today been?”</p><p>“Relaxing.” Agatha’s grin widened. “Did you see the fan reactions to our photoshoot?”</p><p>Rio’s ears turned scarlet. She rocked on her heels, gaze fixed firmly anywhere but Agatha’s face.</p><p>“I’ll take that as a yes,” Agatha laughed, brushing past her.</p><p>“Your fans are… very impassioned,” Rio admitted at last, though the corner of her mouth betrayed a reluctant smile.</p><p>Agatha leaned in as she passed, her arms grazing lightly down Rio’s as if it were the most natural thing in the world. “Darling, that’s the polite way of saying they’d sell their souls to see you bend me over a chair.”</p><p>Rio nearly choked on air. Agatha just chuckled, sauntering toward the stairs.</p><p>“I was thinking,” she said, pausing at the bottom step and glancing back over her shoulder. “Tonight, everyone should compete in a bowling championship. I’ve got a bowling alley that doesn’t get enough love. Team bonding, you know? If my life is in your hands, I should know you all better.”</p><p>Rio’s brows arched. “You realize that could end in physical brawls? This group doesn’t exactly… handle losing well.”</p><p>Agatha’s grin turned wicked. “Well, now it’s a <em>must.</em> Gather everyone in the alley. You’ve got alarms set, and with all of you in one room, I’ll be safe. So don’t start worrying.”</p><p>She ascended the stairs, hips swaying just enough to make Rio’s jaw tighten.</p><p>Rio stood there for a long moment, pinching the bridge of her nose and muttering something in Spanish that sounded a lot like a prayer.</p><p>Tonight was going to be chaos.</p><p>And somehow, she knew Agatha wouldn’t have it any other way.</p><p>The private bowling alley gleamed under dimmed lights, neon strips glowing down each lane. Agatha was already perched on one of the couches, purple lounge set hugging her frame, a glass of wine in hand. She looked far too entertained for someone who claimed this was “team bonding.” She and Jen have decided to sit out the competition, saying they just want to drink and enjoy the scenery.</p><p>“All right,” Rio said, clapping her hands once with a soldier’s command presence. “We’ll split into teams. Winner gets bragging rights. Loser—” her eyes swept over Yelena, who was already twirling a ball like she meant to weaponize it—“does dishes duty for a week.”</p><p>“That’s cruel and unusual punishment,” Clint muttered, tying his shoes.</p><p>“Don’t lose, then,” Natasha shot back.</p><p>Bucky smirked, already chalking his hands like he was prepping for a mission. “Oh, I don’t lose.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw ticked. “We’ll see about that.”</p><p>Agatha raised her glass in salute. “God, this is better than TV already.”</p><h3><b>Teams</b></h3><ul>
<li><b>Team 1:</b> Rio, Natasha, Clint<br/><br/></li>
<li><b>Team 2:</b> Bucky, Yelena, Alice<br/><br/></li>
</ul><p>Yelena fist-pumped. “We’ve got this in the bag. Barnes, you better not bowl like an old man.”</p><p>“Kid, I was putting bullets through moving targets before you were out of diapers,” Bucky deadpanned.</p><p>“That’s not the same thing!” Yelena laughed, nearly dropping her ball.</p><p>Alice, bouncing on her toes, grinned. “I don’t even care if we lose. This is <em>amazing.</em>”</p><p>Clint took the first shot for Team 1, lining up with exaggerated precision. “Watch and learn, rookies.”</p><p>He released. The ball curved beautifully… then missed every pin except one.</p><p>Natasha groaned, massaging her temple. “You’re pathetic.”</p><p>“Pathetic? That was a <em>warm-up shot,</em>” Clint protested.</p><p>“Uh-huh.” Nat stepped up next, her form clean and sharp, sending the ball down for a flawless strike. She turned back with smug ease. “That’s how it’s done.”</p><p>“Show-off,” Clint muttered.</p><p>On the other lane, Yelena skipped up with no real strategy, flung the ball, and laughed hysterically when it ricocheted into the gutter. “Oops.”</p><p>Alice clapped like she’d just witnessed a miracle. “That was still really fun to watch!”</p><p>Bucky stepped forward, muscles taut, eyes narrowed like he was lining up a sniper shot. The ball thundered down the lane, pins exploding everywhere—strike. He didn’t smile, just nodded once, as if to say <em>of course.</em></p><p>Rio’s competitive streak lit up like a fuse. She grabbed her ball, rolled her shoulders, and matched Bucky’s strike with one of her own. When she turned back, their eyes locked.</p><p>“Not bad,” Bucky drawled.</p><p>“You’ll be eating those words by the end,” Rio shot back.</p><p>Agatha leaned toward Jen, who had joined her with popcorn. “If those two don’t arm wrestle by midnight, I’ll eat my towel.”</p><p>As the game went on, Natasha and Clint devolved into bickering like siblings at Thanksgiving.</p><p>“You’re <em>stepping into my line of sight,</em>” Clint accused.</p><p>“You don’t need a line of sight to throw a ball,” Natasha retorted. “Just stop sucking.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Yelena had discovered that spinning in a circle before releasing the ball was “more fun,” even if it never hit more than three pins. Alice cheered for her like she’d just won gold at the Olympics.</p><p>Rio and Bucky traded strike for strike, tension mounting each round. Both were silent, deadly serious, as if the fate of the world depended on who hit more pins.</p><p>Agatha, sipping wine like a queen watching her court, couldn’t resist needling them. “You know, you could just admit you’re in love and get it over with.”</p><p>Both Rio and Bucky froze mid-motion, turned slowly toward her, and said in unison: “No.”</p><p>Agatha cackled, nearly spilling her drink.</p><p>It all came down to the last frame. Tied score. Team 1 with Rio up, Team 2 with Bucky.</p><p>The room went silent.</p><p>Rio inhaled, exhaled, and sent the ball rocketing down the lane. Strike. Clean, perfect, merciless.</p><p>Bucky smirked. “Cute.” He stepped up, rolled his own… and struck as well.</p><p>The scoreboard flashed: <b>Tie.</b></p><p>Everyone groaned.</p><p>“That’s not fair,” Yelena whined. “We can’t both do dishes!”</p><p>Agatha stood, clapping her hands together. “Oh, I think this calls for a tiebreaker.” She gestured grandly toward the empty lanes. “Single frame. Rio versus Bucky. Sudden death.”</p><p>The two soldiers squared off, fire in their eyes.</p><p>Natasha sighed, crossing her arms. “If this ends with broken furniture, I’m not explaining it to Maria.”</p><p>Agatha leaned back, savoring every second. “Oh, darling. I wouldn’t dream of stopping them.”</p><p>The air in the bowling alley thickened with anticipation. Rio and Bucky squared off, each holding a ball like it was a weapon.</p><p>Agatha perched on the back of the couch, wine glass in hand, a smirk plastered across her face. Jen sat beside her, popcorn bowl in her lap, whispering commentary like a sports announcer.</p><p>“Ladies, gentlemen, and lesbians of all ages,” Jen said dramatically, “we are about to witness the ultimate showdown: The Brooding Bodyguard Bowl-Off.”</p><p>Agatha raised her glass. “Place your bets, people. I’ve got fifty on Rio.”</p><p>“Traitor,” Clint muttered, but he didn’t bet against her.</p><p>Alice crossed her arms, smirking. “I’ll take Barnes. He has the longer reach.”</p><p>“Excuse you,” Agatha drawled, eyes still on Rio. “Rio has discipline. Precision. She’s hotter. It’s not even a competition.”</p><p>Rio flushed, shoulders tensing, while Bucky coughed into his fist to hide a laugh.</p><p>Rio stepped up first, lining her shot with calm focus. Just as she pulled back, Yelena shouted from behind her: “Don’t choke, boss lady!”</p><p>The ball veered slightly right but still managed to take down eight pins. Rio exhaled sharply, muttering in Spanish, and shot Yelena a glare that would have sent lesser mortals fleeing.</p><p>Yelena only grinned. “What? Encouragement!”</p><p>“Sabotage,” Natasha corrected, though she didn’t sound sorry.</p><p>Bucky swaggered up next. Just as he bent to release, Clint shouted, “Bucky! You bowl like a geriatric grandpa!!”</p><p>The ball ricocheted off the bumper and hit only four pins.</p><p>Bucky turned slowly, death in his eyes. “You’re dead, Barton.”</p><p>“Worth it,” Clint wheezed, doubled over in laughter.</p><p>“Barnes, honey, try aiming this time,” Agatha called sweetly. “And Rio—oh darling, that little frown line you get when you’re mad? Devastating. Keep it up.”</p><p>Jen leaned toward her. “You’re the devil.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said smugly.</p><p>Rio tried to block out the noise, jaw set. She rolled her second ball—strike. Clean, perfect.</p><p>“YES!” Agatha cheered, nearly spilling her wine. “That’s my girl!”</p><p>Rio’s ears turned pink.</p><p>Bucky growled, lined up his own, and threw with so much force the ball cracked against the pins like a gunshot. Strike.</p><p>Both tied again. It all came down to this.</p><p>Rio inhaled deeply, the room falling into hushed silence. She stepped forward, smooth and steady, and released. The ball thundered down the lane, pins exploding in another strike.</p><p>Bucky rolled his shoulders, smirking. “Not bad.” He hefted his ball, ready to match her.</p><p>Agatha cupped her hands around her mouth. “Hey, Bucky!”</p><p>He glanced back instinctively. “What?”</p><p>Agatha grinned wickedly. “Rio bowls hotter than you.”</p><p>Bucky snorted, rolled his eyes, and let the ball fly—only to watch it drift just an inch too far left. Nine pins fell. One wobbled… then stayed standing.</p><p>The alley erupted.</p><p>“AND THE WINNER IS—RIO VIDAL!” Jen bellowed like a ring announcer.</p><p>Yelena booed dramatically, stomping her feet. Natasha chuckled, patting Bucky’s shoulder. Alice clapped like she’d just witnessed history. Clint was doubled over in tears.</p><p>Agatha leapt from the couch, wine glass raised like a trophy. “Victory is ours!” she declared, grabbing Rio’s arm and holding it aloft like a champion prizefighter.</p><p>Rio shook her head, muttering under her breath, but she couldn’t hide the smile tugging at her lips.</p><p>Bucky growled halfheartedly. “Rematch. Tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha winked. “Anytime, darling. But for now… the dishes are all yours.”</p><p>Bucky groaned, and the team dissolved into laughter.</p><p>The bowling alley was still buzzing with leftover laughter as the team drifted out in pairs, their voices echoing faintly down the hall. Bucky and Clint were arguing about rematch conditions. Natasha and Yelena were bickering over who cheated more. Alice trailed after them, humming happily, still replaying the chaos. Jen follows her, trying to strike up a conversation. </p><p>Agatha lingered behind, half-empty glass of wine in her hand, watching Rio methodically shut down the scoring console and switch off the neon strips over the lanes.</p><p>“You always clean up after everyone else,” Agatha said softly.</p><p>Rio glanced over her shoulder, a faint smile tugging at her lips. “Occupational hazard.”</p><p>Agatha set her glass aside and crossed the space between them, barefoot on the glossy wood. “No, it’s more than that. You carry everything, don’t you? Every room you walk into, you take responsibility for it.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer. Her jaw flexed, her eyes dropping to the floor as if she could deflect the weight of Agatha’s words.</p><p>Agatha reached out, lightly touching her arm. “Rio, look at me.”</p><p>Slowly, reluctantly, Rio did. And Agatha let her mask slip. No smirk, no coy flirtation, no teasing lilt. Just raw truth.</p><p>“I know I flirt too much. I know I come off like I don’t take anything seriously. But I do. Especially this. Especially you.” Her voice wavered but didn’t break. “I don’t want just another fling. Not with you. I don’t want a distraction, or a one-night stand, or something I can laugh off in the morning. I want <em>you.</em> Really you. Mess and scars and all. And that scares the hell out of me.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught. For a moment, her carefully constructed walls trembled. She searched Agatha’s face, as if trying to find the joke, the trap, the performance. But there was nothing but honesty staring back at her.</p><p>Agatha’s hand slid down Rio’s arm until their fingers brushed. “So why are you holding back?” she whispered. “Because I can <em>feel</em> it, Rio. You want this too. So why?”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, exhaling like she’d been carrying the weight for years. “Because I can’t…” Her voice cracked. “I can’t watch someone I care about die again. Not after Valkyrie. Not after watching her while she bled out because I couldn’t protect her. She was my first love, Agatha, and she died saving me. I live every day with that guilt. And I don’t know if I could survive losing someone else I—” She cut herself off, shaking her head. “Not you. Not like that.”</p><p>The words hit Agatha square in the chest. She reached up, cupping Rio’s face, forcing her to meet her eyes. “You don’t get to protect me from <em>everything,</em> Rio. That’s not how life works. But you don’t get to protect me from <em>this,</em> either. I’m right here. I’m choosing you.”</p><p>Her thumb brushed gently across Rio’s cheek. “So if you’re going to push me away, do it now. Because I need you to know, I’m not playing this time.”</p><p>Rio’s defenses were shattered. Her hand slid to Agatha’s jaw, the other curling around her waist, pulling her in like she’d been holding back for a lifetime.</p><p>Their lips crashed together, fierce and hungry, all the tension and longing between them igniting in a single spark.</p><p>Agatha melted into her, fingers tangling in Rio’s shirt, pulling her closer. The kiss deepened, Rio tilting her head, every ounce of restraint gone. It wasn’t gentle. It was desperate, consuming, like they’d both been starved and had finally given in.</p><p>When they finally broke apart, both breathless, Agatha leaned her forehead against Rio’s, smiling through the tears pricking her eyes. “Took you long enough, hot stuff.”</p><p>Rio laughed—quiet, shaky, but real—and pulled her back into another kiss.</p><p> </p>

<p><span>The kiss left them both breathless, lingering in the quiet of the darkened bowling alley. The faint hum of the neon signs still cooling filled the silence, but neither woman moved right away. Rio’s hand stayed on Agatha’s waist, firm but trembling ever so slightly, like she wasn’t sure if she should let go.</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned back just far enough to meet her eyes. She smiled softly, the cocky grin she usually wore replaced with something gentler, almost shy. “See? Was that so hard?”</span></p><p><span>Rio huffed a quiet laugh, shaking her head. “Harder than you think.”</span></p><p><span>“You don’t have to keep running from me, darling.” Agatha’s thumb brushed along Rio’s jaw. “I’m not going anywhere. Not unless you tell me to.”</span></p><p><span>Rio swallowed, the weight of her confession still heavy in the air. “I just don’t want to fail you the way I’ve failed before.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned in, pressing her forehead to Rio’s. “You won’t. And even if something happens because life is chaos. I’d rather take the risk than pretend this doesn’t exist.”</span></p><p><span>For a long moment, Rio said nothing, just breathed her in, grounding herself in Agatha’s words. Then, finally, she nodded. A silent surrender.</span></p><p><span>Agatha grinned, stealing another quick kiss—softer this time, playful, lingering just enough to leave Rio dazed. “God, I knew you’d be good at that.”</span></p><p><span>Rio rolled her eyes, though her lips betrayed the faintest smile. “Of course you’d turn this into flirting again.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s not flirting,” Agatha corrected, tugging lightly on Rio’s shirt as she stepped back. “It’s </span><em><span>truth.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>Rio watched her retreat a few steps toward the door, already missing the warmth pressed against her. Agatha turned, smirk firmly back in place but her eyes still soft, vulnerable in a way Rio wasn’t used to seeing.</span></p><p><span>“Goodnight, hot stuff,” she murmured, and with a sway of her hips, she disappeared up the stairs.</span></p><p><span>Rio exhaled, running a hand down her face, equal parts wrecked and exhilarated. For the first time in years, she wasn’t sure if she was terrified or hopeful.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The next morning, the smell of fresh coffee drifted through the kitchen. Natasha was already seated at the table, scrolling through her phone. Clint yawned his way in behind her, and Yelena raided the fridge like she owned it. Alice leaned against the counter, nursing a mug, while Bucky stood by the back door keeping his quiet watch as usual.</span></p><p><span>Then Agatha came downstairs.</span></p><p><span>She was glowing, hair loose and tousled, lips just a little too red for someone who “hadn’t been up to anything,” her body moving with a kind of lazy ease no one had ever seen in her before. She greeted them with a cheerful, “Good morning, darlings,” and breezed past to the coffee pot.</span></p><p><span>A beat later, Rio followed, her usually unshakable composure just slightly… off. She kept her eyes on the floor, muttered a stiff “Morning,” and went straight for the fridge like she needed something to do with her hands.</span></p><p><span>The shift was immediate.</span></p><p><span>Natasha’s brow arched. Clint stifled a laugh into his mug. Yelena froze mid-bite of cold pizza and then grinned like a wolf. Alice’s eyes lit up, and even Bucky smirked faintly from his post.</span></p><p><span>“Oh my </span><em><span>god,</span></em><span>” Yelena whispered loudly. “It happened.”</span></p><p><span>“Definitely happened,” Clint agreed, leaning back in his chair with a smug grin.</span></p><p><span>Natasha didn’t look up from her phone. “Took them long enough.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha, never one to miss a cue, sipped her coffee and smirked. “You all gossip worse than my fanbase.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nearly choked on the orange juice she’d just poured. “It’s not— we didn’t—” She trailed off, ears turning crimson.</span></p><p><span>The team erupted into knowing laughter.</span></p><p><span>Even Bucky, who almost never commented on anything not mission-critical, tilted his head and rumbled, “About time.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha winked over her mug, delighting in Rio’s mortification.</span></p><p><span>Rio set the juice down a little too hard, her jaw tightening as she muttered something in Spanish under her breath. She turned on her heel, clearly ready to escape the room.</span></p><p><span>That’s when Alice stepped in, cutting her off with a hand on her arm. “Hey. Breathe.”</span></p><p><span>Rio froze, meeting her best friend’s steady gaze.</span></p><p><span>“Look, I know this freaks you out,” Alice said gently, voice pitched low so only Rio could hear. “But you’re allowed to be happy, Rio. You’re allowed to let someone in again. No one here thinks less of you. In fact, we’re rooting for you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s throat worked, but she didn’t reply.</span></p><p><span>Alice squeezed her arm once before letting go. “Don’t sabotage it because you’re scared, okay?”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded faintly, unable to form words. Her chest felt tight, but not in the old, suffocating way. In a new way. A way that whispered maybe Alice was right.</span></p><p><span>Behind them, Yelena stage-whispered, “Can we PLEASE have a wedding on a mission? I want to wear a tux.”</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned, pinching the bridge of her nose, while Agatha just cackled into her coffee.</span></p><p><span>The kitchen was still buzzing with laughter when Agatha set her mug down and slipped beside Rio, who was doing her best to look busy slicing fruit she had no real intention of eating.</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned in just close enough for her voice to be private. “You’re not overwhelmed, are you? I know people can be a lot when they’ve scented gossip.”</span></p><p><span>Rio exhaled slowly, her knife pausing mid-cut. “I’m fine,” she said, though her shoulders stayed taut.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tilted her head, studying her. “You know ‘fine’ is actress code for ‘I’m falling apart inside but my mascara still looks good.’”</span></p><p><span>That earned the faintest huff of amusement from Rio. “I don’t wear mascara.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s lips curved into a sly smile. “Shame. You’d make it look devastating.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shook her head, cheeks tinged pink, and tried to return to her task. But Agatha touched her wrist lightly. “Seriously. If this is too much—me, them, all of it—tell me. I’ll rein it in.”</span></p><p><span>Rio finally met her eyes, and there was no teasing in her voice when she answered. “You don’t need to rein it in. I can handle it.”</span></p><p><span>“Good,” Agatha said softly, before her grin snapped back into place. “Because I’m not planning on reining it in anytime soon.”</span></p><p><span>Before Rio could reply, Yelena leaned across the counter, pilfering a strawberry from Rio’s cutting board. “Ugh, are you two done being disgustingly tender? Some of us are trying to carbo-load before work.”</span></p><p><span>Clint tossed a granola bar at her head. “You don’t even </span><em><span>work,</span></em><span> you just stir trouble.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha sipped her coffee, smirking. “And she’s very good at it.”</span></p><p><span>Alice, who’d been reviewing something on her tablet, clapped her hands. “Okay, focus. Today’s schedule is full. First, Agatha is on the Drew Barrymore show, then it’s Agatha’s first official day of filming. Security checks are already lined up, Bucky’s on vehicle duty, Natasha’s handling access clearance at the gate. Clint, you’re with me on surveillance. Yelena—”</span></p><p><span>“I’m the fun one,” Yelena interrupted, mouth full of stolen fruit.</span></p><p><span>“No,” Alice corrected with a patient smile, “you’re inside with Rio, shadowing the set perimeter. Try not to pick fights with anyone.”</span></p><p><span>“No promises,” Yelena sang.</span></p><p><span>Agatha chuckled, stretching languidly in her chair. “See? Family breakfast </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> my own personal army. Who needs Hollywood when I’ve got this circus?”</span></p><p><span>“Hollywood pays the bills,” Natasha reminded her dryly.</span></p><p><span>“Ah, right.” Agatha winked at Rio. “Then let’s go make some magic.”</span></p><p><span>Rio rolled her eyes, but when Agatha brushed against her on the way out, she found herself smiling despite the chaos.</span></p><p><span>Before they left for the studio, Agatha tugged Rio into a quiet corner of the house, away from the bustle of the team checking gear and running last-minute sweeps. She folded her arms, eyes soft but serious.</span></p><p><span>“During this interview, Drew is going to bring up the photoshoot, and probably the fan speculation about us,” Agatha said. “Do we just keep this quiet between us? How much do you want me to disclose?”</span></p><p><span>Her tone was steady, but Rio could see the flicker of vulnerability there. Agatha had been in the spotlight long enough to know how invasive these questions could get, even from friends.</span></p><p><span>Rio was quiet for several beats, her jaw working before she finally spoke. “I want to keep this quiet for as long as we can. I’m not ashamed of you, and we’re not doing anything wrong, but I want to keep this as professional as possible in public.” She held Agatha’s gaze, dark eyes steady, trying to communicate everything she couldn’t quite put into words—the need to protect, the fear of losing, the line she wasn’t sure how to walk.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s expression softened. She reached out, resting her hand lightly against Rio’s chest. “Absolutely, darling. We’ll go at your pace when it comes to the public. I’ve had years to get used to this circus, you haven’t.”</span></p><p><span>Rio exhaled a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding, and Agatha tilted her chin up, closing the space between them. The kiss was tender, unhurried, fireworks in the simplest brush of lips, the kind that left both of them aching for more.</span></p><p><span>When they finally pulled apart, Agatha’s smirk returned, softer this time. “Alright, then. Let’s go give the world a show without </span><em><span>actually</span></em><span> giving them the show.”</span></p><p><span>Rio managed the faintest smile at that, then followed her back into the main hall where the team was already gathering, gear checked and ready. Within minutes, they were loading into the SUVs, headed for their first stop: Drew Barrymore’s stage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The set of </span><em><span>The Drew Barrymore Show</span></em><span> gleamed under bright studio lights, the audience buzzing as Drew swept onto the stage with her signature warmth.</span></p><p><span>“Okay, everyone, today is </span><em><span>very</span></em><span> exciting because we have with us one of my oldest and dearest friends, an actress I’ve known since we were both awkward teenagers trying to figure out which camera to look at first.” Drew beamed toward the wings. “Please welcome America’s witchiest sweetheart… Agatha Harkness!”</span></p><p><span>The audience erupted in cheers as Agatha strutted onto the stage, purple silk blouse catching the light. She and Drew embraced tightly, laughing into each other’s shoulders like old friends who’d shared a hundred inside jokes.</span></p><p><span>“Can you believe this?” Drew said as they sat down, shaking her head fondly. “We did our first movie together when we were fifteen, and now you’re, like, the face of half the internet memes.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked. “Not just memes, darling. I’m also the face of questionable tattoos and at least three thirst accounts on Twitter.”</span></p><p><span>The audience roared. Drew giggled so hard she almost snorted. “Oh my God, you haven’t changed a bit.”</span></p><p><span>Backstage, behind the camera, Rio stood with arms folded, her usual neutral expression firmly in place. But her eyes never left Agatha—not once.</span></p><p><span>Drew leaned forward eagerly. “So, let’s get into it. Marvel fans are </span><em><span>freaking out</span></em><span> about </span><em><span>Coven of Chaos.</span></em><span> This is your first Marvel Movie, joining Wanda in the MCU, what can you tell us?”</span></p><p><span>“Well, you know I can’t say much,” Agatha teased, twirling a strand of hair. “Kevin Feige has snipers, and I happen to like my life. But I can tell you that the show dives deeper into witch lore within the MCU, and let’s just say… my character is here to cause trouble.”</span></p><p><span>The audience whooped, and Drew fanned herself dramatically. “You are so good at playing bad. And speaking of Wanda—you two have this incredible on-screen friendship, and fans swear there’s something </span><em><span>more</span></em><span> there.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned back, smirking at the audience’s knowing laughter. “Wanda is one of my best friends in the world. We’ve shared sets, trailers, and a frankly unhealthy number of margaritas. But sorry to break hearts, we’re platonic. Sister-wives energy at best.”</span></p><p><span>The audience groaned playfully, and Drew wagged her finger. “You’re </span><em><span>sure</span></em><span>? Because some of those interviews…”</span></p><p><span>Agatha grinned. “What can I say? We have chemistry. Blame Wanda, she’s irresistible.”</span></p><p><span>The crowd clapped, clearly eating it up. Agatha glanced toward the wings, catching Rio’s stoic figure, and gave a sly little wink. Rio shifted on her feet, her jaw tightening just a fraction.</span></p><p><span>Drew’s eyes twinkled as she shifted gears. “Okay, so I have to bring this up because my producers would kill me if I didn’t. That </span><em><span>photoshoot.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>The audience screamed before Drew even finished the sentence.</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed, covering her face. “Oh, God, I knew this was coming.”</span></p><p><span>“You and your new security, Rio Vidal.” Drew leaned in conspiratorially. “First of all, that photoshoot was… whew. I needed a fan. And second—who </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> this woman? Because the internet is convinced you two are the new Brangelina.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha dropped her hands and smirked directly at the camera. “Rio is my bodyguard. She’s professional, terrifyingly competent, and if you believe my fans, singlehandedly responsible for about sixty percent of the sapphic internet losing their minds. I would be jealous of her claiming my throne, but I, too, am one of the sapphics losing my mind. ”</span></p><p><span>The audience howled.</span></p><p><span>“Actually,” Drew said, picking up a card, “I have some examples. Do you want to hear a few thirst tweets?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha clapped her hands. “Oh, please, let’s traumatize my poor security detail.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes narrowed from the sidelines, but Drew began reading with glee.</span></p><p><span>“@AgathasCoven: Agatha’s new bodyguard has </span><em><span>tattoos for days,</span></em><span> and I just know she could ruin me in every possible way.”</span></p><p><span>The audience shrieked. Agatha gasped dramatically, fanning herself. “They’re not wrong, darling.”</span></p><p><span>“@Witchy4Rio: Who do I talk to about getting Rio Vidal to step on me while reciting her kill count in Spanish?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha threw her head back laughing. “Oh, </span><em><span>that’s</span></em><span> a good one. I may have to steal that line.” She turned and gestured toward Rio offstage. “Did you hear that, dear? You’ve got groupies now.”</span></p><p><span>Rio gave her the blankest look imaginable, but the faintest flush rose up her neck.</span></p><p><span>Drew, still grinning, shuffled her cards. “And don’t worry, Agatha, I didn’t forget you. Because the fans have </span><em><span>plenty</span></em><span> to say about you, too.”</span></p><p><span>“Of course they do,” Agatha smirked, crossing her legs with mock vanity.</span></p><p><span>“@HexedandBlessed: Agatha in that black suit? I saw the photos and immediately forgot how to breathe.”</span></p><p><span>The audience cackled. Agatha smirked wickedly, mouthing </span><em><span>you’re welcome</span></em><span> to the camera.</span></p><p><span>“@DarklingDreamer: If loving Agatha Harkness in leather pants is wrong, then lock me up and throw away the key.”</span></p><p><span>“Darling, that’s the best confession I’ve ever heard,” Agatha purred.</span></p><p><span>“And finally—” Drew could barely get it out through her giggles, “@WitchPlease: Agatha’s smirk in that shoot made me gay again. Yes, </span><em><span>again.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>The audience was in stitches, clapping and cheering. Agatha preened, tossing her hair. “What can I say? I’m a public service.”</span></p><p><span>Drew couldn’t stop giggling. “The internet is unhinged, and I love it.”</span></p><p><span>“But seriously,” Agatha added once the laughter died down, “Rio and her team are here to keep me safe. That’s their priority. The rest is just… noise.” She paused, shooting another wicked little smirk at Rio. “Very, very </span><em><span>loud</span></em><span> noise.”</span></p><p><span>Drew cackled. “I love you so much.”</span></p><p><span>“I know,” Agatha winked. “I love me too.”</span></p><p><span>The two dissolved into laughter, the audience cheering with them, while Rio silently prayed for strength behind the camera.</span></p><p><span>The rest of the interview went by quickly after that. The second Agatha stepped offstage, the roar of the audience still echoing, she spotted Rio leaning against the wall, arms folded tight across her chest. The bodyguard’s face was composed, but her ears were still pink from Drew reading those tweets aloud.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sauntered over, a smug grin firmly in place. “You know, </span><em><span>tattoos for days</span></em><span> might be my favorite one. Though personally, I’d have said tattoos for </span><em><span>nights,</span></em><span> since I tend to imagine you more in—”</span></p><p><span>Rio cut her off with a low groan, pressing a hand to her forehead. “Agatha, please. I’m begging you.”</span></p><p><span>“Begging, hm?” Agatha purred, delighting in the way Rio froze. “Good to know.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shot her a look that was equal parts exasperated and flustered, then muttered something under her breath in Spanish before pushing off the wall. “We’re leaving before you get us both in trouble.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed, looping her arm through Rio’s as if nothing was more natural. “Fine, darling. But admit it, you secretly love the chaos.”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t answer, but the twitch of her lips was enough to give her away.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>By the time they made it to the film set to begin the first day of shooting Coven of Chaos, the playful energy had dissipated, Agatha in actress mode and Rio in full protector mode. Trucks lined the perimeter, crew members hauled equipment across the asphalt, and walkie chatter echoed from every direction. To most, it looked like organized chaos. To Rio, it looked like a hundred potential vulnerabilities.</span></p><p><span>She stepped out of the SUV first, scanning the lot with sharp, deliberate precision. Bucky peeled off immediately to do a second perimeter check, Natasha headed for the gate to liaise with studio security, and Clint moved to a rooftop vantage point with a long lens camera. Alice stayed with the surveillance van, laptop open and headset on, eyes flicking between feeds.</span></p><p><span>Yelena fell into step beside Rio, chewing gum like she didn’t have a care in the world, but her eyes were as sharp as Rio’s.</span></p><p><span>“Place looks clean,” Yelena muttered, shoving her hands in her jacket pockets. “But I don’t like it.”</span></p><p><span>“Neither do I,” Rio replied quietly, her gaze tracking a women lingering too long by a lighting rig. Her hand twitched toward her comm, but then she saw the badge. Crew. Still, she filed her face away.</span></p><p><span>Agatha exited the SUV a moment later, sunglasses on, hair and makeup already flawless. Jen hovered close with her ever-present binder, Billy a few steps behind, arms full of garment bags. Agatha flashed a smile at the photographers hired by the studio to document the first day, but Rio could see how tight her grip was on her coffee cup.</span></p><p><span>“Rio, darling,” Agatha drawled, “you’re scowling again. People will think you don’t like being here.”</span></p><p><span>“I don’t,” Rio said flatly, never taking her eyes off the crowd.</span></p><p><span>Yelena snorted. “She means she doesn’t like people she can’t control.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha raised an amused brow. “Hot stuff, if you’re this tense now, what will you be like when I actually start filming?”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t answer. She was watching a shadow slip just behind one of the trailers—too fast to be crew, too deliberate to be casual.</span></p><p><span>“Yelena.”</span></p><p><span>“I see it.” The blonde’s gum stilled as her posture straightened, hand brushing the inside of her jacket where a blade was tucked.</span></p><p><span>“Stay casual,” Rio murmured. “We’re not spooking the actress on her first day.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha glanced between them, sensing the sudden shift in tone. Her smile faltered. “What is it?”</span></p><p><span>Rio forced her expression neutral. “Nothing you need to worry about yet. Go on. Meet your director. We’ve got you covered.”</span></p><p><span>Yelena leaned close as Agatha walked away with Jen and Billy. “Gut says we’ve got company.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes narrowed at the trailer. “Mine too.”</span></p><p><span>Neither woman moved, but their shoulders squared, their attention locked like predators circling unseen prey. Whatever was waiting for them today, it was already here.</span></p><p><span>Rio followed Agatha inside while Yelena peeled off to check the possible intruder. Rio’s gut told her something was wrong—and her gut had never let her down. She stayed in Agatha’s shadow, close enough to intervene, but just far enough to let the actress move freely.</span></p><p><span>Agatha slipped into full-on actress mode the moment she spotted Peggy, the director. They laughed, going over the day’s schedule.</span></p><p><span>“Today is mostly blocking,” Peggy explained warmly. “Positions, lighting, making sure everything flows. We’ll shoot one scene—the first time your character is finally free from the bindings the Scarlet Witch put on you. Wanda won’t be on set until later in the week, so we’ll frame it without her for now.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded, absorbing it all. It sounded like a simple day, at least on paper.</span></p><p><span>Rio blended into the background, scanning constantly, her posture deceptively relaxed. Agatha asked smart questions, offered thoughtful suggestions to deepen her character, and Peggy took them all in stride.</span></p><p><span>Yelena’s voice crackled through comms. “False alarm on our suspicious person. Just an assistant who had a bathroom emergency. Don’t ask how I found that out. Heading back now.”</span></p><p><span>Rio had to bite back a laugh. Relief flickered through her, but the prickling at the back of her neck never eased. Something was still off.</span></p><p><span>She glanced up toward the catwalk above the stage—just in time to see the clip holding one of the heavy lights straining, metal warping under pressure.</span></p><p><span>Her blood ran cold.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha—!”</span></p><p><span>Rio sprinted forward, diving at the actress just as the clip gave way. She tackled her to the ground, shielding her with her own body as the massive light crashed down, shattering inches from where Agatha had been standing only seconds before.</span></p><p><span>The crash reverberated through the soundstage like thunder, glass and metal scattering across the floor. Crew members screamed and dove out of the way. The director’s chair clattered backward as Peggy lurched to her feet, shouting for safety.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s arms locked around Agatha as they hit the ground, her body caging the actress in, shielding her from debris. For a heartbeat, all Agatha could register was the weight of Rio’s body pressed against hers, her rapid heartbeat thundering in her chest, and the way her perfume still clung to her skin even through the chaos.</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked up, dazed.</span></p><p><span>Rio eyes were sharp, scanning above them, tracking the catwalk. Her voice rang through the comms, clipped and urgent. “Possible sabotage. Catwalk, northeast quadrant. Lock it down.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes, ma’am,” Natasha’s voice replied instantly.</span></p><p><span>Yelena swore in Russian through the line. “On it.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky’s voice followed, low and grim. “I’m already moving.”</span></p><p><span>Rio finally pushed herself up enough to check Agatha over, her hands brushing over her arms, her waist, her face with uncharacteristic urgency. “Are you hurt?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha, still a little breathless, shook her head. “No, I’m fine. Thanks to you.” She tried to sit up, but Rio kept her firmly pressed down for another beat, as if she didn’t trust the world not to collapse on her again.</span></p><p><span>The crew was in chaos, people shouting, someone radioing for medics, Peggy barking orders to clear the stage. Jen and Billy stood frozen watching in shock.</span></p><p><span>Alice’s voice came through comms, calm but urgent. “I’m rewinding camera feeds now. That clip didn’t just fail, it looks like it was tampered with.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw tightened, her gut twisting. She knew it.</span></p><p><span>“There was a women I saw up their earlier, she was wearing a crew badge, but something felt off about her, try and find her,” Rio ordered</span></p><p><span>She hauled Agatha gently to her feet, keeping a protective hand at the small of her back as she guided her away from the wreckage. Agatha leaned in close, her voice quieter now, more serious. “That wasn’t an accident, was it?”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s silence was answer enough.</span></p><p><span>The set lights still buzzed overhead, the wreckage of the fallen lamp smoking faintly at their feet. But Rio’s focus was entirely on Agatha, making sure she stood, unshaken, alive.</span></p><p><span>Rio silently vowed: whoever was behind this, they’d just declared war.</span></p><p><span>Rio, flanked by Alice and Natasha, moved swiftly at Agatha’s side as they guided her back toward the trailer. Jen and Billy ran alongside them finally coming out of their daze. Peggy intercepted them, face pale with worry, reaching for Agatha.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha, are you alright? I—”</span></p><p><span>Natasha stepped neatly between them, voice calm but firm. “Later. Right now, our priority is getting her safe.”</span></p><p><span>Peggy hesitated, torn between concern and the authority of the security team, then nodded tightly. “Fine. But someone is going to answer for this.” She turned on her heel, already barking orders at the crew, demanding explanations and accountability.</span></p><p><span>The small formation pressed forward. Clint and Bucky joined in seamlessly, closing ranks around Agatha, their presence forming a wall of quiet steel. Yelena’s voice crackled faintly over comms, she was still up on the catwalk, already interrogating crew members and snapping photos of the broken clip for evidence.</span></p><p><span>Agatha walked in silence, every step a little heavier than the last. She kept her head high, sunglasses still perched like armor, but Rio could feel the tremor in her movements. With the team’s bodies surrounding her, the chaos of the set faded behind them, replaced by the low hum of radios and the heavy press of what-ifs lingering in the air.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stopped walking, completely frozen. Agatha turned to face them all, mask cracking just a little. “I almost died,” she admitted quietly, like the words tasted strange on her tongue. Her eyes flicked to Rio’s, searching for something solid to hold onto.</span></p><p><span>“You didn’t,” Rio said firmly, almost fiercely, as if sheer will alone had made it true. She led Agatha to her trailer.</span></p><p><span>Inside the trailer, the air was still, too still. Rio’s instincts screamed before her eyes even registered the details. She raised a hand, halting Agatha in the doorway. Alice slipped past her with weapon drawn, Natasha right behind, moving in a fluid sweep of the space.</span></p><p><span>Seconds later, Alice’s voice came sharp. “Clear. But… you need to see this.”</span></p><p><span>Rio guided Agatha inside carefully, keeping her body angled just slightly in front of her. The familiar warmth of the trailer had been shattered, literally. The vanity mirror had been smashed, jagged pieces scattered across the floor like glittering teeth. Agatha’s stack of fan mail had been torn open and shredded, bits of half-chewed paper littering the carpet as if rats had gnawed their way through her privacy.</span></p><p><span>But it was the bed that stopped them all cold. Jen gasped.</span></p><p><span>On top of the carefully made covers lay a single piece of paper, the words scrawled in thick, uneven strokes:</span></p><p><b>Now try to ignore us. You belong to us.</b></p><p><span>Agatha’s breath caught audibly, her hand flying to her mouth. She swayed, and Rio caught her by the elbow before she could stumble. Billy rests his hand on her back, trying to hold her up as well.</span></p><p><span>Natasha bent, gloved fingers hovering over the note without touching. “They were in here recently. The air’s still cold from the AC being reset.”</span></p><p><span>Alice was already at the door, scanning the lock with narrowed eyes. “No forced entry. Whoever it was had access. Either a duplicate key or inside help.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s grip tightened on Agatha’s arm, grounding her. “You’re safe now. We’re here.”</span></p><p><span>But Agatha’s eyes were locked on the broken mirror, her reflection fractured into a hundred jagged shards. For the first time, the mask of the untouchable actress slipped completely. Her voice trembled. “They were </span><em><span>this close.</span></em><span> In my space. In my bed. They tried to KILL me!”</span></p><p><span>Rio gently turned her away from the sight, pulling her against her chest, as her own gut twisted with fury. “We’ll find them.” Rio kissed the side of Agatha’s head, hoping to bring comfort. </span></p><p><span>The team exchanged tense looks around her, unspoken understanding sparking between them. This wasn’t random. It was the Stalker. And it had just escalated.</span></p><p><span>The trailer felt smaller with every second that passed. Rio made the call without hesitation. “We’re pulling her. Now.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha scooped the note into an evidence bag, Bucky collected photos of the damage, and Alice swept the doorway for prints. Yelena rejoined them with a stormy expression, jaw tight from whatever she’d pried out of the crew.</span></p><p><span>Within minutes, the team had Agatha moving. Clint and Bucky formed a wall at the front, Natasha and Yelena took the flanks, Alice watched the rear. Rio stayed glued to Agatha’s side, her hand hovering just at her back, ready to catch her if her knees gave out again.</span></p><p><span>They didn’t linger. Through the lot, past Peggy’s frantic questions, through the crowd of gawking crew, the team moved with precision, ignoring the stares. Rio didn’t let anyone get close.</span></p><p><span>The SUV doors slammed shut one by one, the bubble of security sealing tight around her again.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sat pressed into the leather seat, sunglasses shielding her eyes though the sun had already started going down. She didn’t say a word. Her hand, however, found Rio’s on the seat between them, gripping it hard, like she needed something tangible to tether her to the moment.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t pull away. She only squeezed back, silent, as the convoy pulled out and carried them toward the only safe place left—home.</span></p><p><span>The convoy pulled through the gates, engines rumbling to a stop in tight formation. The team spilled out quickly, weapons and instincts already tuned to danger. Natasha barked orders for a perimeter sweep, Bucky checked the garage access, and Yelena stalked toward the back fence like she dared the stalker to be there waiting.</span></p><p><span>Rio stayed at Agatha’s side, her hand warm and steady at the small of her back. “Come with me.” Her tone left no room for argument, though it was soft enough that Agatha didn’t bristle.</span></p><p><span>She guided her inside, past the bustle of the others securing the house, and down a quiet hallway. Only when they reached the study, a small room lined with maps, files, and a sturdy oak desk, did she stop. She shut the door firmly behind them.</span></p><p><span>For a moment, Agatha stood frozen, still wrapped in the armor she always wore. Shoulders squared, chin lifted, lips pressed into a tight line. But Rio just stepped closer, steady and unyielding, and said gently, “You don’t have to hold it together for me.”</span></p><p><span>That undid her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s breath hitched, then broke. She crumpled forward into Rio’s chest, the first sob tearing out of her like it had been clawing at her ribs all day. Rio caught her easily, arms wrapping around her, holding her like she’d never let go.</span></p><p><span>“They were </span><em><span>in my trailer,</span></em><span>” Agatha choked, her voice muffled against Rio’s shirt. “They touched my things, my bed—God, they could’ve been standing over me while I slept, they tried to kill me, why are they doing this?” Agatha rambled. </span></p><p><span>“Shh,” Rio murmured, her voice low and steady, one hand stroking slow circles between her shoulder blades. “You’re safe now. I’ve got you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha clung to her, fingers curling into the fabric at her back, shaking with every breath. It wasn’t the poised star or the sharp-tongued flirt now; it was just a woman who’d been pushed to the edge, terrified and vulnerable.</span></p><p><span>And Rio held her through it, letting her fall apart, strong enough for both of them until Agatha could stand again.</span></p><p><span>Downstairs, a little while later, Rio joins the team after putting Agatha to bed, after finally getting her to calm down. Jen and Billy both agree to stay the night, sleeping in the same bed with Agatha, so she isn't alone. </span></p><p><span>The dining room had been converted into a temporary command center. Laptops hummed, photos and maps were spread across the table, and half a dozen cups of coffee stood forgotten as the team gathered.</span></p><p><span>Alice tapped the trackpad of her laptop, pulling up a grid of images on the big monitor mounted to the wall. “Okay. I’ve been combing through every candid, paparazzi shot, and social media post of Agatha over the entirety of her career. At first, I didn’t notice anything, but after cross-referencing patterns, I found her.”</span></p><p><span>A woman’s face appeared on screen, pulled from a long-distance photo. She was in the background, blurred, but unmistakably there. Blonde hair, sharp cheekbones, eyes fixed on Agatha.</span></p><p><span>“At first she looks… almost smitten,” Alice said, cycling through images. In each one, the woman lingered somewhere behind Agatha, sometimes across a street, sometimes in a crowd at a premiere. Always watching. In the earlier photos, her expression was soft, affectionate, almost dreamlike.</span></p><p><span>Alice advanced to later years. “But the longer it goes on, the more it changes.” The woman’s features hardened in each new frame. Happy glances turned into scowls. Admiration shifted into resentment. In one shot, her fists were clenched at her sides as Agatha laughed with a co-star. “She disappears entirely for almost a decade. Nothing. And then…”</span></p><p><span>The most recent photo appeared. Taken just last week, outside a restaurant. The woman stood across the street, partially hidden by a lamppost. Her eyes were locked on Agatha with open fury.</span></p><p><span>“She’s back,” Alice said grimly. “And she’s not alone. The note said </span><em><span>us.</span></em><span> This is a group.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky leaned forward, arms crossed. “Makes sense. The shooter Natasha chased wasn’t working solo.”</span></p><p><span>“That shooter,” Natasha began, her tone colder than ice. “We got confirmation.” She pulled up another file. A mugshot filled the screen. “Ralph Bohner. Low-level criminal, mostly petty theft and assault. His DNA matched the blood he left on the street when I clipped him.”</span></p><p><span>“Except Ralph isn’t a problem anymore,” Clint added. “He turned up dead this morning in an abandoned car lot downtown. Gunshot to the head, execution style. Somebody silenced him.”</span></p><p><span>Yelena scoffed, kicking her boots up on the table. “Clean-up job. Whoever’s pulling the strings didn’t want him talking.”</span></p><p><span>Alice frowned and clicked into another document. “There’s more. Ralph Bohner was married for a few years to Raven Corvin. Ring a bell?”</span></p><p><span>Natasha’s brows lifted. Rio’s jaw tightened.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah,” Clint muttered. “That was Agatha’s old assistant, right?”</span></p><p><span>Alice nodded. “Fired after Agatha caught her stealing jewelry and… underwear.” She winced at the word. “Raven disappeared after that, no jobs, no public record. Until now, when her ex-husband shows up trying to plant trackers on Agatha’s car.”</span></p><p><span>Yelena let out a low whistle. “Stealing her underwear? That’s a special brand of obsessed.”</span></p><p><span>“Which means Raven has motive,” Clint said. “But Ralph wasn’t any mastermind. He was just muscle.”</span></p><p><span>“Exactly,” Alice agreed, her tone sharper now. “They’ve got money, connections, inside access. We’re talking about slipping people onto closed sets, tampering with trailers, and bribing studio security. That doesn’t happen without serious pull.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha nodded once, her face cold. “Whoever is leading this isn’t some random ex-assistant. They’re well connected. Powerful enough to bankroll operations, buy loyalty, and dispose of liabilities when they’re no longer useful.”</span></p><p><span>“Like Ralph,” Bucky muttered. “Dead weight, literally.”</span></p><p><span>Rio looked around the table, her jaw tight. “From this point forward, we’re not protecting Agatha from a stalker. We’re protecting her from an organized group with a leader smart enough to stay hidden. They’ve been watching Agatha for years. </span><span>They know her habits, her homes, her vulnerabilities. And now they’re escalating. We can't afford any gaps or complacency; this is only going to get worse until we catch these guys."</span></p><p><span>Silence settled for a moment as the weight of it sank in.</span></p><p><span>Natasha broke it. “So the question is what’s their endgame? Obsession? Revenge? Or something worse?”</span></p><p><span>No one answered, but the grim looks around the table said it all. Whatever it was, they weren’t finished.</span></p>

<p><span>The house was quiet, but the living room was alive with the hum of tension. Papers littered the table in neat but overwhelming stacks, photos marked with red circles, lines drawn from face to face, lists of names and motives pinned down in Rio’s sharp handwriting. It was organized chaos, and she hadn’t slept a minute.</span></p><p><span>One by one, the rest of the team drifted in. Alice arrived first, scrolling through her phone for updates, eyes already sharp. Bucky came next, gripping the coffee pot like it was keeping him alive. Clint leaned against the wall, too alert for someone who’d only just rolled out of bed. Natasha appeared calm as ever, and Yelena scowled at her sister’s composure as she twisted her hair up into a bun.</span></p><p><span>Rio straightened from the table, her voice steady and commanding. “We slept on it, now it’s time to put a plan of action in place. Here’s what we know so far: this isn’t one person—it’s a group. The muscle handled Ralph, and when he outlived his usefulness, they cut him loose permanently. We’ve traced hacks in Agatha’s old security feeds to at least two separate individuals, which means two hackers. There’s the saboteur who rigged the lights, the infiltrator who got into Agatha’s trailer, and then the mastermind—the one funding everything, pulling the strings. We can’t say for certain that’s the whole roster, but those are the confirmed roles.”</span></p><p><span>“Right,” Clint said, nodding. “And we can safely assume Raven is in the mix somewhere. We don’t know which role yet, but we’ll find out.”</span></p><p><span>Rio handed out folders, crisp and color-coded. “Clint, Bucky, you tap your CIA contacts. Find the hackers, track their movements, figure out how they’re staying hidden. Natasha, Yelena, you two are best at flushing people out. Find Raven. Alice, run facial recognition on the blonde from the paparazzi photos. Cross-reference with security footage, see if we can nail down her name. Also, run the sketch I made of the figure on the catwalk yesterday, and try to find stills of whoever entered Agatha’s trailer. Our top priority is identifying these individuals, then neutralizing them—by any means necessary.”</span></p><p><span>Alice nodded, already typing.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s gaze swept across the team. “From here on out, every crew member on set is run through extensive background checks. IDs are verified, no exceptions. Alice and Clint stay behind today to monitor feeds in case someone wants to try lying in wait at the house or breaking in. Everyone else comes with me and Agatha. She does not breathe without two sets of eyes on her. I’ll also call Maria and request two more agents for permanent house security so we can focus on taking the offensive.”</span></p><p><span>She let the silence settle for a moment before she added the part weighing most heavily.</span></p><p><span>“And don’t underestimate the mastermind. To infiltrate sets, bypass security, pay off guards, and hire fall guys, that takes money, influence, and connections at a high level. We’re not dealing with amateurs. This is someone powerful enough to move people like chess pieces, and we’ve only just started pulling at the threads.”</span></p><p><span>The room went still, the weight of her words pressing down on everyone present. This wasn’t just about obsession anymore.</span></p><p><span>It was about power.</span></p><p><span>And whoever was pulling the strings wasn’t planning to stop until Agatha belonged to them.</span></p><p><span>The team began dispersing to their assignments, but Rio stayed behind, pacing the length of the living room with her phone already at her ear. The fatigue from a sleepless night pressed against her temples, but her voice was steady when Maria picked up on the second ring.</span></p><p><span>“Talk to me,” Maria said without preamble.</span></p><p><span>“We need reinforcements,” Rio said. “Agatha’s stalkers aren’t amateurs. We’ve confirmed it’s a group, possibly networked. We’re looking at multiple roles—hackers, infiltrators, muscle—and a mastermind with money and serious connections. I want two more people stationed at the house full time. That frees us up to focus on tracking and extraction.”</span></p><p><span>There was silence on the line, just Maria processing. Then: “Who do you want?”</span></p><p><span>“Sonya. She’s former Russian Special Forces, ex-KGB. She knows Yelena, they’ve worked together before. That rapport means they’ll fall into rhythm fast.” Rio stopped pacing, pressing a hand to the back of her neck. “And Steve Rogers. If there’s anyone I trust to hold this line when we’re spread thin, it’s him. He’s steady, disciplined, and he won’t crack under media pressure if this escalates further.”</span></p><p><span>Maria let out a soft exhale. “Big guns, Rio. You’re pulling from the top shelf.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s because this isn’t a game anymore,” Rio said quietly. Her eyes drifted to the stairs where Agatha was still asleep, oblivious to the war being mapped out downstairs. “Send them in as soon as possible.”</span></p><p><span>“You’ll have them by tomorrow morning,” Maria promised. “Hold the line until then.”</span></p><p><span>The call ended, and Rio set the phone down, bracing her hands on the table. Relief flickered through her, but only for a moment. With Sonya and Steve on their way, the house would be stronger, but the fact that they even needed that kind of backup only confirmed how dangerous this had become.</span></p><p><span>The house had gone quiet again, the buzz of the debrief fading as everyone slipped into their tasks. Jen and Billy came down the stairs, fixing themselves coffee.</span></p><p><span>“Any progress on finding the bastards who tried to kill Agatha yesterday?” Billy asked, his jaw tight, voice sharp with anger. His fists were clenched at his sides, and for once, his usual warmth was buried under fire. He had known Agatha his whole life—Wanda and her had been close friends since before his birth. To him, Agatha wasn’t just a boss. She was a constant, a protector, sometimes even a second mother. When he’d first offered to be her assistant, Agatha had hesitated. But with Wanda’s insistence, and his own persistence, she’d let him in. And Billy took that trust personally.</span></p><p><span>“Yes,” Rio said evenly, her voice a calm counterweight to his fury. “My team and I have uncovered a lot. More than I expected this quickly. But I’d rather explain once, to you guys and Agatha so nothing gets lost in translation.” She glanced up the staircase. “She’s still asleep?”</span></p><p><span>Jen, who was perched on the arm of the couch with her phone in hand, nodded. “Out cold. For once.”</span></p><p><span>Rio exhaled through her nose, some of the tension in her shoulders loosening. “Good. Let her rest. She needs it more than she’ll ever admit.”</span></p><p><span>Billy gave a stiff nod, but his hands were still trembling with the urge to </span><em><span>do something</span></em><span>. “Fine. But the second she’s awake, I want to hear everything. She deserves to know who’s coming after her. And I want to know how we stop them.”</span></p><p><span>Rio met his gaze, steady and unflinching. “Trust me, Billy. No one wants them stopped more than I do.”</span></p><p><span>A little while later, Rio climbed the stairs slowly, each step heavier than the last. For all her discipline, for all the walls she’d built, she found herself hesitating outside Agatha’s door.</span></p><p><span>She knocked lightly, then pushed the door open.</span></p><p><span>Agatha was still in bed, tangled in the purple sheets, the morning light spilling across her skin in golden stripes. She stirred, blinking awake, then smiled faintly when she saw Rio standing there.</span></p><p><span>“You look like hell,” Agatha rasped, voice husky with sleep.</span></p><p><span>Rio huffed a laugh despite herself. “Didn’t sleep.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stretched lazily, the blanket slipping lower. “Of course you didn’t. Always protecting everyone but yourself.” Her eyes softened. “What time is it?”</span></p><p><span>“Late morning. We’ve got a busy day ahead, so I thought I’d wake you.” Rio lingered by the doorway, suddenly unsure if stepping closer was crossing a line. But then Agatha reached out, crooking a finger.</span></p><p><span>“Come here, soldier.”</span></p><p><span>Rio obeyed before she could overthink it, crossing the room and sitting on the edge of the bed. Agatha shifted, propping herself up on her elbows, close enough now that Rio could smell the faint trace of her perfume—warm, spiced, uniquely her.</span></p><p><span>For a beat, neither spoke. The storm of yesterday, the threats of today, the looming unknown, they hung over them like smoke. But here, in this room, it was quiet. Just the two of them.</span></p><p><span>Agatha reached out, her fingers brushing the back of Rio’s hand, then sliding higher to her wrist. “You’re allowed to breathe, you know. To have something good, even in all this.”</span></p><p><span>Rio swallowed hard, every instinct telling her to pull back, to keep that last wall intact. But then Agatha leaned in, her lips hovering just shy of hers, waiting.</span></p><p><span>Rio closed the distance.</span></p><p><span>The kiss was soft at first, tentative, then deeper as Agatha tilted her head and tugged her closer by the collar of her shirt. Rio let herself go, just for this moment, hovering over Agatha on the bed, one hand cupping Agatha’s jaw while the other held her up to keep her weight off the actress below. Agatha moaned into her mouth, a sound that made Rio’s stomach flip, and soon they were tangled together, the storm outside the door forgotten.</span></p><p><span>When they finally broke apart, breathless, Agatha pressed her forehead against Rio’s. “See? Not so scary.”</span></p><p><span>Rio let out a shaky laugh, her thumb tracing Agatha’s cheek. “Terrifying,” she whispered. “But worth it.”</span></p><p><span>For the first time in what felt like forever, the world outside didn’t matter. Not the stalkers, not the war brewing. Just them, stealing a moment of calm before the storm crashed down again.</span></p><p><span>“You ever going to let us go all the way, hot stuff? Or are you the wait-till-after-marriage kind of gal?” Agatha teased, her voice low and playful. She was refusing to let her mind drift back to yesterday’s chaos, clinging instead to this moment—to the warmth of the woman she was quickly, dangerously falling for.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s lips quirked into a smile. “I can’t think about that right now, </span><em><span>hermosa</span></em><span>. But the day will come. First, I want to take you on a real date. I’m old-fashioned that way. But don’t worry—” her eyes deliberately swept down Agatha’s body, lingering just long enough to make her squirm—“I definitely won’t be able to wait till marriage.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s breath hitched at the trail of those eyes. Heat coiled low in her belly. “So what I’m hearing,” she said, grinning wide enough to show all her teeth, “is that you want to marry me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio silenced her the best way she knew how—by kissing her. The kiss quickly deepened, melting into another long, heated tangle of lips and hands, neither willing to let go until they forced themselves apart before things spun too far.</span></p><p><span>They pulled back, breathless, foreheads pressed together. Agatha reached up, brushing her thumb along Rio’s jawline, her smirk softening into something raw. “Stunning,” she whispered. No innuendo. No deflection. Just truth.</span></p><p><span>Rio caught her hand, turned it, and pressed a kiss into the inside of her wrist, lingering for a second before standing. “My team uncovered a lot last night,” she said gently. Not the usual clipped, commanding tone, but softer, more human. “Get showered and dressed, then meet us downstairs. We’ll go over everything together. We’ll need your help identifying people, and your insight into the ones we already suspect.”</span></p><p><span>For once, Agatha didn’t crack a joke or deflect. She just nodded, eyes following Rio until she slipped out of the room.</span></p><p><span>The smell of fresh coffee lingered in the kitchen as Jen and Billy sat at the counter, scrolling through their phones while the security team murmured in the living room. It had been a long twenty-four hours, and both of them were running on caffeine and nerves.</span></p><p><span>Agatha descended the stairs 45 minutes later, freshly showered, hair still damp and curling at the ends. She looked relaxed, almost glowing in a way neither of them had seen since the whole stalker ordeal began. She padded across the kitchen, breezing past Rio, who was leaning over the table with papers spread out, and without breaking stride, Agatha let her hands rest on Rio’s hips in a casual, familiar way before continuing toward the coffeepot.</span></p><p><span>Rio looked back at Agatha and gave a soft, shy smile.</span></p><p><span>Jen’s jaw dropped. Billy’s phone slipped out of his hand and clattered onto the counter. Both turned in unison, wide-eyed, then looked back at each other.</span></p><p><span>“Oh my </span><em><span>god</span></em><span>,” Jen whispered loudly, leaning toward Billy. “Rio finally pulled her head out of her ass.”</span></p><p><span>Billy’s grin spread so wide it nearly split his face. “I knew it! I </span><em><span>knew</span></em><span> it!” He slapped the counter for emphasis.</span></p><p><span>Agatha glanced over her shoulder, smirking like the cat who caught the canary. “What’s with the faces? Don’t tell me you’re surprised. I </span><em><span>am</span></em><span> irresistible, after all.”</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Agatha…”</span></p><p><span>Jen practically vibrated with glee. “No, no, don’t you </span><em><span>Agatha</span></em><span> this away! Do you have any idea how unbearable she’s been since you got here? I’ve been spraying her with a water bottle like she’s a misbehaving cat, and it </span><em><span>still</span></em><span> didn’t stop her.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha poured her coffee and leaned lazily against the counter, mug in hand, utterly unbothered. “Persistence pays off, darling.”</span></p><p><span>Billy laughed so hard he nearly knocked over his cup. “I can’t wait to tell my mom. She owes me fifty bucks!”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s head snapped up. “You two were </span><em><span>betting</span></em><span> on us?”</span></p><p><span>Jen grinned like the devil himself. “Oh, honey. Everyone was betting on you two.”</span></p><p><span>Rio muttered something in Spanish under her breath, cheeks heating as Agatha only looked more pleased with herself.</span></p><p><span>For the first time in days, the tension in the house gave way to laughter.</span></p><p><span>Rio spread the files out across the dining table, her usual precision on display as she slid each photo and document into neat stacks. Jen and Billy sat on one side, Agatha on the other, her mug of coffee steaming between her hands. She looked composed, but Rio caught the faint tightness in her jaw, a lingering echo of yesterday’s close calls.</span></p><p><span>“Alright,” Rio began, her tone clipped but calm, “here’s where we stand. We know this isn’t a lone wolf. It’s a group. Roles we’ve identified so far: two hackers, a saboteur, an infiltrator, the muscle who took out Ralph, and a mastermind funding everything.”</span></p><p><span>“Who the fuck is Ralph?” Jen asks confused</span></p><p><span>Rio tapped the folder in front of her. “Ralph Bohner’s confirmed dead. His DNA matched that of the person whom Natasha had clipped during the chase after he tried to plant trackers on Agatha’s car. He was married to Raven Corvin—Agatha, you fired her years ago for theft.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, memory flashing. “Yeah. Jewelry, clothes… underwear. Creepy little thief. I knew I’d see her again one day.”</span></p><p><span>Rio gave a short nod. “Exactly. Which means Raven has motive, and now Ralph’s gone, she may be even more unhinged.” She flipped to the next photo—a series of paparazzi shots stitched together on a board. “Alice also flagged this woman. She shows up in the background of your photos for years. At first, she looks happy, infatuated even. But the more recent ones—bitterness, resentment. Then she disappears entirely… until last week.”</span></p><p><span>She slid the clearest shot of the blonde forward. Agatha stiffened, her grip tightening on the coffee mug.</span></p><p><span>“I know her,” she said flatly.</span></p><p><span>Billy leaned forward. “You do?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled slowly, eyes fixed on the photo. “She used to run my biggest stan account on Twitter. At first, I thought she was just another obsessed fan, but then she came to a con, got backstage. She tried to… sleep with me.” Her voice soured, disgust rolling under it. “She was underage. I rejected her immediately and cut all contact. But she didn’t take it well. I blocked her, had my team keep her away from events, but clearly… she didn’t let it go.”</span></p><p><span>Jen’s brows furrowed. “Do you remember her name?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded grimly. “Renna. That’s all I ever got. Just Renna.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw clenched, her pen digging into the paper as she wrote it down. “That helps. A name, even a partial one, is more than we had yesterday. Alice can run it against known aliases and tie it back to the photos. If she resurfaces again, we’ll find where.”</span></p><p><span>The table fell into silence, the weight of it sinking in. For years, Renna had been circling Agatha’s life like a shadow. And now she wasn’t lurking in the background anymore.</span></p><p><span>She was moving center stage.</span></p><p><span>“I know this feels like a lot, Agatha,” Rio said softly, her tone cutting through the tension. “But we’ve already identified two suspects. We know their roles, and tomorrow two more guards will arrive to stay at the house full-time. That means the rest of us can focus entirely on you. We </span><em><span>are</span></em><span> making progress, I promise.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s jaw tightened. The frustration wasn’t aimed at Rio, but at the situation itself, at the constant shadow stalking her every move. She squeezed Rio’s hand in silent thanks and brushed a quick kiss across her lips.</span></p><p><span>Before Rio could respond, Jen’s phone lit up with rapid notifications, buzzing like a hornet’s nest. At the same time, Agatha’s phone started ringing nonstop.</span></p><p><span>Billy frowned. “Did the media find out about what happened yesterday on set?”</span></p><p><span>Jen glanced at her screen, her face draining of color. “No. It’s worse. #BoycottAgatha is trending. Someone just dumped a flood of false claims, saying you’re rude to fans, that you scream at crew, and that you are a diva.”</span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>WHAT?!</span></em><span>” Agatha’s voice cracked through the room, sharp with horror. She knows what happens to women in Hollywood who get labeled as difficult to work with: they don't get jobs.</span></p><p><span>The entire security team came charging in from the other room, hands already hovering near weapons, eyes scanning for danger.</span></p><p><span>“What happened?” Natasha asked calmly, her gaze sharp as a blade.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw flexed as she forced her voice to stay level. “The stalker group is going on the offensive again. This time, they’re aiming for her reputation. If they can’t get to her physically, they’ll destroy her in the court of public opinion.”</span></p><p><span>Jen paled further. “Oh God—it just got worse. There’s a deepfake video going viral right now. It shows you screaming at an assistant and shoving them. And ‘sources’ are popping up, claiming they were harassed or bullied by you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hands shook as she grabbed her phone, her voice ragged. “That’s a lie. I would </span><em><span>never</span></em><span>—I’ve always treated every crew member with respect. I—” She broke off, breathing too fast, panic rising like a wave.</span></p><p><span>Billy rushed to the fridge, yanking out a bottle of cold water and pressing it into Agatha’s hands. “Here. Drink.”</span></p><p><span>Rio slid closer, a steady hand rubbing slow circles into Agatha’s back. “Breathe, </span><em><span>hermosa</span></em><span>. We’ll fix this.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked up at her desperately. “How? If we pull the video, people will just say I’m hiding something. If I deny it, they’ll say I’m lying. How do I fight shadows?”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s voice sharpened, all business now. “Here’s the plan. Alice will run a forensic program on the video. Every deepfake has a tell; we’ll prove it’s fabricated. Jen, you start contacting everyone who’s ever worked with Agatha. Directors, crew, co-stars, get them posting to their socials. Drown the lies in real testimonials.”</span></p><p><span>Jen nodded quickly, already typing.</span></p><p><span>Rio turned back to Agatha, her eyes locking onto hers. “And you, you think carefully. Do you have a trusted journalist? Someone you’re close with, but not publicly tied to? We’ll bring them in, have them shadow you on set. They’ll talk to the crew directly and write a piece that dismantles these lies before they stick. We don’t just defend—we </span><em><span>turn</span></em><span> the narrative.”</span></p><p><span>The room held still for a beat, every set of eyes on Agatha. She clutched the water bottle, breath still uneven but steadier now, a flicker of fire returning to her gaze.</span></p><p><span>“Jessica Jones,” Agatha said after a moment of thought, her voice steadier now. “We met years ago. No photos, no public appearances together. But we’re good friends. She’s respected, used to write for </span><em><span>Access Hollywood</span></em><span>, now works for the </span><em><span>L.A. Times</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s lips curved into the faintest nod. “Good. Call her. Ask her to come shadow you on set today. We’ll give her enough of the truth to frame the story, then let her leak just enough. Once the public sees what’s really happening, that you’re the target of a smear campaign, they’ll rally. They’ll turn on the ones spreading these lies.”</span></p><p><span>Jen tapped furiously on her phone, already drafting a message. “And the timing’s perfect. If Jessica’s piece starts circulating today, we can drown out the deepfake before it gets another twenty-four hours of traction.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled slowly, the panic ebbing as a clear path took shape. She still hated that it had come to this, fighting ghosts and shadows in the media instead of scripts and cameras, but with Rio’s hand steady at her back and the plan laid out, she finally felt the ground beneath her feet again.</span></p><p><span>Billy looked between them all, his expression fierce. “So we fight fire with fire.”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Rio corrected quietly, but firmly. “We fight lies with truth. And we win.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha slipped into the study, shutting the door softly behind her. Her hands still trembled, but she steadied them enough to scroll through her contacts. Jessica’s name was there—buried under years of people she hadn’t spoken to in forever—but the second she saw it, relief hit her like a breath of fresh air.</span></p><p><span>She pressed call.</span></p><p><span>The line rang once, twice. Then came a familiar, gravel-edged voice: “Harkness? Either the world’s ending or you butt-dialed me, and if it’s the second, I’m hanging up.”</span></p><p><span>Despite everything, Agatha laughed—a real one, short and sharp. “It’s the first, darling. And I wouldn’t call you unless it was important.”</span></p><p><span>Jessica hummed, skeptical. “I saw the hashtag. BoycottAgatha, right? Thought it was bullshit. What’s going on?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha sank into the leather chair, closing her eyes. “I don’t have time for details over the phone. But I need your help. Come to set with me today. Shadow me, talk to the crew, write what you see. You know me better than most—you know this isn’t who I am.”</span></p><p><span>There was a beat of silence. Then Jessica’s voice sharpened. “You’re telling me someone’s coming after you?”</span></p><p><span>“Yes. A group, actually. They’re organized, dangerous, and now they’re trying to destroy me publicly because they can’t get to me physically.”</span></p><p><span>Another pause, then the sound of a cigarette lighter flicking on. “Alright. I’m in. Text me the address. And Agatha?”</span></p><p><span>“Yes?”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t bullshit me when I get there. If you want me to help, I need the </span><em><span>real</span></em><span> story.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smiled faintly. “Wouldn’t dream of doing otherwise.”</span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>The studio lot buzzed with its usual chaos: crew hauling cables, cameras rolling across the floor, production shouting back and forth. But Rio’s team had already turned the place into a fortress. Natasha was at the gate, Bucky circling the perimeter, Yelena high on a catwalk, pretending to be casual but watching like a hawk. Everyone, including the crew, was on high alert after the events of yesterday.</span></p><p><span>The black SUV pulled up to the side entrance. Rio went first, scanning, then motioned for the others to stand down as Jessica Jones stepped out.</span></p><p><span>Dressed in her usual leather jacket, dark jeans, and boots, she looked like she owned the place already. Her sunglasses came down just enough for her to glance at Rio. “So, you’re the infamous Rio. You look like you could break me in half. Good. I like knowing Agatha’s in one piece.”</span></p><p><span>Rio gave a curt nod, stone-faced, though the corner of her mouth twitched almost imperceptibly.</span></p><p><span>Jessica turned to Agatha, who was waiting just inside the doorway. “Jesus, Harkness. Leave you alone for five minutes and you’ve got a death cult on your ass.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked, though her eyes softened at the sight of her old friend. “What can I say? I’m popular.”</span></p><p><span>Jessica’s lips quirked. “Popular, sure. But not invincible. Now, ” she pulled out her notebook, flipping it open, “show me where the skeletons are buried. If someone’s trying to ruin you, I’ll make damn sure the world sees who’s holding the shovel.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped in close to Agatha, murmuring low enough only she could hear. “I like her.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha grinned, brushing her hand over Rio’s arm before striding onto set with Jessica in tow. “Told you she was the right one for this.”</span></p><p><span>The studio was buzzing when Agatha stepped onto set with Jessica shadowing her like a storm cloud in boots. Crew members nodded politely, some outright staring, the kind of quiet awe Agatha always drew in professional spaces. But Jessica wasn’t watching like a fan. She was watching like a hunter—taking in body language, the energy of the room, how people reacted when Agatha walked by.</span></p><p><span>Rio stayed close, always in Agatha’s shadow but never crowding her. Jessica clocked that instantly, the way Rio’s gaze never stopped scanning. Protective. Calculating. A fortress in a suit.</span></p><p><span>Agatha slipped into “leading lady” mode with ease. She greeted Peggy warmly, joked with the makeup team, and even teased a PA about tripping over their own shoelaces. Jessica scribbled notes: </span><em><span>Professional. Lighthearted. Not a diva. Crew at ease around her.</span></em><span> She muttered under her breath, “Yeah, real monster, my ass.”</span></p><p><span>After ten minutes of watching, Jessica slipped away, working her way toward the craft table where a few crew members were clustered. She introduced herself casually, not flashing credentials, just letting her name settle. Once recognition hit, the tension eased, and they started talking.</span></p><p><span>“She’s one of the best people I’ve worked with,” a camera operator said. “Remembers names, makes sure everyone gets thanked. Bought the crew lunch out of her own pocket a few days ago.”</span></p><p><span>“She actually listens,” another chimed in. “If you suggest something that’ll make the shot better, she hears you out. Doesn’t act like she’s above anyone.”</span></p><p><span>Jessica nodded, jotting it all down. Then one of them leaned closer, lowering his voice.</span></p><p><span>“The thing that rattled people the most wasn’t the headlines—it was the light. That thing would’ve crushed her if security hadn’t been paying attention.”</span></p><p><span>Jessica’s pen stilled. “The light?”</span></p><p><span>The man nodded. “Came down out of nowhere, like the clip just snapped. But I’ve been in this business a long time—gear doesn’t just </span><em><span>fail</span></em><span> like that. Not with fresh rigging. Someone messed with it.”</span></p><p><span>Jessica’s jaw tightened. “Convenient no one outside the set heard about that.”</span></p><p><span>She moved on, circling toward the wardrobe department, and got another tidbit: Agatha’s trailer. A mirror was smashed. Fan mail shredded like an animal had gotten to it. And then, the note.</span></p><p><span>Jessica underlined the words in her pad three times: </span><em><span>Now try to ignore us. You belong to us.</span></em></p><p><span>By the time she circled back toward the central monitors, she found Jen with her phone glued to her ear, barking into it at lightning speed. Jessica waited until she hung up before stepping in.</span></p><p><span>“Jones,” Jen said, giving her a once-over. “Figured Agatha would pull you in. She trusts so few people.”</span></p><p><span>Jessica smirked. “Smart woman. Fill me in—what are you dealing with on your end?”</span></p><p><span>Jen sighed, rubbing her temple. “My job’s damage control. I’m calling every producer, every director, every PA Agatha’s ever worked with. If the internet wants to paint her as some kind of tyrant, I’m going to flood the timeline with firsthand accounts that prove otherwise. She’s got a spotless record, and I intend to remind people of that. But the lies spread faster than truth, and the deepfake video? That’s my nightmare. Once an image burns into people’s minds, it doesn’t matter how fake it is.”</span></p><p><span>Jessica tapped her notebook. “Then we give them more powerful images. Her working, laughing with the crew. Being </span><em><span>herself.</span></em><span> I’ll handle the narrative—you keep her allies talking.”</span></p><p><span>Jen gave a sharp nod, her respect for Jessica clear.</span></p><p><span>Jessica’s next stop was Peggy. The director was pacing by the monitors, headset slung around her neck, eyes flashing as she oversaw blocking. Jessica caught her between instructions.</span></p><p><span>“You’ve worked with her long?” Jessica asked.</span></p><p><span>“Off and on for about 15 years,” Peggy said, not missing a beat. “She’s always been like this—sharp, generous, funny. Never pulls rank. And if someone tries to? She’s the first to defend the crew. Look—do you think I’d still be working with her if she was even a fraction of what they’re saying? I’d have shut her down myself. She’s family to me.”</span></p><p><span>Jessica jotted it down, satisfied.</span></p><p><span>Finally, she found Billy near the trailers, nervously scrolling through his phone. He perked up when he saw her.</span></p><p><span>“You’re Jessica, right? Agatha’s friend?”</span></p><p><span>Jessica nodded. “That’s me. You’re her assistant?”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah. But she’s… more than that. She’s basically family. She was there my whole life. I know her better than most, and I can promise you, she’s not what they’re painting her as. She’s tough, sure, but she’s kind. She gives a damn. Sometimes too much, honestly. She hides when she’s scared so no one else has to see it, but I do. She’s hurting. And it’s killing me to watch her go through this.”</span></p><p><span>Jessica closed her notebook slowly. She didn’t need to write that one down. It was already burned into her head.</span></p><p><span>By the time she returned to Agatha’s side, her notes were full, her instincts razor sharp. She stood back for a moment, watching Agatha work, commanding, charismatic, magnetic. She wasn’t barking orders, wasn’t sneering at assistants. She was </span><em><span>leading.</span></em></p><p><span>Jessica muttered under her breath, “These bastards picked the wrong woman to try and tear down.”</span></p><p><span>She flipped her notebook shut, turning toward Rio, who was still scanning the catwalks like the soldier she’d always be.</span></p><p><span>“Your girl’s got every single person here ready to go to war for her,” Jessica said quietly.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t look away from the rafters. “She deserves better than this circus.”</span></p><p><span>Jessica’s voice softened, just slightly. “Then I’ll make sure the world knows it. You keep her alive, Vidal. I’ll keep her untouchable.” Jessica said, before she took her leave to begin writing the article</span></p><p><span>For the first time all day, Rio’s lips curved into a faint, fleeting smile.</span></p><p><span>The day on set came to a close; luckily, nothing eventful happened, and Agatha and the team were able to make it back home safe and without incident. </span></p><p><span>Agatha lay on the couch, her head in Rio’s lap, a Wine glass in hand. Bucky and Yelena are on perimeter sweep while the rest of the team takes their breaks and sleeps while they can. Jen is on the sectional to their right, and Billy has gone to his room and is fast asleep. </span></p><p><span>“Jessica released her article,” Jen said, smiling already seeing the positive reactions pouring in.</span></p><p><b>L.A. Times Exclusive</b><b><br/></b> <em><span>By Jessica Jones</span></em></p><p><b>The Witch Hunt Against Agatha Harkness: Why the Rumors Don’t Add Up</b></p><p><em><span>The internet loves a scandal. And right now, Agatha Harkness—the actress beloved by millions for her sharp wit, magnetic screen presence, and unapologetic queerness—is the target of one.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Over the past twenty-four hours, hashtags calling for a boycott of Harkness have exploded across social media. Allegations range from the absurd (that she bullies crew and belittles fans) to the damning (a falsified video circulating online shows her allegedly screaming at and shoving an assistant).</span></em></p><p><em><span>But after spending a day on set with Harkness and speaking with those who know her best, I can tell you this: the narrative being spun is a fiction designed to destroy her.</span></em></p><p><b><em>A Career Built on Respect, Not Fear</em></b><b><em><br/></em></b><em><span> I spoke with camera operators, grips, hair and makeup staff, and the director herself, Peggy Carter. Every one of them described the same Agatha: collaborative, kind, quick to laugh, generous to crew, and fiercely protective of those around her.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“She’s one of the best people I’ve ever worked with,” one camera operator said. “Remembers names, thanks people personally, and never acts like she’s above anyone.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“She’s family,” Carter told me bluntly. “If she were even a fraction of what they’re claiming, I’d have shut her down myself years ago.”</span></em></p><p><b><em>The Deepfake Problem</em></b><b><em><br/></em></b><em><span> Experts are already analyzing the viral video. Early analysis shows hallmarks of manipulation—facial warping in frames, mismatched shadows, unnatural voice syncing. In other words, it’s a fake.</span></em></p><p><em><span>But the damage is in the circulation. Deepfakes don’t need to be real to ruin reputations—they just need to be believable enough to plant doubt.</span></em></p><p><b><em>A Pattern of Escalation</em></b><b><em><br/></em></b><em><span>What makes these smears more chilling is what’s happening off-camera.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Yesterday, while rehearsing, a stage light came crashing down inches from Harkness. Security intervened in time, but the equipment had been deliberately tampered with. Later, her trailer was broken into. A mirror smashed, fan mail shredded. A threatening note was left on her bed: Try to ignore us now, you belong to us</span></em></p><p><em><span>This is not the behavior of critics or random trolls. This is targeted harassment. A campaign. And now, it’s bleeding into the public sphere with lies meant to isolate her.</span></em></p><p><b><em>The Woman Behind the Headlines</em></b><b><em><br/></em></b><em><span> On set, I watched Agatha Harkness work. I saw how the crew smiled when she approached, how she made jokes to ease tension, how she threw herself into rehearsal with the same fire that’s made her a household name for decades.</span></em></p><p><em><span>This is not a tyrant. This is not an abuser. This is an actress—one who has fought tooth and nail to carve her place in an industry that wasn’t built to welcome her.</span></em></p><p><em><span>The smear campaign against Harkness is exactly that: a campaign. Manufactured. Strategic. And dangerous.</span></em></p><p><b><em>Why It Matters</em></b><b><em><br/></em></b><em><span>Because if they can take down Agatha Harkness with lies and fakes, they can take down anyone.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Hollywood has always had its villains. But this time, the real villains aren’t on screen. They’re in the shadows—organized, well-connected, and escalating.</span></em></p><p><em><span>The world deserves to know the truth. And Agatha Harkness deserves to keep telling her story—on her terms, not theirs.</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“Your plan worked Rio, social media is blowing up and rallying behind Agatha #StandwithAgatha #ProtectAgatha and #AgathaSupremacy are trending, major news outlets are backtracking, celebrities are rallying.” Jen said smiling from ear to ear relieved. She was unsure of Rio’s plan at first but seeing it work in real time is a relief. </span></p><p><b>@WitchyAgatha</b><span>: Jessica Jones doesn’t play. That article laid out every single lie.

I don’t know how we would’ve managed this without your idea,” she added, her voice full of gratitude.</span></p><p><span>“I guarantee this will make the stalkers tuck tail and hide for a while, after their plan backfired so drastically,” Rio said, running her hands gently through Agatha’s hair.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stayed silent, staring at her screen, her expression unreadable. Rio gave Jen a look. Jen caught it, nodded, and quietly excused herself, wishing them both a good night before heading to one of the spare guest rooms to crash.</span></p><p><span>A few more minutes of silence passed, Rio giving Agatha the space to process. Then Agatha finally looked up at her, eyes shimmering with unshed tears.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve spent my whole career waiting for the world to turn on me, Rio,” she whispered. “To decide I wasn’t worth loving anymore, like my mother did. And now, seeing them defend me like this… it’s terrifying and comforting all at once.”</span></p><p><span>Rio reached over, covering Agatha’s restless hand with her own, grounding and steady. “You earned this, Agatha. Their love. Their loyalty. You didn’t trick them into it, and no smear campaign can erase who you are.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a trembling laugh, though her eyes glistened. “You always know what to say, don’t you?”</span></p><p><span>Rio shook her head. “Not always. But with you, the truth is easy.”</span></p><p><span>That answer seemed to melt something in Agatha. She shifted closer, curling her fingers over Rio’s hand and pressing a gentle kiss to her knuckles. “You make me feel like I can finally breathe again,” she admitted, her voice raw but steady. “Like I don’t have to keep performing when the cameras stop rolling.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s chest tightened at the confession. She leaned in, brushing her thumb along Agatha’s jaw, the smallest of touches but heavy with meaning. “That’s all I want for you. To be able to just… be.”</span></p><p><span>The silence between them wasn’t heavy now, it was warm, grounding, alive. Agatha’s lips curved into the softest of smiles, and for once, there was no teasing in it. Only truth.</span></p><p><span>Rio exhaled slowly, then made a decision. “Agatha,” she began, her voice lower, careful but sure, “you need a break. From the spotlight. From the chaos. You’ve given everything to everyone else for years, it’s time someone gave you something back.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha tilted her head, curiosity flickering in her eyes. “And what are you suggesting, hot stuff?”</span></p><p><span>Rio met her gaze directly, no hesitation. “Come away with me. To my cabin. Just us. No cameras. No fans. No stalkers. Just quiet, peace, and maybe a proper date.”</span></p><p><span>For a moment, Agatha froze, caught between surprise and the way her heart leapt at the offer. Then her lips parted into a grin, genuine, unguarded, and maybe a little in love. “A cabin in the woods with you? Sounds like the start of a scandalous novel. But sweetheart,” She brushed her hand across Rio’s cheek, eyes sparkling. “It also sounds like exactly what I need.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled, small but certain, and pressed her forehead to Agatha’s. “Then it’s a date.”</span></p>

<p><span>Rio woke early, as always, and carefully untangled herself from Agatha’s arms. They hadn’t meant to fall asleep on the couch, but conversation had stretched late into the night until they were too comfortable—too wrapped up in each other—to bother moving.</span></p><p><span>When she sat up, she froze. Alice and Yelena were sprawled across the opposite couch, identical shit-eating grins on their faces, phones in hand snapping pictures of the two of them snuggled together.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t you two have anything better to do than watch me sleep?” Rio groaned, dragging a hand down her face.</span></p><p><span>“Nope,” Yelena said brightly. “I’m on my break. What about you, Alice? Anything better to do?”</span></p><p><span>Alice smirked without missing a beat. “Not really. It’s my turn to guard Agatha, so technically I </span><em><span>am</span></em><span> doing my job.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shot them both a look, but before she could retort, a muffled grumble came from the crook of her neck. “Why are you guys talking so loud?” Agatha mumbled, her face still buried against Rio’s skin.</span></p><p><span>Rio softened immediately, brushing her hand down Agatha’s arm. “We’ve got to get up, </span><em><span>hermosa</span></em><span>. Get packed and ready to go.”.</span></p><p><span>Alice frowned and pulled up Agatha’s schedule on her tablet, “Packed to where? There’s nothing on her schedule that requires travel.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m taking her out of town for the weekend,” Rio said firmly, gently peeling Agatha off her side. “She needs to decompress after everything with the stalkers. A little quiet will do her good.”</span></p><p><span>Yelena tilted her head, instantly serious. “Are you sure that’s safe? Those stalkers aren’t going anywhere. Shouldn’t you bring backup? At least one more person?”</span></p><p><span>“The stalkers are going to lay low for a while after Jessica Jones dragged them into the light,” Rio countered. “And the cabin I’m taking her to is remote. It’s not tied to me in any official way, so they won’t be able to trace us there. I’ll share the location with you and the others, and I’ll check in every couple of hours so you know we’re safe.”</span></p><p><span>Alice and Yelena exchanged a look, then Yelena shrugged. “Fine. But if you two lovebirds end up in trouble, I’m bringing a spray bottle and dragging you home myself.”</span></p><p><span>“Vidal, the reinforcements are here,” Bucky announced, poking his head in before heading back outside.</span></p><p><span>Sonya and Steve stepped into the room, both straightening immediately. They extended their hands, which Rio clasped firmly in turn.</span></p><p><span>“Thank you both for coming. I’m sure Maria briefed you, so I won’t bother repeating it. Your priority is this house, no infiltration, no tampering of any kind. This group has pulled that off before, and I won’t let it happen again,” Rio said, locking eyes with each of them to make her point clear.</span></p><p><span>“Yes, ma’am,” Steve replied with a sharp nod, his voice steady and resolute. “We’ve been briefed and are ready to do whatever it takes to defend our client and this home.”</span></p><p><span>“I have no doubt,” Rio answered. “That’s why I asked for you two specifically. Yelena will show you around the grounds, and you’ll relieve Natasha and Bucky. Ms. Harkness and I will be going out of town for the weekend, but you’ll treat this house as if she were still here.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha, now fully awake, perched on the arm of the couch and looked the new arrivals over with open appreciation. “Okay, seriously, where do you recruit from? Every single one of you looks sculpted by the gods. Save some attractiveness for the rest of us.” She gave a low wolf-whistle, which earned her a sharp glare from Rio.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t worry, hot stuff,” Agatha added breezily, waving her off. “You’re still my favorite, and the most attractive one here.”</span></p><p><span>Rio rolled her eyes, but the fondness in her expression betrayed her.</span></p><p><span>“Thank you, ma’am,” Sonya said, her accent thick with steel and certainty. “It is an honor to guard you. No one will get past us, at least, not alive. On that, I can promise you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha arched a brow. “Are </span><em><span>all</span></em><span> Russians terrifying, or just the women?”</span></p><p><span>“Just the women,” Yelena and Sonya answered at the same time, exchanging a knowing smile.</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned her elbows on the back of the couch, smirking. “Wait—you two know each other? Yelena, is this the mysterious girlfriend you’ve been refusing to tell me about?”</span></p><p><span>Yelena barked out a laugh. “No. This is Sonya. We grew up together, trained in the same assassin school. Known each other our whole lives.”</span></p><p><span>Sonya said something in Russian, and Yelena smirked but kept it to herself, only replying with a glint of amusement in her eyes.</span></p><p><span>“Come on,” Yelena said, leading Steve and Sonya away. She and Sonya were already trading words in Russian, their voices carrying as they headed outside.</span></p><p><span>Rio turned back to Agatha. “Go start packing and get ready. I just need to finalize a few things before we leave. Pack for both cold and warm weather.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha rose, tilting her head. “You going to tell me where this cabin is, darling?”</span></p><p><span>“Nope,” Rio said, leaning in to brush a quick kiss against her lips before heading toward the door. “You’ll just have to trust me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio finished debriefing the team on the plan. Skepticism lingered in their expressions—none of them were thrilled about her going alone with Agatha—but in the end, they trusted Rio. If anyone could keep Agatha safe, it was her. And if anything did happen, they knew Rio was more than capable of handling it.</span></p><p><span>A little while later, Agatha came downstairs, freshly showered, dragging a suitcase behind her. Rio was by the front door, murmuring something to Alice and chuckling at her reply. The moment she noticed Agatha, Rio straightened and hurried over, immediately relieving her of the suitcase with ease.</span></p><p><span>“So, any clues on where you’re taking me?” Agatha asked, her eyes glittering with playful curiosity as she tried to pry a sliver of information out of her bodyguard.</span></p><p><span>Rio only smiled, shaking her head as she led her toward the underground garage. She opened the passenger door of her personal vehicle, a sleek Lincoln Aviator SUV, gesturing for Agatha to climb in before stowing both their bags in the trunk.</span></p><p><span>Rio slid into the driver’s seat, the leather creaking softly under her weight. “I’ll tell you on the plane, </span><em><span>cariño</span></em><span>,” she said, pulling smoothly out of the garage and toward the back of the property.</span></p><p><span>They passed through the hidden exit, the reinforced back gate swinging open at Yelena’s signal. She gave Rio a knowing wink and Agatha a cheeky salute before closing the gate securely behind them.</span></p><p><span>“So this requires a plane,” Agatha said, raising a brow. “At least tell me—are we staying in California?”</span></p><p><span>Rio glanced at her, lips curving faintly. “Not a big fan of surprises, are you?”</span></p><p><span>“Absolutely not,” Agatha chuckled, shaking her head. “Never have been.”</span></p><p><span>Rio sighed in mock defeat, but there was warmth in her voice when she replied. “Fine. I’ll tell you, so you stop asking every three seconds and maybe enjoy the plane ride.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha perked up, leaning a little closer.</span></p><p><span>“We’re going to my cabin in Massachusetts,” Rio explained. Her voice softened as she continued, eyes focused on the road. “When I was finally medically cleared and came back stateside, my therapist told me I needed a project, something to keep my mind busy, to stop me from getting lost in memories. My dad was from Massachusetts. He always wanted to return, and I guess… I felt drawn there too. So I bought a piece of land and built the cabin myself. It took me a year, but it gave me purpose when I needed it most.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha watched her intently, not interrupting, sensing the weight of what Rio was sharing.</span></p><p><span>“It’s not even in my name,” Rio added quietly. “I had it put under Valkyrie’s. It was… my way of honoring her.”.</span></p><p><span>The car fell into a thoughtful silence after Rio’s admission, the hum of the road filling the gaps. Agatha let her hand linger over Rio’s, thumb brushing gently against her knuckles. For once, she didn’t fill the air with a quip or tease. She simply held on, her silence a quiet promise that she understood the weight of what Rio had shared.</span></p><p><span>By the time they reached the small private airstrip, dusk was painting the sky in warm streaks of orange and violet. Rio guided the SUV toward the hangar where a sleek private jet waited. It wasn’t marked with any airline insignia, just glossy white and anonymous.</span></p><p><span>Agatha arched a brow as they stepped out, tugging her coat a little tighter against the evening breeze. “A private jet? Darling, I knew you were full of surprises, but this one takes the cake.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked faintly, shouldering both their bags with ease. “It’s not mine. One of my former clients lends it out when I need to move without drawing attention. Anonymous, untraceable, and more secure than commercial flights.”</span></p><p><span>“Anonymous?” Agatha echoed, lips curling into a sly grin. “So you’re telling me no one will know where we are, where we’re going, or who we’re with?”</span></p><p><span>“Exactly.” Rio shot her a side glance, but the sharp edge in her eyes was softened by amusement. “And don’t even start, Agatha. This isn’t the setup for whatever scandalous thing you’re about to suggest.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha gasped dramatically, pressing a hand to her chest. “You wound me, hot stuff. I was only going to say how utterly romantic it is. Just us, alone, flying off into the sunset. Very movie-star runaway with her bodyguard chic.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shook her head, but couldn’t stop the corner of her mouth from twitching.</span></p><p><span>Inside, the jet was as plush as Agatha expected; cream leather seats, polished wood accents, and soft lighting that made the space glow with warmth. Rio set their bags aside and checked the cabin, ever vigilant, before finally taking a seat across from her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha immediately stretched out, crossing her legs and leaning back with the ease of someone perfectly at home. She tilted her head, watching Rio with open curiosity. “So, you built an entire cabin with your own two hands. Tell me, Vidal—can you do anything that doesn’t make me want to fall harder for you?”</span></p><p><span>Rio looked up sharply, caught off guard, her ears tinting pink. “Agatha…”</span></p><p><span>“What?” Agatha teased, her grin slow and dangerous. “It’s a valid question.”</span></p><p><span>Rio sighed, trying and failing to suppress a smile. “Eat your snacks and enjoy the peace, </span><em><span>cariño</span></em><span>. That’s what this trip is for. Rest. Quiet.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned forward, eyes glinting. “Darling, I’ll rest when I’m dead. But quiet? With you around? I don’t think I want that.”</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned, leaning her head back against the seat. “You are impossible.”</span></p><p><span>“Maybe,” Agatha said, settling back with a smug little smirk, “but I’m </span><em><span>your</span></em><span> impossible.”</span></p><p><span>The engines hummed to life, and the jet rolled forward into the fading light, lifting them away from the noise and chaos of L.A. Agatha finally felt the tension ease from her shoulders. Just the two of them, alone in the sky.</span></p><p><span>The jet hummed as it lifted into the air, smooth and steady. Agatha lounged across her seat like she owned the plane, one leg crossed over the other, sunglasses perched on her nose even though the cabin lighting was dim.</span></p><p><span>“Not bad, sweetheart,” she drawled, giving the plush leather a slow once-over. “Whisking me away on a private jet? You know, some women would kill for this kind of treatment.”</span></p><p><span>Rio raised an eyebrow, buckling her belt. “Good thing you already have enough stalkers trying to kill for you. No need to add more.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha gasped dramatically, pressing a hand to her chest. “You wound me. Here I thought you were trying to sweep me off my feet, and instead you’re just worried about logistics.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked faintly, glancing out the window. “This isn’t me sweeping you off your feet, Agatha. This is me getting you somewhere safe.”</span></p><p><span>“Safe,” Agatha repeated, leaning forward so her voice dipped lower, more teasing. “Funny, because every time I look at you, I feel like I’m in </span><em><span>danger.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned, tipping her head back against the headrest. “You really can’t help yourself, can you?”</span></p><p><span>“Not when you sit there all stoic and broody in your suit,” Agatha purred, twirling her sunglasses in her hand. “Do you know how unfair it is? Tattoos peeking out of your cuffs, muscles under that shirt, and those eyes…” She let the words trail, clearly enjoying Rio’s slow flush.</span></p><p><span>Rio cleared her throat, leaning forward to grab a folder from her bag just to break eye contact. “I swear, you’re worse than Yelena with her knives.”</span></p><p><span>“Darling,” Agatha said with a grin, “the difference is I want to </span><em><span>play</span></em><span> with you, not stab you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s head snapped up, eyes wide, caught between scandalized and flustered. “Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>“What?!” Agatha laughed, throwing her head back. “Don’t look at me like that. I didn’t even say anything dirty this time. You just went there all on your own.”</span></p><p><span>Rio pinched the bridge of her nose, muttering something under her breath, which only made Agatha grin wider.</span></p><p><span>“You know, cariño,” Agatha said, stretching out like a cat, “I think I’m starting to enjoy these little trips. Just you, me, and miles of sky. No one to bother us. Endless possibilities.”</span></p><p><span>Rio gave her a long look, a mix of warning and fondness. “Endless trouble, more like.”</span></p><p><span>“Same thing,” Agatha quipped, raising her glass of water in mock salute before sinking back into her seat, a smirk still firmly in place.</span></p><p><span>For the first time in days, the air between them felt lighter, still charged, still simmering with things unsaid, but light all the same.</span></p><p><span>The rest of the plane ride was filled with laughter, sharp quips, and a cutthroat game of checkers that escalated far too quickly. Agatha, scowling at her imminent defeat, flipped the board with a dramatic flourish, red and black pieces scattering across the plush carpet.</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed—really laughed. It burst out of her in a way that startled Agatha, deep and unguarded, a sound that made the small cabin feel warmer. Agatha froze mid-smirk, her breath catching as she watched Rio’s head tip back, hair slipping over her shoulder, her sharp jawline cutting against the soft light overhead. For the first time since they met, Rio looked utterly relaxed, and Agatha couldn’t stop staring.</span></p><p><span>Five and a half hours slipped by faster than either expected. When the jet finally touched down, the runway was silent, the private airfield deserted save for a sleek black Lexus parked near the hangar. The pilots taxied them smoothly to a stop, and Rio rose first, thanking the crew and sliding them a tip with her usual quiet efficiency.</span></p><p><span>“Ready, </span><em><span>hermosa</span></em><span>?” she asked, extending a hand to Agatha.</span></p><p><span>“After watching you cheat at checkers for five hours? Barely,” Agatha teased, slipping her hand into Rio’s anyway. Her fingers lingered longer than necessary before she let go, descending the steps with a little bounce in her step.</span></p><p><span>The Massachusetts air was crisp and cool, carrying the faint scent of pine and lake water even here. Agatha inhaled deeply, stretching her arms like a cat. “It already feels like we’re in a different world,” she murmured.</span></p><p><span>Rio only hummed in agreement, leading her toward the waiting car. She opened the passenger side door for Agatha before loading their bags into the trunk. Agatha slid into the seat with a grin.</span></p><p><span>“Sweetheart,” she said, tapping the dashboard as Rio settled behind the wheel, “if this is just the car that takes us to your secret hideaway, I can only imagine how good the cabin looks.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked, starting the engine. “Patience. You’ll see soon enough.”</span></p><p><span>“Patience isn’t really my strong suit,” Agatha shot back, turning to watch the treeline blur as they pulled away from the airfield.</span></p><p><span>Rio glanced at her, lips twitching into something that wasn’t quite a smile but wasn’t far from it. “I’ve noticed.”</span></p><p><span>The drive wound through tall pines and quiet country roads, the air outside crisp and clean in a way only deep woods could manage. By the time Rio pulled the SUV to a stop, the sky was painted in streaks of soft pink and gold, fading into dusk.</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned forward in her seat, sunglasses pushed up into her hair as she gazed at the cabin. The structure rose out of the trees with warm amber light glowing from the windows, logs dark and rich against the soft stone chimney. A porch stretched wide across the front, and beyond the treeline, Agatha caught the glimmer of water from the lake. It looked like something out of a storybook, peaceful, private, almost too good to be real.</span></p><p><span>“You built this?” she asked, her voice quieter than she intended, a rare note of awe breaking through.</span></p><p><span>Rio cut the engine and nodded in pride. “Every inch of it. Took me a year, and more splinters than I care to admit.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked, leaning back in her seat. “Splinters and sweat, huh? That’s one way to make a lesbian’s heart race.”</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned softly, shaking her head as she got out of the car. “We just got here, Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>“Exactly,” Agatha said sweetly, stepping out after her and stretching like a cat. “What better way to christen a new chapter than innuendo?”</span></p><p><span>Rio shot her a look, but it lacked heat. She grabbed both suitcases and started up the gravel path. Agatha followed, her heels crunching against stone, eyes still drinking in every detail.</span></p><p><span>The inside was even better—vaulted ceilings with exposed beams, tall windows spilling in the last light of day, the whole place smelling faintly of cedar and woodsmoke. Cozy but not cramped. Lived in but not cluttered.</span></p><p><span>Agatha whistled low, circling slowly. “Well, sweetheart, I have to hand it to you, you’ve got taste. Rustic, private, hauntingly romantic. Tell me you don’t bring women here often, because I’d hate to think I’m not special.”</span></p><p><span>Rio set down the bags by the stairs and turned, one brow arched. “You’re the first, </span><em><span>hermosa</span></em><span>. And you’re not special. You’re trouble.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s grin softened, just a touch. “Same thing, darling.”</span></p><p><span>For a moment, neither spoke. The woods outside were hushed, the lake reflecting the dimming sky like glass. Agatha stepped closer, brushing her fingers along the edge of the stone fireplace, before turning to Rio with a look that was half playful, half earnest.</span></p><p><span>“Feels like the kind of place you come to heal,” she said.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes flickered, something unspoken in them, but she gave a small nod. “That was the idea.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smiled, gentler now. “Then I promise not to cause too much chaos. At least not the kind that involves broken light fixtures and stalkers.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked faintly, shaking her head. “I’ll believe that when I see it.”</span></p><p><span>“So, can I get a tour of the place or would you like me to just snoop and pretend I’m not?” Agatha smiled. Rio smiled and waved at Agatha to follow.</span></p><p><span>Rio led Agatha down the short hallway, her voice steady as she gestured to each room. Two guest bedrooms—simple but comfortable, the beds neatly made, each with a view of the trees. At the end, Rio paused at the open doorway to her own room.</span></p><p><span>Dark green sheets covered the wide bed, a folded quilt resting at the foot. A couple of framed photographs sat on the dresser: one of Rio’s parents, another of a much younger Rio in uniform with her team. Agatha lingered in the doorway, smirked like she wanted to say something, but for once, she held her tongue.</span></p><p><span>“The bathroom’s here,” Rio said, steering her away, her tone just a little tighter.</span></p><p><span>They stepped out onto the back deck. The lake stretched across the night, still and black beneath the stars, moonlight catching on its ripples. Adirondack chairs waited near the railing, angled perfectly toward the water.</span></p><p><span>Agatha hugged herself against the cool night air. “You live like this and still go back to L.A.? Darling, you’re completely insane.”</span></p><p><span>Rio rested her hands on the railing, looking out at the reflection of the sky. “This place is peace. But peace isn’t easy to keep when people need protecting.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked at her, softer, but didn’t press.</span></p><p><span>Back inside, her stomach growled loud enough to echo. She groaned. “Tell me you have something edible, not just protein powder and despair.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked faintly. “Pantry’s not exactly stocked. We’ll go into town tomorrow, pick up food for the weekend. There’s a little family-owned store, quiet enough no one will notice us.”</span></p><p><span>“So what’s for tonight?”</span></p><p><span>Rio rummaged through a cabinet and pulled down two cans. “Chicken noodle soup. It’s not fancy, but it’ll do.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha gasped dramatically. “Agatha Harkness, eating canned soup like a broke film student. This could ruin me.”</span></p><p><span>“You’ll survive,” Rio deadpanned, tossing her a can opener.</span></p><p><span>Fifteen minutes later, they sat at the small wooden table, steam curling from their bowls. Agatha blew on a spoonful, then sighed with exaggerated bliss. “Mmm. With the right lighting and a few Instagram filters, we could convince the world this is Michelin-star quality.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shook her head, amused despite herself. “Eat your soup.”</span></p><p><span>The only sound for a while was the crackle of the fireplace and the occasional clink of spoons against bowls. It was quiet, almost domestic. For once, there was no press, no stalkers, no chaos, just two women sharing soup in the middle of nowhere.</span></p><p><span>When they’d finished, Rio rinsed their bowls and set them in the sink. “It’s late. You should get some sleep.” She nodded toward one of the guest rooms. “That one’s yours.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha lingered in the doorway, studying her closely. “Thank you. For this. For… everything.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s expression softened, her voice quiet. “Goodnight, Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>“Goodnight, hot stuff,” Agatha whispered, flashing a crooked smile before slipping into the guest room.</span></p><p><span>Rio stood in the kitchen for a long moment after the door closed, exhaling slowly. For years, the cabin had been her solitary retreat. Tonight, for the first time, it felt like it was holding something new.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The next morning, Agatha woke with a smile. It had been a very, very long time since she’d felt true peace, but now she understood exactly what Rio meant when she said she felt drawn here. This place radiated warmth and serenity.</span></p><p><span>She rolled out of bed and dragged herself out of the room, not finding Rio anywhere in the cabin. Just as she was about to knock on Rio’s door, she spotted her through the windows on the back deck.</span></p><p><span>Agatha padded outside, joining Rio quietly. She came up behind her, resting her chin on Rio’s shoulder and wrapping her arms around her.</span></p><p><span>“It’s beautiful out here. So peaceful,” Agatha murmured, pressing a kiss to the curve of Rio’s neck. “You may need to bring me out here more often.”</span></p><p><span>Rio tilted her head slightly, giving Agatha better access, and Agatha smiled into her skin.</span></p><p><span>“We have to run into town to get food for the weekend,” Rio said, her voice soft, but then she hesitated, suddenly looking shy. “And tonight… I was hoping to take you out on a date.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned her head so she could see Rio’s face, smiling warmly. “Hey, don’t get shy on me now. I’m really looking forward to our date, no matter what or where it is. As long as you’re there, I’m happy.”</span></p><p><span>She cupped Rio’s jaw, gently turning her face toward her, and kissed her. Rio melted into the kiss, then turned fully in Agatha’s arms, pulling her closer and deepening it.</span></p><p><span>When they finally pulled away for air, Agatha was breathless, her forehead resting against Rio’s. “Darling,” she said with a smirk, “you keep kissing me like that, we won’t be leaving this cabin all weekend.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s answering smile was equally breathless, but she shook her head and gave Agatha a gentle push back toward the cabin. “Go get ready so we can head out. Like I said last night, the town’s very small, only a couple hundred people. Most come here for retreats or vacations, like me. The likelihood of you being recognized is very, very small.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let herself be nudged inside, still smirking. Fifteen minutes later, she reappeared dressed in black skinny jeans that hugged her figure perfectly, a purple long-sleeved shirt, and her signature navy-blue long coat.</span></p><p><span>Rio was already waiting by the door, keys in hand, dressed simply in dark jeans, boots, and a flannel shirt rolled at the sleeves. It was casual, but on her, it looked unfairly good. Agatha paused for a second longer than she meant to, biting back a smirk at how utterly domestic Rio looked in this environment.</span></p><p><span>“Hot stuff,” Agatha drawled, tugging her coat closed, “if I didn’t know better, I’d say you were auditioning for the lead in some rugged romance novel. Cabin-in-the-woods edition.”</span></p><p><span>Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t hide the flush creeping up her neck. “You’re impossible. Come on—let’s get this over with before you find more ways to make me regret inviting you.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, darling,” Agatha purred as she slid on her sunglasses, “you’d regret not inviting me.”</span></p><p><span>They stepped outside, the crisp morning air carrying the scent of pine and lake water. Rio opened the passenger door for Agatha, who slid in with a little grin at the chivalry, while Rio loaded herself behind the wheel of the black Lexus.</span></p><p><span>The drive into town was winding and beautiful, tall trees arching overhead, sunlight filtering through in soft golden beams. Agatha leaned back in her seat, hand resting comfortably on Rio’s thigh like she belonged there. Rio didn’t say anything, but her fingers drummed once against the steering wheel, betraying just how much she noticed.</span></p><p><span>“So, what’s on the shopping list?” Agatha asked, feigning innocence.</span></p><p><span>“Everything,” Rio answered dryly. “The pantry was one bad storm away from being a disaster. We’ll stock up for the weekend: fresh vegetables, meat, and wine. Maybe even dessert.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha perked up at that. “Wine and dessert? Careful, you’ll spoil me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio flicked her a sidelong glance, lips twitching. “You already are.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha pressed a hand to her chest in mock offense. “Rude! I’ll have you know I am a delight.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed softly, the sound warm in the small space of the car. “That’s one word for it.”</span></p><p><span>As they rounded a bend, the first glimpses of town came into view, a handful of clapboard storefronts, a diner with a red neon sign, and a small general store with baskets of apples and pumpkins set out front. Quaint. Unassuming. The kind of place where no one would expect to see a Hollywood star and her enigmatic bodyguard.</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled slowly, taking it in. “You weren’t kidding. It’s like stepping back in time.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s why I like it,” Rio said, pulling into the small gravel lot. “No one cares who you are here. You’re just another face.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha studied her for a moment, the sincerity in her voice. Then she smiled and slipped her hand into Rio’s as they got out of the car. “Then let’s go be just another couple of faces.”</span></p><p><span>The bell above the general store door jingled as Rio pushed it open, holding it long enough for Agatha to step inside. The shop smelled faintly of cedar and cinnamon, stocked with everything from canned goods to fishing gear. A chalkboard by the counter advertised “Fresh Blueberry Pies – Still Warm!” in messy white script.</span></p><p><span>Agatha slipped off her sunglasses and looked around with a mischievous glint in her eye. “Well, well. A rustic paradise. I feel like we’ve stepped into a Hallmark movie. You’re the broody carpenter, and I’m the city girl who trips over her heels in the produce aisle.”</span></p><p><span>Rio gave her a flat look, but couldn’t suppress the corner of her mouth twitching. “If you trip, I’m not catching you.”</span></p><p><span>“Lies. You’d dive like a knight in flannel armor,” Agatha shot back, already wandering toward the shelves.</span></p><p><span>They started filling a basket with staples—bread, vegetables, and a pack of chicken breasts. Rio snuck in a few things for the dinner she plans to make Agatha tonight without the other women noticing, luckily, she was too busy examining the candy aisle like it's the biggest decision of her life. Agatha tried to sneak in a bag of neon gummy worms, and Rio, without looking, plucked it back out.</span></p><p><span>“No candy,” Rio said simply.</span></p><p><span>“You’re no fun,” Agatha pouted, sliding the gummies back when Rio turned away… only for Rio to snag them again five seconds later.</span></p><p><span>That earned her a full scowl. “Are you a hawk?”</span></p><p><span>“Discipline,” Rio said, unbothered, and moved on to the dairy case.</span></p><p><span>It was when they passed the baking aisle that Agatha stopped dead, gasping theatrically. “Marshmallows. Graham crackers. Chocolate. Hot stuff, are you thinking what I’m thinking?”</span></p><p><span>Rio turned, one brow raised. “S’mores?”</span></p><p><span>“Exactly. A fire, a blanket, stargazing… You, me, sugar high—it’s practically a requirement out here.”</span></p><p><span>Rio sighed but tossed the supplies into the basket. “Fine. But only because I don’t want to hear you whining later.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, you’ll hear me whining,” Agatha smirked, “but not about the s’mores.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nearly dropped the basket, muttering under her breath in Spanish. Agatha cackled, triumphant.</span></p><p><span>By the time they made it to the register, their cart was a jumble of sensible groceries and Agatha’s “essentials” that somehow snuck in—wine, fancy crackers, and two different tubs of ice cream.</span></p><p><span>At checkout, Agatha leaned against the counter. “So. Who carried more groceries? That’s the winner of today’s game.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shook her head, amused. “That’s not even a real competition. I’m carrying the heavy stuff, obviously.”</span></p><p><span>“Unfair advantage!” Agatha protested. “Fine, whoever can carry everything inside the cabin in one trip wins.”</span></p><p><span>“You’ll drop the wine,” Rio said flatly.</span></p><p><span>“Then I’ll drink it off the ground,” Agatha shot back, chin high.</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed, and for a moment, the weight of stalkers, paparazzi, and danger fell away. They were just two women in a sleepy little town, squabbling over groceries like they’d done it a hundred times before.</span></p><p><span>As they loaded the bags into the trunk, Agatha bumped Rio’s hip with her own. “Loser has to make the winner s’mores.”</span></p><p><span>“Deal,” Rio said, smirking. “But don’t say I didn’t warn you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned closer, lowering her voice. “Darling, I never regret losing to you.”</span></p><p><span>And with that, she slid into the passenger seat, leaving Rio to shake her head, cheeks warm despite herself.</span></p><p><span>The drive back to the cabin was filled with bickering about strategy.</span></p><p><span>“You can’t stack the eggs under the soup cans, that’s cheating,” Agatha accused, glaring at Rio’s methodical packing in the trunk.</span></p><p><span>“It’s called balance,” Rio countered. “Physics, not cheating.”</span></p><p><span>“Physics, my ass. If you break my wine, you’re sleeping outside.”</span></p><p><span>When they finally pulled up to the cabin, Agatha hopped out like she was gearing up for battle. She yanked her sunglasses off, squared her shoulders, and declared, “Alright, rules are simple: one trip, no dropping, no help. Winner gets spoiled with s’mores.”</span></p><p><span>Rio just smirked and started looping grocery bags up her arms with the precision of a soldier loading gear. Agatha, determined, mirrored her, though her method looked more like she was trying to wrangle a pack of angry cats.</span></p><p><span>They made it halfway up the path before Agatha’s strategy began to unravel. A bag of marshmallows nearly slipped, and in her scramble to catch it, she almost toppled sideways into the bushes.</span></p><p><span>“Need help?” Rio asked sweetly, not even winded.</span></p><p><span>“Shut up,” Agatha hissed through gritted teeth, wobbling forward with heroic determination.</span></p><p><span>By the time they staggered onto the porch, Rio was perfectly composed, setting her bags down neatly by the door. Agatha stumbled up a second later, sweaty and red-faced, but triumphantly dropped her pile of groceries beside Rio’s.</span></p><p><span>“See? Did it. No losses.”</span></p><p><span>“You look like you just fought in a war,” Rio teased, reaching over to tug a leaf out of Agatha’s hair. “But I’ll admit, you earned it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha beamed, chest heaving. “So… who wins?”</span></p><p><span>Rio tilted her head. “You didn’t drop anything. Neither did I. Tie?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned closer, smirking. “Darling, ties mean we both get s’mores.”</span></p><p><span>Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “Convenient logic, but… fine. Both get s’mores.”</span></p><p><span>They carried the groceries inside, Rio still effortlessly, Agatha with dramatic groans, and unloaded them onto the counter. For the first time in what felt like forever, the cabin felt alive: food on the shelves, laughter bouncing off the walls, the kind of lighthearted chaos neither of them realized how much they needed.</span></p><p><span>Agatha collapsed into a chair, fanning herself with a box of graham crackers. “You know, if this whole bodyguarding thing doesn’t work out, you could win strongwoman competitions. Just saying.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked, leaning on the counter. “And you’d be in the front row heckling.”</span></p><p><span>“Obviously.”</span></p><p><span>They shared a smile—quiet, warm, a moment that felt like home.</span></p><p><span>“Okay, you go to the living room and entertain yourself. I’m going to get our date ready, and no peeking. I’ll come get you when it’s done.” Rio’s tone was firm, but the faint blush on her cheeks betrayed her nerves. She gave Agatha a gentle push toward the living room.</span></p><p><span>Agatha went willingly, her grin wide and mischievous. “Bossy. I like it,” she teased, though she caught the quick roll of Rio’s eyes before the soldier disappeared.</span></p><p><span>A moment later, the blinds in the living room clicked shut one by one, Rio’s tall figure moving with purposeful efficiency. Then came the sound of the back door closing softly, the latch clicking in a way that made it clear: stay put.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sighed dramatically and flopped onto the couch. She grabbed the remote and began flipping through channels, cycling past cooking shows, nature documentaries, and late-night reruns until she landed on a corny action flick; explosions, bad one-liners, and all. Within minutes, she was curled up, muttering commentary under her breath, completely absorbed despite herself.</span></p><p><span>Every so often, her gaze drifted toward the window blinds, her mind tugged back to Rio. What was she doing out there? Building something? Setting something up? Agatha smirked to herself, warmth blooming in her chest. It had taken weeks of relentless flirting, innuendo, and shameless persistence, but finally, finally, she’d gotten the stoic bodyguard to break. And now here she was—Rio Vidal, ex-Delta Force, consummate professional—planning her a surprise date.</span></p><p><span>Agatha chuckled to herself, eyes still on the flickering TV. She wouldn’t trade this for anything.</span></p><p><span>Agatha nearly jumped when Rio’s voice came from behind her.</span></p><p><span>“Alright, </span><em><span>carino.</span></em><span> It’s ready.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha spun on the couch, the action movie forgotten, her eyes sparkling with mischief and curiosity. “Finally! You’ve kept me prisoner in here long enough. What have you been doing, building me a castle?”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked, shaking her head. “Not quite. Come on.” She held out her hand.</span></p><p><span>Agatha slipped her palm into hers, and the warmth of Rio’s calloused hand alone was enough to make her heart skip. They stepped outside into the crisp Massachusetts night, the air scented with pine and cool lake water. Rio led her down a narrow path lit softly with lanterns she’d strung along the way, their glow casting golden halos in the darkness.</span></p><p><span>They walked a short distance until the trees opened into a clearing by the lakeshore—and Agatha froze.</span></p><p><span>Set against the mirror-like water was a large outdoor movie screen, the kind you’d expect at a drive-in theater. A projector flickered to life behind them, waiting for its cue. In front of the screen, nestled on the grass, was a large air mattress piled with thick blankets and pillows that looked almost scandalously inviting. To the right, on the sand, a fire pit crackled low, casting sparks into the night. Around it were a few logs pulled up for seating, a tray of marshmallows, chocolate, and graham crackers already waiting. And off to the side, near a small folding table, was a bottle of wine chilling in an ice bucket beside Agatha’s favorite meal, already plated and steaming as if it had just been served at a restaurant.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s mouth actually dropped open. “Rio…” Her voice faltered, something rare for her. She let out a breathless laugh, taking it all in. “Darling, you’ve outdone yourself. This is… </span><em><span>insane.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>Rio shifted a little awkwardly, one hand rubbing the back of her neck. “I wanted something special. You’ve had too much chaos lately. You deserve a night that’s just…” She gestured to the lake, the fire, the setup. “This.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned, eyes wide and soft in a way Rio wasn’t used to seeing. “Hot stuff, if you were trying to impress me, congratulations. You’ve succeeded. You may now collect your prize.” She tugged Rio closer by the front of her flannel, planting a playful kiss on her lips before pulling back with a smirk.</span></p><p><span>Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “Come on. Dinner first.”</span></p><p><span>They settled on the mattress, blankets draped around their shoulders like a cocoon. Rio handed over a plate of extra-cheesy truffle Mac and Cheese with roasted brussels sprouts with balsamic glaze—Agatha’s favorite comfort dish—and poured them both glasses of wine.</span></p><p><span>Agatha twirled her fork, taking her first bite with an exaggerated moan. “Sweet merciful gods… You’re not just a soldier and a bodyguard, but a five-star chef as well. I knew you could cook, but damn, this is the best thing I’ve ever tasted. I really am going to have to marry you, Vidal.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nearly choked on her wine, coughing as Agatha laughed so hard she had to put her fork down.</span></p><p><span>“You can’t just—” Rio wheezed, still coughing. “You can’t just throw that out casually.”</span></p><p><span>“Why not? It’s true!” Agatha teased, sipping her wine with mock sophistication. “I like my women dangerous, tattooed, and capable of making me dinner. You tick all the boxes.”</span></p><p><span>Rio rolled her eyes, but there was no hiding the fond smile tugging at her lips.</span></p><p><span>Dinner stretched into an easy rhythm of laughter, teasing, and stories. Agatha regaled Rio with tales of disastrous early auditions, including one where she was cast as a background tree. Rio countered with a deployment story involving a goat that had wandered into their camp and refused to leave until they started feeding it their rations.</span></p><p><span>When the plates were cleared, they moved to the fire pit. Rio skewered a marshmallow with military precision, holding it just above the flames. Agatha, on the other hand, shoved hers directly into the fire, watching gleefully as it erupted into flames.</span></p><p><span>“That’s barbaric,” Rio deadpanned.</span></p><p><span>“That’s delicious,” Agatha corrected, blowing out the charred marshmallow and popping it into her mouth with a hum of delight.</span></p><p><span>Rio shook her head, but the corner of her mouth twitched. “You’re incorrigible.”</span></p><p><span>“And you love it,” Agatha shot back.</span></p><p><span>They built s’mores, chocolate melting into gooey perfection, and sat shoulder to shoulder by the fire. Agatha tipped her head onto Rio’s shoulder, wineglass dangling from her hand. For once, her voice softened, free of bravado.</span></p><p><span>“You know… no one’s ever done something like this for me. Not really. People have given me expensive gifts, whisked me off to parties or trips, but…” She gestured toward the fire, the lake, the blankets. “This feels different. Real.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s gaze softened. She reached over, tucking a stray lock of Agatha’s hair behind her ear. “That’s because it is. I don’t want to give you things. I want to give you peace.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s breath caught. She shifted so she could look directly into Rio’s eyes, the firelight painting her features in gold. “Careful, Vidal. You keep saying things like that, and I might fall for you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned in, lips ghosting over hers. “Maybe that’s the point.”</span></p><p><span>The kiss that followed was slow, deep, and unhurried, like the world had narrowed to just them and the crackle of the fire.</span></p><p><span>When they finally pulled apart, Agatha chuckled, brushing her thumb along Rio’s jaw. “Darling, between the wine, the s’mores, and that kiss, I don’t think I’m ever leaving this cabin.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled, pressing a kiss to her temple. “Then the mission’s already a success.”</span></p><p><span>They sank back into the mattress together, the movie, The Devil Wears Prada, Agatha’s favorite film, flickered to life on the screen, forgotten almost as soon as it started. Wrapped in blankets, warmed by firelight and laughter, they let themselves simply </span><em><span>be</span></em><span>—two women finding something tender and true in the quiet heart of the woods.</span></p>

<p><span>The two spent the rest of the movie wrapped in warmth, laughing, teasing, and talking about anything and everything. The world outside didn’t exist; there was only them.</span></p><p><span>“Hey, cariño,” Rio said at last, her voice softer than the flickering film light around them. “Can I ask you something?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned her head, studying her carefully. “Of course, darling. Ask me anything you wish.”</span></p><p><span>Rio hesitated, nerves flickering in her usually steady eyes. “This is serious for you, right? You don’t… want to see other people? You want to be mine, and only mine?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s lips curved into the faintest smile, but her eyes were full of sincerity. “Yes, Rio. I think I’ve been yours since the moment our eyes met in that conference room. I don’t know how to explain it, but it felt like my body and my soul already knew you. When our eyes locked for the first time, my heart fluttered, and for the first time in my life, my soul rested. And you’ve noticed, haven’t you? For a so-called serial womanizer, I haven’t taken a single other woman to bed, or even tried, since I met you.”</span></p><p><span>Her words hung in the air, heavy with honesty.</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded slowly, her throat tight. “And I want you to know it’s the same for me. I know I fought it, pushed it away, but that was because of two things. First, my professionalism. And second, because of how much I felt for you, even in such a short time. It scared me, Agatha. Still does.”</span></p><p><span>She drew in a breath, her voice dipping lower, more vulnerable than Agatha had ever heard. “I know we both carry scars from past loves. But I want us to try, really try to create something new, together. I may not be ready to go public yet, but please know this: I care for you. Stronger than I ever have for anyone, even Valkyrie. And admitting that terrifies me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked at her, stunned by the weight of the admission. For once, she didn’t have a quip, no flirtatious remark to dodge the intensity. Instead, she reached out, cradling Rio’s face between her hands, forcing her to meet her gaze.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, sweetheart,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “You have no idea how much that means to me. I know how much Valkyrie meant to you, and for you to say that… to trust me with that truth…” Her thumb brushed gently across Rio’s cheekbone, soft and reverent. “I won’t take it lightly. I won’t take you lightly.”</span></p><p><span>Rio swallowed hard, eyes glistening.</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned in, pressing her forehead against Rio’s. “You terrify me, too, darling. Because for the first time, I actually want forever. With you.”</span></p><p><span>For a long, breathless moment, they stayed there, holding each other in silence as the lake shimmered in the distance and the fire crackled softly, sealing promises neither of them had dared to make before.</span></p><p><span>“Will you be my girlfriend, cariño?” Rio whispered, her voice barely more than a breath against Agatha’s lips.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s smile broke wide and bright, laughter bubbling out of her like champagne. “Yes, a thousand times yes. Took you long enough to ask me.”</span></p><p><span>Before Rio could say another word, Agatha closed the gap, kissing her like her life depended on it, like she’d been waiting her whole life for this exact moment.</span></p><p><span>Rio kissed her back with a ferocity that left no space between them. She shifted, straddling Agatha, kissing her like it was the only thing in the world that mattered. When she broke away, it was only to trail her lips along Agatha’s jaw and down her neck.</span></p><p><span>Agatha moaned softly, tilting her head to give her more access, her fingers threading through Rio’s hair to hold her close. </span></p><p><span>“I’m going to fuck you so hard, you will forget all the past women you’ve fucked,” Rio’s breath was hot against her ear, her voice a low growl that sent a shiver racing down Agatha’s spine.</span></p><p><span>“Fuck, let’s take this inside,” Agatha whispered, her voice trembling with need.</span></p><p><span>In one smooth motion, Rio stood and lifted her effortlessly, Agatha’s legs wrapping around her waist. Their mouths crashed together again, desperate and unrestrained, both unwilling to let go. Every few steps back to the cabin, Rio stopped, pressing Agatha against a tree, kissing her harder, as though the world itself might split apart if she didn’t.</span></p><p><span>By the time they reached Rio’s door, neither was thinking clearly, only of each other. Rio kicked it closed behind them, pinning Agatha against it, their kisses deeper, hungrier, the air between them electric and undeniable.</span></p><p><span>Rio got to work, stripping Agatha of her shirt with practiced ease before expertly sliding off her black lace bra.</span></p><p><span>“Were you planning on me fucking you tonight, hermosa?” Rio asked breathlessly, cupping one of Agatha’s breasts and bringing it to her mouth.</span></p><p><span>“I have been hoping you would fuck me at some point,” Agatha managed, her words breaking as her head fell back against the door, a loud moan escaping her.</span></p><p><span>Rio latched onto her nipple, tongue and lips working hungrily while her free hand palmed the other breast. She twisted the sensitive peak just enough to make Agatha cry out in pleasure.</span></p><p><span>“Oh fuck—just like that!” Agatha pleaded.</span></p><p><span>Rio obeyed, harsher this time, sucking hard on her nipple until Agatha was trembling beneath her touch.</span></p><p><span>“Such a good girl, so responsive for me. Are you wet for me, darling?” Rio whispered against her ear.</span></p><p><span>Instead of answering, Agatha seized Rio’s hand and shoved it down the waistband of her pants and underwear. The sudden wet heat nearly undid Rio, making her groan low in her chest.</span></p><p><span>“You are soaked, darling. Is this all for me?” she asked, fingers sliding through Agatha’s slick folds, teasing everywhere but where she craved most.</span></p><p><span>“Yes, all for you, baby, please just touch me,” Agatha begged, locking eyes with her. Her pupils were blown wide, her breath ragged, every inch of her body straining toward Rio.</span></p><p><span>Rio loomed over Agatha, her gaze sharp and unreadable, drinking her in as if she were the only thing that existed. For a moment, neither of them moved, the air thick with the weight of anticipation, Agatha’s breath shallow, Rio’s chest rising and falling like she was trying to restrain herself.</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked faintly, though her body trembled under Rio’s grip. “You’re staring at me like you’re about to devour me,” she teased, voice low and wavering.</span></p><p><span>“Maybe I am,” Rio replied, her tone dark but reverent. “You don’t know how long I’ve waited for this.” She dragged her thumb slowly across Agatha’s lower lip before leaning down to kiss her again—firmer this time, lips demanding, then softening into something almost worshipful.</span></p><p><span>When she finally pulled back, she whispered, “Tell me if you wish to stop at any time, </span><em><span>mi vida.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes fluttered open, locking with hers. “I will, darling. Now, please just fuck me.”</span></p><p><span>A sharp exhale escaped Rio, her restraint fraying. She brushed a strand of hair from Agatha’s face, her touch gentle despite the fire in her eyes. “First, I want to taste you. I have dreamt of what you would taste like for many years.” Her voice cracked with reverence, pupils blown wide.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s lips curved in a sly grin as her eyes flicked down Rio’s still-clothed body. “You’re overdressed, </span><em><span>amor.</span></em><span>” She started to rise, reaching for Rio’s shirt, but Rio caught her wrists with lightning speed, pinning them against the headboard.</span></p><p><span>Agatha moaned at the sudden display of dominance, her body arching.</span></p><p><span>“You like it when I’m rough with you, don’t you, darling?” Rio’s tone was teasing, sharp, as she leaned close enough for her breath to brush Agatha’s ear. </span></p><p><span>Agatha could only answer with another loud moan, twisting beneath her. She tried to lift her hips for contact, but Rio easily pressed her back down with the weight of her palm against her lower stomach.</span></p><p><span>“Impatient little thing,” Rio murmured, her voice dripping with amusement.</span></p><p><span>“Please, Rio,” Agatha gasped, her tone breaking.</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked at the plea and shifted back, keeping her dominance unshaken. “You will take what I give you,” she commanded, every word carrying steel. In one swift motion, she hooked her fingers into Agatha’s pants and underwear—black lace to match the bra she’d stripped away earlier, and ripped them off in a single, decisive tug, flinging them aside without hesitation.</span></p><p><span>Her eyes returned to Agatha’s, smoldering with both hunger and control. “Mine,” she whispered, the word more a vow than a claim.</span></p><p><span>Rio seized Agatha by the waist and dragged her toward the edge of the bed, her movements swift and commanding. Dropping to her knees without hesitation, she gave no buildup, no warning—only raw intention—before diving in. The sudden contact made Agatha cry out, her back arching as pleasure ripped through her.</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned against her, the vibration sending another jolt through Agatha’s body. Fingers tangled in Rio’s dark hair, Agatha pulled her closer, desperate, clinging as if she couldn’t bear even an inch of distance.</span></p><p><span>“Just like that, oh fuck—don’t stop!” Agatha screamed, her voice breaking as her head thudded back against the bed. Her hips lifted urgently, chasing every flick and pull of Rio’s mouth.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes flicked upward through her lashes, watching Agatha unravel beneath her touch. Her technique shifted seamlessly, quick flicks of her tongue melting into harsher, possessive sucks that drew cries from deep in Agatha’s chest. Agatha’s hips rolled and ground against her, each movement more frantic, more needy.</span></p><p><span>“So good, fuck me, you are so good at that, baby,” Agatha panted, breathless.</span></p><p><span>A smile curved against Rio’s lips at the praise. She slid two fingers to gently part Agatha, exposing her further, before attacking with sharper precision. The rougher flick against her clit tore a scream from Agatha, her body jolting off the bed, only to be pressed back down by the strength of Rio’s arms holding her steady.</span></p><p><span>Then, just as Agatha was about to beg for more, Rio pulled back. The protest barely left her lips before she gasped, her body filled suddenly, two fingers sliding into her with deliberate force.</span></p><p><span>“Such a good girl for me,” Rio purred, her voice husky with control. “Are you going to cum, </span><em><span>mi vida?</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>“Yes! yes, Daddy!” Agatha screamed, the word slipping free before she even realized.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s head snapped up, eyes locking on hers with sudden fire. Surprise flickered across her features for only a second before it melted into something darker, hungrier. She hadn’t expected it, hadn’t even thought of it. But Agatha had just revealed more than either of them anticipated.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s pace grew harsher, driving into Agatha with unrelenting force. Each thrust of her fingers curved just right, striking the spot that made Agatha jolt and cry out, her body trembling with every movement.</span></p><p><span>“More! Please, baby, more!” Agatha begged, her voice ragged. She had always been the one in control in bed, but now—pinned, undone, commanded—she found herself craving submission more than she could admit.</span></p><p><span>“Call me Daddy again, baby, and I will give you whatever you want,” Rio growled, her words both promise and demand.</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked, startled for a split second, before a sly recognition curved her lips into a smirk. “You like it when I call you Daddy, baby?” she teased, her breath breaking into gasps as Rio’s fingers continued their ruthless rhythm.</span></p><p><span>Rio answered only with a low, primal growl, thrusting harder, filling her completely. “Don’t test me, darling,” she warned, her tone thick with restraint.</span></p><p><span>“Fuck, Daddy, just like that. Fuck me harder, Daddy. I can take it!” Agatha moaned, her back arching clean off the bed. The pleasure was unlike anything she had ever known, more consuming, more devastating. Rio seemed to read her body like a map, giving her everything she needed without hesitation.</span></p><p><span>Lowering again, Rio sealed her mouth over Agatha’s clit, sucking with punishing intensity as she added another finger, her rhythm merciless. She alternated between rough thrusts and harsh pulls of her mouth until Agatha was crying out her name again and again, her voice breaking as release overtook her.</span></p><p><span>“You’re mine when you cum for me, do you hear me?” Rio muttered against her.</span></p><p><span>“Yes!! Yes, baby, I’m yours!” Agatha screamed, her words tumbling out unbidden as she shattered, writhing as her climax ripped through her.</span></p><p><span>Rio held her firmly, drinking in every last tremor, licking her clean with hungry reverence. Only when Agatha was left boneless on the bed did Rio slowly rise, sliding her way back up to claim her lips.</span></p><p><span>The kiss was deep, consuming, Agatha groaning into it as she tasted herself on Rio’s tongue. When Rio finally pulled away, her voice was dark velvet.</span></p><p><span>“I’m not done with you yet, darling.”</span></p><p><span>A weak laugh escaped Agatha, breathless and wrecked. “I don’t think I can survive round two.”</span></p><p><span>“You’ll survive,” Rio smirked, brushing her lips across Agatha’s cheek. “You’ll beg me for it.”</span></p><p><span>She stood, commanding Agatha with a gesture to move further up the bed. Still groggy and weak from her mind-blowing release, Agatha obeyed, dragging herself upward while never breaking eye contact with her bodyguard.</span></p><p><span>Rio began to unbutton her plaid shirt, deliberately slow, savoring the hunger in Agatha’s gaze. One button at a time, teasingly undone, until at last she stripped it away and tossed it aside without care. Her bra followed, the garment slipping to the floor as her bare skin came into view.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s breath hitched. She swallowed hard, her eyes devouring every inch of Rio—the sculpted ridges of her abs, the sweep of tattoos carved across her skin like stories she longed to trace with her tongue. Her lips parted unconsciously, a flick of her tongue wetting them as her hunger grew. The night was young, and she intended to taste every inch of her.</span></p><p><span>“Do you like what you see, darling?” Rio asked knowingly, her smirk widening.</span></p><p><span>Agatha licked her lips, voice low and hoarse. “You already know the answer to that.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hands dropped to the button of her jeans, sliding the zipper down with agonizing slowness. She dragged the denim over her hips, each movement deliberate, aware of the awe in Agatha’s eyes. When the jeans hit the floor, she stood tall, clad only in her underwear.</span></p><p><span>Agatha could only stare, wide-eyed and unashamed, drinking her in. Rio was beautiful in a way that felt almost impossible, her arms strong, her stomach defined, her thighs powerful. To Agatha, it was as if she were gazing upon something beyond mortal, a cosmic entity, maybe even death herself, because her heart nearly stopped the moment Rio began sliding her underwear down as well.</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked, standing unabashedly in her full power as Agatha’s hungry gaze swept across her body. The actress made no attempt to hide her awe, openly staring, her lips parted, her chest rising in uneven breaths.</span></p><p><span>“Careful, </span><em><span>mi vida,</span></em><span>” Rio said, her tone soft but commanding. “If you look at me like that much longer, I might forget to go easy on you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked weakly, though her voice trembled. “Who said I wanted you to go easy?”</span></p><p><span>“You may regret saying that, </span><em><span>cariño,</span></em><span>” Rio chuckled darkly, her voice low and rich with promise. She opened her nightstand and pulled out a harness fitted with a thick strap-on—seven inches long, green in color, with a solid girth.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes widened, a gasp leaving her lips. For a moment, nerves flickered across her features, but her hunger quickly returned, pupils blown as she bit her lip. She couldn’t help but stare, her body aching at the thought of Rio using it on her.</span></p><p><span>“I haven’t taken something that big in a while, Daddy,” Agatha admitted, her voice trembling slightly, the edge of nerves softening her bravado.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s expression softened immediately. After slipping into the harness, she climbed onto the bed, her movements slower, more deliberate. She leaned down, cupping Agatha’s cheek and kissing her gently. “I’ll be gentle at first, baby, don’t worry. And if it gets to be too much, just tell me.” Her words were soft, protective, an anchor beneath the storm of desire.</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded, reassured, whispering against Rio’s lips, “I trust you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled faintly before sitting back. She grabbed lube and slicked the toy slowly, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s. The moment was so intense it felt electric. Her groan slipped out as her hand moved, almost involuntarily.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tilted her head, voice curious, innocent. “Can you feel it, darling?”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s breath hitched, her cheeks flushed. “It’s rubbing against my clit, baby,” she admitted, her voice husky.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s lips parted, her moan soft but desperate. “So when you fuck me, you’ll feel every thrust as well, Daddy?”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes fluttered shut for a moment as another groan escaped her. “Yes, baby. Every single one.”</span></p><p><span>She crawled higher up the bed, positioning herself between Agatha’s spread thighs. Agatha welcomed her eagerly, legs opening like an offering, gaze locked on Rio with a hunger that burned.</span></p><p><span>Rio dragged the toy through her folds, coating it with the wetness that still lingered. Agatha whimpered at the contact, her hips shifting restlessly. Slowly, deliberately, Rio pressed in, an inch at a time before pulling back, repeating the motion, going deeper with every pass.</span></p><p><span>“I’m ready, Daddy. Please fuck me with your cock,” Agatha begged, desperation lacing her tone.</span></p><p><span>“Beg louder, baby. I can’t hear you,” Rio ordered, though her voice cracked with restraint. Her own body was strung tight, trembling with the effort it took not to slam into her wildly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha broke. “PLEASE, DADDY! Please put your cock in me. Fuck a baby into me, please! I need it so bad. I’ll be good, I promise!”</span></p><p><span>That shattered what little control Rio had left. She pulled out completely, then slammed all the way in with a single, brutal thrust. Agatha screamed, her whole body arching and writhing as pleasure consumed her.</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned loudly, the pressure of the harness against her clit sending shockwaves through her own body. She leaned forward, never slowing, sucking a nipple into her mouth while her hips drove relentlessly. Her tongue flicked, her teeth grazed, and then she moved to the other breast with the same hungry attention before biting and kissing her way up Agatha’s neck. She left marks as she went, hidden, tucked away where no camera would ever find them, but where Rio would always know.</span></p><p><span>“You feel so fucking good wrapped around my cock, baby,” Rio growled into her ear, her words rough, primal.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s voice broke in another moan. “Fuck me from behind, Daddy. Spank me, pull my hair, and choke me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio faltered for half a beat, her thrusts stuttering as she stared at Agatha in surprise. She’d known Agatha liked it rough, but hearing it, hearing her beg for it made her even wetter, her control slipping further.</span></p><p><span>“Are you sure, darling?” she asked, her tone darker now, but still carrying the thread of care.</span></p><p><span>“Yes,” Agatha gasped, eyes wild. “Please.”</span></p><p><span>That was all Rio needed. She pulled out, flipped Agatha effortlessly onto her stomach, and forced her onto her hands and knees. She gripped her hips and thrust back in hard, this time not holding back.</span></p><p><span>Her rhythm was brutal, each thrust deeper, harder, rougher than the last. One arm snaked around Agatha’s throat, pulling her back until her spine pressed against Rio’s front. At this new angle, the cock slammed deeper, striking places Agatha didn’t know existed, while the pressure against Rio’s clit grew unbearable.</span></p><p><span>Agatha came again, screaming, but Rio didn’t stop. She pressed her back down against the bed, her thrusts merciless. With every stroke, her hand came down sharply on Agatha’s ass, the sound echoing in the room.</span></p><p><span>Agatha cried out, the mix of pain and pleasure overwhelming her. She tried to crawl forward, her body shaking from release, but Rio dragged her back with a growl.</span></p><p><span>“You can take one more, darling. I know you can,” Rio murmured in her ear, her voice both a command and an invitation. “But if you want me to stop, you only have to say so.”</span></p><p><span>“No, I can take it, Daddy,” Agatha panted, her body trembling, skin slick with sweat. She was completely undone, but the fire in her eyes told Rio she meant every word.</span></p><p><span>That was all the permission Rio needed. With a guttural sound in her throat, she drove back into her, primal in her rhythm, every thrust fueled by raw need. She had never been this rough, never let herself lose control like this, but with Agatha, it was different. With Agatha she didn’t want restraint.</span></p><p><span>The bed shook beneath them, their moans filling the room until they were almost indistinguishable from one another. Agatha’s voice broke in pleading gasps, Rio’s groans grew heavier, and then, like a tide crashing all at once, both stuttered, both breaking apart at the same time, cumming hard together.</span></p><p><span>Rio collapsed beside Agatha, chest heaving, her body spent. The harness dug into her hips uncomfortably, and she tore it off with little care, tossing it aside onto the floor to be dealt with tomorrow. For now, she wanted nothing but the warmth pressed against her.</span></p><p><span>Still catching her breath, she reached to her nightstand, pulling out a pack of wipes. Quietly, almost tenderly, she cleaned them both—sliding the cloth over her own thighs and then carefully between Agatha’s legs. She lingered on Agatha’s skin with reverence, wiping away sweat and slick with the gentleness of someone who wanted her partner comfortable above all else.</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a small sigh of contentment and curled into Rio’s side, nuzzling against her chest. Rio instinctively wrapped her arms around her, pressing a soft kiss to her damp forehead.</span></p><p><span>“I wasn’t too rough, was I, </span><em><span>mi vida</span></em><span>?” Rio asked, her voice suddenly shy, uncertainty creeping in after the storm had passed.</span></p><p><span>Agatha chuckled tiredly, shaking her head against Rio’s skin. “Darling, that was the best fuck I’ve ever had in my life. You knew exactly what I wanted without me even asking. I didn’t know you had that side in you, but gods, I’m so glad you do. It was so fucking hot.”</span></p><p><span>Relief flooded Rio, her tense shoulders easing as she let out a soft breath. She smiled faintly, brushing a strand of hair from Agatha’s face. “Get some rest, </span><em><span>cariño,</span></em><span>” she murmured, kissing her softly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes were already half-closed as she mumbled, “I owe you a few orgasms. Don’t think I’ll forget.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed quietly, her chest tightening with fondness. She watched Agatha drift off, a soft smile curving her lips. Within moments, she followed, slipping into sleep with the woman she never thought she’d find pressed safely against her side.</span></p><p><span>Morning light spilled faintly through the curtains, painting soft gold across the tangled sheets. Rio stirred first, blinking against the glow. Her body ached in the best way, muscles humming from the night before. She turned her head slightly to find Agatha sprawled against her chest, hair messy, lips parted, still deep in sleep.</span></p><p><span>For a long moment, Rio just watched her. The usually sharp, guarded actress looked so peaceful like this, unguarded, vulnerable, safe. It made something warm and dangerous stir in Rio’s chest. She brushed a strand of hair from Agatha’s face and pressed a feather-light kiss to her temple.</span></p><p><span>“Mmm,” Agatha groaned, eyes fluttering open. Her voice was rough with sleep. “You’re staring at me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked. “Can you blame me?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha cracked a crooked smile, stretching languidly like a cat. “No, but I was hoping for breakfast in bed after the way you wrecked me last night.”</span></p><p><span>Rio chuckled, brushing her thumb along Agatha’s jaw. “I can cook, </span><em><span>cariño.</span></em><span> But don’t expect anything fancy given what we got in our pantry.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha rolled onto her side to look at her, eyes glittering with amusement despite her exhaustion. “Oh, I don’t care if it’s burnt toast and bitter coffee. After last night, you could hand me cereal in a dog bowl and I’d thank you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio barked a laugh, shaking her head. “You’re ridiculous.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m serious,” Agatha said, propping her head on her hand. Her expression softened then, sincerity slipping through the teasing. “You took care of me. Not just during, but after. That means more than you think.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s chest tightened. She wasn’t used to hearing things like that, and she covered it with a shrug. “I told you, I’d never hurt you. Not for real.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha reached over and traced the edge of one of Rio’s tattoos with her fingertip. “I know. That’s why I let go with you.”</span></p><p><span>Silence lingered, comfortable, before Agatha’s smirk returned. “Also, I distinctly remember promising you I’d make up for a few orgasms I owe you. And I’m a woman of my word.”</span></p><p><span>Rio raised an eyebrow, amused. “You can barely keep your eyes open.”</span></p><p><span>“Details,” Agatha yawned, then burrowed back against Rio’s chest with a dramatic sigh. “Fine. Later. But don’t you dare let me off the hook.”</span></p><p><span>Rio chuckled, kissing the top of her head. “Trust me, </span><em><span>mi vida,</span></em><span> I won’t.”</span></p><p><span>They lay there in silence, the kind that spoke louder than words—two women who had spent the night tearing each other apart and now found themselves stitched closer together.</span></p><p><span>For the first time in a long time, Rio let herself relax, her guard lowered. She wasn’t just protecting Agatha anymore. She was falling for her.</span></p><p><span>By midmorning, the cabin smelled faintly of coffee and frying eggs. Agatha padded into the kitchen barefoot, hair still messy but eyes bright. Rio was at the stove in flannel and sweatpants, sleeves rolled up, spatula in hand.</span></p><p><span>“Now this is domestic bliss,” Agatha declared, leaning against the doorway. “The badass, special forces bodyguard who could kill a man with her pinky finger, making me scrambled eggs.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shot her a look over her shoulder. “Keep talking and you’ll be eating them off the floor.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha gasped dramatically. “Threats before breakfast? You’re cruel.”</span></p><p><span>But she came up behind Rio anyway, sliding her arms around her waist and resting her chin on her shoulder. “Smells amazing. You’re already dangerously close to becoming my favorite person.”</span></p><p><span>“Already?” Rio muttered, but the pink creeping up her neck gave her away.</span></p><p><span>After breakfast, Rio suggested a hike around the lake. The path was shaded, winding through pine and birch, sunlight streaming through the branches in golden stripes. Agatha, in her designer jeans and sunglasses, looked far more like someone about to step onto a magazine cover than into the woods, but she kept up without complaint.</span></p><p><span>“Admit it,” she said as they climbed a small rise. “You brought me here to test if I can survive outside of Hollywood luxuries.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked. “Maybe. And so far, you’re passing.”</span></p><p><span>“Of course I am,” Agatha sniffed. “I’m excellent at pretending.”</span></p><p><span>They reached a rocky outcrop overlooking the lake, glittering under the sun. Rio watched as Agatha fell quiet, genuinely soaking it in.</span></p><p><span>“It’s beautiful,” Agatha murmured. “You were right. I get why you built your life here.”</span></p><p><span>“Not my life,” Rio corrected gently. “Just a place to breathe.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hand found hers, fingers lacing together. “Then I’m glad you let me breathe with you.”</span></p><p><span>Later that afternoon, Rio insisted on teaching Agatha to fish. That lasted all of five minutes.</span></p><p><span>“You want me to put a </span><em><span>worm</span></em><span> on that hook?” Agatha exclaimed, holding the bait between two fingers like it was toxic waste.</span></p><p><span>Rio nearly doubled over laughing. “It’s not going to bite you.”</span></p><p><span>“Easy for you to say, you’re terrifying. I’m delicate!” Agatha protested, though she was smirking as she said it.</span></p><p><span>“Delicate,” Rio repeated flatly, still laughing.</span></p><p><span>Agatha huffed, dropping the worm with a yelp when it wriggled. “Nope. Absolutely not. I’m retiring from fishing. Permanently.”</span></p><p><span>Rio reeled her in with an arm around her waist, still laughing. “Fine, </span><em><span>Hermosa.</span></em><span> We’ll stick to s’mores and wine. That’s more your speed anyway.”</span></p><p><span>By late afternoon, the sun was warm enough to coax them into the lake. Agatha waded in first, squealing when the cold water hit her legs.</span></p><p><span>“Darling, this is </span><em><span>freezing!</span></em><span>” she cried, splashing water at Rio.</span></p><p><span>Big mistake.</span></p><p><span>Rio arched a brow, then charged. Agatha shrieked and tried to run, but the water slowed her down. Rio caught her easily, scooping her up over her shoulder.</span></p><p><span>“No, no, no—Rio!” Agatha kicked, laughing hysterically. “Don’t you dare!”</span></p><p><span>Rio tossed her straight into the lake with a splash.</span></p><p><span>Agatha surfaced, sputtering and laughing. “You’re evil!”</span></p><p><span>“You started it,” Rio said smugly, treading water.</span></p><p><span>Agatha splashed her with both hands, sending water straight into Rio’s face. “And I’ll finish it!”</span></p><p><span>They chased each other across the water, shrieking, splashing, dunking. It was childish, ridiculous, and perfect. By the time they dragged themselves back onto the shore, both were breathless with laughter, dripping wet, hair plastered to their faces.</span></p><p><span>Agatha collapsed onto the grass beside Rio, still laughing. “I haven’t had that much fun in years.”</span></p><p><span>Rio turned her head to look at her, chest still heaving from laughter. “Me either.”</span></p><p><span>And then Agatha leaned over and kissed her—salty, messy, still damp from the lake, and Rio kissed back like there was no one else in the world.</span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><span>The rest of the weekend unfolded in much the same way. Agatha gave the orgasms she promised to Rio with her mouth and fingers, and she even rode Rio’s face and abs. They cooked simple meals together, walked the trails, lay under blankets by the fire, watching movies projected on the lakeshore. Agatha teased relentlessly, but Rio, who once stiffened at every flirtation, now gave it back in shy, careful doses, her confidence growing each time.</span></p><p><span>At night, they curled up together in Rio’s bed, sometimes talking until dawn, sometimes letting silence say everything. Agatha never thought she’d find peace in the quiet, but with Rio, she did.</span></p><p><span>And Rio, who had sworn never to let her guard down again, found herself wanting to hold onto this, for as long as life would let her.</span></p><p><span>Sunday evening came too quickly.</span></p><p><span>The cabin was quiet as Agatha folded the last of her clothes into her suitcase. Outside, the lake caught the last glow of the setting sun, the water turning rose-gold, as if reluctant to let them go. Rio moved through the space with practiced efficiency, checking the locks, setting the alarms, and making sure everything was ready for their departure.</span></p><p><span>Agatha lingered in the doorway, watching her. “You really don’t want to leave, do you?” she asked softly.</span></p><p><span>Rio glanced up, then sighed, letting a rare vulnerability seep through. “This place is the only spot I’ve ever felt completely… safe. Like the rest of the world can’t touch me here.” She looked down at her hands, then back up at Agatha. “And now it feels different, because you were here with me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s chest tightened. She crossed the room, laying a hand on Rio’s cheek. “Then it’s not just your safe place anymore. It’s ours.”</span></p><p><span>Rio closed her eyes, leaning into the touch, savoring the moment before reality called them back. “I like the sound of that.”</span></p><p><span>They stepped out onto the deck one last time, the air cool, pine-scented, the hush of the woods wrapping around them like a blanket. Agatha leaned against the railing, eyes on the horizon. “I’ll miss this. The quiet. The normalcy. Just… us.”</span></p><p><span>Rio slipped behind her, arms winding around Agatha’s waist, resting her chin on her shoulder. “We’ll come back,” she promised. “Whenever it gets too loud out there, we’ll come back here. This place isn’t going anywhere.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned her head just enough to brush her lips against Rio’s temple. “Hold you to that, darling.”</span></p><p><span>For a long while, they just stood there, letting the silence and the fading light settle into them. Two women who had found something unexpected in each other—peace, laughter, fire, and something dangerously close to love.</span></p><p><span>When they finally walked down to the waiting car, hand in hand, the cabin stood behind them in shadow, quiet and steadfast. A secret they’d carry with them back into the chaos of the world.</span></p><p><span>And though leaving felt bittersweet, both knew it wasn’t goodbye.</span></p><p><span>It was only the beginning.</span></p>

<p><span>The hum of the private jet was steady, almost soothing, as it cut through the clouds on its way back to Los Angeles. Agatha curled up sideways in her seat, blanket draped over her legs, watching Rio with sharp, unblinking eyes.</span></p><p><span>Rio hadn’t sat once since the flight began. She stood at the window with her arms crossed, posture rigid, scanning the horizon like there was something dangerous lurking among the clouds. Her expression was all angles again, controlled, unreadable, and it stung after two days of seeing her relaxed, smiling, even playful.</span></p><p><span>“Darling,” Agatha broke the silence, voice low, teasing but edged with sincerity. “If I didn’t know better, I’d think you were guarding Fort Knox instead of a lovesick actress.”</span></p><p><span>Rio glanced over her shoulder, mouth twitching but never quite forming a smile. “You’re my client, Agatha. I’m doing my job.”</span></p><p><span>There it was. The word Agatha hated: client. It built walls faster than her mother ever could. She sat up straighter, tugging the blanket from her lap, irritation simmering. “Funny, didn’t feel much like a client when you were carrying me to bed last night.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw clenched. She didn’t deny it. Didn’t even flinch. Just went back to staring out the window, muscles taut under her flannel shirt.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sighed, softer now, but no less pointed. “You don’t have to shut me out the second we hit the runway back to reality. I know the game. I’ve lived in it longer than you’ve guarded people through it.”</span></p><p><span>That got Rio’s attention. She turned, eyes dark but conflicted. “You don’t understand. Out there, everything we do gets magnified. The photoshoot was already too much; people are dissecting every look, every touch. If I slip, even once, it won’t just cost me. It could cost you your career.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha tilted her head, studying her like she was breaking down a script. “And if you keep building those walls, it might cost us our relationship before we even begin.”</span></p><p><span>The air between them was thick with things neither wanted to say. Rio looked away first, exhaling slowly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha shifted gears, voice lighter, teasing again, but her eyes still carried that weight. “You know, you’re a real killjoy sometimes. I’m trying to romanticize us like some tragic queer indie movie, and you’re over here worried about optics.”</span></p><p><span>Rio couldn’t help it, a ghost of a smile tugged at her lips. “Somebody has to keep you alive long enough to win another Oscar.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s the spirit.” Agatha grinned, but her expression softened. She reached across the aisle, catching Rio’s hand in hers and squeezing. “We’ll figure it out, both of us. But don’t rob me of what we just had at the cabin. I need that memory more than I need another PR strategy.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s fingers flexed against hers, holding on a beat longer than she probably should have. “I’ll try, cariño.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned back into her seat, satisfied enough for now. She pulled the blanket over herself again and smirked. “Good. Because if you think I’m letting you pretend we didn’t just have the best sex of your life, you’re out of your damn mind.”</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned quietly, dragging a hand down her face, but Agatha caught the pink flush creeping up her ears. That was enough of a victory for now.</span></p><p><span>The rest of the flight passed in silence, Rio keeping her silent vigil, Agatha pretending to nap but stealing glances every few minutes. Both women knew the moment the wheels hit L.A. pavement, the world would be waiting.</span></p><p><span>And for the first time, Agatha wasn’t sure if she was ready to share Rio with it.</span></p><p><span>The wheels screeched against the tarmac, jolting Agatha fully awake. Rio’s hand tightened briefly on the armrest, the only outward sign of nerves she ever allowed herself. By the time the jet slowed, she was already unbuckling, professional mask locked firmly back in place.</span></p><p><span>“Stay close when we leave the hangar,” she said, clipped, calm. “Alice and Yelena will meet us at the gate with the SUV. Clint’s already scouting the perimeter.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha yawned, stretching like a cat, her hair a mess from the nap. “You know, for a second there I thought you were about to tuck me in with milk and cookies. But no, straight back to Captain Stoneface.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shot her a look, sharp, but softened by the faintest twitch of her lips. “You’ll thank me in about three minutes.”</span></p><p><span>She wasn’t wrong.</span></p><p><span>The moment they stepped off the jet, the faint roar of voices grew louder. By the time the hangar door rolled open to the private airfield’s parking lot, it hit them like a wave. Paparazzi camera flashes strobed in every direction, fans pressed against barricades, shouting Agatha’s name.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha, is what Jessica Jones said true? Are you in danger?!”</span><span><br/></span><span> “Are there really stalkers after you?!”</span><span><br/></span><span> “Where did you go this weekend?!”</span><span><br/></span><span> “Agatha, are you and your bodyguard dating?!”</span></p><p><span>The questions were relentless, shouted over each other, drowning out the hum of engines and the clatter of luggage carts.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t flinch. She tightened her grip on Agatha’s hand, tugging her firmly toward the waiting SUV. Yelena was already at the door, body angled like a wall between them and the crowd. Alice had her phone up, live-monitoring social feeds, eyes darting between Agatha, the mob, and the car.</span></p><p><span>“Jesus Christ,” Agatha muttered under her breath, keeping her trademark smile plastered on for the cameras. Her free hand went up in a casual wave, the kind she’d mastered years ago, approachable, charming, untouchable.</span></p><p><span>“Keep moving,” Rio murmured, low enough only Agatha could hear. “Don’t stop. Don’t answer questions. Straight into the car.”</span></p><p><span>“If I didn’t know any better, I’d think you didn’t want me to bask in my adoring coven.”</span></p><p><span>“Not when half of them might be holding cameras for the wrong reasons,” Rio countered, her eyes scanning every face in the crowd.</span></p><p><span>By the time they reached the SUV, Bucky had materialized from nowhere, a towering presence making the photographers take a cautious half-step back. He held the door open, and Rio all but guided Agatha inside before following, shutting it firmly behind them.</span></p><p><span>The second the locks clicked, the noise outside muffled to a dull roar. Agatha exhaled hard, leaning her head back against the leather seat. “God, I missed anonymity.”</span></p><p><span>“You handled it perfectly,” Rio said, settling beside her but still watching the windows, muscles tight. “No cracks, no tells. Exactly what we needed.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha cracked an eye open at her, a little smirk tugging her lips. “You know, most girlfriends would say, ‘You look beautiful, darling, even after a five-hour flight.’ But no. I get a field report.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw twitched. She hesitated, then reached over, brushing her thumb briefly against Agatha’s hand where it rested on her thigh. “You do look beautiful. Always.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked, her smirk softening into something warmer. She squeezed Rio’s hand once, deliberately, before letting it go. “That’s better.”</span></p><p><span>Outside, the SUV cut through the mob, cameras still flashing until the gates closed behind them. The noise faded. The city loomed ahead.</span></p><p><span>And just like that, the bubble of the cabin was gone. Reality, with all its dangers and demands, had reclaimed them.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tilted her head against the window, watching the blur of lights. “Back to the real world, huh?”</span></p><p><span>Rio glanced at her reflection in the glass, voice quiet but steady. “Not exactly. You still have me.”</span></p><p><span>The SUV rolled to a stop in front of Agatha’s mansion. The house looked the same as when they’d left, towering glass, ivy creeping up dark stone, a fortress dressed as art. But to Agatha, it felt different now. Less like a sanctuary, more like a cage. Reality pressed in from all sides.</span></p><p><span>Rio cut the engine and glanced at her. “You ready, cariño?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked, though the edge of exhaustion dulled it. “Do I look ready?”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Rio admitted, lips twitching. “But I’ve got you.”</span></p><p><span>That was enough to make Agatha unclench her jaw and nod. Together, they stepped out, greeted instantly by Natasha and Bucky flanking the door. Alice stood off to the side, tablet in hand, Yelena pacing like a wolf on a leash. Inside, Clint sat at the dining table, already nursing a cup of coffee like it was whiskey.</span></p><p><span>It felt like walking into a war room, except the war was her life.</span></p><p><span>Agatha had barely set her purse down before Jen came barreling down the hall, phone in one hand, notebook in the other. “Where the hell have you </span><em><span>been</span></em><span>?” she hissed. “Do you have any idea the nightmare you’ve dumped in my lap? The press is frothing. Fans think you’ve been kidnapped. Social media is split between #WhereIsAgatha and #Agathario, trending like wildfire. And don’t get me started on Jessica’s article. You’ve been silent for three days. I need quotes. I need angles. I need damage control.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha groaned, tossing her sunglasses onto the counter. “Hello to you, too, Jen. Missed you.”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t sass me, Agatha.” Jen jabbed her notebook at her like it was a weapon. “People are demanding a comment. You can’t just disappear after an exposé about stalkers and smear campaigns drops. It makes you look guilty or worse, detached.”</span></p><p><span>“Detached?” Agatha snorted. “Sweetheart, I’ve been many things. Detached is not one of them.”</span></p><p><span>“Then prove it!” Jen snapped. “We need to put out a statement by tonight. Even if it’s just you thanking fans for support and confirming you’re safe. Otherwise, the vultures will write the narrative for us.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped between them, voice calm but firm. “She just walked through the door. Let her breathe, Jen.”</span></p><p><span>Jen’s glare slid to Rio. “And you, don’t think you’re off the hook. Half of Twitter is thirsting over you like you’re some tattooed Greek goddess, the other half is digging up your military record and spinning conspiracy theories. I have journalists asking me if your scars mean you tortured people for fun.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw ticked. “Let them ask. I don’t answer to them.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha, sensing Rio’s tension, reached for her hand, grounding her with the smallest touch. The whole team noticed. Yelena’s eyes widened, Alice’s brows shot up, and Clint spat coffee halfway across the table.</span></p><p><span>“Wait a damn minute,” Clint coughed, wiping his chin. “Did I just see what I think I saw?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked, threading her fingers through Rio’s. “Depends. Did you see me holding the hand of the sexiest, most infuriatingly professional woman alive? Then yes. You saw correctly.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha arched an eyebrow, voice flat. “You two finally fucked.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s grin widened, wicked as ever. “Oh, more than once, darling.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky groaned, dragging a hand down his face. Alice let out a little cheer, clapping her hands together. Yelena just grinned like a cat who’d caught a bird. “Finally,” she muttered. Money exchanged hands between the team</span></p><p><span>“You bet on us?” Agatha asked, smirking.</span></p><p><span>“Duh, easy money, honestly.” Yelena laughed.</span></p><p><span>Rio flushed scarlet, tugging at her collar. “You’re all insufferable.”</span></p><p><span>“You love us,” Alice teased. Then she smirked. “But not as much as you love her.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shot her a look sharp enough to cut steel, but Agatha only leaned against her side, clearly enjoying every second of the reveal. “Don’t worry, hot stuff,” she said sweetly. “They’ll get used to us. Eventually.”</span></p><p><span>“Us?” Natasha repeated, tone dry but curious.</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned, chin high, voice firm. “Yes. </span><em><span>Us.</span></em><span> We’re official. Girlfriends. Partners. Whatever label you like best. And before you all start groaning, let me be very clear: she makes me happy. That’s non-negotiable.”</span></p><p><span>For a moment, the room was silent. Then Clint muttered, “Guess the spray bottle won’t cut it anymore.”</span></p><p><span>That broke the tension. Laughter rippled through the room, even Rio’s mouth twitching at the corners.</span></p><p><span>Jen, however, remained unimpressed. She flipped her notebook shut with a snap. “That’s all very sweet, but relationships don’t stop headlines, Agatha. We need a statement </span><em><span>tonight.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>Agatha sighed, finally sinking into a chair. “Fine. Draft something. But I want it in my voice, not yours. Fans will know the difference.”</span></p><p><span>“Done.” Jen scribbled a note. “But you’re filming tomorrow. No disappearing again. Not unless you want a full-blown media circus parked outside your house.”</span></p><p><span>“I already have a circus,” Agatha muttered, gesturing to the team.</span></p><p><span>Yelena threw a balled-up napkin at her. “You love us.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha winked. “Most of you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio finally sat beside her, their knees brushing. The noise of the room faded for a moment, the warmth of Agatha’s hand in hers enough to drown out the chaos. But she could still feel it pressing in, Jen’s demands, the world outside clawing at the gates, the knowledge that the stalkers weren’t done.</span></p><p><span>She leaned closer, whispering low enough only Rio could hear. “Feels like the cabin was a dream, doesn’t it?”</span></p><p><span>Rio squeezed her hand. “Then we hold onto it. Let them scream, let them dig. We know what’s real.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned to meet her eyes, and for a second, it was just them again. No cameras. No threats. No lies. Just two women who had finally stopped running from what they felt.</span></p><p><span>Jen’s voice cut back in, sharp as a whip. “Alright, Agatha. Press statement first. Then we talk about social media strategy. Then we prep you for interviews. And for God’s sake, put on a shirt that doesn’t make you look like you just rolled out of someone’s bed.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked. “But I did.” She tilted her head toward Rio.</span></p><p><span>Clint choked again. Alice nearly fell off her chair laughing. Natasha muttered something in Russian that sounded suspiciously like a prayer for patience.</span></p><p><span>Rio buried her face in her hands. “I hate all of you.”</span></p><p><span>But when Agatha rested her head on Rio’s shoulder, her smirk softening into something almost tender, Rio let herself breathe. Just for a second.</span></p><p><span>The cabin might be gone. Reality might be loud, messy, and dangerous. But they had each other. And that, Rio thought, might just be enough.</span></p>

<p><span>Morning sunlight filtered weakly through the tinted windows of the compound, but the atmosphere inside was anything but calm. Jen stood at the head of the dining table, laptop open, glasses perched on her nose like a general ready for battle. A thick stack of printed notes and highlighted drafts sat in front of her.</span></p><p><span>“Alright, Agatha,” she began briskly, “we need to talk about your first official response to Jessica’s article. You’ve been radio silent for three days, and while the piece has done wonders at painting you as the victim of a targeted smear campaign, the press is circling like sharks over your </span><em><span>disappearance</span></em><span>. They want your voice on record.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha groaned theatrically, dropping into a chair and stealing Rio’s coffee like it belonged to her. “Good morning to you, too, sunshine.”</span></p><p><span>“This isn’t funny.” Jen’s tone sharpened, though her eyes flickered between Agatha and Rio with something suspiciously close to a smirk. “#WhereIsAgatha has been trending since last night. People are convinced you’ve either fled the country, entered rehab, or joined a cult. We need to get ahead of it before conspiracy TikTok decides you’ve been replaced by a clone.”</span></p><p><span>Across the table, Yelena choked on her juice. “A clone would behave better.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha ignored her, swiveling toward Jen. “Fine, read me your masterpiece. Let’s see what the world apparently needs to hear.”</span></p><p><span>Jen adjusted her glasses and cleared her throat. “In light of recent events and harmful fabrications, I want to thank my fans for their unwavering support. Jessica Jones’ reporting has been accurate, and I stand by her article fully. I have always treated my colleagues, my fans, and my crew with respect, and I will continue to do so. As for the rumors—”</span></p><p><span>Agatha raised a hand, cutting her off. “Respectful, heartfelt, professional… and boring. You’re stripping me of my personality.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re not allowed a personality when your career’s on the line,” Jen snapped back, though there was a note of fondness buried under the exasperation. “This has to be airtight, Agatha. No smirks. No sarcasm. No </span><em><span>hot stuff</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>At that, the entire table glanced toward Rio, who shifted uncomfortably in her chair. Agatha, of course, only smiled wickedly and reached over to squeeze Rio’s thigh under the table.</span></p><p><span>Jen pinched the bridge of her nose. “God help me.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky leaned back in his chair, arms crossed. “She’s not wrong, though. If Agatha puts out something too polished, it won’t sound like her. The fans who know her best will smell PR spin.”</span></p><p><span>“Exactly,” Agatha said, pointing at him like he’d just handed her the Holy Grail. “See? Even grumpy over here agrees with me.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m not grumpy,” Bucky muttered, though the corner of his mouth twitched.</span></p><p><span>Natasha sipped her coffee, unimpressed. “She has a point, Jen. Agatha’s reputation has always been tied to being brutally herself. If you take that away, the stalkers win. They get to rewrite who she is.”</span></p><p><span>Jen sighed, clearly outnumbered, though she wasn’t ready to fold. “Fine. Then what do you suggest? You can’t exactly tweet, ‘I’m innocent, screw you haters,’ and expect the world to forgive and forget.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, but imagine the headline,” Agatha said with a wicked grin. “America’s Witch Tells World to Screw Off.”</span></p><p><span>Clint actually choked on his coffee. Yelena pounded him on the back while wheezing with laughter.</span></p><p><span>Rio finally stepped in, her voice calm but firm. “We need balance. Agatha, you can’t lose your voice, but Jen’s right, this isn’t the time for jokes. What if we keep the tone genuine, but add something personal at the end? A line that reminds people you’re human. Something only you would say.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned to her, eyes softening just slightly. “Like what?”</span></p><p><span>Rio shrugged, fingers brushing Agatha’s hand under the table in a grounding gesture. “Something simple. Like how much you appreciate the fans who stuck by you. Or how much it means to have people in your corner right now.”</span></p><p><span>The room went quiet for a moment, the weight of Rio’s words sinking in. Agatha’s smirk melted into something more thoughtful, and she squeezed Rio’s hand. “I like that,” she said softly.</span></p><p><span>Alice, who’d been typing away, finally looked up with a grin. “Wow. She listens to </span><em><span>you</span></em><span>. Noted.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha narrowed her eyes at her but didn’t let go of Rio’s hand. “Careful, Alice. I know where you sleep.”</span></p><p><span>“Please,” Yelena scoffed. “You’d get lost trying to sneak into her room.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the tension at the table eased as Jen sighed and shut her laptop. “Alright, we’ll draft something that threads the needle, your voice, your tone, but professional enough to keep the wolves at bay. And we’ll schedule a brief, tightly controlled press Q&amp;A in a few days. No surprises, no ad-libbing. Understood?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha made a face but nodded. “Understood, boss.”</span></p><p><span>“Good.” Jen started stacking her papers, muttering, “Though I still say clones would be easier.”</span></p><h3><b>Official Statement from Agatha Harkness</b></h3><p><em><span>Over the past few days, a series of false claims, doctored videos, and fabricated accounts have circulated about me. I want to be absolutely clear: these stories are untrue.</span></em></p><p><em><span>In my nearly forty years working in this industry, I have treated every cast member, crew member, and fan I’ve encountered with respect. I take pride in the relationships I’ve built on set and with the people who support my work.

Agatha typing “thank you for sticking by me” feels like a hug through the screen.</span></p><p><b>@CovenDetectives: </b><span>Notice how she never once named the stalkers, never gave them the attention they wanted. Classic Agatha power move. Starve them of the spotlight.</span></p><p><b>@CallMeDaddy:</b><span> The fact that she managed to sound humble, grateful, AND still hot is why she’s America’s Witch.</span></p><p><b>@ChaosCoven: </b><span>She could murder me in cold blood, and I’d still post bail.</span></p><p><b>@Pray4Agatha: </b><span>Seeing the fandom unite under her statement after the smear attempt has me sobbing. This is what loyalty looks like.</span></p><p><b>@ShipItAgathario: </b><span>Also, not to be that person, but you can FEEL Rio’s influence in this. I bet she helped write it. (No, I will not elaborate.)</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The following month was hectic. Paparazzi and media attention were still at an all-time high, and fan speculation ran rampant, especially about Agatha and Rio’s relationship. The two kept things strictly professional in public, or as professional as Agatha was capable of being. Behind closed doors, however, their relationship had only grown stronger. Rio had taken to sleeping in Agatha’s room whenever she wasn’t on shift, and the two managed to steal private moments whenever they could.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s filming schedule had finally kicked off, grueling as ever, but the stalkers had remained hidden. No further moves, no close calls. Still, Rio knew it was only a matter of time before they resurfaced.</span></p><p><span>Alice had been working tirelessly, tracking every lead she could get her hands on. Natasha had slipped away for a few days to meet with a contact in hopes of digging up more information on Raven. Meanwhile, Bucky was leaning on his old networks, speaking to contacts across the globe to gather intel on the group’s movements.</span></p><p><span>Now, the entire team and Agatha sat gathered around the dining room table, papers and laptops spread out across the surface as they prepared to go over the new information they had collected.</span></p><p><span>The dining room table was no longer recognizable as a place for meals. It was buried beneath papers, laptops, photographs, and maps covered in inked lines; the chaos was contained only by the focused energy of the people surrounding it. Coffee mugs, some full, most empty, marked the hours of work already poured into this war room.</span></p><p><span>Rio stood at the head of the table, hands braced against the wood, posture sharp and commanding. Around her sat the team: Natasha, relaxed but hawk-eyed; Bucky, glued to the coffee pot; Clint leaning in the corner with arms folded; Yelena twirling her knife with restless ease; Alice hunched over her laptop, scrolling through feeds at lightning pace. Jen perched at the far end with her phone buzzing nonstop, while Agatha sat beside Rio, tense, her usually unshakable bravado nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p><span>Alice finally broke the silence, her voice clear despite the fatigue etched into her features. “Alright. Here’s what we’ve pieced together.” She spun her laptop to face the group. The screen lit up with a symbol: a cicada, stylized and jagged.</span></p><p><span>“This image showed up buried in every breach of Agatha’s old security system. It’s their digital signature.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s brow furrowed. “Why a cicada?”</span></p><p><span>“Because cicadas are impossible to ignore,” Alice explained. “They’re loud. They disappear, then return. They’re announcing themselves every time they infiltrate. Which means this wasn’t random, it was deliberate. They wanted us to know it was them.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw flexed. “Them?”</span></p><p><span>Alice nodded. “Kyra Auden. Confirmed. I was able to track her IP address back to her, even though she is very good at covering her tracks. And I’m ninety percent certain her sister, Seren Auden, is the second hacker. I tracked them through old stan accounts and fan projects from years ago. They ran massive campaigns to promote Agatha’s early work. One of those campaigns went viral; you even acknowledged them once, Agatha. Retweeted them. Thanked them. And then…”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s stomach twisted. “…And then I moved on. Didn’t engage again.”</span></p><p><span>“Exactly,” Alice said. “They built a fantasy where they ‘made you.’ When you stopped feeding that fantasy, they felt abandoned. Betrayed. And now they’re rewriting the story so you owe them.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha leaned forward, voice steady. “So we have two hackers, sisters, motivated by obsession and parasocial behavior. What about money?”</span></p><p><span>Alice pulled up another document: bank records. “Ralph Bohner, the shooter, wasn’t freelance. He was being paid through an offshore account opened right before the stalking started. The money traces back to an organization calling itself </span><em><span>The Seventh Veil</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>The name dropped like a stone into the silence.</span></p><p><span>Bucky frowned. “Sounds like a shell org. A front for someone with serious reach.”</span></p><p><span>“Or a cult,” Yelena muttered, spinning her knife. “The name screams cult.”</span></p><p><span>Alice shrugged. “Could be either. But whoever it is, they’re funding everything: gear, payoffs, Ralph’s involvement. They’re not amateurs.”</span></p><p><span>Rio straightened. “The enforcer?”</span></p><p><span>“Still nameless,” Alice admitted. “But we can trace their work. Every time someone became a liability, they turned up dead. Ralph wasn’t the first. The pattern’s too clean.”</span></p><p><span>Before the weight of that could settle, Jen glanced up from her buzzing phone. “What about the smear campaign? The ‘difficult to work with’ stories, the fake video?”</span></p><p><span>“That wasn’t the Cicadas,” Alice said firmly. “It doesn’t match their signature. That was Renna.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stiffened at the name.</span></p><p><span>“Renna ran your biggest stan Twitter back in the day,” Alice explained gently. “When you rejected her, when you refused to cross that line, she twisted it into humiliation. She’s weaponizing PR now, hitting the one place she knows will hurt most: your reputation. The timing lines up, too. The smear only started once the other moves escalated.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed hard. Her voice cracked despite her best effort to keep it sharp. “She was underage when I first met her. I would </span><em><span>never</span></em><span>. And years later, when she was older, she tried again. I told her no. That’s all it took? To turn her into this?”</span></p><p><span>“Obsession doesn’t need much,” Natasha said simply.</span></p><p><span>“And Raven?” Rio pressed.</span></p><p><span>Alice clicked through another folder: a grainy still of Agatha’s old assistant, Raven Corvin. “We don’t know her role yet. But her connection is too obvious to ignore. She’s been quiet, but too quiet. My gut says she’s in the mix. We just don’t know where.”</span></p><p><span>Clint’s brow furrowed. “And the others? We know there’s more.”</span></p><p><span>Alice nodded reluctantly. “At least two. Maybe more. First: the </span><em><span>Watcher</span></em><span>. Someone is shadowing Agatha in public. Always at a distance. Always blending into the background. I’ve spotted them in multiple fan photos and paparazzi shots, but haven’t gotten a clear enough photo to run through facial recognition software. They’re cataloguing her every move, feeding intel back to the group.</span></p><p><span>Second: the </span><em><span>Infiltrator</span></em><span>. Whoever broke into Agatha’s trailer and sabotaged the light clasp had direct access. Calm, methodical. No panic. This wasn’t a crime of opportunity. It was surgical. Whoever they are, they can get close. Very close.”</span></p><p><span>The words sat heavily over the table.</span></p><p><span>“So,” Clint summarized, voice clipped, “we’ve got: the Cicada sisters hacking cameras, Renna running PR sabotage, Ralph dead but connected, an enforcer cleaning house, Raven lurking somewhere in the background, a Watcher tailing Agatha, an Infiltrator breaking into her space, and a mastermind funding it all under </span><em><span>The Seventh Veil</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s the picture,” Alice said grimly.</span></p><p><span>The words seemed to echo around the table. Agatha pushed back suddenly, standing too quickly. Her hands trembled as she braced them on the back of her chair, staring down at the wood like it might give her answers. “All of this because I didn’t retweet someone? Because I told a girl no? Because I fired an assistant who was stealing from me?”</span></p><p><span>Her voice rose, breaking under the pressure. “I have worked my ass off my whole life, and now what? A group of bitter, obsessed nobodies who think they can </span><em><span>own me</span></em><span>? That they can destroy me because I didn’t give them enough attention?!”</span></p><p><span>The team stayed quiet, the storm in her voice crashing through the room.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s breath hitched. “I can’t—” Her voice broke completely. “I can’t keep waiting for the next attack. For the next lie. For the next body in the street. I can’t…”</span></p><p><span>Rio was already moving. She came up behind Agatha, steady hands reaching for hers, gently prying them from the chair. She turned Agatha toward her, their eyes locking.</span></p><p><span>“You won’t,” Rio said, voice low and unyielding. “Because you’re not alone. Not anymore. We’ll find them. Every last one. And when we do—” Her jaw tightened. “They’ll regret ever thinking they could touch you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let herself collapse against Rio, her forehead pressing into her shoulder, silent tears spilling down her cheeks. For the first time in weeks, she let herself break.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s arms closed around her like armor. Strong. Steady. Unshakable.</span></p><p><span>And though the room was still heavy with danger, for that moment, for Agatha, it was enough.</span></p><p><span>Agatha had excused herself upstairs to wash her face and breathe, leaving the team in the dining room. The quiet that followed her absence was heavy, but Rio knew they couldn’t afford to sit in silence.</span></p><p><span>“Alright,” she said firmly, reclaiming the head of the table. “We’ve identified the players. Now we focus on containment and counteraction.”</span></p><p><span>Alice straightened, already pulling up files. “Priority one is the </span><em><span>Watcher</span></em><span>. If someone’s tailing Agatha in public, we can catch them. I’ll set up facial-recognition alerts tied to every paparazzi and fan photo uploaded in real-time. If they’re in the crowd, we’ll know.”</span></p><p><span>“Yelena and I will take point in the field,” Natasha added. “We’ll shadow Agatha from a distance, spot anyone who shadows too close. If we find our Watcher, we’ll bring them in alive. They’ll talk.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky set down his mug. “That leaves the </span><em><span>Infiltrator</span></em><span>. Someone with access and nerves of steel. Could be crew. It could be someone bribed to get close. I’ll work my contacts, see if anyone’s selling passes or IDs.”</span></p><p><span>Clint nodded. “I’ll cover the catwalks and rooftops again. If someone tries another stunt, I’ll see them before they get the chance.”</span></p><p><span>Alice tapped a new tab open. “The Cicadas are sloppy in one way: they want credit. I’m going to bait them. Set up fake systems with Agatha’s name plastered all over them, see if they bite. Once they leave their signature, I can triangulate their location.”</span></p><p><span>“And Raven?” Natasha asked.</span></p><p><span>“Leave her to me,” Rio said, her voice flat and deadly calm. “She’s close enough to hurt us, but she won’t see me coming. When we find her, we’ll know her role.”</span></p><p><span>The team exchanged glances, grim, but unified.</span></p><p><span>Jen finally broke the silence, her voice softer than usual. “And what about Agatha?”</span></p><p><span>Rio looked toward the stairs, jaw firm. “We keep her safe. We give her enough space to breathe so she doesn’t feel like a prisoner, but not one of these bastards gets within ten feet of her. She’s our client, and she’s mine to protect.”</span></p><p><span>The finality in her tone left no room for argument.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>A week later, Agatha was scheduled for a sit-down on </span><em><span>The Late Night Spotlight</span></em><span> with Peter Parker, a man known for his boyish charm and sometimes awkward delivery, but also for his genuine warmth and respect toward his guests. Agatha had always thought highly of him, even privately telling Jen she hoped he’d have a long career in Hollywood.</span></p><p><span>When the SUV pulled up to the studio, the sound of screaming fans was immediate. Jen and Billy got out first, ushered by security, while the wall of voices swelled around them. Fans pushed and shoved against the barricades, desperate for a glimpse of their favorite star. Some shouted Agatha’s name, others thrust posters and phones into the air, hoping for an autograph or selfie. Paparazzi were already shouting over one another, hurling incomprehensible questions while flashes went off in staccato bursts.</span></p><p><span>Bucky, Natasha, and Clint moved like a shield, pushing the crowd back with disciplined precision. Yelena had already melted into the mass of people, her eyes constantly scanning for any sign of the Watcher. Inside the building, Alice monitored security feeds, ready to intercept anything suspicious.</span></p><p><span>Inside the SUV, Rio’s gaze never left the scene outside. “As usual,” she reminded, her voice clipped, “no photos, no autographs, no stopping.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hand shot out, resting over Rio’s arm before she could reach for the door handle. “No,” she said firmly. “I have to stop this time.”</span></p><p><span>Rio turned to her, sharp. “Agatha—”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head, cutting her off. “I haven’t stopped for fans in weeks. Not since the smear campaign. They need to know I still love them, that I appreciate them. Hiding away just feeds into the lies. I need to give back, even if it’s just for a minute. Sign some things. Take a few pictures.”</span></p><p><span>Her tone left no room for doubt. This wasn’t a whim; it was something Agatha had decided long before the SUV pulled up to the studio.</span></p><p><span>Rio studied her eyes, saw the determination there, and knew the battle was already lost. With a sigh, she relented. “Fine. But only a few. And if I tell you it’s time to move, you move. No questions. Understood?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s smile softened some of the tension in the car. “Understood. I promise.”</span></p><p><span>She leaned in then, a quick impulse, lips tilting toward Rio’s for a kiss. But Rio drew back at the last second, her expression torn.</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze, hurt flickering across her face. “What—?”</span></p><p><span>“Not here, cariño. Not now.” Rio’s voice was low, almost apologetic, and the guilt in her eyes was unmistakable.</span></p><p><span>For a moment, Agatha just looked at her, a storm brewing in her expression. She hated hiding. She hated having to keep this part of them locked away. But she also understood the stakes and the risks. After a beat, she only sighed, glare fading into resignation. With a short nod, she gestured toward the door. “Then let’s get it over with.”</span></p><p><span>Rio wanted to say more, to reach out and fix the sharp edges she’d left in Agatha’s expression, but it wasn’t the time. Instead, she lifted her radio. “Change of plans. Harkness wants to stop for autographs. Keep formation, eyes sharp.”</span></p><p><span>One by one, the team’s acknowledgments crackled back through her earpiece.</span></p><p><span>Rio squared her shoulders, mask of control sliding back into place, and finally opened the SUV door.</span></p><p><span>The moment Agatha’s heels clicked against the pavement, the crowd erupted. Cheers, screams, and the crackle of camera shutters swelled into a wall of sound that nearly drowned out the hum of the city. Fans surged forward against the barricades, security holding firm as voices rose in a chorus of her name.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha! Over here!”</span><span><br/></span><span> “Please sign this, I love you!”</span><span><br/></span><span> “Mother, we adore you!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha plastered on her signature smile, that dazzling, magnetic grin that had charmed audiences for decades. But to Rio, who never let herself drift more than two steps away, the expression looked heavier than usual, as though Agatha was holding her mask firmly in place for the sake of the people who adored her.</span></p><p><span>Bucky flanked her left side, a towering wall of muscle that kept anyone from reaching too close. Natasha had positioned herself slightly ahead, her sharp eyes scanning every outstretched hand, every shifting figure. Clint had his long lens raised, not for glamour shots but for surveillance, photographing faces in the crowd to be run through Alice’s system later.</span></p><p><span>Agatha crouched slightly at the barricade, signing a glossy still from </span><em><span>Agnes of Westview</span></em><span>, then another from her early career. A young fan, trembling with excitement, asked for a selfie, and Agatha leaned in without hesitation, holding the girl’s phone steady and flashing a wink into the camera. The girl burst into tears, clutching the device to her chest as though it were a treasure.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw clenched, her gaze never leaving the shifting tide of bodies. She could feel Yelena in the crowd, moving like smoke, brushing past fans with the casualness of someone who belonged, yet her hand was always near her blade. In Rio’s ear, Alice’s calm voice threaded through the noise:</span></p><p><span>“Nothing yet on cameras. The crowd’s excitable but clean so far.”</span></p><p><span>A paparazzo elbowed his way forward, shouting, “Agatha, is Rio your new girlfriend?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s head snapped up, sunglasses sliding slightly down her nose. Her smile didn’t falter, but her eyes hardened, cool as ice. “The only woman in my life right now is Wanda Maximoff,” she quipped, earning a laugh from the fans who caught the inside joke. She winked, pivoting effortlessly back to another autograph, but Rio noticed her grip on the pen tightened just slightly.</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped closer, her voice low but firm in Agatha’s ear. “Three more, then we move.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded without argument, though her grin widened at the little boy holding out a handmade poster with “We love you Agatha!” scrawled in crayon. She crouched to his level, signed the paper with a flourish, and whispered something that made the boy beam as though he’d just been handed the world.</span></p><p><span>The third autograph went to a woman in her forties holding an old, battered VHS of one of Agatha’s first films. Agatha’s laugh rang out, genuine this time, as she signed the worn sleeve. “You’ve been holding onto this longer than I’ve held onto my self-respect,” she teased, and the woman laughed along with her.</span></p><p><span>Then Rio’s voice cut through again, steel in her tone. “Time’s up. We move.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha and Bucky closed ranks immediately, gently but firmly steering Agatha away from the barricade. Clint barked a sharp “Let’s go!” into his comm as Yelena peeled back from the crowd, slipping into formation seamlessly.</span></p><p><span>The disappointed groans of fans followed them, mixed with shouted “We love you!” and the endless staccato of camera shutters. Agatha waved one last time before slipping into the studio doors.</span></p><p><span>Once they were inside, the noise muffled behind the walls. Agatha leaned against the cool marble of the hallway and exhaled. For a heartbeat, the mask dropped, and Rio saw the exhaustion in her eyes, the faint tremor in her hand from the adrenaline.</span></p><p><span>“You okay?” Rio asked, her voice softer now.</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded, forcing a smile back into place. “Better than okay. Did you see their faces? They needed that.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s lips pressed into a thin line, torn between pride and frustration. “And you almost gave me a heart attack.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked, slipping her sunglasses back into place. “Welcome to being in a relationship with me, darling.”</span></p><p><span>The house band wrapped a breezy riff as the stage lights warmed to a soft gold. Peter Parker jogged to his desk with that familiar mix of boyish enthusiasm and easy calm, then turned to the curtain with a grin.</span></p><p><span>“Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome—Academy Award winner, television icon, America’s favorite witch—Agatha Harkness!”</span></p><p><span>The audience roared as Agatha strode out in a tailored black suit with a silk lapel and a glinting amethyst ring, waving with easy charm. She crossed the stage, hugged Peter quickly, and settled into the chair opposite him. Her smile was dazzling but relaxed, her leg crossing effortlessly, the picture of composure.</span></p><p><span>“You look incredible. I feel underdressed, and this is my show,” Peter joked.</span></p><p><span>“Peter, please. We both know you were born in a suit,” Agatha fired back, then added with a grin, “The tie is excellent, though. Very </span><em><span>‘I pay my taxes on time.’</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>The audience burst out laughing. Peter clutched his chest like he’d been mortally wounded, and Rio, watching from the shadows just beyond the cameras, shook her head faintly. She’d been with Agatha long enough now to know this was her in her element, razor sharp, charming, and just dangerous enough. Still, Rio couldn’t stop the ghost of a smile tugging at her mouth.</span></p><p><span>Peter grinned. “I try! Okay, we’ve got a lot to talk about. The new movie, a certain co-star, the internet being…the internet. But first, how are you?”</span></p><p><span>“I’m good,” Agatha said, her tone playful but warm. “Busy, grateful, caffeinated. In that order.”</span></p><p><span>“The holy trinity. Let’s start with </span><em><span>Coven of Chaos.</span></em><span> Fans are feral, respectfully feral for this project. What can you tell us?”</span></p><p><span>“That it exists.”</span></p><p><span>The audience howled, and Peter dropped his head into his hands. Rio, arms folded across her chest just offstage, allowed herself a soft exhale of amusement. Agatha always had a way of turning any question into a performance.</span></p><p><span>“Okay, here’s what I can say,” Agatha continued, her voice turning rich and animated. “It’s intimate but epic. It’s about power, who holds it, who’s afraid of it, and what happens when you refuse to apologize for it. There’s folklore in its bones and found family at its heart. And the action sequences? Absolutely bonkers. Like, </span><em><span>please stretch before watching</span></em><span> bonkers.”</span></p><p><span>Rio glanced around the studio, noting every exit and scanning the crowd, but her eyes flicked back to Agatha more often than she’d admit. She wasn’t just watching for threats.</span></p><p><span>Peter leaned forward. “You’re working with Wanda Maximoff again. Your chemistry together is legendary. What keeps bringing you back together?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s smile softened. “Trust. We met decades ago when we were both young. We looked out for each other, and we built a language. On camera, I can say, </span><em><span>‘Try it,’</span></em><span> and she jumps without asking how high. Wanda is generous and terrifying in the best actor way, she raises the stakes and somehow makes you feel safe. It’s rare. I don’t take it for granted.”</span></p><p><span>The conversation rolled on, warm and witty, until Peter finally steered toward the subject Rio had been bracing for. He lifted a card that read, </span><em><span>“Agatha, blink twice if you’re dating your bodyguard.”</span></em></p><p><span>The crowd erupted. Agatha smirked and blinked…once.</span></p><p><span>“Peter, dear, I blink when I breathe.”</span></p><p><span>The audience roared. Peter grinned like a cat, but Rio’s spine went taut. She fought the urge to roll her eyes when Agatha’s gaze darted offstage and caught hers. Rio gave the smallest shake of her head, subtle enough that the cameras would never catch it. Agatha only tilted her head, lips quirking like she’d won a game no one else was playing.</span></p><p><span>Peter pressed on. “So, dating rumors. You and your head of security have been photographed together frequently. And, of course, there was a certain photoshoot that broke several servers and, allegedly, three marriages.”</span></p><p><span>“I plead attractive,” Agatha deadpanned, smirking.</span></p><p><span>The laughter was deafening. Rio shifted her weight, jaw tight. She could feel the heat creeping up her neck even though no one was looking at her. She wasn’t built for this kind of spotlight, and Agatha, wicked creature that she was, knew it.</span></p><p><span>Peter laughed along with the crowd. “Has the…reaction to your security team surprised you?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned in, the teasing fading to sincerity. “Honestly? Yes and no. They’re absurdly competent and, infuriatingly, even better looking in person. But here’s the thing: internet thirst is fun, often hilarious, but these are professionals with huge responsibilities. I’m lucky to have them. I also want them to be safe and respected, not treated like props in my life.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s throat tightened at that. Agatha didn’t just throw compliments around. The honesty in her voice left Rio both humbled and unsettled, and she shifted her eyes away before anyone could read too much in them.</span></p><p><span>The conversation flowed from there, boundaries, privacy, Jessica Jones’ article, and the smear campaign that nearly derailed everything. Agatha answered each question with equal parts wit and vulnerability, and the audience lapped it up. By the time Peter steered the interview toward a closing game of </span><em><span>Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts,</span></em><span> the crowd was fully under Agatha’s spell.</span></p><p><span>But Rio wasn’t watching the audience. She was watching Agatha. Watching the little tells in her posture, the way her smile dimmed for a heartbeat when Jessica’s name was mentioned, the way she snuck those glances toward the wings where Rio stood. And in those fleeting looks, Rio saw it: the anchor Agatha had started to use her for, steady in a storm of lights and noise.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t let herself smile, but the warmth in her chest was impossible to ignore.</span></p><p><span>Peter grinned as stagehands wheeled out a sleek black cart with silver platters on top. The audience broke into laughter and applause before the lids even came off.</span></p><p><span>“Ladies and gentlemen,” Peter announced, “it’s time for </span><em><span>Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>The crowd cheered. The band played a mischievous little riff. Agatha leaned back in her chair, crossing her legs like a queen settling into her throne.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, darling,” she drawled, smirking at Peter, “you don’t know what you’ve signed up for.”</span></p><p><span>“I think I do,” Peter said nervously, lifting one lid. The audience gasped as a plate of pickled pig’s feet was revealed. Another lid revealed something gloopy and unidentifiable, the third, fermented shark.</span></p><p><span>Agatha arched a brow. “Is this a game or a war crime?”</span></p><p><span>The crowd howled. Even Rio, lurking just beyond the curtain with her earpiece in, fought back a snort. She’d seen Agatha take down senators in interviews; fermented fish didn’t stand a chance. Still, Rio crossed her arms and braced herself. With Agatha, anything could happen.</span></p><p><span>Peter clasped his hands. “Alright, Agatha, you know the rules. Answer honestly, or take a bite.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned forward, chin propped on her hand. “Ask me anything, Parker. I have no shame.”</span></p><p><span>Peter grinned, checking his cards. “Okay. First question: Which of your </span><em><span>Coven of Chaos</span></em><span> co-stars is most likely to break character during a serious scene?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha barked out a laugh. “Wanda. Absolutely Wanda.”</span></p><p><span>The crowd roared.</span></p><p><span>“Really?” Peter asked, surprised.</span></p><p><span>“She looks all mysterious and composed, but the woman cannot keep it together if I even twitch an eyebrow. And then, of course, I laugh, and then we ruin the take. Millions of dollars down the drain.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked faintly from the wings. She’d already heard Wanda’s name a hundred times in Agatha’s stories, but hearing it with that warm affection made her chest squeeze.</span></p><p><span>Peter grinned wickedly. “Alright. Next question…Rank your security team, from most to least likely to sleep with.”</span></p><p><span>The audience </span><em><span>screamed.</span></em><span> Agatha threw her head back and laughed, delighted. Rio froze, pulse spiking.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, Parker, you’re cruel.”</span></p><p><span>“Answer or eat the shark,” Peter teased.</span></p><p><span>Agatha pretended to deliberate, twirling a strand of hair. Then she leaned toward the mic, eyes sparkling. “Number one, obviously, is Rio.”</span></p><p><span>The crowd </span><em><span>erupted.</span></em><span> Cameras panned immediately toward the wings, catching Rio just as she schooled her expression into flat professionalism. Her ears burned scarlet.</span></p><p><span>Agatha wasn’t done. “Two, Natasha, discipline is sexy. Three, Yelena, chaotic, but I bet she knows what she’s doing. Four, Alice, underrated, but I sense potential. Five, Bucky, he broods too much, and is a man. Six, Clint…darling, he’s like a brother to me, so it would feel like incest. Sorry, Clint.”</span></p><p><span>The audience was </span><em><span>losing it.</span></em><span> Peter nearly fell out of his chair. “You actually did it, you ranked them all!”</span></p><p><span>“Of course I did,” Agatha said smugly, brushing imaginary dust off her lapel. “I told you, I have no shame.”</span></p><p><span>Backstage, Clint’s voice came dry over comms: </span><em><span>“I didn’t need to hear that.”</span></em><span> Yelena’s laugh followed: </span><em><span>“I did.”</span></em><span> Rio pinched the bridge of her nose. She was already imagining the memes.</span></p><p><span>Peter wiped tears from his eyes. “Okay, okay. Next question: Who’s one Hollywood star you swore you’d never work with again?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s smile sharpened, but she answered without hesitation. “Tony Stark.”</span></p><p><span>Gasps rolled through the crowd.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah, I said it,” Agatha continued. “He showed up late every day, treated the crew like garbage, and once called me ‘sweetheart’ in a tone that made me want to set him on fire. I don’t care if it tanks my career, I’d rather do dinner theater in Des Moines than ever share a set with him again.”</span></p><p><span>The audience </span><em><span>exploded.</span></em><span> Peter was wheezing with laughter. Rio just shook her head. This woman…</span></p><p><span>Peter leaned closer, a mischievous glint in his eyes. “Be honest, how much of the Jessica Jones article did you have to edit before it went public?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed. “None. I didn’t touch a word. Jessica has a spine of steel, and she doesn’t need me to hold her hand. She did her job the way it should be done.”</span></p><p><span>The crowd cheered. Rio’s shoulders relaxed a little at that. She’d seen how much Jessica’s work had meant to Agatha, how it steadied her when things felt like they were spiraling. Hearing her affirm it so openly made Rio’s chest ache with pride.</span></p><p><span>Then Alice’s voice cut sharp into Rio’s ear: </span><em><span>“Rio. We’ve got a problem.”</span></em></p><p><span>Rio stiffened immediately, posture snapping to attention. </span><em><span>“Go.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Cicada. They’re inside the feed. I’m fighting to block them, but they’ve breached the overlays. They’re about to—”</span></em></p><p><span>The studio screens flickered. The laughter died instantly. On the massive monitors behind Peter’s desk, the broadcast jumped from the studio feed to a series of still images.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s blood ran cold.</span></p><p><span>The first was a private shot of Agatha, half-dressed in a trailer, clearly changing. Gasps erupted from the audience. More photos of Agatha in various states of undress. Peter spun around, horrified.</span></p><p><span>The next image was Wanda, candid and unguarded, at a dinner table. Then Jen in her office. Lilia at her home. Then, worst of all, files, documents, and data scrolling too fast to read, but undeniably personal. Pictures of Rio’s Delta team showed on screen, unblurred photos of the scene of the massacre, their dead bodies.</span></p><p><span>The audience buzzed in shock, confused murmurs rising like a wave.</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze in her chair, the blood draining from her face. For the first time all night, she wasn’t the composed star. She was just…exposed.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t hesitate. She strode onto the stage, ignoring the cameras, ignoring the audience, her focus entirely on Agatha. She put a hand on her shoulder, steady, grounding. “With me. Now.”</span></p><p><span>Peter, pale, fumbled at his earpiece, signaling producers. The crew scrambled, trying to cut the feed, but the images kept cycling, violations, invasions, every frame a taunt.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned down, her voice low but firm. “Don’t look at the screens. Eyes on me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s gaze darted to her, trembling on the edge of panic. Rio held it steady, a tether in the storm.</span></p><p><em><span>“Alice!”</span></em><span> Rio barked into her comm.</span></p><p><em><span>“Almost, hold, got it!”</span></em><span> Alice’s voice cracked through, and suddenly the screens went black. The studio lights buzzed, the silence deafening.</span></p><p><span>Then the feed returned to Peter’s show logo, the crisis smoothed over, but the damage was done.</span></p><p><span>The audience sat stunned, whispers ricocheting through the space. Peter looked stricken, already shifting into damage-control mode with his producers.</span></p><p><span>Agatha, still seated, pressed a hand to her mouth. For the first time in decades, she looked small on a stage.</span></p><p><span>Rio crouched in front of her, blocking the audience’s view as much as she could. Her voice was soft, but unyielding. “You’re safe. They didn’t win. Breathe, cariño. Just breathe.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hand found Rio’s wrist, clutching it hard enough to bruise. “They showed Wanda…Jen…Lilia…You!”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw clenched. Fury roared inside her chest like a wildfire, but her voice stayed calm. “And we’ll make them pay for it. But right now, we get you out.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded shakily, letting Rio guide her up. The crowd didn’t matter anymore. The cameras didn’t matter. All that mattered was getting Agatha out of the spotlight before the cracks in her mask could break wide open.</span></p><p><span>Behind the scenes, Alice’s voice came back into comms, ragged but resolute. </span><em><span>“I traced the breach. It was definitely Cicada. They wanted this spectacle—they wanted humiliation.”</span></em></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>And I’ve got a trace, their signal is inside the building</span></em><span>.” Alice’s voice snapped through the comms.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t hesitate. She stepped fully into the lights, placing herself in front of Agatha as the audience murmured, cameras still rolling and catching every second. “Locations, Alice.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha was already moving, boots hitting the stage with purpose as she came to flank Rio, one hand hovering near her concealed holster, eyes sweeping for angles and exits.</span></p><p><span>“I’m pushing photos to your phones now,” Alice said. “Running live face match on the crowd and backstage.”</span></p><p><span>A beat. Then Alice again, voice tight. “Got Kyra. Audience left side, aisle seat, eighth row. Black shirt, black pants.”</span></p><p><span>“Moving,” Bucky said over comms.</span></p><p><span>Yelena was a blur up the steps, Bucky right behind her. The crowd, stunned into silence moments ago, split on instinct at the sight of two armed professionals storming the aisle with intent written all over their faces. In the eighth row, a woman jerked to her feet as if shocked—Kyra. She hesitated one half-second too long, then bolted up the stairs.</span></p><p><span>“Clint?” Rio said.</span></p><p><span>“On it.” From the balcony above, Clint jumped down and planted himself at the top landing, blocking Kyra’s escape route. She pivoted, panicked, and tried to shoulder through the audience, shoving bodies with wild, flailing elbows. The crowd shouted, boxed her in, slowed her.</span></p><p><span>Yelena caught her by the wrist, pivoted, and used Kyra’s own momentum to slam her flat onto the carpet. A knee to the sternum, a wrist lock, clean, controlled, efficient. Bucky dropped to a crouch and zip-tied both of Kyra’s wrists behind her back before she could twist free. She screamed curses, the words dissolving into spit and fury. Phones were out everywhere now, dozens of angles capturing a hacker’s nightmare ending.</span></p><p><span>Onstage, Rio and Natasha were already moving. “We’re done here,” Rio murmured to Agatha, voice calm but iron-backed. “With me.” She and Nat shepherded her off the stage-left exit into a backstage corridor. Alice fell in behind, weapon out, slicing a hard look at every door they passed.</span></p><p><span>“I still can’t find Seren. Assume she’s on-site and waiting.” Alice warned.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t resist being pulled along. Her face was pale, her eyes glassy, shock tightening her breathing. The images on the monitors, herself half-dressed, Wanda at dinner, Jen and Lilia in their homes, were stamped across her thoughts like a brand.</span></p><p><span>They hit the side door. Outside, the loading bay had already become a scrum. Paparazzi, tipped off by the live on-air chaos, had swarmed the alley. Flashes exploded. Voices layered over each other, feral, hungry.</span></p><p><span>“There she is! Agatha, look here—”</span></p><p><span>“Is it true your security—”</span></p><p><span>“Who leaked the—”</span></p><p><span>One of them lunged too close to Agatha, the camera practically in her face. Rio ripped it from his hands and slammed it lens-first into the concrete. The crack was a gunshot. The crowd startled backward a step.</span></p><p><span>“Back up,” Natasha barked, voice like a whipcrack. She and Alice pushed the press line away with controlled force, bodies forming a wedge. “Back up. Now.”</span></p><p><span>They drove a narrow corridor through the chaos to the SUVs. Rio yanked open the rear door and guided Agatha inside, then slid in after her and slammed it shut. The car became a sanctuary of steel and leather and quick breaths. Outside, Natasha shoved the last of the cameras back, circled to the front, and dove into the passenger seat. Alice dropped behind the wheel.</span></p><p><span>“Go,” Rio said.</span></p><p><span>The tires squealed, then found purchase. The SUV shot forward, leaving shouts and flashes bleeding into the distance.</span></p><p><span>“Status,” Rio said into her mic, one arm wrapped protectively around Agatha’s shoulders.</span></p><p><span>“Kyra secured,” Bucky reported, breath a touch elevated but steady. Sirens wailed faintly in the background of his feed. “Yelena and I are exfiltrating her to a secondary site for questioning. Clint’s tailing in case Seren pops, and will escort Jen and Billy. Nat, send me the nearest clean room.”</span></p><p><span>“Sending coordinates,” Natasha said, already tapping into the shared map.</span></p><p><span>Alice took the next turn hard. “I’ve scrubbed the broadcast for replay. We killed their feed mid-cycle; not everything made air, but enough. Cicada wanted humiliation and chaos, classic signature. I’ve pulled what I can, but copies will be floating.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared down at her shaking hands as if they belonged to someone else. “They showed Wanda,” she whispered. “And Jen. And Lilia. That was my bedroom. They showed your dead team!” Her voice cracked, shuddering on the last word.</span></p><p><span>Rio tightened her hold. “I know.” She pitched her voice low, steady as bedrock. “I’m here. They didn’t get you now. They won’t get you again.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed hard and dragged her gaze up to meet Rio’s. “I can’t, if they hurt any of them—”</span></p><p><span>“They won’t,” Rio said, firm. “We’re already moving.”</span></p><p><span>Silence for a few breaths. The city flickered by in streaks of light. Agatha leaned into Rio, letting herself be held. The tremor in her fingers softened, not gone, but contained.</span></p><p><span>“Bucky,” Rio said, professional mask sliding back into place. “Keep Kyra breathing and talking. No cowboy moves. We do this clean.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky snorted softly. “Copy. I’ll save the cowboy for the encore.”</span></p><p><span>“Yelena?” Rio asked.</span></p><p><span>“Kyra is loud,” Yelena said dryly, fabric rustling as she adjusted a gag in Kyra’s mouth. “But zip ties are louder. We will make her sing.”</span></p><p><span>“Clint, any eyes on Seren?” Rio pressed.</span></p><p><span>“Negative so far,” Clint replied. “I’ve got the east exit and a rooftop view. If she moves, I’ll see it.”</span></p><p><span>Alice checked the rearview, jaw set. “I’m scrubbing entry logs for staff and guests. If Seren badged in or piggybacked, I’ll find the trace. Also, cross-referencing faces that avoided every camera sightline, classic ghosting behavior.”</span></p><p><span>“Good,” Rio said. “We pivot the op right now. Priority one, Agatha’s home. We switch vehicles twice, enter via the south gate. Nat, call Sonya and Steve—tight lock. No one in or out without your voice or mine.”</span></p><p><span>“Already done,” Natasha said, phone to her ear, efficient and calm.</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled slowly, the world still too loud, too bright. “I can’t believe they did that. On live TV.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes were flint. “They wanted to scare you. And to show they could touch what’s private.” She angled herself so Agatha wouldn’t have to see Alice’s grim, confirming nod in the mirror. “So we show them what happens when they touch what’s mine.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes flickered at the word—</span><em><span>mine.</span></em><span> Something steadied in her. “What happens?” she asked, voice small but fierce.</span></p><p><span>“We end this,” Rio said simply.</span></p><p><span>The SUV sped through the city, engine a low growl. For a while, the only sounds were the hum of the road and the quiet breath of a woman who refused to break.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Alice said carefully, eyes staying on the road, “I’ve already reached out to Wanda, Jen, and Lilia’s teams. We’re sweeping their places for bugs, rotating passwords, and pulling device logs. We’ll lock everything down before the hour’s out.”</span></p><p><span>“Thank you,” Agatha said, voice barely above a whisper.</span></p><p><span>“Press is exploding,” Natasha added, scrolling through her secure tablet. “But Peter’s people are cooperating. They’re cutting all footage of the breach. We’ll get a statement drafted that says the show suffered a technical issue and the taping was paused out of respect for safety.”</span></p><p><span>“Jessica Jones will want a quote,” Alice said. “We’ll coordinate with Jen before we give her anything.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded, then squeezed Agatha’s hand. “You don’t have to decide tonight. We’ll shield you from the noise. We’ll handle the legal and the technical. You just breathe.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded, the smallest of movements, but it mattered.</span></p><p><span>The SUV swung off the main artery and into the quieter veins of the city. Two blocks later, Alice pulled into an underground garage. They slid out, switched to a nondescript sedan waiting two levels down, then repeated the maneuver across town. Only when Rio was satisfied they’d shaken any eyes did they finally head for the hills.</span></p><p><span>“Home in ten,” Alice said.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tipped her head to rest on Rio’s shoulder, voice a rasp. “I hate that they saw me like that. I hate that they touched the people I love.”</span></p><p><span>Rio pressed a kiss to Agatha’s hairline, brief, hidden, just for them. “They didn’t touch who you are,” she said. “They never will.”</span></p><p><span>The gate to Agatha’s property opened on command. Sonya and Steve stood at attention just inside the drive, rifles slung, eyes sweeping. The sedan rolled to a stop beneath the portico. Doors opened in a practiced sequence—Natasha first, scanning; Alice next, popping the trunk; Rio last, guiding Agatha out with a palm at her back.</span></p><p><span>“House is sealed,” Steve reported. “No breaches. Perimeter clean.”</span></p><p><span>“Good,” Rio said. “We’re on high alert. No one sleeps until dawn.”</span></p><p><span>She angled Agatha toward the front door. The actress paused, fingers brushing Rio’s. “Don’t leave me tonight,” she said quietly.</span></p><p><span>“Never,” Rio answered, just as quiet.</span></p><p><span>Inside, the door shut with a soft, final click. The outside world, its cameras, its hunger, its cruelty, stayed on the other side of the wood.</span></p><p><span>For now.</span></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>Rio didn’t let go of Agatha’s hand as she steered her toward the living room. Natasha was already inside, phone pressed to her ear, her clipped Russian consonants snapping across the line. Alice had her laptop out on the dining table, cords snaking like veins as she hooked into the house’s systems. Steve and Sonya swept the perimeter one more time, their heavy boots a steady rhythm fading in and out.</span></p><p><span>Agatha moved like a sleepwalker, her hand still twined with Rio’s, her eyes glassy but sharp, clinging to control by sheer force of will. She sank onto the couch, tugging Rio down beside her like an anchor.</span></p><p><span>Alice broke the silence first, her fingers flying across keys. “It wasn’t us.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha turned, brows arched. “Define ‘wasn’t us.’”</span></p><p><span>“The breach. Those images? The files? They didn’t come from my system. They didn’t even touch the new security protocols.” Alice’s voice was tight.  “They clawed it all out of the </span><em><span>old</span></em><span> feeds. Pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. install. Everything Agatha’s last team ran? Compromised to hell. That’s where the Cicadas got in.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw flexed, fury flashing through her eyes. “You’re telling me the last team left a back door wide open, and nobody caught it?”</span></p><p><span>“Not a back door,” Alice corrected grimly, spinning her laptop to show grainy timestamps. “A vault left to rot. No maintenance, no purge cycles, no encryption updates. They left all of it sitting in a cloud server under a dead company name. Old feeds, cache files, storage snapshots. The Cicadas didn’t need to break in, they just scraped what was abandoned.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha buried her face in her hands, her voice muffled. “So every moment I thought was private… it was just sitting there, waiting for someone to weaponize it.”</span></p><p><span>Rio tightened her grip on Agatha’s wrist, firm but grounding. “They exploited negligence. Not your fault.”</span></p><p><span>Before Agatha could answer, the front door slammed open, and two voices cut through the heavy quiet.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha!”</span></p><p><span>Wanda barreled in first, hair wild, eyes bright with panic. Right behind her was Lilia, her face pale and pinched, fury simmering beneath the surface. Both women dropped their coats on the floor and rushed forward, ignoring Natasha’s raised brow from the doorway.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stood automatically, and Wanda pulled her into a crushing embrace. “Are you alright?!”</span></p><p><span>“I’m fine,” Agatha soothed, though her voice cracked. “Rio had me the whole time. I’m fine, I swear.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda pulled back just enough to look her over, as if scanning for wounds the rest of them had missed. Satisfied, she brushed hair back from Agatha’s face and kissed her forehead, muttering something in Sokovian under her breath.</span></p><p><span>Lilia didn’t move to hug her. She couldn’t. She was trembling, her hands fisted at her sides. “They didn’t just come after </span><em><span>you</span></em><span>,” she said hoarsely. Her eyes snapped to Rio, and for a terrifying second, the rage there wasn’t directed at the stalkers, it was directed at </span><em><span>her</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>“They had Colten’s photo. Classified mission data. Files the public should never have even known existed. How—” her voice broke, raw with grief she usually kept buried deep. “How do they have </span><em><span>my son’s name</span></em><span>? How do they have pictures of his dead body?!”</span></p><p><span>The room went still. Natasha lowered her phone. Alice stopped typing. Even Wanda froze.</span></p><p><span>Rio stood, shoulders squared, but her voice was low and steady, not defensive. “I don’t know yet. But I swear to you, Lilia, I will find out. Nobody touches Colten’s memory. Not like this.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s breath hitched, and she looked between them. “Wait, Colten? You mean—”</span></p><p><span>“My boy,” Lilia whispered, eyes glassy. “Rio’s teammate. My son.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nearly threw up, she didn’t actually get a good look at what was displayed on the screen, but she saw enough. She reached for Lilia’s hand, but the woman pulled back, not in anger at her but because she was shaking too badly. Wanda steadied her from behind, one arm circling her waist.</span></p><p><span>Alice’s voice cracked the silence again, quieter this time. “It wasn’t just Agatha. The Cicadas dumped fragments of military dossiers alongside the private photos. They don’t make sense, cut up and pieced together, but they’re authentic. Someone fed them intel, classified, real intel, and they mixed it in with the personal leaks to make it impossible to dismiss. They wanted the shock factor to land twice as hard.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha leaned against the mantel, arms folded. “So the question isn’t just ‘how did they get into Agatha’s old feeds.’ It’s: </span><em><span>who sold them military intel.</span></em><span> And why use it here, now?”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s face darkened, shadows under her eyes. “Because it ties me in. That intel was from my missions. My team. My past. They’re trying to weaken me while they shatter Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha reached out, grasping Rio’s hand tight, refusing to let her sink into guilt. “No. Don’t. This isn’t you. This is them twisting knives because they know where to cut deepest.”</span></p><p><span>Rio swallowed hard, staring down at their joined hands. She didn’t trust herself to answer.</span></p><p><span>Lilia finally sat, Wanda lowering her gently to the couch. She looked drained, her composure cracked in a way Agatha had rarely seen. “If they have Colten’s files, they have more. And if they’re willing to use him…” She trailed off, biting back a sob. “They’ll come after every ghost we’ve buried.”</span></p><p><span>Alice cleared her throat, forcing steel back into the conversation. “I traced the packets. The Cicadas used the same digital mark they always do, the insect sigil. But this wasn’t them alone. The smear campaign? That wasn’t their style. Too polished, too targeted. That was Renna’s hand. Raven’s still a ghost, but she’s circling this mess too. And now? Now we know someone with clearance-level access has joined their team. Somebody who could pull Colten’s file. It is possible the enforcer is former military and has access, or its possible its the work of the mastermind,” The weight of it pressed on the room.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s voice, when it came, was barely a whisper. “They’re everywhere. Aren’t they?”</span></p><p><span>Rio crouched in front of her, forcing her to look down, into her eyes. “No. They </span><em><span>want</span></em><span> you to believe that. But we’re closer than ever. We have Kyra in custody. We have Renna in our sights. We’ll dig Seren out, too. And whoever gave them classified files? We’ll find them. We’ll rip them into the light.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked, eyes shining with tears she refused to let fall. She searched Rio’s face, then finally let her hand rest against her jaw. “And what about you? They’re coming after you, too. They want to tear you apart with me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio covered her hand, pressing it closer to her cheek. “Then let them try. They’ll find I’m harder to break than they think.”</span></p><p><span>For the first time that night, Agatha let the tears slip. Wanda wrapped an arm around her shoulders from one side, Rio from the other, and Lilia sat across, fists still clenched but her eyes burning with something steadier now, not just rage, but resolve.</span></p><p><span>This wasn’t just about Agatha anymore. The stalkers had drawn blood from all of them.</span></p><p><span>And that meant all of them would fight back.</span></p><p><span>The house was quiet again, but only on the surface. Every phone on the table buzzed in a relentless, discordant chorus, alerts, calls, pings from social media. Jen finally snatched hers up, swiping furiously before tossing it down like it burned her.</span></p><p><span>“It’s everywhere,” she said flatly. “The leak. The broadcast. Every outlet from </span><em><span>Variety</span></em><span> to TMZ is spinning it. Twitter, TikTok, Instagram—#AgathaExposed, #PrayForAgatha, It’s wildfire.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha flinched at the words, Rio’s arm automatically tightening around her.</span></p><p><span>“All have been an outpouring support, but I need statements from all of you, Agatha, Rio, Wanda and Lilia. We need to get ahead of this,” Jen said sternly. Going though all of the articles and fan reactions flooding social media right now.</span></p><p><b>Variety: </b><em><span>Chaos on Live Television: Hackers Interrupt Talk Show With Leaked Files</span></em></p><p><em><span>Last night’s broadcast with Agatha Harkness and Peter Parker took a dark turn when hackers infiltrated the live feed, displaying private images and personal information belonging to Harkness, her security chief Rio Vidal, and close associates.

Then I’m meeting Bucky and Yelena to interrogate Kyra.”</span></p><p><span>She was already scrolling past the flood of notifications, thumb steady until she hit Maria Hill. She tapped speaker and set the phone on the table.</span></p><p><span>It rang once.</span></p><p><span>“Vidal,” Maria answered, awake and razor-sharp.</span></p><p><span>“Live breach on a network broadcast,” Rio said without preamble. “Cicadas pulled from Agatha’s </span><em><span>old</span></em><span> home feeds. They also surfaced classified mission fragments tied to my unit, including Colten, and my Delta team.” She glanced at Lilia; Lilia’s jaw trembled, but she nodded for Rio to continue. “Kyra Auden is in custody. Seren is still at large. We need a trace on who touched my file.”</span></p><p><span>A half-beat of silence, then Maria’s tone went flinty. “I’ll light a fire under the DIA. If this was an internal pull, we’ll see the audit trail. If it was a contractor or a leaker, we squeeze until they squeal.”</span></p><p><span>“Priority one,” Rio said. “Send me anyone we trust for a quiet chain-of-custody on the logs. I don’t want this contaminated.”</span></p><p><span>“Already in motion,” Maria replied. “You going to the black site?”</span></p><p><span>“Now.”</span></p><p><span>“Good. Send me your interview plan for Kyra and I’ll add questions. Don’t wait on me to start.” A pause. Softer: “You okay?”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes flicked to Agatha. “I will be.”</span></p><p><span>“Copy. I’ll circle back with names and the first cut of the access logs within the hour. Have Nat call me when she has a second.” The line clicked off.</span></p><p><span>Jen exhaled. “Okay. Timeline: statements drafted tonight, released at 9 a.m. Rio, you can give me a placeholder quote about cooperating with authorities and your commitment to protecting Agatha, then update once Maria confirms anything.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda stepped closer to Agatha, fingers lacing with hers. “Go,” she told Rio. “We’ve got her here.”</span></p><p><span>Rio looked to Agatha. The actress read the question on her face and squeezed her hand. “Go,” Agatha echoed, voice steadier than she felt.</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded once, then turned to Alice. “Package Kyra’s digital footprint. I want her known aliases, burner phones, past handle changes, crypto wallets, and any offsite storage. Anything that looks like a dead drop or a panic protocol.”</span></p><p><span>“On it,” Alice said, already typing.</span></p><p><span>“Nat,” Rio continued, “scrub tonight’s venue. Anyone who touched the broadcast system, security, A/V crew, temp hires. Cross-check with our watchlist and Renna’s known circles.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha was already shrugging into a jacket. “I’ll take Steve. Sonya holds the gate.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia rose, eyes wet but steely. “If Colten’s records were touched, I want names. When you have them, I want the first call.”</span></p><p><span>“You’ll get it,” Rio said, meeting her gaze without flinching.</span></p><p><span>She turned back to Agatha, stepping in close. For a heartbeat, the room faded. “I’ll check in when I reach Bucky and Yelena,” Rio promised, low and certain. “Lock the house. Stay on the inner cams. If anything feels off, you don’t argue, you move.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s mouth tipped into the smallest, fierce smile. “Yes, ma’am.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s dimples threatened; she tamped them down, kissed Agatha’s forehead, quick, grounding, and pulled away.</span></p><p><span>“Let’s roll,” she said to Natasha.</span></p><p><span>By the time the front door opened again, the team had already shifted like a living organism: Wanda and Lilia flanking Agatha, Jen at the table shaping language into shields, Alice a thunderstorm of keys and code, Sonya’s silhouette cutting across the hall as she moved to the east windows. The door thudded shut, and Rio’s footsteps faded down the porch.</span></p><p><span>War plan in motion.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>On the way to the warehouse, Rio’s phone buzzed sharp against the console. Maria’s name lit the screen. She answered on the second ring, voice clipped.</span></p><p><span>“Any news?” Rio asked, skipping pleasantries.</span></p><p><span>“We’ve confirmed the enforcer,” Maria said, her tone grim. “Maera Rourke. Former Army. She’s the one who dug into your files, and the one who took out Ralph. Ex-bodyguard of Agatha’s for a very brief stint, but now she’s mercenary muscle, takes contracts, no loyalty, no conscience. I’m sending you her dossier now. I’ll meet you at Agatha’s house when you’re done.”</span></p><p><span>The line went dead.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw tightened as her phone pinged with the incoming file. She opened it briefly, Maera’s photo stared back at her: sharp eyes, scars like unfinished sentences across her skin, the sort of face that had seen war and decided it preferred it. Cold. Ruthless.</span></p><p><span>Rio flicked the file to the rest of the team’s comms.</span></p><p><span>She pulled the SUV into the gravel lot outside the warehouse, engine humming low. The building loomed, dark windows, rust creeping up the siding, the kind of place no one asked questions about. Perfect for what they needed.</span></p><p><span>She killed the engine, silence settling like a weight. For a long moment, Rio just stared at the building, the faint flicker of the security light over the door. Then she exhaled and unbuckled.</span></p><p><span>Inside, there’d be no room for hesitation. Not with Kyra. Not with Maera’s shadow now hanging over them.</span></p><p><span>Rio shut the engine off, the gravel crackling one last time as the SUV settled into stillness.</span></p><p><span>The warehouse air was heavy, like dust and iron had seeped into its walls years ago and refused to leave. A single bulb swayed overhead, buzzing faintly, the shadows it cast moving like restless ghosts. Kyra Auden sat shackled to the table, chains rattling softly every time she shifted. And she shifted often. Too much energy in her small frame, like she might combust if left still for too long.</span></p><p><span>She was humming when the door opened. A lilting, off-key melody. Something that sounded like a lullaby but warped, broken.</span></p><p><span>Rio entered first. She didn’t slam the door or make a show of her presence. She just moved with deliberate calm, a predator’s silence. Yelena stalked in behind her, arms crossed tight, already looking irritated. Bucky shut the door last, his expression unreadable, a folder tucked under his arm.</span></p><p><span>Kyra’s grin stretched wide the second she saw them. “Well, well. Took you long enough. I was starting to wonder if you’re scared of me.”</span></p><p><span>“No one here is scared of you,” Yelena said flatly, leaning against the wall.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, kitten, you’ll forgive me if I don’t take you seriously. You’ve got the whole assassin vibe down, sure, but your eyes? They’re soft. Too soft.”</span></p><p><span>Yelena didn’t even blink. “Try me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio sat down across from Kyra. She didn’t waste words, didn’t rise to the bait. She just stared, and the silence stretched taut until even Kyra’s manic grin flickered.</span></p><p><span>Finally, Rio spoke. “You hum like you’re at peace. You’re not.”</span></p><p><span>Kyra chuckled. “Oh, I’m more than at peace. I’m winning. The world saw what we wanted them to see. You can patch it up with statements, with your pet journalist, with your fake smiles on talk shows, but the stain’s there. Agatha’s mine. She always was.”</span></p><p><span>“You don’t own her,” Rio said evenly.</span></p><p><span>Kyra’s eyes glittered. “Oh, soldier, everyone owns a piece of her. Fans, lovers, enemies. She’s carved up like a feast. We’re just the ones brave enough to take our share openly.”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t flinch, didn’t even let her breathing change. “Where’s Seren?”</span></p><p><span>The question made Kyra’s grin grow. She tilted her head, like a cat toying with prey. “Seren’s smarter than me. Faster. Quieter. She doesn’t need to get close. She’s the Cicada in the walls, in the wires. She can watch Agatha undress without ever stepping foot in the room. Want to know how many times she’s seen her vulnerable? Dozens. Hundreds. More than you ever will.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky stepped forward, sliding a photo onto the table. “And yet, you’re the one cuffed here, not her. Seren’s probably already figuring out how to cut you loose.”</span></p><p><span>Kyra’s laugh cracked like glass. “Seren won’t cut me loose. She needs me. She always has. I’m the mouth, she’s the hands. I’m the one who tells the story. She’s the one who writes it in code. Without me, she’s nothing but silence.”</span></p><p><span>“Without her, you’re nothing but noise,” Yelena countered, arms tightening across her chest.</span></p><p><span>Kyra snarled, jerking against the cuffs. “Don’t you dare. She’s brilliant. And she loves Agatha as much as I do.”</span></p><p><span>“Love?” Rio asked softly. “Is that what you call this?”</span></p><p><span>“It is love,” Kyra hissed. “Love is obsession. Love is pain. Love is knowing she owes you everything and still walking away. You’ll learn that too, soldier. When she leaves you the way she left me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes narrowed, but she didn’t speak.</span></p><p><span>Kyra leaned closer, chains clinking. “Oh, I know you. Rio Vidal. Hero. Soldier. Protector. Lover. And still, you couldn’t save them, could you? Your team. Valkyrie.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hands clenched against the table, the only sign she’d heard.</span></p><p><span>Kyra smiled slow, cruel. “I can still picture it. You holding her broken body. Wondering if maybe this time it was your fault. Wondering if loving her killed her. That’s what you do, Rio. You curse people by caring for them. Valkyrie, Colten, Your family, the rest of Delta”</span></p><p><span>Yelena slammed her boot into the table leg. The crack echoed like a gunshot. Kyra startled, but the smile snapped back almost instantly.</span></p><p><span>“Touch a nerve? Good.” Her voice dropped to a whisper, almost reverent. “Because that’s how it’ll end with Agatha too. She’ll choke on your love. And when she’s broken, when you’re grieving, we’ll pick up the pieces. She’ll finally come home.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky’s voice cut through the tension, calm but sharp. “You’re not the only piece in this. We know about Maera Rourke.” He dropped another photo on the table: a hard-eyed woman with cropped hair and a face carved in stone.</span></p><p><span>Kyra’s smirk faltered.</span></p><p><span>“Muscle for hire,” Rio said. “Ex-military. Former security. Worked for Agatha once. She doesn’t care about Agatha, doesn’t care about you. She only cares about the paycheck.”</span></p><p><span>Kyra tried to play bored, leaning back as the cuffs rattled. “So what? She gets the job done.”</span></p><p><span>“She killed Ralph,” Rio said, voice low. “Because he got sloppy. That’s not loyalty. That’s business. And when you become inconvenient, she’ll slit your throat too.”</span></p><p><span>Kyra bristled, mask cracking. “She’s not sloppy. She’s precise. She doesn’t ask questions. You want someone scared of blood? Go hire a nurse. You want someone who’ll burn down a house with the family still inside if that’s the contract? You call Maera.”</span></p><p><span>Yelena gave a mirthless laugh. “Sounds like a lovely companion. How proud you must be.”</span></p><p><span>Kyra glared at her. “She’s not my companion. She’s a tool. And she’s perfect.”</span></p><p><span>Rio watched her carefully. “So Maera’s the hammer. Seren’s the hands. You’re the mouth. But there’s still more.”</span></p><p><span>Kyra froze, ever so slightly.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned in, quiet, steady. “The Rat. The one who got into Agatha’s trailer. Rigged the light. Left the note. That wasn’t you, wasn’t Seren, wasn’t Maera or Renna. That was someone else.”</span></p><p><span>Kyra’s lips parted, and for a split second she looked startled, like a rabbit caught in headlights. Then she laughed, too loud, too forced. “Rat. That’s cute. Maybe you’re smarter than you look.”</span></p><p><span>“So there is another,” Bucky pressed.</span></p><p><span>Kyra tilted her head, feigning amusement, but her eyes were wild. “Oh, the Rat is special. She slinks in where no one notices. Crawls under doors, through cracks. She doesn’t need fame or fire. She just wants to watch Agatha bleed up close. Personal. Intimate.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s stomach tightened, but her face stayed still. “And the Watcher,” she said softly.</span></p><p><span>Kyra froze again.</span></p><p><span>“You didn’t mean to,” Rio continued. “But you’ve mentioned someone else too. Someone always close, always lingering.”</span></p><p><span>Kyra’s smile wavered. Then it returned, sharper, jagged. “The Watcher… she’s always there. A shadow at the edge of the crowd. A whisper outside the window. Agatha doesn’t even see her, but she sees everything. Every smile. Every tear. Every touch she’s given you.”</span></p><p><span>Yelena’s lip curled. “Creepy.”</span></p><p><span>“She’s devoted,” Kyra whispered. “More devoted than me. And when the time comes, she’ll be the knife at Agatha’s throat while the rest of you blink.”</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned forward, her voice a low growl. “And the mastermind?”</span></p><p><span>Kyra went still. Too still. Her grin faltered, and for the first time, her eyes darted away.</span></p><p><span>Kyra’s jaw trembled. “She’s… untouchable.”</span></p><p><span>“No one’s untouchable,” Bucky said.</span></p><p><span>Kyra snapped back to life, slamming her hands against the table, chains rattling. “You don’t understand! She’s everything. She’s the beginning and the end. She loved Agatha. Hated her. Built her up. Tore her down. And she’ll finish what she started. You can’t stop her. You can’t even name her.”</span></p><p><span>“She’s using you,” Yelena spat.</span></p><p><span>Kyra laughed, a broken, wild sound. “Let her use me. At least she sees me. At least she loves me in her way. That’s more than Agatha ever did.”</span></p><p><span>Her gaze snapped to Rio then, sharp as a blade. “And you, she’ll leave you too. Just like she left me. Because that’s who Agatha Harkness is. She destroys everything she touches.”</span></p><p><span>“Congrats on getting farther then the rest, You’ve named the Fox, the Crow, the Cicadas and the coyote, but you haven’t found the Rat or the Snake. And they have some of the worst bites.” The bulb overhead buzzed louder, casting Kyra’s face in jagged light and shadow. Her grin was all teeth, her eyes all madness.</span></p><p><span>Rio stood, gathering the photos from the table with deliberate care. Her voice, when it came, was quiet but lethal. “You’ve told us more than you think.”</span></p><p><span>Kyra leaned back, chains scraping, humming that broken lullaby again. “And you’ve heard less than you need.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky opened the door, his face grim. Yelena shot one last look back at Kyra, disgust curling her lip, then followed Rio out.</span></p><p><span>Kyra’s laugh followed them down the hall, high and unhinged. “She’ll never be yours. She’ll always be ours!”</span></p><p><span>The door shut on her voice, but the echo lingered long after.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The convoy rolled back into Agatha’s property just as the horizon bled into twilight. The gates clanged shut behind them, Sonya and Steve resuming their positions like statues. Rio parked with deliberate calm, though her knuckles were pale on the wheel. The warehouse stench of fear and defiance still clung to her, Kyra’s manic laughter echoing in her ears.</span></p><p><span>Inside the house, the atmosphere was taut. Agatha, wrapped in a silk robe the color of midnight, sat curled on the couch with Wanda at her side. Lilia hovered nearby, arms folded, her sharp eyes flicking to every movement like she was cataloguing threats herself. Billy and Jen lingered behind the couch, their protective instincts so obvious they could’ve been carrying sidearms of their own.</span></p><p><span>Maria was already there, speaking quietly with Natasha by the fireplace. They stood close, Natasha’s hand brushing Maria’s wrist as she passed her a folder, Maria’s expression softening just briefly in response. Subtle, but anyone with eyes could see the tether between them.</span></p><p><span>When Rio entered with Yelena and Bucky, the room seemed to hold its breath.</span></p><p><span>Agatha immediately straightened. “Well? Tell me it wasn’t for nothing.” Her voice was steady, but her fingers twisted the hem of her robe.</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded once, signaling for Yelena and Bucky to take their places before she began. She shed her coat, laying the folder Maria had given her on the coffee table, and leaned forward against the edge. Every face was on her.</span></p><p><span>“We got more than we hoped,” Rio said, her tone clipped but sure. “Kyra was slippery, but we forced cracks in her act. Here’s what we know.”</span></p><p><span>She tapped the folder, flipping it open to reveal hastily printed dossiers. “They’re working under codenames. Animals. Each with distinct roles.”</span></p><p><span>Yelena smirked faintly, leaning against the wall. “Like some twisted petting zoo.”</span></p><p><span>“First,” Rio continued, ignoring her, “The Fox. Renna. She’s behind the PR sabotage and online smear campaigns. The sudden hashtags, the fake testimonies, the deepfakes? That’s her. And she’s good at it. Personal. Calculated. She wants the world to turn on you, Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s jaw tensed, but she only nodded, as if she’d expected Renna to still be haunting her.</span></p><p><span>“Second, The Crow. Raven.” Rio’s eyes flicked briefly to Agatha. “Kyra slipped, mentioned that the Crow watches everything. We believe Raven is also the Watcher. The one tailing you in public. Blending into crowds. Always close, but never caught. She sees, she records, she feeds it back to the others.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed hard. Wanda’s hand found hers, a quiet anchor.</span></p><p><span>“Third, the Rat.” Rio’s voice lowered, deliberate. “This one’s the infiltrator. They were the one who got into your trailer, wrecked your mirror, chewed your mail, left the note. They also rigged the light on set. Sabotage, up close and personal. But Kyra didn’t give us an identity. Just the codename.”</span></p><p><span>Jen muttered under her breath. “Fitting.”</span></p><p><span>“Fourth, the Snake. The mastermind,” Rio continued. “The one pulling all the strings, paying for it all, tying the rest together. Kyra confirmed it’s a woman. She refused to say who, but, ” Rio’s gaze shifted back to Agatha. “she said you know her.”</span></p><p><span>The silence that followed was thick, pressing. Agatha stiffened, then exhaled, looking away toward the fire. “Of course I do.”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t push. Not yet.</span></p><p><span>“Fifth, the Coyote. The enforcer. Maera Rourke.” She slid a photo across the table, Maera’s scarred face staring up at them. “Former Army. Ex-bodyguard. Now a mercenary for hire. She killed Ralph Bohner when he became a liability. She doesn’t care about you, Agatha, she only cares about finishing a contract and getting paid. Ruthless. Efficient. She’ll do anything including getting into my Miltary records and giving them to the Cicada’s.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia stepped closer, peering at the photo. Her lips pressed thin, the lines around her eyes hardening. “She worked for us once. I didn’t trust her then. I should’ve—”</span></p><p><span>“This isn’t on you,” Rio cut her off gently.</span></p><p><span>Bucky’s gravelly voice rumbled as he leaned forward. “Maera doesn’t leave loose ends. If she’s on payroll, we need to assume she’s capable of escalation. And if she’s got a personal history with Agatha, she knows routines, tells, even habits that make her dangerous.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes lingered on the photo longer than she wanted. She remembered Maera’s presence, stone-faced, detached, a shadow that never smiled. It chilled her, even now.</span></p><p><span>“And lastly,” Rio finished, “the Cicadas. Hackers. Kyra and Seren Auden. Sisters. We’ve confirmed their handles and their signature, the cicada motif buried in their code. They’re responsible for hacking old security systems, pulling your private photos, leaking them. They started as fans. Built projects, ran accounts you once acknowledged. Then you stopped engaging. They twisted that into resentment. They convinced themselves you owed them your career.”</span></p><p><span>Alice, listening intently, added, “Their hacks all carry the same digital signature. I can track it. We’ll be able to find Seren soon.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s hand tightened around Agatha’s. “So it’s all women. Every one of them.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded grimly. “Yes. Every one of them has some history—direct or indirect—with Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>The room fell quiet. The fire crackled softly. Outside, the security lights buzzed.</span></p><p><span>Jen finally broke the silence, her voice low but fierce. “This is insane. These women aren’t fans, they’re predators. They built an identity around tearing her apart.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at the photo of Maera, then the folder of Kyra’s twisted scrawlings, before finally closing it with a snap. Her voice, when it came, was raw but steady. “I can handle people hating me. I’ve lived with it before. What I can’t, what I won’t handle is them coming after the people I love. That’s where I draw the line.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s gaze softened at her. She reached out, briefly covering Agatha’s hand on the folder. A silent vow.</span></p><p><span>Maria finally stepped forward, her presence commanding. “Then we draw our own lines. We’ve identified nearly all of them: the Fox, the Crow, the Rat, the Snake, the Coyote, the Cicadas. We’ll dismantle them piece by piece. But we need to be smart, coordinated, and faster than they are. No mistakes.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha slid a hand briefly against Maria’s back before stepping forward herself. “They think they can circle Agatha like vultures. Let’s show them what happens when they pick the wrong prey.”</span></p><p><span>A grim smile ghosted across Wanda’s face at that. “Let them try.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s chest tightened at the solidarity in the room. For the first time since the nightmare began, she felt something sharper than fear: the faint, burning edge of hope.</span></p><p><span>“I say, since we know most of these people’s names and faces, we release them to the public. Let Agatha’s real fans, her coven help us. They’ll be more eyes in the audience for us. We can include that in all of your statements, asking for the public’s help,” Jen offered, her tone practical but sharp, like she’d already started drafting headlines in her head.</span></p><p><span>“That could work,” Alice agreed almost immediately, arms crossed as her analytical gaze swept across the group. “Let the media and public be our eyes and ears. Your fans, the normal ones love you, Agatha. They want to see you safe. If we mobilize them, it puts the stalkers on notice. They won’t be able to move in the shadows if the whole world is looking for them.”</span></p><p><span>Every eye shifted to Rio. She stood still at the edge of the table, jaw tight, weighing it. Her instinct screamed against letting civilians play watchdog in something this dangerous. But she also knew Alice and Jen were right: the stalkers thrived on silence, secrecy, shadows. Dragging them into the light would cut away that advantage.</span></p><p><span>Finally, she gave a short, decisive nod. “Alright. Let’s draft up the statements now. The sooner we put their faces and names out there, the better.”</span></p><p><span>Jen clapped her hands once, already tugging her laptop free from its case. “Perfect. Agatha, you’ll have to give me direct quotes. Rio, Lilia, Wanda, you too, your credibility will go a long way here. We frame it not as panic, but as empowerment. These women aren’t fans, they’re criminals. And criminals don’t deserve silence.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shifted in her seat, her robe drawn tight around her like armor. She tilted her head, a wry smile tugging at her lips despite the exhaustion in her eyes. “You want me to call my coven to arms.”</span></p><p><span>Jen’s fingers were already flying over the keyboard, but she looked up long enough to smirk. “Exactly. And trust me, they’ll answer.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia spoke then, her voice low but firm, carrying that maternal edge she always used with Agatha. “Just be careful in how it’s worded, Jennifer. If you make it sound like open season, we’ll have a thousand self-appointed vigilantes running around. Keep it measured. Focused.”</span></p><p><span>“Of course,” Jen said, nodding briskly. “We’ll release official images of Renna, Raven, Maera, and Seren. Confirm their past roles regarding Agatha. Emphasize that any information should go directly to authorities or to us, not handled personally.”</span></p><p><span>“Good,” Rio said. She leaned down slightly, resting her palms flat on the table, her voice brooking no argument. “The last thing we need is someone getting themselves hurt trying to play hero. These women are violent, trained, and organized. Fans can watch, they can tip us off, but no one approaches them. That’s non-negotiable.”</span></p><p><span>Maria added, calm but commanding, “And we’ll coordinate with our government contacts to make sure any tips filter back to us immediately. Information is power. Right now, it’s the best weapon we have.”</span></p><p><span>The room hummed with a strange energy, Determination and adrenaline</span></p><p><span>Agatha reached out, her hand brushing Rio’s on the table. “Then let’s do it. If they want to make me a symbol, let’s use it against them. They’ve stolen enough. Time we take something back.”</span></p><p><span>Rio covered her hand with her own, steady and grounding, before straightening. “Then it’s decided.”</span></p><p><span>Jen cracked her knuckles and grinned, her screen already glowing with half-written drafts. “Let’s make history.”</span></p><h3><b>Agatha’s Statement </b></h3><p><em><span>My Coven,</span></em></p><p><em><span>Over the past weeks, I’ve been targeted by a coordinated group calling themselves The Seventh Veil.

<p><span>The next morning, Agatha woke wrapped securely in strong arms, cocooned against a body that radiated steady warmth. She shifted slightly, trying to ease herself free, but Rio instinctively tightened her hold, pulling her closer.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stilled. She had never once woken before Rio; her soldier was always up before dawn, sharp and alert, already moving through the day with precision. But this morning, Rio slept on, her breath slow and even, her face softened in a way Agatha rarely got to see.</span></p><p><span>For a long, unhurried moment, Agatha let herself simply look. Rio wore her usual nighttime uniform, sweatpants, and a sports bra, practical even in rest. But stripped of her armor, her walls, she looked impossibly gentle. Agatha reached up and traced her thumb along the line of Rio’s strong jaw, marveling at the stillness, at the peace carved into her features as if the world outside, stalkers, chaos, fear, didn’t exist.</span></p><p><span>Her chest ached with it. She swore she fell more in love every single day. They hadn’t said the words aloud yet, but the truth hummed between them, unspoken and undeniable. And Agatha thought, with sudden clarity, that it was time. Time to give those feelings a voice, to tell her soldier exactly how deep they ran.</span></p><p><span>Rio stirred at last, lashes fluttering open. She blinked herself awake, groggy and unguarded, and when her gaze landed on Agatha, a slow, soft smile spread across her lips.</span></p><p><span>“I hope you slept well, hermosa,” Rio murmured, her voice thick with sleep, warm and rasping like gravel smoothed by velvet. “You need it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stretched, reluctantly peeling herself out of Rio’s arms before she could be pulled back in again. “If I stay here, I’m never getting up,” she teased, pushing her curls out of her face.</span></p><p><span>Rio sat up slowly, running a hand through her sleep-mussed hair. Even half awake, she radiated discipline, though Agatha could see the shadows under her eyes. Rio hadn’t truly rested in weeks, and yesterday’s ambush had only added to the weight she carried.</span></p><p><span>“You look tired,” Agatha said softly, pulling one of Rio’s T-shirts over her head. “And don’t give me the ‘I’m fine’ speech, darling. Not after everything yesterday.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s lips twitched. “I was going to say I’m functional. Which is true. But…” Her gaze dropped for a moment, then lifted again, steady. “I hated that you had to go through that live. Having your privacy torn open in front of millions—that should never have happened.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha crossed to her, cupping Rio’s cheek in her hand. “And yet, you were there. You got me out. You kept me safe. That’s what I’ll remember.” She leaned down and pressed a soft kiss to Rio’s temple. “We’ll get through this. Together.”</span></p><p><span>For the first time that morning, Rio allowed herself to nod. “Together.”</span></p><p><span>They dressed quickly and headed downstairs. The scent of strong coffee and something frying drifted from the kitchen. The murmur of voices grew louder as they rounded the corner.</span></p><p><span>Natasha was at the stove, sleeves rolled up, flipping eggs with military precision. Maria sat at the table scrolling through her phone, her reading glasses perched on her nose, while Lilia whispered something to Wanda that made her shake her head with a rare smile. Billy was already halfway through a plate of toast, eyes bleary but loyal as ever.</span></p><p><span>Alice had her laptop propped open on the counter, multiple feeds running. She glanced up when Agatha and Rio walked in. “Morning. You two sleep?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked. “Define sleep.”</span></p><p><span>That earned her a chuckle from Clint, who was leaning against the fridge with a mug in hand. “I regret asking.”</span></p><p><span>Jen breezed in right on cue, tablet in one hand, her hair pulled up into a messy bun that screamed she hadn’t stopped working since the night before. “Oh, trust me, none of us are sleeping after yesterday. And you two—” she gestured between Agatha and Rio “—can save your blushes, because we’ve got bigger problems.”</span></p><p><span>Rio arched a brow, arms crossing. “Bigger than what already happened?”</span></p><p><span>Jen dropped the tablet on the table with a loud </span><em><span>thunk</span></em><span>. “Tips. Hundreds of them. My inbox is overflowing, my voicemail is maxed out, and every fan forum looks like a conspiracy board exploded. Your statements worked, people are combing through old photos, event clips, and even airport footage. They’re convinced they’ve spotted members of the Salem Seven everywhere from a coffee shop in Burbank to a dog show in Cleveland.”</span></p><p><span>Billy perked up, toast still hanging from his mouth. “Wait, a dog show?”</span></p><p><span>Jen gave him a look. “Yes. And before you ask, no, I don’t think the Salem Seven are moonlighting as poodle groomers. But mixed in with the noise are some solid leads, especially on Renna and Raven.”</span></p><p><span>Alice leaned forward, interest sparking. “What kind of leads?”</span></p><p><span>“Photos, mostly. A handful of fans dug up older convention pics, where Renna is lurking in the background near Agatha’s table. Someone else sent in a blurry shot from two weeks ago that looks an awful lot like Raven at LAX.” Jen scrolled with a swipe of her finger. “And then there’s Maera. Military circles are buzzing online; apparently, her name has come up in forums tied to mercenary work in Eastern Europe. It lines up with what we already know.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s stomach twisted, though she forced a steady tone. “And the media?”</span></p><p><span>Jen winced. “Well, they’re having a field day. Headlines are calling this ‘Hollywood’s Real-Life Witch Hunt.’ The leak of your photos was bad, but the statements turned the tide. Most outlets are leaning sympathetic now, Jessica Jones’ piece keeps getting cited, and Lilia’s words about Colten hit hard. People are furious on your behalf.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia, seated at the far end of the table, nodded firmly. “Good. They should be.”</span></p><p><span>“And the fans?” Rio asked.</span></p><p><span>Jen’s expression softened slightly. “They’re rallying. Hashtags like #StandWithAgatha and #ShieldHer are trending. Rio, you’ve got your own fanbase now—#RioVidal has over half a million posts. Some are just…thirsty,” she shot Agatha a dry look, “but most are people calling you a hero. The same goes for the rest of the team. You’re being painted as this unstoppable unit, and honestly? That’s good for us. Public pressure makes it harder for the Seven to hide.”</span></p><p><span>Alice whistled low. “Crowd sourcing manhunts. I like it.”</span></p><p><span>“Careful,” Natasha cut in, her voice even but sharp. “Public eyes are useful, but they’re not trained. If fans start thinking they can intervene, it could get someone killed.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded in agreement, her hand brushing briefly against Agatha’s shoulder in silent reassurance. “We’ll filter everything through us first. Nothing gets acted on without verification.”</span></p><p><span>Jen exhaled, rubbing at her temple. “Good. Because if one more fan emails me saying they’re ‘positive’ they saw Renna buying laundry detergent at Target, I might actually scream.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed softly despite herself, breaking some of the tension. “Well, darling, I suppose everyone needs clean socks. Even stalkers.”</span></p><p><span>That earned a chuckle from Wanda, though her grip on Agatha’s hand remained firm. The humor was needed, but the weight in the room was undeniable.</span></p><p><span>Agatha pulled out her phone and read some of the reactions.</span></p><p><b>Variety</b><span>: </span><em><span>“Agatha Harkness Breaks Silence: Names Members of Alleged Stalker Ring ‘Seventh Veil’ in Personal Statement”</span></em><em><span><br/><br/></span></em></p><p><b>Hollywood Reporter</b><span>: </span><em><span>“From Smear Campaigns to Leaked Photos: Harkness, Team, and Family Issue Strong United Front”</span></em><em><span><br/><br/></span></em></p><p><b>Buzzfeed</b><span>: </span><em><span>“Agatha’s Manager Lilia Calderu Condemns Exploitation of Late Son’s Image: ‘His memory is sacred’”</span></em><em><span><br/><br/></span></em></p><p><b>Deadline</b><span>: </span><em><span>“S.H.I.E.L.D.

I think they’re from the Seven.” Agatha’s voice was sharp with shock as she held up her phone.</span></p><p><span>“Let me see.” Rio’s hand was steady as she took the phone from Agatha, her eyes narrowing as she scanned the screen.</span></p><p><span>Jen was already pulling out her own phone, fingers flying across the screen as she tried to find the same posts. “If they’re on public feeds, they won’t stay buried long. The press will pick them up in minutes if they haven’t already.”</span></p><p><span>The rest of the team leaned in, their faces hardening as the mocking words glared back at them in black and white. The room, once filled with the faint hum of morning conversation, felt suddenly heavy, every breath sharper, every sound louder.</span></p><p><b>@CicadaSong: </b><em><span>You call us criminals, but we’re the ones who made you unforgettable.

Rio pulled a tablet into view and turned it so everyone around the kitchen table could see the layout of the plaza where the pop-up meet-and-greet would take place. Her voice was calm, measured, the kind that cut through panic and shaped it into purpose.</span></p><p><span>“Listen up,” she said. “We bait them. They want to be seen. They want attention. We give them a stage, but it’s one we control.”</span></p><p><span>She tapped the screen. A satellite map filled the display, red lines and shaded zones marking sightlines and exits. “This is a small public plaza downtown. It’s a low-key venue, single entry, one main exit, and side alleys that we can seal off. Jen will announce a short, unscheduled ‘surprise’ meet-and-greet with Agatha. The goal: draw a crowd, but keep it manageable.”</span></p><p><span>Jen, already mentally sprinting, nodded. “We frame it as gratitude. ‘I refuse to be silenced. Come say hi.’ Fans will show. They’ll love it. The media will swarm, and honestly, that’s good; pressure lowers their patience.”</span></p><p><span>Rio continued. “We’re not walking into this blind. Maria and I have already approved an undercover detail. SHIELD will plant operatives in the crowd disguised as fans, concession workers, even photographers. We’ll also have plainclothes local law enforcement interspersed, uniformed officers only at the perimeter to avoid spooking genuine fans.” She pointed to a ring of blue on the map. “Bucky and Clint will hold far perimeter positions with overwatch. Natasha and Yelena will be closer, embedded in the crowd with comms. Alice will monitor all camera feeds and social chatter in real time.”</span></p><p><span>Alice’s fingers flew over her own laptop. “I’ve already set up facial recognition filters on the plaza’s camera network and a dozen high-traffic feeds. If any of the Seven appear, I’ll flag them instantly and push images to every agent’s HUD.”</span></p><p><span>Yelena smirked, tying her gloves on. “If Renna wants attention, we’ll give her fifteen minutes of it, in custody. I’m looking forward to the chase.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s plan was surgical. “We’ll stage two decoy entrances. Fans with confirmed RSVPs go through the main gate, where we screen IDs and run quick electronics checks. Any red flags, unknown luggage, or blocked cameras, they will go through a secondary screening. The other entrance will be for the press, escorted and monitored. We will not allow unscreened access.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia, who’d been quiet until now, leaned forward. “And what about safe extraction? If things go sideways and the crowd surges…”</span></p><p><span>“We won't allow an environment that could create crowd surges,” Rio said flatly. “Controlled entry, limited tickets, metal detectors at both gates. But contingency is vital: we’ll have an extraction corridor, a neutral walkway we keep clear from the press side to the private exit. If we get a positive ID on Renna, Raven, or any other known member of the Seven, we move through the corridor. Local units will close the outer ring instantly to prevent interference. Medical will be staged two blocks away and ready.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha watched the plan like a general reading a battle map, her fingers braided in her lap. “You’re setting a trap,” she said quietly.</span></p><p><span>“A trap with a lot of backup,” Rio replied. “Not a stunt.” Her eyes softened when they landed on Agatha. “You’re not walking that line alone. We’ll be there, physically and legally. Jen, make sure the announcement doesn’t include precise timings or full location details. We want enough interest to draw them, but not enough to spawn copycats.”</span></p><p><span>“Copy that,” Jen said, already drafting a short, controlled post in her head. “We’ll push the narrative: Agatha refuses to hide. Come for a showing of support, but we’ll ask everyone to behave and use official channels for tips.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky, arms folded, growled softly. “If one person gets hurt because some keyboard warrior wanted to be a hero, I will personally—”</span></p><p><span>“You won’t have to,” Rio cut in. “We control the field. We control the exits. And no one engages suspects without backup present. That includes fans.” Her voice wasn’t harsh; it was final.</span></p><p><span>They all understood the stakes. The Seven had escalated from digital taunts to physical sabotage. Renna and Raven were the two pieces they needed to remove from the board. Capture them here, under the bright gaze of the public and press, and the group’s anonymity and structure would fracture.</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a long breath and met Rio’s eyes. “If this works,” she said, “we get answers.”</span></p><p><span>“If it doesn’t,” Rio said, closing the tablet and standing, “we adapt. But we make it work.”</span></p><p><span>There was a taut silence, then a chorus of agreements. Jen finalized the message, Alice isolated the feed filters, Natasha and Yelena checked their kits, and Maria coordinated with local law enforcement contacts. Agatha sat taut but steady, flanked by the people who would move heaven to protect her.</span></p><p><span>Outside, the city carried on, ignorant and bright. Inside the kitchen, the map on the table felt like a spearhead pointing out from their quiet house, small and decisive, aiming to cut the Seven’s shadow down to size.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The plaza looked smaller in person than it had on Rio’s tablet, an open stone square cupped between brick buildings and a row of sycamores, with a single gated entry funneled through stanchions and a second, narrower lane for press escorts. Food carts flanked the far side, the sweet sting of kettle corn drifting over the low hum of a growing crowd. It smelled like city heat and sugar and nerves.</span></p><p><span>By the time Agatha’s SUV rolled to a stop at the service alley entrance, the place was already a sea of purple scarves and handmade signs. The announcement had been careful, no exact time, no map pin, but it didn’t matter. Word of mouth had done its work. Fans were lined up two blocks deep, and even the press kept to their penned lane under the watch of uniformed officers lounging like disinterested cats with very sharp claws.</span></p><p><span>“Final comms check,” Rio said softly, sliding her earpiece into place. “Alpha team?”</span></p><p><span>“North roof, eyes on,” Clint replied. “Glass glare is rough, but I’ve got the press lane and the crowd’s right flank.”</span></p><p><span>“West alley,” Bucky said. “Two blocks out. If someone bolts, I’ll be their problem.”</span></p><p><span>“Embedded in crowd,” Natasha added, her voice low-throated and calm. “Section B, left of the stage, third row.”</span></p><p><span>“Section D, vendor side,” Yelena chimed. “Pretending to buy a stale pretzel. Terrible choice.”</span></p><p><span>“In the van, backline,” Alice said. “City camera grid is mine. Facial-rec spun up, Renna, Raven, Maera, and the Cicadas are hot-listed. I’ll ping if I get a hit. Also, searching hashtags in real time.”</span></p><p><span>“Local units?” Rio asked.</span></p><p><span>Maria answered from the command tent they’d erected behind the stage, clipboard tucked under her arm like a ceremonial sword. “Six plainclothes inside the crowd, four in the press, two medics posted in the alley. The chief owes me three favors. Today I’m cashing two.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smoothed her jacket and took a breath she hoped would reach the soles of her feet. “You all look like you’re going to war,” she murmured, half to herself.</span></p><p><span>“We are,” Wanda said quietly from behind her, the hand on Agatha’s shoulder both anchor and promise.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s gaze swept the plaza one last time. “We control the ground,” she said. “We control the exits. We do not improvise unless we have to. Agatha?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked at her. “I won’t wander. I won’t play hero. If you say move, I move.”</span></p><p><span>They stepped out into a roar that rattled the sycamores. The crowd pressed forward, then held, restrained by metal and good sense and the men in blue. Phones lifted like a field of stars. Agatha lifted a hand, smiling, and the volume shifted from wild to warm.</span></p><p><span>“Hey, Coven,” she called into the mic Jen thrust at her, voice steadying in the space that had been hers since she was a teenager. “I said I wouldn’t hide. So… hi.” Laughter rolled back to her like surf. “We’re keeping this short and safe. We’ve got a quick line for photos and hellos, and then I have to get back to work. But I wanted to see you. Thank you for showing up, for me, and for each other.”</span></p><p><span>She stepped down from the riser to the small rope-chute they’d built, flanked by Rio on the right and Maria two steps back. Fans came through one by one; teary, shaking, grinning, gruff. She signed posters, books, and a witch's hat. She posed for photos, brushed off apologies with jokes, and kept her breathing even.</span></p><p><span>After ten minutes, Jen lifted a hand; time to rotate. Rio touched Agatha’s elbow, and she pivoted smoothly. The crowd was a sea of faces and lenses, forgettable until someone wasn’t.</span></p><p><span>“Facial match seventy percent, left side, press lane, blonde with sunglasses,” Alice said in their ears. “Adjusting angle… ninety-one percent. Raven Corvin. Tagging feed.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s her,” Clint confirmed from above. “Press queue, second row. Black blazer, white tee, credential lanyard. She’s wearing a photographer’s vest.”</span></p><p><span>“Copy,” Rio said calmly, letting none of the adrenaline leak into her tone. “Natasha, you’re lead.”</span></p><p><span>“Moving,” Natasha replied. Her path through the bodies was a ballet of shoulders and apologies. She slipped into the press line and slid up alongside the blonde, close enough to share perfume. Raven’s mouth trembled, amusement? Fear? Her hand slid deeper into the vest pocket.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t,” Natasha said, voice pitched so low only Raven could hear. “Hands where I can see them.”</span></p><p><span>Raven lifted her chin instead. “You’re prettier in person.”</span></p><p><span>“Hands,” Natasha repeated.</span></p><p><span>Something flickered in Raven’s eyes, calculation, maybe, or an old habit of charming her way out of corners. She turned her palms up, empty. Natasha moved as if stretching, and the line shifted with her. In a heartbeat, there were two plainclothes at Raven’s shoulders and an officer moving a barricade to create a pocket of space that looked, to most eyes, like a routine adjustment.</span></p><p><span>“We’ve got her,” Natasha said, slipping the zip-tie on so fast it might have been a magic trick. Raven didn’t struggle. She smiled, slow and strange.</span></p><p><span>“Tell Agatha I loved her first,” she said, eyes wandering toward the stage. “Tell her to look at me.”</span></p><p><span>“Not a chance,” Natasha murmured, and signaled the extraction. Raven was taken into the side alley before most of the cameras realized anything had happened.</span></p><p><span>The cheer shifted; news of something moving in the press lane rippled across the plaza on the backs of whispers and phones. Rio kept her expression neutral and her body loose.</span></p><p><span>“Alice,” she said, “mass text the interior team: stay steady, stay smiling, no other moves unless we have a lock. We don’t spook the fish while we have one in the net.”</span></p><p><span>“Copy,” Alice said, and then her voice sharpened. “New ping. Left flank, fan section—row five, purple scarf, baseball cap. Renna. Eighty-eight percent match, rising. She’s watching Agatha, not her phone. She’s—yeah. Ninety-six percent match. Rio, that’s her.”</span></p><p><span>“I see her,” Clint said, the lens whirring in his tone. “She’s twitchy. Looking for cameras.”</span></p><p><span>“Yelena?” Rio asked.</span></p><p><span>“Already on my way,” Yelena replied, abandoning the stale pretzel without regret. “Do we want to take her quietly or loudly?”</span></p><p><span>“Quiet, if we can. Loud if we must,” Rio said.</span></p><p><span>Agatha was two fans away from the end of the segment when a woman at the barricade turned, eyes wide, and shouted toward the line of black suits. “Rio! It’s her! The blonde—the one from the posts!” She pointed, frantic, pulling at the sleeve of the girl next to her. “There! The cap!”</span></p><p><span>For a split second, the sound changed, the tone tilting like a glass set down too hard. Renna flinched, head snapping toward the cry. And then she bolted.</span></p><p><span>“Runner,” Clint barked. “Left flank, moving north toward the alley behind the coffee cart.”</span></p><p><span>“On it,” Yelena said, launching after her with a flurry of motion that made speed look like the most natural thing in the world.</span></p><p><span>“Bucky, cut her off at the second alley,” Rio said, already moving. “Agatha, with me.” She turned, and for a half breath, Agatha’s eyes clung to hers, fear, anger, resolve, and then she handed her mic to Jen and stepped back into the shadow of two agents who appeared as if conjured.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve got Agatha,” Maria confirmed. “We’re taking her to the corridor.”</span></p><p><span>And then Rio was running.</span></p><p><span>The alley smelled like fry oil and wet cardboard, the ground slick with something sticky. Renna’s cap flashed and vanished between service doors. Yelena’s braid snapped like a whip as she cut the corner. Bucky emerged from the cross street like a wall that had learned to move.</span></p><p><span>“Stop!” he barked. Renna juked hard right. Bucky swore and sprang after her.</span></p><p><span>They hit the sidewalk, and the city opened—horns, bikes, a bus sighing at a curb. Renna shoved past a man with a dog and sprinted across a patch of grass toward a construction fence, scrambling up like a feral cat. Yelena took the fence, too, and swung cleanly over, landing five feet from Renna’s stumble.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t make me embarrass you,” Yelena panted, almost cheerful.</span></p><p><span>Renna threw a handful of gravel and ran.</span></p><p><span>Alice’s voice was cool steel in their ears. “Traffic is heavy on 6th. If she goes east, you lose the clear line. West is better, fewer cars, more pedestrians.”</span></p><p><span>“Copy,” Rio said, her breath steady despite the burning in her legs. She gained on Renna at the crosswalk, boots pounding the white paint. Renna barreled through, eyes wild, and a horn blared so close the air bowed.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t—!” Rio shouted, reaching—</span></p><p><span>Renna darted between two cars and out into the next lane, head turned back over her shoulder, triumph like a fever on her face. She didn’t see the city bus until it was wholly there, an impossible rectangle filling her world. There was a single, collective sound, an inhale that belonged to a thousand throats, and then the impact slammed sound into silence.</span></p><p><span>Everything stopped.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s body made the decision her mind didn’t have time to form. She cut left, shoulder-checking a stunned pedestrian out of her path, and slid on her knees beside Renna’s crumpled body. Blood slicked the asphalt in an ordinary, obscene smear. She put pressure on what she could reach and spoke in the voice she used to talk people back from edge.</span></p><p><span>“Stay with me. Stay with me.”</span></p><p><span>Renna’s eyes flicked, the triumph gone, something bitter and childish clawing at what was left. Her lips moved; nothing came out. She tried again.</span></p><p><span>“She… owes… me,” she croaked, and then her eyes rolled back, and her body went lax under Rio’s hands.</span></p><p><span>“Medic!” Rio barked. “Now!”</span></p><p><span>“Two blocks out,” Maria said, voice distant and too calm. “On the way.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky crouched beside her, jaw set, hand outstretched and useless. Yelena stood very still, the wind lifting a piece of hair across her cheek like a private gesture of mourning she would never admit.</span></p><p><span>The siren rose before the medic’s shape, the cry of something designed to move through the world as if it owned it. It pulled up half on the curb, doors flinging open, and then there were gloved hands and the language of triage. Rio gave them everything: what had happened, how many seconds had passed. She fell back when they took over. Blood streaked her palms and the knees of her pants, and for a moment she saw another street, another body, another desperate press of hands.</span></p><p><span>“Vidal.” Bucky’s voice brought her back like a slap. “Look at me.”</span></p><p><span>She did. His eyes were the same as they’d been in a dozen countries, right before the ground learned to move and took men with it. “This isn’t on you,” he said quietly. “You did it right.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded once, the motion blunt and insufficient.</span></p><p><span>“Status?” Alice asked, voice carefully neutral.</span></p><p><span>“Renna is down,” Rio said. “EMS is actively working. Send an Agent to follow up at the hospital and notify PD. Secure the plaza. Keep Agatha moving.”</span></p><p><span>“Copy,” Maria answered crisply. “Raven is in custody, on the way to secure holding. Agatha is safe inside the corridor with Wanda and two agents. Press is… feral. Jen is doing her job.”</span></p><p><span>“Tell her to prep a statement,” Rio said, standing. “Accident during a police-assisted pursuit. Sympathy for the family. No further comment pending investigation.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky flanked her as they cleared the scene for the medics to load. The bus driver sat on the curb, white as winter, hands shaking between his knees. Rio paused, just long enough to touch his shoulder.</span></p><p><span>“I’m sorry,” she said quietly. “It happened fast. This wasn’t your fault.”</span></p><p><span>He nodded without looking, his eyes somewhere far away.</span></p><p><span>By the time they reached the plaza again, the energy had bent into something taut and brittle. News of a chase and a crash had reached the crowd before they did; information moved faster than feet. Agatha stood behind the stage screen with Wanda, the two of them bracketed by Sonya and Steve. She looked up when Rio approached, face searching hers like a hand in the dark.</span></p><p><span>Rio gave her the truth, not all of it, not here. “Raven is in custody,” she said softly. “Renna ran. There was an accident. She didn’t make it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hand came up, then fell, then came up again and found Rio’s sleeve. “Is that relief?” she asked in a voice that wasn’t hers. “Or am I going to hell because I don’t know what to feel?”</span></p><p><span>“It’s shock,” Rio said, and the kindness in her voice was a mercy. “And it’s okay.” She glanced past Agatha’s shoulder to Wanda, who nodded once, fierce and gentle.</span></p><p><span>Jen appeared, tablet already glowing with headline permutations. “I’ve got three drafts,” she said, eyes flicking between Rio and Agatha. “Short sympathy. Longer sympathy with safety emphasis. Or we say nothing and let SHIELD take the first hit.”</span></p><p><span>“SHIELD first,” Rio decided. “Neutral, procedural. Then Agatha echoes with thanks and a reminder not to engage, not to romanticize this. Lilia can speak to the cost, if she wants. We do not gloat. We do not taunt. We keep it human.”</span></p><p><span>“Copy,” Jen said, already typing.</span></p><p><span>Alice’s voice came in like a weather report. “Crowd still calm, if restless. Fans are talking about how they spotted Renna, there’s pride in it. We should harness that. It’s good for the narrative and for the tip lines.”</span></p><p><span>“Give them the right phrases,” Maria said. “They want to help; we tell them how to do it safely.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha stepped into the tent’s edge, as quiet as a blade. “Raven didn’t fight,” she reported. “But she smiled. We’ll see if she keeps doing that when the room gets small.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed. “Do I… go back out?” Her eyes flicked toward the stage, where a hundred paper signs still bobbed in hopeful hands.</span></p><p><span>Rio hesitated, then shook her head. “No. Not now.” She softened it with a touch to Agatha’s fingers. “You were seen. That mattered. Now we control the exit.”</span></p><p><span>They moved the pieces fast. The perimeter tightened; the crowd was thanked and dismissed in a voice Jen scripted and a volunteer read into a mic. The fans went like tide, reluctant but obedient, chattering like starlings. A handful lingered at the barricades and pressed small gifts into the hands of agents with soft smiles: letters, bracelets, a purple paper crane.</span></p><p><span>“Those are for her,” a teenager whispered to Sonya, eyes big. “Tell her we’re not scared.”</span></p><p><span>Sonya surprised herself by softening. “I will.”</span></p><p><span>The convoy rolled a different route, the city turning its usual indifference back on itself. In the second SUV, Agatha watched the feeds Jen had pulled to her phone, thumb hovering over a flood of messages that were neither hate nor worship but something stranger: gratitude, pride, grief for a stranger who had tried to ruin her life and died in the process.</span></p><p><span>At a red light, she caught her reflection in the glass, tired, composed, older than yesterday, and then Rio’s beside her, steady as a lighthouse. Agatha reached across the inches and intertwined their fingers, needing the answer their bodies had been giving each other for weeks.</span></p><p><span>In the lead car, Maria took a call on speaker. “EMS just confirmed,” she said, voice even. “Time of death at the scene.”</span></p><p><span>Silence answered, respectful and practical and tired.</span></p><p><span>“Bucky and I will handle PD,” Rio said. “Natasha, you and Yelena sit with Raven until I get there. No heroics. No theatrics.”</span></p><p><span>“Only professionalism,” Natasha said dryly. “And perhaps a smile.”</span></p><p><span>“Please don’t smile,” Maria muttered, but they could all hear the corner of her mouth lift.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The house was quieter than it had been in weeks, but the silence was deceptive. Outside the gates, paparazzi still prowled. Social media still churned with theories, hashtags, and blurry photos. And inside, every person in Agatha’s circle carried the invisible hum of exhaustion, the weight of the staged meet-and-greet, Raven’s capture, and Renna’s sudden death in the street.</span></p><p><span>Steve and Sonya patrolled the perimeter, shadows slipping across the windows whenever they circled the porch. Natasha and Yelena had claimed the dining room table, pretending to play cards, though both were listening on comms, eyes sharp. Bucky sat in the den with his rifle across his lap, disassembling and cleaning it with the precision of someone keeping his hands busy to keep his mind still. Alice, hunched in the surveillance van, muttered curses at code and firewalls. Clint is talking to his wife and kids in his room.</span></p><p><span>And then there was the kitchen, where Agatha lingered at the threshold, arms folded, unsure if she belonged in this moment of domesticity after so much blood and chaos. She still didn’t know what to feel about Renna—relief, sorrow, guilt. The woman had once adored her, and now she was gone. Agatha had built her career controlling a narrative, and this was one she couldn’t rewrite.</span></p><p><span>Rio emerged from the pantry with her sleeves rolled up and a paper bag in hand, flannel loose at the collar. There was something almost mischievous about her expression, something that looked out of place but desperately needed.</span></p><p><span>“How would you like to help me make Korean corn dogs for dinner tonight, cariño?” Rio asked casually, as though she hadn’t just spent the day hunting down enemies and running interference for Agatha’s life.</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked at her. “Now? Really? Is this the time?” Her voice wavered, betraying the uncertainty in her chest.</span></p><p><span>Rio set the bag down on the counter and crossed the kitchen, cupping Agatha’s face in her hands. Her calloused thumbs brushed gently along her cheekbones, steadying her. “We’ve taken three pieces off the board, mi vida—Kyra, Raven, and Renna. Soon we’ll find the rest. This is a time for celebration, even if it’s just us. Besides—” her mouth twitched into the smallest smile— “I promised you I’d make these one day. Had one of the agents run out for the ingredients.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s lips quirked, unwillingly tugged toward warmth. “You’re ridiculous.”</span></p><p><span>“And you’re stalling,” Rio countered smoothly.</span></p><p><span>With a theatrical sigh, Agatha threw up her hands. “Fine. But if I burn this place down, you can’t blame me.”</span></p><p><span>“Good thing I’m fireproof,” Rio teased, pressing a quick kiss to her forehead before moving to the counter.</span></p><p><span>The kitchen soon filled with the clatter of bowls, the sharp hiss of oil heating, and a chorus of voices drifting in. Natasha and Yelena peeked in from the dining room, Yelena smirking. “If this is domestic bliss, I want no part of it. But also—save me two.”</span></p><p><span>“Two?” Natasha asked dryly. “She’ll want five.”</span></p><p><span>“Ten,” Yelena corrected solemnly, arms crossed.</span></p><p><span>Agatha swatted at them with a dish towel, earning a laugh from the sisters. “You vultures. Let us at least cook them before you steal them all.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky leaned in the doorway, arms folded, smirk tugging at his mouth. “Domestic life suits you two. Never thought I’d see Harkness in an apron.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked down at the borrowed apron Rio had tied around her waist, then flipped the towel at him. “Careful, Barnes. I may like you, but I’ve got a bodyguard who terrifies me in all the right ways.”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t even look up from skewering mozzarella sticks, but Agatha caught the faint smile tugging at her lips. The room warmed in a way it hadn’t in weeks.</span></p><p><span>And then the reinforcements arrived.</span></p><p><span>Lilia swept in first, coat draped around her shoulders like armor. Wanda followed, slipping her shoes off at the door. Jen and Billy trailed behind, bickering about whether pineapple belonged on pizza. The moment they spotted Agatha dusted in flour with Rio at her side, all conversation stopped.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, this is precious,” Lilia drawled, her eyes glinting. “Agatha Harkness cooking? Someone get a camera.”</span></p><p><span>“Already got it,” Billy said, phone halfway out of his pocket, before Agatha shot him a glare that could curdle milk.</span></p><p><span>“Put it away, boy,” she ordered, trying not to laugh.</span></p><p><span>Wanda perched against the counter, arms crossed, smirk firmly in place. “I thought you said you couldn’t even boil water without supervision.”</span></p><p><span>“I can’t,” Agatha admitted, brandishing the wooden spoon like a sword. “That’s why I’m letting Rio do all the dangerous work. I’m just here to look pretty.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re succeeding,” Rio muttered, so low it was meant only for Agatha.</span></p><p><span>But Wanda’s ears caught it. “Oh, my god. Did she just flirt in public? Mark the calendar.”</span></p><p><span>Jen clapped her hands together. “Finally! Our resident ice queen melts. Rio, what’s your secret? Is it the flannel? It’s the flannel, isn’t it?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha groaned, tossing the towel onto the counter. “This is harassment.”</span></p><p><span>“This is justice,” Wanda corrected.</span></p><p><span>“Justice with a side of fried cheese,” Lilia added dryly, settling into a chair.</span></p><p><span>The first batch came out golden and crisp, set carefully on a rack by Rio. Yelena darted in, grabbing one before anyone else could. She yelped dramatically when it burned her tongue, but didn’t stop chewing.</span></p><p><span>“Good,” she declared. “Too good. I call dibs.”</span></p><p><span>“On what? The whole tray?” Natasha asked, swiping one for herself.</span></p><p><span>Bucky snagged another, nodding his approval. “Better than rations. Don’t quit your day job, but… not bad, Vidal.”</span></p><p><span>“High praise,” Rio deadpanned.</span></p><p><span>Alice eventually wandered in, with dark circles under her eyes, but drawn by the smell. She grabbed two, muttering something about deserving sustenance after drowning in code all day. Steve and Sonya came in from their patrol, rifles still slung, faces softening at the sight of food.</span></p><p><span>And then the kitchen transformed into something Agatha hadn’t seen in too long: laughter, clinking plates, voices overlapping in warmth instead of strategy or fear. Wanda stole half of Agatha’s corn dog, only to get smacked with the towel. Billy teased Rio about burning oil, earning himself a firm swat from Lilia. Even Jen cracked a smile between bites, though she kept one eye on her phone, already bracing for the media storm that would follow tomorrow. Clint, Natasha, and Yelena are bickering over something Agatha doesn’t understand.</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned back against the counter, watching the chaos unfold like it was a rare treasure. This team, this patchwork family, they had carried her through fire and fear. And at the center of it all was Rio, sleeves rolled, hair pulled back, laughing in a way Agatha hadn’t heard in weeks. It felt like sunlight breaking through storm clouds.</span></p><p><span>When the plates emptied and the chatter mellowed, the others drifted off, Natasha and Maria on a call, Wanda dragging Billy into a debate about which Disney princess would win in a fight, mother and son strongly defending their picks, Yelena guarding her last corn dog like it was classified intel. The kitchen quieted until it was just Rio and Agatha again.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned against the counter beside her, wiping her hands on a towel. “See? Not so bad.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha tilted her head, smiling despite the heaviness still curled in her chest. “You’re infuriating, you know that? Making me laugh when I should be stewing.”</span></p><p><span>“Stewing doesn’t change anything,” Rio murmured, reaching for her hand. “But laughing reminds you why you fight.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s throat tightened. She let Rio lace their fingers together, her thumb brushing over Rio’s knuckles. “I’ll admit it. This was exactly what I needed.”</span></p><p><span>Rio bent down, close enough for her breath to ghost against Agatha’s lips. “Good. Because tonight? Tonight we choose joy.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let her kiss her then—slow, tender, tasting breadcrumbs and warmth and something like hope. For the first time in weeks, she believed it.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hand lingered against Rio’s cheek, her thumb stroking across skin that had spent years set in stone but now softened beneath her touch. The rest of the world fell away, the hum of the fridge, the muffled laughter of the team down the hall, even the shadow of Renna’s death still clawing at her mind. All she could focus on was Rio: her warmth, her scent, the safety and danger all bound up in one.</span></p><p><span>Rio kissed her again, slower this time, lips coaxing instead of commanding. Agatha leaned in, sighing against her mouth, her chest pressing into Rio’s as though she could pour herself into her bodyguard and never have to stand on her own again.</span></p><p><span>When Rio pulled back, just barely, their noses brushing, Agatha whispered, “You terrify me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stilled. Her brow furrowed, misreading the words. “Terrify you?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smiled faintly, a tear threatening but not falling. “Because I’ve never wanted someone this much. Because if you ever walked away, I think I’d unravel.” She laughed once, sharp and self-deprecating. “And because I never thought I’d be reckless enough to fall in love again.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s breath caught. For a moment, she said nothing, just searched Agatha’s eyes like she was scanning for a trap. But all she saw was raw, trembling truth.</span></p><p><span>“You’re in love with me,” Rio said, voice low and rough, as though speaking it aloud was dangerous.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tilted her head, a smirk tugging at her lips despite the vulnerability. “Was I not obvious? I thought the shameless flirting, the clinging, the jealous glares at anyone who so much as looks at you might’ve given it away.”</span></p><p><span>Rio huffed a laugh, shaking her head. “Agatha—”</span></p><p><span>“No.” Agatha pressed a finger to her lips. “I’m not joking this time. I love you, Rio. Completely. Irrationally. Hopelessly.” Her voice broke on the last word. “And if that scares you, well, it scares me too. But I can’t hold it in anymore.”</span></p><p><span>For a long moment, Rio didn’t move. Her chest rose and fell, eyes glinting like storm clouds caught in sunlight. Then she caught Agatha’s hand, pressed it flat against her heart, and whispered, “You think you’re the only one who’s terrified? I’ve spent my whole life building walls, keeping people safe, but never letting them close after Val. You kicked those walls down without even trying. And it scared the hell out of me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s throat tightened. “Rio…”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s lips trembled, but she pressed on. “I love you. I’ve loved you longer than I let myself admit. From the moment you looked at me in that conference room, like you already knew me. I tried to fight it, because God knows, loving you makes me reckless. But it’s the truth. I love you, Agatha Harkness.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t answer with words at first. She surged forward, capturing Rio’s mouth with hers, pouring every ounce of relief, joy, and fire into the kiss. Rio groaned softly, hands sliding to Agatha’s waist, gripping her like she might vanish.</span></p><p><span>When they finally broke apart, panting, Agatha whispered against her lips, “Say it again.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s forehead rested against hers. “I love you.”</span></p><p><span>Again, Agatha demanded silently with her eyes.</span></p><p><span>“I love you,” Rio repeated, firmer, surer. “And I’m not going anywhere.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smiled so wide it almost hurt. “Good. Because I plan to keep you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio chuckled, then silenced her with another kiss. This one turned hot fast, urgency overtaking tenderness. Agatha’s hands tangled in Rio’s hair, pulling her closer, while Rio’s fingers dug into the curve of her hips. The spoon on the counter clattered to the floor when Agatha’s elbow knocked it aside. Neither of them cared.</span></p><p><span>They stumbled backward, mouths never parting, until Agatha’s back hit the fridge with a soft thud. She gasped, laughing breathlessly, but Rio swallowed the sound with her tongue, devouring her like she’d been starving for years.</span></p><p><span>Somewhere down the hall, Wanda shouted at Billy about stealing the last corn dog. The laughter and noise of the house felt far away, muffled beneath the pounding of their own hearts. For once, Agatha didn’t care who heard or saw, this was theirs.</span></p><p><span>Rio grabbed Agatha’s hand and tugged, half-leading, half-dragging her toward the hallway. They kissed sloppily as they went, bumping into the edge of the counter, stumbling over a chair leg. Agatha giggled into Rio’s mouth, biting her bottom lip playfully.</span></p><p><span>“You’re going to kill us both before we make it to the room,” Agatha teased, breathless.</span></p><p><span>“Worth it,” Rio growled, slamming her back against the wall to kiss her deeper.</span></p><p><span>They tripped down the hall, hitting picture frames and doorframes, never breaking apart. Agatha’s coat slipped from her shoulders, forgotten on the floor. Rio’s flannel came half undone, tugged impatiently by Agatha’s roaming hands.</span></p><p><span>By the time they reached Rio’s bedroom door, they were laughing and gasping between kisses, their bodies already pressed flush. Rio kicked the door open with a grunt, shoved Agatha inside, and closed it with a thud as their mouths met again.</span></p><p><span>The world outside could wait. For tonight, there was only this: love confessed, fear undone, and the heat of two women who’d finally stopped running from what was inevitable.</span></p><p><span>And for the first time in their lives, neither of them wanted to run again.</span></p><p> </p>

<p><span>The morning light was pale and forgiving, the kind of gold that seemed to stretch time thin. Agatha stirred first, blinking at the faint smell of coffee drifting through the room. The space was quiet save for the gentle hum of the heater and the muffled shuffle of someone moving in the kitchen.</span></p><p><span>She turned her head to find Rio still beside her, propped up against the headboard with a mug in hand, hair mussed and damp from an early shower. She wore a gray T-shirt and loose sweatpants, utterly unguarded, utterly domestic. Agatha blinked, smiling softly.</span></p><p><span>“You made coffee,” she said, her voice still husky from sleep.</span></p><p><span>Rio handed her the second mug on the nightstand. “Of course. I wasn’t about to risk your wrath by letting you wake up uncaffeinated.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha took the mug, curling into Rio’s side as naturally as breathing. The warmth of the coffee seeped through her fingers, but the warmth of Rio’s arm around her shoulder was what settled her chest. For a long moment, they sat in silence, just sipping and letting the quiet stretch.</span></p><p><span>“Last night wasn’t a dream, right?” Agatha asked at last, tilting her face toward Rio.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s thumb brushed the back of her hand. “No dream. I meant every word, mi vida.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled softly, leaning her head against Rio’s shoulder. “Good. Because if it was, it was the kind I’d fight to stay in.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled, pressing a kiss to the crown of her hair. “You’re ridiculous.”</span></p><p><span>“You love it.”</span></p><p><span>“I love you,” Rio corrected gently, the words easier now, steady.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stilled, then smiled in a way that felt brand new, brighter than any stage light she’d ever stood under. “Say that again.”</span></p><p><span>Rio turned her head and did, brushing her lips against Agatha’s temple. “I love you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed her eyes, whispering back, “I love you too.”</span></p><p><span>They didn’t need to fill the silence after that. It was enough to curl together in bed, coffee cooling on the nightstand, the world held at bay just a little longer. Agatha let herself believe that, for this moment at least, there were no stalkers, no threats, no cameras waiting outside. Just two women, warm and tired and stupidly in love, sharing a morning that felt almost ordinary.</span></p><p><span>“Do we have to get up today?” Agatha murmured.</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked, pulling her tighter against her chest. “Eventually. But not yet.”</span></p><p><span>So they didn’t.</span></p><p><span>Morning at the Harkness house felt…different. Lighter, somehow. The winter sun pooled across the kitchen tile, and the long farmhouse table was loaded with mismatched mugs, a mountain of toast, a skillet of scrambled eggs, and a suspicious number of empty hot sauce bottles that had “Yelena” written all over them.</span></p><p><span>Natasha sat at the head of the table, unbothered serenity incarnate, flipping through her phone. Yelena was elbow-deep in a jar of pickles like it was an emotional support animal. Clint was methodically buttering toast with sniper-level focus. Alice typed one-handed on her laptop while sipping coffee strong enough to dissolve a spoon. Bucky had the morning paper open but hadn’t turned a page in five minutes. On the other end, Lilia, Wanda, Jen, and Billy clustered like a committee, whispering in the very unsubtle way of people who very much wanted to be overheard.</span></p><p><span>Then Rio and Agatha walked in.</span></p><p><span>Rio: soft gray tee, joggers, wet hair. Agatha: oversized navy cardigan over a silk camisole, bare feet, a glow that could power Los Angeles. They were close enough to share a heartbeat, hands brushing, eyes doing that private, secret language thing that made everyone else at the table exchange the same badly concealed smirk.</span></p><p><span>“Morning,” Agatha sang, sliding into the chair beside Rio and promptly nabbing half the strawberries from her plate.</span></p><p><span>“Morning,” the table answered, too sweetly, in perfect chorus.</span></p><p><span>Rio poured coffee, pretending not to notice twelve eyes on them. “What’d we miss?”</span></p><p><span>“Sleep,” Yelena said, far too loudly. “Many of us missed sleep.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha didn’t look up. “Truly shocking for a security team used to night ops.”</span></p><p><span>“Night ops do not usually involve—” Yelena circled a hand in the air, grasping for a diplomatic term. “—theatrical sound design.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky coughed into his mug. Clint bit the inside of his cheek, losing the fight with a grin. Alice covered her mouth and typed, “theatrical sound design” into her notes, because of course she did.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s lips parted in delighted scandal. “Did we… keep people up?” She sounded thrilled.</span></p><p><span>Jen dropped her forehead to the table. “Up? Honey, I learned new vocabulary.”</span></p><p><span>Billy fanned himself with a dish towel. “At one point I considered calling the fire department.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda raised a hand like a witness in court. “I put a pillow over my head and still learned… a lot about acoustics.”</span></p><p><span>Rio choked on her coffee, color blooming high on her cheekbones. “Okay, that’s, everyone can stop now.”</span></p><p><span>“Impossible,” Yelena said. “We are just getting started.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia lifted her mug with maternal gravitas. “As your manager and the matriarch of this group, I have a moral obligation to say: good for you. Also, perhaps next time, soundproofing.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha slid her hand to the back of Rio’s neck and scratched lightly at the hairline, the way she now knew made Rio melt. “Don’t listen to them, cariño. We were very tastefully loud.”</span></p><p><span>“Those words don’t go together,” Alice murmured, eyes still on her screen, though the corner of her mouth was betraying her.</span></p><p><span>Clint leaned in from across the table. “Look, I’m not saying it was a symphony, but there were… movements.”</span></p><p><span>“Allegro,” Bucky offered.</span></p><p><span>“Molto,” Wanda added, straight-faced.</span></p><p><span>Agatha pressed her knuckles to her mouth and giggled like a teenager. Rio gave up and laughed too, that low, warm sound that made several people at the table exchange a “there it is” glance.</span></p><p><span>“Okay, okay,” Rio said, palms up, surrendering. “We will… consider the soundproofing. And issue a formal apology to the household.”</span></p><p><span>Jen peeked up. “Accepted. In writing, please. With a fruit basket.”</span></p><p><span>“Done,” Agatha said instantly, then leaned into Rio’s shoulder and kissed her cheek. “Though for the record, I regret nothing.”</span></p><p><span>“You never do,” Wanda said dryly, fondness softening every word.</span></p><p><span>The teasing ebbed just enough for breakfast to resume. Plates circled. Toast vanished. Someone passed Yelena another hot sauce, and Alice finally put the laptop down long enough to inhale eggs.</span></p><p><span>In the soft lull, Lilia watched the two women with the kind of gaze that knew history and hurt and had been waiting for this. “You look happy,” she said, not as a question.</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned, face open, almost shy beneath the mischief. “I am.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hand found Agatha’s beneath the table. Fingers laced. “Me too,” she said simply.</span></p><p><span>The room shifted, just a fraction, like the whole house breathed out. Whatever they’d all suspected, joked about, tiptoed around, was now warm and undeniable in the morning light.</span></p><p><span>Agatha reached for the jam, missed, and ended up smearing a stripe of raspberry on Rio’s wrist. She caught Rio’s hand without thinking and licked it off, slow and a little wicked.</span></p><p><span>The table went silent for a beat. Then Yelena dropped her fork. “Prison. I should be in prison. You cannot do that before 9 a.m.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky folded his paper at last, deadpan as granite. “We will pass out blindfolds at breakfast from now on.”</span></p><p><span>Rio set her forehead briefly against Agatha’s temple, groaning into her hair. “They’re never going to let us live, are they?”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Agatha said cheerfully. “And I love it.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s smile gentled. “It’s good to see you both like this. We needed a win.”</span></p><p><span>“We did,” Rio agreed. The steel in her eyes didn’t vanish, couldn’t, not with everything still ahead, but it softened around the edges. “And there will be more.”</span></p><p><span>Alice cleared her throat, business sneaking back in. “There will also be debrief at ten. Media fallout. Forensics from Raven’s devices. Leads from the tip line.”</span></p><p><span>Jen nodded, lifting her coffee. “And I’ve got talking points for the morning shows. We’ll control the narrative.”</span></p><p><span>“Mm,” Agatha hummed, already sliding her chair closer to Rio’s. “As long as none of those talking points include my nocturnal… cardio.”</span></p><p><span>“God, please,” Billy muttered. “I’m a child.”</span></p><p><span>“You are twenty-two,” Lilia said, patting his hand. “And last night you learned more than any internship could teach you.”</span></p><p><span>“Lilia,” Wanda warned, choking on her coffee.</span></p><p><span>“What? I’m supportive.”</span></p><p><span>They dissolved into laughter again, softer, easier this time. It rolled around the table and settled into the walls, another thread woven into the strange tapestry they’d made together: soldiers and spies, a publicist with a dragon’s bite, a manager with a lion’s heart, a genius with sleep-deprived eyes, a few misfits who’d become a family, and at the center, an actress and her bodyguard who were no longer pretending not to be in love.</span></p><p><span>Agatha finished her coffee and stood, tugging lightly at the hem of Rio’s shirt. “Walk me to wardrobe?”</span></p><p><span>“In your own house?” Clint asked.</span></p><p><span>“It’s about the journey,” Agatha said loftily.</span></p><p><span>Rio stood, fighting a smile, and let herself be led. At the doorway, she glanced back. “Ten a.m., war room.”</span></p><p><span>“Copy,” Natasha said.</span></p><p><span>“And, uh,” Rio added, cheeks pinking again, “thanks for… the notes on our volume control.”</span></p><p><span>“Buy a rug,” Yelena called. “Thick one. I’ll invoice you for the therapy.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blew a kiss over her shoulder. “No refunds.”</span></p><p><span>They disappeared down the hall, hands brushing, laughter echoing after them. Around the table, the team traded looks, fond, exasperated, relieved. Outside, Steve and Sonya paced the line, watchful as ever. Inside, for one fragile morning, everything felt almost normal. </span></p><p><span>Later that day, Rio and Agatha were curled up on the couch, locked in a mock-serious debate over which captain reigned supreme on </span><em><span>Below Deck</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>“Captain Sandy has the best leadership skills, end of story,” Rio argued, crossing her arms with military precision.</span></p><p><span>Agatha scoffed dramatically. “Please, darling. It’s Captain Lee. The man is iconic. Have you seen his one-liners? He could sink a yacht and still make it sound charming.”</span></p><p><span>Billy, perched on the armrest, jumped in eagerly. “Captain Glenn is underrated. Chillest guy in the franchise. I’d actually sail with him.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda, sipping from her wineglass, gave an approving nod. “I agree. Glenn doesn’t yell, and people still respect him. That’s power.”</span></p><p><span>The laughter that followed was easy, warm, four voices tangling together like a family dinner table argument. </span></p><p><span>Then the air shifted. Jen swept into the room like a stormfront, tension clinging to her every step. Without a word, she dropped her laptop onto the table with a heavy </span><em><span>thunk</span></em><span>. The sound cut through the laughter, silencing it instantly. All eyes swung toward her, and then to the screen, as if the glowing device itself might explain the sudden weight pressing into the room.</span></p><p><span>Jen clicked a key, and the screen filled with news articles, headlines bold and sensational.</span></p><p><b>“Agatha Harkness’ Stalkers Finally Named – Two Captured, One Dead After Chase”</b><b><br/></b> <b>“The Seventh Veil Unmasked: Online Fandom Shaken”</b><b><br/></b> <b>“From Fan Pages to Felonies: The Dark Descent of Agatha’s Obsessives”</b></p><p><span>Jen’s voice was steady, though her eyes betrayed fatigue. “The media storm hasn’t slowed since last night. Every major outlet is running with the story: Raven in custody, Renna dead. Agatha, your name is trending globally again. Fans are torn, some are grieving what they thought were ‘beloved fan figures,’ others are furious on your behalf, and the majority? They’re demanding justice.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s jaw tightened, but she said nothing. Rio slid a hand across her knee under the table, grounding her.</span></p><p><span>Jen cleared her throat. “And then there’s this.”</span></p><p><span>A new set of posts appeared, the usernames generic, burner accounts. But the tone is unmistakable.</span></p><p><b>@CicadaSong89:</b> <em><span>You took my sister. You took Renna. And you dare celebrate? This isn’t over. Agatha, you’ll bleed for her death.</span></em></p><p><b>@SereneSpeaks:</b> <em><span>Kyra rots in your cage. Renna’s blood is on your hands. I won’t forgive. I won’t forget. You think cutting us down one by one makes you safe? You’re wrong. Every move you make, I’ll be watching. Every laugh, every kiss, every secret—I’ll burn it all down.</span></em></p><p><span>Alice leaned forward, scrolling on her own tablet. “Both posts match digital signatures tied to Seren Auden. No attempt to hide it. She wants us to know she’s pissed.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s putting it lightly,” Clint muttered.</span></p><p><span>“Good,” Natasha said coolly, arms crossed. “Anger makes people sloppy. She’s waving her hand like a flare. She’ll come to us.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky shook his head. “Or she’ll come at us. Seren’s not just mad. She’s unhinged. Kyra’s her twin, they built this thing together. You lock up one, kill the other, and she’s gonna make it personal.”</span></p><p><span>The room went heavy.</span></p><p><span>Agatha finally broke her silence. Her voice was low, trembling with something between fury and grief. “I didn’t want Renna dead. I just wanted this to stop. All of it. And now they’re using her like some martyr.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia stopped pacing, turned sharply. “Don’t you dare take that guilt, Agatha. Renna made her choice. She chose to hunt you, to smear you, to join this cult of obsession. Actions have consequences.” Her voice cracked, raw. “And Seren will pay hers.”</span></p><p><span>Rio squeezed Agatha’s hand, firm. “Listen to her. This isn’t on you. They put themselves in this fight when they came after you. And we’ll end it.”</span></p><p><span>Jen spoke again, softer now. “The fans know that, Agatha. They’re loud, angry, protective. They’re calling Seren’s posts what they are, threats. Hashtags like </span><em><span>#ProtectAgatha</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>#ShutDownTheSeven</span></em><span> are everywhere. But… so is </span><em><span>#RennaDeservedBetter.</span></em><span> It’s split. Which means Seren has an audience now.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s head snapped up at that. “Then we make sure Seren doesn’t get to use it. Amplify the truth. No one deserves to have their privacy violated, no one deserves to be hunted. That’s what we put out.”</span></p><p><span>Alice nodded. “And meanwhile, I keep tracking Seren’s movements. These posts weren’t just angry, they were careless. She left trails. I’ll find her.”</span></p><p><span>The silence that followed was sharp, everyone knowing the fight wasn’t close to over. Agatha exhaled slowly, lifting her chin, though her voice cracked on the words: “Then let’s finish this. All of it. Before anyone else dies.”</span></p><p><span>Rio pulled her closer, her steady gaze making the promise Agatha couldn’t say aloud. “We will.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha squeezed Rio’s hand once, quick and intimate, then excused herself toward the back door. “I need some air,” she said lightly, “and a moment alone.” Her smile was small but genuine; she gave Rio a look that said more than the words. Rio watched her go, then gave a single nod that was both permission and protection.</span></p><p><span>Bucky and Natasha were already up, moving like shadows that belonged to the room. They fell into positions along the back path, close enough to step in, far enough to preserve the privacy Agatha asked for. The house felt suddenly wide and thin without her presence, the soundtrack of normalcy missing a beat.</span></p><p><span>Rio was about to head to the study to sketch out bait lines and timelines, anything to keep the Seven off balance, when Wanda stepped up beside her. She approached without ceremony, that quiet inevitability people used to describe disasters and miracles. For a second, they simply regarded each other: two keepers of a woman they loved, both dangerous in their own ways.</span></p><p><span>“You and I haven’t talked,” Wanda said finally, voice low, steady. “Not really. And we should.”</span></p><p><span>Rio crossed her arms, schooling her face into neutrality. “Alright. What about?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda tilted her head, like she was measuring Rio’s heart rate through sheer will. “About Agatha. About what you mean to her. And what she means to you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw tightened. “She means everything,” she said simply, but there was a weight in her tone that left no room for doubt.</span></p><p><span>Wanda stepped closer, softening slightly. “Then let’s be clear with each other. I’ve known Agatha longer than almost anyone. I’ve seen her fall in love, once. Her first love broke her in a way I didn’t think she’d recover from. It took years to piece her back together, years of work and trust. I don’t want to see her shattered like that again.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s throat went dry. She swallowed. “I would never do that to her.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda arched a brow. “Not willingly, maybe. But you’re a soldier. And soldiers throw themselves into the fire. Don’t think I haven’t seen the way you stand between her and danger like you’re begging the universe to take you instead. You might not realize it, but to Agatha, losing you would break her just the same.”</span></p><p><span>The words landed heavier than Rio expected. She unclenched her fists, then rubbed the back of her neck as if to ground herself. “I’ve already lost one family like that. My Delta team. Valkyrie.” Her voice faltered, and she took a breath. “We were everything to each other. Then they were gone, and I survived. I still wake up feeling like I shouldn’t have. That guilt never leaves.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda listened quietly, her expression softening further. “And now you’ve found Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded. “She pulled me out of that spiral without even knowing it. At first, I fought it, hell, I fought it hard. I thought caring for her like this made me weak. But it doesn’t. It makes me want to fight harder. Still… I can’t lose her. I can’t survive another loss like that.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s hand came to rest lightly on Rio’s forearm, surprising them both. “Then don’t make it a choice between you or her. Protect her, yes. Love her, fiercely. But don’t martyr yourself. She doesn’t need another ghost to haunt her. She needs someone who stays.”</span></p><p><span>For a long moment, neither spoke. The weight of shared grief and shared love settled between them, and in that silence, an understanding formed.</span></p><p><span>“I love her,” Rio said finally, her voice rough but steady. “More than I’ve ever loved anyone. And I’ll do whatever it takes to protect her. Not just from the Seven, but from the fear that keeps her from believing she deserves to be loved.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda nodded slowly, her lips curving into something between a smile and a sigh. “Good. Because that’s the only way you’ll survive her. And she you.” She squeezed Rio’s arm before stepping back. “We’re on the same side, you and I. Different kinds of love, but the same fire.”</span></p><p><span>Rio let out a faint laugh, almost disbelieving. “Guess Agatha inspires that in people.”</span></p><p><span>“She does,” Wanda agreed softly. “She always has.”</span></p><p><span>The back door creaked open then, and Agatha stepped back inside, cheeks flushed from the night air. She caught sight of the two of them standing together, her brows quirking with suspicion.</span></p><p><span>“Well,” Agatha drawled, smirking faintly. “If this is the part where I find out you two have been in love this whole time and are plotting to murder me to get rid of the competition, because I can promise I will put up a good fight.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda only smiled and shook her head. Rio looked at Agatha, warmth blooming in her chest despite the heaviness of their talk.</span></p><p><span>“Nothing like that,” Rio said. “Just… understanding each other.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha narrowed her eyes, but she was smiling. “Mm. Dangerous. I should be worried.”</span></p><p><span>But when she stepped closer and took Rio’s hand, she looked more at peace than worried. And for Wanda and Rio both, that was enough. Agatha and Wanda walked to the kitchen, sharing secret laughs and whispers.</span></p><p><span>Rio lingered in the hallway long after Wanda and Agatha had left. She still felt the weight of that conversation in her chest, the unexpected honesty, the promise she’d made. She rubbed a hand down her face, thinking she should start working on a plan for Seren, anything to keep her mind sharp.</span></p><p><span>The study was dim when she pushed the door open. She expected quiet and papers, maybe a moment to collect her thoughts. Instead, she found Lilia seated in one of the leather chairs by the fireplace, a glass of red wine balanced elegantly in her hand.</span></p><p><span>On her lap rested a photo frame. Even in the low light, Rio recognized it: Colten. His sharp grin. His uniform.</span></p><p><span>Lilia didn’t look up at first. She traced the edge of the frame with her thumb, almost absently, like she’d done it a thousand times. Only when Rio cleared her throat did she speak.</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t expect company,” Lilia said softly, her Sicilian accent more pronounced with the weariness in her voice. “But maybe…maybe that’s not such a bad thing.”</span></p><p><span>Rio hesitated in the doorway, then crossed to the opposite chair after shutting the door. She sat slowly, her body stiff from the instinct to keep moving, keep fighting. But here, in this room, the fight felt different.</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t know you kept that picture here,” Rio said.</span></p><p><span>Lilia finally looked at her. Her eyes were wet, though no tears fell. “It’s the last one he sent me. He was smiling. He looked happy. I like to remember him that way.”</span></p><p><span>Rio swallowed. Guilt pressed against her ribs like it always did when Colten’s name came up. “He was happy, Lilia. Even out there. He was…he was a good soldier. Brave. Loyal. The kind of man you wanted beside you when everything went to hell.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia’s lips trembled into something between a smile and a grimace. “He always wanted to make you proud. Said once that you were the kind of leader he could follow through fire.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s chest tightened. She leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees. “I should’ve kept him safe. All of them. That was my job, and—”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Lilia cut her off, sharp enough that it startled Rio. The older woman’s eyes were fierce now, blazing through her grief. “Do not carry that weight alone. Colten knew the risks. He chose them. And he would hate you for sitting here and punishing yourself when you gave him purpose.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw clenched. She dropped her gaze to the floor. “I still regret not being there that day, not dying alongside my team.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia reached across the small table between them, her hand steady despite the wine glass she still held in the other. “You loved them. That is all a leader can do. And Colten…he loved you too. He spoke about you as though you were already family.”</span></p><p><span>The silence stretched, thick but not suffocating. Rio finally let herself breathe, the words tumbling out before she could stop them.</span></p><p><span>“Once, during downtime, Colten tried to teach the squad how to salsa. Said if we could survive gunfire, we could survive dancing.” Rio huffed out a laugh, shaking her head. “He had everyone stepping on each other’s boots, tripping over rifles. I swear, I thought Valkyrie was going to throttle him. But he didn’t care. He had this way of making the worst moments feel…light.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia’s hand flew to her mouth, her eyes crinkling as a laugh burst out, fragile but real. “That sounds like him. He never could sit still. Always had to make a scene.”</span></p><p><span>Rio allowed herself to smile too, the memory softening the edges of her guilt. “He saved me once. During a mission. I was pinned, exposed. He dragged me back behind cover, and when I told him he was reckless, he just grinned and said, ‘You’re reckless all the time, boss. Someone has to return the favor.’”</span></p><p><span>This time, Lilia’s tears did fall, but she was smiling through them. “That’s my boy.”</span></p><p><span>They sat there for a long moment, the wine between them, the photograph catching the glow of the firelight. For once, Rio didn’t try to fight the memories. She let them wash over her, good and bad, and let Lilia carry some of the weight with her.</span></p><p><span>“Thank you,” Lilia whispered finally. “For remembering him. For carrying him with you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded, her voice low. “He deserves to be remembered. And as long as I breathe, he will be.”</span></p><p><span>The two women shared the silence, not as manager and soldier, but as mother and comrade, bound by the same loss.</span></p><p><span>For the first time since Colten’s death, Rio didn’t feel like she was carrying the burden alone. And Lilia, for the first time in months, didn’t feel like she was remembering her son by herself.</span></p><p><span>For the rest of the night, Rio and Lilia shared stories about Colten. Some made them laugh, others left their eyes shining with tears, but through it all, both women felt a little of the weight they’d been carrying slip away. By the time the bottle of wine ran dry, the study felt lighter, almost sacred, like Colten himself had lingered there with them.</span></p><p><span>When they finally rose, Lilia surprised Rio by pulling her into a strong hug. For a second, Rio froze. She hadn’t expected the gesture, but then she returned it just as fiercely. The embrace spoke of shared grief, of trust forged in pain. With a final pat to Rio’s shoulder, Lilia slipped away to her room. Rio lingered only a moment, then headed upstairs. Planning could wait until morning. Tonight, she needed her girlfriend.</span></p><p><span>She slipped quietly into their room and found Agatha curled on her side, eyes closed but not yet asleep. At the sound of Rio undressing, Agatha stirred, blinking up at her with a drowsy smile.</span></p><p><span>“There you are,” Agatha murmured, her voice husky from near-sleep. “I was beginning to think you’d gotten lost, or kidnapped by Wanda.”</span></p><p><span>Rio huffed a soft laugh and slid under the covers, tugging her shirt over her head before gathering Agatha into her arms. “I was with Lilia in the study,” she said, pulling her close until there was no space between them.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tilted her head back just enough to meet Rio’s gaze, eyes soft with understanding. “Good. You both needed that.”</span></p><p><span>Rio pressed a kiss to her temple. “We did.”</span></p><p><span>Half-asleep now, Agatha nestled further against her chest. “Jen wants me to do a livestream tomorrow,” she mumbled. “Alice will screen everyone before they’re allowed in, so Seren, or any of the Seven, can’t slip through.”</span></p><p><span>Rio brushed a hand through her hair, soothing. “We’ll talk more in the morning, mi amor. Rest now.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha sighed contentedly, letting the last of her tension drain away as she drifted toward sleep. Rio held her tighter, listening to the rhythm of her breathing. For the first time in what felt like forever, she allowed herself to close her eyes, knowing they were exactly where they were meant to be.</span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>The next morning, the living room had been transformed into a makeshift studio. Jen fussed over lighting, adjusting stands until the glow was soft but flattering. Alice crouched beside the coffee table, her laptop tethered to Agatha’s, fingers flying as she fine-tuned the firewall and blocking protocols. No member of the Seven was slipping past her.</span></p><p><span>On the couch, Billy was in his element, fussing over Agatha’s makeup with all the concentration of a painter at work. He’d insisted on doing it himself, and judging by the smug little grin on his face as he dabbed at her cheekbones, he was proud of the results.</span></p><p><span>The house was quieter than usual. Wanda had left early for set to reshoot a few scenes, while Lilia had gone into town for groceries. Yelena, of course, had tagged along, not just for protection, but because she’d rattled off an absurd list of snacks that only Lilia was patient enough to fetch.</span></p><p><span>Rio moved in behind Agatha, her presence as steadying as ever. She rested her palms against the actress’s shoulders and began to rub gently, coaxing the tension out of her frame.</span></p><p><span>“Are you nervous, mi amor?” Rio asked softly, leaning down so only Agatha could hear.</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled, a smile tugging at her lips even as she admitted, “A little. Which is strange. I’ve never been nervous to talk to my fans before.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hands paused, then squeezed reassuringly. “It’s alright to be nervous with everything that’s happened. If you don’t want to talk about something, set that boundary when the Live starts and stick to it. No one gets to take your voice from you. And besides—” she dipped low, brushing a quick kiss to Agatha’s temple “—I’ll be right here, just off-camera, like always.”</span></p><p><span>A sharp </span><em><span>pssst!</span></em><span> interrupted them, followed by a cool mist of water across Rio’s face. She blinked in shock. Jen stood there, holding a spray bottle like a weapon.</span></p><p><span>“No kissing!” Jen scolded, wagging the bottle. “You’ll smudge her makeup, and we go live in three minutes. Shoo! You’re a distraction.”</span></p><p><span>Rio glared at her so darkly it could have peeled paint from the walls. Jen, unfazed, waved her off with a flick of her wrist and returned to fiddling with the lighting. Agatha, meanwhile, was doubled over laughing, trying not to smear the makeup Billy had worked so hard on.</span></p><p><span>“Two minutes,” Jen called, glancing at her watch. She leaned down, her voice softening as she gave Agatha one final pep talk. “Just be yourself. Don’t let the Seven change how you are with your coven. They don’t get that power.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded, inhaling slowly, the weight of Jen’s words grounding her. She adjusted her posture, squared her shoulders, and placed her hands over the laptop keyboard.</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped aside to stand in the shadows, out of the camera’s frame but directly in Agatha’s eyeline. She caught her girlfriend’s gaze, gave her a slow nod and the faintest smile. Agatha’s lips curved in answer, strength surging back into her chest.</span></p><p><span>This wasn’t just a livestream. It was a reclamation.</span></p><p><span>Agatha adjusted the collar of her deep violet blouse and leaned toward the camera, a practiced but genuine smile curving her lips. The little red dot blinked to life. For the first time in weeks, she wasn’t standing on a film set or behind a line of bodyguards. She was right here, face-to-face with her fans.</span></p><p><span>“Well,” she began, voice a warm drawl, “look at you all. My coven, punctual as always. I don’t think I’ve been on time for anything in my life, so it’s nice to know at least one of us has discipline.”</span></p><p><span>The comment section exploded in hearts and emojis. Agatha laughed, eyes dancing. “Alright, ground rules. Let’s set a boundary right now. I’m not here to give any more power to the pests buzzing around my life lately. You know who I mean. This livestream isn’t theirs to ruin. It’s ours. This is for you—for us. So, if you want scandal and gossip, go elsewhere. If you want sarcasm, bad jokes, and the occasional overshare? Congratulations, you’re in the right place.”</span></p><p><span>The flood of comments seemed to agree. Agatha relaxed back in her chair, tilting her head thoughtfully.</span></p><p><span>“Alright. Let’s see what you want to know. Ah—this one’s easy. Yes, filming for </span><em><span>Coven of Chaos</span></em><span> is underway. Yes, it’s bigger and wilder than anything we’ve done before. And yes, Wanda and I glare at each other so much that our director threatened to get us sunglasses. Apparently, it’s too much heat for one frame.”</span></p><p><span>The chat exploded with laughing emojis and heart emojis. Someone wrote: </span><em><span>“GIVE US SPOILERS”</span></em><span> in all caps.</span></p><p><span>“Spoilers?” Agatha gasped in mock offense. “You think I survived twenty years in this industry by giving away spoilers? Please. I don’t even tell Lilia.”</span></p><p><span>She leaned closer, lowering her voice conspiratorially. “But between us… There </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> one scene where I conjure something so outrageous, the stunt coordinator walked off set for a full fifteen minutes to pray. To what? I don’t know. Probably to Wanda.”</span></p><p><span>Her grin widened at the wave of speculation rolling in. “Oh, you’ll stew over that until release day. You’re welcome.”</span></p><p><span>Another comment caught her eye and made her bark a laugh. “</span><em><span>What’s your favorite sandwich?</span></em><span> That’s the pressing question of the hour? Not my skincare, not the arc of my career, sandwiches.” She tapped her chin. “Fine. Tuna melt. But not too much mayo. If you give me too much mayo, we’re fighting.”</span></p><p><span>The chat scrolled faster, fans debating her answer, some mock-outraged, others delighted. Agatha basked in it, letting herself sink into the easy rhythm she’d always loved with them.</span></p><p><span>“Okay, next, </span><em><span>what’s your guilty pleasure show besides Below Deck?</span></em><span> Hah! Bold of you to assume I feel guilt about Below Deck. But alright… reality confessional time. I am shamefully devoted to baking competitions. The ones where people’s cakes collapse and everyone gasps dramatically? My Roman Empire.”</span></p><p><span>She threw her hands up in mock despair. “There’s just something about a sponge cake deflating that soothes the soul. Therapy who?”</span></p><p><span>The room around her buzzed with energy, not just from the stream but from the presence off-camera. Rio leaned casually against the wall, arms crossed, watching. Always watching. Agatha’s eyes flicked toward her without thinking. And again. And again.</span></p><p><span>The fans noticed, of course. The comments began to swell: </span><em><span>“Why do you keep looking off-screen???”</span></em> <em><span>“RIO? WHERE IS SHE??”</span></em> <em><span>“We see you 👀”</span></em></p><p><span>Agatha laughed, caught. “Nosy, nosy coven. Fine. She’s here. Of course she’s here. Where else would she be? She’s glued to me like a very tall, very protective shadow.”</span></p><p><span>The chat immediately exploded with demands: </span></p><p><em><span>“BRING RIO IN”</span></em><span> </span></p><p><em><span>“RIOOOO”</span></em><span> </span></p><p><em><span>“LET US SEE THE HOT TATTED LATINA!!”</span></em></p><p><span>Agatha smirked, turning in her chair to face Rio. “They want you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shook her head instantly. “No.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned back to the camera with a sigh of mock tragedy. “See what I deal with? I get stabbed on screen ten times a week, but my greatest heartbreak is my bodyguard refusing to indulge me.”</span></p><p><span>The fans spammed harder, begging for Rio to appear. Agatha arched a brow at her girlfriend. “Carino, if you don’t at least come say hello, I may be forced to describe every single one of your tattoos in explicit detail.”</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned, muttered something in Spanish, and finally strode into frame. She perched stiffly on the arm of Agatha’s chair, clearly uncomfortable but too loyal to walk away.</span></p><p><span>The chat went feral.</span></p><p><span>“See? She exists,” Agatha said smugly. She nudged Rio’s thigh. “Say hello, darling. The people demand it.”</span></p><p><span>Rio gave the faintest nod. “Hello.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s it?” Agatha gasped. “You give Shakespeare-level protection every day of your life, and </span><em><span>hello</span></em><span> is all you offer? My coven, don’t worry. I’ll train her yet.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s lips twitched, the closest she got to a smile under scrutiny. “I’m not here to be trained.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, that’s a lie if I’ve ever heard one,” Agatha quipped, earning howls from the comment section.</span></p><p><span>Questions poured in now, dozens directed at Rio. Agatha scrolled dramatically. “Oooh, here’s one: </span><em><span>Rank your security team from most likely to survive a zombie apocalypse to least.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>Rio exhaled, resigned. “Natasha first. Then Bucky. Yelena. Clint. Alice. And I suppose I’d be last, since I’d throw myself in front of everyone else.”</span></p><p><span>The fans spammed crying emojis. Agatha smacked her arm. “Absolutely not. We’re banning martyrdom from this livestream. New rule.”</span></p><p><span>Another question flashed up. Agatha read it aloud, eyes sparkling. “</span><em><span>Rank your team from most likely to sleep with Agatha to least.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>Rio stiffened. “No.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, but it’s tradition!” Agatha teased. </span></p><p><span>“They are all in relationships; it's why I picked them for this team, so they don't sleep with you.” </span></p><p><span>The chat was flooded with disappointed fans at the fact that none of the security team is available, half the chat is screaming about how Rio picked people who wouldn’t sleep with Agatha, poking fun at the fact.</span></p><p><span>“Fine, I’ll answer. Ready? Rio, Alice, Yelena, Natasha, Clint, Bucky last because he’s very gay..”</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned into her hand. “You’re incorrigible.”</span></p><p><span>The comments lost their minds. Fans clipped it instantly, hashtags blooming in real time. Agatha only grinned wider, thoroughly enjoying Rio’s blush.</span></p><p><span>A question popped up that made Agatha smirk mischievously. She leaned toward the screen, voice dripping with delight as she read it aloud:</span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Are you single, Rio?</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>Rio froze for just a beat, her shoulders stiffening as though someone had drawn a bead on her from across the room. Slowly, she cut her eyes toward Agatha in a side glance she prayed was subtle. Of course, Agatha caught it instantly, raising one arched brow in challenge, smirk widening as she gave Rio her full attention. She was practically daring her to answer.</span></p><p><span>Rio exhaled through her nose, the corner of her mouth twitching. “No,” she said at last, voice low but steady. “I am happily taken.”</span></p><p><span>The comment section exploded like fireworks, messages flooding in so fast the chat box struggled to keep up. Some fans immediately began speculating who Rio meant. Others spiraled into heartbreak emojis and dramatic declarations of ruined dreams. Through it all, Agatha beamed like she just won the lottery, winking at Rio before pivoting back to the screen as if she hadn’t just set off an internet-wide meltdown.</span></p><p><span>Rio shook her head, but the faintest smile tugged at her lips. She hadn’t missed Agatha’s reaction.</span></p><p><span>Another question surged to the top of the feed: </span><em><span>“How many tattoos do you have, Rio?”</span></em></p><p><span>Before Rio could open her mouth, Agatha chirped, “She has twelve.”</span></p><p><span>Rio turned her head slowly, one brow lifting. The look on her face was half amusement, half disbelief. Agatha’s eyes went wide as she realized what she’d done. She gave a sheepish little wince that all but screamed, </span><em><span>Oops.</span></em></p><p><span>Rio let her stare hang there a moment longer before smirking, clearly enjoying the shift in power. She looked back at the camera. “Yes. She’s right. I have twelve. And no—” she added firmly, cutting off the inevitable flood of fan demands before they could fully take shape, “—I will not tell you what they are or what they mean.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha chuckled softly, leaning into her mic. “Mystery suits you, carino. But for the record, I </span><em><span>do</span></em><span> know what they mean.”</span></p><p><span>The fans went wild again, spamming caps-locked questions and frantic speculation. Rio only sighed and folded her arms, but she didn’t miss the satisfied gleam in Agatha’s eyes.</span></p><p><span>Other questions flew, what was Rio’s favorite meal (simple: Arroz con pollo), whether she’d ever lost a fight (she said no, Agatha corrected her with “except to me, darling”), and what the team was like off duty.</span></p><p><span>“They’re chaos,” Rio said flatly. “Loud, competitive, impossible to control.”</span></p><p><span>“Like siblings,” Agatha added, softer now. “The best kind. The kind who fight over pizza toppings but would burn the world if you so much as bruised them.”</span></p><p><span>Rio glanced at her then, and something unspoken passed between them. It was subtle, but the fans caught it. The chat scrolled faster than Alice’s firewall could blink. </span></p><p><em><span>“OMG LOOK AT THE WAY THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER!!”</span></em><span> </span></p><p><em><span>“MARRIED VIBES???”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“SECRET GIRLFRIENDS 100%”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“KISS! KISS! KISS! KISS!”</span></em></p><p><span>Agatha ignored the frenzy, though her smirk said she’d seen it. She tapped the screen. “Next question!”</span></p><p><span>This time, the questions took on a more curious tone. </span><em><span>“Rio, why did you become a bodyguard?”</span></em></p><p><span>Rio blinked, clearly not expecting it. Agatha tilted her head encouragingly.</span></p><p><span>“I was a soldier,” Rio said after a moment. Her voice was calm, clipped. “I served in the Special Forces. When I left, I still needed purpose. Protecting people gives me that. It’s simple. Direct. Someone tries to hurt my client, I stop them. That’s it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha rested her chin on her hand, smiling sideways at her. “Simple, she says. Like she hasn’t made it an art form.”</span></p><p><span>Another question rolled in: </span><em><span>“What’s one thing about Agatha we don’t know, but should?”</span></em></p><p><span>Rio hesitated. Agatha raised her brows. “Careful, darling. Remember, you live here now.”</span></p><p><span>Rio ignored her. “She hums when she cooks,” she said finally. “Sometimes it’s actual songs. Sometimes it’s just noise. She doesn’t even notice. But it means she’s happy.” Rio paused and then smirked before adding on, “Also, she can’t cook for shit.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s cheeks flushed, and the fans erupted with caps-locked screaming.</span></p><p><span>“Betrayed in my own home,” she deadpanned, but her eyes softened as she looked at Rio.</span></p><p><span>A fan asked: </span><em><span>“What’s the hardest part of your job?”</span></em></p><p><span>Rio’s expression flickered. “Convincing her to take her own safety seriously.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a mock gasp. “How dare you expose me like this to my own coven!”</span></p><p><span>“Truth hurts,” Rio said simply, and the comments cackled.</span></p><p><span>Another question popped: </span><em><span>“What do you do to relax, Rio?”</span></em></p><p><span>Agatha leaned forward eagerly. “Yes, please, tell us. Because I’ve never seen you relax once.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked faintly. “Gardening. Reading. Cooking, sometimes painting.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha whipped her head toward her, stunned. “Painting?! You’ve been hiding hobbies from me?”</span></p><p><span>Rio shrugged. “You never asked.”</span></p><p><span>The fans exploded. </span><em><span>“RIO THE ARTIST”</span></em> <em><span>“POST THE PAINTINGS”</span></em> <em><span>“BODYGUARD BY DAY, VAN GOGH BY NIGHT.”</span></em></p><p><span>Agatha was still staring at her like she’d sprouted wings. “This relationship is built on lies,” she muttered dramatically. “And I’m taking it to the court of public opinion, my coven.”</span></p><p><span>The chat sided gleefully with Rio.</span></p><p><span>They answered absurd fan asks for another half-hour, what Agatha would do in a bar fight (“win, obviously”), which Disney villain Rio secretly admired (“Scar, because strategy”), and whether Agatha could do a handstand (she attempted it on camera, wobbled, and nearly toppled into Rio’s lap, which sent fans into hysterics).</span></p><p><span>Finally, as the hour wound down, Agatha leaned closer to the camera. Her smile softened, all teasing tucked away.</span></p><p><span>“Alright, my loves. I have to wrap this up. But before I go, I want you to know that your laughter, your chaos, your constant presence in my life, it matters. More than you know. This livestream wasn’t just about answering silly questions. It was about reminding myself, and all of you, that joy is an act of defiance. And I refuse to let anyone steal it from me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laid a hand on her shoulder then, quiet support. Agatha covered it with her own, squeezing. For a moment, the camera caught it, the unguarded closeness, the affection they didn’t name but couldn’t hide.</span></p><p><span>The chat erupted, hashtags already being born. Agatha only winked. “And on that note, stay safe, stay kind, and don’t let anyone tell you tuna melt isn’t a proper sandwich. Goodnight, my coven.”</span></p><p><span>She clicked the livestream closed, the little red light vanishing.</span></p><p><span>The room was silent except for Agatha’s soft exhale. She leaned back in her chair, tilting her head at Rio. “Well, darling. Think I ruined your stoic reputation yet?”</span></p><p><span>Rio shook her head, but her lips curved. “No. But you made me love you a little more.”</span></p><p> </p>

<p>“You know the fans are going feral over the livestream last night,” Agatha smirked. She’d already seen thousands of clips and speculation threads dissecting every moment between her and Rio.</p><p>“Let them. I’m not worried about that right now,” Rio said, leaning on her elbow to look down at Agatha. “The Seven are going to feel cornered after Renna’s death and with Raven and Kyra in custody. Raven won’t talk, we’ve tried. She just sits there humming. I’m afraid they’re going to make a rash, dangerous move.”</p><p>“Let’s not talk about the Seven right now.” Agatha’s smile softened into something more dangerous. “You’re practically naked in my bed, and I have other things on my mind.” She tugged Rio down into a kiss.</p><p>Agatha and Rio were tangled under the sheets Rio’s mouth on Agatha’s neck when Alice barreled into the bedroom without knocking.</p><p>Rio moved before she thought, an old reflex, a muscle memory that had kept her and others alive more times than she could count. She was up in an instant, hand slipping to the concealed spot Agatha hadn’t known about. Rio’s posture tightened into efficient danger. Agatha’s laugh cut off, replaced by a sharp inhale.</p><p>“For fucks sake—” Rio started, then stopped when she registered who’d come through the door.</p><p>Alice was breathless, hair loose, laptop clutched like evidence. “If you do that again, I am stabbing you,” Rio warned, low and dangerous.</p><p>She folded the blade away and slid back onto the sheets, tugging the duvet up as Alice pushed forward and set the laptop between them. Agatha’s fingers threaded through Rio’s, hard enough to anchor but not to panic.</p><p>“Never mind that,” Alice said, words fast, voice already stripped to business. “We have a problem.”</p><p>Rio leaned in. Agatha sat up, hair mussed, eyes wide. Alice tapped the mousepad. Her face had the look she got when she’d found a smoking thread in a thousand pages of code.</p><p>“I’ve been watching the Seventh Veil accounts,” Alice said. “The same offshore channels that paid Ralph Bohner. Tonight, there was a transfer. One million dollars. It was split and routed into a network of accounts tied to mercenaries and assassins for hire.”</p><p>Rio closed her fist around the duvet. “You mean—”</p><p>“A bounty,” Alice finished. “They’re offering payment for delivery: Agatha alive if possible, dead if need be. The money’s been laundered through intermediaries, we traced the paths. There’s liquidity, handlers, and paymasters. Whoever did this has the funds and the channels to recruit quickly.”</p><p>Agatha went very still. The color left her face, but it was anger that came in, hot and immediate, not fear. “A million dollars,” she repeated, tasting the words.</p><p>Rio shot a look at Alice. “Who posted it? Where did it appear?”</p><p>“Encrypted boards, private channels, and a few broker feeds,” Alice said. “Seren’s been amplifying it, she’s pushing the message hard. We think she’s trying to make the Seven look lethal and resourced. But the money doesn’t just buy attention. It buys people who don’t care why, only that they’ll get paid.”</p><p>Rio folded the laptop closed with a snap. The bedroom door clicked and opened; Maria slipped in without fanfare, steady, composed, the kind of person whose presence brought order. Behind her came Sonya and Steve, rifles slung across their backs, eyes already scanning exits. Outside, the rest of the team were assembling like a machine: Bucky at the door, Natasha moving toward the study, Yelena circling the perimeter. Clint manning front gate. The house itself seemed to breathe in readiness.</p><p>“We keep this in-house,” Maria said. “No press. No public statements. We call in local law enforcement we trust and our SHIELD legal team to issue emergency freezes where possible. This stays between us and authorities who can help. No matter what, we do not let the Seven weaponize the public.” Her voice left no room for argument.</p><p>Agatha met Maria’s eyes and nodded once. “Good. I don’t want them to amplify this by crying wolf to the world.”</p><p>Jen, already at the foot of the bed with a tablet typed while she spoke. “I’ll freeze public appearances. No red carpets, no interviews. We go dark except for controlled productions that Rio and I approve. We won’t feed the hunger.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio said. She turned to Agatha, voice softer. “We’ll also rotate your sleeping location nightly for the next two weeks. We use decoys and duplicate routes. If they want you alive, we make you a moving target with no predictable pattern.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed Rio’s hand. Her jaw was a hard line, anger in every set muscle. “They exposed Colten’s image. They showed a dead soldier and turned it into a spectacle. They want to humiliate me, and they think by making it public they’ll win.” Her fingers tightened until Rio felt the pressure. “I’m not letting them win.”</p><p>Lilia’s text came through—<em>on my way</em>—and the house exhaled a small, collective relief. Wanda’s message followed: <em>Leaving set, I’ll be there.</em> Those two were the only ones not in the room; everyone else was already present, already moving.</p><p>Rio looked at each of them in turn, Alice, Maria, Sonya, Steve, Natasha, Bucky, Yelena, Jen, and Clint, seeing not just colleagues but the people who would be the edge between danger and safety. “We’ll need contingency teams ready to move if any of those cutout accounts light up with activity. Bucky, get me a rapid response: two vehicles, heavy plating. Natasha, work with local PD, only officers we can verify. We’ll need warrants ready if we get a lead.”</p><p>Alice nodded. “I’ll push everything to the task force. Maria can coordinate with federal liaisons to get emergency freezes on the shell accounts. We’ll hit the cash flow hard first. That’s the easiest choke point.”</p><p>“Physical precautions,” Sonya added matter-of-factly. “Reinforce the gates, add ballistic barriers at likely approach points, flood lights everywhere so they can't use the dark to sneak in, and position quiet surveillance teams in the trees.”</p><p>Rio let out a breath that was half frustration and half a steel-calm resolve. “We take the initiative. We don’t wait for them to pick a target. We draw them into mistakes.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at the laptop, then at Rio. “And when this is over?” Her voice was small, for the first time vulnerable beneath the armor of her fury.</p><p>Rio moved in, closing the space between them and wrapping both arms around Agatha. “When this is over,” she said, fierce and low, “you walk wherever you want, public or private, without me needing to hold my breath.”</p><p>Agatha leaned into the promise and for a sliver of a second the room felt less like a staging ground and more like a home. Outside, engines idled, radios beeped, people moved with practiced efficiency. Inside, the people who had come to protect her sealed plans that left no place for spectacle, only for safety.</p><p>Phones began to buzz in a sudden, ugly chorus, Alice had pushed something priority to every device in the house.</p><p>Rio’s screen lit first. Two new burner handles. Two new posts.</p><p>The first was short, the typography oddly childish for how venomous it read:</p><p><b>@Siren_call</b><b><br/></b> funny how you sleep with your eyes open, captain. can you save her from what’s coming, or will you fail like you failed valkyrie? tick-tock.</p><p>Alice’s reply pinged in a heartbeat later: <em>IP traces back to Seren </em>She did not need to say more; everyone knew the voice—mocking, petty, precise.</p><p>The second post slid in like a cold knife:</p><p><b>@motheroftheseven</b><b><br/></b> Snakes shed skin as they grow. I’ve grown while you grieved. Three steps ahead, always. We won’t stop until we have what we want.</p><p>No emojis. No flourish. It read like the Snake herself stepping into the light for the first time.</p><p>Rio’s jaw locked. Her thumb hovered over the glass. <em>You don’t get to use Valkyrie like a lever,</em> she thought. The rage felt hot enough to taste, but she pinched it down into focus.</p><p>Agatha’s phone chimed. She read both posts, then let out a short, humorless laugh.</p><p>“Obsessed, pathetic, and predictable,” she said. “If they were really three steps ahead, they wouldn’t need to announce it.”</p><p>“Announcing is the point,” Rio said, already turning to Alice. “It’s a pressure game.”</p><p>Alice’s fingers were already moving across the laptop perched on the kitchen island, multiple windows open, dashboards and command lines humming with information. “Seren’s trying to destabilize you,” she said. “The Snake wants credit for escalation, brand-building. If the Snake moves from boasting to ordering, we need to expect things to get much worse.”</p><p>A ping on the comms; Steve’s voice, measured and crisp: <em>Two incoming vehicles at the gate. Visual confirms: Wanda and Lilia.</em></p><p>Relief threaded through the room like fresh air. Wanda and Lilia’s arrivals were the calm center Agatha needed. The rest of the team tightened like a web being drawn taut, Bucky and Clint to the front hall, weapons at low ready; Sonya and Steve already moving to the gates. The house shifted, every motion practiced, precise.</p><p>Wanda stepped out of the Porsche first, hair loose from a hurried bun. Lilia followed, jaw set. Their hugs were full-body and immediate, no show, no cameras, just steady presence.</p><p>“You okay?” Wanda asked into Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“I’m furious,” Agatha said simply. “But very much alive.”</p><p>Wanda’s look flicked to Rio, sharp, seeing. Rio nodded once. No speech required: <em>She’s in good hands.</em></p><p>Another gate chime. Yelena’s tone crackled: “More friends coming, sisters, actually. I called in favors.”</p><p>They arrived not as a crowd but as shadows made flesh, three women in dark civilian clothes, walking with the quiet precision of predators who don’t need to announce themselves. Natasha introduced them without ceremony. “Zoya, Ina, Masha, old ties, and loyal. They’re here because we asked.”</p><p>Widows didn’t hug. They acknowledged obligations with a tilt of the chin. “We’re in,” Zoya said.</p><p>Rio pulled up a property map on the big screen. The house, the perimeter, approach roads, vantage points: the geometry of safety. She liked maps; they smoothed the panic into a plan.</p><p>“Sonya and Steve have north and south gates,” Rio said, sweeping her hand. “They rotate with Bucky and Clint every two hours. Natasha and Zoya take the west roof; Ina and Masha the east roof. Yelena stays mobile, perimeter sweeps, interior float, and rendezvous with me if anything breaks through.”</p><p>“And me?” Agatha asked, arms crossed, chin high.</p><p>“You’re with me,” Rio answered. “Always. If something happens to me, Natasha. If she’s compromised, Yelena. If the unimaginable occurs and the entire team goes down, Wanda and Lilia will evacuate you.”</p><p>Lilia, already at the desk, tapped a finger on a corner of the property feed. “I’ll coordinate civics. I’ll call local neighbors personally, ask them to watch, to call if something looks out of place. No posts, no cameras, just eyes and a phone call.”</p><p>Alice didn’t look up from the laptop. “Seren is baiting us, testing comms, seeing what we reveal when we react. She’s looking for noise. The Snake? She wants credit. My guess is she wants to force us to show our hand.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers drummed the edge of the map. “They’re testing. We expect probes. We also expect escalation. Maera will likely show herself. She’s the enforcer; she doesn’t care about symbolism, she cares about pay. If they bring muscle now, it’s because they want to see what we’ll do when threatened.”</p><p>A hush fell. Maera Rourke’s name carried weight, former military, ex-bodyguard who’d once been close enough to Agatha to know the rhythm of her days. Maera had no love for Agatha, but she had a price. That price was now on the table.</p><p>“And the rat?” Maria asked from the doorway, always two steps ahead in logistics.</p><p>“The infiltrator who rigged the light and trashed the trailer,” Alice said. “They used tech and access. We have reason to believe the rat might be close, maybe even local. If they send Maera to probe, the rat could try to slip in under the chaos.”</p><p>“Then we set traps for both,” Rio replied. “Maera is the muscle, visible and loud. We’ll make sure the gates and sightlines catch anyone approaching. The rat will go for blind spots, equipment rooms, service entrances, the catwalk.”</p><p>Agatha’s face grew hard with the same steel Rio carried. “If Maera shows up, she’s not doing this because she hates me. She’s doing it because she was paid to be indifferent. That’s easier to deal with.”</p><p>“Indifference is lethal,” Rio said. “But it’s calculable.”</p><p>“Maria, did we get permission to use lethal force if necessary?” Rio asked, turning to the commander.</p><p>“Yes. The FBI and local police have given us the go-ahead, but only as a last resort,” Maria replied. “If lethal force is used there will likely be a brief investigation to ensure it was warranted, but we should be cleared.” Rio nodded.. </p><p>They spent the next half hour refining, rings of defense, a rotation for guards, decoy routines so anyone watching would see patterns that were false. Alice set digital honeytraps that would look like vulnerable ports but were islands of lies. Yelena worked the physical tack: motion sensors angled at low points, Floodlights that illuminated the whole property, sound detectors that would flag a dropped tool. Sonya and Steve doubled the watch at the gate; A few trusted Cops would stage outward a block from the property to intercept any fast movers.</p><p>“If Maera comes, she’ll bring a crew,” Yelena said bluntly. “She’s not subtle. She’s the type to show up in a black truck and a smile. She’ll try to intimidate and buy access.”</p><p>“Which is why she won’t get either,” Natasha said.</p><p>Outside, the house breathed in. Teams took positions on roofs, windows, hedges, less like an army and more like a living, tense thing waiting to pounce if need be. People moved quietly, everything practiced, the rhythm of drills and the polish of repetition. The Widows melted into their posts like ink into water, present, potent, and silent.</p><p>Agatha’s hand found Rio’s wrist. “If they come with brutality,” she said softly, “I want them to know one thing.”</p><p>“What’s that?” Rio asked.</p><p>“That my life is mine, not their property.”</p><p>Rio looked down at her, the promise in her chest swelling. “Then we make them remember that.”</p><p>They checked each other: collars zipped, radios tested, batteries charged. Alice’s eyes flicked to the screens. “Seren poked the decoy; she’s watching to see whether we respond. If she runs the relay to any handler, we’ll get a trace. She’s getting sloppy without her sister.”</p><p>“And the Snake?” Maria asked.</p><p>“She’s enjoying the applause,” Alice muttered. “She wants the panic to feel like victory. But this, this is our floor. We don’t give them an audience.”</p><p>At the perimeter, Sonya and Steve adjusted night-vision sweeps. Sonya’s voice was blunt through the earpiece: “If Maera comes, she’ll look for an angle that hurts without touching us. She’s not a gardener; she’s a butcher.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth twitched. “Lovely. She sounds charming.”</p><p>“She is,” Rio said flatly. “And money makes harlots of us all.”</p><p>The house shifted into motion: a quiet choreography. Bucky and Clint walked the lines outside; Yelena and Natasha checked the interior camera feeds physically, with their own eyes. Alice had planted tracking pings in the decoy ports; Maria was lining up federal call-ins and paperwork so action could be instantaneous when the team had the right warrant. Jen organized the logistics, meals, rest rotations, everything that keeps people human in the ugly gray hours.</p><p>“Lilia and Wanda staying?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Lilia said from where she’d been cataloging neighbor contacts. “I’m here. I’m not leaving.”</p><p>Wanda’s hand found Rio’s shoulder in a quick, fierce squeeze. “Neither am I. If they think they can scare us into hiding, they haven’t met this coven.”</p><p>A horn announced a check-in from Bucky and Yelena; they were mid-sweep outside the far hedge. Alice’s laptop pinged again: <em>Seren’s relay partially compromised; tracing now, local nodes.</em></p><p>They finished their checks. The house didn’t sleep, but it settled into a dangerous, vigilant calm, bright screens, clipped radios, men and women who’d chosen to protect standing like pillars against the dark.</p><p>Agatha rested her forehead against Rio’s temple for a single, grounding breath. “Whatever happens,” she said, voice small in the flood of plans, “thank you.”</p><p>Rio’s hold tightened. “Always.”</p><p>Outside, shadows moved with intent. Inside, the people who loved Agatha made themselves a wall. And when the Snake and the Cicadas and the rest finally chose to come for them, they would find a house that did not cower. They would find people ready to answer force with calculated, ferocious defense.</p><p>The night stretched. The plan waited to be tested.</p><p>The first two nights were tense but manageable. A handful of low-level mercenaries showed up, lured by the bounty, but they barely reached the street outside before Sonya or Steve intercepted them. Two would-be “assassins” had tried to climb the gate, only to end up zip-tied on the sidewalk for the police to collect.</p><p>The third night was different.</p><p>Rio felt it in her bones before Alice called it over comms. The air outside was too still, too thick, as though even the neighbors’ dogs sensed something lurking.</p><p>Then Alice’s voice cracked over the comms. “We’ve got movement. Multiple heat signatures. Too many to count.”</p><p>Natasha’s eyes narrowed as she glanced at the monitors. “That’s not a probe. That’s an army.”</p><p>“How many?” Rio asked, her voice steady even as her stomach clenched.</p><p>Alice’s fingers flew over her keyboard, pulling camera feeds. “A hundred, maybe more. They’re coming from every direction.”</p><p>Rio swore under her breath. Rio toggled the all-call. “This is it. Sonya, Steve: hold the gates as long as you can and fall back on my mark. Bucky, Clint: outer intercept, make them bleed yardage. Widows: roof and flanks. Yelena: You're mobile.” Rio ordered “Agatha, Wanda, Jen, Lilia, Billy, living room, now. Stay low. Don’t leave unless I or Natasha come for you.” With that she ran off towards the roof.</p><p>Billy tried to argue “I can fight” but Wanda snapped, grabbing his wrist. “No. You stay with me.” Her voice shook, fear disguised as fury.</p><p>The living room felt too bright, too fragile. The sound of boots crunching on gravel carried in from outside, mixed with the crackle of radios and shouted orders. The normal quiet suburban street had transformed into a battlefield.</p><p>Agatha sat stiffly on the couch, her hands clenched in her lap. Jen hovered near by, Lilia clutched her wine glass like it was armor. Wanda’s arm stayed locked around Billy, her nails digging into his sleeve.</p><p>Below, the south tree line peeled open, dark figures moving in disciplined lines, not the sloppy jog of scavengers. Rio clocked mismatched kit, some plate carriers high-end, some thrift-store surplus, mercenary soup, but the coordination was tight enough to worry her.</p><p>“Fireteam One, two, three—mark your lanes,” Rio said, then squeezed her first shot. A forward scout folded, clean head drop. The south line staggered, then surged.</p><p>The attack came fast.</p><p>Mercenaries swarmed the gates, shouting, firing blindly toward the house. </p><p>On the roof, Natasha went surgical, two-round bursts, each pair more a sentence than a shot. Clint knelt stone-still beside a roof AC unit, firing on the exhale, calculating in slivers of breath.</p><p>Yelena didn’t settle. She was a dart, slipping from skylight to terrace to back stair, popping smoke where it funneled attackers, dropping flashbangs at the hedges to sow panic, then knifing the confused with efficient, brutal economy. Twice she vanished entirely, only for a merc to spin and crumple, a red line opening under an ear.</p><p>At the front gate, Sonya and Steve fought like myth, Sonya with her rifle tucked tight, stepping into recoil, Russian curses like a beat; Steve with that terrifying calm, double-tapping kneecaps and clavicles, so clean it felt like a clinic.</p><p>“Fence breach east,” Alice called. “Cutters on the third panel.”</p><p>“On me,” Ina said, already moving, Masha shadowing her. They hit the east fence like wind, Ina low and inside with a telescoping baton that shattered wrists; Masha up and over the fence line with a choke cable, dragging one climber down silent as a falling leaf.</p><p>Inside, the windows rattled as bullets pinged against the siding. Billy flinched hard at every sound, and Wanda pulled him close, murmuring, “It’s okay, it’s okay,” though her own voice shook. Agatha’s nails dug crescent moons into her palm, and Jen muttered prayers under her breath.</p><p>The mercs continued pressing relentlessly</p><p>“Fall back!” Rio barked. “Sonya, Steve, give me ten seconds and peel.”</p><p>“Copy,” Steve said, then tossed his last stun into a knot of bodies and dragged the iron crossbar shut by hand, buying those ten seconds with sweat. He and Sonya flowed backward, firing in the cadence of retreat: turn-shoot-move, turn-shoot-move.</p><p>Rio burst back inside, sweat glistening on her temples. “They’re pressing hard. We need to move you all somewhere safer.”</p><p>“Where?” Agatha asked, standing quickly.</p><p>Rio’s jaw worked. “The basement. It’s the most secure part of the house. No windows, one entry point.”</p><p>They moved quickly, Rio and Bucky flanking them as the others hurried downstairs. The sounds of shouting and gunfire grew louder upstairs. Every creak of the house made Billy jump.</p><p>“Mom,” he whispered as they crouched in the basement, “are we going to be okay?”</p><p>Wanda kissed his hair, eyes brimming. “Yes. You’re with me. You’re safe.”</p><p>Agatha leaned against the wall, trying to steady her breathing. “They won’t get through. They can’t.”</p><p>But the thud of footsteps overhead told a different story.</p><p>Upstairs, the Widows fought like shadows. Ina and Masha used wire and batons, slipping between doorways, striking and vanishing. Steve and Sonya held the entry hall, turning every doorway into a choke point. Natasha and Maria cutting down any before they can enter through the back.</p><p>Still, numbers wore on them. The mercs weren’t skilled, but they were relentless, throwing themselves at the house in waves. The wood frame groaned under the assault.</p><p>When the third wave hit, it hit everywhere. A garage window blew in, showering the Range Rover with diamonds; three mercs tried to pour through at once and met Clint’s blade before they found footing. In the library, two more rappelled through the skylight and landed in a snare Yelena had strung from curtain wire and stair banister; their guns clattered and one of them hung, strangling on his own web while Yelena rolled her eyes and cut him down to finish it properly.</p><p>Bucky stepped into the hall like a classical statue with a sidearm, elbowing one man’s barrel aside, punching the trachea, stepping into the next. Sonya vaulted a toppled chair and turned a double tap into a triple when she heard a second set of boots behind the first.</p><p>Natasha wiped blood from her arm where a bullet had grazed her. “They’re pushing too hard,” she hissed.</p><p>“They won’t break us,” Rio said. Her voice was steel, but her eyes flicked to the basement door. <em>Agatha.</em></p><p>That was when Alice’s voice broke in, sharp and panicked. “Someone’s inside. They slipped through the crawlspace.”</p><p>Rio froze. “Who?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Small, fast. Too precise to be random. It has to be the Rat.”</p><p>Rio swore. “Keep eyes on her. Don’t lose her.”</p><p>Downstairs, Billy shifted nervously. “I heard something,” he whispered.</p><p>“It’s just the house settling,” Wanda said, though her eyes darted toward the stairwell.</p><p>But Billy was right. A faint scrape carried through the dark, a sound that didn’t belong.</p><p>Then Hela Odinsson stepped into view.</p><p>She looked almost unchanged from years ago, save for sharper angles, colder eyes. Her lips curved in a smirk when she saw Agatha. “Hello, Aggie.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart stopped. “Hela,” she whispered. Her first love, the woman who broke her heart all those years ago. </p><p>Wanda shoved Billy behind her. “Stay back!”</p><p>Rio thundered down the stairs towards the basement, but Hela moved fast, slipping partly behind a support beam, her gun leveled. Her eyes flicked between Agatha and Wanda before settling on Billy.</p><p>And she smiled coldy.</p><p>The shot echoed like thunder.</p><p>Billy gasped, staggering back into Wanda’s arms. Blood bloomed on his chest, soaking her hands.</p><p>“NO!” Wanda screamed, cradling him, pressing frantically at the wound. “Billy! Stay with me, please, stay with me—”</p><p>Agatha froze, horror pinning her where she stood. “Oh god, oh god—”</p><p>Rio kicked the door down, firing toward Hela, but Hela was already gone, retreating into the crawlspace with a last cold smirk.</p><p>Chaos followed.</p><p>Wanda sobbed, rocking Billy as his breaths came shallow and fast. “No, no, you don’t get to leave me, not you—”</p><p>Jen collapsed to her knees, hands over her mouth. Lilia stood frozen, her wine glass finally slipping from her hand to shatter.</p><p>Agatha dropped to the floor beside Wanda, tears streaming unchecked. “Please, Billy, hold on—”</p><p>But his eyes fluttered once, then stilled.</p><p>The house went eerily quiet for a moment. Then Wanda’s scream shattered it, a sound of raw grief that clawed at the walls.</p><p>Rio crouched beside them, her face carved from stone. “I’m sorry,” she whispered. Her voice cracked. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Natasha’s voice broke over comms. “Mercs are pulling back. They’re retreating.”</p><p>“Maera’s with them,” Clint added grimly. “She’s seen and lost enough.”</p><p>Rio’s chest heaved, fury and grief warring. She touched Wanda’s shoulder, then Agatha’s, grounding them. “It’s not over,” she said softly. “Not yet.”</p><p>The night ended with blood in the carpet, smoke in the air, and Billy’s body lying still. Wanda was inconsolable, her cries echoing through the basement. Agatha held her, sobbing too, her own heart shattering as the weight of Hela’s betrayal, and her cruelty settled like lead.</p><p>Rio stood, staring at the crawlspace Hela had vanished through, her fists trembling. She had faced battlefields, buried her team, endured loss. But this, watching Agatha break, watching Wanda’s world shatter, lit something darker in her chest.</p><p>Hela wasn’t just the Rat anymore. She was a ghost from Agatha’s past, and now she had drawn blood.</p><p>And Rio swore she would not survive it a second time.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>Dawn came soft and gray, the sky reluctant to light the world after the night’s violence. The compound smelled like smoke and blood, and every surface seemed to hold its own small echo of yesterday: a scuffed boot print, the dent in the gate where the first breachers tried to wedge their way through, a smear of something dark on the gravel that Rio refused to look at too long. Inside, the silence felt like an accusation.</span></p><p><span>Natasha walked in first, a pad of paper in one hand, a makeshift bandage on the other where a grazing bullet had nicked her. She didn’t bother with small talk. “Final tally,” she said, voice thin. “One hundred and eight mercs dead. Twenty ran.” Her jaw worked like she was swallowing metal.</span></p><p><span>Rio closed her eyes for a breath and let the numbers settle in her chest like a stone. “Maera’s crew,” she said quietly. “She cut them loose.”</span></p><p><span>“Of course she did,” Yelena muttered, wincing as she sank into a chair and pressed the back of her hand to a split lip. “Cowards with contracts. They don’t sign up to die for pride.”</span></p><p><span>Clint sat with his side stitched and bandaged, rubbing at a wrist that still throbbed from where a blade had snapped skin. Sonya and a handful of the others were nursing shallow but ugly stabs and cuts; everyone wore the kind of exhaustion that reaches bone. They were breathing. They were alive. But the circle of life felt incomplete.</span></p><p><span>Wanda occupied a corner of the living room like a small, furious planet. She’d wrapped Billy’s jacket around her shoulders and wouldn’t let it go. Her face was raw from crying; now her eyes glinted with a terrible, bright fury. Lilia hovered, hands on Wanda’s back, murmuring something that sounded like a curse against God and luck and cruel people.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sat a little apart, hands clutching, jaw clenched so tight her knuckles were white. She had moved through the night like a dream; now that the adrenaline had ebbed, there were moments when her shoulders buckled and she had to breathe just to remember how to stand. Rio knelt beside her and threaded their fingers together. There was no elegant platitude she could offer that would fix this.</span></p><p><span>“He was just a kid,” Agatha whispered suddenly, as though saying it small might make it false. “He didn’t deserve—”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Rio said, voice steady but ragged. “No, he didn’t.” She turned and met Wanda’s gaze. Wanda didn’t look at her; she looked through her, at the hollow the boy left. Rio’s throat tightened at the sight.</span></p><p><span>Alice shut her laptop with a sound that cut the room. “You need to hear this,” she said. Her face was tight, not with adrenaline but with the brittle focus of someone who had just closed a file. “Jen and Agatha both named the rat, Hela Odinson. She’s the one who tampered with the light and broke into the trailer, and killed Billy. She was an assistant on sets, tried to be an actress, but never broke through, Disappeared for years, before being tied to a few violent crime organizations and rumored to be an assassin for hire.”</span></p><p><span>Hela. The name landed in the room and shifted the air. Lilia’s hand tightened on Wanda’s shoulder; she had a new look in her eyes: a slow, predatory grief that promised retribution.</span></p><p><span>“Daughter of Odin Odinson. Half-sister to Thor and Loki. Film dynasty. She’s got access and means, the kind money buys. She’s dangerous because she can walk onto sets like she belongs.” Alice explained. </span></p><p><span>A murmur threaded through the room. The idea that a child of movie royalty would trade red carpets for contract blades made everyone’s stomach drop.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s mouth moved before she could stop it. Small, breathless: “Hela… I —”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hand tightened. She’d seen Agatha last night and how she reacted to seeing Hela. Now, even grief couldn’t mask the old wound. “What’s her connection to you?” Rio asked softly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s fingers trembled. “She started as a stagehand. I remember her hands, messy with paint. She was quiet, always watching. We… we were together, long before any of this. I found her in bed with the director when I came to surprise her on our 3rd anniversary; she was the only woman I ever loved before you.” Agatha looked up at Rio with eyes that screamed heartbreak.</span></p><p><span>“That explains how Hela knew of the Crawl pace that wasn’t on any blueprints. She has been here many times when you two were together,” Natasha said.</span></p><p><span>“She knew Billy; they hung out and bonded over being goth and having famous parents.” Agatha's voice cracked, still not believing the woman she loved was responsible for taking the boy she saw as a son away from her. Wanda flinched and let out another sob.</span></p><p><span>The room grew very still.</span></p><p><span>Alice pushed a folder across the table. Inside were screenshots, grainy photos, the kind of evidence that was clinical until you read names on the byline. “We found a note on the wall outside,” she said. “It’s from Hela. She left it at the scene, almost like she wanted you to find it, Agatha.” Her voice was soft but precise. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s skin went cold. She opened her hand and read the folded scrap in a voice that sounded like someone else’s. Rio reached out and took the paper, read it too. Hela’s handwriting was sprawling, oddly elegant for a person who used her hands to fix things in the dark:</span></p><p><em><span>Agatha,</span></em></p><p><em><span>Do you still remember those first nights on set? When the world hadn’t yet decided you were its darling, when you leaned against ropes and flats and told me your dreams like they were secrets only I was worthy of keeping? I was a stagehand then, faceless, unimportant, but you looked at me like I mattered. For a moment, I let myself believe I did.</span></em></p><p><em><span>You loved me with a ferocity I did not deserve, and I will never let you forget that. You gave me everything, your trust, your laughter, even the way your hands shook when you thought no one was watching. And what did I give you? Truth? No. I gave you what I had: access, connections, a way forward you didn’t even realize you needed. I was always playing a longer game. I told you once that I never really loved you, and you believed me. But that wasn’t the whole story.</span></em></p><p><em><span>The truth is uglier, Agatha. I loved what you made me feel, but I hated you for it. I hated that the spotlight wanted you and not me. That your name was whispered with reverence while mine was traded in back rooms and on sheets that never smelled like love. I clawed my way through this industry, directors, producers, favors spent and wasted, while you floated above it all, radiant, untouchable. You rose because you were brilliant. I rose because I was ruthless. And still, you soared higher.</span></em></p><p><em><span>So yes, I cheated. I lied. I used you. Because in the end, everything was always about you, wasn’t it? And I couldn’t stand being a shadow orbiting your sun.</span></em></p><p><em><span>But don’t mistake me, Agatha. The years haven’t softened me. I don’t want your forgiveness. I don’t even want your love, not anymore. What I want is to remind you that everything you’ve built rests on fragile ground. That I can take from you what I once gave so freely: access, intimacy, the illusion of safety.</span></em></p><p><em><span>You should have left me in the wings where I belonged. Instead, you made me believe I could stand on the stage beside you. And for that, I will never forgive you.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Yours in envy,</span></em><em><span><br/></span></em> <b><em>Hela</em></b></p><p> </p><p><span>The paper trembled in Rio’s hand. There was love there, but it was crooked and hot with a green, clawing envy. Hela’s confession read like a map; the stagehand detail explained how she’d moved backstage with ease; the mentions of access explained why she could get into trailers and tamper with things. It was a lover’s letter and a threat both.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes were wet, and for a construction of many public faces, she looked suddenly small. “She says she loved me, but she never did. I should have seen her for who she was; many warned me about her, but I didn't listen.” </span></p><p><span>Rio’s fingers tightened around the paper until the edges went white. “She’s jealous, and she’s used her envy like a weapon.” She folded her head down for a moment, then lifted it. “We’ll use that. We’ll follow the path she left. Stagehands, production lists, and anyone who signed off on access for her. There are people on the film payroll who keep records. We’ll find them.”</span></p><p><span>Alice’s face, drained but furious, lit up behind her. “Good. Also, I froze every offshore account tied to the Seventh Veil; they’ve all been traced, flagged, and frozen. Those bounties were liquid; now they’re not. No more merc waves. Not on their money.”</span></p><p><span>A sharp, grateful huff sounded around the hungover room. Relief was short-lived but real. With the money trail cut, the cheap mercenaries were neutralized. It meant the rest of the attacks would be smaller, bloodier, and more personal. It also meant whatever remained of the Seven would escalate in other ways.</span></p><p><span>Outside, the world was already talking. Seren’s account, a blistering, petulant thread of posts and video rants, erupted an hour later. She posted a portrait of Kyra’s arrest with a caption like salt in a fresh wound: the pitiful, loud claim that if one of theirs fell, they would come back ten times worse. It read as a dare and a promise wrapped into one.</span></p><p><span>Rio scoffed bitterly. “She runs her mouth, but mouth alone can’t buy knives.” She tapped her comm. “Get me everyone who can open a line to Odin. Thor, Loki,  anyone with a name and a face. If Hela’s family has clout, they have records, payroll, and security. Someone will talk.”</span></p><p><span>Her military contact's answer came swiftly: “We have lines. The FBI will move in on Seren fast. She’s sloppy. She left metadata. We’ll have her tonight.”</span></p><p><span>True to word, an hour later, Rio’s contact called back. “FBI has Seren. They moved in at dawn. She’s in cuffs. She was vocal; she didn’t cover her tracks well.” The little victory was a cold one, a suspect in a small cell, scolding and defiant, but a step.</span></p><p><span>A low noise made its way through the room, not exactly relief, more an easing of pressure. They had blood, they had names, they had one less mouth breathing poison at large. But the hole that was Billy’s absence didn’t fill; it gaped.</span></p><p><span>Agatha pressed her forehead against Rio’s palm. The contact between them was a small, incandescent thing. “You won’t let them take another,” she said. It was a statement. It was also a prayer.</span></p><p><span>Rio swallowed an ache that had been waking with her for months, the old ghost of Valkyrie and the team she’d lost. “I promise,” she said. Promise had been the tool she’d used for years, binding it to duty and burying it in action. Now the promise had a name and a face: Billy.</span></p><p><span>Wanda rose, wiping at a face drawn taut with grief until she looked feral. “We go after Hela,” she said. “Not just for me. For Billy. For all of them.” She held Agatha’s gaze, and Agatha saw the steel in her friend’s face.</span></p><p><span>“We meet with the Odinsons,” Rio said. “We make them answer where Hela is. We keep the Media in the dark. We don’t play into their publicity machine. This is a law enforcement matter now; we don’t give it fuel. We have one more tool: Maria. She’ll help get us to the right MPs in the industry. Odin’s reach doesn’t make him invulnerable.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha’s mouth was a grim line. “And if they don’t cooperate?”</span></p><p><span>“We’ll make it costly,” Rio said. Her voice was not a threat; it was a plan. “But we’ll do it clean. We don’t become what they did.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned forward, voice small and steady. “Promise me something else.” She looked each of them in the eye, finally daring. “Promise me you’ll live. All of you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s face broke for the briefest of seconds, not with guilt this time, but with a ferocious affection. “I can’t promise none of us will get hurt,” she said honestly. “But I promise I will not let them take any more without paying tenfold. I will not lose another body to hate.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia stepped close and took Agatha’s hand, squeezing with a fierce tenderness that felt like armor. “He was all our son,” she said simply. “We’ll bury him and then hunt them until the earth opens under them.”</span></p><p><span>Their grief braided into rage; their rage sharpened into strategy. Alice tapped at her keyboard, pulling up production call sheets and payrolls. Natasha compiled the wound reports and patrol blind spots. Yelena, still scabbed but burning with the need to move, started paging through camera footage.</span></p><p><span>Outside, the sky lightened. The compound’s rubble looked paler in the new light. A small victory pushed through the haze, Seren in cuffs, the offshore accounts frozen, but the story had become personal in ways none of them wanted: a former lover turned enemy, an innocent boy taken, Hela’s handwriting folded like a blade in Agatha’s skin.</span></p><p><span>Rio stood, shoulders set, and looked across the room at the faces she’d chosen to protect. “Call Maria,” she said. “Set a meeting. Quietly. I want Thor and Loki in the room. I want Odin to understand what his daughter has done. And Alice, I want an audit trail, everything Hela touched. We trace it. We find her safe houses.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha squeezed her fingers around Rio’s and let herself sink back into the chair for a second, grateful for the warmth. “Then let’s burn the map,” she said, bloodied but unbowed. “Let’s show them we are not prey.”</span></p><p><span>Rio bent and kissed the top of Agatha’s hand, an intimate benediction. “Piece by piece,” she said. “We take them apart.”</span></p><p><span>Outside, things warmed. Inside, they arranged. They would grieve, and they would hunt. They would honor. They would not rest here, not while anything of the Seven still stood. And when Hela Odinson’s name passed across their lips, it was not only as the ghost of a lost love, but as a target.</span></p><p><span>They all went their separate directions, needing to mourn in their own ways, Natasha and Yelena thanked the Widows for their help and showed them out, they slunk back into the shadows and disappeared like they were never there in the first place. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio stood in the hallway outside the guest wing, hands flexing at her sides, the echo of gunfire and Billy’s last scream still lodged in her bones. She found Wanda sitting on the edge of the bed in Billy’s room, shoulders slumped, hands clasped tight in her lap. The proud tilt of her chin was gone, replaced by raw hollowness.</span></p><p><span>Rio lingered in the doorway for a beat, then stepped in. “Wanda.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda didn’t look up. “If you came to tell me you’re sorry, don’t.” Her voice was hoarse, but sharp. “I don’t want your guilt on top of my grief.”</span></p><p><span>Rio crossed the room slowly, sinking into the chair across from her. “I wasn’t going to say sorry.” She paused, pressing her thumb hard into her palm. “I was going to say it’s my fault.”</span></p><p><span>That made Wanda’s head snap up. Her eyes were red, furious in a way only a mother’s could be. “Don’t you dare. Don’t you </span><em><span>dare</span></em><span>. The only people at fault are those women. The Seven. Don’t you take my son’s blood onto your shoulders when it belongs on theirs.”</span></p><p><span>Rio swallowed, the words catching in her throat. “He was under my protection. Everyone in this house is. And I failed.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda surged forward, gripping Rio’s hand with surprising force. “No. You fought until you bled. You’ve kept Agatha alive through every attack, and you nearly got yourself killed doing it. Don’t stand there and carry my punishment along with yours. I won’t let you.”</span></p><p><span>For a long moment, Rio just stared at her, the soldier in her fighting against the truth in Wanda’s words. Finally, she exhaled, low and ragged. “Then how do you plan to survive this?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda leaned back, her eyes going distant. “I don’t know. I will scream until my throat bleeds, smash things until my hands split, and cry until my body gives out. And then, one day, maybe the pain will dull to something I can carry without choking on it.”</span></p><p><span>She closed her eyes, her jaw trembling. “But I can’t bury myself in anger and leave my husband and Tommy alone. So, I’ll do the only thing left: I’ll endure.”</span></p><p><span>Rio reached over and clasped Wanda’s shoulder. “Talk to Lilia.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda blinked at her.</span></p><p><span>“Talk to her,” Rio repeated softly. “She knows this pain better than either of us ever should. She’s carried the loss of a son every day since Colten died. She’ll know how to guide you through it. Don’t do this alone.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s eyes brimmed with tears, but she nodded, her lips trembling.</span></p><p><span>Rio squeezed her shoulder once more before standing. “Let one of us drive you home. You need to tell Vision and Tommy yourself. They deserve to hear it from you, not from whispers or headlines.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda bowed her head, silent, but after a long pause, whispered, “Thank you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio found Agatha upstairs in her bedroom. The actress sat curled in the corner of the bed, knees tucked under her chin, staring at the wall. Her hands trembled around a tissue, but she hadn’t cried, yet.</span></p><p><span>Rio closed the door quietly behind her, then sat on the edge of the bed. “My Love.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned her head slowly. Her eyes were swollen, her lips pale. “I keep hearing him, Rio. His laugh. His voice. And then the silence when he…when he fell.” Her voice cracked. “I promised Wanda I’d keep him safe. I promised.”</span></p><p><span>Rio reached for her, pulling Agatha into her arms. For a moment Agatha resisted, stiff with grief, then she crumpled against Rio’s chest, the sobs tearing free at last.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve got you,” Rio whispered, pressing her lips into Agatha’s hair. “Cry. Just let it out. I’ll hold you.”</span></p><p><span>They stayed like that for what felt like hours, Agatha clinging to Rio like a lifeline, Rio rocking her gently, eyes shut against her own tears. When Rio finally let herself cry too, it was silent, heavy, her chest aching as if it might split open.</span></p><p><span>In that room, with the weight of loss pressing down on both of them, they found something unspoken but undeniable: neither had to be strong alone.</span></p><p><span>For the first time since the fight, they allowed themselves to be simply two women mourning, bound not by duty, but by love.</span></p><p><span>And they wept together until exhaustion finally took them.</span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>Odin’s offices felt like a cathedral to power, glass and chrome and quiet money. The elevator doors opened onto a private floor where sound seemed to hush on command. Black-and-white photos lined the corridor: premieres, award nights, a century of cinema codified into a family’s legacy. In every frame, Odin towered at the center, a force wrapped in bespoke suits and cool judgment. Thor and Loki flanked him in different eras, golden and dark, sunlight and shadow.</span></p><p><span>Rio scanned exit routes, camera placements, the burly receptionist with boxer’s knuckles, the double security door that buzzed open after Maria’s name cleared. Bucky’s posture barely shifted as they walked, loose on the surface, taut beneath. Natasha’s eyes skimmed every reflective surface. Yelena looked bored, which for her meant razor alert. Clint drifted a step behind, too casual to be anything but dangerous. Alice stuck close to Maria, already plotting threads of network access with that fox-bright look she wore when a system dared her to try it.</span></p><p><span>The inner office was a study in understated restraint: a long walnut table, a wall of glass with the city dropping away beneath, a sideboard with crystal decanters that had probably witnessed more confessions than a church. Odin rose as they entered. He was older than his photographs, deeper lines, a silver beard trimmed like stonework, but he carried himself like gravity wore his name.</span></p><p><span>“Ms. Vidal,” he said. His voice was a low bell. “Ms. Hill.”</span></p><p><span>“Mr. Odinson,” Maria replied. “Thank you for making time.”</span></p><p><span>Thor and Loki rose beside him. Thor’s handshake was an earnest pressure. “We’re very sorry,” he said, voice softer than his frame suggested. “For the young man. We heard.” There was no press-release polish in the way he said it, just grief, plain and human.</span></p><p><span>Loki inclined his head, green eyes difficult to read. “Horrific,” he murmured. “And unforgivable.”</span></p><p><span>Odin guided them to the table. Rio didn’t sit until she’d checked every sightline. When she did, it was beside Maria, across from Odin, the table a neutral field that felt anything but.</span></p><p><span>“We can get to condolences after we get to the point,” Odin said, as if reading Rio’s impatience. “You’re here about Hela.”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn't preface. “Where is she?”</span></p><p><span>Odin’s jaw ticked once. “If we knew, you wouldn’t have needed to ask.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re her father,” Rio said, the question a challenge.</span></p><p><span>“By blood only,” Odin said. “We severed ties more than ten years ago. She was disowned. No trust, no contact, no access.” His tone left the door open to disbelief but closed it on excuses.</span></p><p><span>Thor’s hands knotted on the table. “He’s not dissembling.”</span></p><p><span>Loki rose, crossed to the oak desk, and retrieved a thin, black portfolio. He set it in front of Rio like an offering. “Last known aliases. Rehearsal spaces she favored. The accountants she leaned on. You’ll find breadcrumbs there.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky leaned forward, elbows on his knees. “Disowned for what?”</span></p><p><span>Odin’s gaze went to him and back to Rio. “Patterns,” he said. “Violence, manipulation, and an appetite for leverage. She learned to use people long before she had power of her own. When she touched ours… she preferred to shape it through pressure points.”</span></p><p><span>“People,” Loki supplied, simply.</span></p><p><span>“People,” Odin agreed.</span></p><p><span>Yelena clicked her tongue. “Charming.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha shot her a look that cut the joke off.</span></p><p><span>Alice’s voice cut in, factual and sharp. “Kyra and Seren were the Cicadas. Renna ran the online mess. Raven watched and followed. Maera handled the muscle. Hela has been the Rat, able to slip into places and break things quietly. We still need to find the Snake, the mastermind.”</span></p><p><span>Odin’s fingers steepled. “You’re not assuming the Snake is Hela.”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Rio said flatly. “Hela is a tool. The Snake speaks through tools.”</span></p><p><span>“Do you have a name?” Loki asked, voice lighter than the room felt.</span></p><p><span>“Not yet.” Maria’s planner was already open. “We have three paths. Seren and Kyra are in federal custody. Pressure them and see if they talk. Maera’s money trail is exposed; mercs make mistakes. And Hela, rats return to burrows. She will come back to a place she understands: a rigging house, a storage unit, a production office with a back door.”</span></p><p><span>Odin watched them for a beat. “Hela nests in people before she nests in places.”</span></p><p><span>The observation landed hard. Rio thought of the note they’d found, of Hela’s history with Agatha. She thought of the way access had always been Hela’s currency.</span></p><p><span>“Which brings us to the part you won’t like.”</span></p><p><span>“Say it,” Rio said.</span></p><p><span>“Hela remained close with Evanora,” Odin said. “Your client’s mother.”</span></p><p><span>The room stilled. A small, brittle sound escaped Alice, like air leaving a balloon. Yelena swore under her breath. Clint’s eyes went flat. Natasha didn’t move at all.</span></p><p><span>“Define ‘close,’” Maria said, voice tempered steel.</span></p><p><span>“Lunches,” Loki answered. “Sporadic calls. An envelope delivered now and then, a ticket, a pass, an invitation. Nothing illegal we could prove. But Evanora likes feeling important. Hela enjoys making people feel important when it suits her.”</span></p><p><span>Thor’s mouth compressed. “We tried to cut that tie when we cut ours. It clearly didn’t take.”</span></p><p><span>Heads turned. Evanora, Agatha’s mother, had been a window back home: a complicated, often cruel woman who had trafficked in favors and influence. She’d always been publicly hungry for relevance, and privately sharper. Maria’s voice held the careful tone of someone rehearsed in difficult truths.</span></p><p><span>“We need to bring Evanora in, very carefully,” Maria continued. “She’s been close with several people Hela used. She’s not the Snake, at least, we don’t have that proof, but she’s a door. She’s been useful to Hela at times, and their relationship is… fraught. Evanora has always hated Agatha, and she's made that known publicly many times. She pushed Agatha into compromises she refused. The motive, envy and control, lines up in a way that’s convenient for the Snake.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw tightened. A chill slid under her skin. It made terrible sense. Evanora had her own brand of cruelty: small humiliations dressed as lessons, invitations to bed, and power masked as mentorship. Agatha had described it before, how her mother tried to sell her younger self into favor, how she’d refused and been punished by neglect and public cold. If Hela used Evanora as a conduit, it would explain access to sets, to backstage passes, to the soft places in Agatha’s schedule.</span></p><p><span>“Is Evanora the Snake?” Yelena asked bluntly.</span></p><p><span>Maria shook her head slowly. “Not confirmed. But she’s a person of interest. She’s a vector. We loop her in very carefully: subpoenas, monitored contact. If Hela is using her, we’ll see the signal. If she is using Hela, we will see the signs.”</span></p><p><span>Odin’s voice was flat, but it carried weight. “If your inquiry requires legal cover,” he said, “our counsel will help. We will not leak Billy’s name or anything that weaponizes private grief. You have my word.”</span></p><p><span>Rio reached for the portfolio. As she did, Thor’s big hand rested briefly on the leather, stopping her, not to challenge, but to add weight.</span></p><p><span>“Ms. Vidal,” he said. “We cannot pretend this is just a professional matter. Hela… was loved by Agatha once. She will use that. And when she is cornered, she becomes reckless. Protect your client’s </span><em><span>heart</span></em><span>, too.”</span></p><p><span>The words were simple, and they landed like a stone thrown into Rio’s chest. She thought of Agatha’s trembling hands. The note Hela had left. Rio saw the order in the phrase </span><em><span>Don't let love be the breach.</span></em></p><p><span>They traded lists. Alice wanted server access, rehearsal logs, anything Hela might have ghosted through during her stagehand days. Maria would coordinate with authorities to get hard warrants. Odin promised private resources, investigators, contacts in the shipping industry, and historical badge logs from studios.</span></p><p><span>“There’s another truth,” Loki said, idle-mischief stripped from him. “Hela liked to be seen as the deserving underdog. She hated people who made it without her. Envy is a flavor she knows well.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky closed his hands into fists, then relaxed them into palms on his knees. “We need to keep it tight. No publicity about Billy. No leaks about the price the Seven put on Agatha. This stays between us and law enforcement. We’re not giving them oxygen.”</span></p><p><span>Maria nodded. “Agreed. We loop Evanora carefully. If she’s being used, we’ll see patterns: gifts, sudden tickets, voice calls, bank transfers. Alice, I want a forensics run on every contact point between her and Hela’s known aliases.”</span></p><p><span>Alice’s fingers were already moving. “On it.”</span></p><p><span>Rio looked at them all, feeling the old soldier’s checklist take over again: priorities, containment, leverage. She also felt something else, deeper and rawer: the knowledge that someone who’d once slept beside Agatha and lied to her face was now stalking the edges of their life. It was a cruelty of an intimate scale.</span></p><p><span>Thor stood. “One final note. If you need muscle in the field, tell me. I have resources that can clear an alley or hold a doorway.”</span></p><p><span>Loki rose with a small, sardonic bow. “And I can make a little mischief on your behalf.”</span></p><p><span>Yelena smirked. “As long as mischief involves knives.”</span></p><p><span>They left with plans: dossiers, subpoenas, old rehearsal logs to be scanned, storage facilities to be visited. Odin’s team promised discretion; Maria promised motion. Rio gathered the portfolio, feeling its weight like a map to where Hela might be hiding. The conversation had given them paths to walk, some legal, some sharp, some surgical. And a line in the sand: Evanora would be approached, but not trusted.</span></p><p><span>Outside, as they moved toward the elevator, Maria spoke softly, more to Rio than to anyone else. “We bring her in slowly,” she said. “If Evanora is innocent, she’ll be furious we suspected her. If she’s complicit, she’ll panic. Either way, we’ll see what she reveals.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded. “And Hela? We find her. We finish this.”</span></p><p><span>The elevator rode down. The city spread below like a board waiting for pieces to move.</span></p><p><span>They stepped into the corridor. The day outside felt harsher somehow, the light thin. But they had names, leverage, and a plan. They had allies who could open doors and others who could close them. They had a vow: no more surprises.</span></p><p><span>“Let’s go hunt,” Rio said.</span></p><p><span>And the team moved, out of the tower, into the city, carrying files like weapons and grief like a vow.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The terrace was quiet, the faint hum of the pool’s filter the only sound. The moon threw its silver light across the water, rippling against the tiles. Agatha sat curled in on herself, arms around her knees, sweater pulled tight despite the warm evening. She stared so hard at the pool’s shifting surface that she didn’t register the sliding door open behind her.</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped out, bare feet silent on the flagstones, and crossed to her. “Hey.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s head turned slightly, eyes dark and tired. “It’s her, isn’t it?” She overheard Maria and Natasha talking earlier about Evanora possibly being the Snake.</span></p><p><span>Rio sank onto the chaise beside her, careful not to crowd. “We can’t confirm, not officially. But the evidence is…” She exhaled through her nose. “It fits too well. The Snake.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a laugh, sharp, bitter, humorless. “I should have known. I should have </span><em><span>known</span></em><span> the second I heard the codename.”</span></p><p><span>Rio tilted her head. “Why?”</span></p><p><span>“Because she used it before.” Agatha’s voice broke. “Not to me, never to my face, but on sets, crews would whisper it. They thought it was a joke. Snake, viper, whatever. It wasn’t.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stayed quiet. She knew when Agatha needed silence more than questions.</span></p><p><span>Agatha rubbed her arms, nails biting through the sweater. “The first time she hit me, I was five. A commercial audition. I forgot a line. She smiled all the way home. Then she took off her ring and backhanded me with it. Told me if I wanted to be worth anything, I’d bleed for it.” Her laugh was ragged. “So I bled.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw locked, every muscle in her body tightening. But she kept her voice calm. “You don’t have to—”</span></p><p><span>“I want to,” Agatha interrupted, eyes fixed on the pool. “I need you to know.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded once.</span></p><p><span>“She’d dig her nails into my arms on sets if I flubbed a take. I still have scars. Once, I bombed a chemistry read, and she locked me in a bathroom stall at the studio. Told me not to come out until I’d cried hard enough to look like I cared. I was thirteen.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hand slid over hers, grounding. “Agatha…”</span></p><p><span>“At fifteen, I was done.” Agatha’s voice sharpened, brittle with old fury. “Lilia had started helping me by then, so I told Evanora I was finished. She screamed until her voice went hoarse, then laughed in my face. Said I’d come crawling back, that without her I was nothing. That I’d never make it unless I did what she told me: smile, sleep with the right people, sell my soul. I left and never looked back.”</span></p><p><span>For a moment, her mask cracked, tears glinting in her lashes. “But I should have known. Snake. Viper. It was all right there. I should have known she’d never stop trying to destroy me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio finally moved, shifting closer until she could frame Agatha’s face in her hands. Her thumbs brushed away tears that hadn’t yet fallen. “Listen to me. You cut her out when you were barely more than a child. You survived her. And now you’ve built a life she’ll never touch, no matter how hard she tries. That isn’t her victory, Agatha, it’s yours.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha met her gaze, something fierce and broken all at once in her eyes. “She was supposed to love me, Rio. Not—” Her voice cracked. “Not this. Not… this.”</span></p><p><span>Rio pulled her into her chest, arms wrapping tight, protective. “She didn’t know how. But that’s not on you. That’s on her.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha clung to her, pressing her face into Rio’s shoulder like she could hide there. For a long time, neither spoke. Just the sound of their breathing and the quiet lap of water against tile.</span></p><p><span>Finally Agatha whispered, muffled, “I hate that I still care. That some part of me still wants her to say she’s proud of me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio kissed her temple. “That’s the little girl in you talking. The one she hurt. You don’t owe her your care, mi amor. You don’t owe her anything.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha pulled back enough to look at her, eyes wet but blazing. “Then help me end this. If she really is the Snake, if Evanora is behind all of this, I don’t want mercy. I don’t want understanding. I want her stopped. For good.”</span></p><p><span>Rio searched her face, seeing the rawness there, the steel underneath. She nodded slowly. “Then that’s what we’ll do.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled, a shudder leaving her body. She pressed her forehead to Rio’s again, drawing strength from the closeness. “You’ll stay with me, right? No matter what comes next?”</span></p><p><span>“Always,” Rio promised, and for once, it didn’t feel like a vow weighed down by guilt or failure. It felt like the truth.</span></p><p><span>They stayed like that for a long while, two women bound by pasts that refused to stay buried, and by a present they refused to give up. The stars wheeled overhead, silent witnesses.</span></p><p><span>When Agatha finally pulled back, her voice was steadier. “I cut ties with her at fifteen. I thought that was the end. But if she wants a war, Rio, she picked the wrong daughter to underestimate.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s lips curved, fierce and proud. “That’s the Agatha I know.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let herself smile, tired, aching, but real. And for the first time in days, the fire in her chest burned brighter than the fear.</span></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>News of the attack on Agatha’s home, and Billy’s death, had yet to break in the days that followed. Jen, Maria, and the Odinsons were working overtime to keep it quiet, pulling every string they had to delay the inevitable storm. But silence only stoked curiosity. The media and fans were already speculating, noting the heavy increase in security, the rare absence of Agatha’s public presence, and the sudden hush from people usually so active. The world could feel something was wrong.</span></p><p><span>Inside the house, grief hung thick in the air. Wanda sat curled on the sofa in the living room, her hand entwined with Vision’s, her face hollowed by days of crying and sleepless nights. Vision, usually a man of calm composure, looked frayed, his arm tight around her as though holding her together with sheer will. On the other side of the couch sat Tommy, staring blankly at the wall. His eyes were red, but he wasn’t crying anymore. It was as if something inside him had shut down, leaving only a shell behind.</span></p><p><span>No one spoke for a long while. The silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the occasional creak of the old house settling. Finally, Wanda’s voice cut through the stillness, low but steady, fueled by a mix of sorrow and fire.</span></p><p><span>“We’ve decided to put out a statement,” she said, her tone leaving no room for argument. “Billy’s funeral is tomorrow. The public needs to know. I want them to know that my baby boy was murdered. I don’t care about speculation, I don’t care about backlash, I want it known. What I will not allow is for his life, or his death, to be reduced to whispers and rumor.”</span></p><p><span>Her eyes flashed dangerously as she looked around the room, daring anyone to contradict her. No one did. Even Agatha, who sat with her knees pulled to her chest near the fireplace, only lowered her gaze in sorrowful agreement.</span></p><p><span>Rio was the one to answer, her voice calm but resolute. She sat forward in her chair, elbows braced on her knees, the weight of command heavy in her posture. “Hela already knows we’ve unmasked her,” Rio said evenly. “She’ll likely move to release her own narrative soon, the same way we put names to the others. That choice is yours, Wanda. Whatever you decide, my team will adjust and protect around it. The only thing we ask, what has to remain hidden, is the identity of the Snake. Evanora cannot know she’s been identified. If she spooks and disappears into the shadows, we may never get another chance to bring her down.”</span></p><p><span>The words hung in the air like a warning bell. Wanda’s fingers tightened around Vision’s hand, and Vision pressed a kiss to her temple, murmuring something too quiet for anyone else to hear. Tommy’s jaw clenched, his first flicker of reaction in hours, and for a moment, the resemblance to Billy was so stark it broke Agatha’s heart all over again.</span></p><p><span>No one argued with Wanda’s grief, but everyone understood Rio’s warning: in a war fought from the shadows, one misstep could cost them everything.</span></p><p><span>“It will be smart for Rio and Agatha to also put out statements of their own,” Jen said, her voice hoarse from days of crying. Agatha and Rio nodded. </span></p><p><b>Wanda’s Statement</b></p><p><em><span>My son, Billy Maximoff, was murdered.</span></em></p><p><em><span>I will not soften it. I will not dress it up for comfort. He was taken from me—taken from us—by a group of cowards hiding behind masks, shadows, and lies. They want silence. They want fear. They will get neither from me.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Billy was light. He was laughter that filled a room, kindness that made people better just by knowing him.

We stand against all forms of violence and harassment.</span></p><p><span>Agatha, curled into Rio’s side on the couch, sat up a little straighter. “What are they saying?”</span></p><p><span>Jen scrolled, scanning her feed. “Here’s </span><em><span>The Times</span></em><span>: </span><em><span>‘Never in Hollywood history has a single residence been targeted with this scale of force, and survived. Agatha Harkness’ security team repelled what sources describe as over one hundred trained mercenaries, making this one of the largest single-site counter-assaults on U.S. soil in recent memory.’</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>Natasha, standing by the fireplace with arms crossed, let out a sharp exhale. “They’re not wrong.”</span></p><p><span>Jen flicked to another article. “</span><em><span>The Guardian</span></em><span> is calling it ‘a near-mythic defense led by Rio Vidal, whose reputation as a private security executive now borders on legendary.’ They’re comparing it to war reports. Not film news. War reports.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw tightened. “They’re not wrong to be stunned. But we don’t want this turning into some gladiator headline. We lost Billy. That’s the only thing people should be focused on.”</span></p><p><span>Jen softened, lowering the phone. “I agree. But the press is painting this as something no one’s ever seen before. The idea that a celebrity’s home was attacked like a military target? And survived? Journalists don’t even have a frame of reference. They’re calling it ‘unprecedented,’ ‘historic,’ ‘borderline cinematic.’ And all eyes are on us now.”</span></p><p><span>The room fell silent, the weight of her words pressing down like an unwelcome guest.</span></p><p><span>The next morning came heavy, gray skies pressing low over the house like the world itself knew what day it was. The air was thick with quiet, the kind of silence that settled into the bones. No one needed to be told what today was.</span></p><p><span>Upstairs, Agatha sat at the edge of the bed, staring at the black dress laid out across the blankets. She hadn’t worn anything so stark in years. Her hands trembled faintly, not from fear, but from the weight of grief pressing down on her chest. She felt the mattress dip as Rio came out of the bathroom, hair slicked back, already dressed in her suit. No tactical vest, no weapons visible, just black fabric stretched over her tall frame, neat and understated. Still, she looked like steel forged into human form.</span></p><p><span>Rio knelt in front of her, wordless for a moment, before reaching for Agatha’s hands. “Mi vida,” she murmured, her voice low, steady, grounding. “We’ll get through today.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked, the sting of tears threatening, but she held them back. Instead, she cupped Rio’s jaw, thumb brushing over her cheekbone. “I don’t know how Wanda is still breathing,” she whispered. “If I lost—” She stopped, unable to finish.</span></p><p><span>Rio pressed her forehead to Agatha’s. “Don’t,” she said softly. “We can’t go there. Not today. Today we stand with Wanda. With Billy.”</span></p><p><span>It was enough. Agatha leaned into her, pressing a lingering kiss to her lips before finally rising. Rio helped her into the dress, smoothing the fabric over her shoulders with a tenderness that made Agatha’s chest ache. By the time she slid on her coat and heels, she felt steadier, not whole, but anchored.</span></p><p><span>Downstairs, the rest of the team moved through the motions with a kind of reverent silence. Natasha adjusted her cuffs with sharp, precise movements. Bucky stood near the window, eyes distant, his suit fitting him like a uniform. Clint fussed with a tie he clearly hated. Alice sat at the kitchen counter, glasses perched on her nose, hair pinned back, for once not glued to her laptop. Even Yelena, usually all sharp humor and snark, was quiet as she laced her boots, jaw set.</span></p><p><span>Jen and Lilia were waiting near the door, both dressed in black. Lilia clutched her bag like it was armor, her expression unreadable but her eyes rimmed red. Jen looked exhausted, but resolute, a clipboard in hand as if paperwork might keep her from breaking apart.</span></p><p><span>When Agatha and Rio entered, the group looked up. No one said anything, but the silence shifted, softened. Agatha offered a small, trembling smile. “Let’s go.”</span></p><p><span>Outside, the air was brisk, biting. Two black SUVs waited in the driveway, engines rumbling low. Sonya and Steve stood at the gates, rifles slung but dressed respectfully, nodding solemnly as the team approached. Wanda’s security will join them today, stationed discreetly along the road with local cops marking the perimeter of the Church. It wasn’t a military operation today, though it felt like one. It was a funeral.</span></p><p><span>Rio opened the door for Agatha, steadying her as she climbed in. Their fingers lingered together until the last possible second, a lifeline in the storm. Wanda and Vision would meet them at the church, along with Tommy and the few friends they’d chosen to let inside their grief.</span></p><p><span>As the SUVs pulled out of the drive, the house shrank behind them, its walls still scarred from the siege that had stolen so much. Agatha leaned into Rio’s side, her voice barely above a whisper. “We’ll honor him today. That’s all that matters.”</span></p><p><span>Rio wrapped an arm around her, pulling her close, her jaw set, her eyes locked on the road ahead. “We’ll honor him,” she said. “And we’ll make sure he’s never forgotten.”</span></p><p><span>No one else spoke. The engines hummed, tires rolling over wet pavement, carrying them toward a day none of them wanted but all of them would endure, together.</span></p><p><span>The chapel was small and white-washed, tucked back from the street behind a fringe of oaks that rattled softly in the wind. Someone had draped black ribbon along the railings and set lanterns at the steps; their glass panes held the gray morning like little squares of sky. Inside, the air smelled faintly of old wood and lilies. Candles burned along the side aisles in neat rows, tiny constellations trembling in the draft each time the door opened.</span></p><p><span>They kept the front pew for the family. Wanda and Vision sat in the center, fingers locked so tightly their knuckles were white. Tommy was on Wanda’s other side, shoulders hunched, the brim of his black cap pulled low like a child trying to disappear. Agatha slid in behind them with Rio, one hand resting lightly between Wanda’s shoulder blades in a silent, steadying circle. The team took the pew behind. Natasha, Bucky, Clint, Alice, Yelena, dark suits and solemn faces, eyes moving with the trained awareness that never quite turned off. A few rows farther back, Jen folded a program into a soft fan and didn’t seem to notice she was doing it. Lilia sat beside her, hands clasped in her lap around a handkerchief she hadn’t yet used.</span></p><p><span>The church filled quietly: producers, grips, hair and makeup artists, studio publicists, neighbors, a couple of old school friends of Billy’s that Vision had tracked down. No cameras inside, Wanda’s single hard condition, and the ushers were gentle but firm about phones. Outside on the sidewalk, a cluster of fans kept vigil behind sawhorse barricades, holding flowers and homemade signs: </span><em><span>We love you, Billy.</span></em> <em><span>Thank you for being kind.</span></em> <em><span>For Wanda, for Agatha, for family.</span></em><span> A few of them cried openly. Sonya and Steve coordinated with local police to keep the street calm.</span></p><p><span>When the organ began, it did so softly, as if it, too, was careful not to jar the room. A simple melody, the kind you could hum without realizing it, rose to the rafters and diffused through the candlelight. The officiant wasn’t a priest; she introduced herself simply as Elise, someone who did a lot of “life ceremonies” for people who didn’t fit neatly into boxes. She welcomed everyone, acknowledged the unimaginable, and made space for whatever each person believed. “Grief,” she said, “is the price love is willing to pay. But love is patient. It will stay with you even when the grief feels like a storm that won’t end.”</span></p><p><span>A slideshow began on a canvas screen—no dramatic sound, just the whisper of the projector. Billy at five, missing teeth, holding a sparkler. Billy at twelve with a skateboard, scraped knees and a crooked grin. Billy at nineteen at a wrap party, confetti stuck in his hair. Billy handing Agatha a bottle of water at a scorching premiere, fussing over her collar. Billy singing badly into a hairbrush while Jen filmed and laughed so hard the camera shook. Each picture bloomed and faded. Sometimes the chapel laughed, softly, like a ripple over stones. Sometimes it hushed all at once, particularly when an image of Billy with Wanda and Tommy appeared—mother, sons, cheeks pressed together, the easy warmth of family filling the frame.</span></p><p><span>Wanda stood when it was her turn to speak. Rio felt Agatha’s breath catch beside her. The podium looked too big under Wanda’s hands, and for a moment she simply rested her fingers on either side of it, gathering breath. The room went very still.</span></p><p><span>“My son,” she said, and the words were both introduction and invocation. Her voice was hoarse but steady, the kind people get when they’ve sobbed as much as a body can and somehow found another layer of strength. “Billy… was the person you called when you locked yourself out, when you forgot a birthday, when you needed someone to tell you the truth even if you didn’t want to hear it. He was gentle, but not fragile. He was funny, but never unkind. He loved music. He loved cooking disasters, he once tried to flambé pancakes, and we lost a perfectly good curtain. He loved his brother with a fierceness that made me feel like I’d done at least one thing right.”</span></p><p><span>A soft, watery laugh traveled the pews. Wanda’s mouth tilted; she kept going.</span></p><p><span>“On sets, he collected strays. You know who you are.” A few people smiled through tears. “He took care of me, even when I was supposed to be taking care of him. That’s who he was. Light in the hallway. Arms when you thought you were falling. He wasn’t famous, but fame never had anything to teach him. He already knew the important things.”</span></p><p><span>She paused, blinked hard, swallowed.</span></p><p><span>“I am grateful,” she said, and the word seemed impossible in her mouth and yet here it was. “For twenty-two years. For every version of him I got to know, every joke he told that didn’t land, every hug that did. I am angry. I am broken. I am also not alone. He made sure of that, he built us into each other so that when one of us falls, the others remember how to help them stand. Thank you for loving my boy. Please keep saying his name.” She looked out over the chapel; the force of will in her gaze was almost a tangible thing. “He is not a headline. He is not content. He is our Billy.”</span></p><p><span>She stepped down, and Vision rose, catching her hand. They kissed each other’s knuckles like it was a vow they’d made long ago and needed to remember how to say it again. Tommy stood briefly, murmured, “He stole my hoodies,” and then sat fast with his face in his hands. The room didn’t laugh—didn’t dare—but it softened, the way a hand softens when it holds something delicate.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t realize she’d stood until she was already halfway down the aisle. Rio glanced up once, and the look they shared—</span><em><span>I’m here</span></em><span>—was enough to set Agatha’s spine. At the podium, she laid her palms flat and exhaled through her nose, as if steadying a line on a stage she’d delivered a hundred times and then rewritten the night before.</span></p><p><span>“I remember when Billy was twelve,” she began, looking out at Wanda, Tommy, Vision. “I was visiting Wanda on set and he was so bored he could have faded through the floor. He asked me if acting was just pretending to pretend. I told him that was what most bad acting was, yes.” A ripple of laughter. “He didn’t blink. He said, ‘Then you’re good at the real kind.’ He was right.” She lifted a shoulder. “He usually was.”</span></p><p><span>Her smile flickered. “He became my assistant because he was already my shadow. He knew when I needed to take a break before I did. He knew where my spare charger lived. He knew how to make me eat when I was all nerves and no appetite. He knew how to tell me no. Not many people can do that and survive.” A breath, a crowd-smile. It faded. “He was my family. Not because of blood, but because of choice, and constancy, and care. I was there when he was born. He’ll be with me when I die.”</span></p><p><span>She looked down for the first time, then back up, eyes bright. “I don’t have a lesson. I don’t have a neat bow. I have love, which is messy and greedy and refuses to end when the person you love does. I have gratitude for every minute I got with him. And I have a promise.” She turned slightly toward Wanda. “We will carry him. All of us. We’ll say his name. We’ll keep his joy moving through rooms like a breeze you can’t see but feel anyway.” She swallowed. “I love you, Billy. Thank you for choosing me.”</span></p><p><span>When she returned to the pew, Rio’s hand found hers and didn’t let go. For a moment, Agatha leaned into her shoulder, a quiet collapse she didn’t allow herself often. Rio angled closer, shielding her from the sightlines of the room without making a scene of it.</span></p><p><span>The officiant invited anyone else who wished to share. A lighting tech told a story about Billy learning every crew member’s name on day one. A hair stylist confessed he once sang karaoke at wrap because Billy bribed him with cupcakes. Jen spoke about how he’d quietly mailed flowers to a fan who’d lost her dad and never told anyone about it. The chapel held their laughter and their tears like they were both sacred.</span></p><p><span>Music again. Not a hymn, an acoustic guitar and a voice from the back that sounded like smoke at the edge of a fire, singing about carrying light across dark water. It didn’t overreach. It didn’t try to fix anything. It simply moved through the space and gave people a place to put what they were holding.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t intend to speak. She wasn’t in the program. But when Elise asked whether anyone who had protected Billy wanted to say a word, Agatha’s hand squeezed, and Rio felt something unlock in her chest.</span></p><p><span>She stood because soldiers stand, even when their legs aren’t sure. The aisle seemed long; she wasn’t built for altars and microphones. She took the podium the way she took a perimeter, quietly, respectfully, eyes scanning before she set them down on the family.</span></p><p><span>“I don’t… do this,” she said, almost apologetic. “But I owe him a few words.”</span></p><p><span>Her voice was low, steady, the kind that made people lean in.</span></p><p><span>“I protect people for a living. Sometimes, I fail.” The words twitched; she stilled them. “That failure is a burden I carry and will keep carrying. But I want to say this: when the worst thing happened, Billy was brave. He did not run from other people’s fear. He stepped toward it. He looked for who needed him. That’s not weakness. That’s the bravest thing I know.”</span></p><p><span>She drew a breath, let it out through her nose. Her eyes flicked to Wanda and Vision. “You raised a good man. The kind this world can’t afford to lose and can’t stop remembering.” She hesitated, then allowed herself the smallest softening. “I will spend the rest of my life making sure the people who did this never do it again.” She dipped her head, simple and sincere, and stepped down.</span></p><p><span>On her way back, she passed Natasha in the aisle. Nat didn’t speak; she just caught Rio’s wrist for a heartbeat, a wordless </span><em><span>you did right</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>The service closed with something Elise called a “litany of names.” She read a line about light, and the congregation answered with “We remember,” each time Billy’s name was spoken. People rose, one by one, to light candles at the side rails. Wanda went first, Vision with her. Tommy followed, lips pressed tight, eyes wet but not spilling. Agatha lit two, one for Billy, one for the version of herself that had known him since he was born, and would have to learn how to walk without him. Rio lit one and didn’t say what it was for. She didn’t have to.</span></p><p><span>Outside, the sky had cleared to a pale, soft blue. The fans behind the barricades were quiet, as if the tone of the day had seeped into the street. When Wanda stepped out, a hush fell that felt like respect, not voyeurism. Someone began to hum the tune from inside. Others joined; it drifted across the asphalt like a prayer no one had to agree on to share.</span></p><p><span>At the graveside, small cemetery, low stone wall, sunlight splintering through leaves, the circle drew closer. There was no long sermon. Elise read a few lines Wanda had chosen: about love being the thing that death can’t steal; about memory being a kind of second life. People placed flowers on the lid, simple stems, not arrangements. Agatha’s was a purple iris. Rio’s was a white lily she hadn’t planned to bring; one of the ushers had pressed it into her hand at the chapel door, as if he’d seen something on her face and knew she needed something to set down.</span></p><p><span>When the first shovelful of earth landed, the sound was softer than Agatha expected. She flinched anyway. Rio’s palm settled at the small of her back. </span><em><span>I know.</span></em><span> It said enough.</span></p><p><span>The reception afterward was in the church hall—folding tables draped in black cloth, coffee urns, sandwiches no one was hungry for and ate anyway because the body needs something to do when the heart is trying to remember how. People told stories in clusters. There was laughter, real and high, the kind that bursts out when grief has wrung a person dry and the smallest shard of joy finds a crack. Wanda didn’t leave the corner where she and Vision sat; people came to her in a gentle queue, each one taking her hand and pressing it, speaking briefly, moving on to make room. Tommy hovered near the cookies and didn’t touch any.</span></p><p><span>Rio stayed close to Agatha without hovering, moving with that quiet awareness that made people unconsciously part around her. She didn’t need to check exits; Natasha and Clint were already placed. Yelena made a show of eating three cookies and glaring at anyone who looked like they might tell her to stop. Alice positioned herself near the door with two uniformed officers, speaking quietly, trading names. Every so often, Sonya’s voice crackled in Rio’s earpiece from the outer perimeter: </span><em><span>Street’s calm. Crowd respectful.</span></em></p><p><span>Jen eventually perched on the edge of their table with her phone face down. “I’m not taking calls today,” she announced, voice wrecked. “Anyone who needs a quote can read the statements and let that be enough.” No one argued.</span></p><p><span>Lilia arrived with a small frame under her arm—a candid photo of Billy and Agatha from years ago, heads thrown back, laughing at nothing. She set it beside the coffee urn like an altar and, for the first time all day, smiled.</span></p><p><span>The formal goodbyes stretched into the slow dissolving that always happens when people don’t want to be the first to leave because leaving means the day is over and the person is still gone. At last, Wanda rose. Rio saw the way Agatha straightened instinctively. The two women met in the center of the room and folded into each other, no words, foreheads pressed together as if to share breath. Rio looked away, not because she was shut out but because some things are for the people inside them alone.</span></p><p><span>When it was time to go, the team formed around Wanda’s family and Agatha without being asked. Outside, the air had warmed. The fans were gone; the police had cleared the street to give the families privacy. The SUVs lined the curb like punctuation marks ending a sentence no one wanted to write.</span></p><p><span>At the curb, Wanda hugged Agatha once more and then turned to Rio. For a suspended second, grief and gratitude braided together in her eyes. She reached out, squeezed Rio’s hand hard enough for bone to remember it, and nodded. No promises either of them could make would bring Billy back. But some promises could still be kept.</span></p><p><span>In the car, Agatha’s head found Rio’s shoulder almost immediately. The hum of the engine, the rhythm of the tires, the low murmur of Clint and Alice in the lead vehicle over comms, all of it layered into a kind of lullaby for people who had slept little and cried too much.</span></p><p><span>“You were brave,” Rio murmured, not looking away from the window. “He would have been proud of you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s answer was a breath that trembled and then settled. “He hated when I cried,” she said, a ghost of a smile finding her mouth. “Said it made my eyeliner betray me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio huffed the smallest laugh. “Then we’ll tell him we kept it together for the makeup department.”</span></p><p><span>Outside, the city moved the way cities always do, indifferent and alive, horns and crosswalk chimes and a woman in a red coat carrying sunflowers. Inside the SUV, grief rode quietly, not like an enemy anymore but like a companion everyone knew by name. The house waited ahead, with its patched fences and its new cameras and its people who had chosen each other. The work of justice would resume. The hunt would resume. But for the long ride home, they let the silence hold them, and in it, the name they had promised to keep saying threaded through each breath.</span></p><p><span>Billy.</span></p>

<p><span>The motorcade moved like a river of black glass, two SUVs nose to tail along the post-funeral traffic. Inside the lead car, Agatha rested against Rio’s shoulder, the world outside a gray smear of trees and storefronts. Natasha drove, jaw set, eyes flicking between mirrors. Clint rode shotgun, unusually quiet, one hand hovering near the center console where his sidearm was hidden.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s gaze never stayed still. Every third car behind them. Every pedestrian who paused. The way a motorcycle held their blind spot just a beat too long. Her ribs felt tight, not grief this time, but the old, prickling instinct she’d learned to obey without question.</span></p><p><span>She felt it before she saw it, the faintest ripple of wrong. She snapped her head left. A black SUV roared out from a side street, too fast, too close. Another surged up behind them, engine screaming.</span></p><p><span>“Hold on!” Rio barked.</span></p><p><span>She moved before the words finished. She seized Agatha by the waist, yanked her across the bench, rolled with her, and slammed her own body over the actress just as the world detonated.</span></p><p><span>Impact slammed into them from both sides, a brutal crunch of steel and glass. The left flank collapsed inward; Natasha’s airbag exploded, pinning her. Clint’s forehead cracked the dash, he slumped, blood streaking his temple. The rear hit whipped them sideways; tires screamed; the SUV fishtailed, clipped a lamppost, and shuddered to a smoking halt across two lanes.</span></p><p><span>The second SUV—Alice, Yelena, Bucky, took a hard T-bone at the intersection behind them. It spun, skidded backward into a parked van, and wedged at a jagged angle. For a heartbeat, there was only ringing silence and drifting dust.</span></p><p><span>Then doors slammed. Boots hit asphalt. Figures poured out of the ramming vehicles like a black tide, ten, twelve, more, faces masked, weapons up: pistols, short batons, knives. Last to emerge, unhurried, was Maera Rourke. She was all hard lines and calm breath, hair twisted into a knot that looked like it could cut glass.</span></p><p><span>Rio shoved off Agatha, ignoring the bolt of pain that ripped through her side. “Stay down,” she rasped. “Do not move.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s fingers caught her wrist. “Rio—”</span></p><p><span>“Eyes on me.” Rio’s stare pinned her. “Breathe. I come back to you.”</span></p><p><span>She kicked the crumpled door twice; on the third hit it buckled, then gave. She slid out into the open, boots crunching glass, gun already in her hand. The world narrowed to angles and threats.</span></p><p><span>“Vidal,” Maera called over the din, a cruel half-smile breaking her severe face. “Finally.”</span></p><p><span>“You picked the wrong wake to crash,” Rio said, voice like ice.</span></p><p><span>Maera rolled a shoulder, drew her pistol with lazy confidence. “Said every dead woman ever.”</span></p><p><span>The first merc rushed her, knife low, pistol high. Rio beat the gun with her forearm, shoved it off-line as the round cracked past her ear, then stepped into the knife hand and snapped the wrist so fast the blade popped free. She palmed the knife, buried it under the attacker’s ribs, and used his body as cover against the second shooter’s muzzle flash. Blood misted her cheek. She shoved the dying man into his partner, kicked the partner’s knee sideways until the joint popped, then shot him once in the sternum without looking.</span></p><p><span>Three more fanned to encircle. She moved, never in a straight line, half-circles, a slip to step inside a punch, the baton strike she wrenched off a belt mid-motion. A pistol barked; heat lanced across her upper arm. She turned into the pain and drove the stolen baton into the gunman’s throat. He folded, gagging.</span></p><p><span>Two came together, blade and club. Rio let the knife pass close, feeling it tug fabric at her ribs, then trapped the blade arm, rolled her shoulder, and slung the attacker over her hip onto the cracked yellow line. The club came down; she interposed the fallen man’s forearm; the club hit bone with a sick snap. She snatched the club on the rebound and hammered it into the wielder’s solar plexus, then his ear. He collapsed, twitching.</span></p><p><span>“Rio!” Agatha’s voice, high, frayed, yanked at the corner of Rio’s focus.</span></p><p><span>“Stay there, mi vida!” Rio shouted back, never taking her eyes off the threats.</span></p><p><span>More mercs advanced, cautious now. Civilians had frozen on the sidewalks, phones up, the gasp of a crowd like a held breath. Sirens far away, threading closer. Maera waited beyond the ring, patient, predatory.</span></p><p><span>“Where’s that other car?” Rio murmured into the mic clipped under her collarbone.</span></p><p><span>Static. Then Alice, strained: “Pinned—driver side jammed—Yelena’s leg is—working it—two hostiles—”</span></p><p><span>“Hold,” Rio snapped. “Keep your heads down.”</span></p><p><span>She reloaded by feel, eyes up. A woman sprinted left, firing wild to force her into cover. Rio didn’t give ground. She cut the angle instead, met the runner at the hood of the wrecked SUV, and slammed a forearm across her jaw, bouncing her skull off the metal until her eyes rolled. Another attacker reached for a grappling line on his harness; Rio fired once; the hook clattered from nerveless fingers; he dropped to his knees with a red mouth opening in his chest.</span></p><p><span>She caught motion in the reflection of the SUV’s mangled chrome, someone coming fast behind her with a garrote. She ducked under the wire at the last instant, spun inside the loop, and rammed her fist into the man’s kidney twice, then once, hard, to the throat. He reeled, gurgling. She snatched the length of wire and, with one brutal twist, wove it between his forearms and the guard rail post, cinching it and jerking until he was stuck and useless.</span></p><p><span>Her breath burned. Her side screamed each time she pivoted. Blood slicked her fingers where a round had creased her triceps; warmth spread across her ribs where something was not right. She didn’t slow.</span></p><p><span>At the second SUV, the passenger door blew outward with a grunt. Yelena, grim, bleeding from the scalp, burst free by sheer rage, dragging a stunned merc by his collar. She threw him headfirst into the curb, stole his knife in one smooth pull, and carved another attacker across the thigh before he understood she was loose. Bucky kicked his door twice, then a third time; it gave with a shriek. He rolled out, came up firing a controlled two-shot pattern that put two mercs on their backs. Alice slid over the console and spilled onto the pavement, pistol already up, she took cover behind the axle and peppered a pair of boots that tried to flank.</span></p><p><span>“Visual on Maera,” Alice snapped into comms, breathless. “Ten total on lead push; five down; three circling left; two on rear.”</span></p><p><span>“Copy,” Rio said, wiping blood from her eyebrow with her sleeve. She grabbed a dropped baton, weighed it once, then changed her grip to the short end.</span></p><p><span>Three mercs broke to her left, trying to torch the SUV with a compact accelerant canister. Rio moved before they did, two steps, a feint right, then she slung the baton like a thrown hammer. It cracked the canister holder in the wrist; flame licked across his sleeve and he dropped it with a scream. She dove on the device, booted it under the ramming vehicle, and fired a single round to ignite it. A quick belly of orange whoofed under the chassis, forcing two would-be flankers to leap back, cursing.</span></p><p><span>Something dark flickered to her right. She turned too late. A baton whistled and clipped her ribs where they already ground. White pain flared; she tasted metal. She absorbed it, stepped into the next strike, caught the attacker’s wrist against her forearm, and let the momentum carry his arm high. Her knee pistoned up into his liver twice; he folded, gagging. She drove an elbow into the base of his skull to finish him. Another swung for her temple; she let gravity drop her under it, rolled, and came up with a broken mirror shard in her fist, raking it across the attacker’s Achilles tendon, dropping him screaming onto one knee. She hammered him out.</span></p><p><span>“Nat?” Rio called, breath sawing.</span></p><p><span>A groan from the driver’s seat. “Pinned,” Natasha ground out, voice paper-thin. “Left ankle… door’s kissing it. Clint—” A cough. “Alive. Concussed.”</span></p><p><span>“Copy. Keep your head down.”</span></p><p><span>The crowd murmured, pulled backward by instinct and fascination. Rio clocked their phones, their line of sight, the angles. She moved between Agatha and glass and guns without thinking, always reclaiming centerline. Agatha’s eyes, wide and bright with terror, tracked her like a lifeline.</span></p><p><span>Maera eased forward, letting her mercs spend themselves. She cocked her head, studying Rio’s feet, the set of her shoulders, the way her off-hand flexed and reset around the pistol grip.</span></p><p><span>“You move like a Ranger,” Maera called, conversational over the chaos. “I’ve killed a few of those.”</span></p><p><span>“You won’t kill this one,” Rio said.</span></p><p><span>Maera smiled without warmth. “You already failed one lover. The odds aren’t with you.”</span></p><p><span>Rage pricked the edges of Rio’s vision, sharp and clarifying. She did not answer. She did not rise to it. She just breathed and moved.</span></p><p><span>Two more came fast from opposite directions. She stepped to split them, ate a punch to give one back twice as hard. The second went low for a tackle; she sprawled, hooked his chin with her forearm and torqued, dumping him. She snatched his sidearm mid-fall and fired two rounds into the attacker behind him, then stitched one into the left-side runner’s thigh to stop his movement. A third merc lunged from the periphery; she pivoted and fired, but the slide locked back on empty. The merc grinned and raised his gun.</span></p><p><span>The shot never came. Bucky’s round took him in the ear. He spun, dropped boneless. “Move, Vidal!” Bucky shouted, already turning to engage the two trying to flank Yelena.</span></p><p><span>“On you!” Yelena yelled to Bucky, charging through the narrow aisle of space the crowd left, a wicked grin carved across her blood-slick face. She vaulted the hood of an abandoned coupe, tackled a merc into a sandwich board, snapped a zip-tie around his wrists with the kind of feral efficiency that said she’d done this a thousand times.</span></p><p><span>Alice, crouched, fired a short, angry burst that cracked a windshield and made two more take cover behind a mailbox. “Two left on my side, one trying for angle on Agatha!”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t look. She felt it, the shift, the aim. She ripped the rear door of the wrecked SUV open, yanked the fallen driver’s long baton free from the floorboard, and whirled it once. The merc peeking around the mailbox lined his sights on Agatha’s door window. Rio snapped her wrist and hurled the baton like a spear. It spun end-over-end and smashed the gun out of his hands; his finger reflex-fired; the shot went wild into the air.</span></p><p><span>Silence opened at the edges, the kind that happens before the final storm. Only Maera stood between Rio and the broken semicircle of men and women groaning on the pavement. Sirens had grown close now, a red-blue flicker washing the storefronts. Civilians filmed, spellbound.</span></p><p><span>Maera’s pistol came up, steady as a sermon. She fired twice.</span></p><p><span>The first round caught Rio high and back of the shoulder, spinning her, ripping hot pain through muscle. The second punched through her side, nasty and low. Air left her lungs in a rough bark. She staggered, a knee touching down as the world went white around the edges.</span></p><p><span>Agatha screamed, a raw, animal sound, clawing at the jammed seatbelt. “Río!”</span></p><p><span>Bucky broke left, trying to cut the angle, but a remaining merc lunged for his ankles. He booted the man in the face and kept moving, but the second’s delay cost him three steps he needed.</span></p><p><span>Maera didn’t advance. She closed the distance with words, not feet. “You’re bleeding out,” she said, voice almost kind. “How many ghosts are staring at you now? That pretty Valkyrie. Your team. Billy. Think they’ll make room for an actress?”</span></p><p><span>Rio planted a boot, forced herself upright. Every nerve burned. Blood soaked into her waistband, sticky and hot. She tuned the pain down the way she’d been taught, made it a radio she could turn to a murmur. She kept her gun hand steady by locking her other hand around her wrist, arms stiff, stance narrow to protect the hole in her side.</span></p><p><span>“Say her name again,” she hissed, “and I’ll make sure you don’t die clean.”</span></p><p><span>Maera smirked. “I don’t plan on dying at all.”</span></p><p><span>She came in fast, like a coiled spring unleashed, two shots in quick succession, both aimed center mass where she’d seen blood spreading. Rio didn’t step back; she stepped sideways hard, felt the first round tear through her chest and the second graze the meat of her ribs, but she ignored it, and snapped her muzzle up toward Maera’s face.</span></p><p><span>Maera swatted the barrel aside, grabbed Rio’s wrist, and jammed her thumb into the wound at Rio’s side. White-hot agony detonated. Rio’s vision blew to static. Maera used the opening to slam her forearm across Rio’s throat and drive her backwards into the SUV’s bent frame. Metal bit into Rio’s spine. The pistol skittered from her hand.</span></p><p><span>Agatha was half out of the car now, fingers on the ruined door, eyes wild. “Stop! Please!”</span></p><p><span>“Stay back!” Bucky roared, catching her around the waist and hauling her off the seat before she toppled onto broken glass. He wrapped her in both arms, pinning her, as she thrashed. “You can’t—Agatha, you can’t!”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hands found Maera’s jaw and ear, hunting for pain points. Maera kept her base low, hips heavy, forearm crushing. Black sparkles ate at the edges of Rio’s view. She palmed Maera’s eye, shoved; Maera snarled and bit her palm, a harsh, brutal chomp that broke skin. Rio drove a knee up and sideways, catching Maera’s kidney. It bought an inch. She took it, twisted under the forearm, got her shoulder low, and used the wrecked door frame to lever herself free.</span></p><p><span>They separated, two steps, three, both breathing hard. Maera’s brow was split; blood crawled into one eye. Rio’s side wept freely now; every inhale tasted like iron.</span></p><p><span>“Fun,” Maera panted. She smiled, feral. “Let’s finish.”</span></p><p><span>She holstered the pistol. That surprised Rio. Then Maera drew a fighting knife from the small of her back, broad, ugly, single-edged, and spun it once in her hand.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t have a blade. She glanced down: glass, a bent license plate, a length of snapped steel wiper arm. She snatched the wiper arm, weighed it, awkward, but it had reach, and settled into a low guard.</span></p><p><span>Maera stepped in, testing, slash high to make Rio block, feint low to see if she’d bite. Rio didn’t. She batted the first cut aside, felt the knife kiss the air an inch from her cheek, then jabbed the tip of the wiper at Maera’s throat. Maera parried it with the knife’s spine, rolled her wrist, and nicked Rio’s forearm hard enough to sting.</span></p><p><span>Another trade, Rio lunged to the outside of Maera’s knife hand, trying to control the elbow; Maera rotated out, cutting a line across Rio’s hip. Rio bit the pain in half and answered with a crack across Maera’s temple with the wiper arm. Maera reeled, then came back twice as fast, a furious flurry, slash, slash, thrust. Rio gave ground, boot soles slipping on glass, parrying with both hands until the wiper arm bent in the middle with a sad squeal.</span></p><p><span>Maera grinned. “You’re breaking.”</span></p><p><span>“So are you,” Rio said, and head-butted her.</span></p><p><span>Bone met bone. The shock traveled down Rio’s neck and lit up the place where the bullet sat, but Maera’s nose exploded, a red gush. She stumbled. Rio tried to capitalize, swinging the wiper in a low arc at Maera’s knee. Maera jumped the sweep, planted, and drove the knife up under Rio’s ribs, but Rio twisted at the last instant so the blade shaved along ribs instead of puncturing deep. It still set her world on fire.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s voice came through the static, torn and wrecked. “Río, please—please—”</span></p><p><span>“Watch me,” Rio whispered under her breath. She let the wiper arm drop, feinted as if the pain had stolen her balance, and let Maera come in greedy for the finish.</span></p><p><span>Maera took the bait. She stepped deep on Rio’s lead foot, knife angling for the notch above the hip. At the last instant, Rio pivoted on her heel, caught Maera’s knife wrist with both hands, and slammed it into the SUV’s bent door seam. Maera cursed and tried to rip free.</span></p><p><span>Rio let go of the wrist and went for the gun. Her pistol lay a few feet away, just past a glittering fan of safety glass. She dove, ribs screaming, and grabbed it left-handed because the right shook too much. Maera tore the knife free with a shriek of twisted steel and spun, raising the blade.</span></p><p><span>They moved at the same time, Maera driving in, knife flashing; Rio rolling to her back, bracing her elbows, bringing the muzzle up one-handed.</span></p><p><span>Two shots cracked almost as one, but only one found its mark where it mattered.</span></p><p><span>The round took Maera high between the eyes. Her expression froze mid-snarl. She dropped like a marionette with cut strings, knife thudding into the street a foot from Rio’s ear.</span></p><p><span>Everything went quiet then. Not truly, the sirens were on top of them now, people were screaming, someone was sobbing, but inside the circle of Rio’s breath, there was a hollow calm.</span></p><p><span>Her gun fell from her fingers. She tried to sit up, and the world tilted. She got as far as a lean on one elbow before the street rose to meet her. She rolled to her side to keep from choking on the iron in her mouth and pressed her palm to her wound. Warmth pulsed between her fingers.</span></p><p><span>“Rio!” Agatha was half out of the wreck, only Bucky’s iron arms keeping her from collapsing face-first onto the asphalt. She fought him, wild. “Let me go! Let me go!”</span></p><p><span>“Stay behind me,” he snarled, dragging her away from a fallen pistol someone’s shoe nudged toward them in the chaos. He wrapped her in a bear hug and physically carried her to the curb, setting her down only when she was shielded by the engine block.</span></p><p><span>Natasha stirred, a raw groan leaking past clenched teeth. She reached for the dash, found the door handle with searching fingers, and tried to lever herself free; her foot was tangled under warped metal. “Clint?” she rasped.</span></p><p><span>He answered with a low, pained grunt and a flutter of eyelashes.</span></p><p><span>Yelena limped into view, a gash across her hairline painting half her face red, eyes bright and murderous. “Who’s next?” she demanded of nobody, knife still in hand. Alice flanked her, gun tight, scanning every rooftop.</span></p><p><span>“Clear!” Bucky shouted, pivoting, gun out. “Clear left!”</span></p><p><span>“Right clear!” Yelena snapped, voice hard. “Downed hostiles only!”</span></p><p><span>Rio heard them with half an ear. Her world had narrowed to the square of sky between two buildings and the sound of Agatha sobbing her name into Bucky’s shoulder. The rest was drowned out, sirens, shouts, boots scuffing pavement. Even her own heartbeat, usually so steady, was broken glass in her ears, jagged and fading.</span></p><p><span>She wanted to lift her head, tell Agatha she was fine, but her body refused. Four gunshots burned like firebrands, her shoulder useless, her rib shattered, her lung drowning her in every breath. Three knives still seemed lodged in phantom places: her abdomen, her side, her hip. She couldn’t feel her left hand anymore. Her ribs grated like broken wood.</span></p><p><span>And then nothing.</span></p><p><span>Her chest stilled.</span></p><p><span>“She’s not breathing!” a paramedic shouted, already vaulting over the curb.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tore herself from Bucky’s arms, throwing herself onto the pavement beside Rio. Her hands fluttered uselessly, bloody fingers trying to press against wounds she couldn’t close. “No, no, no, please—” Her voice cracked on every syllable.</span></p><p><span>“Get her back!” another medic barked. CPR started immediately. The sound was sickening—bones that hadn’t broken yet cracking under the force of compressions.</span></p><p><span>“One, two, three—”</span></p><p><span>Agatha clawed at the medic’s arm. “You’re hurting her!”</span></p><p><span>“She’s gone if we stop!” the medic snapped.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s head lolled to one side, lips bluish, blood seeping steadily from her chest wound.</span></p><p><span>“Charge paddles!”</span></p><p><span>“No time, we keep compressions!”</span></p><p><span>Bucky grabbed Agatha’s shoulders, dragging her back against him as she tried to lunge forward again. She fought him like a wildcat, kicking, screaming. “She’s all I have! Don’t you stop! Don’t you dare stop!”</span></p><p><span>Yelena was on her knees, hands pressed into Rio’s abdomen, covered to the elbows in her blood, snarling through gritted teeth. “She doesn’t get to die! Do you hear me, Vidal? Not after all this shit!”</span></p><p><span>Alice’s voice was shaking as she counted out compressions for the medic, trying to keep her brain on rhythm instead of the horror. “Twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine—”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s body jolted under the weight of their efforts.</span></p><p><span>The medic sealed an oxygen mask to her face, squeezing the bag, but the chest remained stubbornly still.</span></p><p><span>“Flatline,” came the grim call.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s scream was ragged, inhuman.</span></p><p><span>“Again!” another medic shouted. Compressions redoubled.</span></p><p><span>One second. Two.</span></p><p><span>And then a cough. Wet, rattling, but a cough.</span></p><p><span>Her chest hitched, shallow but there.</span></p><p><span>“She’s back, we have a pulse! Move, move!”</span></p><p><span>They loaded her onto a gurney with brutal efficiency. IVs in both arms. Pressure bandages stacked thick over her wounds. One medic straddled the gurney, continuing compressions as they wheeled her toward the ambulance.</span></p><p><span>Agatha ran alongside, tripping, half-carried by Alice and Bucky. “I’m coming with her, you hear me?!”</span></p><p><span>“You can’t!” a medic snapped. “She’s critical, we need space to work!”</span></p><p><span>“You’ll have to shoot me to stop me!” Agatha screamed back, eyes wild, streaked with mascara and blood.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s chest fluttered once, then stopped again.</span></p><p><span>“She’s flatlining! Clear!”</span></p><p><span>They slammed paddles onto her chest, the shock snapping her body upward. No rhythm. Another jolt. No rhythm.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sobbed into Bucky’s arms, shaking uncontrollably. “She promised me she wouldn’t leave me!”</span></p><p><span>On the third shock, a weak blip appeared on the monitor. The medic exhaled hard. “We’ve got her, barely. Load her up!”</span></p><p><span>The ambulance doors slammed shut, red lights flaring.</span></p><p><span>At the hospital, chaos reigned. Nurses shouted vitals, doctors barked orders, carts rattled. Rio’s body was barely recognizable under the tubes, wires, and blood-soaked bandages.</span></p><p><span>“She’s crashing again—push epi!”</span></p><p><span>“BP’s bottoming out—”</span></p><p><span>“Lung collapsed—needle, now!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha clung to the glass outside the trauma bay, pounding with her fists. “She’s </span><em><span>mine!</span></em><span> Don’t let her die!”</span></p><p><span>Yelena tried to pull her back, but Agatha spun, feral. “You don’t understand, I didn’t get to tell her—” Her voice broke. “Not enough. Not like I should’ve.”</span></p><p><span>Inside, Rio’s body arched with another shock, monitor squealing. Flatline again.</span></p><p><span>Agatha dropped to her knees, screaming into her hands.</span></p><p><span>And still the team worked, refusing to give her up.</span></p>

<p><span>The hospital waiting room was too bright, too sterile. Its beige walls and buzzing lights pressed down on everyone like a weight. Agatha sat in the corner, hunched forward in one of the stiff vinyl chairs, elbows on her knees, her hands trembling. Wanda was at her side, a steady anchor, but her face was pale and drawn tight. Lilia had both hands wrapped around a paper cup of untouched coffee, staring into it like it might give her answers. Jen paced in a straight line, muttering under her breath, her phone clutched in her hand.</span></p><p><span>And then there was the team.</span></p><p><span>Natasha stood with her arms crossed, her jaw clenched so tightly it looked like stone. Yelena had worn a hole into the tile with how many times she’d circled the room, muttering in Russian curses too sharp to translate. Bucky leaned against the far wall, one hand curled into a fist, the other pinching the bridge of his nose like he was barely holding himself together. Clint sat slouched but coiled, eyes darting to every doorway like a hawk ready to launch. Alice had her laptop open, but her eyes weren’t on the screen; they were blank, unseeing, her mind clearly elsewhere.</span></p><p><span>They were wolves caged in glass, every muscle taut, every breath edged in fury and helplessness.</span></p><p><span>Hours stretched and folded in on themselves. The clock ticked too loudly. Every time someone in scrubs walked by, Agatha’s head jerked up, hope flashing, only to collapse again when it wasn’t </span><em><span>their</span></em><span> doctor.</span></p><p><span>Finally, Maria Hill arrived. Her heels clicked across the tile, her face grave. She moved with the kind of composure Agatha had come to associate with Rio: professional, impenetrable, controlled. But Agatha caught the flicker in Maria’s eyes when they scanned the room, the grief, the fury, the fear, and knew she was holding herself together by sheer will.</span></p><p><span>Maria pulled her phone from her pocket and exhaled sharply. “The world already knows.”</span></p><p><span>“What?” Jen snapped.</span></p><p><span>Maria turned the screen to show them. Videos. Dozens of them. Clips from cell phones: civilians screaming as two SUVs were slammed off the road, as armed men dragged themselves out, as gunfire cracked down a city street. A shaky zoomed-in video of Rio fighting alone, blood soaking her shirt, blades flashing in her hands. The final duel with Maera, Rio’s staggering but unrelenting fight until the final headshot.</span></p><p><span>The footage was everywhere.</span></p><p><span>Agatha slapped a hand over her mouth, the sound of Rio’s ragged breaths on screen tearing her apart.</span></p><p><span>“They’re calling it the ‘Battle of Sunset Strip,’” Maria said grimly. “The footage is being played on every network. Headlines are speculating. We can’t stay quiet, not after this. If we don’t say something, the world will write its own story.”</span></p><p><span>“What do we tell them?” Clint asked, his voice low, dark.</span></p><p><span>Maria’s eyes swept the group, lingering longer on her wife for a few extra seconds, but finally settled on Agatha, softening just slightly. “We tell them the truth. That Rio survived the ambush. That she’s in critical condition. That she’s fighting.”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Agatha rasped, shaking her head furiously. Her voice cracked, raw. “You can’t—don’t tell them how bad it is. If she—if she doesn’t—” Her words choked into silence.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Maria said gently but firmly. “The footage already shows the world how bad it is. We don’t control that. But what we can control is the message. We give the world something to rally around, something to hold onto. And Rio deserves for them to know how hard she fought.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha squeezed her hands into fists until her nails bit skin. Tears burned, but she nodded, because what else could she do?</span></p><p><span>Maria typed, her words measured, steady. Out loud, she read:</span></p><p><em><span>“S.H.I.E.L.D. can confirm that our co-founder, Rio Vidal, was critically injured during an ambush on Sunset Strip. Despite being outnumbered more than ten to one, she neutralized Maera Rourke, the Seventh Veil key enforcer, and more than two dozen mercenaries. She suffered multiple life-threatening injuries in the process and is currently in critical condition. She is receiving the best care possible, and we ask for privacy and respect as she continues to fight. Rio Vidal has always been relentless in her protection of others. We believe in her, and we stand with her.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>-Co CEO and Founder of S.H.I.E.L.D. Maria Romanov-Hill</span></em></p><p><span>She hit send before anyone could argue.</span></p><p><span>Silence swallowed the room.</span></p><p><span>Agatha pressed her face into her hands, muffling the sob that broke out of her chest. Wanda leaned against her, her own eyes wet. Lilia slid the untouched coffee aside and reached across the table, her hand shaking as she covered Agatha’s.</span></p><p><span>Then Jen’s phone buzzed. And Alice’s laptop pinged.

None of it mattered. Only Rio mattered. Only the fact that she was behind those doors, maybe slipping away with every tick of the clock.</span></p><p><span>More hours passed. Nurses came and went. Food was delivered but untouched. Every sound from the trauma bay made Agatha’s heart seize.</span></p><p><span>Finally, the doors opened. A doctor in pale blue scrubs stepped out, peeling off his gloves. He looked exhausted, his cap soaked with sweat.</span></p><p><span>Everyone in the waiting room shot to their feet.</span></p><p><span>“Ms. Vidal?” the doctor asked.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stumbled forward, Wanda catching her elbow. “Yes—she—”</span></p><p><span>The doctor softened. “She’s alive.”</span></p><p><span>The words cracked through the tension like lightning. Agatha sagged, nearly collapsing, but Wanda and Lilia caught her.</span></p><p><span>“She is alive,” the doctor repeated firmly, making sure it sank in. “We had to perform extensive surgery. Four gunshot wounds, three stab wounds, multiple fractures, collapsed lung, severe internal bleeding. It was touch-and-go. She flatlined several times, but we brought her back each time.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha clutched the doctor’s sleeve. “Can I see her?”</span></p><p><span>“You can, but…” His face sobered. “She’s in a medically induced coma. Her body needs time to recover. We’ll monitor her closely. The next seventy-two hours will be critical. But for now, she’s stable.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s tears spilled hot and fast. Relief, grief, terror, all at once. Wanda wrapped her in a fierce hug, Lilia’s hand pressed against her back, Jen dabbing her own eyes.</span></p><p><span>Behind them, the team exhaled in unison, the weight of hours lifted but not gone. Natasha hugged Maria tightly, Yelena swiped furiously at her eyes, Clint sat down heavily as if his knees had given out, and Bucky muttered something low that might’ve been a prayer.</span></p><p><span>Agatha could only whisper, over and over: “She’s alive. She’s alive. She’s alive.”</span></p><p><span>The words tasted like salvation and fear all at once.</span></p><p><span>The room was all hush and hum, soft machines, measured beeps, the gentle rasp of the ventilator pushing air into lungs that had fought too hard for too long. Rio lay so still beneath the thin hospital blanket that for a moment Agatha forgot how to breathe herself. She swallowed, eased closer, and wrapped her fingers around Rio’s hand, warm, heavy, flecked with old scars and fresh tape. There were bruises flowering beneath the IV, gauze peeking from under the sleeve of the hospital gown, a faint smear of antiseptic scent threaded through the sterile air.</span></p><p><span>“Hi, darling,” Agatha whispered, because anything louder felt like it might shatter the fragile bubble keeping Rio tethered here. “It’s me.”</span></p><p><span>The monitors continued their steady negotiations with fate. Agatha’s thumb traced the back of Rio’s knuckles, over a small ridge of bone that never healed perfectly, over the tendons that always flexed when Rio laughed. She brought those fingers to her lips and kissed them, tears already stinging.</span></p><p><span>“You’re stubborn,” she said, trying to smile. “So don’t you dare decide now is the moment to try something new.”</span></p><p><span>The door sighed open. Natasha stepped in first, shoulders squared, face composed, eyes red-rimmed but dry. Maria was beside her, hand brushing Natasha’s back in a touch so light it could have been breath. Lilia followed, her movements careful, like she was afraid of waking the pain. Behind them came Yelena, Bucky, Clint, and Alice, each quieter than Agatha had ever seen.</span></p><p><span>No one spoke for a long moment. They just gathered around the bed, their bodies a wall in a world that had already thrown everything at them.</span></p><p><span>Natasha finally stepped forward, stopping at the foot of the bed. “She looks better than I expected,” she said softly.</span></p><p><span>“She looks very angry to still be here,” Yelena muttered, swallowing hard. “Good. Anger keeps you alive.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky moved to the opposite side of the bed, eyes fixed on Rio’s face like he was counting every freckle. “You did it, kid,” he said, voice gravelly. “You kept her breathing. Now it’s your turn.”</span></p><p><span>Clint scrubbed a hand over his jaw and exhaled. “I owe you fifty bucks for that last shot. You still land cleaner headshots than me, and I’m offended.”</span></p><p><span>Alice stood at the end of the bed, hands tucked into her hoodie pocket. “I wish I’d been there in time,” she said. “I’m sorry, Rio. I’ll make it up to you. I’ll find the rest.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha squeezed Rio’s hand gently. “You hear that?” she whispered to her. “Your family’s here.”</span></p><p><span>Maria came closer and set two fingers on Rio’s forearm, like a grounding wire. “You’re allowed to sleep,” she murmured. “But you’re not allowed to leave.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha’s mouth wobbled and steadied. “We’ll take your shift,” she said to the quiet machines. “You rest.”</span></p><p><span>They each spoke in their way. A sentence. A small story. A promise. Clint promised to fix the squeaky door in the house that's been bothering her. Bucky promised to bully the physical therapist on Rio’s behalf when the time came. Yelena promised to “kill everyone twice” if they even breathed in Agatha’s direction. Maria didn’t promise. She simply said, “I’ve got you,” like she had a thousand times since the first day they’d met.</span></p><p><span>When the room had absorbed their words, Agatha drew a breath and stood. “Thank you,” she said, voice steadying by force. “Now I need you to do something for me.”</span></p><p><span>Every head turned.</span></p><p><span>“Go home.” Agatha lifted a hand when they started to protest. “All of you. Go home. Call your people. Crawl into bed with them. Eat real food. Shower. Sleep. You’ve been here since yesterday, and there’s nothing more you can do tonight that you haven’t already done.” She glanced at Maria and Natasha. “Except you two. You’re staying. And Lilia.”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Yelena said instantly, shaking her head. “I’m not—”</span></p><p><span>Agatha reached across Rio’s torso and caught Yelena’s hand. “Please. For me. You’ll come back in the morning and change places with Natasha and Maria. We are not falling apart one by one because none of us slept. That’s not what Rio would want.”</span></p><p><span>It was the appeal that landed. Even in her silence, Rio’s command still lived here.</span></p><p><span>Bucky nodded first. “I’ll take Yelena and Clint,” he said, not looking thrilled about it. “Alice, you coming?”</span></p><p><span>Alice’s jaw worked. She looked like the word </span><em><span>no</span></em><span> was latched to her teeth. Then she saw the pleading in Agatha’s face. “I’ll go,” she whispered. “But I’m setting alerts. If anything changes, we’re back in fifteen.”</span></p><p><span>“Ten,” Yelena countered.</span></p><p><span>“Seven,” Clint said dryly, because he couldn’t help himself.</span></p><p><span>They each touched Rio before they left, an old ritual, a new prayer. A squeeze to her shoulder. The lightest brush of knuckles against her hairline. Yelena bent and kissed her temple, quick and fierce, then glanced away as if embarrassed by tenderness. Bucky pressed his fist gently to Rio’s arm like a soldier acknowledging another soldier. Clint muttered, “You scary, terrifying woman. Don’t you dare make me cry again.” Alice tucked the blanket more neatly along Rio’s side, the way she always straightened her gear before a mission.</span></p><p><span>When the door closed behind them, the room exhaled. Quieter still. The beeps seemed softer. The air warmer.</span></p><p><span>Maria moved a chair to the other side of the bed. Natasha didn’t sit. She hovered at the footboard, sentinel. Lilia took her place near the window, the amber city glow washing her face in melancholy light. She clasped her hands tightly in her lap like she might wring water from grief if she twisted hard enough.</span></p><p><span>Agatha rested her forehead on the back of Rio’s hand and just breathed. After a while, she spoke without lifting it. “When she fell,” she said, “I thought—” Her breath hitched. “I thought I was hearing the sound of my own heart tearing apart. And then she stopped breathing and I—”</span></p><p><span>Natasha came around the bed then, quiet as fog, and placed a hand between Agatha’s shoulders. “She’s here,” she said simply. “You did what you had to. And she did what she always does.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha finally looked up. “She always does too much,” she said, trying to be wry and failing. “She doesn’t know where the line is.”</span></p><p><span>“She knows,” Maria said. “She just runs through it.”</span></p><p><span>That landed in Agatha’s ribs like a bell. She kissed Rio’s fingers again.</span></p><p><span>Lilia shifted, scooting her chair closer to the foot of the bed. “I never thanked you properly,” she said, soft but clear, looking at Rio’s unconscious face. “For bringing my boy home the first time.” She swallowed, eyes glistening. “I wanted to hate you when those photos leaked. Not because of you, because of the memories. But I can’t. Colten loved you. He admired you. And I see now why.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha reached her free hand toward Lilia; Lilia took it. They held on to each other across the sheets and wires.</span></p><p><span>The clock ticked toward a late, unkind hour. Nurses came and went, their movements gentle. A doctor poked his head in, nodded at Maria, glanced at the readings, and left. The ventilator sighed. Rio’s chest rose and fell. Sometimes her fingers twitched beneath Agatha’s thumb, phantom echoes of a fight still happening somewhere inside her systems.</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned in and spoke softly, just for Rio. “Do you remember the first time you cooked for me? You rolled your eyes at my pizza order and then made me the best coffee I’ve ever had in my life. I thought: this is what safety tastes like.” Her voice trembled and steadied. “You told me once you were afraid you couldn’t bear it if someone you loved died and you couldn’t stop it. And I told you I didn’t need a hero, I needed you. I still do. I need you to come back and be annoying about my sleep schedule and tell me to drink water and hide the spray bottle from Jen.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha snorted softly. “She hid it in the glovebox last week.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s mouth quirked. “Of course she did.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes filled again. She focused on a single freckle on Rio’s cheek and spoke to it like it might reply. “I was going to tell you back at the cabin,” she whispered. “I love you. I said it before, but I need to say it again. I love you, Rio Vidal. Please don’t make me say it to a grave.”</span></p><p><span>Silence fell heavy and tender. The machine beeps kept time with the ache.</span></p><p><span>After a while, Natasha said, “Do you want us to step out? Give you a minute?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head and squeezed Rio’s hand. “No. Stay.” She glanced at the chairs. “But you should sit. I’m not moving.”</span></p><p><span>Maria sat. Natasha perched at last, only because Maria tugged her down beside her. Lilia drew her knees up and rested her chin there like a girl remembering a different life.</span></p><p><span>They talked quietly, the way people talk when someone sleeps a foot away. Not about tactics or bounties or the Snake. In this room, those names held no power.</span></p><p><span>They spoke about Rio. About the time, she fixed a jammed camera crane on set with two hairpins and a curse. About how she pretended not to like </span><em><span>Below Deck</span></em><span> but texted Agatha an analysis of the cast’s conflict arcs at three in the morning. About the tattoo on her ribs that almost no one had seen up close, the tiny linework of a raven in flight, inked on the day she met Maria and Natasha, because she said they felt like the first wings she grew back after the war took them.</span></p><p><span>Agatha held those stories like talismans, turning each one over in her heart, polishing them with memory until they gleamed.</span></p><p><span>A nurse slipped in to check the lines and levels. “She’s holding steady,” the nurse murmured, and Agatha could have kissed her shoes.</span></p><p><span>Maria stood then, stretched out the knot in her back, and crossed to Agatha. “You should eat,” she said. “Or at least drink something.”</span></p><p><span>“I can’t,” Agatha said simply.</span></p><p><span>“You can,” Maria corrected gently. “But not yet. When you can’t, we will.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded. The gratitude hurt. “Thank you for staying.”</span></p><p><span>“We’re exactly where we’re supposed to be,” Natasha said. She rested her palms on the end of the bed. “We’ll rotate. Yelena and Bucky will be back at dawn. Clint and Alice will take the midday. You won’t be alone here a single second.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked down at Rio’s face, calm in its strange, borrowed sleep. “I should have insisted on an armored motorcade,” she whispered, guilt’s old talons digging in. “I should have—”</span></p><p><span>“Stop,” Natasha said, simple and firm. “We make plans. The enemy makes plans. What met on that street was not your fault.”</span></p><p><span>“She’s right,” Maria said. “Rio chose. She always chooses. If she could speak right now, she’d tell you to stop stealing her agency with your guilt.”</span></p><p><span>That startled a laugh out of Agatha. “God, she would.”</span></p><p><span>“‘Stop being dramatic, Harkness,’” Natasha imitated, perfectly dry.</span></p><p><span>“‘Drink water, Harkness,’” Lilia added, rolling her eyes fondly, and even Agatha smiled properly then.</span></p><p><span>For a while, the room settled into a fragile peace. Lilia dozed in her chair, chin tucked to her chest. Natasha and Maria murmured to each other in that seamless shorthand of people who have done life and war and laundry together. Agatha kept her post, one hand around Rio’s, the other carding gently through her hair, tracing the curl behind her ear that never stayed put.</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned closer, nose almost brushing Rio’s cheek. “Do you know,” she whispered, “that the first time I watched you laugh, really laugh, I thought—oh, I’m in trouble. I’ll never get over that sound.” Her fingers trembled in Rio’s hair. “So you can’t go anywhere. I’m greedy. I want that sound for a long, long time.”</span></p><p><span>The ventilator sighed. The heart monitor tapped out its measured reply.</span></p><p><span>Agatha lowered her forehead to the back of Rio’s hand again and closed her eyes. “Sleep,” she said. “I’ve got you.”</span></p><p><span>Minutes stretched. Or hours. Time lost its meaning in the steady exchange of machine and breath, in the warm weight of Rio’s hand against her lips.</span></p><p><span>The door nudged open once more. A different doctor this time, older, careful-eyed. He checked the readings, glanced over the incisions that peeked just above the gown’s edge, and nodded with quiet satisfaction. “She’s stable,” he said, keeping his voice low. “No new bleeding. We’ll keep her under tonight to give her body a fighting chance to repair. If this holds, we’ll reassess in the morning.”</span></p><p><span>“Can she hear us?” Agatha asked, the question catching at her throat.</span></p><p><span>“Sometimes,” the doctor said. “Sometimes the body hears, even if the mind is far away.” He offered a small smile. “Keep talking.”</span></p><p><span>“Always,” Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>When he left, Maria checked the time. “It’s nearly three,” she murmured. “Try to close your eyes, Agatha. Natasha and I will keep watch.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head. “I’ll close them when she opens hers.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia stirred and blinked at the window. “The city’s going to wake up soon,” she whispered, like a warning and a promise. “It will have opinions again.”</span></p><p><span>“They can shout into the void,” Natasha said, unbothered. “We’ll be here.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha bowed her head and pressed a final kiss to Rio’s knuckles for the hundredth time since she’d walked into the room. “I love you,” she said, not caring who heard, not anymore. “Come back to me.”</span></p><p><span>Outside the window, the sky lightened from black to bruised blue. Inside, the machines kept their patient vigil. Maria and Natasha settled into their posts, two sentinels carved from steel and grief. Lilia watched the horizon and breathed. Agatha threaded her fingers through Rio’s and refused to let go.</span></p><p><span>For now, the world was held together by a handful of women in a too-bright room and the steady, stubborn beat of a heart that still, miraculously, ferociously refused to stop.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The third sunrise broke pale and patient across the hospital blinds when Rio’s fingers flexed beneath Agatha’s. It was the smallest thing, a feather twitch, but it sent electricity through Agatha’s whole body. She jerked upright, sleep-deprived eyes flying to Rio’s face.</span></p><p><span>“Sweetheart?” Her voice cracked. “Rio, can you hear me?”</span></p><p><span>For a beat, the room was only machines: the soft hush of oxygen through the nasal cannula (they’d weaned her off the ventilator during the night), the reliable metronome of the heart monitor. Then Rio’s eyelashes trembled. Her brow knit, like she was trying to read a map in the dark. Her lips parted on a breath that sounded like gravel dragged over glass.</span></p><p><span>Agatha squeezed gently, trying to anchor her. “You’re safe. You’re with me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes opened, slow, unfocused, green-gold searching for purchase. They landed on Agatha’s face, and her whole body seemed to loosen. She tried to smile; it came out lopsided and a little dazed.</span></p><p><span>“Hey,” Agatha whispered, laughing and crying in the same breath. “Hi. There you are.”</span></p><p><span>Rio tried to say something. What came out was a broken rasp. She swallowed, winced, tried again. “You… okay?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed wetly, wiped her cheeks with the heel of her hand, and leaned in to press the gentlest kiss to Rio’s forehead, careful of bruises and tape. “Am I okay? You got shot four times. You were stabbed three times.” Her voice wobbled. “I’m okay. You’re the one who—”</span></p><p><span>“Alive,” Rio croaked, a ghost of a grin. “Told you… stubborn.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha dropped her forehead to their joined hands and just breathed. Relief swamped her so hard it left her shaky. “I am never letting you live this down.”</span></p><p><span>The door swished open. A nurse stepped in, took one look at Agatha’s face, then at Rio’s open eyes, and broke into a grin. “Well, hello there, Miss Vidal,” she said softly. “Welcome back.”</span></p><p><span>The next ten minutes were a slow blur of gentle checks and questions. Can you wiggle your toes? Squeeze my fingers? On a scale of one to ten, how’s your pain? Rio answered with the gritty patience of someone used to being stitched back together and graded on resilience. When they asked if she knew where she was, she croaked, “Hospital. Los Angeles. Year’s… the same?” The nurse laughed. “Close enough.”</span></p><p><span>The nurse promised to alert the attending and slipped out. Agatha brushed damp curls off Rio’s temple and tried to memorize every millimeter of her face as if seeing it for the first time again. “You scared me,” she said, voice small in the sudden quiet. “You scared all of us.”</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked slowly. “I’m sorry.” She shifted, a stab of pain tugging the corner of her mouth. “The team…?” Her eyes flicked, fear, guilt, calculation, all the reflexes of a protector inventorying casualties.</span></p><p><span>Agatha knew what she was asking. Her throat thickened, but she forced the words out, steady for Rio’s sake. “Natasha’s got a sprained wrist and ankle, and a broken rib. Yelena’s walking around with a bruised rib and a handful of cuts. Clint’s concussed, split his head open, but the doctors say he’ll heal. Bucky and Alice escaped mostly unharmed, just a few scrapes from broken glass.”</span></p><p><span>She paused, her voice taking on a colder tone. “Maera’s dead.”</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked slowly, her lashes heavy against her cheeks. For a moment, silence hung in the sterile air, punctuated only by the steady beep of the heart monitor. Then, with effort, she rasped, “You?”</span></p><p><span>Her head twitched slightly, as though she was trying to turn toward Agatha, but the stitches pulled at her skin and drew a sharp wince.</span></p><p><span>Agatha immediately leaned closer, her hand already tightening around Rio’s. “I’m okay,” she whispered, voice thick with the tears she was holding back. “Just a few cuts from the glass, and a few bruises, nothing more. You—” her voice trembled now, unable to stay even, “you saved me. Yet again.”</span></p><p><span>Her eyes glistened, the sheen of unshed tears catching the low light of the hospital room. She lifted Rio’s hand, pressing it against her own cheek as though needing to prove she was still there, still whole.</span></p><p><span>Rio stared at the ceiling for a hard beat, something like relief sparking through her eyes.</span></p><p><span>A knock brushed the door. Maria leaned in first, hair pulled back, eyes exhausted and luminous. Natasha was half a step behind, composed as ever, but when she saw Rio awake, the composure cracked. She exhaled like she’d been holding her breath underwater for three days.</span></p><p><span>“You look terrible,” Natasha said, which was Widow-speak for </span><em><span>thank God</span></em><span>. “Don’t do that again.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s laugh rasped. “I’ll… pencil it in.”</span></p><p><span>Maria came to the bedside and took the free hand that wasn’t glued to Natasha’s. Her thumb stroked across Rio’s knuckles, slow and grounding. “Welcome back, kid,” she said, voice rough. “You did well.”</span></p><p><span>“Team?” Rio murmured.</span></p><p><span>“All here,” Maria said. “And waiting outside like caffeinated wolves.”</span></p><p><span>As if summoned, Yelena’s voice carried from the hallway. “If she’s awake and you do not allow me to bully her about physical therapy immediately, I will burn this hospital down.”</span></p><p><span>“Door stays intact,” the nurse warned from the threshold, amused. “Two at a time, though please,”</span></p><p><span>They piled in anyway, Bucky, Yelena, and Clint push each other to be the first ones through the door, Alice comes in clutching a bouquet of wildly incongruent gas-station flowers like they were contraband. Lilia followed, eyes already shining. Jen slipped in behind, trying (failing) to hide that she’d been crying mascara tracks. Wanda eased last, a quiet storm in a black coat, Vision and Tommy just outside the door. Wanda caught Agatha’s eye and nodded: </span><em><span>Later. I’m here.</span></em></p><p><span>For a moment, no one spoke. They stood around the bed, a mixture of love and exasperation and terror-turned-relief.</span></p><p><span>Yelena planted her hands on her hips. “You are very dramatic, yes?” she said to Rio. “There are easier ways to get attention than stopping your heart.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s mouth curved. “Says the woman who once faked a concussion to steal a dog.”</span></p><p><span>“That was strategic,” Yelena sniffed. “And for the dog.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky leaned in, blue eyes bright despite the grizzled deadpan. “You owe me a beer,” he said. “Also, if you ever try to die on my watch again, I’m duct taping you to the couch.”</span></p><p><span>Clint raised his good hand. “Seconded. Also, for the record, I maintain my headshot is cleaner than yours. The camera angle on that street was unflattering.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyebrows tried to climb; the tape kept them in place. “Clint.”</span></p><p><span>“Fine,” he sighed, and his mouth softened. “You saved our girl.” He nodded toward Agatha. “Thank you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio turned her head, only a few degrees, careful of everything that hurt, and met Agatha’s eyes. Whatever passed between them was quiet and sure and enormous. Agatha brushed a stray curl back, eyes glistening again.</span></p><p><span>Alice set the flowers on the rolling tray with reverence and stepped close.” I’ll brief you when you’re ready,” she murmured, ever the analyst, even with tears in her lashes. Then, softer: “Don’t ever scare me like that again, boss.”</span></p><p><span>“Wasn’t… in the plan,” Rio rasped.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah, well,” Alice said, voice wobbling. “Update your plan.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia edged closer, fingers twisting the stem of a paper coffee cup. “Hello, darling,” she said to Rio, voice warm and aching. “You don’t have to talk. I just needed to see you breathing.” She bent and pressed a kiss to Rio’s hair. “Thank you for coming back.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda stepped up to Agatha’s shoulder and squeezed it, then leaned down so Rio could see her. “You stupid, brave woman,” she said softly. “Thank you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio wet her lips. “I promised,” she said. “I keep promises.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s gaze softened but held an iron edge. “Good. Then promise me you will live a very long time to keep making them.”</span></p><p><span>“Deal.”</span></p><p><span>The doctor came and went, pleased with the metrics, warning everyone that exhaustion would hit like a freight train in minutes. He wasn’t wrong. Ten smiles and five jokes later, Rio’s eyes started to drift. Agatha laughed when Rio tried to scowl about it.</span></p><p><span>“Sleep,” Agatha said, brushing her knuckles along Rio’s cheek. “We’re not going anywhere.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s fingers tightened on hers. “Stay.”</span></p><p><span>“Always.”</span></p><p><span>Her eyes slid shut.</span></p><p><span>The room didn’t exhale, exactly. It settled, like a house in winter shifting closer around its people.</span></p><p><span>They kept the visit short on purpose. One by one, they kissed Rio’s hair or squeezed her hand, each leaving a little offering of levity on the tray: a packet of gummy bears (Yelena), a tiny knitted raven someone had delivered to the front desk (Bucky), a Polaroid of the team making faces with a “GET WELL, BOSS” scrawled by Clint. Wanda promised to check in and bring decent tea. Lilia promised soup. Jen promised to battle producers with the fury of a thousand volcanoes. Alice promised to hack the sun if necessary.</span></p><p><span>Maria and Natasha lingered. Maria touched Agatha’s shoulder. “We’ll run interference,” she murmured. “If you want the next hour alone…”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded, grateful. “Thank you.”</span></p><p><span>The door closed softly. The machines hummed. Rio slept, breathing a touch deeper than before. Agatha watched her, then glanced at the riot of offerings on the tray and exhaled a laugh that was half-sob.</span></p><p><span>She reached for her phone. For a long moment, she just held it, thumb hovering. She wasn’t sure what to say to the world. Then she thought of the hundreds of thousands of messages, gentle, furious, terrified, that had ballooned her inbox. She thought of the hateful speculation, too. But mostly she thought of the people who loved them, who needed to see what she was seeing: a stubborn chest rising and falling; a future unspooling again.</span></p><p><span>Agatha shifted onto the edge of the mattress, careful of wires, and angled the camera. She leaned in close to Rio’s sleeping face, pressed their joined hands into the frame, and snapped a soft, grainy selfie. There were tears in her lashes, a smear of hospital light on Rio’s cheek, and the faintest curve of a smile still clinging to Rio’s mouth like a promise.</span></p><p><span>She typed, then deleted, then typed again.</span></p><p><b>@Mother_Harkness: </b><em><span>She’s awake.

No rumor, no threat, no one will ever take what we have. Not from me. Not from her. Thank you, my love, for protecting me, for standing by me, and for teaching me that home is a person, not a place.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Always, always yours.</span></em></p><p><em><span>—Agatha</span></em></p><p><span>She hovered one heartbeat more. Then she hit </span><b>Post</b><span>.</span></p><p><span>The effect was immediate, her screen a fireworks show of hearts, comments, tears. Within a minute, she was trending again, but for once the wave felt warm, not ravenous.</span></p><p><span>Maria peeked back in with Natasha, saw the phone in Agatha’s hand, and arched a brow. Agatha blew out a breath and turned the screen around. Maria’s mouth softened into that rare, sun-warm smile Agatha had only seen her wear with Natasha and Rio.</span></p><p><span>“What did you do?” Natasha asked, amused and suspicious in equal measure.</span></p><p><span>“Committed to joy,” Agatha said. “And told the truth.”</span></p><p><span>“Bold,” Natasha murmured. “On brand.”</span></p><p><span>“Also,” Agatha added, a wicked spark back at last, “I promised the internet a group photo.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha groaned. “Of course you did.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha grinned and beckoned. “Come on, Red. We’ll be quiet.”</span></p><p><span>A minute later, the door reopened like a clown car. Yelena wedged in, hauling Bucky by the sleeve. Clint limped in with theatrical sighs. Alice practically teleported. Jen dragged a white coat over her pajamas to look “respectable for posterity.” Lilia straightened her blouse and dabbed at her eyes. Wanda slipped in with Vision and Tommy hovering just outside the threshold, solemn and protective.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” Agatha whispered, lifting her phone. “Squeeze.”</span></p><p><span>“This is absurd,” Natasha said, already leaning in.</span></p><p><span>“Shut up and look intimidating,” Yelena ordered, then ruined it by beaming.</span></p><p><span>Agatha framed the shot so that Rio’s sleeping face was centered, everyone else a crescent of tenderness around her. Agatha leaned down and pressed their entwined hands to her heart, then clicked. The picture captured everything: bruises and laughter and mascara smudges and a dozen different kinds of love all aimed in the same direction.</span></p><p><span>She posted it as a carousel; the second slide was the quiet selfie from moments ago.</span></p><p><b>@Mother_Harkness</b><b><br/></b> <em><span>Family, by blood and by battle. Thank you for loving us.</span></em><span> 💜</span></p><p><span>And then she put the phone face down and took Rio’s hand again. “Sleep,” she whispered. “I’ll handle the internet.”</span></p><p><span>The internet, for once, behaved like a cathedral.</span></p><p><b>@Agathario_Updates</b><span>: Agatha Harkness CONFIRMS relationship with Bodyguard Rio Vidal with intimate photo from Hospital bed, after months of speculation.

She didn’t try. She looked at Rio instead.</span></p><p><span>As if hearing her name called in a distant room, Rio stirred. Her lashes fluttered. She opened her eyes, unfocused, found Agatha’s face again, and smiled the tiniest bit more.</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned close. “You just broke the internet,” she murmured.</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked, confused and amused. “Again?”</span></p><p><span>“Again,” Agatha said, and kissed the back of her hand. “Get some rest, </span><em><span>darling</span></em><span>. We’ve got a lot of living to do.”</span></p><p><span>From the doorway, Maria caught Natasha’s hand. Yelena tucked the blanket with a tenderness she’d deny. Bucky let out a breath like he’d been holding it his whole life. Wanda wiped at her eyes and smiled at Agatha over the bedrail.</span></p><p><span>The machines kept time. The room was warm. And for the first time in days, the future felt possible, threaded through with pain, yes, but bright with the ordinary, defiant miracle of waking up and choosing each other all over again.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The room was quiet in the way hospitals are quiet, soft machines humming, a murmur of footsteps in the hall, the slow, stubborn beep of the heart monitor pacing out proof of life. Rio lay propped up on pillows, bandages peeking from beneath the loose neck of the gown, the blue-tinged tape along her clavicle stark against her tan skin. An IV dripped steadily. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and stale coffee. It's been a week since the ambush, and the Doctors still refuse to send Rio home. </span></p><p><span>Agatha sat in the hard-backed chair at Rio’s bedside with her knees pulled up, one hand wrapped around Rio’s fingers like a lifeline. She’d been that way for an hour. Longer, maybe. Time ran funny in rooms like this.</span></p><p><span>“You should try to sleep,” Rio murmured, voice rough with healing and disuse.</span></p><p><span>Agatha huffed a laugh that didn’t reach her eyes. “You first.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s mouth tilted. “I would, but there’s a very persistent actress stonewalling my attempts.”</span></p><p><span>“That actress has a few notes, actually,” Agatha said, but her smile faltered as she studied Rio’s face—the purpled bruises, the split lip, the tiredness behind the dark eyes she loved. The words arrived without warning, thick and unwieldy. “I keep replaying it,” she said softly. “The sound of the metal. The way you threw yourself over me. Watching you—” She swallowed; it hurt. “I can’t stop thinking that every person who touches me ends up hurt. Or worse.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s fingers tightened as much as the tape and swelling would allow. “Hey.” She waited until Agatha looked up. “You don’t get to carry that. Not on my watch.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head, tears threatening. “How many times is this going to happen, Rio? How many bullets? How many scars? I love you, and I feel like loving me is a hazard sign.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s my job,” Rio said simply. “And even if it weren’t—” She made a careful breath, the edges of pain sharpening her inhale; she didn’t let it show beyond a blink. “Even if I’d met you as a stranger in a grocery store, I’d put myself between you and whatever came through the door. It’s who I am. It’s what I choose.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at her, jaw tight, trying to hold the line. “And if you can’t choose it anymore?”</span></p><p><span>“Then I’ll choose you in a different way.” Rio’s voice softened, the husk in it more tenderness than strain. “I don’t regret a single scar, Agatha. Not one. Not the old ones, not the new ones.” Her eyes warmed; the tears there surprised even her. “You are the love of my life. I have never meant those words more. I would do it all again, a thousand times, and I would not lose a minute of sleep over the choice.”</span></p><p><span>The dam went. Agatha bowed her head and pressed their joined hands to her lips. “I hate that you were alone on that street,” she whispered. “I hate that I watched, and I couldn’t—”</span></p><p><span>“You were not alone,” Rio said. “You were with me. We were with each other. That’s the only part I care about.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha scooted closer, careful of the IV line, and lay her cheek against Rio’s forearm. Her voice, when it came, had steadied. “Say it again.”</span></p><p><span>“That you’re the love of my life?” Rio’s mouth curved. “Gladly. You are the love of my life, Agatha Harkness. You are my home.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled like she’d been underwater. “Okay,” she said, a small, tear-wet laugh. “Okay.”</span></p><p><span>A soft knock preceded the doctor and a nurse. Agatha sat back, wiping under her eyes, and threaded her fingers with Rio’s again like a dare to anyone to separate them.</span></p><p><span>“Ms. Vidal,” the doctor said gently, checking the monitors. “How’s the pain?”</span></p><p><span>“Manageable,” Rio lied on instinct.</span></p><p><span>The nurse snorted. “That’s Ranger for ‘eight out of ten.’”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes smiled. “Seven.”</span></p><p><span>The doctor’s expression held that complicated mix of relief and restraint Agatha had grown to loathe, good news with barbs. “You’ve stabilized well. The lung puncture was the most concerning, but your oxygenation is improving. The shoulder wound was clean; we’re watching for nerve irritation. The abdominal trauma from the crash and the internal bleeding are… well, you know the list.”</span></p><p><span>“Greatest hits,” Rio said.</span></p><p><span>“Here’s what I need you both to hear,” the doctor continued, eyes shifting kindly to Agatha as if anticipating the storm there. “Recovery won’t be weeks. It will be months. You’ll need extensive physical therapy; respiratory work for the lungs, range-of-motion in the shoulder, rebuilding core strength, and endurance. You’ll be exhausted by how slow it feels. You’ll think you should be further along. That’s normal.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded. “Understood.”</span></p><p><span>The doctor paused. “I can’t promise you’ll be able to return to active, on-your-feet, high-threat security work at the same level. I can say we’re hopeful you’ll regain full function with time and adherence to rehab. But your body has been through a war.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s grip tightened; Rio squeezed back.</span></p><p><span>“Best case,” the doctor said, gentler now, “you come back strong. Different, maybe, but strong. Worst case, we pivot to a new normal that doesn’t ask your body to keep stepping in front of bullets.”</span></p><p><span>The words hung between the three of them, heavy and impossible.</span></p><p><span>“We’ll be scheduling consults with the PT team today,” the nurse added. “If you’ve got a place you can heal that’s quiet, low stress, with support, that’s ideal.”</span></p><p><span>Rio looked at Agatha. She didn’t need to say it. Agatha was already nodding. “We have a place,” she told the doctor. “We’ll make it work.”</span></p><p><span>When they left, the room felt smaller, the doorway too far. Agatha stood and leaned over, kissing Rio’s knuckles. “We’re going to your cabin,” she said. “No press, no paps, no gunshots, no beeping machines except maybe a coffee maker.”</span></p><p><span>Rio let out a breath that sounded dangerously like relief. “You okay with that? It’s… far.”</span></p><p><span>“Good,” Agatha said. “Let it be far. Wanda and Vision need far. Tommy needs far.” She swallowed around the ache. “We all need somewhere the world can’t find us for a minute.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded. “Wanda will say no.”</span></p><p><span>“She will,” Agatha agreed. “And then she’ll look at Tommy, and she’ll say yes.”</span></p><p><span>They let the quiet return, not empty this time, but planning-quiet. The kind where a future could be drawn, faint pencil lines waiting for ink.</span></p><p><span>“We’ll need to split the team,” Rio said after a moment, her voice turning practical even as it rasped. “Maria, Jen, and Lilia in L.A. to manage fallout. Sonya and Steve on the house, plus two of the Widows rotating with them. Alice can run Intel Remote from the SHIELD office and send us encrypted updates. Bucky and Natasha can come east, rotate with Yelena and Clint. Minimal footprint at the cabin, no convoys, nothing that draws eyes.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded. “I am already done filming. What little we have left to shoot, I can just tell the studio to wait, that I need time to grieve and rest, they won't argue.” A shadow crossed her face, then steadied. </span></p><p><span>“What about Hela and Evanora?” Rio asked, because she had to.</span></p><p><span>“We let them scream into the void,” Agatha said, surprising both of them.</span></p><p><span>Rio stared at her for a long moment, pride unfurling in her chest like a flag. “You’re brave.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m tired,” Agatha corrected. “If I can’t be safe, I can at least be stubborn.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed, then winced, then laughed again because the wince made Agatha fuss and she liked being fussed over by her. “We leave when the doctors clear me for transport,” she said. “We take a jet. No flight plans under our names. Thor’s contact can arrange it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes softened at “we.” “We,” she echoed.</span></p><p><span>A nurse popped in to adjust the drip and left them a minute later. Agatha sank back into the chair and traced a circle on the inside of Rio’s wrist where her pulse beat strong and steady. “You’re coming home,” she said. “And I don’t mean L.A.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s lashes lowered. “I know.”</span></p><p><span>They talked through the small things next, the ones that make a life. Who would pack what? Which blankets from the cabin did Agatha want ready? Whether the old record player worked or if they were finally going to replace it. What movies they’d bring for Tommy that didn’t feature explosions or loss? It felt defiant to plan these things. Holy, even.</span></p><p><span>After a while, Rio’s eyes grew heavy. Agatha saw it, stood, and bent to kiss her forehead. “Sleep,” she whispered. “I’ll be here when you wake up.”</span></p><p><span>“You always are,” Rio murmured, drifting.</span></p><p><span>Agatha settled back into the chair, fingers threaded with hers, and stared out at the thin slice of city visible through the blinds. Somewhere out there, the Seven, what remained of them, were hungry, circling. Somewhere out there, headlines were sharpening their teeth. Somewhere, grief lay like fog over a home that had once been loud with laughter.</span></p><p><span>But here, in this narrow, humming room, was a different truth. A stubborn, ordinary miracle. Breath in, breath out. A heartbeat steadying. A promise made and remade.</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned forward and pressed their joined hands to her chest. “We’ll go to the woods,” she whispered, for both of them. “We’ll heal. We’ll come back when we choose, not because they force us to.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s fingers twitched in her sleep, as if answering. Agatha smiled, the first one that didn’t fracture at the edges in days, and let her head tip back against the wall. She could almost smell pine and lake water, feel the sun on the dock, hear Rio’s laugh as if it were already summer again.</span></p><p><span>They would go. They would rest. And when they returned, it would not be as wounded animals limping from a fight, but as women who had remembered what they were fighting for.</span></p>

<p><span>It took another week at the hospital before the doctors agreed to release Rio, as long as she promised to keep up with physical therapy and admit herself back into the hospital if she feels any worse, or if she's not getting better by month three.</span></p><p><span>The cabin was quiet when they first arrived, the kind of silence that felt almost holy. Pines pressed close on all sides, their needles whispering in the late-spring breeze. The lake stretched out like a sheet of glass, reflecting clouds and gulls that swooped low. To Rio, it was a sanctuary. To the others, it quickly became the same.</span></p><p><span>The first storm rolled over the lake the day they arrived.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t dramatic, no lightning, no theatrics, just a quiet gray that settled over the pines and stitched the water to the sky. The cabin breathed it in like a living thing: timber creaked, the hearth sighed, and the big windows went soft with damp. It should have felt heavy, but to Agatha it felt like an exhale. To Rio, still pale beneath the stubborn set of her mouth, it felt like a test.</span></p><p><span>The first hour was logistics. Bags to bedrooms. The fridge stocked with the grocery delivery Alice had arranged from all the way in L.A. Wanda and Vision walked the guest house with Tommy, checking locks and lights, while Yelena and Natasha moved through the cabin with a soldier’s eye, counting exits, angles, sightlines, then added a gentler layer that only family can give: extra blankets at the foot of the beds, tea on the counter, a note on the whiteboard that read: “Breakfast duty: everyone (except the patient).”</span></p><p><span>The second hour was pain.</span></p><p><span>“Slow,” Agatha murmured, bracing one hand at the small of Rio’s back and the other around her forearm as they negotiated the two broad steps from the mudroom into the great room. “We don’t get points for speed.”</span></p><p><span>“We get points for not being carried,” Rio said, only half-joking, teeth clenched as the left side of her ribs complained. The brace under her soft black tee dug in when she breathed too deep. Beneath that: stitches, tape, vivid bruises blooming like hurricanes. She handled the cane like an insult rather than a tool, but she used it. She used it because Agatha had asked.</span></p><p><span>They made it to the long leather couch. Rio hated sitting; sitting felt like surrender. But the room was a cathedral of wood and glass, the lake an altar, and surrender suddenly didn’t feel like the worst thing, at least not when Agatha curled beside her, tucking a pillow under her healing shoulder and smoothing a palm over her sternum, as if coaxing her heartbeat to remember the right rhythm.</span></p><p><span>“Doctor’s orders for today are embarrassingly simple,” Agatha said, reading from a folded paper like it was scripture. “Rest. Hydrate. Eat. Three five-minute walks inside the house, spaced through the day. Breathing exercises every hour. And no heroics.”</span></p><p><span>“No heroics,” Rio echoed, drily. “That’ll be new.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s smile was quick and warm. “I know a hero when I see one. Doesn’t mean I’m letting you act like one in the living room.”</span></p><p><span>For a while there was just breath and the slow patter of rain on the deck. Then the pain meds dipped, and the room tilted.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s chest hitched. She fought the cough; it fought back. One half-stifled bark of sound sent a red line of fire across her ribs and up into her shoulder. Agatha sat up at once, fingers gentle but firm along the brace, grounding her through the surge.</span></p><p><span>“Easy,” Agatha murmured. “Ride it, don’t fight it.”</span></p><p><span>“It fights first,” Rio gritted out. She didn’t like when her voice sounded thin. Didn’t like the way pain invited memory. Her hand closed briefly on the couch seam, tight, white-knuckled before she pried it open and let Agatha take it.</span></p><p><span>The cough eased. The thunder rolled somewhere very far away. When the worst was past, Agatha pressed a glass of water to her lips. Rio sipped, then frowned as a muscle jumped in her cheek, a reflex she couldn’t hide fast enough.</span></p><p><span>“Tell me,” Agatha said softly.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t look at her. “It’s stupid.”</span></p><p><span>“Try me.”</span></p><p><span>A slow inhale, measured. “Just memories trying to pull me under. Every time I close my eyes, I’m back in a different ambush, the one where it wasn’t me shielding someone else, but someone shielding me. Someone who’s no longer here. The sights, the smells, the sounds… they all blur together until I can’t separate then from now.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s thumb stroked along her knuckles. The pressure was steady, present-tense. “Then keep your eyes open,” she said, and tilted her head to kiss the corner of Rio’s mouth. “I’m here. I will always be here.”</span></p><p><span>Rio let out a breath she didn’t know she’d trapped. A small nod. “You’re infuriating.”</span></p><p><span>“Correct.” Agatha’s smile turned mischievous. “Want me to distract you with facts about my incredible beauty?”</span></p><p><span>“That does usually work,” Rio admitted, and earned a quick, delighted laugh.</span></p><p><span>By midafternoon, Wanda padded over with a tray of soup and tea, the Wanda special, which meant it was both healing and surprisingly delicious. She didn’t hover or fuss; she placed the tray on the coffee table and squeezed Rio’s shoulder with a sister’s competence. Vision followed with a laptop configured for Rio’s breathing app and a playlist Tommy had composed “For Healing,” he’d titled it, all gentle piano and ambient lake sounds recorded that morning.</span></p><p><span>“You’re all ridiculous,” Rio muttered. “And I mean that in the best possible way.”</span></p><p><span>“Get used to it,” Wanda said, a soft smile curving her mouth. “We’re not going anywhere.”</span></p><p><span>That evening brought the first walk.</span></p><p><span>“Five minutes,” Agatha reminded, tapping the timer on her phone. “And if you so much as think about rounding a corner too fast, I will handcuff you to a chair.”</span></p><p><span>“Promises,” Yelena called from the kitchen, where she and Natasha were arguing passionatly about the correct ratio of lemon to garlic in something that smelled like heaven.</span></p><p><span>Rio rose cautiously. Agatha stood with her. Bucky moved in from the porch door without a word, slotting to Rio’s left in an old formation that said I’ve got your weak side, don’t waste energy. The cane clicked once on the hardwood; Rio’s jaw flexed, but she set a pace a hair slower than her pride wanted, and they made the loop: great room, hallway, bunkroom, mudroom, back to the couch.</span></p><p><span>On the second lap, her balance wavered on the turn. The world went slightly to the right, like a drunk camera. Bucky’s hand was already there, just a brush at her elbow, not even pressure, a cue to trust the line of her own body.</span></p><p><span>“When did you get so annoyingly useful?” Rio asked.</span></p><p><span>“Since forever,” Bucky deadpanned. “But I appreciate you finally noticing.”</span></p><p><span>“How’s your stabbing, Grandma?” Yelena asked peeking her head in the room, followed by Natasha</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked. “My… stabbing?”</span></p><p><span>“The places you were stabbed,” Yelena clarified cheerfully. “Still stabby?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted. Even Rio let a laugh slip; it startled her with how good it felt in her chest.</span></p><p><span>“Less stabby,” she conceded. “More achy.”</span></p><p><span>“Progress,” Natasha said, already satisfied.</span></p><p><span>By the time dinner, roasted vegetables, lemon chicken, and fresh bread hit the table, Rio’s edges had smoothed. The meds had landed. The rain had lifted. The lake had turned to molten pewter in the dusk.</span></p><p><span>They ate together at the long table. Wanda slipped easy jokes under the conversation, humor with padding around it. Agatha kept the pace light when Rio’s eyes went distant. Bucky swapped war stories for wilderness ones, wolves tracked in winter, the incredible stubbornness of raccoons. Yelena gave a dramatic retelling of being beaten by Bucky in a sprint that afternoon, complete with conspiracy theories about his “illegal leg length.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky, from the doorway, flipped her off with a smug smirk.</span></p><p><span>This, Rio thought, as warmth spread through her ribcage, was also medicine.</span></p><p><span>Night was harder.</span></p><p><span>Agatha woke to a sound that wasn’t a sound. A change in the air pressure, the way a room feels when someone holds their breath. She rolled, reaching instinctively.</span></p><p><span>Rio was sitting, not quite upright, hands clenched over the sheet, eyes open but not here. Breath quick and shallow. The scars, old and new, were stark against the silver moonlight.</span></p><p><span>“Hey,” Agatha said at once, voice low and clear. She put a palm on Rio’s sternum, not pressing, just there. “It’s me. You’re at the lake. You’re safe.”</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked once, twice, unfocused; her heart was a drum under Agatha’s hand. A tremor passed through her shoulders, then another, smaller. She swallowed.</span></p><p><span>“I know,” she said finally, hoarse. “I know.”</span></p><p><span>“Want to tell me?” Agatha asked. “Or want me to tell you something stupid until it passes?”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s mouth twitched. “Stupid, please.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha considered. “I once did an entire movie wearing a corset so tight I couldn’t sneeze, and on day seventeen I actually passed out mid-line and fell into a prop grave.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s breath hitched, then curved, just barely, toward a laugh. “Impeccable timing.”</span></p><p><span>“Thank you.” Agatha softened. “Talk to me, mi amor.”</span></p><p><span>Rio closed her eyes. When she spoke, the words came out steady, even if her hands still shook. “The last time I was held together by tape and stitches… I was waking up to silence. Not the good kind. We were—” She paused, not to censor, but to choose. “We were ambushed. We took cover behind a burned-out Hilux. The world was loud and small and—” Her jaw worked. “She pushed me down. Valkyrie. She used her body as a wall. I lived because she died. And I keep thinking, what if I’m there again and I look left and—”</span></p><p><span>“And you’re alone,” Agatha finished softly, understanding blooming like bruises. She shifted up, palms framing Rio’s face. “You’re not.”</span></p><p><span>“I know,” Rio said. This time it sounded like a promise she wanted to believe. “I know.”</span></p><p><span>The door tapped once. Bucky’s silhouette filled the crack. He didn’t enter until Agatha nodded him in.</span></p><p><span>“You good?” he asked Rio, no preamble, because she hated preamble.</span></p><p><span>“Not yet,” she said. Honesty between soldiers was its own tenderness.</span></p><p><span>Bucky came to the foot of the bed, hands in the pockets of his sweatpants. “Remember that thing we used to do?” he asked. “Three true things.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes flicked to his. “I remember.”</span></p><p><span>“Alright.” He held up a finger. “One: You’re not in Syria. You’re in Massachusetts. The worst thing in this room is Yelena’s snoring three walls over.”</span></p><p><span>“Two,” Bucky continued. “You are not alone. Not on your left, not on your six. If your brain lies and says you are, I will personally set off the car alarm so you remember this is my extremely annoying presence.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s mouth curved. “Please don’t set off my car alarm.”</span></p><p><span>“We’ll see,” Bucky said, deadpan. “Three: Valkyrie’s choice wasn’t permission for you to die later. It was the opposite. You honor her by living. By healing. And by letting us carry the corners when you can’t.”</span></p><p><span>Something unclenched in Rio’s chest, small and real. “Copy,” she said, voice steadier. “Three true things.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky nodded once, satisfied. “I’ll be in the chair on the porch. Yell if you need a raccoon wrestled.”</span></p><p><span>He left as simply as he’d come. Agatha slid down beside Rio again, tangling their legs.</span></p><p><span>“Three true things,” she echoed against Rio’s shoulder. “One: You are the most stubborn person I have ever met. Two: I love you more than all the bad parts of your brain combined. Three: You can wake me up a thousand times like this, and I won’t mind once.”</span></p><p><span>Rio turned her head and kissed her hair. “Copy,” she murmured, and this time when she closed her eyes, the rain was just rain.</span></p><p><span>Recovery measured itself in tiny victories.</span></p><p><span>Day four, Rio made it to the end of the dock and back, Agatha hovering like a mother hen who’d gone to finishing school but never forgot her roots. Day six, she managed the porch steps without needing Bucky’s hand. Day eight, she laughed hard enough at one of Yelena’s outrageous breakfast monologues that she had to clutch her ribs and wheeze, “Worth it,” while everyone cheered like she’d run a marathon.</span></p><p><span>There were setbacks. A muscle spasm that seized her back so abruptly she bit her lip bloody before Agatha eased her through it. A morning where the mirror showed her a stranger, hollow-eyed, stitched, not the blade-edged protector she knew, and she had to sit on the closed toilet while Agatha massaged moisturizer into her hands and told her exactly twelve terrible jokes in a row until Rio was glaring and smiling at the same time.</span></p><p><span>There were anchors. Wanda’s quiet competence as she wrapped and rewrapped Rio’s shoulder dressing with a medic’s hands. Vision’s gentle reminders to inhale for four, exhale for six, until the breathing app felt less like homework and more like a slow dance. Natasha’s lopsided grin when she beat Yelena in another spar, and then brought Rio a victory cookie she claimed was scientifically proven to promote healing.</span></p><p><span>And there was Agatha, always Agatha, flirting shamelessly when Rio’s brow knotted; stern as a general when Rio tried to do too much; a riot of warmth in the bed, on the couch, in the kitchen, perched on the counter watching Rio practice the smallest movements of lifting a kettle, turning a doorknob, buttoning a shirt without tugging the stitches.</span></p><p><span>“This is humiliating,” Rio muttered one afternoon as she worked a soft resistance band with her right hand, counting aloud to keep her breaths even.</span></p><p><span>“This is heroic,” Agatha corrected, sprawled on the rug like a cat, her long legs kicked out, reading off the PT sheet with exaggerated gravitas. “The noble warrior conquers the Band of Elastic Doom.”</span></p><p><span>Rio snorted despite herself. “You’re impossible.”</span></p><p><span>“And you love me.”</span></p><p><span>“Always.”</span></p><p><span>“Always,” Agatha repeated, and leaned up to kiss the underside of Rio’s jaw in a way that made her forget the ache for a full thirty seconds.</span></p><p><span>On the tenth day, the sun returned in full. The lake turned bright and blue, the world edged in green. Natasha and Yelena rigged a line from the porch beam and challenged Tommy to a pull-up contest; within five minutes, they were all cheating and everyone accused everyone else of egregious form violations. Bucky taught Vision how to skip stones with eerie precision. Wanda made lemonade so tart it made even Rio’s mouth pucker, and then she laughed like a bell when Agatha pretended to swoon dramatically onto the grass.</span></p><p><span>And later, when the afternoon softened, Rio stood on the dock with her cane hooked over one wrist, breathing the lake air, shoulders squared, profile steady, and said, very quietly, “This time is different.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha slid her hand into hers, their fingers interlacing. “Because you’re not alone.”</span></p><p><span>Rio looked at her then, really looked, as if cataloging a new definition of safety. “Because I’m not alone,” she agreed. “Because I have you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha squeezed. “Always.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s gaze drifted to the water. A memory flickered, stars over the lake, a screen and a mattress, laughter caught in their throats, and for once the past didn’t drag her; it buoyed her. She took a deeper breath, winced, then smiled through it.</span></p><p><span>“Bucky?” she called over her shoulder.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah?”</span></p><p><span>“Three true things.”</span></p><p><span>He grinned. “One: You’re ahead of schedule. Two: You still owe me a rematch at darts. Three: You’re going to be okay.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded once, letting the words land. “Copy.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned in, brushed a kiss at her temple. “Add one more,” she whispered. “Four: You’re loved.”</span></p><p><span>Rio closed her eyes, the lake, the cabin, the people she trusted settling around her like armor she didn’t have to carry alone. When she opened them, the sky was brighter.</span></p><p><span>“Four,” she said. “Copy.”</span></p><p><span>By the second week, the house had shifted from solemn silence and pain to something closer to life. Bucky stood one morning on the porch with a mug of coffee, staring at the log beams and the joints fitted cleanly together. “You built all this?” he asked, tone halfway between impressed and disbelieving.</span></p><p><span>Rio, still wrapped in blankets, managed a small nod. “Every inch. Took me a year. Best therapy I ever had.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha arched an eyebrow from her seat beside him. “Most people buy a punching bag. You build a fortress.”</span></p><p><span>“Punching bag doesn’t keep the rain out.”</span></p><p><span>That earned a laugh from Yelena, sprawled across the porch swing, hair in a messy bun. “Honestly? Disgustingly impressive. If you weren’t already terrifying, you’d be intimidating just for being this handy.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha came out just then, balancing Rio’s pain meds on a tray with the smug air of someone about to win an argument. She leaned down to kiss Rio’s temple and quipped, “Oh, she’s disgusting, alright. Disgustingly attractive. Don’t get jealous just because your assassin resume doesn’t include ‘cabin architect.’”</span></p><p><span>“Impossible woman,” Rio groaned.</span></p><p><span>“Flatterer,” Agatha shot back, kissing her again before Yelena gagged loudly, flailing on the swing. Natasha smirked into her coffee, unbothered.</span></p><p><span>It was moments like these that reminded them all why they’d come here.</span></p><p><span>Wanda and Tommy wandered up the hill then, their footsteps soft, Tommy still moving like he wasn’t sure how to fill the empty space beside him. Wanda gave Rio a small smile. “The boys were saying how impressed they were with this place. You really did build it all?”</span></p><p><span>Rio hesitated, then nodded. “Yeah. For peace of mind.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda’s eyes softened. “I hope you get to keep it. You deserve peace.”</span></p><p><span>Rio had no sarcastic answer to that, only a quiet murmur: “So do you.”</span></p><p><span>One Day, Agatha was pacing in front of the porch, arms crossed. “I don’t care if I’ve got a coven on speed-dial and an ex-special forces girlfriend, I refuse to be the useless one in the room again.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha didn’t argue. She just tossed Agatha a pair of padded gloves. “Fine. Outside. Ten minutes.”</span></p><p><span>Yelena perked up like a cat hearing a can opener. “Oh, this is going to be good.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha showed up in a silk robe and slippers, which nearly made Natasha combust. “I’m not breaking a sweat in polyester.”</span></p><p><span>“Change.”</span></p><p><span>“But—”</span></p><p><span>“Change.”</span></p><p><span>Ten minutes later, Agatha shuffled back out in leggings and a fitted shirt that made Rio choke on her water. “Don’t break her,” Rio warned, though her eyes betrayed how little she actually minded watching.</span></p><p><span>“I’ll be gentle,” Natasha deadpanned.</span></p><p><span>She wasn’t.</span></p><p><span>Agatha cursed, tripped, and whined through push-ups and grappling drills, Yelena gleefully pinning her to the grass half a dozen times. But Agatha was stubborn. Every bruise only made her push harder. By the second month, she was holding her own. By the third, she was throwing Yelena hard enough that Bucky muttered, “Huh,” under his breath, which from him was equivalent to a standing ovation.</span></p><p><span>Rio watched every session, bundled in blankets on the porch, pride swelling in her chest. “That’s my girl,” she whispered once. Agatha caught the words on the breeze and fought twice as hard.</span></p><p><span>Meals became a ritual. Wanda and Vision cooked in the guesthouse but always brought dishes up to share, turning the cabin kitchen into a whirlwind of pots, laughter, and clashing accents. Tommy lingered more and more, until Agatha had him chopping vegetables and making sarcastic commentary like he’d been part of her chaos forever.</span></p><p><span>Evenings turned into card games and Below Deck marathons on Rio’s battered projector. Wanda and Natasha teamed up at poker, cleaning everyone out until Agatha flipped the table for “emotional damages.” Tommy laughed so hard he nearly fell off his chair, the first real laugh anyone had heard from him since Billy’s death.</span></p><p><span>The grief never disappeared. Some nights, Wanda slipped down to the water’s edge and sat there until dawn. Sometimes Agatha went with her, sometimes Tommy did, and sometimes Rio just watched from the porch, keeping vigil in silence.</span></p><p><span>Vision was the quiet anchor, always steady. And one night, Wanda murmured to Rio while Agatha slept curled at her side, “You can’t let her go before you. She wouldn’t survive it.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s throat tightened, but she nodded. “I won’t. Not if I can help it.”</span></p><p><span>It was the closest thing to a vow either woman had spoken aloud.</span></p><p><span>The team would gather in the living room every few days, phones on speaker, tension coiled sharp getting run downs from Alice and Maria back in L.A on Hela, and Evanora’s movements. And when the calls ended, they deliberately relaxed again. Yelena demanded s’mores. Natasha taught Tommy how to clean a knife. Agatha curled into Rio’s lap, daring anyone to comment.</span></p><p><span>Because life had to keep moving.</span></p><p><span>By the third month, Rio could walk on her own, though every step still carried pain. Agatha made tormenting her a daily mission.</span></p><p><span>“Did you know,” she whispered one afternoon, sidling up to Rio on the porch, “that medically, orgasms can speed healing?”</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned. “You’re insufferable.”</span></p><p><span>“And you love it.”</span></p><p><span>“Unfortunately, yes.”</span></p><p><span>Rio talked everyone into going hiking with her to celebrate the fact shes getting her strength back. No one could find it in themselves to say no.</span></p><p><span>The trail wrapped like a ribbon around the lake, pine needles crunching beneath boots and the air sharp with the scent of water and moss. For the first time in months, Rio was walking on her own, no cane, no hand bracing her side, just her steady stride matching the others.</span></p><p><span>Agatha hovered at her side anyway, one hand brushing Rio’s arm whenever she thought no one was looking. “Darling,” she drawled, “I must say, the way you limp slightly is very… rugged. You could be the poster child for a wilderness survival magazine.”</span></p><p><span>Rio rolled her eyes. “It’s called recovering from multiple bullet wounds, Agatha. Not sexy.”</span></p><p><span>“Everything you do is sexy,” Agatha countered with a grin. “Even when you sneeze.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha groaned audibly from up ahead. “How do you people live like this?”</span></p><p><span>“With joy,” Agatha quipped, swinging Rio’s hand in hers like a schoolgirl.</span></p><p><span>Bucky smirked. “I think she does it just to annoy us.”</span></p><p><span>“Correct!” Agatha beamed, leaning over to kiss Rio’s cheek. Rio flushed, muttering something about regretting ever leaving the cabin.</span></p><p><span>Behind them, Yelena stretched her arms dramatically. “I can’t listen to this. Tommy! Race me to that rock.” She pointed toward a boulder half a mile up the trail.</span></p><p><span>Tommy raised his brows. “You sure? You’re not as fast as you think.”</span></p><p><span>“Please. I could run circles around you.”</span></p><p><span>“Bet?” Tommy smirked, already loosening his shoulders.</span></p><p><span>“Bet.”</span></p><p><span>And then they were off, pounding down the dirt path, Yelena’s braid flying and Tommy’s sneakers kicking up dust. Everyone stopped to watch.</span></p><p><span>“Ten bucks on the kid,” Bucky muttered.</span></p><p><span>“Make it twenty,” Natasha added.</span></p><p><span>Agatha cupped her hands around her mouth. “Don’t trip, Lena! Wouldn’t want to embarrass yourself in front of the </span><em><span>children</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>“Shut up, witch!” Yelena yelled back without breaking stride.</span></p><p><span>They tore toward the boulder, neck and neck, until the final few yards when Tommy found a burst of speed and shot past her, leaping onto the rock with both arms raised like a victorious gladiator.</span></p><p><span>“I win!” he shouted, face split in a grin.</span></p><p><span>The group erupted in laughter. Wanda clapped proudly from the back. Vision offered Tommy a dignified nod like he’d just graduated from Harvard.</span></p><p><span>Yelena bent double, panting. “He—he cheated. He’s like half my weight.”</span></p><p><span>“You lost to a teenager,” Natasha said flatly. “Own it.”</span></p><p><span>“Tragic,” Bucky added, smirking.</span></p><p><span>Even Rio cracked a smile. “You’re never living this down.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha was practically doubled over with laughter, tears in her eyes. “Oh, Lena, sweetheart, I’ll tell this story at every dinner party for the rest of time.”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t you dare!” Yelena wailed.</span></p><p><span>But the mood had shifted, lighter, freer. For the first time since the ambush, since the funeral, since the hospital, they felt like themselves again. Like a family.</span></p><p><span>The trail bent closer to the water, the sunlight glittering off the lake. Agatha leaned her head against Rio’s shoulder as they walked, still holding her hand. “See? This is exactly what you needed, my love. Fresh air. Exercise. My unparalleled wit.”</span></p><p><span>“You talk too much,” Rio murmured, though her thumb brushed across Agatha’s knuckles, soft and reverent.</span></p><p><span>“And yet you love me for it.”</span></p><p><span>“Unfortunately, yes.”</span></p><p><span>“Stop calling your love for me unfortunate.” Agatha’s mock offense had everyone laughing again, including Rio herself, who gave in and kissed her quickly just to shut her up.</span></p><p><span>“Disgusting,” Natasha muttered.</span></p><p><span>“Adorable,” Wanda corrected softly, smiling at them both.</span></p><p><span>By the time they circled back to the cabin, the sun had begun dipping low, staining the sky gold. Tommy was still gloating, Yelena still sulking, and Agatha still teasing Rio mercilessly. But the laughter carried down the trail, mixing with the rustle of trees and the call of birds overhead.</span></p><p><span>For the first time in too long, they all felt whole again.</span></p><p><span>Agatha continued teasing her through training sessions, through meals, even mid-poker game, leaning close to murmur things that had Rio flushing scarlet while Natasha arched a brow. Yelena once caught them sneaking kisses by the lake and yelled, “Gross! Take it to the guesthouse!” only for Agatha to shout back, “That’s Wanda’s house, you menace!”</span></p><p><span>Tommy laughed so hard he dropped his marshmallow in the fire.</span></p><p><span>By the end of three months, Rio was no longer the pale, fragile figure who had died in Agatha’s arms. She was scarred, yes, but stronger. Her body had filled back out, her strength returning with every spar, every walk around the lake, every stubborn refusal to quit.</span></p><p><span>“You scared us,” Natasha admitted one evening as the sun sank behind the trees.</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded slowly. “I scared myself. But I had something worth fighting back to.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned in and kissed her then, soft and certain. Natasha politely looked away, but not before the faintest smile tugged her lips.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The last night at the cabin settled over the lake like velvet. The air was cool but not sharp, carrying the scent of woodsmoke from the bonfire Rio and Bucky had coaxed to life at the edge of the shore. Flames licked high, crackling against the quiet symphony of frogs singing and the gentle slap of water against the dock.</span></p><p><span>Wanda stood near the fire with Tommy and Vision, her fingers tightening around the thin wooden handle of the paper lantern she held. The lantern glowed softly, ready for flight, its fragile skin painted with a simple star, Tommy’s touch.</span></p><p><span>Agatha, hair braided loosely over one shoulder, walked to Wanda’s side. “He’d have hated the quiet,” she said softly, her voice carrying a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes.</span></p><p><span>Wanda gave a watery laugh. “He’d be teasing us already. Asking if we brought marshmallows.”</span></p><p><span>Together, the four of them, Wanda, Vision, Tommy, and Agatha, lifted the lantern, letting the flame inside heat the air until it began to rise. Their hands fell away at the same moment, and the lantern drifted upward, golden against the indigo night.</span></p><p><span>Everyone stood in silence as it climbed higher, its reflection shimmering across the lake’s surface. Rio’s arm slipped around Agatha’s waist, steady and grounding, while Natasha’s hand found Yelena’s shoulder. Even Bucky, quiet, watchful, bowed his head slightly.</span></p><p><span>The lantern drifted until it was just a star among stars, and only then did Wanda’s tears fall freely. Vision wrapped her into his chest, Tommy leaning into them both. Agatha reached for Rio’s hand, twining their fingers, her throat thick with the weight of memory.</span></p><p><span>“Goodbye, Billy,” Wanda whispered. “We love you.”</span></p><p><span>The silence that followed was full, not empty. Full of love, of grief, of the kind of family that clings harder after loss.</span></p><p><span>Later, laughter chased away the heaviness. They sat on logs pulled close to the fire, roasting marshmallows, trading stories that had nothing to do with battles or enemies. Natasha told the story of Yelena’s first attempt at driving. Yelena threw a marshmallow at her. Bucky claimed his cooking was superior to all of theirs, prompting Agatha to howl in protest and promise to duel him with a skillet.</span></p><p><span>Rio sat back, her arm slung over the back of Agatha’s chair, letting the fire warm the front of her while the cool night brushed her back. Agatha leaned into her, sipping wine, her laugh warm and free.</span></p><p><span>“This lake,” Agatha said suddenly, her tone shifting with nostalgia. “Do you know this is where Rio and I first became official?”</span></p><p><span>Rio froze. “Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, don’t look at me like that, darling. Everyone already knew we were circling each other like wolves. This place sealed it.”</span></p><p><span>The group smiled, amused. Wanda’s lips curved faintly. Natasha raised an eyebrow. Yelena elbowed Bucky.</span></p><p><span>“And,” Agatha added with a devilish grin, “this is also where we first had sex.”</span></p><p><span>The silence was immediate, followed by choking laughter from Yelena and a groan from Natasha. Bucky muttered something under his breath before abruptly standing.</span></p><p><span>“Oh no,” Agatha said, realizing too late.</span></p><p><span>Bucky moved fast, scooping her up in a fireman’s carry despite her squirming. “You don’t get to traumatize us like that without consequences.”</span></p><p><span>“Bucky, put me down this instant!” Agatha shrieked, kicking her legs. “Rio! Save me!”</span></p><p><span>Rio only leaned back on her log, smirking despite herself. “I’d say you deserve this, mi amor.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky marched to the end of the dock and, without ceremony, launched Agatha into the lake. She hit the water with a splash and surfaced moments later, sputtering and laughing, her makeup streaked and her coat floating around her like seaweed.</span></p><p><span>“You absolute menace!” she shouted, flipping her soaked hair back.</span></p><p><span>The group erupted in laughter. Yelena whooped, clapping her hands. Tommy doubled over. Even Wanda, still raw with grief, laughed genuinely for the first time in weeks.</span></p><p><span>But Agatha wasn’t done. She pushed herself back onto the dock, dripping wet, and lunged at Bucky, grabbing his arm and yanking him into the lake. He went in with a curse and a massive splash.</span></p><p><span>That was the spark.</span></p><p><span>Yelena tackled Natasha into the water next, both shrieking as they went under. Tommy cannonballed in after them, sending a wave that drenched Rio and Vision, still sitting by the fire.</span></p><p><span>Rio shook her head slowly, wiping her face. “Children. All of them.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re just scared,” Agatha taunted from the lake, treading water with a grin that was pure trouble.</span></p><p><span>“Scared?” Rio stood, peeling off her flannel and tossing it aside. “You’ll regret that.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s smirk faltered. “Darling, wait—”</span></p><p><span>But Rio dove in with perfect form, cutting into the water and surfacing right beside Agatha. In one smooth motion, she swept the actress into her arms and dunked her under. Agatha came up spluttering and laughing too hard to even fight back.</span></p><p><span>“Betrayal!” she cried dramatically, throwing her arms around Rio’s neck.</span></p><p><span>Rio just rolled her eyes, but her smile was wide, her laughter real.</span></p><p><span>Soon, Vision waded in, shaking his head but indulging Wanda, who had rolled up her dress and slipped into the shallows. Natasha and Yelena splashed each other viciously, while Tommy egged them on. Bucky was already plotting revenge on Agatha, who kept swimming just out of reach.</span></p><p><span>The lake became chaos, screams, splashes, laughter echoing across the water. The fire burned steady on the shore, lantern light reflecting in ripples across the surface.</span></p><p><span>Agatha clung to Rio at one point, pressing her forehead to hers. “The last time we were here,” she murmured, soft enough only Rio could hear, “You took me on the best date I have ever been on.”</span></p><p><span>Rio brushed a strand of wet hair from Agatha’s face. “Best decision I ever made.”</span></p><p><span>“And I fell even more in love with you right here,” Agatha whispered. “Still am, every second.”</span></p><p><span>Rio kissed her, quick and fierce, before another wave hit them, courtesy of Yelena’s cannonball. They broke apart laughing, gasping for air.</span></p><p><span>Eventually, soaked and breathless, they all dragged themselves back onto the shore, collapsing near the fire. Clothes clung, hair dripped, teeth chattered, but the smiles were wide, unbroken.</span></p><p><span>For a while, they just sat, watching the flames lick the night sky, listening to the water settle back into calm.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t perfect. There was still danger ahead, battles waiting for them beyond the lake. But tonight, here, they were whole. They were together.</span></p><p><span>And for the first time since everything began, they let themselves believe that maybe, just maybe, they’d make it through.</span></p><p><span>The fire had burned low by the time Agatha and Rio slipped away from the others, blankets pulled around their shoulders. Their clothes were still damp from the lake, hair clinging in curling tendrils, but neither cared. The porch overlooking the water was quiet, only the soft hiss of crickets and the gentle lap of waves against the shore filling the air.</span></p><p><span>Agatha nestled against Rio, her head tucked under her chin, legs drawn up under the blanket. The air carried the faint chill of midnight, but Rio’s arms kept her warm, steady and unyielding.</span></p><p><span>For a long time, they didn’t speak. They didn’t need to. The silence was full of the night, of their shared breath, of the peace neither of them had felt in months.</span></p><p><span>Agatha was the one to break it, her voice hushed, as though speaking too loudly might shatter the fragile stillness. “You know,” she murmured, “when we go back to L.A.… I don’t think I can live in that house anymore.”</span></p><p><span>Rio tilted her head slightly, pressing a kiss into Agatha’s hair. “Too many ghosts,” she said softly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s laugh was quiet, but it held no humor. “Every room feels tainted now. The living room where the leaks played on TV, the dining table where we planned defenses, the front gate they stormed through. Even Billy…” Her voice cracked, and she swallowed hard, curling closer. “I don’t want to keep walking through those doors, reliving it all over and over.”</span></p><p><span>Rio held her tighter, her hand rubbing slow circles down her back. “Then don’t,” she said simply. “We’ll find somewhere new. Somewhere that feels like home, not a war zone.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha hesitated, then pulled back just enough to see Rio’s face, her own eyes shimmering with nervousness. “There’s something else,” she admitted, biting her lip in a rare flash of vulnerability.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s brows lifted slightly, but her gaze stayed steady. “Go on.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hand found Rio’s, fingers fidgeting with the rough scars that crossed her knuckles. “We’ve lived together for half a year now. I’ve gotten used to you being there every night, every morning. Even when you’re bossy and terrifying and make me eat actual vegetables—”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked faintly. “You’re welcome.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her smile was soft. “My point is, I can’t imagine not having that. Not having you. So…” She drew in a breath, nerves bubbling in her chest, and finally asked, “When I get a new place, will you move in with me? Not as my bodyguard. As my partner. As… us.”</span></p><p><span>The words hung between them, fragile and enormous. For a moment, Agatha feared she’d ruined the peace, overstepped, asked too much. But then Rio’s expression softened, the guarded lines around her mouth easing, her eyes warming in a way that made Agatha’s heart stutter.</span></p><p><span>“My Love,” Rio said, her voice low and reverent. “I thought you’d never ask.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked, her nerves flipping into something like disbelief. “You mean, you actually want to?”</span></p><p><span>Rio cupped her face in both hands, her thumbs brushing along her cheeks. “I want nothing more. I can’t picture my life without you. Even when it’s been chaos and danger and loss… every morning I’ve woken up with you beside me has been worth it. I’ll follow you wherever you go. House, cabin, hell, even a shoebox apartment. Doesn’t matter. If you’re there, it’s home.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s throat tightened, her vision blurring. She tried to laugh, to deflect, but the emotion was too strong. “God, you really know how to make a girl cry.”</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned in, pressing their foreheads together. “I love you, Agatha. More than I ever thought I’d be able to love anyone again. So yes, when you find that new house, I’ll be right there. With you. Always.”</span></p><p><span>The tears slipped free then, but Agatha was smiling through them. She kissed Rio, slow and deep, pouring everything she felt into it, relief, devotion, gratitude, the wild, terrifying certainty of love.</span></p><p><span>When they finally pulled apart, Agatha laughed softly, brushing her thumb over Rio’s lips. “So it’s settled. We’ll find a new place. Together. And I’m decorating.”</span></p><p><span>Rio arched a brow. “We’ll see about that. I’ve seen your taste.”</span></p><p><span>“Please,” Agatha scoffed, her grin widening. “You’re lucky to have me. Otherwise, you’d still be living in this lumberjack fantasy cabin with nothing but wood and flannel.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked. “You love it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned back into her chest, closing her eyes as the sound of the lake wrapped around them. “I do,” she admitted. “But I love you more.”</span></p><p><span>The night stretched on around them, the fire embers glowing faintly in the distance, the lantern for Billy now just a memory among the stars. And on that porch, wrapped in each other, they let themselves believe in a future—one built not on fear, but on lov</span><span>e, laughter, and the promise of a shared home waiting just ahead.</span></p><p><span>As they walked back toward the cabin, fingers still intertwined, Agatha’s phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out lazily, expecting Jen or Wanda, but froze when she read the message on the screen: </span></p><p><span><em>Love makes you weak. I’ll prove it soon. – Snake.</em> </span></p><p><span>The air seemed colder suddenly, the shadows around the lake a little darker. Rio read over her shoulder, jaw tightening, but when Agatha’s eyes met hers, the fear there hardened into something fiercer, resolve. Whatever Evanora thought she could take from them, she was wrong. They weren’t weak. They were stronger than ever.</span></p>

<p><span>They hit L.A. just after dusk, the city smeared in neon and brake lights, the kind of glow that made every window look like an eye. The two SUVs rolled through the back gate and into Agatha’s drive; Sonya and Steve stepped out of the shadows like they’d grown there. Hugs were quick, hand squeezes were quicker. Everyone looked older than three months ago, not in years, but in grit.</span></p><p><span>Inside, the house felt both familiar and slightly wrong, like a favorite coat that didn’t fit quite the same after a long winter. Furniture had shifted; security cameras had multiplied. A framed photo of Billy that Wanda had quietly set on the mantle caught the lamplight. Agatha’s gaze hooked on it and stayed, just for a beat.</span></p><p><span>“Welcome back to the circus,” Alice said, already moving, already plugging in. She’d set up a war corner in the dining room: three laptops, a portable server, a whiteboard dense with timelines and codenames. Her hair was up, her eyes red from the plane and not-sleep. “I’ve got files for each of you, but let me give you the lay of the land before we drown in PDFs.”</span></p><p><span>Jen slipped in behind her with Lilia, both in black, both carrying the exhaustion of people who’d been keeping watch while others healed. Lilia crossed to Agatha first, cupped her cheek, kissed her forehead—maternal, fierce, finished with a whispered, “You look rested, thank God.” Then to Rio, a steady clasp of forearms that said what words didn’t need to.</span></p><p><span>They gathered around the table. Natasha and Yelena bracketed the back wall. Bucky took a chair and immediately turned it backward like he was interrogating it. Wanda perched on the arm of the couch, Vision beside her, their fingers laced.</span></p><p><span>Alice clicked a slide to life on the largest monitor. Headlines stacked like falling dominoes: </span></p><p><b>Entertainment Weekly: </b><span>Three Months of Silence: Agatha Harkness, Wanda Maximoff, and Rio Vidal Retreat from Spotlight After Tragedy</span><b><br/><br/></b></p><p><em><span>Following the heartbreaking death of Wanda’s son, Billy, and the near-fatal ambush that left bodyguard Rio Vidal in critical condition, the women disappeared from public view. Fans speculated endlessly, but the silence only deepened the mystery.</span></em></p><p><b>The Hollywood Reporter: </b><span>From Tragedy to Resilience: Inside Agatha Harkness and Wanda Maximoff’s Three-Month Disappearance</span></p><p><em><span>Exclusive sources reveal how Wanda, Agatha, and Rio Vidal quietly retreated to heal—away from cameras, red carpets, and headlines. With Billy’s loss and Rio’s recovery, the trio returned stronger, bonded, and unafraid to live their truth.</span></em></p><p><span>“Media first,” Jen said, voice crisp, practiced. “Your complete blackout worked. It bought us quiet and infuriated the press. Speculation ran rampant: secret shoot, witness protection, breakup, breakdown. We fed them nothing,” She flicked her phone. “But your fans? The Coven held the line. They kept amplifying Jessica’s piece. They treated the silence like a boundary, not an admission of guilt.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled. She’d suspected; hearing it still loosened something in her chest. “Good. They deserve medals.”</span></p><p><span>“Or a pizza party,” Yelena offered.</span></p><p><span>Alice pulled up a second timeline, this one cold, clinical. “While you were healing, Evanora and Hela didn’t vanish. They went low. Quiet accounts, burner phones. We tracked movement through the Seventh Veil’s shell companies. Funds shifted, smaller amounts, more often. They were paying retainers, not hiring armies. My read? They were rebuilding the bones, safe houses, gear, favors.”</span></p><p><span>“Any public moves?” Rio asked, shoulders squared, face unreadable but for the darting pulse at her jaw.</span></p><p><span>“Two,” Alice said. “A fire at a storage facility in Orange County, arson, targeted. It housed evidence impounded from Raven’s apartment. Most of it survived thanks to sprinklers, but not all. Also, an attempted breach at the L.A. County evidence locker, where all the evidence from what we've gathered so far on the Seventh Veil is, was thwarted by a very grumpy clerk and a lock that refused to die. That one has Hela’s fingerprints, literally. Partial, smudged, but hers.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha’s head tilted. “Sloppy.”</span></p><p><span>“Desperate,” Bucky countered.</span></p><p><span>Jen slid a folder to Agatha, another to Rio. “We were granted limited access to interview Raven and Kyra in custody.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s brows shot up. “And you didn’t lead with that?”</span></p><p><span>“We wanted you seated first,” Lilia said, tone wry, eyes soft.</span></p><p><span>Jen opened her folder. “Raven first. She’s… cooperative in the way of someone trying to plead their way into witness protection. She insists she wasn’t the mastermind, just a courier and a door-opener. She named Renna as ‘the firestarter’ and painted Hela as the blade. She also tried to apologize to you on camera, Agatha, about the role she's played in all this.” Jen’s mouth tugged. “We did not give her that satisfaction.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s jaw worked once, then eased. “Good.”</span></p><p><span>“Alice and I cross-checked,” Jen went on. “Some of Raven’s detail aligns, addresses, dates, a storage unit that did, in fact, contain the same make of light clamps used to sabotage the catwalk rig. But when we pressed her on Evanora, she clammed up. Still loyal to the brand.”</span></p><p><span>Alice took the handoff. “Kyra was… a different flavor. She switches between rage and worship. She loves you, Agatha, and she hates you for not loving her back. She mocked Rio’s team again,” Alice’s eyes flicked to Rio, apologetic, “and called Hela ‘the knife with a heartbeat.’ She also slipped up twice. First, she muttered that ‘the Crow sees everything,’ which confirms Raven was also their watcher. Second, she referenced ‘the Fox’s ashes,’ which suggests Renna’s death rattled the hive more than they let on.”</span></p><p><span>“Kyra also tried to bargain,” Alice added. “Wanted us to transfer her to county lockup in exchange for </span><em><span>helpful hints.</span></em><span> We declined.”</span></p><p><span>“Wise,” Natasha said.</span></p><p><span>“Seren?” Rio asked. “What’s she done besides stew behind bars?”</span></p><p><span>“She’s gotten her hands on a few phones behind bars, posted a few angry and cryptic tweets, prison guards have her in solitary confinement to stop contraband from getting to her, but my gut tells me she still has access somehow,” Alice said.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s pacing slowed. “Evanora? Any more direct communication?”</span></p><p><span>Lilia’s mouth flattened. “She sent an email to my office last month. No demands. Just a line: </span><em><span>I made you, and I can unmake you.</span></em><span> I forwarded it to Maria, who forwarded it to the DOJ. Officially, it’s evidence. Unofficially, it’s trash.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at the table, then lifted her chin. “She wants me back in the light. She wants the stage. We deny her that, she’ll create a stage.”</span></p><p><span>“Which brings us to now,” Alice said, pivoting to the final slide: a map of the city, pinpricks of red and blue. “Hela’s cards slowed. Evanora’s money moved. Seren continues to taunt us from behind bars. And today—” She zoomed on a red dot pulsing near the Fashion District. “—there’s a cluster of pings we’ve never seen before. Burners booted, killed, booted. It smells like staging.”</span></p><p><span>Jen exhaled through her nose. “And the media is hungry. They’ve gotten used to nothing; they’re ready to feast on anything. There’s already chatter that you’re back in town. We kept it quiet, but someone saw the SUVs at the gate.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha glanced at Rio. Rio’s look said what it always did: </span><em><span>We move only when we say so.</span></em></p><p><span>They broke for a few hours of sleep in the house that no longer slept, alarms layered over alarms. Morning crept in gray and wary.</span></p><p><span>The morning began with static.</span></p><p><span>Alice had been tracking chatter since dawn, eyes bloodshot, coffee cooling untouched beside her laptop. Rio was restless, too restless, pacing the length of Agatha’s living room with a stiffness that betrayed her still-mending ribs. Agatha watched her from the couch, trying not to smile at the stubbornness that made Rio walk even when every step cost her.</span></p><p><span>It was Jen who burst in first, phone clutched white-knuckled. “She’s out,” she said flatly.</span></p><p><span>The room froze. Wanda, perched on the arm of a chair, went pale. Natasha’s hand drifted unconsciously to the gun at her hip.</span></p><p><span>“Seren?” Rio asked, though she already knew. </span></p><p><span>“Prison transfer ambush. The whole convoy was killed. She’s gone.” Jen set the phone down on the table like it burned. “And she’s broadcasting.”</span></p><p><span>Alice spun the laptop around. The screen flickered with a grainy video feed: a sniper’s crosshairs locked on Rio. It was live. Somewhere.</span></p><p><span>The feed zoomed, sharpened, and showed her face in high definition.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt her stomach plummet.</span></p><p><span>The comments were already scrolling, hundreds of them.</span></p><p><span><br/></span> <em><span>“Who’s filming this?!”</span></em><em><span><br/></span></em> <em><span>“Where is Rio?!”</span></em><em><span><br/></span></em> <em><span>“This isn’t funny!”</span></em></p><p><span>Rio leaned forward, jaw clenched. “That’s not live,” she said after a beat, her voice hard with forced calm. “Lighting’s off. Sun’s wrong. They’re using stock.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha saw the muscle ticking in her cheek, the way her hand hovered near her sidearm, and knew. Rio was furious, but beneath it, afraid.</span></p><p><span>“They’re baiting you,” Alice confirmed. “Trying to make you reckless.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hand curled into a fist in her lap. Reckless wasn’t Rio’s problem. It was hers.</span></p><p><span>Agatha lay awake in the dark that night, Rio’s steady weight warm against her side. The soldier was asleep, or close to it, her breaths shallow and uneven, the sound of someone whose body fought rest even when it needed it most. Every shift made the mattress creak, every soft groan of pain sent guilt spearing through Agatha’s chest.</span></p><p><span>On the nightstand, her phone glowed faintly. One message replayed in her mind: Seren’s video, the rifle scope centered on Rio’s chest as she walked across their balcony with a mug of coffee. Alice had confirmed it wasn’t live. Old footage, spliced, doctored. A bluff. But Agatha couldn’t shake the sick truth behind it, if not today, then tomorrow. If not a bluff, then the next shot could be real.</span></p><p><span>Her hand hovered over Rio’s arm, torn between waking her and letting her sleep. In the end, she bent close, pressing her lips softly to Rio’s temple. “I love you,” she whispered, a confession in the dark. “That’s why I have to do this.”</span></p><p><span>She slid carefully from the bed, pausing when Rio shifted in her sleep, her hand clutching at empty sheets before settling again. Agatha’s throat burned as she forced herself to move. She dressed quickly, in dark clothes, soft shoes, and tucked her phone into her pocket.</span></p><p><span>One call. That’s all it took. Evanora answered on the second ring, her voice low and mocking, velvet hiding the blade.  “My wayward daughter. I wondered how long you’d last.”</span></p><p><span>“You leave them alone,” Agatha said, her voice sharp, even as her hands trembled. “Rio. The team. Wanda’s family. This ends with me.”</span></p><p><span>A pause, then a cruel little laugh. “You sound just like her. Always ready to bleed for people who won’t survive anyway.”</span></p><p><span>“Where?” Agatha snapped, refusing to give her mother the satisfaction of hesitation.</span></p><p><span>Evanora purred out the address, the abandoned soundstage where Agatha had filmed her first big role. “Come alone. Or I’ll send Hela to finish what she started.”</span></p><p><span>The line went dead.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stood for a moment in the quiet room, the hum of L.A. traffic seeping through the windows, Rio’s uneven breathing steady behind her. She turned back once, memorizing the sight: Rio curled on her side, one hand reaching unconsciously toward the space Agatha had left, even in sleep.</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed hard. “I’ll come back to you,” she whispered. “I swear it.”</span></p><p><span>Then she slipped out into the night.</span></p><p><span>A van waited at the curb, its headlights off, engine idling low. Two masked figures stood beside it, weapons visible even in the dark. Agatha didn’t resist as they bound her wrists. She didn’t fight when they shoved her into the back seat.</span></p><p><span>The last thing she saw through the tinted glass was the faint outline of their bedroom window, a rectangle of gold against the night. Somewhere behind it, Rio slept, safe for now.</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed her eyes. And let herself be carried into the dark.</span></p><p><span>Rio woke slowly, the way she always did now, pain first, then awareness. The dull throb of her healing ribs. The faint pull of scar tissue when she breathed too deeply. The warmth of the sheets. And, always, the instinctive reach for the body beside her.</span></p><p><span>Her hand met cool linen.</span></p><p><span>Her eyes snapped open.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha?”</span></p><p><span>The room was dim, dawn only just brushing the curtains with pale light. The lamp on the nightstand was still on, though, casting its weary glow over the empty side of the bed. The blanket was folded back, not thrown. Agatha had gotten up carefully. Deliberately.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s chest went tight. She forced herself up, ignoring the flare of pain. Her eyes swept the room the way they used to sweep kill zones. Agatha’s boots were gone. So was her coat.</span></p><p><span>On the dresser, Rio spotted it, an envelope propped against her watch. Her throat closed as she reached for it, her fingers already trembling.</span></p><p><span>Her name. Just her name, written in Agatha’s looping script.</span></p><p><span>She tore it open.</span></p><p><em><span>My love,</span></em><em><span><br/><br/></span></em></p><p><em><span>I know you’ll be furious. I know you’ll never forgive me for leaving you like this. But I can’t keep letting you bleed for me. You’ve already given me more than anyone ever has: your scars, your strength, your love. If I let you give me your life too, then Evanora wins, even if she never touches me.</span></em></p><p><em><span>They want me, not you. If I go, maybe I can end this without another body on the floor. Maybe I can protect the only thing that matters anymore—you. Don’t follow. Don’t come after me. Please. Live.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Yours, always,</span></em><em><span><br/></span></em> <em><span>Agatha.</span></em></p><p><span>The letter shook in Rio’s hands. She read it once, twice, then crushed it in her fist, rage flaring hot enough to make her wounds scream.</span></p><p><span>“Goddammit, Agatha.” Her voice cracked against the walls.</span></p><p><span>She stumbled to the window, yanking the curtain aside. The street outside was empty, save for the faint rumble of a distant engine disappearing into the early morning haze.</span></p><p><span>“She’s gone,” Rio muttered, half to herself, half to the ghosts that always followed her. Her heart hammered in her chest, uneven and panicked, the sound louder than the city itself.</span></p><p><span>Her comm sat on the nightstand. She grabbed it, thumb shaking as she keyed into the team channel. “Agatha’s gone. She left. She gave herself up.”</span></p><p><span>Voices erupted all at once: Natasha’s sharp curse, Yelena demanding coordinates, Bucky’s clipped </span><em><span>stay calm</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Rio pressed her palm hard against her forehead, willing herself to breathe. She wanted to punch the wall, to throw the lamp, to tear the city apart brick by brick until she found her. But the only thing that left her was a hoarse whisper:</span></p><p><span>“She thinks she’s protecting me. She thinks, she thinks this ends if she gives herself over.”</span></p><p><span>For the first time in years, Rio felt helpless. Not because she didn’t know what to do, she knew exactly what to do, but because the one person she would burn the world for had asked her not to.</span></p><p><span>Her chest heaved. She looked at the crumpled letter in her fist. “Too late, mi vida. You should’ve known I’d never let you do this alone.”</span></p><p><span>And with that, Rio shoved down the pain, shoved past the fear, and started pulling on her gear.</span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>The van smelled of cigarettes and old leather.</span></p><p><span>Evanora sat across from her, elegant even in cruelty. Her nails were sharp, painted a glossy venom green. “So easy,” she purred, tapping a nail against her wine-red lips. “My daughter walks into the wolf’s den all by herself.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned back, crossing her ankles like she was lounging instead of shackled. “Well, I figured if I didn’t, you’d just keep sending badly edited livestreams. Frankly, it was embarrassing.”</span></p><p><span>The slap came quick, sharp. Agatha’s cheek burned, but she kept her smile lazy. “Careful, Mother. You’ll smudge your polish.”</span></p><p><span>Evanora’s lips curved in something between a snarl and a smile.</span></p><p><span>Across from her, silent, was Hela. Hood up, eyes shadowed, but unmistakable. Agatha’s chest tightened at the sight, though she willed her face to stay neutral. First love. First betrayal. And now, one of her captors.</span></p><p><span>“You don’t even have the decency to look ashamed,” Evanora hissed.</span></p><p><span>“Of what? Not turning into you?” Agatha shot back. “If that’s shame, I’ll pass.”</span></p><p><span>Another slap. Harsher. Agatha let the sting settle, then raised her brows. “Keep this up and the fans are going to think this is a reboot of </span><em><span>Mommy Dearest.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>For a heartbeat, Hela’s mouth twitched. A crack in her mask. Then she looked away, jaw tight.</span></p><p><span>Evanora didn’t notice. She was too busy reveling in the small power of violence, the old patterns replayed.</span></p><p><span>They brought her to the abandoned soundstage.</span></p><p><span>It was ironic, really, poetic in a way Agatha could almost appreciate. This was where she’d first met Hela. A set dressed as a gothic manor, long rotted now, cobwebs in the corners, scaffolding rusting above. A hollow place built for pretending.</span></p><p><span>The soundstage smelled of dust and mildew, its rafters groaning in the night wind. Once, cameras had rolled here, lights blazing, extras laughing between takes. Now, the only lights came from rigs Seren had set up, cheap ring lamps, mounted phones, wires snaking across the cracked concrete. The glow painted Agatha like an actress trapped in a role she hadn’t agreed to.</span></p><p><span>Her wrists were bound, her knees driven into the floor. She held her head high anyway, hair tumbling wild, eyes burning into the shadows where she knew the cameras were.</span></p><p><span>Evanora made her entrance like she owned the stage. Cloaked in black, her presence heavy, magnetic, every gesture precise as if she’d rehearsed for this moment her entire life. Beside her stood Hela, silent as a statue, eyes fixed on Agatha with something unreadable, something that almost looked like grief before it hardened into ice.</span></p><p><span>“Roll it,” Evanora ordered. Seren, smirking, tapped the feed live. Notifications flared across the phones, millions of viewers flooding in instantly. The Seventh Veil’s audience had been primed, and now the whole world was watching.</span></p><p><span>Agatha squinted against the light. “You should at least have sprung for good lighting. I look washed out.”</span></p><p><span>The livestream exploded instantly.</span></p><p><em><span>“AGATHA???”</span></em><em><span><br/></span></em> <em><span>“What the hell is this?!”</span></em><em><span><br/></span></em> <em><span>“Evanora HARKNESS is behind the Seventh Veil?!  Agatha’s own mother?”</span></em><em><span><br/></span></em> <em><span>“WHERE IS RIO?!”</span></em></p><p><span>The comments flooded faster than Seren could moderate. Tens of thousands, then hundreds. Agatha couldn’t see the numbers, but she could </span><em><span>feel</span></em><span> it, like the roar of a crowd.</span></p><p><span>Evanora sneered. “They don’t care about you. Not really. They’ll turn on you the moment I show them the truth.”</span></p><p><span>“What truth? That I have terrible taste in exes?” Agatha quipped, flicking her gaze at Hela.</span></p><p><span>The corner of Hela’s jaw flexed.</span></p><p><span>The comments scrolled faster:</span></p><p><span><br/></span> <em><span>“She’s still funny?? Even now??”</span></em><em><span><br/></span></em> <em><span>“RIO HELP HER”</span></em><em><span><br/></span></em> <em><span>“Her own mother is behind all that's happened to Agatha?! That's messed up.”</span></em><em><span><br/></span></em> <em><span>“Don’t let them win, Agatha!”</span></em></p><p><span>Evanora circled Agatha slowly, the click of her heels echoing through the cavernous set. “Do you see this woman?” she said, her voice carrying, smooth as oil. “The world calls her a star. They call her powerful, beautiful, untouchable. They worship her.”</span></p><p><span>She stopped abruptly, crouching to meet Agatha’s eye. Her hand shot out, </span><em><span>crack!</span></em><span> Across Agatha’s face. The sound echoed. Blood welled at Agatha’s lip, but she refused to look away.</span></p><p><span>“They should not worship her,” Evanora hissed, gripping Agatha’s chin hard enough to bruise. “They should be revolted by her.”</span></p><p><span>The livestream chat exploded in a flood of horrified comments. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s smirk, though faint, cut through the blood. “A bit theatrical, don’t you think, Mother? I give it a six out of ten. The punch could use more commitment.”</span></p><p><span>Evanora snarled, slamming her fist into Agatha’s stomach. Agatha doubled slightly, coughing, but still managed to wheeze, “Better. Seven.”</span></p><p><span>“You mock me even now,” Evanora spat, grabbing a fistful of her hair and forcing her head back so the cameras could catch her face. “Tell me, world, does she look divine now? Does she look powerful?”</span></p><p><span>She threw Agatha down, then turned to the cameras, her voice swelling with fury. “You don’t know who she really is. You don’t know what I gave up to bring her into this world. Do you think her talent, her fame, her beauty, all of it, was hers? No. It was mine. She owes me her life. She owes me everything. And what did she give me in return?”</span></p><p><span>She stalked back, striking Agatha across the cheek again, the sound sharp and ugly. “Nothing but shame. Nothing but sin.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha spat blood to the side, lifting her gaze with defiance. “You’ve hated me since I could crawl. Why? Why was it never enough, Evanora?”</span></p><p><span>For the first time, Evanora’s face twisted into something raw, primal. Her voice shook with venom. “Because you were born evil. Because I felt it, even before you drew your first breath. I should have killed you before you left my body. I should have snuffed you out before the world ever saw you.”</span></p><p><span>The words hung in the air, heavy and vicious. The livestream chat exploded, fans screaming in disbelief, horror, rage.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s laugh was broken, but it was still a laugh. “And yet here I am. All the talent, all the love, all the power you’ll never touch. Doesn’t that burn you, Mother? That no matter how hard you try, I’ll never belong to you.”</span></p><p><span>Evanora’s fist cracked against her jaw again, snapping her head sideways. Hela flinched, almost imperceptibly, but did not move. Her jaw clenched, eyes flicking briefly away from the cameras.</span></p><p><span>Evanora loomed over Agatha, breathing hard, her hands trembling with rage. “You are a disgrace. A parasite. A disgusting sinner playing goddess while the world bows. But tonight, they will see you as I have always seen you. Weak. Pitiful. Broken.”</span></p><p><span>She seized Agatha’s chin again, forcing her face toward the lens. “Look at her, world. Look at your so-called star. This is what she truly is.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s swollen lip curled into a bloody smile. “Still better than you.”</span></p><p><span>The chat exploded again, Agatha’s fans refusing to accept the narrative Evanora tried to spin. </span></p><p><span>WE BELIEVE IN YOU AGATHA! </span></p><p><span>YOU ARE OUR STAR!</span></p><p><span>HANG ON, RIO’S COMING!</span></p><p><span>Evanora’s fury sharpened. She raised her hand again, but this time she hesitated, her eyes flicking toward Hela. The ex-lover’s face was unreadable, carved from stone, but her fingers twitched at her side as though she’d reached for a weapon and thought better of it.</span></p><p><span>Agatha saw it, and for a heartbeat her heart clenched, not with fear, but with memory. The woman who had once held her, once whispered love against her skin, still lived somewhere inside that rigid frame. But the coldness in Hela’s eyes told her it wasn’t enough. Not anymore.</span></p><p><span>Agatha raised her chin, blood dripping, voice raw but steady. “Go on then, Mother. Hit me again. All you’ll prove is what I’ve always known: that I was never the monster here. You were.”</span></p><p><span>Evanora’s hand trembled as it hovered above her, her fury and need for control warring with the undeniable truth in Agatha’s words. She snarled, lowering her hand only to strike again, harder, desperate now.</span></p><p><span>The livestream roared, a chorus of outrage and devotion. And though every blow landed, every bruise bloomed, Agatha’s spirit only burned brighter, her sarcasm a shield stronger than any Rio could have given her.</span></p><p><span>Back at the house., Rio was pacing like a caged wolf.</span></p><p><span>Alice had the stream mirrored on every screen. Natasha, Yelena, and Bucky were gearing up fast. Maria was barking orders into a secure line.</span></p><p><span>“She’s stalling them,” Natasha said under her breath, eyes on the feed. “Buying us time.”</span></p><p><span>“Or trying to provoke them,” Yelena added, checking her sidearm.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s fists clenched. “Every second she’s in there, Evanora’s breaking her down. We have to move.”</span></p><p><span>“We don’t have location confirmed yet,” Alice shot back, fingers flying over her keyboard. “Give me a few </span><em><span>minutes.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>“We don’t have a few minutes!” Rio snapped, voice breaking. “She’s bleeding on camera and cracking jokes, how long do you think she can keep that up?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s face filled the screen then, blood at her lip, but a smirk cutting through it.</span></p><p><span>“Funny thing about family,” she said to the camera. “They’re supposed to love you. Mine just livestreams me getting slapped. Five stars on Yelp, would not recommend.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s chest constricted. God, she loved her.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned on the table, knuckles white. “I swear to God, if we don’t get there in time—”</span></p><p><span>“You will,” Maria cut in sharply. Her tone brooked no argument. “You’ve been with her through worse. You’ll get her through this.”</span></p><p><span>Rio closed her eyes, forcing a breath. “Hold on, mi amor,” she whispered. “I’m coming.”</span></p><p><span>On the stream, Evanora grew more unhinged with each passing second.</span></p><p><span>She yanked Agatha’s head back by the hair, eyes wild. “Smile for them now, darling. Show them your ugly side.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha bared her teeth, a parody of a smile. “You always did love directing. Shame you were never any good at it.”</span></p><p><span>The comments exploded. Seren cursed, trying to wrestle with the flood of text.</span></p><p><span>Hela stood in the shadows, knife glinting, chest rising faster now. Watching Agatha defy every blow. Watching her </span><em><span>endure.</span></em><span> Something burned in her eyes, jealousy, rage, a flicker of that old love. It was impossible to tell which would win.</span></p><p><span>Agatha, still bleeding, still bound, tipped her chin at the camera and smirked again.</span></p><p><span>The livestream timer ticked past twelve minutes. In internet time, that was an eternity, long enough for the world to light up, long enough for fury to harden into action.</span></p><p><span>“Got it,” Alice breathed. Her fingers flew, splitting windows, pulling satellite overlays and municipal records into a dizzying lattice. “Power draw spike at a decommissioned soundstage in Sunland, Stage 14. Someone’s piggybacking broadcast bandwidth off an old fiber trunk. That’s your feed.”</span></p><p><span>“Gear up,” Maria snapped. “Widows on point. Barton on Overwatch. Barnes with Vidal. I’m calling LAPD to cordon the outer blocks, but we'll go first.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re not cleared,” Natasha said to Rio without looking up, already clipping a blade to her thigh.</span></p><p><span>“I don’t care,” Rio shot back, voice iron. “She’s in there.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky stepped in before the argument could flare. “You’re with me, Cap,” he said in the old way, half-tease, half-battle cry. </span></p><p><span>The van rolled dark, quiet, breath held. In the back, Yelena checked a compact SMG with the humming, content energy of a cat about to knock over a priceless vase. Natasha’s eyes were half-lidded, and that calm she wore like armor. </span></p><p><span>Alice spoke in their ears. “Two heat signatures on the roof, lookouts. Four on the ground level at the south loading bay. One on the catwalks, moving. And a cluster in the main stage. That’s your show.”</span></p><p><span>“And Seren?” Maria asked.</span></p><p><span>“Main stage, behind a control bank. Hands on the stream.”</span></p><p><span>“Cute,” Yelena muttered. “We cut the hands.”</span></p><p><span>“Rules of engagement,” Maria said. “Alive if possible.”</span></p><p><span>“Alive,” Yelena echoed, like the word tasted wrong.</span></p><p><span>The van braked in the shadows. Doors opened, and the night breathed cold.</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped out last, pain like a private storm moving under her skin, and beyond it, a discipline honed to a razor. She rolled her shoulder gently, breath measured. Every nerve said </span><em><span>go</span></em><span>. The part of her that had died on a sidewalk a few months ago said </span><em><span>Don’t ever stop</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>“On me,” Natasha murmured.</span></p><p><span>The team split, each person going exactly where they needed to be.</span></p><p><span>Clint ghosted up a fire escape with a long case. Sixty seconds later, two soft thwips and the roof lookouts went still, stunned, zip-tied by lines that descended out of nowhere.</span></p><p><span>Yelena slid along the southern wall, knife flying through the air towards the door cam, disabling it. Natasha flowed past her, a flash of dark and metal, and two guards dropped without a sound, one sleeping, one whimpering gently around a dislocated shoulder.</span></p><p><span>Bucky took the north side, moving like a shadow with weight. A guard blinked, and then the world tilted as Bucky knocked him unconscious with a precise elbow to the temple.</span></p><p><span>“Perimeter clear,” Clint said in the comms. “You’ve got one on catwalks.”</span></p><p><span>“Mine,” Yelena sang.</span></p><p><span>“Yelena,” Natasha warned.</span></p><p><span>“Alive,” Yelena sighed. “Probably.”</span></p><p><span>Inside, the soundstage was all ghosts and scaffolds. Every footstep kicked dust. Somewhere, a generator thrummed, steady as a threat.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s chest tightened when she saw the glow through the thin seam of the main-stage doors, the too-bright white of production lights. She heard Evanora’s voice before she saw her, high and fevered, the brittle edge of someone who’d bet everything on a single hand.</span></p><p><span>“—and you thought they loved you,” Evanora spat, words knifing through the air. “They love a </span><em><span>mask</span></em><span>. I’ll peel it for them.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s laugh slid out like velvet and steel. “Good luck, Mother. I’ve been doing my own makeup since I was seven.”</span></p><p><span>The team fanned out along the doors, weapons drawn, nerves tuned to a razor’s edge. Maria raised three fingers. Two. One.</span></p><p><span>They breached.</span></p><p><span>The old film set blazed under harsh lights, once-grand walls now peeling flats. Cables snaked across the floor, cameras on tripods blinking red. At the control desk, Seren jolted, feral-eyed, her hands flying over keys. Hela’s hooded head snapped up from the shadows. And Evanora—Evanora turned, lips curling, eyes catching the sniper red dots trained on her and then on Rio.</span></p><p><span>For one stretched beat, everything narrowed to that line of sight: predator and protector recognizing each other across the set.</span></p><p><span>Agatha saw Rio then. Relief cracked through her mask, the smallest drop in a drought. But she smoothed it over in the next breath, tilting her chin with a bloody smirk.</span></p><p><span><br/></span><span>“About time,” she drawled. “I was about to start reading monologues.”</span></p><p><span>“Cut the stream,” Maria barked.</span></p><p><span>Seren slammed her hands on the board. The feed stuttered, then doubled, stronger, filling every screen in the world. Her grin was jagged, fever-bright. “Say hi to the world, heroes.”</span></p><p><span>A knife thunked into the desk an inch from her palm. Yelena leaned in, voice honey-sweet. “Hi. Move again, and I’ll turn your fingers into keycaps.”</span></p><p><span>Seren froze. Yelena smiled like a shark.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Rio said, and the name trembled with every way it could break.</span></p><p><span>Evanora yanked Agatha back by the rope, dragging her into the center light, face tilted to the main camera. “You don’t get to stage your own rescue,” she spat.</span></p><p><span>Hela stepped forward, not shielding Evanora, not yielding either. Her gaze cut to Agatha for a heartbeat, softening before snapping cold again.</span></p><p><span>“Hands where we can see them,” Natasha ordered, calm as iron. “Evanora Harkness, you’re under arrest for kidnapping, assault, conspiracy to murder, and a list my wife will enjoy reading in court.”</span></p><p><span>Evanora’s laugh was jagged glass. “Arrest me? It should be you on trial!”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t wait for the theatrics. She stepped in, pistol steady, voice low and lethal. “Step away from her. Now.”</span></p><p><span>“And if I don’t?” Evanora purred.</span></p><p><span>“Then I make you,” Rio said flatly.</span></p><p><span>Bucky slid left, drawing Hela’s line. Clint’s red dot settled at Hela’s shoulder seam. Yelena clamped Seren’s wrist in a lock. Natasha advanced like weather moving in, calm and unstoppable.</span></p><p><span>It might have ended there.</span></p><p><span>But Evanora’s gaze snagged on the monitor where chat screamed in real time: </span></p><p><em><span>RIO’S HERE!!</span></em></p><p><em><span>EVANORA GO TO HELL!!</span></em></p><p><em><span>GET HER RIO!!</span></em></p><p><span>Something in her cracked. She leaned in so close to Agatha that their foreheads almost touched. “You think they love you?” she hissed. “Watch them love this.”</span></p><p><span>Her knife hand twitched.</span></p><p><span>Rio fired.</span></p><p><span>The shot blew through Evanora’s wrist. The blade clattered to the floor. Evanora shrieked, blood blooming bright.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t,” Rio growled.</span></p><p><span>That was when Hela moved. Knife flashing, jealousy like wildfire, she lunged straight for Agatha’s throat.</span></p><p><span>Steel rang, the sound of Bucky intercepting her, blades sparking as violence became language. Hela fought like a dancer turned to a weapon: coiled, ruthless, each strike meant to kill. Bucky answered with soldier’s precision, blocking, twisting, punishing with weight instead of speed. The floor cracked under their feet.</span></p><p><span>“Rotate!” Rio snapped, instincts overriding pain.</span></p><p><span>Bucky disengaged. Hela spun and met Rio head-on.</span></p><p><span>Her ribs screamed, her shoulder burned electric, but Rio didn’t care. She let the knife graze her side, stepped inside Hela’s arc, and slammed her pistol butt into Hela’s wrist. Metal clanged. The blade skittered.</span></p><p><span>Hela went barehanded, clawing for Rio’s throat. Rio pivoted, caught her wrist, and flipped her hard to the concrete. Hela rolled, cat-fast, and drew a backup knife. Of course, she had one.</span></p><p><span>They circled, breaths ragged.</span></p><p><span>“Always had a thing for brunnettes,” Hela hissed, eyes flicking to Agatha. “But this one? She’ll break.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled without humor. “Not before you.”</span></p><p><span>Hela struck high, low, and fast. Rio countered with the discipline of someone who spent her life fighting. A knee to the sternum, a twist of the wrist, a headbutt that cracked bone. Blood ran hot down her collar, but she pressed forward, relentless.</span></p><p><span>For a heartbeat, Hela backed off from Rio, and the world narrowed, just Agatha and Hela, staring at each other across the set they fell in love on. The old scenery loomed like hollow ghosts of the life they’d once dreamed together.</span></p><p><span>“You could have walked away,” Agatha spat, voice raw. Blood streaked her lip, but her eyes burned hotter than the lights overhead. “You could have </span><em><span>stayed with me.</span></em><span> But instead, you sold me out. You killed Billy. You betrayed everything we had.”</span></p><p><span>Hela’s smile was sharp and broken. “We never had anything but lies, Agatha. You, the star. Me, the shadow. You think I didn’t notice? You think I didn’t know I’d always come second to your fans, to your coven, to your shine?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s laugh cracked, harsh and furious. “Second? You were </span><em><span>first.</span></em><span> You were my first love, my first home. And I still had no ill will toward you, not even after you broke my heart, that was, until I learned you were the rat. Until you made my worst nightmares real.”</span></p><p><span>For the first time, Hela faltered. Rage flickered with something else, something that looked dangerously like regret. “I did what I had to,” she whispered, and for a flash it wasn’t the assassin speaking, but the girl who once shared her jacket with Agatha on a drafty set, who once kissed her under buzzing stage lights like it was the whole world.</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head, grief cutting through her anger. “No. You did what you </span><em><span>wanted.</span></em><span> And you wanted to destroy me more than you ever wanted to love me.”</span></p><p><span>That landed. Hela’s face twisted, fury fighting with a flicker of pain, old love clashing with the ruin she’d chosen.</span></p><p><span>Then, just for a breath, Hela looked at Agatha.</span><span><br/><br/></span></p><p><span>The longing was naked, raw, before it hardened into fury. And Rio knew.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t,” Rio warned.</span></p><p><span>But Hela smirked. “If I cant have her, you don’t get to have her.”</span></p><p><span>She pivoted, faster than breath, and flung the knife at Agatha.</span></p><p><span>Rio was already moving. She caught the arc, body intercepting steel. Pain exploded under her collarbone as the blade bit shallow, slowed by her vest. Hela lunged again for Agatha.</span></p><p><span>Yelena’s pistol coughed. “For Billy.”</span></p><p><span>Hela’s body crumpled, lifeless, strings cut.</span></p><p><span>Silence. Then Agatha’s ragged breath, Evanora’s screech, Seren’s whimper.</span></p><p><span>Rio staggered, blood slick down her chest, but forced her hands steady as she cut Agatha free. “I’ve got you,” she rasped.</span></p><p><span>Agatha surged into her arms, half sob, half laugh. “You always do.”</span></p><p><span>Maria’s voice snapped, “Cut the stream.”</span></p><p><span>Alice’s voice crackled over comms: “Feed dead. Whole world just saw the ending. Hashtags trending already.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha had Evanora by the wrist, twisting her down to her knees as she thrashed. “Don’t,” Nat said calmly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned, eyes sharp as glass. “They saw you hit me, Mother. They saw what you are. I never had to prove a thing. You did that yourself.”</span></p><p><span>Evanora spat, “You’ll never be rid of me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned closer, voice cold steel. “No. You’ll rot in prison. That’s your legacy.”</span></p><p><span>Sirens wailed outside. Maria barked orders, cops surged in. Seren was zip-tied and dragged, Yelena blowing her a sarcastic kiss. Bucky bent to close Hela’s eyes, face unreadable.</span></p><p><span>And Rio, Rio sat hard, finally letting gravity win, blood blooming dark across her chest. Agatha caught her, furious and tender all at once.</span></p><p><span>“You promised me,” Agatha whispered, tears streaking.</span></p><p><span>“I kept it,” Rio breathed. “Still here. Always.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha kissed her, fierce and trembling, as the cameras were hauled away, as Evanora screamed and was shoved into cuffs, as the night shifted from chaos to aftermath.</span></p><p><span>The fight was over.</span></p><p><span>They had won.</span></p>

And with Rio and Agatha dating, Rio will never be too far.</span></p><p><b>@OurWitchAgatha</b><span>: She’s safe. That’s all that matters. Thank you SHIELD. Thank you Rio.</span></p><p><span>In the living room, Agatha sat very still on the couch, her fingers linked with Rio’s like a lifeline.</span></p><p><span>“Well,” Agatha murmured, exhaling. “That’s one way to make an exit.”</span></p><p><span>Rio gave a small shake of her head, jaw tight. “Not an exit. Just a change in perimeter.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky leaned against the wall, nodding. “She’s right. You’ll still have backup when you need it. But the world saw Rio take a knife for you. Nobody doubts she’ll still be glued to your side.”</span></p><p><span>“More like stapled,” Yelena muttered, sprawled in a chair. “But fine. Better her than me.”</span></p><p><span>That pulled a weak laugh from Wanda, and even Agatha’s lips quirked, though her eyes shimmered with unspoken relief.</span></p><p><span>“Speaking of,” Maria said as she entered from the hall, jacket slung over her arm. Her voice softened, rare in its warmth. “It’s time.”</span></p><p><span>The words landed heavily.</span></p><p><span>For months, the house had been full of agents, a war camp disguised as a home. Now the team was packing duffels, stowing gear, and preparing to leave the constant guard behind.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stood, her hands tightening around Rio’s before she let go. “No,” she said softly. “Not like that. We’re not ending this like it’s another mission. We’re a family. So if you’re walking out that door, you better be prepared to come back once a week. Movie night, game night. Bring your partners, your kids. I don’t care. You don’t get to leave me like this.”</span></p><p><span>Silence, then Clint grinned, tired and warm. “Laura’s gonna love you for this.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky smirked faintly. “Sam won’t shut up about wanting to beat Barton at charades.”</span></p><p><span>“Kate’s going to make me watch </span><em><span>Mean Girls</span></em><span> again,” Yelena muttered.</span></p><p><span>Natasha’s smile was small but real, her eyes finding Maria’s. “Guess I’ll finally learn how to play Uno.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha sniffed, lifting her chin. “Uno is sacred. Don’t cheat.”</span></p><p><span>Rio slipped an arm around her waist, tugging her close. “She will cheat,” she said dryly. “She’s terrible at losing.”</span></p><p><span>“Not true,” Agatha argued, resting her head on Rio’s shoulder. “I just refuse to accept it.”</span></p><p><span>The goodbyes lingered at the door, heavier than anyone admitted. Natasha embraced Agatha firmly before stepping back into Maria’s orbit. Yelena hugged her quickly, whispering something about </span><em><span>keeping Rio out of trouble.</span></em><span> Clint kissed her cheek and promised baked goods from the Barton kids. Bucky clasped Rio’s shoulder, murmuring, “She’s yours now. But we’re still here.”</span></p><p><span>When the SUVs pulled out of the drive, the house felt emptier. But the echoes of laughter, of promises made, lingered like incense.</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled, leaning into Rio. “So… it’s just us now.”</span></p><p><span>Rio kissed her hair. “Just us.”</span></p><p><span>“Good,” Agatha said softly, glancing at Billy’s photo on the mantle. “Because I’m not letting anyone else pick the movie next week.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stood in the middle of her living room, if it could still be called that, staring at the space where her team had just been. It felt both too empty and too full at once, like the air still hummed with all their voices.</span></p><p><span>Rio eased down onto the couch with the carefulness of someone still mindful of healing scars. She patted the cushion beside her. “Come sit before you start haunting the house like a gothic heroine.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked, then gave a weak laugh, crossing over and curling into her side. “You make it sound like I’d look dramatic in cobwebs.”</span></p><p><span>“You’d look dramatic in a potato sack,” Rio muttered, pressing a kiss into her hair.</span></p><p><span>“I know I said it before, but I don’t want to live in this place anymore,” Agatha said, studying the room after a beat of silence.</span></p><p><span>Rio pulled back a little to study her, eyes sweeping the room, landing on the reinforced windows, the camera tucked high in the corner, the faint gouges in the floorboards from one too many frantic nights. “This house has been nothing but a battlefield since the day I walked in. You deserve better than to keep reliving every fight in your living room.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled, leaning her head against Rio’s shoulder. “I was just thinking the same thing. I can’t look at the steps to downstairs without remembering the night Billy—” Her voice cracked. She swallowed hard. “Wanda’s been saying the same thing about their place. Too many ghosts.”</span></p><p><span>“Then it’s settled,” Rio said simply. “We move. You and me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha tilted her head, a sly smile tugging at her lips. “Oh? Straight to the practical talk, no dramatic proposal?”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked faintly. “Agatha, you already asked me at the cabin. Unless you want me to get on one knee and make a PowerPoint about mortgages, I figured we were past the dramatics.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted, laughter cutting through the heaviness. “Okay, fair. But if we’re going to do this, we need to agree on what we want.”</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned back, stretching her legs out. “Something low-key. Not too big. Modern lines, clean space. Something where we don’t feel like we’re living in a museum or on display.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes widened. “Modern? You want us to live in a glass box like the Bond villain’s lair you currently live in?”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked. “I said modern, not a fish tank. I just don’t need a castle, mi vida. I want a place that feels lived in, where we can actually breathe.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha crossed her arms, mock-offended. “Well, I was imagining something a little bigger. Enough space for the team to crash when they inevitably invite themselves over. Maybe stone walls, ivy crawling up the side. Something with a witches-cottage-meets-manor vibe.”</span></p><p><span>Rio arched a brow. “You want to live in a fairytale.”</span></p><p><span>“I am a fairytale,” Agatha shot back, grinning. “Besides, you’d look fantastic standing in front of a stone fireplace in a cozy sweater.”</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned but couldn’t hide her smile. “You’re impossible.”</span></p><p><span>“You love it.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes, yes, I do,” Rio said, brushing her thumb over Agatha’s knuckles.</span></p><p><span>They fell into a comfortable silence for a beat, both imagining futures layered over the present. Then Agatha perked up. “But we do agree on one thing.”</span></p><p><span>Rio tilted her head. “What’s that?”</span></p><p><span>“A pool,” Agatha said firmly. “Non-negotiable. I want to host pool parties. Margarita nights. Float around with you all day when we’re too tired to do anything else.”</span></p><p><span>Rio chuckled. “Fine. A pool. That I can agree to.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked satisfied, leaning into her again. “See, we’re halfway there already.”</span></p><p><span>Rio kissed her temple, thoughtful. “You mentioned Wanda earlier. About moving.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded. “She’s been saying it a lot. Every room in their house reminds her of Billy. She wants a fresh start, somewhere Tommy doesn’t feel like he’s walking through a mausoleum.”</span></p><p><span>Rio hummed in thought. “What if we looked together? Not the same house, obviously,” she added quickly, seeing Agatha’s raised brow. “But maybe the same neighborhood. Or even a piece of land where two houses can be built. One for us, one for the Maximoffs. That way you’re close. They’re close. Everyone has space, but no one’s alone.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked, visibly moved. “You’ve really thought about this.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shrugged, suddenly self-conscious. “I know how much Wanda means to you. To both of us. And if this past year has proven anything, it’s that family, found or otherwise, needs to stay close. We could build something. Together.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s smile softened, a rare blend of mischievous and tender. “You’re full of surprises, Vidal.”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t get used to it,” Rio muttered, though her eyes warmed.</span></p><p><span>Agatha curled closer, her voice hushed now. “I like the idea. All of it. A new house, a new start. With you. With Wanda nearby. Somewhere that doesn’t feel like a battlefield.”</span></p><p><span>Rio brushed a stray strand of hair from her face, her tone steady. “Then we’ll start looking. Tour houses, check out land. Whatever it takes until we find the one that feels like home.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha kissed her then, slow and certain, tasting like the promise of something brighter. When they pulled back, her eyes glinted with playful mischief again. “But seriously. Stone walls.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed, shaking her head. “We’ll see.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked, triumphant already. “That’s not a no.”</span></p><p><span>Rio kissed her again just to shut her up, and for the first time in too long, the house didn’t feel haunted anymore.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>House-hunting with Agatha and Rio was chaos, Wanda decided. Organized chaos, maybe, but chaos all the same.</span></p><p><span>The first house they toured was sleek and modern, with floor-to-ceiling windows and white walls that screamed “don’t touch me.” Rio walked through the kitchen like a general inspecting troops, tugging on the built-in range hood and running her palm along the marble countertops. “I could cook here,” she admitted with a nod.</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned against the counter, smirking. “Oh, I could think of a few things we could do here.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda didn’t even hesitate; she whipped out the spray bottle Jen had shoved into her bag that morning, spritzing Agatha square in the shoulder. “Behave,” Wanda scolded.</span></p><p><span>Agatha gasped dramatically. “Are you serious right now?!”</span></p><p><span>“Jen warned me,” Wanda deadpanned. “Said the two of you need constant supervision.”</span></p><p><span>Rio chuckled under her breath, muttering, “She’s not wrong.”</span></p><p><span>By the third house, Agatha was making a game out of seeing how fast she could make Rio blush. In the library of an old Tudor, she whispered, “Just imagine bending me over this desk…” only to yelp when Wanda spritzed her again.</span></p><p><span>Rio, face pink, just muttered, “I hate you both.”</span></p><p><span>The day rolled on in a blur of hardwood floors, echoing staircases, and Agatha’s increasingly inappropriate commentary. At one ranch-style home, she dragged Rio into the pantry and whispered something so outrageous that Rio nearly dropped the shelving bracket she was testing. Wanda groaned and sprayed them both this time.</span></p><p><span>By the fifth house, Wanda was threatening to move without them if Agatha didn’t stop.</span></p><p><span>And then they saw it.</span></p><p><span>The stone-front house with the sloped roof, warm lights glowing in every window like it had been waiting just for them. A firepit nestled into the patio, a pool glittering under string lights, and a guesthouse at the back that practically begged to be turned into a game room.</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze in the entryway, fingers brushing the rustic wood banister. “It feels…like the cabin,” she whispered, glancing at Rio.</span></p><p><span>Rio walked slowly through the kitchen, eyes softening at the sight of the wide farmhouse sink, the six-burner stove, the sprawling counter space. “Yeah,” she murmured. “Big enough for everyone. But still home.”</span></p><p><span>Six bedrooms, five and a half bathrooms, a living room large enough for movie nights and family chaos, a large library, and a study, it was everything they didn’t know they were looking for.</span></p><p><span>“This is it,” Agatha said firmly, curling her fingers through Rio’s.</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded once, decisive. “This is it.”</span></p><p><span>Two houses down, Wanda found her own perfect fit: a cozy five-bedroom with a pool curving under a canopy of green. She could already picture Tommy’s laughter echoing in the yard, the garden Vision would plant, the dinners they’d host.</span></p><p><span>When the realtor mentioned the proximity, Agatha nearly squealed. “Wanda, we’re going to be neighbors!”</span></p><p><span>Wanda gave her a long-suffering look. “I suppose that means I’ll need two spray bottles.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha grinned. “Three. Just in case.”</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned, but even she couldn’t stop the smile tugging at her lips.</span></p><p><span>For the first time in a long time, it felt like they weren’t just surviving. They were building something together.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Two months later, the house was no longer just walls and beams; it was home. Agatha and Rio had officially moved in, with more help than they knew what to do with. The entire S.H.I.E.L.D. team had shown up like an unofficial moving company, dragging boxes, assembling furniture, and occasionally arguing over which direction the couch should face. Wanda and Vision had settled comfortably into their own home just down the street, and the cul-de-sac that once felt ordinary now felt like the center of a very peculiar universe.</span></p><p><span>By the time the last box was unpacked, the place already bore their fingerprints: Agatha’s shelves stacked with books and scripts, Rio’s knives gleaming in the kitchen, photos of the whole mismatched family tucked along the mantle and hallways.</span></p><p><span>Laura Barton and Rio had gravitated to each other almost immediately. Within hours of meeting, they were in the backyard, trading tips on herb gardens and meal prep, comparing how often they had to rein in Clint and Agatha’s wilder impulses. “I swear,” Laura had laughed, handing Rio a basket of fresh tomatoes she’d brought from her farm, “keeping Clint out of trouble is a full-time job.”</span></p><p><span>Rio snorted, leaning against the new stone counter. “Try keeping Agatha from flirting with the realtor when we toured this place.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha, passing by with a wine glass, only smirked. “Flirtation got us a better price. You’re welcome.”</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, Kate Bishop and Agatha had discovered a shared love for chaos. Within minutes, Kate was sprawled across Agatha’s new sofa with her shoes kicked off, excitedly suggesting ways to test the acoustics of the new house. “We should see how loud we can get music going before Rio comes storming in to yell at us.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes lit up. “Or karaoke. Imagine Wanda trying to belt Adele at midnight.”</span></p><p><span>“Not happening,” Wanda called from the kitchen, but the smirk tugging at her lips betrayed her amusement.</span></p><p><span>Rio pinched the bridge of her nose. “God help me.”</span></p><p><span>Bucky and Yelena meanwhile were arguing over the proper way to start a fire, Steve was cutting the wood needed for the fire, and when they argument turned physical between Yelena and Bucky, Sonya stepped in laughing and shaking her head at the childish antics, dragging the small angry Russian inside to her girlfriend who listened and tried not to laugh at Yelena’s dramatic retelling of the argument.</span></p><p><span>Sam Wilson found his place beside Rio easily, the two of them slipping into an easy camaraderie forged from shared military history. They compared scars like badges, trading stories over a couple of beers while everyone else bustled around them. “So how do you like this new life you’ve built?” Sam asked quietly.</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled softly. “Didn’t think I’d get a second chance. Certainly didn’t think it’d look like this.” She glanced across the room, where Agatha was dramatically gesturing at Kate about paint colors. “But I’ll take it.”</span></p><p><span>Sam grinned. “She’s good for you.”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah,” Rio said softly. “She really is.”</span></p><p><span>The housewarming turned into a party before either Agatha or Rio could stop it. Lilia showed up with bottles of wine, Natasha and Maria slipped in late with armfuls of groceries, Clint brought sparklers for no reason other than “it felt right,” and Tommy darted between both houses with Wanda trying, unsuccessfully, to keep him from sneaking cookies before dinner. Alice and Jen, now officially together, much to the enjoyment of everyone, showed up with almost half a dozen pizzas.</span></p><p><span>By the end of the night, the firepit was blazing, the pool lights reflected across the water, and everyone lounged around in varying states of exhaustion and laughter. Rio sat with Agatha tucked against her side, their new home alive with warmth and voices.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t just a house. It was a safe place, a new chapter. And for the first time in what felt like forever, both of them allowed themselves to believe they’d earned it.</span></p><p><span>.</span></p><p><span>Three weeks after the last moving box was flattened and slid into the garage, the new house had settled into a rhythm that felt suspiciously like peace. Morning light spilled through the kitchen’s tall windows; Rio’s herbs, basil, thyme, a brave little rosemary, had already claimed the sunniest sill; and Agatha had reorganized the pantry three times because “chaos is a creative choice, darling.” Their days were a mix of small domestic things, Rio experimenting with sourdough starts; Agatha pretending not to eat the evidence, and normal work, which finally looked normal again.</span></p><p><span>So when Jen strode in one late afternoon, tablet in hand and the kind of smile that meant “great news that will also be a problem,” both women paused mid-banter.</span></p><p><span>“Before you say anything,” Agatha warned, lounging at the island in loose linen, “if this is about another magazine wanting to photograph us 'candidly' in the grocery store, I’ll stage a dramatic faint in the produce aisle.”</span></p><p><span>“Tempting,” Jen said, dropping her bag on a chair. “But no. This is better. Or scarier. Depends on your tolerance for soft couches and America’s favorite chaos aunt.”</span></p><p><span>Rio looked up from the cutting board, knife hovering over a pile of cilantro. “Define chaos, Aunt.”</span></p><p><span>“Drew Barrymore,” Jen said, like a magician revealing the card you picked.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyebrows shot up. “Oh.”</span></p><p><span>“Joint interview,” Jen continued. “Her team reached out directly. They want a long sit-down, talking about your relationship, the Seventh Veil, Rio’s recovery, and the infamous photoshoot that launched a thousand thirsty tweets. Drew wants to do it her way: warm, candid, human. She’ll also play a silly game at the end because she’s physically incapable of not bringing out a bowl of popsicle sticks with questions written on them.”</span></p><p><span>Rio set the knife down very carefully. “I don’t…do interviews.”</span></p><p><span>“I know,” Jen said evenly. “And I’d never push you into a machine interview. But Drew’s team promised no gotcha, no ambush. She’s been there for survivors. She’s big on boundaries. You can set lines before the cameras roll.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned on her stool, softening. “What do you think, my love?”</span></p><p><span>Rio kept her gaze on the cutting board for a long beat. “I’m not afraid of telling the truth,” she said, voice pitched low. “I’m wary of…putting it in a place where it gets edited into something else.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s fair,” Jen said. “We’ll get editorial input. And her producers are willing to let Alice monitor in real time for safety, no live feed, nothing that could be hijacked. You’d approve everything.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s throat worked. She looked like she was weighing the cost of something heavy and then measuring it against Agatha’s face. “Would it help?” she asked finally. “To talk about it. To talk about us.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s smile curved, edges fragile and real. “It might help me,” she said. “And it would help them, the people who stuck with us when everything felt impossible.”</span></p><p><span>Rio exhaled through her nose, and Agatha could see the moment some internal knot loosened. “Okay,” she said. “But if she makes me play charades on television, I’m invoking the Geneva Conventions.”</span></p><p><span>Jen’s grin flashed. “I can work with ‘okay.’ We’re looking at two weeks from today. She's in Burbank. I’ll send pre-interview questions, and you can strike anything that feels like a landmine. And for the record,” she added, glancing at Rio with a softer steadiness, “you don’t owe the world anything. You choose this because it helps you. Or not at all.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded. The guard in her eyes eased, a fraction. “Thanks.”</span></p><p><span>After Jen left to begin a flurry of legal emails and schedule gymnastics, Agatha drifted around the island to Rio’s side. “We can say no,” she murmured, brushing her knuckles over Rio’s rib where scar tissue still pulled tight. “We can always say no.”</span></p><p><span>Rio caught her wrist and turned it, pressing a kiss to the inside. “I know. But I also know you. You’ve never been afraid of a stage.”</span></p><p><span>“I was,” Agatha said quietly. “That night on the soundstage, when—” She stopped herself before the memory could become the room. “I want to choose the stage this time.”</span></p><p><span>“Then we choose it,” Rio said simply. “Together.”</span></p><p><span>The day of the interview came wrapped in that peculiar studio sunshine, too bright, a little unreal. Drew’s set was a living room exploded into a cozy pastel dream: soft chairs, a side table with fresh flowers, a basket of cards that promised mischief. Through the wall of windows, a fake skyline glowed perfect and oblivious.</span></p><p><span>In the green room, Rio checked exits out of habit and then chided herself because today wasn’t a battle. Today was a conversation. Agatha squeezed her hand anyway.</span></p><p><span>“You look beautiful,” Agatha said, which was true. Rio wore a black suit that looked formal on anyone else and dangerous on her, shirt open at the throat, necklace glinting. The faint line of a scar peeked above her collar; she hadn’t bothered to hide it. Agatha wore deep plum silk and a smile that had stopped traffic and at least two executives’ hearts.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t look at me like that,” Rio murmured. “You’re going to make me forget how to form sentences.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s the plan,” Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>Drew swept into the green room with a hug that felt like a heated blanket. “You angels! I’m so glad you’re here.” She was barefoot in soft trousers, hair in a cheerful tumble, eyes bright with that familiar mix of empathy and mischief. “We can throw out anything you don’t like. We can stop whenever you want. We can just drink tea and talk about your herb garden if we panic.”</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked. “You know about my herbs?”</span></p><p><span>Drew beamed. “Your basil was in the background of three of Agatha’s Instagram stories. We’re doing investigative journalism here.” She squeezed Agatha’s fingers. “Thank you for trusting me.”</span></p><p><span>The lights in the studio were bright, the air buzzing with the soft murmur of a packed audience waiting for the curtain to rise. Cameras stood like patient sentries at every angle, red tally lights winking alive as the crew finished last-minute checks. Behind the velvet curtain, Rio adjusted her jacket for what felt like the tenth time, ignoring the way her pulse hammered. She’d faced ambushes, interrogations, and firefights in deserts where the heat swallowed sound. She had not, however, faced a </span><em><span>live</span></em><span> studio audience in Burbank.</span></p><p><span>“Breathe,” Agatha whispered beside her, smoothing an invisible wrinkle from Rio’s lapel. “You look devastating. Half the audience is already in love with you, and you haven’t even spoken yet.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s what I’m afraid of,” Rio muttered, scanning exits, counting cameras.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tilted her chin, dark eyes gleaming. “Darling, it’s Drew Barrymore. This is as safe as it gets. And besides—” her voice dropped low, wicked, “—if you start panicking, I’ll just distract you with innuendo.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s lips twitched despite herself. “You’re insufferable.”</span></p><p><span>“And irresistible,” Agatha shot back.</span></p><p><span>Before Rio could answer, a stagehand gestured them forward. The band kicked up Drew’s cheerful theme, the curtain parted, and applause rolled like a wave. Drew stood center stage, barefoot and glowing, arms open.</span></p><p><span>“Ladies and gentlemen, today is special,” she said over the roar. “Please welcome—</span><em><span>together for the first time on television</span></em><span>—Agatha Harkness and Rio Vidal!”</span></p><p><span>The audience leapt to their feet. Cheers, whistles, and camera flashes erupted. Rio blinked hard against the flood of sound, her body tensing automatically. Agatha, of course, drank it in, her smile wide and dazzling as she led Rio by the hand to the chairs.</span></p><p><span>They settled, Agatha crossing one elegant leg over the other, Rio stiff but steady, shoulders squared as if bracing for gunfire instead of questions. Drew perched opposite them, eyes sparkling.</span></p><p><span>“First of all,” Drew said, beaming, “thank you both. I know being here, </span><em><span>like this</span></em><span>, took a lot of thought, a lot of courage. And I think the world is grateful.”</span></p><p><span>The applause swelled again, softer this time, touched with warmth.</span></p><p><span>Agatha inclined her head graciously. “It’s us who should be grateful. To you, to them,” she gestured toward the audience, “for holding the line when things were… very dark.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shifted, uneasy under the weight of so many eyes. Her hand curled against her thigh. Agatha noticed. Without missing a beat, she leaned over, threading their fingers together. “See? Not so terrifying.”</span></p><p><span>“Give me a knife fight over this any day,” Rio muttered.</span></p><p><span>The crowd laughed. Drew grinned. “She’s funny! Who knew?”</span></p><p><span>“She’s hilarious,” Agatha said fondly. “She just doesn’t share with anyone but me.”</span></p><p><span>The audience melted at that. Rio groaned under her breath.</span></p><p><span>Drew leaned forward, conspiratorial. “Okay. Let’s get this out of the way. The photoshoot. The Suit, the Tattoos. The </span><em><span>TENSION</span></em><span>. The internet explosion.”</span></p><p><span>The audience whooped. Someone shouted, “RIOOOO!” and half the crowd laughed.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s ears went pink. “It wasn’t supposed to be me. A model called out last minute. They needed a stand-in, and Agatha was insistent that it should be me.”</span></p><p><span>“Best Decision of my life,” Agatha purred.</span></p><p><span>Applause, laughter, catcalls. Rio shook her head, muttering something in Spanish.</span></p><p><span>Drew clutched her chest dramatically. “Listen, I have lived through internet thirst. But the way the world went feral over you two? Over </span><em><span>her</span></em><span> in particular?” She mimed fanning herself. “How did that feel?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s grin went sly. “Vindicating.”</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned again, but the flush on her cheeks betrayed her. “I didn’t…expect it,” she admitted. “I’ve spent my whole life in shadows. Seeing… that reaction was strange.” She glanced at Agatha. “But if they were cheering because she was happy? Then I’ll take it.”</span></p><p><span>The audience “awwed” so loudly that Drew waved her hands like a conductor.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tilted her head. “Also, I personally enjoyed the tweets. Very creative.”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t encourage them,” Rio hissed.</span></p><p><span>“Too late,” Drew laughed.</span></p><p><span>When the laughter eased, Drew steered them into deeper waters. “Rio, I want to ask something I think everyone wonders. You run the top private security firm in the world. Why take this case personally? Why Agatha?”</span></p><p><span>Rio sat straighter, eyes flitting to the audience and back. For a moment, she looked like she might retreat behind deflection. Then she exhaled.</span></p><p><span>“Because I knew Lilia’s son,” she said. The crowd stilled. “Colten. We served together. He was good. Solid. The kind of soldier you trusted with your life.” She paused. “When Lilia came to SHIELD, she specifically asked for me to lead the team. I didn’t know who she was at first, but when she told me…I couldn’t say no. Not when it was her family.”</span></p><p><span>The audience’s silence was reverent, weighted.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hand squeezed hers. “She showed up in my life because of loyalty. And she stayed because I was relentless.”</span></p><p><span>Drew’s smile tilted. “Relentless, how?”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked faintly. “She threw every innuendo at me she could think of.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m thorough,” Agatha said, unapologetic. “And before you ask, yes, I was her first celebrity crush. Imagine my delight when she admitted it.”</span></p><p><span>The audience erupted again. Drew gasped theatrically. “Stop. You had a crush on her first?”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s flush returned. “I watched her films when I was younger and then again when I was overseas. They reminded me there was still light. That’s all.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s </span><em><span>everything,</span></em><span>” Agatha corrected softly.</span></p><p><span>For a moment, the air between them felt fragile, tender. Then Drew, an expert at shifting tones, leaned in. “Rio, you almost lost your life protecting her. More than once. People know you were hurt. They don’t know the details. What do you want them to understand?”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw flexed. “That it was ugly,” she said bluntly. “Multiple gunshots. Stab wounds, collapsed lung, internal injuries. More blood on sidewalks than anyone should see. I died. More than once. The doctors brought me back.”</span></p><p><span>The audience gasped, a ripple of shock.</span></p><p><span>“But,” Rio continued, voice steady, “I don’t regret it. Not for a second. If it meant she’s sitting here now, alive, laughing, infuriating me—” she shook her head, a ghost of a smile tugging at her lips, “then it was worth every scar.”</span></p><p><span>The audience surged to their feet in applause. Agatha blinked hard, her hand tightening on Rio’s. She kissed her knuckles without shame, eyes wet.</span></p><p><span>Drew let the moment breathe before turning gently to Agatha. “The world saw your mother. Saw what she did. How do you even begin to process that?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha drew herself tall, shoulders regal. “By naming it. It was abuse. It always was. No camera can rewrite that truth. She tried to make me a monster. Instead, she showed the world her own face.”</span></p><p><span>The audience murmured, nodding, clapping softly.</span></p><p><span>“And while I am endlessly grateful to my fans,” Agatha went on, her voice warm but firm, “I need them to hear this: I do not owe anyone my attention. Or my story. Or my pain. I share it because I choose to, not because it’s theirs to demand. Boundaries are not ingratitude. They are survival.”</span></p><p><span>A swell of applause rose again, louder this time, fierce and supportive.</span></p><p><span>Drew’s eyes glistened. “That’s…beautifully said.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smiled, then reached for Rio’s hand again. “But I do owe them gratitude. For standing by us. For refusing to let lies be louder than love.”</span></p><p><span>That earned cheers.</span></p><p><span>“And speaking of love,” Drew teased, “tell me about this new project. I’ve heard whispers.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s expression softened. “Yes. Wanda and I are starting a foundation in Billy’s name. </span><em><span>Billy’s Light.</span></em><span> It will help victims of stalking and harassment get the help, protection, and legal resources they need. We’ve partnered with S.H.I.E.L.D. because they know the cost of silence and are equipped to protect the victims like they did me.”</span></p><p><span>The audience erupted in applause, some even standing.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s smile wavered, grief threaded through pride. “No one should lose a child the way Wanda did. If we can spare even one family that pain, then Billy’s light will never go out.”</span></p><p><span>Rio slipped an arm around her shoulders, steadying her through the thunderous applause.</span></p><p><span>“For this next segment, I’ve asked the audience to send in their burning questions, the ones they </span><em><span>really</span></em><span> want answered.” Drew wiggled her brows at the crowd, who immediately erupted with cheers. “Are you two ready?”</span></p><p><span>“As ready as we’ll ever be,” Rio said, sitting with her usual composure, though the way her arm rested protectively across the back of Agatha’s chair betrayed her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked. “Oh, I was born ready.”</span></p><p><span>“Alright,” Drew grinned, glancing at the card. “First question: who made the first move?”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Rio answered without hesitation. “She was relentless from the very first meeting. She flirted so much that Jen, her publicist, actually brought a spray bottle to spray her every time she said something inappropriate toward me. Which was… a lot.”</span></p><p><span>The audience howled.</span></p><p><span>“Didn’t work,” Agatha purred, flipping her hair back dramatically. “I always get what I want. And I wanted you. Jen only made me wet with that spray bottle… just not wetter than when I’m with you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio went scarlet as the crowd exploded into screams. Drew fell forward, laughing so hard she nearly dropped her cards. “I’m crying already!”</span></p><p><span>“Next question,” Drew wheezed, trying to compose herself. “Funniest memory involving the other?”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, I got one,” Agatha said gleefully. “The first time I stayed over at Rio’s house, I went to take a shower. She came in to bring me clothes, sweet, right? Except she didn’t realize I was naked. I have </span><em><span>never</span></em><span> seen someone gay-panic so hard in my life. She ran into the door, apologized to the door, tripped over her own feet, and fell into the dresser. Funniest thing I’ve </span><em><span>ever</span></em><span> seen.”</span></p><p><span>The audience lost it. Drew had actual tears running down her cheeks.</span></p><p><span>Rio sighed like a woman resigned to her fate. “There was one time we went hiking,” she countered smoothly. “Agatha tripped over a tree root and fell face-first into a puddle. Then she panicked and nearly drowned herself… in three inches of water.”</span></p><p><span>The laughter doubled. Agatha didn’t even look embarrassed, just turned those soft, fond eyes on Rio, smiling like she’d do it all over again just to make her laugh.</span></p><p><span>Once Drew finally caught her breath, she managed, “Most annoying habit about the other one?”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha cheats at every game,” Rio said instantly. “And when she loses, because sometimes I </span><em><span>do</span></em><span> catch her, she flips tables.”</span></p><p><span>“I do not cheat!” Agatha gasped in mock offense. “I just interpret rules… creatively.”</span></p><p><span>Rio arched a brow. “Scrabble is not an interpretive game.”</span></p><p><span>The crowd roared.</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked and leaned forward. “And for Rio? It’s her savior complex. She throws herself into danger without a second thought. But…” Her hand slid into Rio’s, squeezing gently. “It’s also one of the things I love most about her. That instinct to protect, to put others first. Even when it drives me mad with worry.”</span></p><p><span>Rio squeezed back, silent but steady. The audience aww’d.</span></p><p><span>“A few more here,” Drew said, shuffling the cards. “What’s something you do to stay grounded and keep a healthy relationship, especially with the public scrutiny you both face?”</span></p><p><span>Rio tilted her head, letting Agatha take the lead.</span></p><p><span>“When the world gets too loud, we run away,” Agatha said simply. “We’ve got a place where it’s just us. No cameras, no scripts, no responsibilities. Just quiet. Just love.” She glanced sideways at Rio, and the soft smile that pulled at her lips told the audience everything they needed to know about the cabin.</span></p><p><span>Rio cleared her throat. “We also talk. We banter, we argue sometimes, but we don’t let things fester. And we surround ourselves with people who call us out. People who’ll spray us with water if we’re being dumb, or literally lock us in a room until we work it out.”</span></p><p><span>The audience erupted in laughter again. Drew clutched her chest. “That is the most adorable, and honestly, the most </span><em><span>sappy</span></em><span>, thing I’ve ever heard.”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t encourage her,” Rio muttered, though the smile tugging at her mouth betrayed her.</span></p><p><span>“Next one’s a good one,” Drew said, grinning. “What’s the most surprising thing you’ve learned about each other since getting together?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hand shot up like a kid in class. “She sings when she cooks. Badly. Off-key. Like, </span><em><span>so</span></em><span> off-key. But it’s the cutest thing I’ve ever heard, so I let her believe she’s Beyoncé.”</span></p><p><span>Rio covered her face as the crowd roared. “It keeps the kitchen morale up,” she muttered.</span></p><p><span>“And for me?” Rio added, recovering with her usual composure. “Agatha actually hates scary movies. She’ll insist on watching them to prove she’s fearless, then spend the whole night under the blanket with one eye peeking out. And she jumps at shadows for a week after.”</span></p><p><span>“I </span><em><span>do not!</span></em><span>” Agatha gasped.</span></p><p><span>“You made me check the closet for clowns,” Rio said dryly.</span></p><p><span>The audience screamed with laughter.</span></p><p><span>Drew wiped her eyes, barely holding it together. “Okay, last one, this one’s mine. What does the future look like for you two?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha and Rio looked at each other. They didn’t need words; the conversation passed in glances, the kind of silent dialogue that comes only with trust. The audience leaned in, holding their breath.</span></p><p><span>“Right now?” Agatha said finally, voice soft. “It’s to love each other. We just bought a house, our first real home together. Even though we’ve lived together twenty-four seven for the past six months, this is different. It’s not her place or mine. It’s ours. We’re building a life. I’ve got new roles coming up, Rio’s back at S.H.I.E.L.D., and we’re just taking it one step at a time. Together.”</span></p><p><span>She leaned in and kissed Rio softly, unapologetically, the crowd erupting in delighted cheers.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hand lingered at the back of her neck when they pulled apart. “That’s the only future I need,” she said simply.</span></p><p><span>The audience melted. Drew fanned herself dramatically. “Ladies and gentlemen, if you weren’t believers before, you are now. This is love.”</span></p><p><span>The applause thundered, long and loud, filling the studio with something bigger than noise, something like hope.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The night after the interview was warm, the kind of late-summer hush that carried cicadas and the faint hum of sprinklers from distant lawns. Agatha had dragged a dozen candles outside, lining the edge of the pool until their flames wavered like stars fallen to earth. The water caught the light and threw it back in ripples of gold and blue, soft and endless.</span></p><p><span>Rio sat with her legs stretched out, toes just grazing the surface, a half-empty glass of wine dangling from her fingers. The scars along her collarbone and ribs caught the glow, pale reminders of everything they’d survived. Agatha settled beside her, pulling her silk robe tighter around herself, though the air was gentle. For a moment, they said nothing, listening to the stillness of their own backyard.</span></p><p><span>“You realize,” Agatha murmured at last, tilting her glass toward the water, “this is the first pool I’ve been near where someone hasn’t tried to throw me into it.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s mouth curved. “Give it time.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nudged her knee against Rio’s. “Don’t you dare. These candles make me far too mysterious and beautiful to ruin.”</span></p><p><span>Rio huffed a laugh, low and quiet, then sobered, her eyes on the faint trail of moonlight across the water. “Feels strange, doesn’t it? To sit like this. No teams on watch. No alarms. Just…” She gestured at the pool, the candles, the night. “Us.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha studied her in the glow, all sharp edges softened by the light. “Strange,” she agreed. “And perfect.”</span></p><p><span>For a long breath, Rio didn’t answer, just leaned into the silence. When she did, her voice was steady but low. “I keep thinking I’ll wake up, and that this, ”she gestured again, helpless this time, “was a dream. And I’ll have to start the fight all over.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha set her glass down and reached for her hand. “No dreams. No battles. Just us, in a house with too many bathrooms and a pool I plan to scandalize the neighbors with.”</span></p><p><span>Rio turned, brow arched. “Scandalize?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked, her thumb brushing along Rio’s knuckles. “Skinny-dipping, of course. Don’t look at me like that, you knew what you were signing up for.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shook her head, but her smile was soft, pulled from some place deep. She lifted Agatha’s hand and pressed a kiss into the back of it. “You make even the scars feel worth it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s throat tightened. She leaned in, resting her forehead against Rio’s. The candles flickered around them, the pool lapping gently against its edge. “Then promise me,” she whispered. “No more knives, no more bullets. Just life. With me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s answer was simple, a vow sealed in the still air. “Always.”</span></p><p><span>They kissed, unhurried, the kind that carried no fear of being interrupted. When they finally broke apart, Agatha glanced up at the sky, stars scattered like embers across velvet. For a fleeting moment, her voice softened into something almost prayerful. “For Billy. For all the light he left behind.”</span></p><p><span>Rio followed her gaze, squeezing her hand gently. “He’d like this. Us. Here. Peace.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked hard, then smiled through it. “Then we’ll keep it. For him. For us.”</span></p><p><span>She tugged Rio toward the water, laughter slipping out like a balm, and together they stepped into the shimmering glow. Behind them, the candles burned steadily, as if holding the night in place just for them.</span></p><p><span>The scars, the grief, the battles, all of it had led them here, poolside in the quiet glow, where loss had become memory, and love had become home.</span></p>
