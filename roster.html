<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>When Agatha woke up, she knew she had fucked up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead of being safely tucked away in her own bed, she was waking up in a stranger’s. With a heavy blink, she glanced over her shoulder. A very pretty stranger, but a stranger nonetheless. Agatha wasn’t even sure she remembered her name. All she could recall was nails scratching down her back and a head between her thighs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Carefully shifting onto her back, Agatha took in her surroundings. A small bedroom, decorated with velvet, crystals, and stars. Agatha wrinkled her nose. She needed to get out here immediately. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t like her to sleep over, but Agatha remembered the mix of exhaustion and alcohol lulling her to sleep not long after her orgasm. A rookie mistake on her part, but it wouldn’t be the first time Agatha had to sneak out without waking up whoever’s bed she’s fallen into the night before. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly and methodically, Agatha located her jeans and t-shirt and put them on, not bothering with her underwear or bra. The sooner she got out of here the better, and after this, she was going straight home anyways. Even with the dull pounding in her head from her hangover, she made quick work of it all. Once she was dressed, Agatha pocketed her phone and wallet, found her keys, and left without another look back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Normally, Agatha just snuck out once her partner fell asleep, but this worked too. As long as she got out without the awkward exchange of “this was so nice” and “we should do this again” and “let me have your number,” Agatha considered it a successful encounter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was still early, barely seven, as Agatha kept her head low and walked across the apartment complex. However, when Agatha got to the gate, she realized the flaw in her plan to get out without talking to another soul. There wasn’t a door for Agatha to walk through, and the gate for cars only opened if you had the code or the button, neither of which Agatha had. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck me,” Agatha growled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This meant Agatha had two options. Go back and wake up her bedfellow to get the code or find another way out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So, of course, Agatha was going to find another way out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After pacing back and forth in front of the gate and fence, Agatha came to the frustrating conclusion that there was no way out unless she did something drastic like hop a fence. She squinted at the wrought iron, about a foot or so taller than herself. It could be worse, she reasoned. There were also enough bars going across that she could get enough of a foothold to jump over it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was possibly the stupidest thing she’d done, maybe even stupider than trying to fuck twins back to back at the same party without the other finding out, but Agatha refused to go back to that apartment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Taking a deep breath, Agatha grabbed the bars and shook them experimentally. They barely moved. Sturdy enough to hold her weight then. Agatha stretched onto her toes and wrapped her hands around the highest point. With a grunt, she placed her foot on one of the lower bars and pushed herself up. She scrambled for a moment, but she managed to catch the top of the fence. Agatha scrunched up her face with effort and heaved herself up, but just as she was going to throw herself over the fence, her hand slipped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could even react, Agatha hit the ground, ankle first, then sprawled across the grass. She stayed still for a moment, focusing on her quick breaths and the new pain radiating from her left leg. God, she should’ve just waited for someone to leave. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled onto her back, expecting to see the early morning sky taunting her. Instead, she saw a woman staring down at her in bemusement. Agatha inhaled sharply, preparing to scream, only for the woman to immediately move out of view. With a wince, Agatha sat up to see where she went and, more importantly, who the hell she was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a woman, maybe a few years younger than her, in an oversized t-shirt and plaid pajama pants. She blinked at Agatha from behind a pair of glasses with a bulging trash bag in her hand. She said nothing, staring at Agatha like she was a roadside amusement. To Agatha’s annoyance and interest, she was also very pretty. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I help you?” Agatha said, trying to keep her voice even. She was only somewhat successful, her annoyance seeping in anyways. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman blinked at her and replied, “I’m pretty sure I’m the one who should be asking you that. That fall looked pretty bad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face reddened when she realized this woman must have seen the whole thing. “I’m fine,” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah?” The woman studied her for a moment, eyes going to her ankle, before leaping back up to her face. “Stand up then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t I get a name before you start bossing me around?” Agatha asked, trading her frustration for flirtation. It was easier to handle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>To her satisfaction, the woman smiled briefly before she schooled her expression again. Agatha saw it though, along with the way the tips of her ears went pink. She shifted her weight before she reluctantly said, “Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pleasure to meet you, Rio. I’m Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted and nodded at her rapidly swelling ankle. “A pleasure, really?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You, yes,” Agatha said as she maneuvered onto her knees. “The circumstances, not so much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And what circumstances were what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s just say I had some fun last night but didn’t really want to stick around for the pleasantries,” Agatha said. She glanced at Rio’s face as she said this, but there wasn’t a trace of judgement, only amusement. Agatha looked back down and huffed a little, trying to figure out how to stand up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally taking pity on her, Rio set her trash on the ground and stepped forward. With more strength than Agatha expected, she grabbed her hands and helped pull her to her feet. Agatha stumbled a little, but Rio caught her around her waist. Her hands were warm and solid through Agatha’s thin shirt. Neither of them pulled away immediately, and this close, Agatha could appreciate just how attractive Rio, pink lips and big, brown eyes framed by dark lashes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You couldn’t just do a normal walk of shame like everyone else?” Rio smirked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Blame your stupid gate,” Agatha replied. She tried to put some weight onto her ankle, only to hiss and shift entirely onto her right. Oh, that hurt like a motherfucker. Did she really land on it that badly?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your ankle looks pretty bad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, I wasn’t aware,” Agatha gritted out. She tried rotating it, but it hurt too much. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed and looked back at her trash. She scratched her head then said, “Wait here. I’ll get my car.” At Agatha’s incredulous look, Rio explained, “To take you to the ER.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you wanted to play doctor, all you had to do was ask,” Agatha teased, letting her voice dip into its lower register.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t phased this time though. She just laughed and shook her head. “I just watched you try to jump a fence to avoid saying bye to your one night stand, and you think now is the time to hit on me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No time like the present, right?” Agatha smiled innocently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes. “Just stay here.”</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>. . .</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio came back out with her keys, she had changed out of her pajama pants and into sweatpants. That was the only real difference. She still looked like she just rolled out of bed. Then again, Agatha was sure she didn’t look any better. </span>
</p><p>
<span>During the drive to the hospital, Agatha fidgeted with the radio. At first it was to avoid sitting in silence, but after she changed the station twice, it was to irritate Rio, who twitched every time Agatha switched the song. After Agatha did it for the sixth time within five minutes, Rio clamped her hand around her wrist and said, “Stop or I’ll leave you on the side of the road.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“After going out of your way to get your car to drive me to the hospital?” Agatha pouted. When Rio scoffed, she reached out and laid her hand on Rio’s arm. She stroked her bare skin with her thumb as she said, “You’re sweet, by the way. To do this for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed, but just like before, Agatha could see the way her ears reddened. What an adorable tell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just leave the radio alone,” Rio mumbled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally got to the hospital, Agatha thought Rio would just drop her off, but to her surprise, she stayed with her in the waiting room. Even with her injury, Agatha started getting antsy after ten minutes. She was never very good at sitting still, especially when she had nothing to do. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio eyed her for a moment before she asked, “So, who are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who am I?” Agatha repeated, amused. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio shrugged. “We’re stuck here for who knows how long, so I might as well get to know the crazy lady I drove here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes at how she was described, but with nothing better to do, she started to talk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the next half hour, Agatha and Rio went over the basics with each other. Agatha was twenty-eight, worked at an office, and currently single. Rio was twenty-five, enrolled in medical school, and also currently single. When Agatha heard about Rio’s schooling, she couldn’t help playfully leer at her and say, “So, we really can play doctor?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had just chuckled and nodded at her ankle, saying, “Oh, I don’t think you’re going to be doing anything anytime soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s plenty you can do like this,” Agatha argued. “Or are you just that unimaginative?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I just assumed you’d want a more proactive role,” Rio replied without missing a beat. When Agatha didn’t have a quip ready, Rio’s smile widened. “That’s what I thought.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she was finally called in, Rio held her arm out for her to lean on, and Agatha couldn’t help but smile at the chivalrous gesture. They were led to a bed in the corner by an older nurse who looked at them with a raised brow but said nothing other than, “Those jeans look uncomfortable with your ankle. Do you want some scrub pants?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’d be great, thanks,” Agatha nodded. When the nurse returned with the scrubs, she let them know the doctor would be by soon and left again. Agatha went to undo the button on her jeans, only to remember what she’d done this morning. Blushing, Agatha turned to Rio and said, “I need you to leave and shut the curtain on your way out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aren’t you going to need help?” Rio asked, waving a hand at her ankle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Probably, but I’ll make do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not wearing underwear,” Agatha blurted out. She felt her face flush even more than before at the confession, but she knew Rio wouldn’t leave without a good reason. She probably could have come up with a lie, but there was no point in hiding the fact. It wasn’t like Rio didn’t know what she’d been up to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her with wide eyes before saying, “I’m sorry?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was in a rush this morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I’m sure,” Rio snorted. She leaned in and said in a sly tone, “You know, you spend all morning trying to get in my pants, only to send me away for this. What am I supposed to do with these mixed signals?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just get out,” Agatha hissed, hitting her arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio refrained from any more teasing as she stepped away from the bed and tugged the curtain closed behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Rio suspected, it was difficult to change with a fucked up ankle, but it was doable. When Agatha was done, Rio stepped back in along with the doctor. It was a blur after that, complete with x-rays, lectures, and a prescription. Agatha was exhausted by the end of it, hangover and lack of sleep finally catching up to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was so tired that she actually couldn’t even bring herself to annoy Rio as she called her an Uber. She just sat slumped in the waiting room, staring dully at her new brace. The good news was that she hadn’t broken her ankle. The bad news was that it was so horribly sprained that it was turning black. Well, at least she could play the invalid card. Women loved to dote and nurse someone back to health.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your car should be here in five minutes,” Rio informed her. She plopped into the chair next to her. Agatha couldn’t imagine Rio tenderly caring for her though. The thought made her frown. Not because Rio wouldn’t do it, but because she actually cared if she would. Rio was hot, but that didn’t mean anything. Agatha could have any other hot woman. These thoughts were running through her head when Rio held her hand out and added, “Plenty of time for me to give you my number.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, finally succumbed to my charms?” Agatha asked with a smirk. Maybe she was getting lucky after all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted, “More like my guilty conscience wants to make sure you don’t end up needing an amputation.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” Agatha drawled. She doubted that was it, but she wasn’t going to push. She didn't think too hard about why not. Agatha handed over her phone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When her Uber arrived, Rio walked her out to the car, and it was with a wink that she said, “See you around, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the car door shut, Agatha didn’t blush. Not at all. And when she checked to make sure she had Rio’s number, she hardly smiled at all.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>. . . </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha waited a few days before she texted Rio, and when she did, it was a photo of her ankle propped up on her coffee table. It still looked pretty gross, but it was no longer a concerning black. It was more of a mottled dark purple now. With the photo, Agatha wrote, </span>
<em>
<span>Still alive. I don’t think I’ll need an amputation after all, Dr. Vidal.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio replied a few minutes later with only, </span>
<em>
<span>Not a doctor. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled. </span>
<em>
<span>Close enough. </span>
</em>
<span>She bit her lip as she sent another text. </span>
<em>
<span>For some reason, my pharmacy didn’t fill my prescription, but when I called, the doctor said I can just take like 6 ibuprofen. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>… Are you sure she said that?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Yeah, so I took like four extra strength ibuprofen today.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>AGATHA. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The texts went on like that for the next two weeks. They were never consistent, especially with each of their schedules, but every couple of days they’d have a conversation. It was never anything serious, mostly Agatha complaining about her ankle or Rio sharing the horrors of being a medical student, but it was fun. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As much as she hated to admit it, it was also nice to just talk to someone without the explicit intention of sleeping with her. Agatha didn’t exactly hold thoughtful or even casual conversations with the women she slept with. There was usually hardly any talking at all, and Agatha preferred it that way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So why did she like talking to Rio so much?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, unsure of whether she actually wanted an answer to that. It felt like an inevitable conclusion if they kept talking though, so the obvious answer was that she would just stop texting Rio. Problem solved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And if she sometimes still picked up her phone to text her, only to realize she shouldn't, well, that wasn't anyone's fucking business.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>. . . </span>
</p><p>
<span>Almost a month later, Agatha’s ankle was still sore and sensitive, but she was walking without a noticeable limp. That was good enough for her to go out and find someone for the night. Between work and the injury, she hadn’t been with someone since she sprained her ankle, and Agatha was eager to have some fun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha decided to go to a bar downtown, dressed in slacks and button-down. She made sure to do enough buttons undone to tease and wore her simple gold chain with the outfit. Simple but effective, Agatha felt eyes on her from the moment she walked in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t take long for a woman to join her at the bar. She had long, brown hair and legs that went on for days. By drink number two, she was practically in Agatha’s lap, giggling against her neck while Agatha’s hand rested just above her ass. Agatha was trying to decide if she could coax her into a quick fuck in the restroom when the door to the bar swung open. A few people entered, but it was the last that caught her eye. It was Rio who walked in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze, but Rio didn’t even notice her. She was in a low-cut, black jumpsuit that made Agatha lick her lips. Even as the woman she’d been flirting with leaned against her and whispered something in her ear, Agatha was too busy watching Rio walk up to the other end of the bar and order a drink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without hesitation, Agatha made her choice. She pushed the woman gently and said, “Sorry, my friend just showed up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman blinked at her, confused. “Your friend?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t mention her because I thought she was going to bail on me,” Agatha lied. She kissed the woman’s cheek and held out her phone. “Maybe we can raincheck?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once she got the woman’s phone number, Agatha strode confidently across the bar and slid onto the empty stool beside Rio. “Fancy meeting you here,” Agatha purred.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked and glanced at her, subtly checking her out. “Get bored?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bored of what?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded at the woman Agatha had just abandoned. “Her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, her,” Agatha laughed awkwardly. She leaned against the countertop and stared at her drink for a moment. “I didn’t realize you saw that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm, you’re kind of hard to miss,” Rio said, taking a sip of her drink. Whiskey, by the look of it. “So, what was wrong with her?” Agatha struggled to come up with a lie, so she just shrugged. Rio eyed her for a moment. She didn’t call her on it though. Instead, she gently nudged her ankle with her foot and said, “Looks like you’re good as new.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Practically,” Agatha agreed. “It still hurts if I’ve been walking a lot, but I definitely won’t be hopping a fence any time soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Unsuccessfully hopping a fence,” Rio corrected her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pouted and argued, “I could have made it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That fall I witnessed says otherwise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was how Agatha found herself bickering with Rio for the next half hour over whether they would be able to jump the fence surrounding Rio’s apartment complex. It got so heated that Rio even pulled up a photo of it she had on her phone for some reason. In the end though, they couldn’t agree, both believing they could get over the fence but not the other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why don’t we go check out the fence right now?” Agatha suggested, but she lowered her voice, adding a lilt to it to make it clear she wasn’t talking about the fence at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Watching you fail is not the foreplay you think it is,” Rio laughed, and although Agatha blushed at the way she phrased it, she was pleased that Rio hadn’t outright said no. She turned to face Agatha more fully and hooked her finger into the opening of Agatha’s shirt. She tugged on it playfully as she asked, “Tell me, Agatha. Why did you come up to me tonight?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It took Agatha a moment to answer, distracted by Rio’s touch. “What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean, you had a woman ready to leave with you when I walked in, but you didn’t take her,” Rio explained. “There are also at least three other women in this bar you could have gone and flirted with, but you didn’t. Instead, you came up to me, who watched you eat shit while trying to hop a fence and drove you to the hospital.” Her hand curled into the fabric and pulled her closer, just enough that Agatha could feel Rio’s breath warm against her cheeks. “After you stopped texting too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Noticed that, did you?” Agatha let out a nervous laugh. Normally, she never spoke to someone again after she stopped returning their texts. She wasn’t sure what to say in this predicament. Agatha bit her lip, meeting Rio’s piercing gaze. She took a deep breath. “What if I told you I don’t know? I have no idea why." She shrugged helplessly, eyes darting away as the honest words left her. "I saw you, and I had to talk to you. Not much more thinking took place than that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her. “Really? That’s it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What else is there to say?” Agatha replied, cheeks reddening. “I missed talking to you, so what? You’re hot and you’re funny and you’re smart and you aren't afraid to argue with me and…” She trailed off, realizing this wasn’t just physical after she kept going after hot. Instead of focusing on Rio's lips or legs or ass, Agatha had listed pretty much everything else. Her eyebrows furrowed, mouth falling open. “Oh my god,” Agatha gasped. “Do I actually like you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” Rio said, not even trying to hide her laughter. “Do you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck?” Agatha groaned, burying her face in her hands. Only for a moment though. Then, she looked up and punched Rio in the arm. She didn’t even feel guilty when Rio hissed and rubbed the spot. “What the hell did you do? I don’t like people!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess I’m just so irresistible,” Rio teased. “Apparently so much so that even a womanizer like you can’t help yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wanted to hit her again, but she also wanted to kiss her. One option was obviously better than the other though, so after a firm glare, Agatha grabbed Rio’s face and kissed her. Rio made a noise of surprise before she melted into it, holding her wrists and kissing her back just as eagerly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they parted, Agatha rested her forehead against Rio’s and sighed. “You’re going to ruin my reputation, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed and kissed her again. “You already ruined that yourself. Now, do you want to get out of here?” When Agatha nodded and made to get up, Rio stopped her with a hand on her chest. “But we can only do this if you promise not to try to jump any fences.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you kidding?” Agatha scoffed. “There won't be any fences, period. We’re going to mine.” Tossing a handful of cash onto the counter, Agatha grabbed Rio’s hand and pulled her out of the bar, her laughter following after them as they hailed a cab.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ended up being the first woman Agatha brought to her home, and when Agatha woke up the next morning with Rio curled around her, face pressed against her neck, Agatha couldn't help but think that she could get used to this.</span>
