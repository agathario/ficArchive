<h2 class="toc-heading">green is the colour of her kind</h2>
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha is cute. </p><p>Agatha’s cute when she’s all pouty, especially when she’s perched on Rio’s lap like she belongs there. And she does. She really, really does. </p><p>“Why didn’t you come over last night?” Her eyes are so blue, looking at Rio with a softness that Rio suspects Agatha isn’t even aware of. “You didn’t even text me back.” </p><p>And despite how cute, how <em> soft</em>, how gentle, Agatha is being, Rio has a plan. A very good plan, in her opinion. Because Rio is a jealous person by nature, she’s constantly glaring daggers at women (and, <em> shudderingly</em>, some men) who think they have a chance with Agatha. And Agatha always turns them down, but that’s not the problem.</p><p>The problem is that Agatha enjoys Rio’s possessive streak and will sometimes egg it on. </p><p>Not that Rio ever stops her. She enjoys it herself, she thinks, because she doesn’t believe there’s a real threat of somebody swooping in and stealing Agatha out right from under her. She loves how pliant Agatha will go under Rio’s hands when they get mean, when they tease her to the brink of breaking, when Rio will pull away and make Agatha confirm that she’s Rio’s and only Rio’s. </p><p>But nevertheless.</p><p>“I had a date,” Rio lies. It burns her throat as it comes out, like bile, because Rio’s always hated lying, but she thinks it’ll be worth it. </p><p>Agatha’s pout disappears, being replaced by an actual frown. Her eyebrows crease in a way that’s equally as adorable, though. It spurs her on, because she clearly has Agatha’s attention and Agatha clearly isn’t calling Rio’s bluff even though, in her opinion, she’s an awful liar. </p><p>“What?” </p><p>“I had a date,” Rio repeats. It burns just as much the second time. “She stayed the night. I didn’t think it would be appropriate to text you, so I waited until she left.” </p><p>Those pretty blue eyes turn cold so quickly that it almost gives Rio whiplash. Agatha pushes herself off of Rio and stands up straight, almost rigid.</p><p>“Hey, come back,” Rio whines. She grabs for Agatha who just puts more distance between them, and it’s then that Rio thinks maybe she fucked up. Rio’s used to Agatha’s playful anger, pretending to be mad when she’s really not, and this is not that. </p><p>“Fuck you, Rio,” Agatha says. Her voice is low. It doesn’t shake despite there being clear unshed tears in her eyes. She heads toward the door and Rio feels that plummeting feeling in her stomach. </p><p>Shit, shit, shit. </p><p>“Wait, Agatha—” She reaches out for her again and Agatha slaps her hand away. </p><p>“Fuck you,” Agatha says again. “In case it’s not obvious to you, we’re done. I’ll get Billy to come by and grab my shit that’s here.” The sadness that was so palpable moments ago is replaced by white hot anger and it rolls off of Agatha in waves. </p><p>Yeah, okay, yeah, Rio fucked up. “Agatha, please let me—” </p><p>“No,” Agatha barks. “Don’t talk to me. Don’t touch me. Don’t come near me.” She’s so close to the front door, and Rio is starting to panic. When Agatha slips out the door, Rio feels the weight of everything that had just happened crash down on her and her knees buckle. </p><p>She just stays crumpled on the floor beside the couch, her apartment eerily quiet and the air smelling like Agatha’s perfume. </p><hr/><p>“Okay, so, tell me what happened,” Wade says.</p><p>Rio’s face is in her hands. “I tried to make Agatha jealous and instead of the sexy jealousy that might lead to her fucking me face first into the couch, she actually got upset and left.” She digs the heels of her hands into her eyes until she sees bright white. </p><p>“Were you guys exclusive?” </p><p>Rio sighs. “We never talked about it but whenever Agatha gets hit on she always tells them she’s not available.” </p><p>Wade groans. “<em>Rio</em>. She is telling you she’s yours and you decided, to, what—”</p><p>“—I told her I had a date and hooked up with someone else,” Rio finishes. She finally looks at Wade, who is looking at her like she’s stupid. She is. She knows. “I know. Look, <em> I know</em>, okay? I didn’t think she’d get this worked up over it.” </p><p>“You didn’t think the girl who tells other people she’s not single that she wouldn’t be upset hearing that the girl she thought she was dating hooked up with somebody else?” </p><p>Well, when he says it like that… </p><p>“You’re so stupid,” Wade tells her. Matter of fact.</p><p>“I know,” Rio mutters. “I fucked up and now she’s <em> actually </em> mad at me for something I didn’t <em> actually </em> do, and I don’t know what to do about it.”</p><p>“Did you try to apologize?”</p><p>Rio stares at him for a moment. “Did I try to apologize? No, Wade, I feel like this because I <em> haven’t </em> tried to apologize to her. I’m wallowing because she’s <em> not </em>ignoring me.” </p><p>“Hey, keep it cute, Vidal. This is your own fault. If you don’t want help…”</p><p>Rio sighs. “Would Vanessa ever forgive you?”</p><p>“She’d literally cut my balls off if I even thought of looking at another woman, much less if I lied to her and told her I fucked one. What do you think.” Rio thought Agatha would be similar, but would play the game. That she’d prove that Rio is hers, not just give up and walk away. When she says this out loud Wade actually smacks her upside the head. “Are you stupid?” </p><p>“Yes, Wade, we’ve already established this.” </p><p>“Why should <em> she </em> have to prove anything to you? She has already whenever she tells people she’s taken. If anyone has anything to prove, lady, it’s you.” </p><p>And, fuck, Wade is right. </p><p>“I really didn’t think she’d react that way,” Rio mutters. </p><p>“Doesn’t she, like, have a really bad relationship with her mom?” Rio nods slowly, trying to figure out where Wade is going with this. And then it dawns on her. Fuck, she really is the stupidest person alive. Wade snorts when it’s obvious the lightbulb lights up in Rio’s brain. “You literally made a girl who probably already has a traumatizing history with not feeling good enough feel like she’s actually not good enough.” </p><p><em> Fuck</em>. </p><p>“I don’t know about you but I’d start groveling. She doesn’t seem like the type to forgive and forget easily and she definitely doesn’t seem like she’ll be waiting around for you to come crawling back.”</p><p>She’s not. Rio knows she’s not, even finds that one of the most endearing things about Agatha. Her mean streak has always been one of the foundational reasons Rio is so attracted to her. </p><p>“Good luck.” Wade pats her on the top of the head. “You’re gonna need it.”</p><hr/><p>“She’s not home.” </p><p>Rio stares at Jen, Agatha’s roommate. She can’t tell if Jen is lying or not to protect Agatha, but then she remembers that Agatha and Jen don’t really like each other. And then she remembers further that Agatha and Jen have hooked up before and she scowls.</p><p>“Where is she, then?” </p><p>Jen leans against the doorframe nonchalantly, looking down at her nailbeds like they’re so much more interesting than Rio. “She’s on a date with that redhead.” </p><p>Redhead… </p><p>“Which redhead?” </p><p>Jen sighs and drops her hand down to her side, levelling Rio with a glare. “I don’t <em> know</em>, the one with the accent and the big eyes.”</p><p>Fucking Wanda Maximoff? </p><p>“She’s on a date with Wanda Maximoff?” Rio growls.</p><p>“Yep.” The ‘p’ pops. There’s a slight smirk on Jen’s face, which tells Rio that obviously Agatha had told Jen about what happened between them and that’s probably why Jen is being so frigid. “You fucked up that one, huh?” </p><p>“I’m aware,” Rio muttered, turning to walk off. </p><p>Before she could get far, however, Jen snags her by the wrist. “Agatha’s a raging cunt but I’ve known her for my entire life. You hurt her really badly.” Rio will never understand their friendship, she thinks. “I’ve never seen her this upset over a girl before. Why would you cheat on her?” </p><p>“I <em> didn’t</em>,” Rio insists.</p><p>Jen drops her wrist and rolls her eyes. “Oh, please. You think that just because you didn’t sit down and call each other girlfriends that you <em> weren’t</em>?” </p><p>“No, that’s not what I mean.” Jen stares at her expectantly. “I was trying to make her jealous.” </p><p>Rio watches Jen’s face go through a couple different emotions before she settles on judgment. “You were trying to make her jealous? Agatha Harkness? And you didn’t think that would go spectacularly badly?” </p><p>“I didn’t think she’d be so upset.” When Jen opens her mouth to speak again, Rio snaps, “I know. I fucked up. I was thinking about the sex we’d have, because when I get possessive, we have great sex. I wasn’t thinking that she’d actually internalize it.” </p><p>“She never allowed herself to feel less than,” Jen tells her. “Ever. After she got out from under Evanora’s thumb, she never wanted to feel like that ever again. She’s probably not going to take you back. She’s probably already killed you several times in her mind, honestly.” </p><p>Rio bites the inside of her cheek. She knows there’s a high chance Agatha might not forgive her but she needs Agatha to know that it was Rio being stupid that caused this, not that Agatha did anything wrong. </p><p>“I just don’t want her to think I never thought she was good enough. Even if she doesn’t forgive me, she deserves to know.” </p><p>Jen’s face shifts. It’s quick and if Rio wasn’t watching for it, she might’ve missed it, but she sees something that might look like respect. </p><p>“They’re at The Witches Road.” </p><p>“She brought the girl that always made <em> me </em>insanely jealous to my favourite bar?” Rio is incredulous. And then it hits her. Agatha is getting her back. Agatha is still mad enough at Rio that her decision to go out with Wanda, to go to Rio’s favourite bar with her. </p><p>And anger is better than apathy. </p><p>“Thanks, Jen.”</p><p>Jen doesn’t reply to her, just closes the door in Rio’s face. But it’s fine. Because Rio all but sprints to the other side of campus, where The Witches Road is purple and green lit, lively and bustling. </p><p>She takes a moment outside to take a couple of deep breaths, getting her heart rate under control. She doesn’t know what she’s going to say, exactly, she just knows that she needs to tell Agatha the truth and to get her away from that Maximoff bitch.</p><p>Once she’s inside, it doesn’t take long for Rio’s eyes to settle on Agatha. She’s in their favourite booth after all, but Wanda is there, too. They’re leaning in close to each other, noses almost brushing, and Rio feels white hot jealousy coil in her gut. </p><p>She storms over and slams her hand down on the table. Hard enough for her hand to sting, hard enough for Wanda to startle. Agatha, though, just stares at her with withdrawn eyes. Like she’s almost bored. Rio and Agatha just stare at each other for a few moments, neither of them moving or talking. </p><p>Agatha breaks the silence first. “What do you want, Rio?” </p><p>“I need to talk to you.” </p><p>“I’m a little busy right now.” She gestures to Wanda, who is just staring at Rio with an inscrutable look in her eyes. “And I told you that I didn’t want you near me. So why are you here?” </p><p>“I need to talk to you,” Rio says again, more insistently this time. Rio drags her eyes from Agatha back to Wanda. Her lip curls. “Alone.” </p><p>Agatha picks up her drink, takes a sip, biting down on the straw while looking at Rio like she wants to pounce, and Rio isn’t quite sure in which way. “I’m busy. Go away.” </p><p>“No,” Rio grits out. “Agatha, I’m not leaving before I talk to you.” </p><p>“Look,” Wanda says, breaking the tension. “I’m going to go to the bathroom and freshen up. There’s probably a line. I’ll be back, you two can talk. There’s clearly some unresolved issues you guys need to sort out before we leave.” </p><p>Rio has to swallow back her anger at the insinuation that Agatha and Wanda will be leaving together, and she has to quite literally hold herself back from throttling Wanda when Agatha leans over to kiss Wanda on the cheek. </p><p>Wanda keeps her eyes on Rio the entire time she slides out of the booth and with a simple quirk of her eyebrow, she abruptly turns and heads toward the bathroom. Leaving Rio and Agatha alone. </p><p>“Well? What do you want? It’s extremely rude that you interrupted my date after what you did.” </p><p>Rio slides into the booth so she can talk to Agatha properly, be on the same level as her. Not be above her when she apologizes to her. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breaths out. “I didn’t—” No, not the right way to start. “I am <em> so sorry</em>.” Better. “When I told you that I hooked up with somebody else, I was lying. I didn’t touch someone else, there was nobody else. I was just trying to make you jealous.” </p><p>Agatha’s eyes are still cold, her jaw clenched. It looks like her anger is renewed. </p><p>“I know that doesn’t make it any better,” Rio is quick to add on. “I know that what I did is still fucked up. I was just… I don’t know. We have fun when you play with my possessive streak. I was hoping it would be similar. I didn’t think I would actually hurt you and that wasn’t what I meant to do.” </p><p>Rio watches as Agatha swallows and opens her mouth to speak, but then she closes her mouth again. She’s at a loss for words and the anger is still there but it’s being overshadowed by sadness now. </p><p>“I’m not telling you this so you’ll take me back,” Rio says. And, well, it’s kind of the truth. Rio does want Agatha back but after talking to Jen and Wade, she decided that she needed to tell Agatha this so she wouldn’t be hurting anymore. Not just for Rio’s sake. “I’m telling you so you don’t feel like I ever looked elsewhere when we were together. I never did. I never wanted to. You are all I wanted. I’m just a fucking idiot who wanted to make you jealous and didn’t think about how you might perceive that.” </p><p>Agatha looks at her, her eyes intense. Inscrutable. Rio can’t tell what she’s thinking from the expression on her face, can’t read her, and Rio hates that.</p><p>And the universe must hate Rio, truly, because just as Rio opens her mouth to respond, Wanda comes back. She sidles up to Agatha on the other side of the booth, blinking owlishly at Rio. </p><p>“Everything okay?” Wanda asks. </p><p>Agatha clears her throat. “Yeah,” she says, her gaze hard. “Let’s get out of here.” It takes a moment for the words to register to Rio, and it took a second longer for her to realize she wasn’t speaking to her. She was speaking to Wanda. She was getting out of the booth and leaving. With Wanda. </p><p>Fuck. </p><hr/><p>Rio is drowning her sorrows in mint chocolate chip ice cream. She knows this. Agatha always hated mint chocolate chip ice cream, so she never kept it in her apartment, but now that Agatha is off fucking Wanda into oblivion, Rio thinks she deserves a treat to mend her broken heart.</p><p>A broken heart she herself is the cause of, but still broken-hearted nonetheless. Just as she’s going in for her twentieth spoonful, the tub leaving an imprint on her shirt, she hears a knock on the door. It’s probably Wade, or Alice, or—</p><p>It’s Agatha. Rio’s mouth drops open and she’s distantly aware that she probably has crusted ice cream on her face and her shirt is crumpled, that she’s standing in front of Agatha, her dream woman, the woman she is completely fucked for, looking a total mess. </p><p>“Can I come in?” </p><p>Rio shuffles aside, her legs moving before her brain even sends the proper signals. The door snicks shut behind her as she orbits around Agatha, trying to avoid being sucked in closer. </p><p>“What are you doing here? I thought you went home with Wanda.” </p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer, moving to shrug off her jacket. She’s still wearing the clothes she’d had on from her date, Rio notices, and now she can see the entire outfit clearly. She’s wearing a purple dress that lands just above the knees, legs bare, cleavage on full display. She was going in for the kill tonight, and Rio finds herself stewing in jealousy. Wanda got to have Agatha all dressed up like this. </p><p>Rio’s eyes linger on Agatha’s calves before noticing the shoes. She’d forgone her usual heels in favour of a pair of flats. </p><p>“My feet hurt. I changed them in the car,” Agatha tells her, almost like she can read Rio’s mind. And honestly? Rio thinks she probably can. She’s always been freakishly in tune with Rio’s thoughts. </p><p>“You left.” Agatha looks at her, tilts her head. Rio continues, “with Wanda. You left. What are you doing here?” </p><p>Agatha walks closer to her, gets into her space. She smells good—with her usual perfume, something herbal, and the drink she was sipping on at the bar. “I went to Wanda’s,” she agrees. “Not that you deserve to know, but nothing happened. I just needed time to think after you dropped that bombshell on me.” Her hands, her beautiful, destructive hands, cup Rio’s face. “You really hurt me.”</p><p>Rio’s vision swims and she blinks them back. She shouldn’t be the one crying right now, this is <em> her fault</em>. “I know,” she whispers. “I know I hurt you. I’m sorry.” </p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath, leans in until their noses nudge. She doesn’t speak again, and Rio doesn’t expect her too. But she also doesn’t expect Agatha to kiss her either, but <em> she does</em>. She does and Rio’s heart feels like it’s about to beat out of her chest. It’s been so long (it hasn’t been that long, but it <em> felt long</em>) since she’s felt Agatha’s lips on hers and she never wants to go without it again. </p><p>It’s hungry, Agatha swallowing all the noises Rio makes and pushing her in ways that makes her make more. By time Agatha pulls back, Rio is shaking. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio says, and her voice is thick. She sounds wrecked and Agatha hasn’t even touched her yet. She’d feel shame, she’d feel embarrassed, if she wasn’t able to see Agatha’s eyes dilate at the sound of her voice. “Agatha, please.” </p><p>Then she’s tugged into her own bedroom, stripped bare and pushed down onto the bed. She can only watch as Agatha undresses herself. It’s not slow, it’s not showy, but Agatha maintains eye contact the entire time. </p><p>Agatha saunters over to the bed and covers Rio’s body with her own, her kisses harsh and possessive, making Rio feel owned in a way she’s never felt before. Agatha’s shown possessiveness in the past, but this is different.</p><p>And when Agatha bites down into the juncture of Rio’s shoulder, she lets out a sound foreign to her own ears, almost a scream, and her thighs moisten. </p><p>She rears back, mouth open in shock. “I—”</p><p>“Did you just—” Agatha’s eyes are wide, but her smirk is a dead giveaway that she knows exactly what just happened. She just came from being bitten by Agatha. Not touched, not fucked, not even having her nipples sucked. Just by being bitten by her, by feeling owned. </p><p>“Agatha, I—”</p><p>“Fuck, that was so hot, baby,” Agatha groans, and Rio shudders at the praise, at the tone of voice, at the reverence in her voice. </p><p>(Even though Rio doesn’t think she deserves it, she will take it greedily.) </p><p>“Can I please touch you now?” Rio whimpers when Agatha runs her tongue over the bite mark. “Please, Agatha, I need to feel you.” </p><p>“No,” Agatha answers simply. </p><p>Rio goes to whine, goes to complain that she wants to touch Agatha so fucking badly, but when Agatha shifts them so that their legs are tangled together and Agatha’s core is lined up with her own, she lets her head fall back with a moan.</p><p>Okay, she can do this. She can handle this. </p><p>Agatha’s hips undulate, sliding deliciously against Rio’s clit. And then again. And then again. And Rio is so sensitive from her impromptu orgasm, but she holds off until Agatha gets close. When she sees the telltale signs when Agatha is about to come. </p><p>“Fuck, Agatha, please come on my pussy,” Rio groans. “Please, please, <em> fuck</em>.” </p><p>The sound they make moving against each other is almost crude, almost obscenely pornographic, and like a fucking romance novel, they do manage to come together. Rio’s fingers grasp Agatha’s tightly and the sight of Agatha falling apart, her hips twitching and her eyes swallowed by blackness. </p><p>Agatha continues to move, weakly, until she physically tires. But Rio can tell she’s still wound up. </p><p>“Sit on my face.” Agatha looks at her, eyebrows raised. “Please, Agatha. I need to taste you. Please sit on my face. I want to make you come again.” </p><p>“Well, who am I to argue with that,” Agatha purrs with a smirk. She crawls over top Rio and situates herself over her face, her glorious pussy just above Rio’s mouth. Rio pulls her down against her lips, tongue seeking her clit, drinking in Agatha’s release and slick like she might die without it. “Oh, fuck, Rio. Fuck, your mouth. Missed it.”</p><p>Rio moans into Agatha’s wetness and it makes Agatha twitch and bore down harder against her mouth. Rio’s arms wrap solidly around Agatha’s thighs and hold her there, licking at her until Agatha crumbles. </p><p>And Rio? She licks it all up greedily, continuing to flick her tongue against her clit until Agatha pushes her face away. </p><p>“We’re even now,” Agatha says. She’s breathless. “How do you feel about lucky number three for the both of us?” </p><p>Rio’s curious, but when Agatha turns herself so her own face is pressed between Rio’s thighs, she understands. Fuck. </p><p>“Yeah, baby, fuck,” Rio moans. </p><p>Agatha’s tongue is brutal in its ascent to Rio’s clit. Unlike Rio, who is savouring the taste and the feeling of Agatha on her tongue, Agatha is savage. Agatha has a clear goal, which is to make Rio fall apart, and she goes until that happens. </p><p>It’s one of the things Rio loves most about Agatha and sex with Agatha. She brings Rio so much pleasure but she doesn't do it for Rio’s benefit. She does it because <em> she wants to</em>, and that’s so deliriously hot. </p><p>“Agatha, I’m close,” Rio manages out. It’s the best she can do with Agatha’s clit in her mouth.</p><p>Agatha moans, the vibrations making Rio’s hips buck up. Agatha’s hands are harsh when they push her down and she takes Rio’s clit between her incisors and <em> bites</em>.</p><p>Rio thinks she may have blacked out when she comes, and she’s distantly aware of the gush of wetness on her own face, which is laps up greedily, but she’s working on autopilot now. </p><p>She feels Agatha get off of her and curl up next to her but it takes a while for her brain to come back online. When she’s able to think again, to see again, she sees Agatha cuddled into Rio’s side like she belongs there. </p><p>And she does.</p><p>Rio tells her so, and she doesn’t even try to ignore the almost painful flutter in her stomach at the sleepy smile Agatha gives her in response. She brings Agatha closer, wrapping her arms around her protectively. Their breaths mingle, and Rio thinks she’s about to nod off before Agatha speaks again. </p><p>“If you hurt me again,” Agatha says after a moment, “we’re done. For real. I don’t give second chances. Don’t make me regret it.” </p><p>“I won’t,” Rio promises. “I know I’m stupid but I’m also ridiculously sorry. And I lo—” Nope, nope! Not right now. “I love what we have. I don’t want to hurt you again. I want to be with you.” </p><p>Agatha doesn’t look back up at her but Rio thinks she can feel her cheeks heat up. </p><p>“Well. Good.” </p><p>So Rio smiles and repeats, “good.”</p>
