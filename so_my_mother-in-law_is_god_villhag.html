<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Death has always been a problem for Eternity.</p><p>It was like this from the very beginning, when the womb of Existence went into a miraculous labor, producing two magnificent children, <em> Infinity, </em> and <em> Eternity, </em>with their cherubic grins and endless optimism, only to birth an unexpected stillborn moments later. One that would ruin the great, easy thing that Life could have been. </p><p>That stillborn was Death.</p><p>Death was different from the very start. Where Eternity and Infinity enjoyed sitting at the edges of the universe, creating stars out of dust, Death moped.</p><p>Death did not see the point in creating life, as it was so very short lived. It depressed her. Stars, she would say, were just furious, angry moments in time, barely alive, barely a blink in existence, just a scream into the dark, before flickering out and once again rejoining oblivion.</p><p>Infinity tried her best to assuage Death. To explain to her that Life never really began or ended, it just cycled.</p><p>She was always the more patient sister.</p><p>Which was ironic, really, given Eternity’s whole reason for being. But Eternity couldn’t help it.</p><p>Death was just so… <em>short-sighted</em>.</p><p>She saw things exclusively in terms of endings. Like a painter who could never enjoy the process of a brush stroke, overly obsessed with the final picture.</p><p>So, selfish as it was, Eternity did not mourn the day that Death vanished. She celebrated with a long drink, even as Infinity anxiously surveyed the universe, peeking under every rock, toppling mountains in search of her sister.</p><p>But Death was nowhere to be found. Things still died, of course—but Death did not claim their souls. The universe became one great purgatory, dust collected. </p><p>This would continue for a small while.</p><p>Until an invitation turned up on Eternity’s doorstep.<br/><br/></p><p>
<em> Hello, You Two Weird Concepts in the Sky, </em>
</p><p>
<em> I’ve never tried to contact a Cosmic Entity before—Death always had an annoying way of finding me, and I’ve tried very hard throughout my life not to look for her—but I figured, these are extenuating circumstances. </em>
</p><p>
<em> My name is Agatha Harkness, and I’m dating your little sister. </em>
</p><p>
<em>  I’m inviting you for dinner on Thursday. My address is 14 Harbor Street in Salem, Massachusetts. I’ll be cooking stew, and Death will be making strawberry tarts for dessert. If you have any sort of dietary restrictions, let me know in advance.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I’d say I hope you come, but I’m actually demanding you do, as the ritual I’m performing in order to send you this is ridiculously expensive, so the least you could do is show up.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> See you then. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>☆ ★</p><p> </p><p>“The audacity,” Eternity said, swirling around the cosmos in the way a woman might pace angrily around her living room. “Of a <em> mortal,</em> of all things, asking us to contort ourselves into a <em> human </em> form.” She tensed, disgusted. “To diminish ourselves! And on top of that to <em> lie </em> about Death’s whereabouts when she has gone missing. So cruel, so inconsiderate, so disgustingly <em> bold.</em> It is too bad Death is not around, or I would ask her to smite this <em> Agatha Harkness.”</em></p><p>“But what if she is not lying?”</p><p>Infinity, <em> always the optimist. </em> Eternity groaned, and the timeline briefly slowed to a halt. Mortals might experience this phenomenon in those moments where they walk through a doorway, and they suddenly forget why they did so. That was just Eternity having a headache.</p><p>“Of course she’s lying,” Eternity replied. “Death would never take a mortal form. She <em> hates </em> mortality. Did you already forget about her issues with the stars? And stars live for so much longer than humans. To think she’d fraternize with something so small—”</p><p>Infinity shrugged. “Maybe this Agatha Harkness changed her mind.”</p><p>“A mortal? Changing Death?”</p><p>“Stranger things have happened.”</p><p>“I’m not sure they have.”</p><p>Infinity began to swim away before Eternity could drone on, heading toward Earth with a bit too much eagerness in her step. “I’m going to go pick out a human body. I want to make sure I have something decent by Thursday. You know, one without too many wrinkles. I suggest you do the same—you know how long shopping for the right suit can take.”</p><p>“You can’t possibly be serious!”</p><p>“Eternity.” Infinity paused. “Death has found herself a girlfriend. A mortal one. Who invited us over for supper. I’m not sure anything this amusing will ever happen to the universe again.”</p><p> </p><p>☆ ★</p><p> </p><p>Naturally, Infinity and Eternity showed up several days early, as they were not accustomed to the human calendar, and could not read a clock. So instead they hid in a bush outside Agatha’s house, and watched as the woman went about her little mortal life.</p><p><em> Little </em> was not a good way to describe it, however. The woman had a presence as large as the sky. She carried herself like a dragon, stomping across the sidewalk as if it was the milky-way.</p><p>Her routine was also anything but ordinary. She woke up at random times, occasionally slept for days, and was often busy in her backyard for hours, drawing strange shapes in the dirt, and yelling into the air when the dirt did not do what she wanted it to.</p><p>“Useless. <em> Useless.</em> I’m getting a refund on this spellbook,” Agatha muttered, kicking the lawn with her heel. She’d been attempting to summon something for hours, but the spell kept giving her… fish, instead. Trout, salmon, cod. Eternity had no idea what the intended object of her summoning was, but the lawn soon smelled like a moldy river. “I should report Jen to the Better Business Bureau.”</p><p>“Is she insane?” Eternity asked Infinity, as they watched from behind a tree. It was strange for Eternity to see her sister this way, embodied as a slim blonde woman, outfitted in denim.</p><p>For her own body, Eternity had chosen an older woman, near the end of her life. She’d found her at a nursing home, babbling about taxes and petting a television screen.</p><p>She’d triggered an alarm when she walked the woman out, which had been a bit exciting, but she’d waddled away before they could come to claim her.</p><p>“Of course she’s insane,” answered Infinity. “Mortals fear nothing more than they fear Death. If one of them has chosen instead to date her, they must have something seriously wrong with them.”</p><p>Eternity found herself laughing.</p><p>It was an unfamiliar feeling, like something uncontrollable and free was bubbling out of her. She quickly stopped the affair, choking it back into her lungs.</p><p>“Enough of this waiting.” She grabbed Infinity by the hand. “I’ve decided it’s Thursday now.”</p><p>The calendar adjusted itself accordingly.</p><p> </p><p>☆ ★</p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness was a terrible host.</p><p>For one, she kept Infinity and Eternity waiting at the door for fifteen entire minutes after they arrived, insisting that <em> the house wasn’t ready yet</em>. Eternity quickly realized this meant that <em> Agatha </em> wasn’t ready yet, as she glanced up to find the dark-haired woman applying mascara in her room through the window.</p><p>She materialized a few minutes later in a robe, her hair lazy around her shoulders, and welcomed them in with a little annoyed flourish of her hand.</p><p>Secondly, once they were allowed to enter the house, they had nowhere to sit. Agatha had pushed all the chairs into the dining room, which was locked and, according to the self-described witch, “not yet available for the public.”</p><p>The living room had a sofa, but there was a rabbit on it. Eternity would have sat next to the rabbit, but when she tried to, it <em> hissed </em> at her. Hissed!</p><p>“I <em> created </em> you,” Eternity hissed back.</p><p>“Technically, no. Mom created the rabbit,” Infinity corrected.</p><p>“Technically, you’re an asshole, this was a terrible idea, and I think we should leave,” Eternity grumbled back. </p><p>The door shuttered open.</p><p>Eternity and Infinity’s heads whipped toward the sound, just in time for them to hear Agatha call out from the kitchen.</p><p>“Rio! You better have got my text about the celery. This stew is going to be garbage without the celery.”</p><p>A woman dressed in combat boots, ripped jeans, a <em> Metallica </em> hoodie and a baseball cap chuckled as she hung her denim jacket on one of the hangers in the foyer.</p><p>“I didn’t know this was a public event,” Eternity grumbled.</p><p>The woman seemed to have the same reaction, because as soon as she caught sight of them, she froze, frowned.</p><p>“Agatha. You didn’t mention… guests?”</p><p>“Oh. Did I not? Huh. Must have slipped my mind.”</p><p>Agatha emerged from the kitchen, hot steam billowing out. She was carrying a pot of soup that smelled suspiciously like the various fish from the yard. She stopped short in the middle of the three of them, and blew out a breath. But she didn’t say anything.</p><p>To fill the silence, Rio stuck out a hand toward Eternity.</p><p>“Hey,” she said. “I’m Rio. And you’re…”</p><p>Eternity felt suddenly awkward. She hadn’t planned to pick a human name. She was already belittling herself as it was.</p><p>Agatha smacked their hands away before she had to choose.</p><p>“Don’t bother,” she said to Rio. “You already know these people.”</p><p>Rio squinted. Infinity’s eyebrows rose, like she’d just realized something. Eternity felt very, very confused.</p><p>“You don’t mean…” Infinity trailed off.</p><p>“Infinity, Eternity,” Agatha said, rolling her eyes as she said their names, like they were silly characters from a children’s book. “This is your sister, Rio. Death. Morticia. End of All Things. Oh, and I’m Agatha. Obviously.” She offered them all a condescending smile. “Great, now that we’re caught up, I’m going to need help in the kitchen. I hope you guys brought tupperware, because there’s enough soup here to feed the heavens for a couple years…”</p><p>All the pieces fell into place. Death glared at the brown-haired woman like the sun might glare at the misbehaving moon.</p><p>“Agatha.” She breathed in sharply. “What. Did. You. <em> Do? </em>”</p>

<p>“Sooo…” Agatha rapped her fingers against the table, trying to break the awkward silence. “My mother-in-law is like, God?”</p><p>Death and Eternity answered at once. “<em>No. </em>”Feeling the strange intimacy that comes with saying the same thing at the same time, Rio looked away, crossing her arms; Eternity did the same, and Infinity sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose.</p><p>Agatha stifled an inappropriate laugh. <em> These </em> were the lofty, godly concepts that created humanity? </p><p>She was starting to have that uncanny sensation that sometimes pops up when you date a girl and then meet her mother. When you sit across from the pair of them at the dining room table and begin to notice these uncomfortable similarities—how they frown the same way, style their hair with the same strange side-part, make the same off-color jokes when they’re feeling uncomfortable.</p><p>She was starting to feel that way about Rio’s family and the human race. The lineage was all quite obvious. It wasn’t really a surprise that humanity ended up so fucked up if <em> this </em> was the blueprint.</p><p>Infinity cleared her throat.</p><p>“I wouldn’t recommend calling her God if you’re over for lunch, but it’s not entirely wrong. Monotheism is just a bit of a contentious topic in our family,” she said calmly, in the tone of a school teacher. “Our mother, Existence, didn’t exactly consciously create anything. The universe was a surprise to her too. Like when you sleepwalk, and wake up with a cookie in your hand. Unlike your many interpretations of God, she didn’t consciously place any rules, or create structures…”</p><p>Agatha gave a disinterested wave of her hand.</p><p>“And do you have a dad?” she cut in, bringing her spoon to her mouth and blowing on it noisily. Rio buried her face in her arms and groaned.</p><p>Infinity snorted. “Has Death seriously not told you any of this?”</p><p>“She’s annoyingly tight-lipped when it comes to you all,” Agatha said. “Hence why I had to invite you over myself.”</p><p>“Tight-lipped for a reason,” Rio grumbled out between her arms.</p><p>Eternity looked down at her soup, watching as the head of a cod bobbed out of the water. It did not look fully cooked. She swore the eye was still blinking.</p><p>“We don’t have a father, no,” Infinity answered politely. “Although gender in the human fashion is not really a… construct to us. Well, in a <em> way </em> it is, I suppose. But you can think of it in the same way in which human languages like Spanish and German have genders attached to objects. <em> El sol. Der Mond</em>. We have the same. It does not mean that our mother is a woman, simply that Existence is a feminine entity. She encompasses everything.”</p><p>“Huh.” Agatha perched her chin on her hand, blinking in genuine curiosity. “I see you’re the smart sister.”</p><p>Rio elbowed her in the ribs. Agatha laughed.</p><p>Eternity stared at them, just <em> looked </em> as they shared this small, private delight, and felt a strange sensation in her chest. Her sister seemed… happy? She’d never seen Death smile before.</p><p>Infinity, too. Her white teeth were glinting.</p><p>It made her realize, with a quiet sort of astonishment, just how lonely the heavens were.</p><p>Humans could wear their thoughts and feelings on their faces. How lucky they were. They could touch, and hold. Eternity had never held something before. Not truly, she realized.</p><p>“Uh,” Agatha stared down at her finger, which Eternity was suddenly gripping with a fierceness. “Do you need something?”</p><p>Eternity released it urgently, a deep flush on her cheeks.</p><p>“I—I don’t know why I—”</p><p>Death’s eyes fell on her own. Her sister’s were uncharacteristically soft. Understanding. Eternity instantly hated it, resisted it. What had this woman done to her?</p><p>Eternity stood abruptly from her chair.</p><p>“I need to use the er—” </p><p>Agatha waved her off. “The bathroom’s down the hall.”</p><p>Eternity nodded, threw her napkin down, and stalked away.</p><p> </p><p>☆ ★</p><p> </p><p>“I’m glad your sisters decided to stay the night,” Agatha said.</p><p>The sink water was running loudly. Moonlight seeped through the window. The two women were alone now in the kitchen, just Agatha and Death.</p><p>Eternity and Infinity were upstairs, in the bathroom, currently exploring the miracle that was facial cleanser and bar soap.</p><p>“I can’t believe you invited them.”</p><p>Rio didn’t sound angry, but she didn’t sound happy, either. Agatha sighed.</p><p>She set down the dish she was cleaning, and walked over to her, circling her arms around Rio’s middle, perching her chin on Death’s shoulder and pressing a single kiss to her neck.</p><p>“Well, you certainly weren’t going to.”</p><p>“For good reason.”</p><p>Agatha withdrew so she could look Death in the eyes. “And that reason is…?”</p><p>“We don’t get along.”</p><p>“I don’t see why not. They’re nice enough. Certainly better than my blood relations.”</p><p>“You’ve known them for all of three minutes, Agatha. I’ve spent an—”</p><p>“<em>Eternity </em> with them?” Agatha wiggled her eyebrows.</p><p>Rio took the napkin she was holding and threw it at Agatha’s chest, rolling her eyes. Agatha cackled. Rio tried prying herself away, but Agatha only held on tighter, laughing like a school girl as she buried herself in Rio’s neck.</p><p>This charade went on for several seconds before the laughter between them died down, and a quiet, intimate silence was all that was left.</p><p>Agatha, per usual, was first to break it.</p><p>“I know you have a shaky relationship with your family,” she said, then paused. Chuckled dryly. “And listen, <em> mi amor</em>, I understand what that’s like. Hell, I’d rather burn at the stake than be forced to make small talk with my own mother. But… I could sense that some part of you missed them. Even if you don’t want to admit it. And tonight just confirmed for me that I made the right decision. Infinity is an endearing know-it-all, and Eternity…”</p><p>Rio stiffened under her touch. Agatha pressed another kiss to the back of her neck, and goosebumps snaked up her skin.</p><p>“Eternity is your sore spot.”</p><p>“It’s not a sore spot, it’s a red, angry wound. She’d rather I blink out of Existence.”</p><p>“I don’t think that’s true.”</p><p>Rio sighed and massaged her temples, the moonlight bathing her soft skin in blue. Agatha smiled delicately, and thought, not for the first time, that Rio looked most beautiful at night. Seeping out of the shadows like a snake. Her pretty red mouth like a soft flicker of light. Religion had truly failed to depict the beauty of the devil.</p><p>“It is true,” Rio confessed, and Agatha brushed a hair out of her eyes. “We’ve never agreed on anything, ever since we were kids.”</p><p>“On <em> anything</em>?”</p><p>“Nothing at all.”</p><p>“Tell me, then. Which argument started it? There’s always one.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “I don’t know what you mean.”</p><p>Agatha yawned. “Listen, sweet-cheeks. Conflicts aren’t very complicated. They all start because of a single miscommunication, and then either you resolve that then and there, or they fester like infections, and turn into malignant beasts. I’m pretty sure this long standing celestial beef probably has a single origin point. Resolve that, and you’ll be good as new.”</p><p>Rio scoffed.</p><p>“Even if that’s true, I have no idea what it is. The thing that started it.”</p><p>Agatha ran her hand through Rio’s hair, playing at her scalp, and Death studied her with a fondness.</p><p>Since arriving on Earth, Rio had seen Agatha burn and destroy pretty much every relationship in her life with complete apathy. And here she was, acting as some kind of familial relationship coach. It was terribly amusing.</p><p>“Sure you do. It’s that piece of metal lodged in your gut that’s still painful to the touch. Dig deep, I’m sure you’ll find it.”</p><p>With that, Agatha patted her once on the cheek, equal parts genuine and condescending.</p><p>If Agatha was a stew, Rio thought, those would be her two main ingredients. One simply could not exist without the other.</p><p>“By the way, I’m going to need you to kill someone for me later. Lady named Jen. Bald. Annoyingly tall.” Agatha had turned away, nonchalantly stalking toward the bedroom. “She sold me a defective product. It was supposed to summon tomatoes. Gave me salmon instead.”</p><p>Rio shook her head. She was so hopelessly in love with this utter fool.</p><p>“For the last time, Agatha, I don’t <em> kill </em> people.”</p><p>Agatha turned back. Flashed a damning grin at her.</p><p>“Have a growth mindset, honey. You don’t kill people <em> yet</em>. It’s a new year. We can all work on ourselves.”</p><p> </p><p>☆ ★</p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness was a great host, as Agatha Harkness would tell you. But you know what she was even better at?</p><p>Being a tour guide.</p><p>A tour guide of the human experience.</p><p>“You really don’t have to pay for jewelry?” Infinity asked, bewilderment coloring her face. “I know I haven’t exactly done much field research until now, but I could have sworn humans typically give something of monetary value in exchange for goods and services?”</p><p>They were strolling through one of Salem’s infamous Saturday Farmers Markets. The market stalls were flush with equal parts vegetables and knitwear, bracelets and scarves and second-hand petticoats. It was a crowded affair, so, naturally, Agatha was taking advantage of that, and sampling the merchandise.</p><p>“Honey, you don’t have to pay for anything unless they catch you,” she said, grinning wolfishly as she shook her new gold-encrusted bracelet in front of Infinity’s face. </p><p>“It’s called stealing,” Rio informed her sister with a roll of her eyes once they were out of earshot. </p><p>Infinity looked positively scandalized.</p><p>“Eternity, our sister is dating a <em> thief! </em>”</p><p>Eternity didn’t hear her. She was too consumed by her reflection in the mirror.</p><p>A leopard print coat was slung over her shoulders, a wide-brimmed straw hat atop her head.</p><p>She was feeling something utterly strange again, studying the outfit. A sort of… satisfaction?</p><p>“I look beautiful,” she said plainly, realizing it.</p><p>A woman approached her, smiling in a way that felt strangely pitying. “You sure do, ma’am. Would you like to buy those?”</p><p>Eternity blinked at her. “<em>Buy? </em>”</p><p>She searched her pockets stupidly. She had no money. Of course she had no money. She was on <em> Earth </em>. She was slumping around in some woman’s body, pretending it was her own. What was she doing? </p><p>She began to shuck the coat off, but a hand stopped her.</p><p>“How much?”</p><p>Eternity was staring at Death’s back. She was completely stunned, too stunned to intervene as a pocketbook was pulled out, and a hundred dollar bill traveled from her sister’s hand into this woman’s cash register. The whole ordeal lasted no more than a few seconds, but she felt it like an…</p><p>She frowned.</p><p>
<em> An eternity.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>☆ ★</p><p> </p><p>“We could have easily stolen that jacket,” Agatha muttered. “I would have sent you guys ahead, and then I could have circled back…”</p><p>“Paying money for things isn’t illegal, Agatha.”</p><p>“It is to me. It goes against my principles.”</p><p>“Principles of what?”</p><p>“Having a good time on this planet while it lasts. It’s a human thing, you wouldn’t understand.”</p><p>Rio and Agatha squabbled in the kitchen, their voices carrying faintly through the crack in the door as Eternity and Infinity sat in the living room. The rabbit had been kind enough to lend them the sofa for the evening.</p><p>Eternity eyed the door, then her sister, and lowered her voice.</p><p>“This is <em> strange</em>,” she muttered.</p><p>Infinity was consumed by looking at her nails, which Agatha had freshly painted red.</p><p>“Huh?” She perked her head up, then frowned. “What’s strange?”</p><p>Eternity threw her hands up as if it was abundantly obvious, which it was. “Um, hello? All of this? Pretending to be humans? Going shopping? Watching Death… fraternize with this… <em> person! </em> I mean, we were supposed to stop by for one single dinner. Now it’s gone on for two days. It’s quite enough, I think. We should be getting back.”</p><p>Infinity frowned like a child. “But I don’t want to be getting back.” She sighed. “I’m having too much fun here. Also, don’t be rude. Agatha is much more than a person. She’s a <em> witch </em>.”</p><p>“You can’t be serious,” Eternity balked. “Do you hear yourself?”</p><p>Infinity began to braid her blonde hair. Death had taught her how to french braid it earlier, and now she couldn’t stop doing it.</p><p>“Loud and clear,” she said. “If you want to go back, fine. Go back. But I’m going to stay a little longer.”</p><p>Eternity opened her mouth, then closed it, a cold fury bubbling under her veins. She rose up from the couch.</p><p>“I’m going to my—” She yelled, then paused. “<em> The </em> room. I’m going to the room.”</p><p>Rio and Agatha emerged a few moments later to find Infinity alone on the couch, softly petting the rabbit in her lap.</p><p>“I think Eternity might need a minute,” she said, then, when Agatha snickered, she realized the joke. She smiled wide. “Oh, Death, I’m starting to get it. Being human is truly hilarious.”</p><p> </p><p>☆ ★</p><p> </p><p>It was in the middle of the night when Rio and her sister finally spoke to each other. Of course, it was completely on accident.</p><p>They both fidgeted for the bathroom light at the same time, their hands colliding. Rio apologized, then Eternity, the light turning on at once and revealing just who they were talking to.</p><p>“Oh.” Rio said. A sullen look took over her face immediately. “Sorry, you can use the toilet. There’s another one downstairs. Agatha was just in the shower, so I thought…”</p><p>“No— no, it’s fine.”</p><p>They both backed out of the room, only to stumble into each other again as they exited the doorframe. It was all so ridiculous that it drew a laugh out of them both. A laugh that became several laughs, until they were bent over in the hallway.</p><p>“Jeez,” Rio said. “We’re terrible at this.”</p><p>Eternity smirked at her. “<em> Jeez </em>. Isn’t that a derivative of the human Christian god? Are you blaspheming Mother?”</p><p>“A little blasphemy is good for the soul, don’t you think?”</p><p>A beat passed between them. The hallway light flickered, and Rio could faintly hear Agatha singing in the shower. She sounded horrendous, performing a cover of Diet Mountain Dew by Lana Del Rey like she was being paid to do so, paying no heed to anyone who might be trying to sleep.</p><p>“So,” Eternity said, licking her lips. “A girlfriend, huh?”</p><p>Rio turned the color of the sun. “Oh, <em> shut up</em>.”</p><p>Another beat. Just when Rio thought they might change things between them, might soften the edges that had haunted their relationship for so long, Eternity shook her head.</p><p>“I just can’t believe it,” she said.</p><p>Rio frowned. “Believe what?”</p><p>“A <em> human </em> girlfriend! A mortal!” Eternity laughed, positively manic with disbelief. “<em>You!"</em></p><p>"I don't see what's so funny."</p><p>Eternity balked at her. "<em>Sister</em>. You couldn’t stand the existence of a mere star! Do you know how long a star lives? Millions. No, trillions of years! And yet you’ve picked a human that will live for a paltry hundred years at best! Tell me, what is it you want from her? Does the smallness of her lifespan make you angry?” </p><p>She cascaded closer to Rio, dropping her voice two octaves. “Really, sister. I don’t understand. Is this some sort of sadism? You <em> hate </em> mortality. You despise things for having the audacity to exist so temporarily. You must hate this woman, then? That’s the only explanation. That you’re simply waiting around for her to die?”</p><p>All signs of a smile had dropped from Death’s face. She was staring at Eternity with her jaw dropped, her eyes wide.</p><p>“Is that…” Rio blinked at her. “Is that really what you think of me?”</p><p>Eternity’s eyebrows furrowed.</p><p>“What I think of you? Sister, this is what I <em>know</em> of you.” Her frown deepened, turned to a scowl. “You hate things that live. You always have. When I made my first star, you <em> killed </em> that star.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth was agape for several seconds before it hit her.</p><p>“Oh my god. This is what Agatha was talking about.”</p><p>“Agatha was— what–”</p><p>“You’re upset with me over a <em> star.</em> A star.”</p><p>Eternity sputtered, baffled. “Upset with you? I’m not <em> upset.</em>”</p><p>“You are! You are so upset with me!”</p><p>“I am <em> not</em>!”</p><p>“Then why are we yelling!”</p><p>White puffs of air were coming out of both their nostrils now, like two bulls in a ring. Rio took a shaky breath in, covered her face, and groaned. Agatha’s shower water had stopped.</p><p>She looked down at the floorboards.</p><p>“I didn’t kill your star on purpose,” she said quietly.</p><p>“You—” Eternity was still yelling when she said the first part, but then quickly stopped when she processed what Rio had said. “Wait. What? What are you talking about? You told me you hated <em> it </em>…”</p><p>Rio looked up at her with an expression that was a cross between angry and embarrassed.</p><p>“I said that <em> after </em> I did it, Eternity. I said that because you were mad at me, and I didn’t know what else to say.” She breathed in sharply. “I killed the star by accident. I didn’t mean to. I just wanted to… play with you guys. So I tried touching the gas you had melded together, and I blew it up instead. Because that’s what my touch does to things. That’s what my touch has <em> always </em> done to things. Destroy them. Until now. Until I took this body, and became… human.”</p><p>She hiccupped. Two tears were streaking down Rio’s face.</p><p>Eternity felt suddenly helpless.</p><p>“So <em> no. </em>I am not here because I’m a sadist. I’m not with Agatha because I want to watch her die. I’m with her because I want to watch her <em> live. </em> I’m with her because she is the most <em> alive </em> thing in the entire universe. I’ve seen stars up close, and I’ve still never met anything that’s burned brighter than this… this woman. And with these hands…” She thrust up her two palms. “I can actually <em> touch </em> her.”</p><p>Eternity reached out for her sister, but Death was already storming down the stairs.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha had been born an only child to an abusive mother, but more importantly, she’d been born a know-it-all with a pathological addiction to the Dunning-Krueger effect, so she didn’t wonder even once if she was the right person to be responsible for healing Death’s family woes.</p><p>It just seemed like the most logical option.</p><p>Okay, that <em> and </em> because Rio wasn’t coming out of the bedroom, which was a problem. See, another thing Agatha was pathological about was the Sunday lunch discount at Two Moon Taqueria.</p><p>Reliably stealing tacos was difficult - they’re too messy to stick in pockets or handbags, the prep time means the chef can get a good look at your face to later put on a wanted “taco thief” poster - and on top of that, it is especially hard when there was only one good place in town to get them, so she couldn’t just <em> miss </em> Discount Day. </p><p>That was tantamount to missing your kid’s birthday party, or whatever.</p><p>(Luckily this was an internal monologue and not an external one, or else Rio would have reminded Agatha just how many times she forgot about Nicky’s birthday, so much so that Rio had to sign her up for one of those birthday reminder websites that would send push notifications to her phone. Anyway.)</p><p>“If you’re not out of the room in the next” – Agatha looked down at her phone, and tried not to dribble toothpaste on it – “twenty five seconds, we’re not going to make it to Two Moons on time.” </p><p>Agatha was brushing her teeth, sitting on the toilet, and playing a Scrabble match with Nicky on her phone simultaneously, trying to get all her morning errands done quickly to make up for Rio’s lateness. </p><p>Downstairs, Eternity and Infinity were bustling away at their own morning routine, which mostly included trying on the clothes that Agatha had loaned them. She couldn’t be seen about town with people who insisted on wearing the same outfit everyday.</p><p>“Still not coming,” Rio muttered from the bedroom.</p><p>“Sure you are.” Agatha kicked open the bedroom door with her foot, electric toothbrush still buzzing in her mouth, and threw a sweatshirt at Rio. “Put this on.”</p><p>Rio looked down at it and frowned.</p><p>“Harvard Law. Agatha, where did you even—”</p><p>“Sometimes I pose as a professor there to get access to the dining hall.” Agatha threw socks at her next. “Ronaldo at the pizza bar makes a mean deep-dish.”</p><p>Rio was reminded for the upteenth time why she didn’t ask Agatha what Agatha did on her, quote unquote, “Self-care Days”</p><p>Nevertheless, her enamoration for her girlfriend was an annoyingly powerful aphrodisiac, one that had her pulling the sweatshirt over her head without really realizing it. </p><p>Once she did realize, though, she groaned, and began taking it back off. </p><p>“I’m serious, Agatha. I’m not going.”</p><p>Agatha paused mid-putting-on-sock, her leg in the air as she pinned Rio with a stare. She looked completely ridiculous.</p><p>“You can’t just avoid Eternity forever, honey.” She then proceeded to snort at her own sentence. “I mean, just listen to how that sounds.”</p><p>“I <em>actually</em> – God, the puns — Agatha, we can’t help the fact that all our names are tied to inevitable celestial processes.” Rio pressed her forefinger to the bridge of her nose. “I can absolutely avoid her if I want to. I’m an adult woman.”</p><p>“<em> Eh.. </em>” Agatha waved her hand around. “I feel like you’re still maybe twenty-two in Universe years. So it’s best to listen to me, your older and wiser—”</p><p>Rio groaned loud enough to make Agatha stop talking. “Universe years are not a real thing!” It came out more petulant and childish than she intended, her hands pressed into fists. She let out a sigh when Agatha gave her an expression that said <em> look, see? </em> “Okay. Fuck, I’m hearing it. That was a little whiny. But don’t act like you’re somehow the more emotionally mature one in this relationship.”</p><p>“Never said I was. Just that I’m the older one.”</p><p>When Rio just glared at her some more, Agatha bit her lip, then whined, “Baby. I can feel my tacos wasting away in someone else’s stomach and it’s making me really, really sad.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh at the ridiculous genuinity in Agatha’s words. Her addiction to Mexican food teetered on concerning.</p><p>Was she really going to face her jerk of a sister just to appease her insane girlfriend? Yes. Yes, it was looking like it.</p><p>“Fine.” She pulled on the Harvard sweatshirt and refused to look at Agatha’s blinding smile as she began to shuffle toward the door. “But next weekend, I’m forcing you to pay for something at the Farmers Market.”</p><p>Agatha’s horror-movie gasp of displeasure was worth it, in the end.</p><p> </p><p>☆ ★</p><p> </p><p>“You have a <em> son? </em>”</p><p>Rio did not previously think it possible to experience mortification at this level before. But with half of Salem’s millennial population now staring at them like this was a lesbian spinoff of <em> Are You The Father? </em>, she was there. She had reached it.</p><p>The reveal had come spilling out of Agatha’s lips with as much nonchalance as when she ordered their tacos. Actually, Agatha had been <em> more </em> serious about the taco order. Pulling a picture of Nicky up on her phone and proudly slipping it across the table for Eternity and Infinity to gawk at was done with at most, a shrug.</p><p>“How is this…” Infinity blinked, then squeaked, “<em> Possible? </em>”</p><p>“You were gone for like four weeks!” Eternity whisper-shouted, slamming her hands on the table. “Four weeks, and you’re a <em> mother? </em> To a human being?”</p><p>“Four <em> universe </em> weeks,” Rio said, arms crossed and eyes shifted elsewhere. “That’s like… Thirty Earth years.”</p><p>“Oh, so <em> now </em> universe time is real?” Agatha snorted.</p><p>“I really feel like we’re glossing over the fact that this shouldn’t be possible,” Infinity interjected, an expression in her eyes that seemed dangerously close to losing it. “Only Mother should be capable of spontaneous creation.”</p><p>“I’ll have you know I am <em> very good </em> at spontaneous creation,” Agatha winked. Infinity’s jaw loosened even more. Eternity groaned, muttering <em> that isn’t even a joke, it’s just gross </em>. Agatha continued, “Anything is possible when you put your mind to it, ladies.”</p><p>“I am not sure that applies to Death conceiving children,” Infinity replied, mouth still ajar.</p><p>“This is the United States, dear. You dream it, it’s possible. American dream, baby.”</p><p>Rio was having trouble believing the words her ears were experiencing.</p><p>“Agatha, you’re on like, every single watchlist available to the US government. Are you seriously espousing the American dream?”</p><p>Agatha groaned, waving her hand through the air. </p><p>“All because I tried to skip out on airport security. I mean, they want a lady to take off her <em> shoes </em>. Bunch of voyeurs…”</p><p>An unavoidable Nicky Q&amp;A naturally proceeded — How old was he? Twenty-one. Was he actually 50% Death? More like 70%, answered Agatha bitterly. She had carried him, but he was the spitting image of Rio. </p><p>What was he like? Sweet, caring, funny, said Rio, at the same time that Agatha said <em> well, he mostly got Rio’s personality, too</em>, with so much badly-disguised adoration that it nearly spilled from her mouth onto the table. </p><p>The tacos arrived, allowing Rio a momentary breather. Agatha devoured like fifteen of them in rapid succession, while Infinity and Eternity poked at the hard shells curiously until inevitably shoveling down a fair share of their own once they realized tacos were, as Infinity put it, “made of magic.”</p><p> </p><p>☆ ★</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t believe you told them about Nicky,” Rio muttered to Agatha while they were in the taco shop bathroom, a small reprieve before they all headed out for the next item on Agatha’s Sunday agenda. “That was – that was not how I imagined telling them.”</p><p>Agatha was adjusting her hair in the mirror. It wasn’t cooperating by her standards, which meant by Rio’s standards it looked gorgeous – messy, unruly, very <em>her</em>.</p><p>She eyed Rio in the reflection with a smile that was almost apologetic. Keyword, almost. “How would you have preferred to do it? At an Italian place? Over lasagna? We can try again. I can wipe their memory and make a reservation at Bertuccis.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip, shaking her head at her <em> rude, rude </em> girlfriend.</p><p>“You’re mean, you know that?”</p><p>Agatha gave her a delicious grin in return.</p><p>“I’m <em> necessary. </em> ” She withdrew from the mirror and blew out a breath. “It didn’t feel like the right time because there was never going to be a right time. You were never going to tell them. You weren’t even going to tell them about <em> me </em> before all this, remember?”</p><p>Rio said nothing, because Agatha was right. And she couldn’t just give her that satisfaction.</p><p>“Plus, it was worth it for that look on Eternity’s face,” Agatha said, putting on her best impression of a shocked eighty year old woman. “It’s a good thing she’s not actually a real elderly lady. I think she would have dropped dead from a heart attack.”</p><p> </p><p>☆ ★</p><p> </p><p>Ultimately, Rio admitted quietly to herself, telling them about Nicky had been the right thing to do. It was like ripping off the final bandaid. Now she felt fully exposed, her humanity a ripe wound for Eternity to poke at. </p><p>But, even more strangely— Eternity didn’t poke.</p><p>No, Eternity just - infuriatingly - <em> watched </em> her. Watched her as they went to the mall, as Agatha introduced them to pretzel bites and food court Chinese food. As Infinity got her ears pierced at Claire’s.</p><p>And while everyone watched her sister scream at the underpaid sixteen year old with the piercing gun, Eternity’s eyes were stuck to Rio, her pupils wide, like a scared deer.</p><p>It was driving Rio insane. Because Eternity had never, ever, in the history of the universe, been quiet. She had never held her tongue. So watching her do so, so <em> obviously </em>, it was maddening. She was all but forcing Rio to call her out on it.</p><p>She was forced to her breaking point at the shoe store.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio hissed. “Enough of this. Out with it already.”</p><p>Through the storefront glass, she watched Agatha and Infinity trying on heels. Meanwhile, Eternity and Rio had been sequestered to the walkway outside, both of them too tired and overstimulated to keep shopping any longer. Of course, Eternity had <em> not </em> been too tired to stop glaring at her.</p><p>Eternity’s eyebrows snapped up when Rio spoke to her. As if she’d been caught shoplifting.</p><p>“Out with what?”</p><p>Rio glared at her. </p><p>“Don’t play dumb. You’ve been staring at me <em> all day.</em> I can’t take it anymore. Whatever you want to say to me, just say it.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Eternity’s cheeks colored red. She looked… embarrassed?</p><p><em> First time for everything, </em>Rio thought.</p><p>Almost as if Eternity had heard her thought, she laughed bitterly, “I think humanity must change everything it touches. I feel quite unlike myself.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Okay, you know what. If whatever is rolling around in your head is just some diatribe about how humanity corrupts the <em> perfect celestial soul </em> , then hard <em> pass </em>. I’m fine being corrupted. If you’re not, you can just—”</p><p>To Rio’s surprise, Eternity shook her head back and forth fervently. “No! No… It’s not that at all, actually.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio was even more confused. “Then…?”</p><p>“I wanted to apologize.”</p><p><em> Okay, maybe humanity does corrupt the perfect celestial soul.</em> Rio’s jaw nearly dropped to the floor, but she kept it firmly square, not wanting to show just how affected she was by that statement.</p><p>“You? Apologize?”</p><p>Eternity pinched the bridge of her wrinkled nose. She was blushing even more now. “Don’t ruin it.”</p><p>Rio mockingly checked her watch. “Ah, yes. Your bout of kindness lasted a startling three seconds.”</p><p>“Will you be serious with me for a whole minute, please?”</p><p>Eternity practically growled out the sentence. Frankly startled, Rio lowered her arm to her side, and slowly nodded.</p><p>“First of all. Well. I want to apologize for blaming you for the star. You didn’t kill it. You simply… changed its phase of being.”</p><p>Rio blinked at her in disbelief.</p><p>“Its phase of… what?”</p><p>“Its state. You changed its state,” Eternity repeated, like a tutting Physics teacher. “It would never have emitted such brilliant light without combustion.”</p><p>Eternity looked up at the ceiling, which was one big glass frame. They had a clear view of the sky. “Humans would never even see stars unless you had touched them. Their light wouldn’t travel this far without you.”</p><p>Rio stared speechlessly back at her sister. Eternity slowly lowered her head again, and smiled softly. </p><p>“It makes sense to me now. That out of all of us, you’d inherit Mother’s ability to create. That you’d be the only one of us with offspring,” Eternity said. “I was… looking at Death all wrong, I think. Ugh -” Eternity laughed, rolled her eyes. “Our names make this impossible. But I suppose I was misunderstanding both you <em> and </em> the concept of you. I was misunderstanding…”</p><p>Eternity waved her hands around messily. Rio couldn’t help but recognize that she must have been studying the way that Agatha moved - the wild gestures that she so loved - and picked something up along the way.</p><p>“Death isn’t about an end, it’s about a moment of change. And maybe I’ve known that all along. Maybe I’ve been jealous. Because you’re the only one with any real agency in anything, you know?”</p><p>Eternity frowned. Rio felt something deep within her chest unwind. She felt like crying, her lip trembling.</p><p>Eternity must have noticed. Her face reddened deeper. “Oh, don’t look at me like that.”</p><p>A single tear streaked down Rio’s face, and she shook her head, laughing it off. Eternity, the old woman that she was, huffed out a breath of disbelief at the show of emotion - the final piece of resistance - before reaching forward, tugging Rio into a tight embrace. The first embrace Death and Eternity had ever shared.</p><p>From inside the store, Agatha and Infinity watched on.</p><p>“I really do believe you’re a witch now,” Infinity said.</p><p>Agatha scoffed, offended. “Only now? I hardly need magic to make a man faint.”</p><p>A very unlucky cashier lay unconscious behind them. Agatha was lazily stacking boxes of shoes into a backpack.</p><p>“Not that,” she laughed, then pointed out the window. “<em>Them</em>.”</p><p>“Oh.” She let out a laugh, and rolled her eyes. “I didn’t do that. I’m no family counselor.”</p><p>Infinity shook her head, helping Agatha zip up the backpack. She squatted to face her head-on, and Agatha’s eyebrows went up when Infinity cupped her cheek, patting it with almost familial affection.</p><p>“I think I underestimated humanity,” she said. “But if I’ve learned anything by being here, it’s <em> you all </em> that truly underestimate yourselves.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened, then closed.</p><p>But before she could say something unlike herself, something as humiliating as a <em>thank you,</em> a commotion started in the walkway. Two young men were looking at Rio and Eternity with alarmed expressions.</p><p>One of them turned to another, and said loud enough for Agatha to hear, “Isn’t that the old woman who went missing at the nursing home?”</p><p>Eternity turned to Rio. “Oh, shit. Run!”</p><p> </p><p>☆ ★</p><p> </p><p>The four women stood at the precipice of Agatha’s house.</p><p>An entire week had wisped by without them really noticing. The sisters had run the gambit of the human experience—gone shopping, hiking, swimming, yelling at teenagers in the park. </p><p>Agatha would never admit it, but for the first time in her life, she had actually begun to understand what family felt like.</p><p>“Are you sure you have to leave?” Rio asked petulantly, leaning on the doorframe.</p><p>“<em>Someone </em> must watch Mother,” Eternity teased, but there was no venom in it. Infinity added, “And someone else has to watch Eternity.”</p><p>The group laughed, and the wind whipped softly across the lawn. There wasn’t much else to say. Sometimes, when something is so purely good, attempting to put it into words only worsens it.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. She pushed Rio gently aside, to Death’s surprise, and extended her hand toward Infinity and Eternity. She was holding out a letter—an envelope.</p><p>“What’s this?” Infinity asked.</p><p>“A dinner invitation,” Agatha said.</p><p>“Aren’t you supposed to send these in the mail?”</p><p>“What, when you’re standing right here?” Agatha scoffed. “You clearly haven’t learned anything. I’m not paying for the cosmic post stamps if I don’t need to.”</p><p>They laughed again. Infinity moved to open it, but Agatha laid her hand over it.</p><p>“No,” she said gently. “Only when you’re home.”</p><p> </p><p>☆ ★</p><p> </p><p>So, they left.</p><p>And when Infinity and Eternity spread their legs on the couch that was the Heavens, they opened Agatha’s letter.</p><p> </p><p>☆ ★</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Dear Eternity, and Infinity, </em>
</p><p>
<em> I don’t say this often, so you better savor it. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Thank you. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> ..Oh, and dinner next Thursday. Nicky will be there. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Expect more stew. </em>
