     Summary
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Settled into a steady rhythm of fiery trysts and open contempt, Agatha and Rio have long since left their happy life together behind. When a lawyer reaches out one day about joining a class action lawsuit pertaining to the death of their son, Agatha’s immediate refusal falls on deaf ears and the two women find themselves drawn into a situation much larger than their own grief.
     </p>
     <p>
      After three years of hardening her heart, Agatha is thrust back into the murky waters of her grief and the jumbled mess of her feelings for Rio. With help from unlikely places, she begins to realize that maybe there's a middle ground between total isolation and pretending nothing's wrong.
     </p>
     <p>
      What happens when Agatha has to navigate being in Rio’s orbit again outside of just sex? Will she ever find a way to move past her resentment and be the woman she was before? And, most importantly, can she ever really forgive herself for Nicky’s death?

    <blockquote>
     <p>
      hi! some quick housekeeping.
     </p>
     <p>
      -this is my very first attempt at a multi chapter fic so you may have to bear with me a bit here! so far ive got like 9 chapters outlined so there will be, at a minimum, 9 chapters
     </p>
     <p>
      -this work is the second in a series but if you really don't want to you don't have to read the first one to understand this one I don't think. the gist of 'birds in flight' being that Nicky died three years prior and Agatha &amp; Rio's relationship has totally fallen apart, except sometimes they link up to fuck nasty style
     </p>
     <p>
      -the real meat of the plot doesn't come in for a few chapters tbh, I had some Establishing to do. I am not sorry
     </p>
     <p>
      -all chapter titles come from Richard Siken's poem "Litany in Which Certain Things Are Crossed Out." it is incredible (like all of his work) and I recommend you check it out!
     </p>
     <p>
      -I have no beta so all mistakes are my own.
     </p>
     <p>
      I think that's it! pls enjoy

     Dear So-and-So, I’m sorry I came to your party and seduced you

   <!--chapter content-->
   <div>
    <p>
     From her current vantage point along the back wall Agatha can see the full layout of the small coffee shop– the baristas leaning on the counters to gossip between orders, the stay at home mom rocking the stroller back and forth with her foot while she inhales her coffee, and the sweaty businessman taking an obnoxiously loud phone call all blending in with the predictable lo-fi music humming through the tinny speakers.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whole place is trying a bit too hard to be unique in her opinion, from the haphazardly strung string lights to the mismatched chairs ringing the tables, like they
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     want their patrons to think they’d found all of the furniture secondhand somewhere and hadn’t just ordered it all from a manufacturer. The plush burgundy armchair beneath her still smells like a warehouse, though, so the execution is a bit lacking.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha knows she can’t fault them too much, because she was the one who had punched
     <em>
      coffee shop
     </em>
     into Google Maps and picked a spot across town at random. She had awoken this morning with the distinct feeling that if she spent the day working from home like usual she’d end up throwing herself head first down the stairs, so this had been the alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even though nothing has explicitly changed, a looming cloud of dread has been following her since that night in November, memories long undisturbed now deciding to wait around corners and beneath the floorboards and sneak up on her when she least expects.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha has made no memories at
     <em>
      Stir It Up
     </em>
     , no possibility of a familiar scent or an old photo to make her palms clammy and her throat tight. It also seems to finally be done snowing for the season, so she hadn’t had to layer up beyond her faded jeans and an old baby blue college sweatshirt beneath her coat. She’d managed to survive through January– the anniversary of his death coming and going with all of the usual agony– and is working on slogging her way through February, more than ready for this godforsaken winter to finally end.
    </p>
    <p>
     The open document on her laptop stares up at her mockingly, waiting for the edits and notes she was supposed to have sent in yesterday. She glances at the little red bubble above the envelope icon at the bottom of the screen, wondering if it would be any less painful to go through the pile of unanswered emails in her inbox. Her half empty iced latte rests on the side table next to her, slowly but surely sweating a ring of condensation into the wood as the ice melts. Agatha shifts, tucking one leg up under herself and silently begging herself to focus on the task at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     She gets three minutes into demolishing her poor, incompetent subordinate’s report when the bell chimes over the door, and whoever passes through leaves it open for too long. A cold gust of air slices clean through the warmth of the cafe and sends a shiver down Agatha’s spine. She looks up to find the culprit, a scowl already firmly in place before she realizes what she’s seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio is there, holding the door open for a woman to walk through behind her, returning the smile she’s offered. When the door is shut again, Rio holds her hand out for the woman’s coat while she shimmies out of it and hands it over before taking the garment to a table near the front window and draping it over the back of one chair. She does the same with her own, like she’s done this a thousand times. She walks back to join the woman in front of the large chalkboard menu, resting her hands in the pockets of her high waisted black slacks. The sleeves of her white dress shirt are rolled up to her elbows like she was getting frustrated with them being in her way at work this morning, but her appearance is otherwise pristine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hair, tucked behind one ear to expose a set of small silver hoops, falls in glossy, controlled waves. All of her bruising from November is gone, of course. Agatha would know– she’d watched the teeth marks on her own shoulder fade and eventually disappear in the mirror. She looks put together, suave, a total match with the woman by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman is beautiful in a quietly glamorous sort of way, her thick chestnut hair clipped back from her face and falling around her shoulders, an emerald skirt suit hugging her curvy figure just on the publicly acceptable side of sensuality. Agatha thinks the woman looks younger than Rio and herself, maybe still in her late 20’s. Her full red lips curve in another small smile when Rio ushers her forward to order and then pays for them both.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha realizes her heart is pounding in her chest and jerks her head back down to her computer screen, trying to focus on the little blinking cursor and the words swimming before her eyes. How had she not realized she’d picked a spot so close to Rio’s office? And why is Rio even out of said office at one in the afternoon on a work day?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pushes her glasses back up on the bridge of her nose from where they’ve slipped with her knuckles, silently fuming. The anger starts to boil in her chest, her face growing hot. She just wants one goddamn moment for herself– one entirely bland day where nothing at all happens and no ghosts come to call. Agatha can’t help but track the motion of the barista handing over their drinks and Rio resting her hand against the small of the woman’s back while she guides her to the table where she left their coats.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fire of her rage ratchets up inside of her further, and Agatha wonders if committing arson would really be so bad. Burning down not only the coffee shop but maybe the entire strip mall and everyone inside of it rather than adding this stupid cafe to the list of places she can never come back to.
    </p>
    <p>
     It happens so quickly that Agatha almost misses it, too busy trying to calm herself down. Rio turns away from the woman just enough to cast her eyes to where Agatha sits in the back, honey brown locking onto crystal blue.
     <em>
      Like
     </em>
     magnets, she thinks bitterly. There’s no surprise there though, no shock value. Just that same, unreadable stare, gone as soon as it comes. Agatha watches the corners of those eyes crinkle up when she looks back at Skirt Suit, clearly giving some playful response to her last comment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wills her eyes back down to her work, opening up her email and clicking around her inbox at random without really reading any of it. She thinks back to the last time they'd seen each other, about what Rio had said about having someone new to Christmas shop for. Her own thoughts from that night dredge themselves up, of some woman waiting for Rio to come home, screaming and crying at the sight of Agatha’s marks all over her. Maybe it hadn't been as big of a deal for her as Agatha thought it might.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still nameless, but no longer faceless- Agatha watches Skirt Suit take a sip of her coffee and rest her chin on the palm of her hand. Her mind, unhelpful as ever, supplies an image of the two of them fucking on Christmas morning, Grinch-themed wrapping paper littering the floor around their writhing bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
     The uneasy feeling in Agatha’s gut– the sense of dread she’s been trying to outrun– returns in full. It only makes her angrier, really. Because truthfully? Rio is not supposed to be here. She’s not supposed to be anywhere in Agatha’s life that isn’t her bedroom, showing up to claw at each other like animals before leaving her alone again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had meticulously compartmentalized her– crammed Rio’s formerly all-encompassing role in her life down to just the voice in her head and the warm body staining her sheets. But now, in this subpar coffee shop and without any prior warning, Rio has seemingly broken out of the flimsy box Agatha had sealed her in. On one hand, she can’t believe it took this long for them to run into one another outside of the house or the cemetery. On the other, she had begun to hope they simply never would.
    </p>
    <p>
     Twenty emails opened and either trashed or unanswered later, Agatha can feel her patience wearing thin. Abandoning her earlier hope for a peaceful day and desperate to stop feeling like a caged animal, she resolves to start wrapping things up.
    </p>
    <p>
     She picks up the thin plastic cup of her iced latte, ignoring the way it makes her palm damp. Agatha takes a sip and holds the watered down liquid on her tongue while she reads the next paragraph of the report, mentally noting all of the things that she’ll need to change before this gets sent out. Her focus shatters like a windowpane struck by a baseball bat at the sound of Rio’s loud, unrestrained laughter from across the room. Agatha’s eyes find her immediately– the exposed column of her throat as her joy pulls her backwards, the gap between her teeth on full display with her smile. Agatha realizes it’s the first time she’s heard that sound in years.
    </p>
    <p>
     It tugs at the fragile threads keeping her sanity intact, the ones she’d forgotten to weave back in after watching Rio’s headlights pull away from her house and disappear into the night. Agatha doesn’t notice that she’s crushing the cup in her hand until the coffee splashes down across the hem of her sweatshirt and the leg of her jeans, the dark liquid immediately seeping in and chilling her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck
     </em>
     ,” she hisses quietly to herself, pushing her computer off of her lap and onto the coffee table by her feet. She sets the distorted cup back on the table, fruitlessly shaking her hand in the air to dry it off. A barista that has clearly watched her outburst rushes over from behind the counter, his eyes wide beneath thick layers of smudged eyeliner.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my gosh ma’am, are you alright? Here, let me help.” He rushes out, quickly taking the cup and tossing it into a nearby trash can before wiping down the table and reaching out with a fistful of napkins, a flurry of motion.
    </p>
    <p>
     The heat in her face is so strong she knows she’s turned visibly red, anger swirling with embarrassment in her throat. Agatha stares down at the dark wet patch on her jeans, but she can feel those fucking eyes on her, burning through her skull and making her hands tremble. Of
     <em>
      course
     </em>
     she’s watching now, pulling her focus away from Skirt Suit for just long enough to witness Agatha’s public humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Get
     <em>
      off
     </em>
     of me. Don’t you know anything about personal space?” She spits at the kid, surely no more than 22, and shoots up from her chair when he takes a step back with his hands raised in surrender. His blubbered apology falls on deaf ears, Agatha shoulder checking him as she steps past and curves down the small back hall to where the single-occupant restroom lies.
    </p>
    <p>
     She shuts herself in and flicks on the fluorescent light with more force than she knows is necessary. Agatha can see the collection of bugs that have wriggled their way behind the plastic casing of the light and died for their curiosity. A black stall divider closes the toilet off from the counter, leaving her in a narrow pass with the door on one side and a large trash can close to overflowing on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulls a paper towel from the dispenser and begins dabbing hopelessly at her sweatshirt with the cheap, rough material. After what must be a decade and a half, the fabric is so worn it’s nearly translucent in places. It probably won’t survive the accident unscathed, she decides.
    </p>
    <p>
     So lost in the task at hand, Agatha doesn’t hear the door click quietly open and shut again. Doesn’t need to when all of the hairs on her body stand up of their own accord, straining toward her like sunflowers seeking light. In her mind, she curses her body’s apparent wiring to betray her at every turn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha doesn’t look at her directly, but shifts her eyes up enough to catch her in the big mirror covering the wall above the counter. Rio looks just as professional up close too, her light makeup hiding her eye bags and carefully applied blush bringing life back to her cheeks. Probably hoping to impress Skirt Suit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha knows she looks disheveled, but at least she brushed her hair this morning and is wearing real pants, which is more than she can say for most days. In her escape to the bathroom she pushed her glasses back up on her head, keeping the hair from her eyes while she works at the stain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wordlessly reaches past her to tear a fresh paper towel from the dispenser before tugging on the hem of Agatha’s sweatshirt, batting her hand lightly out of the way and taking over the task of blotting with much more grace than Agatha had been using. Unsure what to do with herself, Agatha crumples the damp paper towel in her fist so tightly that her nails dig into the meat of her palm. The sting mercifully lessens some of the pressure building in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slightly hunched over as she works, the thin chain of Rio’s necklace slips from beneath the collar of her blouse. It catches the light, drawing Agatha’s eye. Three small stones dangle at the center– purple, green, blue. Agatha, Rio, Nicky. Agatha had gotten it for her as a gift when he was born, pulling the tiny box out of their go bag once things had finally calmed down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her skin feels too tight, her lungs suddenly too small to get in a good breath. Agatha knows she has to break the moment before it breaks her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have my purple cardigan,” she bleats out. An accusation, the first thing that comes to mind. She’s not supposed to mention their previous encounters, but all of the rules seem to have been suspended here. She’s free falling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffs, but doesn’t look up from where she’s working, her fingers shifting to a different part of the stain.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’ve literally just spilled coffee all over
     <em>
      my
     </em>
     sweatshirt. Glass houses, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The words are measured, like she’s holding herself an arm’s length away from the situation. Agatha bites harshly at her bottom lip. She hadn’t remembered that this sweatshirt was Rio’s and not her own. She considers telling Rio that anything that’s closing in on 20 years spent in her closet belongs to her, but thinks better of it at the last minute.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wishes she would just look at her and not the stupid blue fabric in her hands, the frustration welling up in her throat. She grinds her teeth, choosing a different mode of attack.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A coffee date in the middle of the work day is a bit irresponsible, don’t you think?” She asks, her voice dripping in faux-innocence. At this, Rio does look up at her, her fingers stilling. The shock Agatha finds in her face only serves to encourage her, so she presses further.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Couldn’t wait until you were off the clock? I mean, I definitely get it. She’s hot. Probably, what– 27? 28 at most? God, I remember how much more flexible I was at that age. I can only imagine–”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     ,” Rio cuts off her rambling. Her voice is strained, caught somewhere between exasperation and…amusement?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha remembers herself, taking her bottom lip back between her teeth sharply in hopes it can serve as a makeshift gag. She wills her face not to flush with shame at the outburst– this is why she can’t operate around Rio without firm boundaries in place. Because she runs her fucking mouth. Gives too much away. Sets herself up to be vulnerable in the way that only ever seems to end in pain these days.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why did she even bring it up? All Rio is going to do is confirm her suspicions, maybe leave her with another cutting remark that’ll bleed for days.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s brought back by the sharp inhale Rio takes through her nose and lets out through her mouth. It’s how she calms herself down. How she always has. Her tongue darts out to wet her lips before she speaks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” she starts again, steadier this time. “This is the cafe closest to my office. Peggy is my new employee, and I’m conducting her three month check in meeting. I’m not– we’re not– she’s married. To a man.” Rio stumbles over her words and then, as if realizing how exposed she’s left herself, drops Agatha’s sweatshirt and straightens before tossing the paper towel she’s been using easily into the trash can on the opposite wall, freeing her arms up to cross over her chest defensively. Agatha feels the absence of her touch immediately, like something vital has been carved out of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tries not to feel the relief that washes over her at Rio’s assertion. At the adamance in her tone. Agatha builds the wall between them higher instead, desperate to force out the feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It wouldn’t matter if you were. We don’t owe each other anything,” she retorts, condescension dripping from her words. Rio merely stares down at her. Though they're no longer touching, Rio's still close enough that Agatha can see the amber and gold flecks in her dark irises, shifting as they search her face. What she’s looking for, Agatha can’t tell.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looks formidable, their height difference more apparent than usual with the boost from her heeled boots. An impassive queen surveying an unruly subject. In the past three years Rio seems to have perfected the art of staring Agatha down like this, breaking her down to nothing with only a look.
     <em>
      You don’t scare me
     </em>
     , Agatha wants to scream at her, but she's already dug herself a deep enough hole for today.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know,” Rio settles on at last, though her words feel weightier than just the small sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha presses the side of her fist against the damp spot left on her thigh by the spill, running her skin over the rough denim in hopes of soothing the mounting anxiety in her chest without having to show it. There is something else to be said, she knows. There is always something else to be said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, having said her piece, takes a half step back and holds her hand out, waiting. Agatha meets her outstretched palm, unfurling her fist and dropping the dirty paper towel. Rio merely tosses it into the trash bin like the one before, effortless, her arm flexing just slightly with the motion. She doesn’t pull her eyes away from where the paper arced through the air, ignoring Agatha’s lingering gaze on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Use the stain remover in the green tube and throw it all in the wash when you get home. It should come out pretty easily,” she says. Her tone is neutral, if not a bit relieved, like she’s surprised to be escaping this encounter in more or less one piece.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she turns and strides back toward the door to leave, something dormant in Agatha stirs to life with an immediate level-five-alarm sort of panic. Maybe it’s her fight or flight trigger, finally remembering that it knows how to work after shirking its duty for so long. Fitting that it would get its shit together right now, of all times.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if in a trance, Agatha lunges forward, closing her fingers around Rio’s wrist like a vice. She freezes beneath the touch, one hand still on the door handle, and turns to look at Agatha over her shoulder. Waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
     The gravity of what she’s done washes over her like ice water. Agatha had not thought this far. She hadn’t thought at all, really– she just knew that she didn’t want to end on that strange, almost friendly note.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Yes
     </em>
     , that was it, she couldn’t have Rio thinking they were friends now. Can’t have her getting ideas about things changing. Agatha digs for sharp words to hurl but comes up empty, her brain still running ten seconds behind, her mouth opening and closing again without sound.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s focus flits between Agatha’s eyes like she’s listening to her thoughts in real time. Finally, she relaxes, no longer rigid beneath Agatha’s touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This doesn’t have to mean anything,” she says softly, almost tender. Agatha visibly calms, her grip slackening around Rio’s wrist. She knows what she’s really saying is
     <em>
      we can go back to the cycle. Today doesn’t mean things have to change. I'll keep coming home again, and again and again until you forgive me. Or even if you never do. I am not expecting either of us to be kind now because of this.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     For just a moment their eyes meet, and Agatha allows herself to dip her chin in the ghost of a nod. An acknowledgement that she has heard. Rio returns the gesture before turning the handle, slipping out of the bathroom and out of Agatha’s grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gives herself twenty full minutes to stand in the bathroom willing herself not to throw up or put her fist through the glass of the mirror. When finally she goes back out, she sweeps her laptop back into her bag and shoves her coat under her arm with little ceremony. The table where Rio and Skirt Suit– no, Peggy– had been sitting is now occupied by an elderly man, cupping a steaming mug in one hand and reading a book with the other. She’s still contemplating the merits of arson when she pushes back out through the door and into the parking lot, vowing never to return to that awful place and yet mourning having to add to her already overflowing drawer of Things Not to Think About.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she pulls the sweatshirt out of the wash that evening, having begrudgingly followed Rio’s advice, there is no trace of her coffee left behind. Almost like it had never happened at all.

    <p>
     Even beneath the harsh spray of the pressure washer, the muck refuses to budge. Agatha stands patiently still on the front porch, intent on her task until finally the grime gives way. The hum of the engine vibrates the wooden slats beneath her old yard work sneakers, her mind lulled into a focused calm by the rhythmic, thoughtless task.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now that March is well underway and the world is starting to thaw, the growing list of chores that Agatha’s been putting off can no longer be ignored, driving her to dedicate her entire Saturday to shrinking her to-do list.
    </p>
    <p>
     Luckily there’s no need for her to break out the lawnmower quite yet with the grass just barely starting to come back to life, but months of dirt and grime have seemingly been pressed into every crevice of her house’s facade by the winter’s relentless snow and frigid rain.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the cushion covers for the rocking chairs nearly done in the wash and the porch railing thoroughly scrubbed, her final– and most time consuming– task is pressure washing the porch itself, restoring the wood to its usual soft shine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even in her worst moments, Agatha has never been able to let the house fall into disrepair. Even though it’s twice as many chores as it used to be. Maybe it’s because, subconsciously, she’s still waiting for Nicky to come home and she wants it to look how he remembers it. Or maybe that’s just what the shrink she’d briefly tried out had suggested after Agatha complained to him about having to figure out how to plant the right flowers in the garden and keep them alive. She’d stopped seeing him not long after.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Agatha just wants to live in a clean fucking house, thank you very much.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s lost in the tangle of her thoughts– that asshat therapist, moving the laundry to the dryer, Nicky– and doesn’t catch that she has a visitor until she pauses the spray to check the timer on her phone, nearly jumping out of her skin when she turns and sees a figure out of the corner of her eye. Thankfully, Agatha’s sense of dignity keeps her both rigid and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her neighbor from the house at the end of the street, Wanda Maximoff, stands at the foot of the brick porch steps, just out of range of Agatha’s pressure washer. Her hands are stuffed into the pockets of her red zip up jacket, a pair of perfectly unscuffed tennis shoes peeking out from beneath her black yoga pants. Clearly she must have been in the middle of some sort of power walk, though not a single strand of auburn hair has escaped from her ponytail. A small, almost shy smile plays at her lips as she pulls one hand free to wiggle her fingers in greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They had been something almost like friends, once. But that was a long time ago, and Agatha’s not sure she’d be willing to admit such a thing even under threat of violence. Wanda’s boys are only two years younger than Nicky was, Agatha remembers, and she finds her thoughts almost slipping away to think of what they must look like now, closing in on double digits. She snaps herself back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you need something?” Agatha calls bluntly over the drone of the pressure washer, unwilling to turn it off and accidentally seem willing to socialize. Wanda rolls her eyes, but her smile doesn’t drop.
    </p>
    <p>
     That’s the thing about Wanda, Agatha thinks. She’s a persistent bitch. She had tried to come around after Nicky died, offering a warm embrace at his funeral and home cooked meals silently left at the front door with small, encouraging notes in the weeks after.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda had tried to come by when Rio left too, noticing the clear absence of the Subaru in the driveway and knocking on Agatha’s door to see if she was alright. Agatha had ignored her every time, crumpling her notes without reading them and avoiding eye contact when they passed one another on the sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t want to hear Wanda offer her empty platitudes or scold her for being a recluse behind the guise of pity. She didn’t want to hear about Vision’s misadventures at work or how her boys were doing in school. Wanda had eventually taken the hint and stopped trying. Or so Agatha had thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I haven’t seen you around in a while, and it’s harder for you to ignore me when I’m actually in front of you,” Wanda calls back, undeterred by Agatha’s harsh tone. If anything, she looks pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Agatha sniffs, placing her free hand on her hip. Wanda’s smile only grows and she pulls her other hand out of her pocket, beginning to count on her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Really? Because if I recall, you ignored the notes that I left, the texts I sent, my calls, dozens of attempts to say hello on the sidewalk, holiday party invites–” Agatha cuts her off with a groan, finally flicking the engine off and throwing the tool down, striding to stand at the top of the stairs. She crosses her arms and stares down at Wanda.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fine, you’ve got my attention. What do you want?” Wanda puts her hands back in her pockets, rocking on her toes. The picture of innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want to hang out. I figured we could catch up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha barks an incredulous laugh at her. “No. Absolutely not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, Wanda doesn’t waver.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I thought you might say that. So I came prepared to bargain,” Wanda shrugs, like Agatha has forced her hand. Agatha merely lifts a brow, waiting. When Wanda’s polite smile turns sharper, she knows well enough to be nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha Harkness, if you do not spend the afternoon with me right now I will have no choice but to tell the Boy Scouts
     <em>
      and
     </em>
     the Girl Scouts to put your house back into their door-to-door sales rotation.” At Agatha’s shocked face, Wanda’s eyes seem to sparkle with pride.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Bet you never stopped to wonder how you’d gotten away with such blissful silence these past few years, did you? Don’t make me take it away.” Agatha gets herself together, narrowing her eyes at Wanda.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You wouldn’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda clicks her tongue. “You know I would.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They stand at a stalemate, tension far too palpable for a Saturday in suburbia pulling the moment taut. Finally, the alarm on Agatha’s phone goes off, signaling that the laundry is ready to be moved. She sighs, pinching the bridge of her nose between her thumb and pointer finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Which would be worse– several uninterrupted hours alone with her bubbly neighbor, or a barrage of children in wrinkled uniforms pounding on her door all year and begging her to spend her hard earned money on overpriced garbage? Agatha turns the alarm off with a long suffering sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, Wanda. Come on in.”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Agatha turns the knob on the dryer, closing her eyes and taking a deep breath as it rocks to life. She can do this– sit here and listen to Wanda babble about whatever she wants for an hour or two and then fake a headache and kick her out. Easy.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she gets back down the stairs and into the living room, she’s surprised to find Wanda isn’t there. Instead she’s standing in the kitchen in front of the fridge, holding both doors open and wearing a contemplative frown on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Looking for anything in particular?” Agatha asks, disbelieving her clear lack of boundaries. Instead of having the decency to look embarrassed, Wanda simply turns to look at her with the same expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was hoping to find literally anything other than whatever mold experiment you’ve got growing in that tupperware in the back,” Wanda says, wrinkling her nose. She shuts the fridge, but not before pulling out the bottle of wine sitting in the door and setting it on the counter near Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Pour us some of this, would you? I’m going to order food from that Chinese place you like,” she says, not even looking up as she pulls out her phone and starts tapping away. Agatha feels torn between her annoyance at being bossed around in her own home and being genuinely impressed by Wanda’s complete refusal to abide by any of the rules of polite society.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha does as she’s told and pulls two glasses down from the cabinet, giving them each a healthy pour and handing one to Wanda just as she wraps up the order on her phone and pockets the device once more. Wanda offers a bright, genuine smile as she takes the glass from Agatha’s hand, clinking their drinks together before taking a sip. Agatha opens her mouth to speak but Wanda beats her to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you remember the time Sharon tried to host a book club and you and I went just to get drunk off of the fancy ass wine she keeps in her cellar? She asked you what you thought about Moby Dick and you said ‘honestly, Sharon, I don’t know anyone named Moseby and I certainly don’t know a thing about dick.’ She was so mad she almost cried and I think I actually pissed myself laughing,” Wanda recounts, slurring her words while she quotes Agatha and grinning into her drink.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s lips twitch up of their own accord, the use of the muscles feeling strange after so long. It feels almost nice to hear Wanda talk about the way that she used to be, loud and brash and unapologetic. But she hasn’t been that person in years. Still unapologetic, certainly, but now her sharpness isn’t blunted behind her wit. Now she’s all teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you not have a life to get back to? Kids and a husband and probably some yappy little dog? Why are you really here?” Agatha asks, her words coming out more tired than she would like. She waits for Wanda to drop the act and confess that she feels bad for not monitoring Agatha more closely or that she had seen her on the porch when she walked by and couldn’t help but feel pity. It never comes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t be a bitch,” Wanda replies breezily, leaning back against the counter and making herself comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Excuse me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Excused. I’ve given you space and time, thinking maybe you just needed to ride some things out on your own for a bit before coming back. But I see now that that was never your plan. Whatever dreams you had of becoming some fucked up urban legend type are officially over,” she announces with an air of finality before looking Agatha dead in the eyes, suddenly serious.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can’t keep everyone out forever, Agatha. You can’t keep
     <em>
      me
     </em>
     out forever.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffs at Wanda’s audacity, her insistence that she matters here in some way. That any of this is about her at all. Agatha takes a sip of her wine before pinning her with an icy glare.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can tell yourself whatever helps you sleep better at night, Maximoff, but I’ve only agreed to one afternoon of this shit. Unless you’ve got more bribes up your sleeve, this is all the time you’re going to get,” Agatha tells her, voice cool and indifferent. Wanda merely shrugs, tossing back her wine and pouring herself more.
    </p>
    <p>
     The food arrives not long after and Wanda goes to the door to retrieve it, thanking the delivery man with a smile before carrying the hefty paper bag to the living room, setting it proudly on the coffee table. Wanda maneuvers through the space like she belongs, like this sort of thing is something that they do together often and not something Agatha has been forced into at metaphorical gunpoint. Resigned to her fate, Agatha moves to the couch, sinking into the plush sofa and watching Wanda unpack everything.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman has ordered a veritable feast– hot containers of orange chicken, lo mein, veggie fried rice and wonton soup among other things litter the wooden surface, filling the room with warm, mouth-watering aromas as Wanda cracks each of them open.
    </p>
    <p>
     They don’t bother with getting plates, instead leaning across the coffee table to reach everything and picking bites from the various containers. It reminds Agatha of her early twenties, a lifetime ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     To Agatha’s surprise and relief, Wanda doesn’t talk about her kids, or the past, or Rio, or any of the other gargantuan elephants that Agatha skirts around. She catches Agatha up on neighborhood gossip, like so-and-so getting fined by the HOA for tanning topless in their front yard and Sharon accidentally driving her car through her own garage door when she thought she was in reverse.
    </p>
    <p>
     Loose from the wine and a full stomach, Agatha lets herself lower her defenses a bit and relax. By the time Wanda tells her about Ralph falling off of a float and breaking his arm while playing Santa in the Christmas parade, Agatha laughs so hard that she snorts.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound feels foreign to her ears, her own joy startling her out of her relaxed state. Agatha thinks to be embarrassed, to pull the wall right back up, but Wanda is just laughing along with her, entirely unaware of Agatha’s internal battle. She feels lighter, then, even if only slightly. A rock or two lifted from the pile on her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment passes and their laughter dies down, and Agatha watches as Wanda prods at a piece of chicken with her chopsticks, her expression turning serious in a way that Agatha can’t read. Very quietly, in a small, unsure voice that Agatha doesn’t think she’s ever heard her use, she confesses, “I used to have a brother. A twin.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They’ve never discussed Wanda’s childhood before and Agatha has never pressed, mostly because she has never wanted to risk talking about her own. Even now, Agatha does not prod. Wanda turns her head, staring past her through the window and out into the backyard.
    </p>
    <p>
     “He was the only family that I had left. In my eyes, he held the world in his hands. Even when we had nothing, he made me feel like no dream was too big for me to chase.” Wanda’s eyebrows pinch together, but still she doesn’t look at Agatha, clearly lost in memory. Agatha doesn’t notice she’s stopped breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “When he died, it was like everything good and safe in the world had died with him. There had never been a version of me that existed without Pietro, and I didn’t want there to be.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally Wanda looks back at her. There’s something unguarded in her eyes– something raw that Agatha’s never seen. It reminds her of that thing she can see in Rio that nobody else seems to, like she’s been shattered and glued back together again but not all of the pieces are in the right spots anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha feels like she’s peeking behind the curtain at something that was not meant for her eyes, but Wanda doesn’t waver or back down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Soon, I will have been grieving him for longer than he was ever alive. Pietro was dead long before the boys were born– before I ever met Vision, even. Nobody in my life knew him but me, so his loss is a weight I’ve always had to carry alone. I can’t help but wonder sometimes if it would’ve been any easier if there had been just one other person that understood.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha knows, of course, what Wanda is saying. Knows the weight of her words and sees the act of surrender in shedding the outer layers of her skin to show Agatha her soft, vulnerable center. She swallows, searching for the right thing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sure he’d be very proud of you. Of the life you’ve built,” she offers, the words sounding lame and inadequate to her own ears. But Wanda reaches over with shimmering eyes to take Agatha’s hand in her own, squeezing it tightly before letting it drop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda breathes like she’s gathering herself back together, and just like that she’s back to her casual, lighthearted demeanor. She pushes up from the couch, taking both of their wine glasses to the kitchen and setting them in the sink before returning, standing across the table from where Agatha sits.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha is relieved to see the sort of quiet tranquility back on Wanda’s face. She almost forgets that she’s supposed to be annoyed to have her here.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You should come on a walk with me some time,” she says. And then, as if reading Agatha’s mind, she adds, “or the other option is for me to keep showing up here unannounced and forcing you to spend indefinite amounts of time with me like this. Your choice!” Her voice is a happy chirp, intentionally pitched up to get on Agatha’s nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grumbles out some sort of noncommittal agreement and Wanda bids her a polite goodbye in return, letting herself out and returning the house to its usual quiet. Agatha pushes the noodles in front of her around with her chopsticks and notes with a look at her watch that three hours have passed. Begrudgingly, she admits to herself that it hadn’t been
     <em>
      entirely
     </em>
     awful to have another living person in her house for a bit with no obvious ulterior motives at play.
    </p>
    <p>
     She gathers the takeout containers and seals them shut before piling them in the fridge, hoping she’ll remember to eat at least some of them before they go bad. Agatha rinses the wine glasses out in the sink and washes her hands, letting her mind wander.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tries to picture a man with Wanda’s face, handsome and bright, maybe a redhead or a brunette. She wonders how Wanda might be different if he had lived– if she would have still come by today and made all of those attempts to reach out, or if she wouldn’t have been so persistent without the steady thrum of her own grief to remind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wonders, for the first time, if maybe other people also feel a bit like an unforgivable monster, trapped in their own towers built from the nightmarish memories that they can’t escape. Maybe they’re all just doing a better job at hiding it than she is.
    </p>
    <p>
     She clears the thought with a shake of her head. It must be the wine talking, she decides. Just stupid tipsy sentimentality that will surely be banished with a good old fashioned couch nap.

    <p>
     When Agatha wakes to a knock at her door the sun has already set, leaving the living room lit only by the moonlight falling through the windows and pooling on the floor. She rubs blearily at her eyes with the heels of her palms, trying to orient herself. Checking her watch, she sees it’s already close to seven. Her couch nap had turned into a bit of a couch sleep, it seems.
    </p>
    <p>
     The remnants of a dream pull at her mind on its way out– she had been chasing something, running after it with all of her might to no avail. A flash of green ahead of her in a forest and just out of reach, roots and vines catching on her legs and face as she crashed through. The pieces make no sense to Agatha as they fade, but the lingering frustration stays in her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     The knock comes again, a relentless pounding against the wood of the door that aggravates Agatha’s quickly forming headache. Wanda must have forgotten something earlier and come back for it, but Jesus
     <em>
      Christ
     </em>
     did she have to be so intense about it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stands from the couch, pushing the hair back from her face and straightening out her oversized t-shirt with a tug, still dressed in her yard work clothes. She walks through the house and throws the door open without sparing a glance, launching straight into her tirade.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda, what could you
     <em>
      possibly
     </em>
     –” Agatha stops in the middle of her sentence when her brain finally catches up to what her eyes have found. It’s not Wanda at her door, but Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stands with her fist still raised, dressed in a navy suit like she’s just come from work even though it’s a Saturday night and clutching a briefcase in her right hand. Agatha is so confused by the whole scene that she forgets her snark and instead wonders if she’s still dreaming on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     She doesn’t fight it when Rio simply pushes in past her, not stopping to take off her black pumps in the entryway like she’s supposed to and instead curving straight to the dining room, where she sets the briefcase down on the table and begins spinning the combination lock with her thumb until it clicks open.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha closes the door and follows her dumbly, stopping in the archway between the dining room and the foyer to watch her pull a stack of papers out of a manila folder. She doesn’t get any further than the
     <em>
      what
     </em>
     in
     <em>
      what the actual fuck are you doing right now
     </em>
     before Rio cuts her off, speaking at last.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There’s a class action lawsuit against the fertility clinic.” Her voice is serious, taking on an almost frenzied edge as she spreads the papers from the folder out on the wood, sliding them away from herself and toward the end of the table closest to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha already feels on edge, first from her afternoon with Wanda and now Rio’s baffling entrance. This is not how they do things– Rio is supposed to show up calm, vulnerable but still calculated. They don’t talk about things that are real and they certainly do not wear this much clothing for this long. Rio seems to be sweating slightly, nearly manic with whatever she’s trying to say. Agatha finds it off putting, like she’s not entirely sure what to expect from her now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Never one to lose her composure, Agatha takes two tentative steps forward and squints down at the papers, trying in vain to decipher the print without the help of her glasses. Rio, of course, catches her struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Multiple families that used sperm or egg donors from the Perlman Clinic have reported health issues with their kids. They think that the clinic has been intentionally failing to report abnormal test results from donors’ genetic screening panels so they could add them to their bank anyway Or maybe even foregoing the testing entirely and bullshitting the results.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stops then, holding herself rigid while she clenches and unclenches her fists mechanically. Agatha can see her pulse jumping in her throat, like she’s ready to vibrate out of her skin. Agatha leans forward, gripping the back of the nearest dining chair until her knuckles turn white while she lets herself fully absorb what she’s hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The clinic. The donors and their potential unreported genetic abnormalities. The words the doctors had said to her that had washed over her like white noise, none of it actually making any sense until days later.
     <em>
      A genetic trigger. Nothing that they could have caught in time, even if they’d known where to look.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     His little body still in his dinosaur pajamas, looking more small and fragile than she’d ever seen on the sterile hospital bed between them, getting colder and colder as the minutes ticked by. The way that the hospital staff had gently tried to prod them into letting him go and Rio had blown up so spectacularly that Agatha had almost been concerned that they would call the police. Instead, they had apologized profusely, leaving Agatha and Rio alone with him for the rest of the night. No one blames a grieving mother, she had learned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other memories try to slip in through the gap that the first has left open, clawing viciously at the back of her mind. Agatha squeezes her eyes shut, unwilling to live them all out again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It would help if we joined them. If we told his story,” Rio says softly, her voice full of conviction. Rage balloons and explodes so quickly inside of Agatha’s chest that the snarl that rips free from her almost comes as a shock.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Absolutely the fuck not.” Her eyes fly open and find Rio’s– white hot fury meeting cool determination. Rio’s composure in the face of her rage only bolsters her desire to draw blood. Agatha releases the chair and turns toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who would it help, Rio? Your conscience? Your insatiable hero complex? Because it certainly wouldn’t help me. It certainly wouldn’t help
     <em>
      him.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha is on a tear now. Rio falters slightly, her hands curling more tightly in on themselves.
     <em>
      Good
     </em>
     . Agatha sinks her claws in further, going for the kill.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have you been fired or something? So desperate for money that you’d profit off of your son’s death like he’s some fucking data error? Some faulty equipment from a lazy manufacturer?” She hisses.
    </p>
    <p>
     “STOP IT,” Rio bellows at her, her booming voice filling the space around them. Agatha’s jaw clicks shut so fast that her teeth ache and she flinches back, so unaccustomed to hearing her take that tone. There are unshed tears welling up in Rio’s eyes and her nostrils are flared, her chest rising and falling rapidly with her shallow breaths. If Agatha didn’t know any better, she’d think someone had thrust an actual knife between her ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t you
     <em>
      ever
     </em>
     fucking talk about him like that to me again. I can take a lot of shit from you, Agatha, but not that. Never that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio is shaking. She runs her fingers through her hair, disturbing the glossy waves and leaving it wild. Agatha has the decency to keep her mouth tightly shut, swallowing her vitriol back down and letting it burn her esophagus in penance. The room is quiet as Rio calms her breathing down, waiting until she’s regulated herself before speaking again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It would help the families who still have their children, Agatha. The parents who are going to use the clinic’s donors deserve to know exactly whose DNA will be in their child. Nobody deserves what happened to Nicky. What happened to us.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha can hear the logic behind the sentiment. Truly, she understands the point Rio is trying to make and the intention behind her actions. Still, she can’t let it go. She can’t articulate why either, not without showing her carefully held cards.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, she settles on a mumbled “we don’t even know if it was the donor’s fault.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This, of course, is the worst possible thing she could say. Reaching her whole hand into the gaping, infected wound they share and pawing tactlessly at its gory center.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio recoils as if slapped, her eyes widening in horror. Agatha wonders if Rio must spend all of her time trying not to think about it too, furiously swimming away from the whirlpool– not to gain any true distance, but to avoid being sucked even further down into its mouth. Here she is anyway, tying rocks to both of their ankles and sending them careening into the inky waters.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know what Agatha?” Rio starts, pausing to prod at the inside of her cheek with her tongue when her voice cracks on the words. “You’re right.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Somewhere inside of Agatha, a door slams shut, rattling on its hinges. The force of it ricochets through the hollow space where her heart used to sit. But Rio keeps talking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We shouldn’t have used my egg. Even though I passed all of the tests it was still a risk we shouldn’t have taken, not knowing anything about my family history. I forced your hand when I knew you were nervous, and now our son is dead. So you’re right, and I’ll never for a moment not feel that guilt.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Silent tears slide down Rio’s cheeks and the broken look in her eyes is on full display for Agatha, the depths of her agony laid bare. Agatha feels like the whole world has shifted on its axis and they’ve been thrown into some new version of reality where everything is hideously wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because the words Rio is saying make no sense at all. The concept is so unimaginable she almost wonders if she’s begun to hallucinate, if the wine she’d had earlier was so long expired it had turned lethal. She tugs at the thousands of thoughts running through her mind but none of them untangle long enough to become words that make it to her mouth. Agatha tries anyway, parting her lips in hopes that something makes it through.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, that’s not what–” but Rio just holds up a hand, silencing her. Her lips press together and Agatha watches her jaw work for a moment while she waits with bated breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do not want to talk about this,” Rio intones, her voice surprisingly steady. “I do not give a fuck about being the monster in your narrative anymore. This is about him. Not you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her tone drips with condescension as she seals herself off, putting her armor back on and brandishing her weapon. At the sight, Agatha forgets her moment of empathy. Her anger returns in full to replace it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Today was supposed to be simple– chores, check marks on her to-do list, maybe some shitty TV and a hot shower before bed. Not an attack from Wanda, or a wine-induced stress dream, or Rio showing up not to fuck but to commit an act of terrorism. All of it burns beneath her skin like a thousand miniscule cuts, making it hard to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
     She meets Rio’s eyes, which are back to being unreadable. Unforgiving. “Get out,” she whispers. The fight has drained out of them both and Rio merely nods, like it’s what she was expecting Agatha to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio returns the empty folder to her briefcase and clicks it shut, leaving the stack of papers on the table. She slides the bag back into her hand, straightening her posture and flicking her hair back off of her shoulders, pulling herself back together manually.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, Agatha. I’m meeting with the lawyer and the lead plaintiffs next month to hear where they’re at with the case so far. The details are in there,” she says, gesturing toward the pages. “You don’t have to come, but I think you should.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She doesn’t look back at Agatha as she breezes past, the smell of her perfume lingering even as the sound of her heels on the hardwood echoes back to the foyer and out the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stands still, watching the space where Rio had been standing until she hears the car engine come to life outside and roll back down the driveway. It feels as though her skin has been unzipped and all of the shattered mosaic pieces inside of her have been left scattered on the floor, their jagged edges waiting to dig into the meat of her palms when she sweeps them up again.
    </p>
    <p>
     When it feels like she can breathe normally again, Agatha retrieves her glasses from the living room and walks back to the table, sifting through the papers with shaking hands. Rio’s words echo back in her head, about how there are other children to help. Other parents who could have the chance to know that their baby is sick.
    </p>
    <p>
     She thinks of her beautiful boy in the only suit that he owned, pale and gaunt in a casket, and how maybe if someone had raised an alarm flag sooner there could’ve been a different outcome. Agatha knows it’s far-fetched, but still the idea refuses to leave her mind, turning over and over again like a river-smoothed stone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Carefully, she shuffles the pages back into a neat stack before carrying and depositing them into the tray on her kitchen counter filled with old birthday and Christmas cards, receipts and gift cards and keys she couldn’t match to their locks if she tried. A place where pending things go until she can make a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a sigh, Agatha forces her tired body up the stairs and drags herself into the shower, letting the scalding water stream over her skin while she presses her forehead to the cool tile wall. Letting the final dregs of her anger simmer out and slither down the drain.
    </p>
    <p>
     She doesn’t understand why Rio would do this– show up at her door with those papers, evangelizing to her about the lawsuit like she could sway Agatha’s mind. Like they were still some sort of team. And then to yell, turning herself into the perfect picture of righteous indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
     What was she expecting? This is all that they do– they fight and they fuck, in that order. Or at least they
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     . Now Rio hadn’t come around since November, and then tonight she’d left without even grazing Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     That can be fine, Agatha decides, letting her muscles finally relax beneath the water. Rio doesn’t have to fuck her anymore if she doesn’t want to. The world will keep spinning, she tells herself. It’s probably for the best.
    </p>
    <p>
     With her decision made, Agatha pushes back off of the shower wall and gets to the task of washing her body, soaping down her chest and arms, pointedly ignoring how sensitive her nipples are when her fingers slip over them.
     <em>
      Just the body reacting to a pattern
     </em>
     , she tells herself.
     <em>
      A Pavlovian response
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But when Agatha gets to the slick heat at the apex of her thighs, her ministrations come to a stuttering halt. Her clit throbs from the barest brush of pressure and she closes her eyes against the sensation, biting her lip to hold in the moan that threatens to leave her.
     <em>
      Just the body reacting to a pattern.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it would be for the best, a way to get her mind off of her fucked up day and release some of the tension.
     <em>
      It doesn’t have to be anything more than that
     </em>
     . The notion momentarily soothes the voice in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha uses the lull to bring her right hand back up to her breast, kneading the flesh indulgently before pinching her nipple between her fingers and tugging, this time not caring to suppress her moan. Her hips cant forward of their own volition, and she obliges by sliding her left hand back between her legs. A gasp passes through her lips when she feels just how wet she is, her fingers gliding through her folds with no resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha parts herself with two fingers, dragging her middle finger from her entrance up through her slit to gather the wetness pooled there and spread it up to the bundle of nerves. She whimpers at the touch, expertly circling her clit and reveling in the heat blooming low in her stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unbidden, the image of Rio standing at the door in her suit flashes in her mind’s eye– the exposed skin of her throat beneath the collar of her blouse and her strong fingers wrapped around the handle of her briefcase.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      No
     </em>
     ,” Agatha says aloud to herself, her voice harsh in the quiet of the bathroom. Her body seems to disagree, though, as a fresh wave of wetness gushes forward and starts to drip down her thighs. Her clit throbs beneath her touch at the thought of those strong fingers inside of her.
     <em>
      No no no no no.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shuts her eyes tightly, forcibly clearing the image from her mind and trying to draw something else forth instead, something safe like porn or Cate Blanchett in a suit or even just the concept of fucking a stranger in a bar bathroom. But they never come.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, her mind supplies other ideas– Rio’s hands where hers are now, Rio’s tongue pressing into her cunt, Rio’s strap taking her from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha whines both in frustration and at her mounting orgasm, moving her left hand from her clit to press two fingers to her entrance and thrusting in at a punishing pace, hoping to lose herself to the sensation. She lets her other hand fall from her breast to her neglected clit, rubbing in tight, fast circles. She needs it to be over, needs her brain to stop making it worse before she enters truly dangerous territory.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Anything else
     </em>
     , she begs her brain as her stomach begins to tighten.
     <em>
      Literally anything else
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But if there’s one thing that Agatha has always known, it’s that she’s never been able to trust her body. Not really.
    </p>
    <p>
     So her brain offers its pièce de résistance with the full quality of a film playing on an IMAX screen with surround sound– Rio, writhing beneath her, hips thrashing against Agatha’s mouth as she comes apart against her tongue, her release spilling across Agatha’s face and chest and tongue and dripping down her chin. She can almost taste her, can almost hear her screaming in ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cums to the memory so hard that her legs almost give out beneath her. She locks her knees and lets her head fall forward against the wall, shaking with the aftershocks. After several long minutes, Agatha pulls her fingers back out of herself slowly with a hiss and holds them under the cooling stream, letting the evidence of what she’s done disappear from her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      It doesn’t mean anything. Just more of the Pavlov shit
     </em>
     , she reminds herself, ignoring the twisting feeling low in her gut, like the orgasm hadn’t helped her and instead had made it all worse. Shame starts to burn at her cheeks, but Agatha reminds herself that nobody has seen, nobody is here to read her thoughts. Just her and this big empty house bearing witness to her sins.
    </p>
    <p>
     She washes her hair in the now-frigid water and doesn’t make eye contact with herself in the bathroom mirror when she walks past. Agatha quickly braids her hair back with nimble fingers before letting the towel fall, leaving it crumpled on her bedroom floor as she crawls naked into the bed and pulls the covers up over her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’ll be hours before her mind lets her sleep, but she closes her eyes anyway.

    <p>
     April second arrives as a bright, quiet Sunday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Staring up to the meaningless constellations of her popcorn ceiling, Agatha listens to the gentle birdsong outside of her window, soaking in the calm before the day gets the chance to take its hold and push her beneath the waves. For now, she can tread water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Twelve years ago, Agatha gave birth in the dead of night in a hospital room that boasted an obnoxious, oversaturated wallpaper covered in little cartoon ducklings. The labor had been gruesome– nearly fourteen hours– and Rio had sat with her through every contraction, every scream, every dig of nails into her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     When it was over and her son was in her arms, Agatha was sure that God must have made a mistake in gifting him to her. He was so perfect, too precious to be stained by her touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there he was, settled against her chest, with wisps of dark hair just like Rio’s and a cherubic little nose that scrunched when he slept. Of course they’d used a donor, but Rio was adamant that he had Agatha’s eyes, her smile, her propensity for a good tantrum.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been so fucking exhausted. So obscenely, deliriously happy. Their baby, finally coming home to complete their family.
    </p>
    <p>
     After nine long months of not sleeping on her stomach and having to waddle everywhere and suddenly hating all of her favorite foods. But also after the way Rio had picked her up and spun her around the bathroom screaming when the test came back positive, and their shared tears when they’d first felt him kick.
    </p>
    <p>
     A memory rises of Rio skidding into the living room on socked feet, gap-toothed grin on full display, proclaiming that at 20 weeks along the baby could hear her talk to him now. She spent the rest of the pregnancy mumbling to him through Agatha’s belly, lips pressed to the skin to be sure he could make out every word.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tides of her grief swell at the memory like a siren song, and when Agatha pulls herself from the bed the water has already risen to her underarms. She heads downstairs, going through to motions of making herself a cup of tea. Something simple, something thoughtless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky used to demand big pancake breakfasts on his birthday, the three of them dancing around the kitchen in chaotic harmony while Agatha made sure that nothing burned. Now the only sound to be heard is the whistle of the kettle.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the quiet isn’t unwelcome, not really. It sits beside her on the counter like an old friend. Something she’s had years to grow accustomed to the feel of.
    </p>
    <p>
     Idly, she wonders what theme he would have wanted for his party this year. Something comic book themed, or maybe baseball if he had kept up with it. Or maybe middle schoolers are too cool for their parties to have themes anymore, unwilling to stoop to such childish customs. Agatha wouldn’t know. She sips at her tea.
    </p>
    <p>
     His first birthday was bunny themed because he’d seen a rabbit in a picture book from the library and had latched on, crying until they showed it to him again, running his chubby baby fingers over the glossy paper. She’d had to go back and return it just to check it out again at least five times before his obsession waned.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s not warm enough yet in Massachusetts to be considered a good day to spend outside, but the sun is shining against a cloudless blue sky, and it’s more than she’s gotten in previous years. Agatha gathers what she knows she’ll need, picking a book carefully from its designated spot and pulling an old pool towel from the linen closet before placing both in the worn tote bag she keeps by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     She throws her puffy black coat on over her white t-shirt and navy cardigan, making the last minute decision to grab an old throw blanket before heading out the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her destination isn’t far– only a few miles out of the neighborhood– and Agatha takes the journey in silence instead of fiddling with the radio. Her fancy new car has a touch screen that she’s never truly figured out how to use, too accustomed to the knobs and dials of the Subaru.
    </p>
    <p>
     Quiet, her old friend, adds to the feeling that the rest of the world is something separate today, something she doesn’t have to deal with just now. Today can belong to Nicky, like it’s supposed to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s car rolls through the gates of the cemetery and traces a familiar path to a spot beneath a broad oak tree, passing only a smattering of other cars on her way. Sundays are busier than usual with families penciling in their mourning in the slot after church.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sees the Subaru first, then the shape huddled in the grass 30 yards away in the exact spot she’s headed to. With all of her might, Agatha resists the urge to smash her face against the steering wheel and scream. She doesn’t want to navigate this minefield, or let the vicious parts of herself out of their cage today. Agatha just wants to spend time with her son.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s that thought that propels her out of the car, stopping to grab her bag from the backseat before starting down the nearest row of headstones. Today is Nicky’s day, and they’ll both respect that. She hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she gets closer, Agatha can see that Rio isn’t sitting on a blanket or towel or folding chair of any kind, just the seat of her jeans in the dirt, her knees tucked up to her chest with her arms wrapped around them. Her hair is pulled back in a loose ponytail, the wind whipping strands out and into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here, like this, she’s not the formidable business woman that Agatha’s had to deal with lately. Here, she’s Just Rio. A better opponent in some ways. Worse in others.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she reaches the spot next to her, Agatha drops her bag and bends over to pull out the towel. Rio jumps like she hadn’t noticed her approaching before sheepishly scooting over slightly– no further away from Nicky, but enough to give Agatha room to sit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lays the towel out before sitting down gingerly, wrapping her coat tighter around herself and silently thanking past-Agatha for making the choice to wear it. Out of the corner of her eye, she takes Rio in, sitting there in only a light zip up jacket over her t-shirt, the flimsy garment hanging open and nearly slipping off of one shoulder. She won’t say anything, but Agatha can see that the tip of her nose and the tops of her ears are pink, her jaw clenching against her teeth attempting to chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she looks to the headstone again, Agatha lets her eyes follow the looping letters carved into the marble, tracing the shapes more than truly reading. And then her attention snags on the bright blooms freshly laid at the base of the stone, a radiant variety of pinks and blues and yellows. All of Nicky’s favorites.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her sweet boy. Her attentive boy, who loved both of his mothers with a heart too big for his body. Who had not one but two mothers that had lost him. With a sigh, Agatha scoots to one side of the towel to make space.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Get your ass out of the dirt,” she mutters, so low that it comes out as barely more than a whisper. She knows Rio hears.
    </p>
    <p>
     Knows it because Rio whips her head to the side, wearing an expression not unlike a skittish horse being offered a sugar cube from a stranger’s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you sure? It’s fine if–”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” Agatha cuts her off, her impromptu spark of kindness fading quickly. “Shut the fuck up and come here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio unclasps her arms from around her knees long enough to scoot over and join her on the towel, though the thin fabric does little to block out the cold of the ground beneath them. She sits entirely rigid, like Agatha’s a predator she’s trying not to threaten.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ignoring the tension radiating off of Rio, Agatha leans over and pulls the old throw blanket out of the bag next, draping one side across her own lap and throwing the other at Rio to do the same. Rio blinks, caught off guard, before gently folding the fabric over her legs and fisting it in her hands. They keep as much distance as possible from the other, but even that turns out to be less than a foot of space.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally settled, Agatha goes to pull the book out of her tote but hesitates with her arm outstretched, suddenly self conscious in a way she hadn’t expected to be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because she’s always been able to do this part alone, she realizes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio and Agatha haven’t run into one another here in a long time. Not on his death date or his birthday or any of the other times Agatha comes to visit, which she is only now starting to realize might be odd. Her eyes flicker over to Rio and quickly away, not really even knowing what it is she would ask. Rio answers her anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Usually I come at the time he was born and sit with him then. But apparently they’ve been having some issues lately with teenagers coming here to drink and get high and shit like that, so they’re locking the gates at night now,” she explains with the tone of someone talking about the weather, picking absently at her nails instead of making eye contact.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha remembers how Rio used to climb out of bed and sneak into his room at the exact time listed on his birth certificate, whispering
     <em>
      happy birthday
     </em>
     to his little sleeping form and slipping right back out. Agatha had never brought it up, content to let it belong to the two of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky had been born just after one in the morning, when all of the nurses in the delivery room looked almost as exhausted as Agatha felt. Rio used to joke that she’d held him in for the extra hour and change because she didn’t want to have an April Fools baby. When little ears were not around, Agatha would remind her that having a baby is not, in fact, like taking a shit, and that even if she
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     tried to hold him in, her pelvic floor was no match for his bowling ball head.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she knows, on some level, what Rio has lost with the locking of the gate. How she must feel. Agatha almost wants to say sorry, but she’s not sure what for. Rio’s ritual with Nicky being disturbed? The fact that they have to be here together now? Every conversation they’ve had in the past three years?
    </p>
    <p>
     No, none of it feels right. None of it would be enough, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I read to him,” Agatha confesses instead, feeling both foolish and liberated by the admission. She forges on through her discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We had just started
     <em>
      The Lightning Thief
     </em>
     when he– when it happened.” She tugs at the ends of her hair. An old habit. “Every year I read him the next few chapters.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stares forward at the headstone again, if only to avoid looking over at Rio. She’s afraid of what she’ll find in those brown eyes–  probably something mocking. Or worse, something pitying.
    </p>
    <p>
     But when Agatha flicks her attention back to her, all she can see are unshed tears, sitting patiently at Rio’s waterline while she watches her own fingers run through the blades of grass near her shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a suspended moment, Rio lets out a watery sigh. “Have you guys gotten to the tunnel of love yet?” She asks, turning her eyes up to meet Agatha’s curious gaze. “It’s my favorite part.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha feels the corners of her lips twitch up despite herself. She pulls the book from her bag, thumbing through the well worn pages to find where she’d dog eared their spot. Scanning the start of the chapter, she gives a nod, letting her fingers glide over the ink.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re in luck. We’re just about there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     When she looks up, Rio’s eyes are already on her, waiting. Confusion pulls at her for a second before she realizes Rio is waiting for her to start.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha takes in her audience– first glancing to the headstone and then back to rio, chin resting on her knees, red rimmed eyes looking emptily at the flowers she undoubtedly brought him today. She starts reading.
    </p>
    <p>
     They sit like that for what must be hours, the quiet but sure cadence of Agatha’s voice carrying through the air, accompanied every now and again by the sounds of birds moving through the trees or cars coming and going. Rio listens in enraptured silence until finally Agatha reaches the end of the chapter, folding down the corner of her page and closing the book before dropping it into her lap with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s throat stings from the exertion, but she realizes she feels a little lighter than she had this morning. The water is lower now, only waist high, the threat of drowning out of sight for now.
    </p>
    <p>
     A squirrel runs up a nearby oak in the late afternoon sunlight, chattering and spiraling up the wide trunk. The moment is shattered by Agatha’s stomach growling loudly, disturbing the peace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s lips curl slightly and she looks over to Agatha with one eyebrow raised. But it doesn’t feel malicious– it feels silly, reminiscent of a different place and time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want to grab something to eat?” Rio asks. There is no trace of reluctance in her words, nothing to give away that it would be out of the ordinary. Maybe she’s forgotten who they are.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha has not forgotten and she tenses, an animal ready to flee. Rio’s face lights up in belated shock, like she’s finally heard herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean– sorry– we don’t have to talk or anything. You don’t even have to look at me, if you don’t want. I just…” she tapers off, tucking the loose hair by her eyes back behind her ear, doing nothing to hide her nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want to do something that I think would make him happy. Or proud of us, I guess,” Rio finishes, her voice growing quieter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking at her, Agatha muses that this might be the longest conversation that they’ve had since his death with nobody screaming or crying or taking their clothes off. It’s exactly as excruciating as she thought it’d be.
    </p>
    <p>
     It would be best, certainly, not to tempt fate. To leave well enough alone. But when Agatha doesn’t give an answer right away, she witnesses the heartbreakingly miraculous act of Rio shrinking before her very eyes, curving in on herself until she’s something smaller, something less whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nevermind, just forget about it. It was a stupid idea,” she mumbles into her knees, drawing in a deep breath and shuffling like she’s preparing to get up from beneath the blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
     It would be best not to tempt fate, but Agatha has never been one to do what was best. Just what she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio freezes, looking at her out of the corner of her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s what I just said. Are you a parrot?” Rio’s lips merely curve into a shy smile. Something closer to relief than joy.
    </p>
    <p>
     They settle on a diner not far away, and Rio folds the blanket while Agatha rolls up the towel. They work in silence, depositing the items back into Agatha’s tote and walking side by side back to the curb.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio offers her a tentative wave before they climb into their own cars and drive back out through the gates.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The drive to the diner is brief, but long enough that Agatha’s bubble of impulsivity has burst and she’s starting to wonder what the fuck she’s done by agreeing to this. She parks her sedan in the back of the lot and cuts the engine, giving herself a moment to gather her thoughts before facing whatever’s waiting for her inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Across the lot, the big block letters of the restaurant’s sign light up in the window of the glass door, faded almost a pastel pink from their original red. Agatha can see patrons dining in the booths through the big front windows that they’re pressed up against, nearly everything about the establishment unchanged from when she’d first visited.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha and Rio had decided on a day trip out of the city, desperate to get away from campus and the strain of studying for midterms. The two of them couldn’t have been older than 19, and if she remembers right, they’d been dating for just under a year.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had driven them out of the city at random, refusing to use any sort of GPS despite Agatha’s insistence. Rio drummed her fingers across Agatha’s thigh to the beat of the ABBA song vibrating through the stereo with one hand, settling the other low on the steering wheel while she drove.
    </p>
    <p>
     The road had led them to a small but lively town no more than an hour and a half away, and they’d spent the day exploring its storefronts and niche local attractions. The decision to stop at the roadside diner before heading back was made on a whim, born mostly from a joke that it looked like something out of a cheesy Americana movie.
    </p>
    <p>
     The toes of Agatha’s shoes just barely scraped the ground beneath the tall booth, her long hair curling over her shoulders and blanketing her arms when she peered down at the big glossy menu. They probably looked like two runaways– Agatha in her thin white tank top with a small embroidered snoopy on the front and Rio in a tight black workout top that showed the silhouette of her truly excessive muscularity and a pair of loose grey sweats.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her raven hair was short enough then for the ends to curl up around her ears, doing nothing to hide the hickey that turned the entire right side of her neck purple-blue. Agatha wore a matching bruise, though it was only barely visible beneath the hem of her denim cutoffs.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pretended to scan the menu, watching Rio beneath her eyelashes as she balled up the paper wrapper from her straw. The orange vinyl booth creaked beneath her when she shifted her weight, and her focus was broken when she heard the click of the waitress’ heels on the yellow-grey linoleum coming towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The coffee that she held aloft on a tray smelled so strong that Agatha knew she was going to hate it before the mugs were even on the table. Without a word, Rio took Agatha’s mug and slid it over from where the waitress placed it, meticulously adding the perfect ratio of cream and sugar and mixing until she was satisfied before sliding it back to Agatha’s waiting hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I love you
     </em>
     , Agatha thought, though not for the first time. That was the first time she really thought she would say it, parting her lips and everything.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the moment shifted– the couple in the booth behind them began to have an obnoxiously loud fight– and instead she watched as Rio wrinkled her nose to hold in a snort of laughter when one of them accused the other of something particularly ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s heart cracked open in her chest. She wanted to freeze them in that moment, sat together in the shitty diner with its too-strong coffee and the brush of their knees beneath the table forever, giggling endlessly at that couple's absurdity. Most of all, she wanted Rio to know that she loved her in the big, all-consuming, ‘fuck the rest’ sort of way that she used to think only existed in movies. Still, the words couldn’t seem to find their way out of her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had looked over, catching her eye and giving her that devastating lopsided grin– that gap-toothed smile that felt like being let in on a secret– and Agatha released a breath she hadn’t known she was holding.
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn’t matter that she couldn’t say it right then, or even if she never could. Rio knew anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha crashes back into reality with the force of a semi truck, her hands gripping the wheel so tightly that her knuckles have turned white. This was the exact sort of thing that she shouldn’t be indulging in, the sort of thing that she had burned out of her heart and then sealed off the ashes of.
    </p>
    <p>
     She finds her own eyes in the rearview mirror, holding that icy gaze.
     <em>
      You’re not that girl anymore
     </em>
     , the voice in her head reminds her, scraping the words against the walls of her skull like loose gravel. Not the girl who was moon-eyed and wanting, content with thinking that the universe would grant her nice things if only she could stick out the bad ones.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, the woman she is now can’t feel a single goddamn thing more strongly than she feels the fear that the other shoe is going to drop, that things may yet find some impossible way to get worse the moment she lets her guard down. The terror of it rattles her teeth, follows her into every dream.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hot on its heels is the anger. Always the rage, waiting to swallow her down its fire coated throat, reminding Agatha what was taken from her. Of how she knows, deep down, that it was her fault. Even if she didn’t know it then, she sure as hell knows it now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looses a shaky exhale. She can’t sit in this diner with Rio and play happy couple, happy family. What they’d already done today had been nice enough, hadn’t it? Agatha had shared her ritual and avoided sinking her teeth or her claws into anything fragile, and Rio had let her have her time with Nicky without interfering.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had both been there for him– the three of them celebrating his birthday together for the first time in four years. Nicky would have understood, maybe, with all of his 12-year-old wisdom, that some things were just too unbearable for her to endure.
    </p>
    <p>
     A knock against her driver’s side window makes Agatha jump, shocked out of her own thoughts and back into her body once more. She turns her head to find Rio, standing hunched over so that her face is visible to Agatha through the glass, supporting her weight with a palm against the roof of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
     More time must have passed than she thought– a quick glance to the dash confirms she’s been parked for nearly half an hour. Rio points, motioning for Agatha to roll the window down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitates. It would be easier to just put her car back in drive and tear out of the lot, leaving Rio standing here to deal with the rest of the day on her own. But Agatha’s carefully constructed, arguably impenetrable steel wall won’t seem to build itself back to full height no matter how hard she tugs at it. Resigned to her fate, Agatha reasons she can do Rio the courtesy of saying
     <em>
      no thank you
     </em>
     before speeding off into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     She reaches over and presses the button on the door, rolling her window to half height and schooling her face into cool neutrality. It doesn’t matter, though. Rio has already seen her. Seen right through her, more like.
    </p>
    <p>
     The smile Rio offers is sad and doesn’t quite meet her eyes, but Agatha finds no anger there. No regret. She holds up a brown paper bag that Agatha hadn’t noticed before, the bottom sagging beneath the weight of its contents and boasting a slight grease stain.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I ordered your usual to go. Figured it beats whatever you have in the fridge,” she says, offering a slight shrug like the entire situation is casual.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something in Agatha’s chest constricts at the gesture, a sharp echo of an old feeling. Rio’s eyes don’t waver from her face as Agatha lets the silence hang, just holding that same weight. The same quiet, steady knowing that says
     <em>
      I am going to fix your coffee how you like it before it ever reaches your hands. I ordered your usual because I know you weren’t ready for this and because I know you have no food at home.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shifts uncomfortably against her leather car seat. She hates it, more than anything, that she feels more naked now than she does with Rio’s hands on her bare skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     She grits her teeth and rolls her eyes noncommittally at the gesture, but pushes the button to roll the window the rest of the way down so that Rio can hand her the bag. Agatha takes it and sets it on the passenger seat, but when she turns back Rio is reaching out of her line of sight for something else.
    </p>
    <p>
     She straightens and offers her second gift– Agatha’s faded purple cardigan, neatly folded and freshly washed. It smells overwhelmingly like Rio– jasmine and clean soap and
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     – and Agatha uses all of her might to beat back every instinct to press it against her nose before setting it on the seat next to the bag. She leaves a careful gap between the two, not wanting the greasy diner food smell to taint the fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turns back to Rio again, her finger hovering over the button and one eyebrow raised as if to say
     <em>
      , well?
     </em>
     In a gentler universe, Rio would take the hint and scamper off before Agatha’s resolve gives out and she does something stupid like weep or scream or throw a punch. In this one, she does no such thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think the theme for his party this year would be Percy Jackson, since he’s twelve in the first book,” is what she says instead. Agatha feels her tongue go leaden in her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know middle schoolers probably don’t really do themed stuff anymore, but I think maybe he would have. Don’t you?” Rio’s lips curl up in a soft, private smile as she breaks away from Agatha’s eyes to look down toward the concrete, her mind somewhere far away. When she looks back up, the smile is still there, a mischief Agatha hasn’t seen in years sparkling in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I don’t think he’d pick a Greek god to be his secret parent and give him awesome powers. I think he’d just tell everyone they’re from you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio holds Agatha’s gaze for a moment before she leans back, giving the roof of Agatha’s car a final pat as she straightens up and brushes her hands on her jeans.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Get home safe, Agatha.
     <em>
      Te veo
     </em>
     ,” she says in parting, turning and walking back across the lot to where her car must be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rolling her window up with shaky fingers, Agatha tilts her head back against the headrest to fight back against the stinging in her eyes. She wonders if this is some long game Rio is playing, some fucked up ploy to whip Agatha into a heightened emotional state just to watch her shatter all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe their usual sadistic cycle isn’t enough for her anymore and she’s looking for new games to play. Or it’s revenge, maybe, for what Agatha had said when she’d last come over.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha mulls it over so intensely that she feels the beginnings of a tension headache pressing in at her temples, prompting her to leave it alone. Whatever it is that Rio’s doing, Agatha decides that she refuses to play along. She’ll stay on her side of town, and with no big anniversaries coming up they won’t run into one another at the cemetery either.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio will slink back to her door sooner or later and Agatha will get them back on track, no more of this extracurricular contact. She exhales through her nose, relaxing fractionally. This is a plan that can work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes fly open as she remembers the meeting with the lawyer and the lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit that Rio had told her about, her words playing back in her head.
     <em>
      It would help if we joined them. If we told his story.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grinds her teeth, flexing her jaw against the burn in her lungs. The tides of her grief– propelled by her anger and her fragility and her exhaustion from the never ending battle against the ache in her chest– finally close over her head. Agatha feels it settle into her, knows she will spend the rest of the evening and long into the night drowning.
    </p>
    <p>
     She throws the car in drive and pulls out of the lot, the hum of the engine filling her ears as she hits the gas. Agatha’s hands shake the whole way home.

    <p>
     As infrequently as she can get away with, Agatha’s job mandates that she drag herself up to Boston and meet with her boss in person. Being the company’s Chief Marketing Officer has the much appreciated bonus of meaning she answers to nearly no one, but unfortunately the one person Agatha
     <em>
      does
     </em>
     answer to is an obnoxious, overly familiar old bat who is as much bite as she is bark.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s one of the few people in the world that Agatha truly enjoys. Gun to head, she would not admit as much.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia Calderu’s office is on the twentieth floor of a sleek Boston highrise, with massive wooden shelves laden with books covering three of the walls and floor to ceiling windows commanding the fourth. A set of plush love seats angle towards one another around a coffee table on the right half of the room, and on the left Lilia sits in her desk chair like it’s a throne, berating some poor idiot on the other end of the phone in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha merely leans in the doorway, watching the spectacle before her. Grey curls have fallen from Lilia’s bun and bob angrily with her head as she yells, her face turning red with the exertion. She gesticulates with a hand weighed down with chunky mismatched rings, and a similarly uncoordinated arrangement of necklaces pulls at her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     With an air of finality, Lilia hurls demands into the phone and ends the call without waiting for a response, setting it face down on her desk and releasing a sigh. When she turns to Agatha, the red of her cheeks is long forgotten and a small smirk plays at her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” she greets, rising from her chair and rounding to lean on the desk. “Welcome to your February performance review. So nice of you to make it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They both are aware that it is the middle of April, but Lilia’s words hold no indication of disappointment or frustration. If anything, a two month delay is pretty proactive on Agatha’s part. Agatha pushes off from her spot in the doorway and walks fully into the office, her silky white blouse suddenly overwarm in the sun drenched space.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, one of us has to take this job seriously, Calderu. It’s a burden I bear proudly.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia scoffs with a roll of her eyes. With a swift hand she reaches out and catches Agatha’s arm, tugging her into a tight, inescapable hug.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don’t visit enough,” Lilia chastises into her hair. Agatha lets her stiff limbs relax. She is not melting into the hug, thank you very much. She’s just putting up less of a struggle so that it ends sooner. There’s a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia releases her and they assume their usual position– Agatha draped across one of the love seats and Lilia looking regal on the other, each of them sipping from a can of wine and neither of them particularly bothered by the knowledge that it is not yet noon.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thing about Lilia is that she had set up a table at a career fair at the college in the city almost twenty years ago mostly on a whim. As a woman with few resources looking to start her own ad agency, she’d had very little to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, nearing the end of her undergraduate career with a degree in business that she had no true dreams of using, figured a career fair couldn’t hurt. Admittedly, after hearing Lilia’s pitch, Agatha had been a bit of a bitch and laughed at her. She had not expected for Lilia to be an even bigger bitch back, tearing straight into Agatha with no regard for the fact that she was a grown up woman and Agatha was a 22 year old co-ed. It was magnificent.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Divination
     </em>
     was the only place Agatha had ever worked, which meant a few things. First, it meant that she had a hefty amount of respect in all of the offices of the now international firm, so she was very rarely bothered. It also meant that Lilia gave her a lot of leeway, allowing her to make her own hours and project deadlines so long as the company didn’t suffer, which had been instrumental during some rather agonizing periods of her life. But most annoyingly, it meant that Lilia Calderu knew all of Agatha’s business.
    </p>
    <p>
     You invite a woman to your wedding and make her your child’s godmother and suddenly she feels she has a right to know things about you. It’s fucking exhausting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like a well oiled machine, the two traipse through their usual topics. They go over the numbers, chat about potential new clients and the status of current ones, and shit talk their most hated subordinates. For her performance review, Lilia tells her to stop being such a cunt to the men that they hire and to start wearing something nicer than jeans to company meetings. Agatha staunchly refuses to do either, and Lilia simply tilts her head back and finishes her wine.
    </p>
    <p>
     The conversation lulls and Agatha finds herself glancing out through the pristine glass and at the city skyline, listening for the noisy streets that she knows she’s too far up to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’ve been distracted today. Off, somehow, but I can’t put my finger on it.” Lilia’s words aren’t a question but a statement of fact. Though they don’t lack warmth, either.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite being only fifteen years her senior, Lilia has always approached Agatha with something akin to a casual maternal poise that lacks the finesse of a sugar coating but always has her best interests at heart nonetheless. Agatha has never really known what to do with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She turns her head back, meeting the curious but not overbearing gaze that waits for her. Agatha weighs her options.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hasn’t told Wanda about… any of it, really. They don’t talk about the time since Nicky’s death or Rio as a general entity or the lawsuit papers that have been sitting in the junk bin in her kitchen and eating away at her from the inside out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha doesn’t really
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to tell anyone, but the deal with Lilia is that it always comes to light sooner or later. She had been the first person other than Rio to know about the pregnancy, calling Agatha in the middle of the night only days after they’d found out to ask if it was true. She said she just had
     <em>
      one of those feelings
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia had been the one to find Agatha six months after his funeral and two months after Rio had left, answering the door in her robe and sporting enough scratches and bruises to rival a bear attack victim. She’d asked no questions, only letting herself into the kitchen to make enough soup to feed a small army.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she tells her, in broad strokes, about the lawsuit and the meeting she’s not sure she’ll go to. About how the nature of her dynamic with Rio seems to be changing, though in what way she still doesn’t know.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ever astute, Lilia parses through the jungle of what Agatha tells her to get to the heart of what it is she’s not saying, which is that Agatha is, quite plainly, scared. Afraid to open up to strangers about Nicky when she can’t even open up to herself about him without drowning in the endless ocean of her grief. Afraid that even if she wanted to, she’s not sure her body would be physically capable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Setting the issue of Rio aside, Lilia pulls the yellow cardigan she’s wearing in lieu of a blazer tighter across her chest and delivers her verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can go to that meeting and not say a single word, Agatha. You’re not a part of their case and you don’t owe them anything. If it’s truly that awful, you can get up and walk out and never think about it again.” She shrugs, tilting her head to the side like a weight has been added to her mental scales.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Or, maybe you go and it feels nice to be there, in some way, and you agree to sign your name on their papers. Maybe they win the case and there’s money that you can funnel into something you think would honor Nicholas, like research at a children’s hospital or a local youth sports program or a goddamn rabbit sanctuary.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her last suggestion comes as an annoyed huff. None of them had escaped his rabbit phase unscathed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The point is, Agatha, that the lawsuit will happen with or without you. Rio is entitled to join with or without you, though I can’t say that she would. I
     <em>
      can
     </em>
     say that if someone is going to speak on his behalf, you would want it to be you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha finds that she wants to spit on the woman, or throw her wine at her head, or scream something along the lines of
     <em>
      fuck you, you insufferable old hag.
     </em>
     Because she knows as soon as she hears her say it that Lilia is right. About each and every part of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     And because now she has even more information about Agatha. One of these days, she’s sure, Lilia’s going to stop treating her like a person and start looking at her with those big pitying eyes that everyone seems to reserve for wounded fawns and Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Today, however, is not that day.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know, you hardly talk this much about yourself. I’m not used to it. I think I’ve used up all of my empathy and manners for the next five years,” Lilia sighs, opening another can of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorts, pulled from her internal melodrama. “Thank God, it was fucking weird to see you be nice for that long. It’ll be a couple dozen years before I let us do that again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia feigns relief, and they share a smile. Maybe Agatha will make it to their September meeting by October.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Agatha leaves after a few more hours of idle chat and letting the wine leave her system, finally pulling back into her driveway just as the warm evening sun is beginning to melt into the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slamming the driver’s side door shut, she rounds the vehicle to grab her purse from the passenger seat. With her arm still outstretched towards the bag, a burst of sound draws her attention away and into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
     One red and one blue burst of movement peel into view, twining around one another on the quiet neighborhood street in a tornado of sound. The noise changes, though, and draws nearer with a suddenness that startles her. When the blurs of color and sound reach the end of her driveway, she realizes they are neither of those things. They are boys. They are calling her name.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Miss Agatha!” Tommy shouts, dropping his scooter on the pavement and running up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Miss Agatha!” Billy echoes, setting his scooter down more carefully before following his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s heart catches in her throat, tunnel vision putting everything else out of focus as she looks at their faces. At ten years old, the twins seem impossibly big, with gaps in their smiles where their adult teeth haven’t grown in yet and mops of hair that fall in their eyes and curl at their necks and long limbs that don’t quite know what to do with themselves yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two of them now older than Nicky ever got to be. It so viciously, achingly painful. It is so incredibly wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
     They’re speaking one over the other, shooting off rapid fire questions about where she’s been today and how she’s doing and if she’s seen some new movie called Mind Craft. Before she can answer they’ve moved on, talking about school and sports and whatever else ten year old boys fill their time with.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stops listening to their words and focuses instead on their voices, still childlike but less the high pitch squeak of when she’d seen them last. They’ve never looked alike, but now she can see that they both resemble Wanda, in their own way. She wonders if either of them look like Pietro.
    </p>
    <p>
     One hand lands on each set of small shoulders and the noise stops, their two small faces turning to look sheepishly at their mother.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Boys,” Wanda chastizes, though she seems more exasperated than upset. “We told you not to ride too far out ahead of us. When you speed up like that it’s easier for you to get hurt.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, mom,” they chorus back dutifully.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And Ms. Agatha clearly just got home from work. She doesn’t need two little fireworks popping around her feet and talking her ears off.” This she delivers more playfully, and her words pull a giggle from Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry, Ms. Agatha,” they turn and chorus to her. Their newfound docility gives her whiplash, but she offers them a sweet smile reserved for, well, no one anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s alright boys, I know you were just excited.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Vision calls to the twins from the end of the driveway and they tear back to him, throwing Agatha a wave over their shoulders before returning to their scooters once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry about that,” Wanda winces, seemingly ready for Agatha to lash out. A part of her wants to, but she leans instead into the lingering softness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s really fine. They’re– they’ve grown so much. You’re doing a really great job with them, Wanda.” Agatha nearly vomits at the sincerity in her words. This is why she pushes off her meetings with Lilia– they make her mushy. She’ll get around to their September meeting by next January.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda softens, turning her gaze back to the street for a moment, where the boys are trying to explain the rules of a clearly made up game to a confused Vision.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lets Wanda chatter on about things like the weather and work and some crazy PTA moms raising hell about the height of the slide on the school playground, allowing this last bit of human interaction before another quiet night at home.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The flowers at Nicky’s grave were very beautiful this year. Something about the colors just reminded me a lot of him,” Wanda says, pulling Agatha’s focus abruptly back to her ramblings.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” Agatha spits, torn between confusion and anger. Why would Wanda know? Why would Wanda bring it up? Wanda looks to her more fully, her eyes widening.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh! I mean, the flowers are always really lovely, don’t get me wrong. These ones just–”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your opinion on the flowers does not matter to me at all. How do you know what they looked like?” She demands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda seems to calm down at this, like she was more worried about offending Agatha’s flower choices. Agatha hasn’t made a single flower choice since she was twenty years old and brought Rio a pitiful, wilting bouquet from the local grocery store and Rio had decreed that she would handle all things flora for the rest of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I saw them when we went to visit. Vis and I take the boys usually in the days after his birthday so they can spend some time with him. They like to tell him their favorite moments from the past year.” And then, almost as an afterthought she adds, “we don’t go on the day of because I figured you guys would want that for yourselves.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s the first time Wanda has mentioned either Nicky or Rio directly– or as close to directly as one can get. Agatha doesn’t know what to do with the feeling, doesn’t know how to handle two different people speaking about her son in one day when usually he lives entirely in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if remembering what she’d told the kids about Agatha having just gotten back from work, Wanda takes a step back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I have to wrangle this group and get everyone ready for bed soon. It was good to see you, Agatha. I haven’t forgotten about our walk,” she jokes with a wink. Agatha bids her a goodbye and watches the four of them head down the street towards their house before going into her own home.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sets her bag down by the door, toeing off her flats and padding into the living room where she pulls a framed photo down from the shelf by the TV and runs her fingers over the glass. In the print, Nicky and the twins and a handful of other neighborhood kids stand huddled together, dirty and grinning from a summer day spent running outside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sometimes, he becomes something of an imaginary friend in her mind, encased in the thick, impenetrable shell of her grief and devotion. But other times, like today, Agatha remembers that he was a boy. A kid with a thousand friends everywhere he went and a laugh so contagious it could get him out of any trouble. A standout in the elementary school choir with a voice like a songbird and the runner up in the second grade spelling bee.
    </p>
    <p>
     On days like this, Agatha can feel the ache grow less persistent, soothed by the knowledge that other people hold him in their hearts, too, even if it’s difficult to think of him as anyone’s but hers. Theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a small, quiet part of herself, Agatha lets herself feel relieved that little pieces of him are scattered all over this town and as far away as Boston– relieved that she isn’t Atlas carrying the weight of his memory on her shoulders alone. Pushes away the nagging thought that she has never been Atlas, that there have always been four hands holding up this sky, not just her own two.
    </p>
    <p>
     The meeting is a week away. As much as Agatha wishes it wasn’t true, she knows she’ll be there.

    <p>
     One week comes and goes, and Agatha spends all seven days stewing. She remembers exactly why it is that she’s been angry for so long, why she doesn’t want to join the stupid lawsuit.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she’d told herself that she would at least hear them out, and Lilia had taken it upon herself to cancel all of Agatha’s meetings for the day without consulting her, so she puts her car in park and stares at the nondescript building that her GPS has brought her to. Agatha doesn’t normally come to this part of town, and the lack of familiarity only adds to her growing sense of unease.
    </p>
    <p>
     She steps out of the car and locks it, smoothing down the skirt of the black dress that she’d begrudgingly borrowed from Wanda since all of her nice shit hangs weird and loose on her now.
    </p>
    <p>
     (She’d discovered as much over the weekend. When had she last worn something that wasn’t jeans or leggings? Pathetic.)
    </p>
    <p>
     The dress has a straight neck that cuts across her collarbones and long sleeves that hug her arms down to her wrists, the skirt full enough to not be indecent but still stopping a full three inches above Agatha’s knees. Her feet ache already in her deep plum colored pumps and the matching blazer she’d decided to drape over her shoulders feels like a parka beneath the weight of the April sun.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tosses her hair back over her shoulders, having found the patience to brush it all out but not to style it. The ends curl against the small of her back– she needs a haircut, probably, but that used to be Rio’s job. Another thought added to the long list of things that are pissing her off today.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilts her head up to look at the building before her- a modern, chrome pillar with windows that have been tinted to keep prying eyes from knowing what goes on inside. As if anything in there is important enough to warrant such precautions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Absently, she twirls the ring on her middle finger with her thumb. It’s a simple gold band with three small overlapping hearts ingrained in the center, one Nicky had gotten her for Mothers Day, which of course means Rio had taken him to the store to pick something out and then purchased it for him. It’s a small talisman, nothing that anyone else would take notice of. Agatha hopes it will make her brave.
    </p>
    <p>
     Belatedly, Agatha realizes she’s nervous. She had never given Rio an answer one way or the other, not deeming the situation serious enough to unblock her number, but now she has the sudden burning fear that maybe Rio won’t be here after all and she’ll have to do this by herself. Sweating from the anxiety, Agatha tears the blazer from her shoulders and tosses it carelessly back into the car before slamming the door once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     She thinks she might throw up her coffee in the decorative, half-dead bushes lining the parking lot at the thought of facing this alone, but then she sees her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leaning against the building just to the side of the front doors, face drawn in concentration beneath her sunglasses as she talks into her phone, her free arm crossed over her chest while her hand gesticulates in time with her words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hair is pulled back in a clip again, her arms left bare by the sleeveless cream mock turtleneck that she wears tucked into dark blue slacks that narrow at her ankles. She taps one loafer-clad foot against the concrete, clearly displeased with whatever conversation she’s having. The sunlight catches on the defined muscles of her arms, golden bronze and mouthwatering.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha knows the moment she sees her because she lifts the sunglasses from her face, meeting Agatha’s eyes with neither a smile nor a frown and quickly wrapping up her conversation.
     <em>
      She was waiting for me
     </em>
     , Agatha realizes with a start. Unsure what to do with that, she simply crosses the lot to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You came,” Rio says, her tone intentionally neutral.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I did,” Agatha responds airily, unwilling to give her anything deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio seems to accept it for what it is and holds the door open for Agatha to walk through, a cool wave of air conditioning hitting them both. Agatha mindlessly follows her past the receptionist and down to the hall to an elevator, watching Rio extend a finger to press one of the buttons and the chrome doors sliding shut. Agatha has the faint feeling that she’s walking passively into her own slaughter, but when the doors slide open once more she follows Rio down another hall and into a conference room.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio pushes the doors open, Agatha steps through and does a sweep of the room. A tacky faux-wood paneling covers the walls to her right and left, each sporting a dated flat screen TV that must be used for video calls or presentations or other boring shit. Agatha looks past the long table that takes up the bulk of the space and instead peers out the line of windows across the far wall. Since they’re only three or four stories up, she can see everyone walking around outside like they’re little dolls, or maybe ants.
    </p>
    <p>
     She focuses on the ant-dolls and not the sweaty man in a rumpled suit who immediately rises to greet them, shaking Rio’s hand firmly and then turning to do the same for her. When Agatha simply stares at him, he drops his hand back to his side with an awkward laugh and turns back to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, it’s so nice to put a face with the name from our emails,” he croons, earning a polite response from her. He shifts his focus back to Agatha now that his confidence has been boosted by witnessing Rio’s easy grace.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And Mrs. Vidal–”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Harkness.” Agatha cuts him off, already wondering how she's going to tolerate him for the entire meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beside her, Rio’s wince is so incredibly slight that she’s sure nobody else catches it. What had she been expecting? Agatha is not going to turn into some kind, docile creature just because she conceded to attend this meeting. The creature that lurks beneath her skin and cries out for blood has not retreated in the slightest.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah, well then, Ms. Harkness. My name is Stephen Strange, and I’m the lead attorney for the case against the Perlman Clinic. Please, have a seat and we'll get started.” The man settles back into his chair at the head of the table. Rio tries to pull Agatha’s rolling chair out but she snatches it away quickly, pushing herself in and tapping the nails of her left hand across the wood impatiently. Rio settles into the chair next to her suavely, seemingly unbothered by the rejection.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the first time since walking in, Agatha looks at the two silent women sitting directly across from them, their backs to the windows. The woman perpendicular to Agatha sits tall– regal, almost– with dark skin so smooth that Agatha almost finds herself feeling insecure about her own appearance. She knows her age is starting to show on her face and in the silver strands she’s begun to see in her hair brush, but this woman makes her feel like a crone.
    </p>
    <p>
     She shakes herself out of it.
     <em>
      What the fuck is happening? I’m not even 40. And this is not the time.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Long golden earrings dangle from the woman’s ears and her pale pink dress makes her glow. She’s icy, formidable even, and the only show that she’s a living creature and not a statue is the hand resting on the thigh next to her, rubbing an absent pattern with her thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
     The other woman seems smaller, more haggard. She has the same tired eyes that Agatha recognizes from the mirror, her dark shaggy hair sticking out at odd angles from running her fingers through it over and over again– Agatha presumes– with the ends dyed a fiery red. A leather jacket rests draped over the chair behind her, her button up and slacks the same black hue.
    </p>
    <p>
     She keeps checking the time on the thick watch the rests on her wrist, almost rhythmically. It grates at Agatha– maybe the unplaced familiarity of it, maybe the sense that the woman feels she has better things to be doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “These are our lead plaintiffs, Jennifer Kale and Alice Wu-Gulliver,” Mr. Strange provides. The first woman– Jennifer– tilts her head toward them in acknowledgement but Alice doesn’t look up, just keeps her eyes trained on the hands of her watch. Rio offers a polite greeting on behalf of them both before finally diving in. She may be handling it better, but Agatha can tell she’s just as over the small talk and false pleasantries as she is.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you think the clinic is truly at fault, why are you proceeding with a civil and not a criminal suit?” She asks, directing her question to Strange. He seems to have been expecting this.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A criminal suit requires that we prove to a jury that the Perlman Clinic is guilty of doctoring the test results beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas a civil trial only needs a preponderance of evidence to find the defendant liable for damages. So instead of having to convince them that the clinic
     <em>
      definitely
     </em>
     neglected their duty, we only have to convince them that it’s most likely true,” he pauses, donning a small smirk as though he can’t hide his pride at the plan. “This way, we’re dramatically more likely to win and the clinic still faces repercussions.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, sick of talking about the whole situation like it’s a game of Monopoly and harboring an increasing desire to hit this man, snaps.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If it’s too hard to prove in criminal court and it’s a slam dunk in civil court, why the hell are we here? It doesn’t seem like one more sob story for the collection is suddenly going to make you good enough at your job to get a guilty verdict. I think you're wasting my time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She doesn’t move her eyes from where they've fallen back to the windows as she speaks, not deeming the lawyer worthy of her full attention. From across the table, Jen remains silent but narrows her eyes at Agatha. The lawyer flicks his gaze nervously between her and Rio, like he thinks Rio somehow can keep her on a leash. For her part, Rio is staring at the ceiling like something there might be merciful enough to grant her patience. Mr. Strange clears his throat, tugging at the collar of his shirt with a finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ms. Vidal said that your family utilized a donor from the Perlman Fertility Clinic to conceive and had– um– difficulties stemming from, potentially, the clinic’s withholding of genetic information regarding your donor. We’ve gathered similar testimonials from several other families, yes, but the more fodder we have the easier it’ll be to nail the clinic on their negligence,” he explains, as if Agatha hasn’t already read the papers Rio left at her house ten times over. As if he’s saying anything she doesn’t already know.
    </p>
    <p>
     His repeated referral to them as a family is starting to wear her raw, a tension headache beginning to form at her temples. When Strange is done speaking, Agatha finally turns her head and looks him fully in the eye. He cringes away from the intensity in her face. Pitiful man.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My son is dead,” she says bluntly. “Would that be the difficulty you’re referring to?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She catches Rio’s pinched expression from the corner of her eye and takes a small delight in the quiet choking sound that the attorney makes, but she feels new eyes on her now. She shifts her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice is looking up from her watch and directly into Agatha’s face, no longer fidgeting, no longer somewhere far away but fully in the room at last. Before the lawyer can stutter out some half-assed correction or Rio can apologize on Agatha's behalf, Alice speaks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Our daughter is five,” she says. Her voice is low but serious, like she needs to be sure that Agatha is listening. She is.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She has cystic fibrosis. They didn’t catch it when they tested her as an infant– which apparently happens almost exclusively to non-white children, by the way– so she’s been hurting all this time and nobody could tell us why. And now that they can, they keep telling us how
     <em>
      unfortunate
     </em>
     it is that she went undiagnosed for so long because of all of the long term setbacks it creates.” Her voice is sharpening now, no louder than before but rising in anger all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My little girl has to sleep with a mask. Every night she begs us not to make her wear it, not to make her take the medicine anymore. I can’t tell a toddler that it’s the only way to delay the lung transplant that the doctors are sure she’ll need soon. I can't tell her she might asphyxiate in her sleep without it.” Alice leans forward in her chair and Agatha instinctively mimics the motion, the two of them trapped in the spell together. In her periphery, Agatha can see the grip that Jen has on Alice’s thigh tightening.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I got tested before the pregnancy. I don’t have the fucking gene. We did
     <em>
      everything right
     </em>
     and this is still happening because that clinic is fucking evil and doesn’t give a shit about any of us so long as they get their money,” Alice’s eyes flash, and Agatha swears she sees fire behind her pupils. “I want them to bleed for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The room falls entirely silent, like Alice’s words have sucked all of the air out. Agatha releases a breath she didn’t know she’d been holding, her anger ebbing slightly and a different tension taking its place. Alice’s eyes flicker briefly back down to her watch, and Agatha feels a sudden clarity at the motion. Alice is running out of time. Because maybe her child is dying, and she knows it, and each passing minute is being pried violently from her grip.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because Alice has probably watched dozens of other parents parade in and out of this room and talk about their dead children before going home to her own dying child, listening to her baby cry and having no way to fix it or slow down the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
     The muscle of Jen’s jaw twitches but she remains otherwise as still as ever, watching Agatha like she’s a predator that could sink her teeth into Alice at any moment. But it’s Rio that breaks the silence with her quiet, measured words.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We can’t prove definitively that what happened to Nicky was a result of the donor’s DNA.” The words shatter the spell and Agatha slumps back into her chair, returning her attention to the windows. A woman in an obnoxious pink sweatsuit walks her fat dog down the sidewalk, and Agatha tracks her steps.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The doctors knew enough to say that his death was caused by a genetic abnormality but not enough to pin down which of us it could have come from,” she continues. “Agatha carried but we used my egg, and I didn’t have any family so my medical history was spotty at best.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sees the dog walker lift her phone to her ear, talking with her mouth all of the way open. She tries to imagine what she could possibly be talking so animatedly about, tries to leave her body and not think about how she killed their son. Or about how Rio thinks
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     killed their son. Neither are thoughts that she can face head on and survive.
    </p>
    <p>
     When he speaks, Mr. Strange’s voice is gentler than it had been before, like Rio is the true grieving mother and Agatha is just the wild beast that she brought along with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “With the more concrete cases that we have, like Alice and Jen’s, your testimony would be more like a support beam around the main structure of our argument. Whether you can trace the abnormality back to the clinic or not doesn’t entirely matter, only that your family’s story can help cast more doubt.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha still doesn’t want to do this, doesn’t know if she can share their son with the world. Can’t bear the thought of him just being a statistic somehow, some afterthought tacked on to a case that will go on with or without him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lawyer seems to watch her face, reading her hesitation and choosing the worst possible way to address it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re also projecting that should we win, each family can expect several thousand dollars from the settlement, provided that–”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio calmly but firmly cuts him off with “we don’t give a shit about the money, Stephen,” at the same time that Agatha yells “
     <em>
      stop calling us a family!
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     The room falls silent again, like they’ve all just noticed that they’re standing directly atop a landmine. Jen’s eyes slide from Agatha to Rio and back, finally assessing part of the situation that she hadn’t deemed important enough to notice before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wisely, Stephen clicks his jaws shut and doesn’t attempt to apologize. Rio turns her whole head to stare at Agatha, who simply meets her eyes with a studiously blank face. She hopes that Rio is using her stupid mind reading powers now and that she can hear her snarling
     <em>
      I’m sure that hurt you and I absolutely do not give a fuck. You dragged me here, but that does not mean we are on the same team. Never again.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     After a moment, Rio breaks their stare to look over to Alice and Jen and then back to Strange, pulling a deep breath in through her nose and lifting the corners of her lips in a forced but polite smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re in. Just let me know what information you need from us and I’ll provide it. You already have my email, Stephen,” Rio says, standing and pulling two business cards from her back pocket before handing one to the lawyer and one to Alice and Jen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watches on in shock, a deafening ringing filling her ears and making it almost impossible to think. It can’t be possible that Rio just answered for the both of them like that. That she didn’t consider how Agatha might feel at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she tries to wrap her head around it, she notices everyone else has stood from their seats as well, shaking hands and exchanging contact information. Agatha stays in her chair, her legs ignoring her demand to run far away and never come back. She finds Alice watching her, something a little too knowing in her gaze. She’s calm again, but Agatha knows what she saw– knows that fire is still burning behind her eyes. Knows the same fire has long since turned everything inside of herself to ash.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice looks away when Jen places a hand to the small of her back and the two turn to consult with Strange, probably about what their agreement means for the case as a whole. Agatha pushes back from her chair and turns to leave without a word, but Rio is already at her back, holding the door open. Agatha doesn’t look at her as she walks through.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lets Rio start to lead them back toward the elevator, but once Agatha’s sure they’re out of earshot she sinks her claws into the meat of Rio’s forearm, ignoring the pained hiss she releases and dragging them through maze-like halls until she finds a bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s shock lasts long enough to let Agatha shove her through the door and into the cramped space, keeping her still while Agatha snicks the lock shut. It’s a a small single-occupancy bathroom that fits the ambiance of the overly pristine building, with white walls and a small vanity and a fake plant with waxy plastic leaves in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How dare you agree to join them without even asking me first? You think that just because we were polite on his birthday you have any right to speak for me?” Agatha spits, jabbing a finger out. Rio huffs an incredulous laugh, pacing in the cramped room like she’ll explode if she stands still.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I actually can’t believe I have to say this again, but this isn’t about
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     , Agatha. And while we’re at it, I’m not surprised that you don’t have empathy for me. I stopped expecting that a long time ago. But it is
     <em>
      insane
     </em>
     that you don’t have any for people like Jen and Alice. Even I didn’t think you could be that heartless.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s Agatha’s turn to scoff, absorbing the sharp sting of Rio’s words and letting it feed the rising flames of rage inside of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can drop the ‘woe is me’ act. We both know that you don’t need my empathy. You haven’t for years.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moves in a flash, shoving Agatha back with both hands. Agatha winces when her back connects with the marble of the vanity, but the pain is dulled by the surprise of seeing this side of Rio in public. She’s close enough now that Agatha can smell the spearmint of her favorite gum on her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck
     </em>
     you, you don’t get to decide what I need. You think you can pretend that you know a damn thing about me and then sit in there and tell those people we’re not a family. Maybe you never knew me at all.” Rio is seething, each word hissed out like she can poison Agatha with her voice alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha would almost be amused, could maybe even laugh if what she said didn’t piss her off so bad.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus, Rio. Don’t act like I’m the bad guy here. You’re actually losing it if that’s what you’re hung up on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s halfway through an eye roll when Rio crowds her against the sink, a hand framing her throat and pressing in. The cool metal of Rio’s rings stings against the heated skin, the pressure not quite cutting Agatha’s airflow off entirely but definitely restricting it. Her exhale could be mistaken for a quiet moan, if someone were listening for that sort of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes are wild– enraged, unleashed. Her voice is a growl.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can lie to yourself all you want but you can’t fucking lie to me, Agatha. I’m your family and you’re mine, until all three of us are in the ground together.” She increases the pressure at Agatha’s throat. “Don’t you fucking forget that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha opens her mouth, ready to launch something vile enough to destabilize her, but Rio is on her before she can. Her tongue pushes past Agatha’s lips and teeth and swallows both the fire in her throat and the gasp that the motion draws, drinking them down and punctuating the theft with a dig of her teeth into Agatha’s bottom lip.
    </p>
    <p>
     The counter is painful against the small of her back, but Rio draws somehow closer still as she kisses her, pressing further into Agatha until it feels like there’s no air left for her lungs, just Rio’s mouth on hers and Rio’s hand at her throat and Rio’s perfume making her eyes water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Desperate to retaliate, Agatha makes an attempt at digging her nails into Rio’s exposed biceps. Rio pulls away and intercepts her quickly, grabbing both hands and spinning her around to pin them on the cold marble of the vanity. She presses herself to Agatha’s back, bending her over and creating a cage with her body. Her words lose none of their violent edge despite being delivered as a purr into Agatha’s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re not doing things your way today,
     <em>
      Harkness
     </em>
     . I am going to go back to work after this without a single fucking scratch because you are going to show me some respect for once in your life.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Internally, Agatha turns molten at the words, at Rio’s tone. She’s pretty sure she’s soaked through her panties, might even be dripping. Externally, Agatha laughs a mean little laugh with the sole purpose of knocking Rio down a peg.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You think you’re hot shit today, huh?” Her words come out with the full extent of their intended snark, and Agatha feels her mind clear fractionally with the leverage.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio only smirks at her, meeting Agatha’s eyes in the mirror before gripping her hip with one hand to hold her in place and pressing the fingers of her other hand featherlight to the back of Agatha’s opposite knee, lifting her dress as she goes. Agatha’s stance is widened with the position Rio holds her in and she’s bent over further than she would be without her heels. She sucks in a breath through her teeth, not daring to look away from Rio’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those fingers slide steadily upwards, slow and intentional. Agatha might be shaking, but that's not important. And Rio can surely feel the heat radiating off of Agatha’s cunt before she even hits mid-thigh, but that's not important either.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her touch somehow, maddeningly, slows down the higher she rises, the smirk on her face growing wider and crueler. Agatha watches their reflection as Rio leans in closer to her ear, never once breaking their stare.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I bet you’ve been desperate for me for months, probably fucking yourself to the thought of my touch like a pathetic whore. So stupid for it that you pulled me into the bathroom of a law firm.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha wants to push back– wants to tell Rio that she’s a sick freak drunk on a power trip– but instead her eyelids flutter shut and her cheeks burn. When Agatha forces her eyes back open and finds her gaze again, it’s Rio's turn to laugh. The sound registers closer to a snarl, but there’s no mistaking it with the way her face is alight with a violent glee. Agatha feels her arousal begin to spill down her thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s exactly what I thought,” Rio sighs, as though they’re both working from the same script and Agatha keeps forgetting her lines. She shifts her hand slightly and suddenly a single finger rests against the crease of Agatha’s thigh, the tip of a nail tracing the damp skin. Agatha nearly bites through her tongue trying not to react.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Here’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to fuck you in this bathroom like the filthy slut that you are, and you’re going to stay nice and quiet so that the poor people in this office don’t find you in here with my fingers stuffed in your dripping cunt. Do you understand?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gives her pride and her horniness exactly three quarters of a second to make their arguments before she nods, catching her own reflection in the mirror and finding that she’s already panting and flushed, looking like she’s about to cum untouched. She feels less bad about not making a stand for her pride.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio still doesn’t move, Agatha looks back up at her and finds that she’s still waiting. After a tense beat, Agatha narrows her eyes, grinding out a
     <em>
      yes ma'am
     </em>
     through clenched teeth. The smile that Rio gives her in response settles low in her gut, lust and fear coiling tightly around one another.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without further teasing, Rio pulls the gusset of her panties to the side and runs two fingers from Agatha’s entrance to her clit, a pleased little hum escaping from the back of her throat as she passes through slick folds with no resistance. The touch is, embarrassingly, enough to get Rio’s fingers sufficiently wet and she presses them both in to the hilt with a quickness that nearly has Agatha’s legs buckling.
    </p>
    <p>
     She fights back against the moans and whimpers that threaten to spill from her lips, but when Rio adds a third finger without warning Agatha can’t stop the whine that slips out of her. Almost immediately Rio’s free hand leaves Agatha’s hip and settles beneath her chin, her thumb holding Agatha’s jaw steady while she pushes her middle and ring finger past her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watches the scene unfold through the mirror, right down to the moment Rio presses down on the back of her tongue and makes her gag. Her silver rings clink against Agatha’s teeth, turning warm in her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still fucking into her at a brutal pace that presses Agatha’s quickly bruising hip bones into the counter with each thrust, Rio leans back in towards her ear to murmur filthy praise and abuse alike in a voice so low that Agatha can barely hear it over the pounding drum of her own pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sweat beads at Rio’s brow from the exertion, though not enough to disturb her makeup or pull even a single strand from her neat updo. In contrast Agatha’s thighs are shaking and her chest heaving. Spit dribbles out of her lips and down Rio’s fingers as she pumps them in and out of her mouth, falling very conveniently into the bowl of the sink below. The sounds of their heavy breaths fill the room, overshadowed only by the lewd, wet sounds of Rio fucking her on both ends.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha prides herself on remaining exceptionally quiet, given that without the makeshift gag she’s certain she’d be screaming by now. She’s jostled out of the thought when a particularly harsh thrust into her cunt rocks her forward harder than expected and sends the fingers in her mouth further down her throat. Agatha gags harshly on the digits and feels tears slip down her cheeks, but Rio’s answering groan in her ear has her eyes rolling back into her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a renewed vigor, Agatha begins rolling her hips back to meet each of Rio’s thrusts, pushing those fingers further into her cunt and nearly weeping in relief when the change has each inward press brushing the spot inside of her that makes her brainless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s babbling into her ear now, watching with rapt attention as her fingers piston in and out of Agatha. “I wish I had my strap so I could make sure you won’t be able to walk tomorrow. Would make you get on all fours right here and pound this pussy 'til you beg me to stop,” she breathes, not looking up until her words make Agatha clench so hard that she almost forces Rio’s fingers out of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio huffs a harsh laugh. “You’re so fucking easy. Once a cockslut always a cockslut, isn't that right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Far beyond the land of rational thought, all Agatha can do is nod around the fingers in her mouth, sucking them in greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go on, pretty girl, touch yourself for me. Make a show of it,” Rio taunts, amusement clear in her tone. Agatha complies all the same, resting her weight on one shaky arm and moving her left hand beneath the bunched skirt of her dress. When her fingers slide beneath the waistband of her underwear and find her swollen clit, Agatha nearly collapses, choking again on Rio’s fingers when her head falls forward with the motion. She catches herself at the last second, gripping the counter’s edge for dear life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hair shields her face as she pants, starting a steady rhythm at her clit that she knows will have her seeing stars soon enough. She tries to remember to hold onto the fight of it all– to give as good as she gets– but all she can focus on is being so full that she can’t breathe, so full that she can’t think. Just how she likes it.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio’s fingers in her cunt and at her lips stop moving at once. Agatha looks up, frantically shaking the hair from her face and finding Rio in the mirror with wide, panicked eyes. The moment their eyes connect, Rio thrusts forcefully back in, curling her fingers precisely into Agatha’s g-spot with a clear message.
     <em>
      Look at me.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha complies, all of her senses completely overtaken by Rio. She picks up speed against her clit, rubbing in tight circles, and in less than a minute she feels the wave of pleasure beginning to crest. Agatha tries to warn Rio with her eyes, tries to pull off of her fingers to speak, but Rio presses down on her tongue, effectively hooking her like a fish, and picks up the pace. Agatha knows she'll be bruised from the way her knuckles slam repeatedly into tender flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Remember, Aggie. Not a sound,” Rio warns quietly, her breath hot against the shell of Agatha’s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s all the encouragement she needs, and Agatha comes with a silent scream. For a second, she wonders if she actually might black out, the pleasure so overwhelming that it turns blinding. Rio pulls her fingers from Agatha’s mouth and holds her waist with the spit-soaked digits while she comes down, making sure Agatha doesn’t collapse onto the tile floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     When her breathing has slowed back down to something close to normal, Rio slowly pulls the fingers of her other hand out of Agatha’s cunt, and the sense of loss is instant and staggering. Agatha can only watch through hooded eyes as Rio’s reflection sucks those dripping fingers clean, turning to pull a paper towel from the dispenser and wiping them off when the only dampness left is her own spit. The sight makes Agatha clench again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I gave Stephen your email too, so keep an eye on your inbox in case he needs anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha splutters as though ice water has been dumped over her head and injected into her veins, so thrown by Rio’s snap-second change from domineering to detached that she can’t form words. Rio seems to take no notice of her astonishment, only turning without saying goodbye and slipping back out through the door, leaving Agatha alone with the silent walls and the oppressive stench of sex.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a rush of belated shame, Agatha cleans herself up, straightening out the neckline of her dress and gingerly dabbing at her face with a damp paper towel. When she stands up straight, she knows that her hips are bruised from the counter top and from Rio’s hands. Even worse, she knows it’s going to take all of her might to walk out of this building with a normal gait with the throbbing between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     She readjusts her underwear from where they’ve been yanked to the side and the feeling of the cold, wet fabric against her feverish skin makes her want to scream. Instead, Agatha pulls herself together, running a hand through her hair and walking back to the elevator with her head held high. On the ride down, she notices the wet spot on her waist– a likeness of Rio’s fingers painted in her own spit. She cringes when she remembers this dress is borrowed.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she gets back to the ground floor and out into the afternoon light of the parking lot, Rio is nowhere to be found.

   <div>
    <p>
     In the second week of May, Agatha breaks. She’s been diligently ignoring all of Stephen’s emails and throwing herself uncharacteristically into work to the point where she joins a virtual meeting early and catches two employees debating whether or not she’s having a psychotic break. She’s so distracted she forgets to have them fired for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Truthfully, she’d almost rather rake her eyes out with her nails, but Agatha employs her final line of defense against her brain’s incessant rehashing of what happened in the law office bathroom. She’s tried fruitlessly to rid herself of the memory– to forget the way that Rio had left without a word, without even looking back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though she should have expected as much. Rio doesn’t owe her anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there is only so much ruminating she can do on one line of thought, and Agatha was desperate enough to do the unthinkable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Three days ago, she had run into Wanda on the sidewalk while getting her mail and agreed to go on a walk together. She walked back inside afterward and barely resisted the urge to throw herself down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sits in the passenger seat of Wanda’s silver mini van with her window rolled halfway down, listening to Wanda hum along to whatever pop song is on and letting the breeze caress her face. They’d decided on a trail less than an hour outside of town, a meandering little path through the woods by the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda parks in the small gravel lot at the trailhead, tucking the car keys into her crossbody bag and adjusting her ponytail. Agatha runs a hand down the front of her oversized t-shirt that depicts a cartoon tent framed by a stupid boner joke. She’d bought it at the thrift store when she was pregnant and in need of anything that would cover her stomach, though now it’s just an old comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda makes small talk about the frenzy of the boys’ exam prep at school and the coworkers that are pissing her off as they walk, watching their feet as they go to avoid a twisted ankle.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s not steep enough to be considered a hike by any means, but Agatha feels herself breaking a sweat and knows her thighs will be sore from the effort tomorrow. She’s been eating more often lately– if only to avoid borrowing any more of Wanda’s clothes– and hauling dirt around the yard now that all of the plants have come back to life, bringing some muscularity back to her frame. Agatha thought that with her newfound energy, the walk would be a breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was wrong. It’s a small mercy that Wanda doesn’t expect a response from Agatha as she talks, seemingly content to let her focus on working gulps of air into her heaving lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
     When finally the path evens out and they find themselves on a wide, smooth stretch, Wanda lobs the conversation in her direction.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So what have you been up to?”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s inconspicuous enough, really. Agatha could say something about her failed attempts at gardening or her projects at work, but whatever madness had compelled her to join Wanda on the trail in the first place seems to be taking over again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There’s this…legal matter with the fertility clinic we used. Some missing information and sick kids, stuff like that,” Agatha begins, trying to find the right words. It’s not that she doesn’t trust Wanda with the information so much as it is that it feels a bit like standing naked under a fluorescent light to talk about it. Graciously, Wanda keeps her eyes on the forest while Agatha talks, not adding the burden of eye contact to the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s just been a bit much, I guess. I don’t see why they think that just because other kids have problems they’re entitled to pry into my life and pick apart his memory,” Agatha huffs, crossing her arms over her chest and flicking her heavy braid back over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     She finds she’s not entirely sure how she wants Wanda to respond. If she wants her to at all. It feels like strange new territory, putting herself in this vulnerable unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I always think about when the boys first started kindergarten. They were so scared of everything, and at recess they’d just sit in the grass by themselves, too shy to talk to anyone else. Some older kids took to taunting them, calling them ‘the conjoined twins’ and threatening to pull them apart. But then Nicky was there, standing between the boys and these kids that were surely twice his size. From what I’ve been told he gave them quite the dressing down, and they never bothered the boys again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s a nice story, Agatha concedes, but she truly has no idea how it’s connected to what she’d said about the lawsuit. Maybe Wanda hadn’t been listening? Maybe she doesn’t know how to handle Agatha showing vulnerability so she’s changing the subject?
    </p>
    <p>
     But Wanda glances over at her, offering a small smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Other people can try to pick apart Nicky’s memory all they want, but it’s never going to change who he was to the people that loved him. Billy and Tommy don’t remember him because of some legal thing with a fertility clinic. They remember him because in their eyes he’ll always be a larger-than-life hero that hung the moon.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh.
     </em>
     Agatha swallows around the lump that forms in her throat, surprised at the feeling of her anxiety easing some with the words. Hearing again that other people remember him, think about him, say his name out loud. She thinks again about what Wanda had said about having to carry her grief alone, and about Atlas holding up the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     She thinks about how Rio already decided that Nicky will be part of the lawsuit– just another statistic for Stephen’s argument– and how maybe the best revenge she can get is ensuring that they can’t have him without acknowledging that he was a little boy. That he
     <em>
      lived
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     In lieu of thanks, Agatha offers a memory of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you remember the time we were at the pool and the twins hadn’t learned how to swim yet but didn’t want to use waterwings anymore? Nicky took turns hoisting them on his back around the shallow end so that they could play with all of the other kids. He pretended they were sea-knights and he was their seahorse.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Surprise flashes on Wanda’s face but she covers it quickly. “Of course I do. They demanded Vision be their seahorse every time we went to the pool for the rest of the summer. And then they would scold him for not ‘doing it like Nicky.’ It was hysterical.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha expects the memory to leave her feeling raw, but instead all it brings is a warmth. She smiles along with Wanda, and the beast beneath her skin stays quiet for the first time in a while.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky was seven that summer, and he’d had a growth spurt that had left him a whole head taller than the twins. Both of his front teeth had fallen out and were slow growing back in, and he’d taken to sticking his tongue out through the gap. Agatha joked that if he’d looked like Rio before he was surely the spitting image now, and Rio would fake-pout until one or both of them made a show of groveling for her forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a stretch of quiet, the pair reach a point where the path opens up to a small pebbled beach, the slate grey sea water lapping gently against the stones. It’s a small shoreline, only a few yards in either direction, as though it was deliberately carved out of the forest to give the land a reprieve from the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha squints in the direct sunlight after so long on the shaded path and lifts a hand to shield her eyes, looking out towards the water. The outline of a woman sits atop a large rock nearby, her back to Agatha. She wears jean shorts and a band tee with the sleeves hacked off that matches her hiking boots. One leg is drawn up to support her chin while the other dangles off the side of the boulder, swaying lightly back and forth. Agatha recognizes Alice by the fiery tips of her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     She follows Alice’s line of sight to see Jen, barefoot in the water with her yoga pants rolled up past her knees. She holds the hand of a little girl with coffee skin and two french braids that explode into curly pigtails. The girl grips Jen’s hand back in her tiny fist, flapping her other hand excitedly in the air while she squeals in the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha doesn’t realize she’s been staring until the ringtone of Wanda’s phone breaks the quiet. Wanda pulls the device free from her bag and glances down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, it’s Vis. Do you mind if I take this real quick?” She asks, almost apologetically. Agatha rolls her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda, answer the man. He could’ve burnt down your house.” Wanda’s brows draw together like she’s considering Agatha’s words as a real possibility before she steps back towards the treeline and lifts the phone to her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looks back to see Alice’s eyes already on her, having turned at the sound of her voice. She offers a small wave when she catches Agatha’s eye, and Agatha decides it would be more awkward to outright ignore her for the duration of Wanda’s phone call.
    </p>
    <p>
     She walks over and stands a few feet away from the rock, her head level with Alice’s shoulder. To her delight Alice offers no small talk, and instead they both seem content to watch the scene before them.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she didn’t already know that Alice and Jen’s daughter was five she would guess the girl couldn’t be more than three with how tiny her frame is. Her laughter rings in the air like a bell and her eyes are bright, but there’s something tired behind her movements, like invisible weights have been tied to her ankles and wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Her name is Lorna,” Alice says after a while. “After my mother. She died while I was pregnant.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha thinks to offer her condolences, but it feels like the wrong thing to do. If someone offered their condolences about her mother’s death she would spit on them, probably. But Alice named her daughter after Lorna, so Agatha’s doubtful that would be her response.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha remains silent, watching how Lorna seems to get winded quickly, how now that she’s watching she can see that Jen is supporting the bulk of her weight as she splashes around in her little wetsuit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Researchers have made incredible progress towards closing in on a cure for cystic fibrosis in the past twenty years alone. There’s a lot for them to work with. She has time,” Agatha says. She can feel Alice’s eyes on her face but she keeps her gaze steadily ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice seems torn between her surprise at Agatha’s knowledge and her annoyance at the blunt commentary on her deepest wound.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How do you know that?” She asks. Agatha shrugs dismissively.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I googled it after our meeting.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha does not share that she has spent several evenings curled up in her bed with her laptop on her knees, reading studies from the Mayo Clinic and falling down rabbit holes on Reddit forums full of parents of kids with CF and adults with CF. Alice looks back to Jen and Lorna.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She can’t play for more than ten minutes without getting winded. She can barely run, and sometimes even getting too excited about a cartoon or a song makes her breathing go crazy. The doctors say it’ll be like this until she gets a lung transplant, but they keep reminding us it’s tricky to find donor lungs that are a match
     <em>
      and
     </em>
     small enough to fit her body.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice’s jaw flexes like she’s tasting something bitter. She shakes her head slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re waiting for another kid to die, is what they’re really saying. For some other person’s baby’s heart to stop so that their lungs can go in my baby.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gets it, then, why Alice is so certain that the clinic must pay. Because they’ve put her in the position to have to hope that somebody else’s child dies. Because as awful as it is, Alice is clinging to that hope.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Alice is angry at the clinic, and angry at herself, and angry at the whole world, probably, when little Lorna’s giggles turn into a hacking cough and Jen immediately sweeps her out of the water and into her arms, a soothing hand on her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pristine, regal Jen doesn’t seem the least bit bothered by her previously untouched outfit being drenched by the shaking body pressed to her chest, focused only on getting them back to the shore and whispering soft, soothing words into Lorna’s hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda appears from the trees at the same moment, calling down to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ready to keep walking?” She asks, directing a polite smile to Alice, who nods in greeting. Agatha snaps her eyes away from Jen and up to Wanda, giving her a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, I’ll be right there.” As Agatha makes to leave, Alice shifts to one side and pulls her phone from the pocket of her shorts.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, Jen told Rio, but there’s a support group for everyone in the suit plus the people that Stephen contacted but didn’t want to join. I don’t know if you’d ever want to go, but I want you to have the option.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She opens a blank text thread and pastes the link to the group’s page in, handing the phone to Agatha to type in her number and hit send. Agatha complies and gives it back, offering Alice a short goodbye. Alice pockets the phone and pushes off the rock to join her family at the shore, and Agatha joins Wanda to continue on the path.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda, for her part, doesn’t pry. She lets them walk quietly for a few minutes, listening to the squirrels rustling in the trees and the fading sound of the waves, before speaking again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They seem nice. Cute kid, too.” Her tone is light, not probing but still leaving the door open, should Agatha wish to walk through it. Agatha gives a noncommittal hum.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t really know them like that.” Wanda lets it drop, and they finish the walk without incident.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the drive home is nearing its end, Wanda turns the radio down slightly and drums her fingers against the wheel, like she’s hyping herself up for something. Agatha watches her curiously from the corner of her eye, waiting to see where it goes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re hosting a party at the end of June to celebrate the end of the school year. At our house. I promise I don’t have any expectation for you to come and there will be no hurt feelings, but I wanted to invite you anyway. To let you know that you’re welcome,” she says, but she pushes it all out in one breath so it comes out as one long, incoherent word.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinks, piecing together what Wanda’s trying to say. A party at the end of the school year, presumably with all of their neighbors and all of the kids that used to stomp through her house and run around her yard. She thinks of how odd it would be to show up alone after all of these years as a recluse– the questions she won’t be able to answer and the smiles she won’t fake for them.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then again, when had she really ever? It’s not like she’s ever been a well-mannered housewife like the rest of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ll see,” Agatha says, not willing to commit one way or the other. Even so, Wanda relaxes visibly, seeming pleased by this answer. She drops Agatha off at home with the promise to reach out soon, swearing that she has to come over for dinner one of these days.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t push it, Red,” Agatha deadpans, glaring at her before getting out of the van and walking inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha carries herself through the motions of showering and eating and dragging her sore body into bed, shuffling down beneath the covers before grabbing her glasses from the nightstand. She pulls her laptop over from where it rests on the far side of the bed and pulls up the link from Alice, saving her number before clicking on the link in their chat.
    </p>
    <p>
     The support group page is more active than Agatha was expecting, with a message board and section for photos and a drop down menu for subgroups that she’s not entirely sure how to navigate. She skims briefly through the recent messages before clicking on the icon to see all of the names, morbidly curious to see if there’s anyone she knows.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides Alice and Jen, Agatha’s shocked to find around 20 people are already in the group, herself included. That’s a minimum of ten households that might have been impacted by the clinic withholding information. The thought makes Agatha sick, her dinner churning uneasily in her stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sees Rio’s name on the list, with a blank profile picture and a little ‘0’ next to it to indicate that she hasn’t posted any messages to the page. She keeps scrolling, zooming in on the little images to see that some of the people look to be about her age, though some are much younger and some definitely older, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wonders how many of them have dead kids, how many of the still living ones will actually make it to adulthood. She thinks of five year old Lorna being betrayed by her own body, of the sleep mask Alice had talked about. She thinks of the other faceless, nameless kid that has to die for Lorna to get better.
    </p>
    <p>
     All of it adds to her growing nausea and she abruptly reaches out and slaps the computer shut, but not before seeing that the group’s next meeting is this coming Thursday.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slips her glasses back off and pushes her laptop back over to the empty half of the bed, sliding out from beneath the blankets and padding down the hall in the dark. She carefully twists the knob of the door at the top of the stairs and flicks on the light, hovering like a ghost in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course it’s all the same, disturbed only when Agatha comes in to dust or vacuum or change the sheets on the bed. The overstuffed bookshelf in the corner might as well be groaning beneath the weight of his comic books and lego creations, the dog-eared copy of
     <em>
      The Lightning Thief
     </em>
     waiting patiently on his dinosaur nightstand for his next birthday reading.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pale blue walls are plastered with paintings and drawings and posters, his plaque of recognition from choir leaning on the windowsill. Señor Scratchy the rabbit lays face up on the bed, his black plastic eyes staring up at the glow in the dark stars that Rio had painstakingly formed into constellations across the ceiling. The large, almost uninterpretable watercolor portrait he’d made of the three of them in his kindergarten art class is framed on the wall above his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     It feels like looking at a piece of him, like maybe he’s just down the hall brushing his teeth and will slip back past her and into the room at any moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     After he died, Agatha had spent every night curled on his rug beneath the yellow-green glow of the stars, not willing to disturb the bed but needing to be close by. Like maybe he would wake up in the cemetery and find his way home and slip back into his bed. He would need his mother close by to comfort him then, to fight off the lingering fear of that small, dark place she’d left him in.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio had shuffled in that first night with bloodshot eyes and tried to coax her into coming back to bed, Agatha had screamed at her until her throat was raw. Accused her of wanting to forget about him, of being selfish. Rio had walked out without a word, a look of pained shock frozen on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pretended not to hear her sobbing in the master bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     She steps towards the bed, running the soft, worn ear of the rabbit between her fingers. Her thumb catches on the little embroidered ‘N’ rio had sewn into it, scared he would take it to pre-school and it would fall into the clutches of some other sniveling toddler and never make it home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha takes a deep breath, closing her eyes. Slowly, she peels back the sodden bandages to peer at the infected wound of her grief, exposing the oozing flesh to the cool air so that she can ask it, like a goddamn magic 8 ball, if it would have been worse if they had known beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she’d had to watch him crumble slowly rather than all at once. If it had been not a desperate 911 call in the night but months of trips to specialists in Boston and tens of thousands of dollars poured into scraping together a few extra days with him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The truth, of course, is that it’s an impossible question and she’ll never get a clear answer. She might as well be asking if it’s preferable to be bludgeoned to death in one go or tortured for months on end until her heart gives out. Both agonizing, both unimaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha steps back from the bed, flicking the light off and quietly shutting the door once more before shuffling back to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
     The week passes with little fuss. On Thursday night, Agatha stays home.

   <div>
    <p>
     Agatha finds herself unwillingly adjusting to her new normal, where Wanda has started to frequently text her and Lilia hangs around at the end of Zoom meetings to gossip and her phone buzzes with unchecked notifications from the support group.
    </p>
    <p>
     It feels like being pried in half like an oyster, the knife blade sinking in to the hilt to ensure all of her hidden corners are exposed directly to the light.
    </p>
    <p>
     For three years she had painstakingly crafted a new life from the rubble of the one before it– a flimsy thing built on rage-fueled isolation and self reliance– only to be made to sit and watch as everyone takes their individual sledgehammers to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The coffee shop incident in February should have been an omen, Agatha now realizes. A warning sign that she needed to get the hell out of dodge.
    </p>
    <p>
     But of course she hadn’t. Instead, she’d held onto the stubborn belief that things would carry on in what she had come to believe was the natural order– a cycle that would repeat over and over until some other terrible thing came along and took even that.
    </p>
    <p>
     There had been no great collapse, though. No splitting apart of the sky, no final test for her to fail. Just a knock at her door. Just a stack of papers about a lawsuit dredging up every memory she can’t forget.
    </p>
    <p>
     The world is operating differently now than it was six months ago, and Agatha has made her unsteady peace with this fact.
    </p>
    <p>
     So when a knock sounds at her door at 9 p.m. on a Tuesday in the last week of May, Agatha pauses her show and sets down her wine glass before navigating from the couch to the foyer, tightening the knot on her robe as she goes. She almost misses the signs. Almost forgets.
    </p>
    <p>
     But when she’s close enough to see Rio’s silhouette through the distorted glass of the front door, Agatha freezes for just one moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     After her last house call, Agatha had thought that this part of the cycle must be over, no longer worth Rio’s time. Still, she waits on the other side of the door all the same, shifting from foot to foot. Patient, like she has no doubt that Agatha will answer eventually.
    </p>
    <p>
     Desire and embarrassment and indignation twine around one another in a heady cocktail and curl up the length of Agatha’s spine, mixing with the wine in her blood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had crossed the line after the meeting, had made a goddamn fool out of her in that bathroom. Rio had fucked her in public and walked away like it was nothing and yet she had the audacity to come home like nothing had changed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio has come home. Nothing has changed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha flings the front door open and pulls Rio through by the neck of her hoodie, blindly slamming it shut as she crashes their lips together. Her kiss is all take– a claim and a challenge– and Rio puts up the barest hint of a fight before succumbing to Agatha’s determination.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wrestles them both up the stairs, refusing to let them disconnect for even a second. There are nails dragging down skin and bruises sucked into a throat and the jerky removal of clothes, but never a separation.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time they reach the bedroom, Rio is bare and bruised, flushed and breathless. And yet, when Agatha shoves Rio down onto the bed and looks into her eyes for the first time tonight, something dull has settled behind her irises, something muted. She ignores the suspicion it brings to her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     No words are spoken between them. Not when Agatha sheds her robe, not when she flips Rio onto her stomach and pulls her hips into the air, not when she rakes her nails down the toned expanse of Rio’s back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only their harsh breathing permeates the room, their out-of-sync inhalations like nails on a chalkboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something is wrong here. Agatha can feel it, but it stays just out of her grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it only feels that way because the cycle has been disturbed by all of the other bullshit. Maybe it’s only that after hearing Rio’s voice so often in the past few months it feels odd to be deprived of it now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, that must be it. But this part has never come with the expectation of verbal interaction, only physical. So Agatha pushes away the strangeness and lowers her mouth to Rio’s waiting cunt, letting herself forget everything other than the taste and the sounds and the feeling of this.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wrings orgasm after orgasm out of her ex wife with her fingers and her mouth, stopping only when Rio’s hips fall back to the bed, shaking too hard to keep herself upright any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha licks her lips and wipes her hand on the bed, watching as Rio’s prone form continues to tremble. Though she can’t be sure exactly what triggers it, the alarm bell starts to ring in her head, her slowing pulse beginning to pick back up in her chest. Unsure how to turn it back off, Agatha slowly reaches a hand out toward Rio, leaving it hovering when she realizes she’s not sure what a safe place to touch would be. If there’s a safe place to touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio flips onto her back before Agatha can decide, finding her on her knees with one hand splayed in the air between them. Her face is devoid of makeup and of rage, holding something indecipherable in its stead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her cheeks are blotchy from where her face has been pressed into the bed, stray hairs sticking to her sweaty forehead. Agatha knows that the woman from the bathroom is still one and the same, only wearing a less visible set of armor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fangs could come out at any moment and tear their way through Agatha’s trachea. And still, she lets her hand finish its descent, tracing the tip of one nail from Rio’s shoulder down to the crook of her arm and letting her touch rest over the pulse there.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s not looking into Rio’s face, and so she doesn’t see when the veil that makes her thoughts illegible is lifted to reveal tonight’s weapon of choice: remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I shouldn’t have agreed to join the lawsuit for you. I could’ve just done it on my own but I roped you in anyway. That wasn’t fair,” Rio apologizes. The words come out thick, like she’s been holding them in her throat all night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha yanks her finger back from Rio’s arm as if burnt, finding her face with a nauseating shock.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Fair.
     </em>
     Rio hasn’t come here tonight because she missed Agatha– or at least sex with Agatha. She’s here because she knew that Agatha would take charge and in some fucked up, psychologically hellish sort of way, thought that it would be
     <em>
      fair.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Had let Agatha scratch and bite and fuck her, throw her around and make her scream, because then they would be even. An act of penance. A pity fuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bile rises to Agatha’s throat, burning in her nose, and she launches herself off the bed with record speed, hurtling into the bathroom and slamming the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She retches into the toilet, falling to her knees on the tile floor with a painful thud.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s not sure how long she stays there, dry heaving every time she thinks about it again until she’s finally sure her body must be empty. She feels dirty, though not from the sweat on her body or the vomit on her tongue or the remnants of Rio’s arousal between her fingers. Unclean in a way she knows will linger.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is no great collapse to the cycle, only this– an act of love turned into a battlefield turned into an emotionless transaction. A feeling that lands somewhere squarely between rejection and shame, souring in her gut.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio is long gone by the time Agatha leaves the bathroom. The only traces of her left behind are the slow-drying spots on the bed. Agatha spends the night on the couch.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     In the grainy video in the corner of her screen, Agatha wagers there’s a 50% chance that everyone else on this Zoom call can tell that she’s not paying attention, doodling little flowers and stars across her otherwise blank notebook page.
    </p>
    <p>
     She props up her chin with her hand, glancing back towards the screen every other minute or so just in case they’re talking about something that actually matters. It’s another client trying to decide how to run a ‘tasteful’ Pride campaign, though the month of June started days ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     When her phone buzzes where she’s left it face down on the desk, Agatha’s almost certain it’s a message from Lilia telling her to show some professionalism.
    </p>
    <p>
     Already crafting a snarky response in her head, Agatha sets her pen down and reaches out to the phone, flipping it over and scanning the message that lights up the screen. Her stomach drops, all of the nonchalance from a moment ago gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Rio:
     </b>
     <em>
      Stephen would like to do deposition prep with you on the 20th. We’ll be together for the actual hearing, but my schedule didn’t line up for this.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     A link to a calendar invite from Stephen follows the message.
    </p>
    <p>
     A cold dread pools in her veins, seeping from her heart and into her fingertips. How has a text from Rio even gone through? Agatha’s had her blocked for
     <em>
      years
     </em>
     –
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      That fucking snake
     </em>
     , she seethes. Rio must have unblocked herself while Agatha was in the bathroom last week. The thought makes her sick all over again. She eyes the trash can in the corner of her home office warily.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha forces herself to set the phone back down, pointing her eyes unseeingly back to the laptop. At least she’ll get to handle this prep meeting by herself and without the prying eyes of an audience. Agatha’s not afraid of Stephen or his stupid questions or whatever he thinks he can say to prepare her. She’s just frustrated is all. Displeased to have to waste her afternoon in another meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Opening her phone again to accept the invite and put the date in her calendar, Agatha grimaces. It’s the same day as Wanda’s big end of year party. Not that she was planning on going, but it still feels wrong to have had the choice taken from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She opens her messages back up to text Wanda as much, but pauses when the app opens back to her thread with Rio. Her eyes fall to the small contact photo, unchanged from when she’d set it nearly a decade ago. It’s nothing more than a candid shot of Rio on their couch, taken while she’d been animatedly explaining some niche fact or another to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even in its distorted, pixelated form Agatha can see the light in her eyes, the pure joy radiating off of her. She can almost slip into her old skin and remember what it felt like to love and be loved that much, to the point where a silly off-center photo of someone can rival the Mona Lisa in your mind’s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tries to compare the woman in the photo to the woman from last week, cold and unfeeling in her bed. Calculating enough that she took the time to unblock herself while Agatha was violently sick just on the other side of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Rio had been right. Maybe she never really knew her at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolls her tense shoulders before finally clicking away, shooting off her text to Wanda. When she looks back to her laptop, everyone is waiting for her to present.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha pulls into the parking lot of the law firm for the second time, she is considerably less nervous. She gets out of her car and walks straight to the doors, easily riding the elevator up and navigating back down the same halls. This time she doesn’t stop at the conference room but instead walks three doors down to where a little plaque reads
     <em>
      Stephen Strange, Partner.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She knocks on the cracked door, rolling her eyes at his overly cheery “come in!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slips in and closes the door behind her. Though he seems to be high up at the firm, Strange’s office is remarkably cramped, covered in binders and books of laws and scattered pens. The desk he sits behind is cheaply made and Agatha can see a rip in the arm of his chair beneath the sleeve of his suit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ms. Harkness, it’s so nice to see you again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He rises to shake Agatha’s hand before settling back down, motioning for her to take the chair on the opposite side. She complies, smoothing her hands over her navy slacks and straightening out her white button up before crossing her legs and folding her hands in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wonders if he’ll put them both through the torture of small talk. Luckily, this doesn’t seem to be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know this may be a bit difficult, but the Perlman Clinic has hired some of the most notoriously ruthless defense lawyers in Massachusetts, so we have to be sure all of our bases are covered. Some of the questions they ask will feel like an overreach and if I can object to any of them I will, but we have to be prepared to give them answers in a way that they can’t use against us. Does that make sense?” He explains, his tone polite but gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, Stephen, I understand how a deposition works. Now give me the questions, I don’t have all day.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, but let me know if you need a break at any point.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nods, motioning with her hand for him to continue. Strange opens the manilla folder in front of him on the desk and clicks his pen, beginning down a line of questions he seems to have printed just for the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, first question. Why did you and Ms. Vidal use a donor?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorts, surprised. “Neither of us has a dick, sadly, and we couldn’t figure out the right spell to make him from scratch.” Strange nods, jotting something down and ignoring her sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why did you choose the Perlman Clinic?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because we lived in the city at the time and it made geographical sense. Plus they seemed reputable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The lawyer grimaces, writing down notes beneath the question. “Maybe we stay away from calling them reputable. They might turn it back around later to cast doubt on their wrongdoings.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilts her head, not having considered that angle. Maybe Stephen has his job for a reason, she concedes, though she’ll never say as much.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Next question. What exactly did the doctors say was Nicholas’ cause of death?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha falters for the first time, unconsciously tightening her fingers in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They said he had a ruptured aneurysm in his brain that caused a hemorrhagic stroke. In the autopsy they found that he had an aortic aneurysm too, but that it hadn’t ruptured and he hadn’t had any symptoms that we could have noticed. So I guess the aneurysm caused the stroke caused his death,” she finishes, tapering off as she catches herself rambling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Strange nods, his face a mask of concentration as he looks down at his sheet. “You can’t say ‘I guess,’ they’ll swoop in like vultures,” he says with little inflection, like he’s forgotten she’s there.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But that all lines up with the autopsy report and the notes from his doctors that I have here,” he adds, flipping through the other papers in the folder to check himself. Agatha’s stomach clenches when she sees a copy of his birth certificate. It must have all come from Rio, then. The indignant rage prickles at the base of her skull.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you or did you not believe that your son’s death was a result of wrongdoing by the Perlman Clinic at any point before you were approached about this lawsuit?”
    </p>
    <p>
     This one Agatha takes a moment to consider, letting herself parse through her thoughts before she speaks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think– I mean, the doctors were very clear that it was a genetic abnormality that caused Nicky’s aneurysms, and the two sets of genes in his body were from Rio and from the donor. Rio did a genetic screening before we harvested her eggs and her results were clear.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Strange nods, settling in like that’s exactly what he expected her to bring up. Unsettled, Agatha shifts in her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You said you and Ms. Vidal utilized her egg to conceive your son. At the time that you made this decision, you were aware that Ms. Vidal did not have knowledge of her own family medical history nor did she have a way to access that information. Is that correct?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Puzzled, Agatha can only answer honestly. “Yes?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And are you aware that while genetic screening is an important tool, one’s family medical history can often help to identify individuals with a higher risk of less common genetic conditions that are not readily detectable through genetic screening?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mouth goes dry, and when she swallows it feels like rubbing sandpaper against the walls of her throat. “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ms. Harkness, can you explain why you used Ms. Vidal’s egg to conceive your son when her genetic makeup was guesswork at best, leaving Nicholas vulnerable to a whole host of potential ailments?”
    </p>
    <p>
     There are a million and one true answers to Stephen Strange’s question, and not one of them will be what he wants to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had agreed to use Rio’s egg because of a childhood spent in a house with Evanora Harkness, where a beating was as commonplace as a bedtime story is for some children. There were nights of being sent to bed without dinner and days of tip toeing around, desperate to avoid Evanora’s wrath, desperate to just be good enough that she would spare Agatha the belt.
    </p>
    <p>
     She thinks about years of hatred and abuse ingrained so deep in her bones that she still wakes up in the middle of the night with a racing pulse, gasping for air and unable to calm down until she’s sure she’s not in that house anymore, that she really made it out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nearly shy even just in her own mind, Agatha remembers that she had agreed to use Rio’s egg because she knew that she could save her baby by giving him all of Rio’s goodness and none of her own cursed blood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had chosen to use Rio’s egg because of the girl that she met in freshman year orientation who had become her wife, winning her over with flowers and terrible jokes and that same sharp, dark edge that she had always recognized in herself. The girl that had lost her parents before she could talk and had been tossed from foster home to foster home until she aged out of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had done it because there had been nobody else in the world that shared the brilliant and beautiful DNA of Rio Vidal, and that thought had been too heartbreaking to bear. In using her egg Agatha would get to see that radiant smile in two faces and not just one, and that had been reason enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     She takes a shuddering breath, hoping it will steady her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because it was what made sense for us. Rio’s test results displayed no concerning results regarding aneurysms, strokes, or any of the other disorders that could increase their likelihood. She was perfect.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Strange looks like he might have something to say, but he looks back down at the paper instead, leaving a note and nodding at Agatha encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     They work their way through another swath of questions, hammering down the details of the timeline of their involvement with the clinic, specific choices about the donor that they used, and the prenatal care that Agatha received.
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as he suggests they call it a day Agatha shoots from her chair, offering a terse goodbye and throwing herself back out into the hallway. Only when she makes it to the safe chrome doors of the elevator does she exhale, closing her eyes and rubbing at her aching temples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      That was just the prep
     </em>
     , she reminds herself.
     <em>
      That was him going easy on you
     </em>
     . Agatha squeezes her eyes tighter, only popping them open again when the elevator ding notifies her she’s made it back to the lobby.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sick dread that has been building since Rio showed up at her door seems to have increased tenfold, weighing her down and slowing her steps.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s going to have to do that again, but with Rio next to her and some hotshot lawyers that will be out for blood asking the questions. She’ll have to relive it all again and worse– will have to listen to Rio talk about it too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Back in her car, Agatha drives without thought to the cemetery, parking in her usual spot. From the trunk she retrieves the pretty fake flowers she’d picked up the week before and carries them over to his grave, kneeling directly onto the grass and getting to work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha brushes off the headstone with her hands, clearing away dirt and twigs and grass shavings. With a tissue from her pocket she wipes out the divots of the lettering, making sure each dip and curve is pristine. When she’s done, Agatha pulls the last set of plastic flowers she left from their vase and replaces them with the ones she brought– shiny sunflowers and lilies.
    </p>
    <p>
     Studiously she ignores the very real bouquet that Rio has clearly left on the other side of the headstone, flowering beautifully in a thick ceramic vase and surrounding her with their fresh scent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha doesn’t speak to him while she cleans like she normally would, too caught up in the wounds that had been reopened in Strange’s office. He knows she’s there anyway, surely.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she runs out of tasks Agatha sits back on her heels, the sharp ends of her pumps digging into her ass through her slacks. She sets her hands on her knees, bracing her arms and taking a moment to breathe. The breeze pushes her hair where it hangs around her face, and Agatha tries for several long minutes to get herself together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally she sighs, leaning over and pressing her fingers past the grass and into the cool earth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know you would want me to help them. You always told me to just be brave,” she whispers brokenly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha feels a tear slip past her lashes and down the curve of her nose, watches it fall and disappear into the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is
     <em>
      so hard
     </em>
     to be brave without you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She lets herself cry for the first time in a long time before she hears another car door shut somewhere in the cemetery, reminding her that this is not the time or the place. Wiping her eyes, Agatha grabs the old flowers, drops a kiss to Nicky’s headstone, and goes home.

    <p>
     The ghosts in Agatha’s house grow more restless after her deposition prep.
    </p>
    <p>
     They wake her in the night to a cold sweat and a jarring sense of loneliness, or bear down when she makes her tea in the morning. It leaves her on edge in a way that she thinks no one has noticed, until Lilia wraps up their team meeting with a request for Agatha to stay on.
    </p>
    <p>
     From the mounted camera that Lilia uses in her office, Agatha can see the full image of her boss seated at her desk, somehow managing to level her with an unimpressed look all the way from Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t know what that lawyer said to you, but it’s got you off your game. You’ve been too quiet,” Lilia says once they’re alone on the call. As always, there’s no question she’s asking, no argument she’s looking for. Just the opening of a door with the option to walk through it. Agatha twirls her pen around in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Would you rather I be louder? You’re always telling me to chill out in meetings anyway,” Agatha deflects. Lilia shakes her head, pursing her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t tell you to ‘chill out,’” she makes air quotes around the words with her fingers. “I ask you not to call people names or make threats of violence. I never said you couldn’t be loud.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolls her eyes, waving a hand at her computer screen as if to say
     <em>
      same thing
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe you should try out that support group that the other plaintiffs have. Aren’t they meeting tonight?” Lilia presses. Silently, Agatha berates herself once more for her stupidity. She’d added the meetings to her calendar, forgetting to set them to private. Lilia had asked about it almost immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And subject myself to a cesspool of other people’s wallowing? Fat chance.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How could it be worse than the cesspool of your own wallowing? At least regular sad people make excellent baked goods, so you can count on that. Plus I bet your friends Allie and Jade will be there,” she cajoles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Against her better judgement, Agatha feels herself starting to wear down. It’s only been a few days since she'd been in Stephen's office, but she’s yet to escape the stain it’s left– a lingering anxiety not unlike that of a prey animal. A night spent with the support group would at least mean less time spent in her own house.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Their names are Alice and Jen, Calderu. And they’re not my friends.” Lilia’s cackling laugh is the last thing Agatha hears before hanging up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Standing in front of her bedroom mirror at 5:30, knowing she has to leave soon if she’s going to make it at all, Agatha gives her outfit a final once over. She’s gone for something simple– not entirely sure what to expect from this crowd– in a pair of loose linen pants and a plain black top. Her sunglasses serve as a headband where they’re perched atop her head and her strappy black platform sandals give her the confidence boost of a few extra inches.
    </p>
    <p>
     She twists her watch on her wrist and smooths out her wrinkle-free pants one last time.
     <em>
      There’s no reason to be nervous
     </em>
     , she reminds herself. Nobody will be looking for her weaknesses or trying to knock her off balance. They have too much of their own shit going on.
    </p>
    <p>
     And if it’s awful, she can just leave. There’s always that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pulling up to the parking lot outside of the local middle school gym feels weird in a way that Agatha can’t entirely put her finger on. Part of it is being at a school in the summer time, with its hushed, empty halls and vacant bus lot. Part is surely being a grown woman walking up to those wide double doors by herself, giving a wary side eye to the painted cartoon horse and its “Go Stallions!” speech bubble.
    </p>
    <p>
     Part of it is knowing that he would have been here this year. That she would have driven this route to drop him off and pick him up five days a week from August to June.
    </p>
    <p>
     The gymnasium doors squeal open when Agatha pushes through. The small lobby is empty, the metal shutters pulled over the concession stand. Doors with little windows lead into the gym on either side of a large wooden trophy case, and Agatha peers curiously through the nearest one.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the shiny wooden floors, several small groups of adults are milling about, chatting with one another. To one side, she sees a white plastic folding table boasting paper plates and an assortment of cookies and sandwiches, a pitcher of lemonade and a stack of cups on the far end.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Lilia was right about regular sad people and baking.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the far side of the gym Agatha can make out a group of kids of varying ages playing some sort of game with a basketball. There aren’t many of them, she notices. Not nearly as many as the adults.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha finishes her scan, torn between going inside to prove that she can and bolting back to the safety of her car. The decision is made for her when she catches motion in the side of her vision and turns her head, finding Alice offering her a slight wave. Jen and the other couple they must be talking to all turn to look at her and Agatha feels her face flush.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not wanting to linger in the sensation, she turns the handle and steps into the gym, taken aback by the sharp smell of the wax used to buff the floors and the hum of the fluorescent overhead lights. Some heads turn, but mostly people stick to their conversations, absorbed in their own worlds.
     <em>
      Good
     </em>
     . That’s what she’d been hoping for.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice steps away from the group to greet Agatha, offering a small smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey. I’m glad you could come.” Alice seems genuinely pleased, leaving the weeks that have passed since she first told Agatha about the group unacknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha crosses her arms over her chest, not in defense but like a security blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks,” she shrugs. “I had deposition prep with Stephen this week. Figured I’d see if it sucked ass for everyone else too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice huffs a laugh. “Dude, it felt like getting my shit rocked. At one point Jen had to physically get up and take a lap of the building to calm down.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha breathes a small sigh of relief. At least it had been just as bad for the others and she wasn’t some anomaly in her weakness. Her eyes start to wander around the room again, taking in the attendees without the window’s blur distorting their features. Noticing, Alice takes a half step closer, lowering her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Those,” she nods to a younger couple, teary-eyed and whispering to each other by the snack table, “are the Haymans. Their baby only lived a year, died back in February. A cardiovascular thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice shifts, gesturing to a tall, muscular woman with short-cropped blonde hair listening attentively to an older couple. “That’s Carol. Her daughter’s been dead a while, I think, but she doesn’t really talk about it.” She tilts her head, like she’s just remembered something.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A lot of people can’t make it every time, since the clinic is in Boston and lots of people traveled to it in the first place. We’re a bit scattered around the state, so it’s nice when people can stop by.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice gives similar synopses for the majority of the attendees, loading Agatha down with faces and names she’d be hard pressed to remember with a gun to her head. It was one thing to see all of the names on the group’s page, but it’s another to see several of them here in person, real people living real lives and not just pictures on a screen.
    </p>
    <p>
     It feels like finally seeing the invisible string tying her to the rest of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tries not to be, but Agatha’s surprised Rio isn't here. Whether it’s relief or disappointment, though, she can’t tell. The feelings tangle up in her chest, knotting over themselves. The only certainty is that it feels strange.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And those,” Alice sighs, finally reaching the end of her introduction speech and motioning to the couple still talking to a clearly over it Jen, “are the Kaplans. They were the second couple to join the suit. And they come to every meeting.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Without another word, Alice strides back over to her previous position. “Jeff, Rebecca, this is Agatha,” Alice says, donning what must be her hostess tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     With no other option, Agatha wills her feet forward, inserting herself into their little circle between a visibly relieved Jen and Rebecca, offering what she hopes comes off as a smile and not the grimace that it is.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hi there, Agatha! It’s so nice to meet you. Any friend of Alice and Jen’s is a friend of ours!” Jeff winks, offering his hand. Agatha suppresses an eye roll and shakes the offered palm, turning to do the same to Rebecca. She remembers she’s supposed to verbally respond, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hello. Nice to meet you both.” It feels sufficient. Rebecca offers a warm smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     They’re older than she is by at least a decade, if she had to guess. Jeff is starting to bald and Rebecca’s dark hair is noticeably greying, the laugh lines around her eyes visible even when her face relaxes. They seem far more chipper than the somber atmosphere that she’d been expecting.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We were so glad to hear that another couple was joining the lawsuit. It’s just so important, you know? To be able to do this for our kids,” Rebecca explains. Her gentle voice blares like an air horn against Agatha’s ear drum. Before Agatha can correct her Jeff nods along, putting an arm around his wife’s shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Our William had NF1. The doctors told us not to worry, but one of his tumors ended up being cancer,” Jeff explains, a bittersweet smile on his face and a tone that says
     <em>
      what can you do?
     </em>
     “We got fifteen fantastic years with our boy though, and we wouldn’t trade ‘em for anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As he talks Jeff pulls his phone from his pocket, turning the screen to face Agatha. It’s a photo of a teen lounging on a couch, sporting the thickest rings of eyeliner Agatha thinks she’s ever seen. His mop of dark, curly hair flops down to his eyebrows, drawing focus to the metal rod pierced through one.
    </p>
    <p>
     His smile looks forced but good-humored, like he knows exactly why his dad wants to take so many pictures of him but still has that teenage desire to push back.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Kaplans seem like they love talking about William and will take any excuse to do so– confirmed by a sideways glance at Alice and Jen, who have undoubtedly heard this same spiel a thousand times.
    </p>
    <p>
     Theirs is nothing like her own life, but it still feels like pressing on a bruise, exacerbated by the overstimulation of the whole evening. Agatha smiles, knowing it doesn’t reach her eyes. “He seems like a good kid.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The Kaplans light up, like that was exactly what they’d hoped she would say. Like there’s anything else you’re allowed to say when presented with a picture of someone’s dead kid. Jeff pockets the phone again, turning that same cheery smile back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sure Nicky was a very sweet boy too, Agatha. We met Rio a few weeks back– what a wonderful woman. With parents like you two, I’m sure any kid would be very loved,” he nods, as if moved by his own words.
    </p>
    <p>
     At her side, Agatha can see Alice and Jen exchange a look. She can’t think about that, though. She’s too busy trying not to vomit on everyone’s shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe the Nicky stuff she could have expected. Jeff is clearly trying, in his oblivious white man way, to give her space to talk about her son in a room full of people that are probably all about that sort of thing. But she hadn’t come here to be reminded of the past, to be made to think about their time as mothers or what a
     <em>
      wonderful woman
     </em>
     Rio is. If anything, she'd come to let other people's anxieties drown out her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hunted feeling that had stayed with her since Stephen’s office ratchets up in her chest, like the sniper’s sights are trained between her eyes and it’s either she makes a run for it or lets her brain matter paint the floor like a runny egg yolk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you all would excuse me, I have got to piss like a racehorse.” She gestures vaguely behind herself with a thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha catches the sign on the far end of the gym and turns on her heel, walking past Carol and the snack table and the weepy couple that has settled on the bleachers. Giving a wide berth to the gaggle of children around the hoop, Agatha swings down a side hall and into the bathroom, which turns out to be the girls’ locker room.
    </p>
    <p>
     It reeks of a thousand different Bath &amp; Body Works perfume scents, all sprayed ten times more than necessary and mixing with one another into a noxious cloud. Agatha curves away from the row of lockers to a line of sinks, gripping the edge of the nearest one staring into her reflection.
     <em>
      It’s nothing, Harkness. This is nothing.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulls a paper towel from the dispenser on the wall, dampening it in the sink and patting gingerly at her forehead. Her hands are shaking, she realizes, and why are all of these lights so fucking bright?
    </p>
    <p>
     She shouldn’t have come to this fuck ass meeting, shouldn’t have taken Lilia’s awful advice. Rio should never have signed them up for this thing in the first place– should never had agreed on her behalf and certainly shouldn’t have shown up at her house and apologized for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And where the fuck is Rio anyway? Why is she not here? Sure, Agatha hadn’t told her that she would come tonight despite her number being unblocked. But
     <em>
      why
     </em>
     hadn’t she come?
    </p>
    <p>
     And who do these people think they are, prying their grubby little fingers into her business? How is she supposed to fend them off without breaking any of the rules of polite society? How do people even survive events like this, really? Rio always knew how to play the part, waltzing through insufferable conversations like they were a silly dance she’d been born knowing the steps to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nobody ever guessed that she was just as annoyed or pissed off or entertained as Agatha, missing all of her small tells. Agatha never missed them, though. Always caught the widening of her eyes or the strain of her smiles or the barely there flit of her gaze to meet her own. Agatha only knows full speed, full volume.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hears the door swing open again and takes a steadying breath, wringing excess water from her paper towel into the sink. Jen catches her eye in the mirror behind her for less than a second, continuing past and stopping in front of the full length mirror at the end of the row of sinks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha spares herself another quick glance in the mirror, confirming that she still looks composed and not like a total basket case. But it doesn’t seem to matter, because Jen is simply adjusting her jewelry, twisting her layered necklaces and tightening the back of her earring, not looking at Agatha at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not yet ready to leave the bathroom but without another task, Agatha begins the motions of washing her hands. She almost misses it when Jen starts to speak. her tone almost bored.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jeff is so fucking nosy. I swear to god if he tries to give me one more sympathy hug, I am going to slap him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, caught off guard by her candor, snorts a quiet laugh. She keeps her eyes on her hands when the silence falls again. Jen uncaps a lipstick from her pocket with a
     <em>
      pop
     </em>
     , leaning forward to apply the pigment with a light hand and inspecting her work.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t want to have to come to this pathetic support group or hear about how everyone’s kids are dead. I don’t want them to ogle my living child or deal with their questions about how sick she is or spend every other Thursday night in this nasty pre-teen hellscape.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She pauses, swiping the nail of her pinky delicately along her bottom lip to clean up her lip line before leaning back and finally looking over at Agatha, who has given up the ruse of washing her hands to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But it’s what Alice needs to feel in control. So, here I am.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha considers Jen for a moment, feeling her panic ebb slightly at the words. Still, something nags at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you saying any of this to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     It comes out more defensive than she intends. Because while Jen doesn’t seem like the type, Agatha wonders if this is how she exhibits pity. But Jen only gives her what is possibly the largest eye roll she’s ever seen, crossing her arms across her chest like she cannot believe how dense Agatha is.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Because,
     </em>
     you seem like you’re always one stupid comment away from blowing up on everyone in a three mile radius, and it can be helpful to know that you’re not the only miserable person here.” Jen tilts her head, a mirror of Alice an hour before.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And because I’m afraid that if she dies, I’ll turn into you,” she says with a shrug, like that’s something normal to say to a person, before walking straight past Agatha and back out of the locker room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha doesn’t know if she should be flattered or offended, finding herself adrift in the murky sea between the two. But she does know one thing for sure– Jen isn’t handling any of this better than Alice is. She’s just handling it quieter.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Jen is just as unwilling to share Lorna as she is to share Nicky, she realizes. Maybe if he was still alive, she’d put up less of a fight, too. Would do damn near anything if it felt like a way to get the upper hand somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha runs a hand down her face, resolving to let herself slip out the back and just walk around the outside of the building to get back to her car. Certainly it would be a better fate than subjecting herself to the Kaplans or facing Jen and Alice's knowing looks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just as she makes her way back down the short hallway and sets her eyes on a back exit, Agatha catches a tiny mass of dark hair and brown, watchful eyes in her path. Lorna tugs at a stray curl, her pink shirt boasting a stain that looks like a parting gift from a popsicle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you leaving?” She asks, her small voice full of youthful curiosity. Agatha nods, feeling herself shift into someone gentler.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, I need to head home. It’s almost my bedtime.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She gives a smile, but Lorna only looks at her– the spitting image of Alice with that off putting, all-seeing expression. Finally, she smiles back, showing off the gap left by a missing tooth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay. Bye!” And then she’s gone as quickly as she came, heading back to the gaggle of kids. Agatha’s eyes follow her, feeling something in her chest begin to shift.
    </p>
    <p>
     She can feel a set of eyes watching her and knows that it’s Jen. Agatha doesn’t look back as she leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
     The drive home is thankfully easy, and Agatha beelines for the kitchen as soon as she makes it inside. She pulls the bottle from the fridge and pours herself an arguably large glass of wine, immediately bringing it to her lips and taking a gulp before placing the glass on the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha breathes in through her nose, letting go of a shaky exhale. This whole thing needs to be over so that she can go back to how things were. Yes, the past several years had been agonizing, but at least it was the kind of pain that she’d adjusted to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Frogs in boiling water and all that.
    </p>
    <p>
     This new normal is like being burnt at the stake– the slow, precise rise of the flames and the knowledge that everyone around is going to watch her flail and cry for help and that there’s nothing she can do to make it stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha has always been good at internalizing her problems, folding them smaller and smaller inside of herself and lashing out to alleviate the pressure when it became too much. If the problems stay inside of her, then nobody else can be shredded apart by the inevitable implosion. That's what she'd learned last time.
    </p>
    <p>
     If all of it stays buried in her chest and in her hands and behind her teeth, then Agatha can be the only casualty. It’s safest this way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her phone buzzes in her pocket and she slides it out, figuring it must be Alice asking where she is after her Irish goodbye.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Rio:

     <em>
      Strange says Perlman’s lawyers are settling on a date for our hearing. Lmk if early August works for you.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The frustrated spiral she’d been having before Jen entered the locker room returns, pounding in her ears and throat. While Agatha reads the text, those three little dots appear. She watches the little typing animation, her anticipation increasing by the second.
    </p>
    <p>
     After another minute, a second text comes through. It’s a link to the support group chat with a brief, impersonal message below it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Rio:
     </b>
     <em>
      In case you’re interested.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agitated, Agatha’s thumbs hover over the screen of her phone, ready to fire off a response.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I was there tonight. Where were you?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She erases it immediately, tries again to convey how she feels.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      A little late for that. I fucked Rebecca Kaplan in the girls locker room.

    </p>

    <p>
     <em>
      It was unbearable to be there without you. All of this is unbearable without you.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha catches herself, watches her fingers type the words in horror. As if it burns in her hands, Agatha throws her phone over the kitchen island and listens as it lands with a harsh
     <em>
      smack
     </em>
     on the wooden floors of the living room, sliding until it hits the leg of the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pinches the bridge of her nose between her fingers, realizing several seconds too late how fucking stupid that was. How fucking stupid everything in the whole world is, actually.
    </p>
    <p>
     She retrieves the phone, picking it up and turning it over to find a long crack down the middle of the screen.
     <em>
      Fantastic.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stops back in the kitchen, downing the rest of her wine and depositing the glass in the sink before heading up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hopefully the alcohol will dull tonight’s nightmare of choice, if nothing else.

   <div>
    <p>
     In a momentary lapse in judgement, Agatha agreed to attend family dinner at the Maximoffs’ as penance for missing their end of year party.
    </p>
    <p>
     The end of year party that she hadn’t intended to go to in the first place. That she’d missed because she was forced to endure two torturous hours of being pelted with invasive questions in Stephen Strange’s office. So if anything, Agatha’s pretty sure she’s being punished for being punished.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nonetheless, Agatha has made her way down the street in a casual black sundress on the last evening in June to the familiar house, catching the big red ‘M’ painted elegantly on the mailbox at the end of the driveway. She grips the tupperware tighter between her hands as she ascends the steps to the front porch, suddenly more nervous than she thought she’d be.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s a mix of knowing that she’s walking into the first social situation in a while that she can’t just up and leave when things get to be too much and that Billy and Tommy’s attention will be on her, scrutinizing in the way that children can’t help but be.
    </p>
    <p>
     She takes a breath, flicking her hair back over her shoulder and fortifying herself.
     <em>
      I am not afraid of Wanda Maximoff or her pet man or their demon spawn.
     </em>
     Agatha lifts a hand and rings the doorbell.
    </p>
    <p>
     Within seconds she can hear footsteps bounding around a corner and up to the other side of the door, culminating in the wood swinging open to reveal a panting Billy, wearing a slightly rumpled Transformers t-shirt and a pair of mismatched socks.
    </p>
    <p>
     He opens his mouth, presumably to greet her, but his voice catches when his eyes land on the tupperware in her hands. His eyes seem to bulge out of his head, and Agatha can almost see him begin to vibrate with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
     “SHE MADE THE BROWNIES,” he yells, pummeling her with his ten year old voice from a foot away. From somewhere within the house, Tommy gives a responding screech and begins barreling to the door to see the treasure with his own eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     There had been a time when Agatha was rather notorious for said brownies, bringing them to neighborhood events or having a fresh pan at the house when the kids would come to play. Mothers had begged for the recipe and their children begged for her to bring them to their birthday parties, but she’d never given up the recipe and never made them under threat of duress.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was in the second trimester of her pregnancy that Agatha had woken in a panic, shaking Rio so aggressively that she had sprung out of the bed in her underwear and started packing things at random, convinced Agatha was going into premature labor.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” she’d whispered urgently. “Mothers are supposed to know how to bake things. I can’t even make cookies from the tube!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had held her through the hormone-induced tears that had followed, very valiantly holding in her laughter because they both knew Agatha didn't really give a fuck about being able to bake anything. It was that she was afraid of all the things she didn’t know– all of the things that were supposed to come naturally but hadn’t to her own mother and maybe wouldn’t to her, either.
    </p>
    <p>
     They baked over twelve trays of brownies in the following weeks, formulating a recipe and tweaking it until it felt like something good enough to give their baby. And it certainly didn’t hurt that other people loved them so much, too. The sugar was a balm to the sting of Agatha’s dry humor and cutting remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’d almost forgotten how much of a secret weapon they had been, but the reaction she receives now jogs her memory. From behind Billy and Tommy, Agatha catches the faint smell of something delicious in the kitchen and the soft sounds of jazz music from Vision’s record player.
    </p>
    <p>
     The twins ogle the container in her hands, the pair of them stunned into silence at the promise of an impending sugar high. Agatha shifts her weight awkwardly and the beams of the porch groan with the motion. She debates the merits of throwing the brownies into the house behind them as a distraction and making a run for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s disembodied voice from the kitchen stops that line of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Boys, stop letting the air out and let Ms. Agatha in. If you keep gaping at her she’s going to run away and take those brownies with her,” she calls, like she can see the exact expressions on their face.
    </p>
    <p>
     The boys’ wide-eyed awe on the container pivots to fear and they scamper aside, clearing the way for Agatha to walk past.
    </p>
    <p>
     She does as much– muscle memory carrying her through the foyer and into the house. Agatha passes the couch covered in scattered action figures and catches a glimpse of Vision through the sliding glass door, deep in concentration on the back deck, manning the grill in some stupid green apron that reads
     <em>
      KISS ME. I’M NOT IRISH BUT I AM BEGGING
     </em>
     in big block letters.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha fights the urge to point and laugh, bypassing the dining table to step up to the kitchen island, where she finds Wanda on the other side stirring something on the stovetop and smiling back at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, I’m glad you could make it,” she says, scooting a stemless wine glass filled with something sparkling towards Agatha, a matching one resting on the counter near Wanda’s waist. Agatha pulls the glass the rest of the way towards herself after depositing the tupperware in its place like they’re bartering.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I said that I would be here,” Agatha responds dismissively, trying to free Wanda from any perception that she needs to be performing for her. But Wanda keeps her smile, sparing a glance to check on whatever’s in the pot.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It doesn’t mean I can’t be glad anyway.” Her playful retort pulls a responding eye roll from Agatha, but she can’t fight the upward quirk of her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unlike at the support group meeting, Agatha can be almost certain that Wanda isn’t going to send her careening into dangerous territory. This evening will surely be a pain in its own special way, but not the kind that poses a risk to her sanity. Or her phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha takes in her surroundings more fully, realizing there are already multiple plates laden with side dishes spread around Wanda and remembering that Vision was also on the grill. She furrows her brow.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda, you do realize there are only five of us, right?” She asks, wondering if Wanda has invited 20 to 30 other people and forgotten to tell her. The thought has her pulse picking up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda pulls the pot from the burner, setting it aside to cool. “Agatha, you do realize I have two boys, right? They eat like fucking bottomless pits. It’s obscene.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As if on cue, the bottomless pits in question wander out from what Agatha remembers being a playroom and into the kitchen, sidling up near Wanda.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is dinner almost ready?” Tommy asks, looking for all the world like a starving puppy in an ASPCA commercial. Wanda merely ruffles his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Almost. Go see if your dad needs help with anything outside.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They offer her mock salutes like agents accepting an important mission before tearing back out of the room and through the sliding door. Something inside of Agatha twists sharply, like she’s forgotten to bring something irreplaceable along with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she brought the brownies and she brought herself. She doesn’t have anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her phone buzzes in her pocket, saving her from the feeling. Agatha slides it out and reads the message, but it’s only the support group announcing a change in meeting time for the week, or something just as inconsequential.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she puts the device away and brings her eyes back up, Agatha finds Wanda looking at her expectantly, like she’s asked a question. She feels caught somehow, offering a grimace that could almost be construed as an apology.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you repeat that? I thought it was something important but it was just a group text,” she explains, waving her hand dismissively. Wanda lifts her brows, and it takes Agatha a second to pinpoint her intrigue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Since when do you tolerate a group text? I seem to remember an incident where you threatened to block everyone in the neighborhood if they tried to put you in one of those things.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chews on her bottom lip, leaning into the island counter and watching Wanda move around the kitchen. After a brief internal debate, she begins her explanation with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Remember the lawsuit thing I told you about?” Wanda nods.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There’s this group of some of the plaintiffs that get together and, seemingly, compound their wallowing like every other week. Alice and Jen– the women we saw on the trail– are kind of spearheading the whole thing.” The explanation feels sufficient, but Wanda looks at her over the rim of her wine glass, no longer moving.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you think it’s such a pity party, why are you in the group chat?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha crosses her arms defensively, licking her dry lips to buy herself some time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have to be involved in all of the other business anyway. And it’s the easiest way to find out if hearing dates change or whatever.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda nods, unperturbed by Agatha’s visible discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, at least you seem to get along with Alice and Jen well enough,” Wanda offers, but Agatha scrunches her face, fighting the urge to bare her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They keep trying to get under my skin, the both of them. It’s like every conversation has to be a
     <em>
      thing
     </em>
     . We can never just talk about…I don’t know, the weather?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda snorts a laugh, setting her wine down and moving to fill both of their glasses before looking back to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have never once wanted to talk about the weather, Agatha. Are these people actually trying to get under your skin or are they just, you know, getting close to you and that feels scary?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda doesn’t wait for her to respond (though to be clear, her response would have been
     <em>
      fuck all the way off
     </em>
     ) before picking up a plate in each hand. Agatha does the same, following her out to the back deck. They set the plates on the large iron table in the center of the patio, ringed with matching chairs and sporting a large umbrella through the center.
    </p>
    <p>
     The table already boasts plates of hot dogs and burgers and grilled vegetables, and Agatha adds the pasta salad and peach and goat cheese salad she’s carried out to the bounty. Wanda calls the boys to help grab a slew of other things still in the kitchen, and by the time they’re done Agatha’s not sure the table will stay up beneath all the weight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Vision claps his hands together once they’re all seated, having thankfully taken off his apron.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well everybody, this food won’t eat itself. Let’s dig in!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watches absently as the boys do just that, elbowing one another in the process. The summer scenery around them is beautiful– the cicadas are singing, the sun paints everything in a honey gold hue, and the grass and trees are such a vibrant shade of green that they almost look fake.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s caught between relaxing into the comfort of good food and a nice evening and thrashing against the sense of normalcy that her brain screams is false. An itchy feeling settles beneath her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then the boys are talking to her, their mouths full and their eyes alight. Tommy launches into an account of their end of school year party and Billy chimes in with details as he sees fit, the two of them painting a vivid picture of water balloons and face paint and store bought sugar cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy pivots away, his eager mind latching onto a different topic, and very seriously begins to tell her about how he’s learning to roller skate but still falls down a lot. He points to a scrape on his elbow as if to verify.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well if Billy keeps falling then we won’t grow even and I’ll be the tallest kid in fifth grade all by myself,” Tommy asserts around a mouthful of hot dog, to which Billy shoots him a heated look.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha soaks in their eager chatter, her delight at not having to talk about herself overpowering any annoyance she feels.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think it’ll be pretty hard to be the tallest kid if you’re only three feet tall, Tim. Are the other kids ants?” She taunts, slipping back into the playful snark she’s always donned for the kids. Tommy’s mouth falls open in outrage, a hand flying to his chest to up the drama. Wanda rolls her eyes at the theatrics.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     three feet tall! I’m four foot nine and my name is Tommy, Ms. Agatha!” He whines. Agatha takes a sip of her wine, making a sound like ‘I don’t know about that,’ which only eggs Tommy on further. Billy takes up her mantle, much to Wanda and Vision’s chagrin.
    </p>
    <p>
     The boys bloom under her direct attention, alight with the feeling of being seen by an adult that isn’t one of their parents. With a pang, Agatha realizes that she’s missed this. Not only had she lost Nicky, but the past three years have taken this from her, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     The twins are so much older now– their personalities haven’t changed much, but Agatha finds that they’re so much more articulate, so thoughtful. They’re becoming people.
    </p>
    <p>
     She blinks against the unexpected threat of tears that prickle in the corners of her eyes, though she knows they’re not from sadness. Wanda, gracefully, notices.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Boys, why don’t you clear the table and then you can bring out those brownies?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy and Tommy spring into action, stacking plates and cutlery into their arms and ferrying them off to the kitchen. Wanda had been right, they’d devoured most of the spread.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it’s the wine that she’s now had two glasses of or maybe it’s the softness that overtakes her around the kids still lingering, but Agatha finds that she’s grateful for Wanda. The admission remains internal, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two of them were 'mom friends' in the way that dipped just below the surface before, sure, but it’s as if Nicky’s death has– albeit belatedly– brought them closer instead of severing the tie. Wanda’s outright refusal to leave her in her house to rot when almost everyone else had given up is…nice. The connection doesn’t feel forced either, not even when Agatha agrees to hang out only after direct threat of bodily harm or emotional warfare (she hasn’t forgotten about the thing with the scouts).
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy and Tommy bring the brownies back out, breaking her reverie. As soon as they hit the table all four Maximoffs pounce, the adults making no attempt to hide their excitement. Vision, teeth full of chocolate, slides his eyes over to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now I know you don’t like to tell people, but–” Agatha cuts him off with a raised hand and an unimpressed look.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re not getting the recipe Vision. Do not try that shit with me. You know better.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Vision looks appropriately chastised, and he poutingly reaches for another brownie as if to console himself. Around a mouthful of chocolatey goo, Billy addresses her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ms. Agatha, do you remember when we had a sleepover for Nicky’s eighth birthday and you made your brownies for us? We snuck into the kitchen after you and Ms. Rio went to sleep and ate the whole tray.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tommy nods in confirmation. “It was awesome. But then we got
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     sick.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Worth it,” they say at the same time, not even looking at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckles along with everyone else, finding that the memory doesn’t hurt like she would think. Instead it brings only fondness and the secondary memory of waking up to the empty tray and knowing exactly what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she walks home later, having refused to take the half-full tupperware back with her despite Wanda’s insistence, the quiet of a suburban night has fallen. The streetlights are on, fireflies play in the shrubbery of the lawns she passes, and frogs call to one another in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe, she considers, not everything has to go back to how it was. Maybe a few small changes wouldn’t be so bad.

   <div>
    <p>
     July in Massachusetts is shaping up to be sweltering, and the heat has performed the minor miracle of melting away the uncomfortable remnants of her deposition prep and the support group meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the space that the discomfort was filling finally free, Agatha finds herself being subjected to a new form of torture– a deep, pervasive horniness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before, she’d been fine in the gaps between trysts with Rio, almost entirely oblivious to any desires, physical or otherwise, until that knock came to her door. Now it’s as though her body is slowly waking up again after a long winter, and all of the eating and going outside and speaking to other people is reminding her mortal shell of its humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Handling it herself is off the table, though. After last time her brain can’t be trusted not to send her into a post-orgasm tailspin. But things with Rio have gotten far too convoluted, seeping out beyond their once-clear boundaries and bleeding into areas of her life where they don’t belong.
    </p>
    <p>
     A new plan is in order. A Rio-free plan. Agatha stands before the full length mirror in her bedroom while deciding as much, adjusting the hem of the shimmering purple dress that stops only a handful of inches below the curve of her ass and shifting side to side in her black open-toed heels. The garment has been lingering in the back of her closet, the tags still attached when she pulled it out. What its intended purpose was she can’t be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’ll be easy– she’ll go to a bar, find a woman, and have sex with said woman. It’s a Friday night and Agatha knows she’ll turn heads with this outfit. It doesn’t matter that she hasn’t had sex with anyone but Rio in more or less 20 years, because tonight isn’t about her anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s about getting in a no-strings fuck to sooth the itch and then never think about it again. The perfect solution to draw her thoughts away from the circus of the past few months.
    </p>
    <p>
     She calls a car to the bar, not wanting to deal with the hassle of thinking about what to do with her car later. Her driver tries for small talk but quickly gives up when Agatha stonewalls him. She offers a tip when he pulls into the parking lot, not looking back when he calls out a goodnight before entering the building.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slips into a stool at the furthest corner of the bar and sets her black clutch on the wood, giving her a perfect view of the place. It’s all dim lighting and fake leather booths and stools with garish neon lights interspersed along the walls. A cluster of pool tables populate the back wall and the music choice seems to be a cross between early 2000’s rock and current pop hits that she doesn’t know.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are a healthy amount of people both wedged onto seats and swaying on the dance floor, but the place is nowhere near packed. To be fair, it’s only 9 pm, but there was no way in hell that Agatha was going to start her night much later.
    </p>
    <p>
     She catches the bartender’s attention and orders a glass of wine before taking another scan of the room– there’s a group of women crowded at the other end of the bar having what she assumes must be a girls night, and the large corner booth on the other side of the bar is overfilled with people in suits. Agatha suppresses a gag. No tolerable conquests to be found in an office TGIF group.
    </p>
    <p>
     A bunch of rowdy men swarm the pool tables, clutching beer bottles and jeering at one another, and the bar’s patrons are otherwise stragglers or small groups of friends. Agatha’s sure she’s spotted at least two or three that she could pick off easily, mentally preparing to make her move once she’s had a bit more of her wine.
    </p>
    <p>
     From the direction of the bathrooms behind her, a body jostles into her shoulder. Agatha jumps slightly in her skin at the sudden force, her surprise morphing swiftly to anger. There are all of eight fucking people at this bar, and of course some jackass is breathing down her throat–
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh
     </em>
     . Jasmine. Clean soap. Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s whole body tenses and she fights the urge to turn to look at her, wondering if maybe they don’t make eye contact then this will all just be a mirage and she can carry on with her night. Equally strong is the urge to scream and throw herself from the nearest roof. She fights that one too.
    </p>
    <p>
     The decision is made for her when Rio steps just far enough away to slide into a stool of her own, leaving an empty one safely between them that she rests her feet on the rungs of. Rio props her elbow onto the bartop, settling her chin in her hand and turning glassy eyes to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     The dark locks around her face and ears have long since fallen from her claw clip and her red tie hangs untied around her neck. Her white collared shirt wrinkled from the day’s work and her sleeves are pushed up past her elbows, the edge of her black lace bra is just barely visible with the number of buttons she’s undone. Agatha very purposefully does not look.
    </p>
    <p>
     She must be here with the suits, then. Part of the TGIF crowd blowing off steam after a long week.Agatha can tell by her eyes that she’s been here a while and has had a few drinks. Surely the alcohol should knock her somewhat off of her game, but Agatha knows better.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio is looking at her like a snake watching a mouse get dropped into its enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wishes she could run, could flee this bar and this town and this life. But she knows the game is afoot now, and walking away has never been an option. She thinks of the lawsuit and the apology sex in May and having to go to the support group alone, gathering her anger and honing it into a knife
    </p>
    <p>
     “You look nice.” Rio’s opener is weak, so much so that Agatha wonders if there’s some new tactic she’s missing here.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha knows that she
     <em>
      has
     </em>
     been eating more and going outside and even took the bathroom scissors to her split ends– knows she looks more like a woman and less like a ghost these days with her recently regained curves on full display in her barely-there dress.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that’s not what this is about. She ignores the sentiment steadfastly and offers her first counter.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is this your thing now? Getting shitfaced with the people you have to pay to be around you?” Agatha jabs, aiming for destabilization. If anything, though, Rio’s predatory grin only widens, the red of her lipstick framing her white teeth in a bloody hue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s Peggy’s birthday,” Rio explains, her sweet voice so sincere it would fool a lesser woman. “The guys and I thought it would be nice to do a little something for her, since she’s done such a good job.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio waits a beat, watches Agatha’s eyes shutter almost imperceptibly and knows she’s thinking about the coffee shop in February. How vulnerable she’d been.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Most of the group has cleared out, but some of us have been playing drinking games.” Rio points to a stupidly large man with dirty blonde hair, leaning against the full booth and staring down at Peggy, dressed in yet another skirt suit. “That’s her husband, Steve.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha swirls her wine around in her glass, a portrait of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is the part where you share why you’re here, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha downs the rest of her wine, calling for the bartender to bring her a whiskey sour. Something that might dull the roar of her blood in her ears a bit better. To her right, Rio laughs at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Six months ago, Agatha would have told her exactly why she’d come here. Would have phrased it in the way she knew would draw the most blood and would have watched the crimson liquid spill from Rio’s veins with glee.
    </p>
    <p>
     But six months ago, Agatha never would have been in this bar. And now that she’s just finally escaped the weird head space from the past month it feels wrong to say she’s hunting down a one night stand, something about it registering as a line she’s not ready to cross yet. She still has hopes of escaping this bar unscathed, of ending her night without bloodshed.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Agatha lies.
    </p>
    <p>
     She takes a sip of the cocktail the bartender deposits in front of her, relieved to find it’s mostly liquor. “I’m waiting for Wanda.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda? You’re joking.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes dart over to the group of women she’d seen earlier and back to Rio, her resolve hardening.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, Wanda and no I’m not joking. This may come as a shock to you, but I have friends. And it’s girls night.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilts her head, searching Agatha’s face for a moment before dropping her hand away from her chin and calling the bartender to bring her a beer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, sure. You’re here waiting to have girls night with Wanda. I’ll wait with you,” she tosses her gaze from the bartender to Agatha, hoping to catch a glimpse of panic.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha doesn’t give it. If anything, she settles in. She’ll find a way out of this, surely. She just has to think of something.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s drink is going quickly while they sit in silence. She starts to wonder if maybe Rio doesn’t know how to talk to her anymore. Wonders if maybe she’ll realize as much and feel awkward enough to walk away.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought twinges something in Agatha’s chest and she instinctively lifts a hand to rub it away. Rio’s eyes track the motion and she sits up straighter.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice said you went to the support group a few weeks ago,” Rio prompts, suddenly casual. Agatha lifts her lip in the ghost of annoyance, the alcohol finally starting to take hold in her bloodstream.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah. She sent me the link weeks before you did, you know. You didn’t have to be a freak and go into my phone.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio barks a laugh, light and surprised. Maybe shocked to have been caught.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the actual fuck are you talking about?” The words are harsh but mirth is still dancing in her eyes. Agatha’s brows pinch together.
    </p>
    <p>
     “In May, when you came to the house. You disappeared and I’ve had you blocked for years but then you texted and–” Rio’s scoff is so loud it cuts her off. Agatha stabs her tongue into her cheek, debating the merits of throwing her drink in Rio’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s– I don’t even know your password, Agatha. I switched to an iPhone like a year ago. You still have my number blocked– which, fuck you, by the way– so I iMessaged you. It comes through the same way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha feels a balloon begin to inflate in her chest, crowding her organs. Her fingers tighten around her glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But your name was on it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nods slowly, like Agatha is so stupid that it might qualify as a medical anomaly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. That’s how an Apple ID works.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But the picture was the same?” Her voice is less an accusation now, more grasping for straws.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s cheeks darken and she looks down, picking at the label on her beer bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah. I like that picture.” She shrugs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha remembers when she’d seen the photo on her phone screen again and recalled the feeling of being so in love that a half-blurry photo of someone rivals the Mona Lisa in your mind’s eye. She thinks it must be the same the other way around, then. When you’re so loved that you start to see yourself as a work of art too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Old habits die loud and slow and violent and then turn into ghosts that will never leave you alone, or whatever they say.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looks away, picking up her glass to suck an ice cube onto her tongue, letting it turn the muscle numb as it melts and giving her slightly lagging brain a moment to think.
    </p>
    <p>
     She remembers the anger she’d felt at what she thought Rio had done, the feeling of something cold and slimy taking hold in her chest and staying there. She considers the possibility that, maybe, she’s been assuming the worst and Rio is still just Rio, not some cruel stranger wearing her skin. Even if the sex had been some fucked up apology, it hadn’t been a vindictive scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she’s gotten far better at pretending all of the good parts never happened than she ever thought she would– so much so that the lines of reality have gotten skewed along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
     The balloon in her chest pops, taking all of the rage she's holding in her fists with it. She feels adrift without the baseline of a brawl to fall back on. Swallowing the remnants of ice on her tongue, Agatha turns back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay. Talk about something else.” Equal parts command and invitation. Not an apology but not a rejection, either. Rio nods, her blush gone and her face smoothed into something amicable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I did my deposition prep with Stephen on Monday. Sounds like it’s going to be pretty brutal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shakes her head so violently she suspects she may get whiplash before taking a large gulp and finishing her drink, signaling to the bartender for another.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio holds up her hands in surrender before dropping them back to the bartop, leaning in and engulfing the safety that the stool between them had provided.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, Agatha. You wanna talk about why you’re wearing this slutty little ‘fuck me’ dress to, allegedly, get drinks with Wanda?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sucks in a breath through her teeth, unable to fight the flush that rises to her cheeks and trails down her chest. The switch is so sudden that she almost loses her footing, but Agatha's better than that. She pivots, familiar with the cadence of their game even as her brain starts to get fuzzy and her body temperature starts to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you insinuating, Rio?” She asks, imbuing her voice with a veneer of false innocence. Rio doesn’t miss a beat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That from here, it looks like you’re sitting here alone in this bar on a Friday night with that desperate look in your eyes like you need to be bent over. You might as well be begging for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s voice is low now, and every word goes straight to Agatha’s cunt. In return she drops her voice, leaning in so that her breath ghosts over the shell of Rio’s ear when she talks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I’m not alone, am I? I’m with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulls back in time to watch Rio’s darkened eyes flicker down to her lips and back, her tongue subconsciously darting out to wet her own. Agatha needs that tongue elsewhere immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Rio can open her mouth to respond, an obnoxious voice rings through the air, somehow audible even over the shitty music.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Vidal, get over here! You’ve got the company card and we’re out of tequila!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha knows it’s Tony, Rio’s second in command. His father had practically been the king of their shareholders, enabling him to get more or less whatever he wanted. She watches the muscle in Rio’s jaw twitch, watches her take one last look at the expanse of leg left exposed in this dress.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait here,” she says, plucking her beer from the bar and walking back to the booth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watches her go, astounded and appalled by the audacity. She had hardly been able to stomach the fact that Rio was here, let alone been willing to talk. There’s no way in hell that she’s going to
     <em>
      wait here.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She takes another gulp of her already half empty drink, reaching for her clutch and readying to stand when she registers someone new walking over and perching on the stool that Rio had just left. Agatha pauses.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman is wearing a leather jacket and a confident smirk that says she’s used to getting what she wants. Her dark hair falls in thick curls, the ends dyed a deep, vibrant pink. Her focus is entirely on Agatha, giving her a slow once over.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There’s no way that dipshit in the suit just walked away from the most beautiful woman in this bar,” she says with mock indignation, batting her eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s flirting, obviously, and laying it on so thick that Agatha wonders if she’s somehow underestimated her own attractiveness. Agatha tilts her head, looking the woman over from head to toe.
    </p>
    <p>
     She
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     beautiful. It’s undeniable. Agatha’s already miserably wet from her conversation with Rio and this is what she came here for anyway, right? This is what she wanted?
     <em>
      It is.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gets in character and tosses her hair over shoulder with a wink before putting on her best pout.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re telling me, sweetheart. I guess I’ll just have to go home all by myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman’s smirk deepens impossibly. She reaches out, tucking a rogue lock of Agatha’s hair behind her ear and trailing her touch along the line of her jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well we can’t have that, can we?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha knows she has this woman hooked with her minimalistic performance. Even so, something about it lands wrong, twisting the tension in her gut away from desire and closer to nausea. Before she can pin the senasation down the woman’s expression shifts, her fingers pulling away from Agatha’s face with an unexpected quickness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tries not to visibly sag with drunken relief when a strong palm wraps around her hip from behind like a brand, tugging her off of the barstool. She chooses not to read into that feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’ll back the fuck up if you know what’s good for you,” Rio’s voice growls from somewhere behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha feels floaty, light and uninhibited but present enough to wonder if she’s dripping down her thighs. She resists the urge to check for a puddle left in her wake on the cheap pleather barstool. Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman rolls her eyes but leaves, muttering something about freaky territorial dykes in this town.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha barely notices Rio putting cash down on the bar for their drinks and pulling her outside and into a waiting Uber. She follows Rio into the backseat, dutifully buckling herself in and double checking that her clutch made it out with her. When everything is accounted for and the car starts to move, Agatha takes a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s certainly drunk now, the part of her that wants to panic growing quieter and quieter, dwarfed by the enormity of her desire. Her pulse pounds in her core, and she crosses her legs tightly despite knowing it’ll only make her dress ride up further.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly, she inches her hand across the middle seat until her nails find the fabric of Rio’s pants over her thigh. Agatha doesn’t turn her head, keeping her eyes on the passing scenery through the window as she begins to drag her fingertips from Rio’s knee to the top of her thigh and back down.
    </p>
    <p>
     With each pass she creeps slightly inward, keeping her touch just shy of obscene. Rio’s breathing is harsh and loud, like she’s just run a marathon.
    </p>
    <p>
     She readjusts her hand back to the center of Rio’s knee, repeating the cycle until finally the car slows to a stop at the edge of Agatha’s front lawn. Rio undoes both of their seatbelts and all but pushes Agatha out of the car, throwing a strained goodnight to their driver before following Agatha up to the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s movements are swift despite her inebriation, pulling the key from her clutch and getting them into the house in record time. As soon as she’s over the threshold her bag is pulled from her hand and her body is pushed into the cold wood of the front door, her head knocking slightly against the frosted glass pane.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s lips are on her in an instant and she can’t catch the deep, unrestrained moan that tears from her throat before it leaves her. Her body is a livewire beneath Rio’s touch, sparks firing off wherever her hands roam. They fist in her hair before sliding down her back and over her hips, peeling the shiny fabric of her dress up until it’s bunched just below her navel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s so lost in the clash of their mouths that she hardly registers the change, sucking Rio’s tongue into her mouth like she’ll die if she doesn’t. Her eyes shoot open in confusion when Rio pulls away, but Agatha watches as her gaze trails downward and a rumbling groan leaves Rio’s throat at what she finds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even in the dim lamplight of the foyer, Rio can see how wet Agatha is. Her once-red thong is now soaked a dark maroon nearly to the waistband and her pale thighs shine with evidence of her arousal. Agatha resists the urge to squeeze her thighs together at the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s fingers on her hips tighten, hopefully leaving bruises in their wake. She looks back up to Agatha’s face, her own eyes nearly black with lust.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I need to be inside of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha feels liquid heat pour down her spine and nods vigorously, pushing away from the door to tug Rio up to the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they finally make it up, Rio beelines straight for the nightstand on what was once her side of the bed, unbuttoning her shirt and tugging her slacks off on the way over. Agatha pauses to grip the door handle and take off her heels, tossing them by the dresser.
    </p>
    <p>
     She watches with rapt attention as Rio opens the bottom drawer of her nightstand and pulls out her strap and harness. Agatha doesn’t try to hide the fact that she’s vibrating out of her skin, all of the lust she’s spent the past month beating back finally boiling down to this moment. She tugs off her own dress and steps out of it before crossing the room to where Rio is, left in nothing but her ruined thong.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio is finishing the process of tightening the leather harness around her hips and securing the green appendage in the O-ring, her calm exterior betrayed by her blown out pupils and her shaky breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha reaches out and pulls Rio in with a hand at the back of her neck, engaging her in a kiss that’s instantly deep and filthy. She slides her tongue behind Rio’s teeth and licks along the roof of her mouth, splitting her focus long enough to reach around and unclip Rio’s bra. When the straps fall from her shoulders Agatha pulls the garment free, tossing it blindly behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bites Agatha’s bottom lip and pulls, flicking her tongue over the hostage flesh. Agatha moans into the feeling. She steps back when Rio releases her, pushing down on her shoulders until she takes the hint and drops to the edge of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     She spreads her legs lazily, leaning back on her hands to look up at Agatha with a cocky grin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You could have just called if you needed my dick this badly, you know,” she drawls. Agatha knows that she’s trying for cocky. Knows this, but can’t unhear the obvious note of genuine insecurity in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ignores it, giving her no verbal response and sinking to her knees on the plush rug so that she’s nestled between Rio’s open thighs. She reaches out, wrapping a hand sensually around the base of Rio’s cock and letting the other settle on Rio’s thigh to steady herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha flits her eyes up, blue locking onto brown from beneath her lashes as she purses her lips and lets a wad of spit drop onto the tip and roll down the shaft.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Rio’s hands flies into Agatha’s hair like it belong there (it does) and her exhaled breath is a hissed
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pumps the hand wrapped around the shaft a few times, spreading her spit over the appendage, before leaning down and flicking her tongue over the tip without breaking eye contact. She watches as Rio’s eyes roll back in her head and feels the fingers in her hair give a sharp tug.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stays that way for a moment, running the tip of her tongue lightly along the underside of the shaft and parting her lips just enough to wrap around the head. She moans around the silicon and applies more pressure with her hand, her voice vibrating the strap at the same time that her hand presses the base into Rio’s clit. Rio’s hips jump, just like she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha begins to work in earnest, taking more of Rio down her throat. She feels Rio’s other hand join the first in her hair, pulling her mane of waves away from her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     She continues to grind the base against Rio’s clit, taking more of her in her mouth with each pass. When her nose finally presses into the skin above Rio's pubic bone, Agatha looks up to find Rio already watching her with drawn brows and her lip held painfully between her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     When their eyes lock Rio gives a small, seemingly involuntary buck of her hips. Agatha gags with the motion, sinking her nails into the meat of Rio’s thigh and moaning loudly. She nods her head as best she can and Rio does it again.
    </p>
    <p>
     And again and again, fucking herself into Agatha’s throat. Agatha can feel the tears slipping from her eyes and down her cheeks but she can’t look away from Rio’s face, too enraptured by the vision of her mounting pleasure. She can almost feel it building in her own body, like if she only focuses hard enough she can slip into Rio’s body, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the liquor and lust working double time in her bloodstream, Agatha can almost pretend that they’re strangers– two people who met tonight at the bar and just happened to have insane sexual chemistry. They can almost be any two bodies coming together in an unspoken dance and not the tired choreography of a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
     They can almost be Agatha and Rio, 25 and stumbling home to fuck like rabbits in their apartment after a night of dancing with their friends, young and beautiful and unshattered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s breath catches on a whimper in the back of her throat and Agatha looks up in time to watch her back arch, her nails digging into Agatha’s scalp like a tether. Rio’s body stays frozen before she breaks, her orgasm rushing through her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hips continue to roll as she works through the aftershocks, pulsing her cock into the back of Agatha’s throat. The whole scene is so unbelievably hot that Agatha shifts her hips, rutting her clothed cunt against the heel of her own foot. The relief is immediate, but it’s nowhere near enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if she can sense it, Rio gingerly pulls Agatha’s head back off of her, leaning down to place a wet kiss against her swollen lips before shuffling back to rest against the headboard, her legs stretched out in front of her and her hands resting on her abs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come up here, pretty girl,” she coos. Agatha pushes up from the floor and climbs onto the bed, crawling to Rio before settling back on her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take these off,” Rio instructs, snapping the waistband of her thong.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha does so, reaching a hand out to hold the headboard and keep from falling. A string of slick stretches between her pussy and the fabric as she pulls it down before it snaps, and Rio releases a desperate, choked moan at the sight like she’s ready to cum again just from seeing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      It wouldn’t be the first time
     </em>
     , Agatha thinks.
    </p>
    <p>
     She throws a leg over Rio’s hips and places one hand at the juncture of her shoulder and throat, using the other to line herself up. Rio’s hands instinctively fall to their place at her hips, rubbing circles into the skin with her thumbs. Agatha wastes no time in lining herself up and sinking down, surprising even herself when Rio meets no resistance and bottoms out.
    </p>
    <p>
     She closes her eyes and lifts her other hand to mirror its twin on Rio’s shoulder, breathing through the stretch and the overwhelming feeling of being so perfectly filled. Rio cranes her head forward, kissing at Agatha’s chest and throat while she adjusts. She runs her tongue over a nipple and Agatha’s back arches into the motion, her hips rolling slightly of their own accord.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if being given permission by her own body, Agatha leans back and starts a slow rhythm. Rio’s hands stay obediently at her hips, but Agatha can see her eyelashes fluttering like it’s taking great effort to keep her hips still.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You thought you were gonna bend me over baby, but you forgot this cock is mine. You want this just as much as I do,” she chastises, watching a blush rise to Rio’s cheeks and feeling her blunt nails press further into her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opens her mouth to respond, but Agatha chooses that moment to lift her hips and slam back down, beginning to ride her in earnest. Whatever retort was coming transforms into a whine, and Agatha can’t help but smirk at the clear win.
    </p>
    <p>
     The victory is short lived, her pleasure winning out over any games she could play. Agatha shifts forward slightly until the head of Rio’s cock drags perfectly against that spot inside of her with every thrust, picking up speed to propel her building orgasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Rio’s hands lifts from her hips to palm her breast, her fingers pinching around the nipple. The moan Agatha releases is profane, joining the slick sounds of the symphony they’re conducting. After a particularly forceful drop down, she lets her sweaty forehead drop down to rest against Rio’s hairline.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re so–
     <em>
      ah–
     </em>
     you’re so deep I can feel you in my fucking throat,” she whines, feeling the coil beginning to tighten inside of her, moments away from snapping.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes flash and her hand lifts from Agatha’s breast to circle her throat, squeezing with her thumb and middle two fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? Here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     All Agatha can do is nod and moan, the floaty feeling in her head sending a pulse to her clit. All of her senses are heightened by the alcohol and how unbelievably turned on she is, and for once Agatha is all of the way out of her head and in her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are no thoughts spared to the implications of all of this, no concerns about how she’ll feel tomorrow that can reach her. There are only Rio’s hand at her throat and Rio’s fingers moving to swipe at her clit and Rio’s cock inside of her. She moves her own hands from Rio’s shoulders to her tits, grabbing roughly as she explodes into her orgasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha feels her cunt squeeze so tightly around Rio that she’s locked inside, the white hot pressure of her orgasm traveling outward and burning up to her ears and down to her toes. It’s perfect, and for a moment she wonders if she’s actually blacked out.
    </p>
    <p>
     But before she can fully regain her senses, Rio flips them, pressing Agatha’s face down into the mattress and pulling her hips into the air without ever disconnecting them.
    </p>
    <p>
     All that Agatha can do is moan at a volume closer to a scream, gripping the sheets below her for dear life. Rio pounds into her, one hand splayed wide on Agatha’s back while the fingers of the other rub messy circles against her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seems like
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     forgot that this pussy is mine, too. So I’m going to use you how I want to and maybe that’ll help jog your memory.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The words alone tip Agatha into another orgasm, sharper but no less strong than the first. She sobs into the sheets beneath her, every nerve ending alight.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio doesn’t stop, fucking her into overstimulation until finally her rhythm falters and she lets her weight fall against Agatha’s back, gasping a moan directly into her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seconds or hours later, Rio pulls slowly out of her and falls limp at Agatha’s side, still breathing heavily. She can hear the soft clink of the harness straps pulling loose, but her heavy eyelids fall shut of their own accord and she’s asleep before any other thoughts can find her.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha wakes, there’s a moment where she can’t place her surroundings or the flood of urgency that begins to fill her. She blinks repeatedly, finding the red glow of her bedside clock and seeing that it reads 4:30, the world still pitch black.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bed is shifting next to her, she realizes, the covers thrashing and frantic breathing reaching her at last. When a frightened whimper hits her ears, her long-dormant maternal instincts come to life and she acts on muscle memory. She reaches out, finding a warm body and dragging it close, shaking it slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” she tries. No response comes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” more urgently, “wake up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes fly open, wide and terrified even in the dark of the moonlit bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s concern is so overwhelming that she doesn’t stop to think about the fact that Rio is still here. That they had the sex that they did and had fallen asleep together after and that Rio is
     <em>
      still here
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes find her face at last and her arms shoot out, clinging to Agatha’s shoulders for dear life. Rio burrows her face into the skin of Agatha's throat. Agatha can feel her hot tears at her clavicle, can feel how every breath she takes is too shallow to be getting any real air to her lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha keeps her hold around Rio, pressing a palm between her shoulder blades and taking deep, slow breaths like she used to when Nicky had meltdowns as a toddler.
    </p>
    <p>
     After several long minutes Rio calms down enough to match her breathing, and Agatha would think she’d fallen asleep if it wasn’t for the occasional sniffle. She can count on one hand the number of times she’s seen Rio like this. it’s unnerving.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s always the same,” Rio whispers into the dark, so quiet that Agatha almost misses it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's Death. It comes for my parents first and then for Nicky, and I can’t make it stop. The more that I scream, the more it laughs. And when I think it’s finally over, it comes for you.” Her voice breaks, and she takes another ragged breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I can’t– I can never make it in time before it drags you into the ground, too. No matter how fast I dig, I can never reach you.” She’s still hiccuping between words, her breath catching on a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re the only person left that I love that isn’t dead.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The hairline fractures between the pieces of Agatha’s paper mache heart tear into gaping fissures. She runs her nails along Rio’s scalp on autopilot, twirling soft hair around her fingers in the way that has always soothed her. She lets the warm tears continue to fall against her chest before finally pulling Rio more tightly against her, ignoring her use of love in the present tense and the serrated dagger that it plunges through her gut.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m right here,” she whispers, because what else is there to say? Her raspy voice catches on the words and she tries again, more firm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m right here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It feels like lying to Rio earlier at the bar, but worse. It feels like a nightmare and a daydream intertwined, the universe itself  feeling unsure if Agatha deserves to be comforted or punished and settling for both.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eventually, Rio’s breathing evens out once more, her tears drying into Agatha’s skin. They fall back asleep that way– Rio’s full weight on her chest, curled in like she’s trying to crawl behind Agatha’s ribs even in her sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha wakes again to full sunlight, her first thought is that she didn’t have a single dream, bad or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second is that she’s alone in the bed, with her t-shirt drawer slightly ajar and the harness and strap discarded on the floor. So much for pretending to be strangers, or whatever
     <em>
      just two bodies
     </em>
     bullshit she was drunkenly peddling herself. She should know better than to think that the cold, unforgiving jaws of reality would leave her alone for even a single night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sets her hand on the pillow next to her, cool to the touch. The bile that rises to her throat tastes like whiskey and regret.
    </p>
    <p>
     This feels far worse than a one night stand would have, she decides.

   <div>
    <p>
     After two full days of silence and isolation, Agatha succumbs to the simple truth that if she spends one more moment alone with her racing thoughts she’ll crack clean in half.
    </p>
    <p>
     Since she woke up to an empty bed on Saturday, shame, guilt, rage, and regret have beaten incessantly against the walls of her skull like a drum. Longing, sharp and loud like a long-festering hunger, tried to muscle its way in every now and again. Agatha swallowed it forcefully back down each time, clenching her teeth lest it crawl up her throat again.
    </p>
    <p>
     When her salvation comes at last, it is not without stipulations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha parks her car at the neighborhood pool, sparing a fleeting thought to her sanity and adjusting her sunglasses in the rearview mirror. Wanda had sent her a text suggesting she’d benefit from an extra set of eyes on the twins at the pool since Vision had to work, and Agatha had been ready to do just about anything that would give her an out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Never mind that going to the pool meant setting herself directly in the sights of everyone she’s been actively avoiding for three years. Agatha’s not above calling in a bomb threat if Ralph Boner takes it upon himself to make small talk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite shelling out a small fortune for her HOA fees each year, she hasn’t been here in a long time, annoyed at the mere thought of the screaming kids and the chemical smell and the blistering heat of the sun. Nonetheless, she grabs her pool bag from the passenger seat and adjusts the knot of her purple sarong around her waist before stepping out of the vehicle and walking up to the pool gate.
    </p>
    <p>
     The place isn’t as crowded as she had feared, only a handful of families milling about the tables and loungers. The teenage lifeguard perched on the other end of the concrete doesn’t even look up when the gate clangs shut behind her, sweeping his gaze lazily over the water instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha catches movement out of the corner of her eye and turns, finding Wanda waving at her from a set of loungers tucked mostly beneath the shade of the pool house awning. She forgoes a return wave but crosses over to join her all the same, setting her bag down and pulling out a towel to drape over the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks for leaving your lair to join us. It makes me nervous when they outnumber me,” Wanda greets, tucking a finger into the book in her hands to mark her page.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha only grunts in acknowledgement, dropping her sarong and settling onto her lounger. She pulls at the top of her black one piece bathing suit, adjusting the strapless garment so that it covers more of her chest. Family friendly environment and all that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda seems to accept her silence, looking out to where the twins are playing in the shallow end with a few other boys and watching them for a moment. When she’s content with their safety, Wanda lays back down, her scarlet hair fanning around her head and her face scrunching in concentration as she lifts the novel in her hand and resumes her reading.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shifts on her lounger, thankful that the majority of her body is under the shade. Despite her hangover being long gone, she still feels like she got hit by a truck. Her muscles are sore and her gut twists with turmoil-induced nausea. Her mind keeps drifting back to Friday night, regret curling in her chest that it happened at all and a film of guilt for feeling that way settling over it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha can feel when Wanda’s focus slides to her, her eyes tracking Agatha’s unease. Before she can say anything, a shadow falls across Agatha’s sun-exposed legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well aren’t you just a sight for sore eyes!” Sharon’s squeaky, overeager voice reaches her ears. Agatha feels her left eye twitch in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hello, Sharon.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Sharon hovers near her feet with the largest sunhat in the history of man, the ribbon around its brim matching the gaudy pink of her floral tankini and swim skirt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I feel like we haven’t seen you in forever! It’s so nice that you’re getting out and about again. You know, they say sunshine and fresh air can really cure just about anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pushes down the groan that she feels building in her throat. A glance to her side shows Wanda biting back a grin, the corners of her mouth curling upward.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What have you been up to, dear? What’s got you so busy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ritual sacrifices and acts of vigilante justice,” Agatha deadpans while holding Sharon’s eyes, hoping to end this conversation. Sharon merely throws her head back in exaggerated laughter, placing one hand on her hip and wagging a finger at Agatha with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’ve always been such a funny one. You really need to get back to book club, it certainly hasn’t been the same without you.” She turns. “And you too, Wanda. The girls have been asking about you!” She admonishes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The girls in question being, of course, Sharon’s group of wine-addled friends in their 60’s that have always cooed at Agatha and Wanda like they were teenagers and not women in their mid to late 30’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wish I could, Sharon, but I’m afraid I don’t know how to read,” Agatha tries again, starting to wonder if this conversation would also be a good enough reason to make her bomb threat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sharon turns her focus back to Agatha, a warm smile on her lips and glee in her eyes. “You really are a hoot, Agatha.” Sharon bends slightly, placing an awkward pat on Agatha’s shin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll leave you girls to it, but remember that we’re all here for you if you need us! The neighborhood sticks together,” Sharon chimes as she pulls away, her eyes wide and her face serious.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      ‘Here if you need us’ my ass
     </em>
     Agatha thinks, gritting her teeth as Sharon trots away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence falls between them again, but Agatha can feel Wanda’s eyes back on the side of her face. She feels the desperate need to unzip her skin to make room for the additional emotions that Sharon has left in her wake, longing for the time when all of it could be condensed into a single-minded anger.
    </p>
    <p>
     She waits for the sensation to pass, for her composure to return, but it seems unwilling to come.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda waits too, patient and serene. Distantly, Agatha hears the splashes and squeals of a cannonball competition. So much for pushing all of it down and hoping it goes away on its own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Quietly, without removing her sunglasses or meeting Wanda’s eyes, Agatha starts with the explanation that feels most apt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I slept with Rio,” she murmurs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You never stopped sleeping with Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha jerks her head to the side at the words. She must make some sound of surprise, because Wanda honest to god giggles.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ve seen her car in the driveway and then you randomly have these big ass hickies like you got into a fight with a vampire. I’m sorry to say you haven’t been very subtle.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The shock of being called out so bluntly dulls some of the churning in her gut.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ok. Sure, we sleep together from time to time. But this was.. different, I guess.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Different how?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Like it wasn’t supposed to happen. I was horny, I went out to find someone to fuck, and she was there too. It was just sort of a drunken thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost as an afterthought, Agatha adds, “and then she stayed over.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Does she not usually stay over?” Wanda lifts an eyebrow, like this is the only piece of information to have surprised her thus far. Agatha gives a dismissive shake of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, that’s not how this goes. We fight, we fuck, she goes home. It’s straightforward. This was, I don’t know, more intimate? And then she was gone in the morning. I obviously haven’t heard from her but things feel weirder, somehow.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha doesn’t want to bring up Rio’s nightmare or the moment they’d had. She won’t share that Rio said she loves her, already pushing that little tidbit somewhere inside of her that the light can’t reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda skips over the new and horrific discovery about the way they’ve been interacting since their separation, only having speculated before, and instead continues determinedly on her path.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you want her to still be there in the morning?”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Yes. No.
     </em>
     Agatha deflects.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I knew exactly what to expect when things were how they used to be. I feel like I have no control over anything anymore. This whole thing feels like a big
     <em>
      fuck you
     </em>
     from the universe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her throat tightens with frustration, both with the situation and with Wanda’s pestering. Whether or not she wanted Rio to stay isn’t the point– the point is that she needs to figure out how to get back to safer, more detached territory. How to undo Friday night. Wanda, clearly coming to a different conclusion, rolls her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nobody can control every aspect of their life, Agatha. Sometimes we just have to roll with the punches.” She meets Agatha’s eyes, lifting her brows as if to convey that she’s being serious. “The both of you need to get it together and have a real conversation.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wants to snap back at Wanda for being preachy, but her attention snags.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The both of us?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s eyes slowly latch back onto her book, her limbs tensing with awkwardness even as she feigns nonchalance.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, yeah. I see Rio pretty often in the warmer months. The boys are student volunteers in the memorial garden,” she explains, pretending to read the pages before her and studiously ignoring Agatha’s burning stare.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course she knows about the memorial garden. Rio had funded its inception at the elementary school the spring after Nicky’s death, planting flowers and trees and shrubs and working with the kids and teachers to maintain them every year since.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had been only once, slipping through the small wooden gate that bore a hand painted sign reading
     <em>
      Nicky’s Garden.
     </em>
     She walked along the colorful tile path and ran her fingers over sleek leaves, pausing to sit on a bench surrounded by saplings that will one day be voluminous willows. It was breathtaking, and Agatha could feel herself siphoning the life out of it with every step. She’s never gone back.
    </p>
    <p>
     The feeling of betrayal that colors her reception of Wanda’s admission is bitter on her tongue, mostly because Agatha doesn’t want to feel it. It’s an old feeling, rooted somewhere inside of her where the spoiled parts go to rot, not be dragged back up.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s not that she owns Wanda, and it’s not that she really
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     her neighbors to have rallied around her like Sharon suggested. It was that they had rallied around Rio. That of all the people Wanda could be spending her time with it has to be Agatha’s ex-wife.
    </p>
    <p>
     In her mind’s eye, Agatha imagines the two of them laughing between rows of sunflowers, sharing in some joke that she’ll never be privy to. Agatha takes the image and superimposes it over Rio’s reaction Friday night when she had said she was waiting for Wanda at the bar, and the feeling of exclusion doubles.
    </p>
    <p>
     She breathes through her nose, looking out at the gaggle of children splashing in the water while she gathers her thoughts. Agatha tries– she really does– to take a second and remember how she’d felt when she found out Rio hadn’t actually fucked with her phone. Tries to remember that Rio is clever and she can be cruel, but that she isn’t vindictive. Tries to picture her as a human and not a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
     What surfaces instead is the awkward strain that had inundated their attempt at conversation, that unexpected gap of silence. That, and the way she had cracked Agatha open in the night only to slip out before dawn, leaving Agatha to flounder while she gets to return to business as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two swirl together, forming into a single thought: she and Rio are nowhere near on the same page anymore. They haven’t been in a long time, and she’d do well to remember that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moves her focus back to Wanda, who still hasn’t turned the page of her book. The same old feeling lingers, taking up more space rather than disappearing after her attempts to rationalize it away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly it’s three years ago again and Agatha is stuck in the knowledge that everyone around her knows how to handle themselves and their emotions normally, and she’s still the pity project that they’re dragging along out of some twisted sense of obligation.
    </p>
    <p>
     How quickly she had gone from being Agatha Harkness-Vidal to simply Rio’s Mad Wife– one of them a grieving mother and the other a monster haunting her steps.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, one thing’s for damn sure. She won’t spend the day letting Wanda treat her like some small, broken thing as a tribute to her friendship to Rio. Agatha gathers her bag and stands, whisking her towel off of the lounger.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wish I could say this was nice, Red, but I have to head out. Work thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda sits up, setting her book face down on her lounger and looking up with regret-filled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha wait–”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sure I’ll see you around, what with you being in my fucking business and all. Don’t let your kids drown.”
    </p>
    <p>
     With that Agatha turns on her heel and leaves, making the quick drive back to the house and hurrying to get inside. Her prison walls, so safe. So familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
     She inhales deeply, feels the chill of the air conditioning press against her sweat damp and sunscreen sticky skin before walking through the house to hang her towel out on the back deck. Comfortable once more in the familiar ache of her solitude, she meanders to the kitchen and begins to assemble a peanut butter sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha falters for a moment with the knife in her hand and the bread in the toaster, realizing the motion is more a habit than a true craving. Every pool day has come with a round of peanut butter sandwiches, usually held in still soggy hands and devoured by giggling mouths on the front porch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her phone begins to buzz where she left it on the counter and Agatha drifts across the kitchen, lifting it to her ear without looking and expecting the mechanical voice of a spam call.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ms. Harkness, hello, it’s Stephen Strange.”
    </p>
    <p>
     His voice is pitched strangely high, and she can almost imagine him tugging at the collar of his shirt. Of course, it’s fucking Stephen calling about the lawsuit. Because all of the walls have to be closing in on her at once. Nothing about this life can ever just be awful in half measures.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stephen. To what do I owe the pleasure?” She makes no effort to hide the agitation in her words. Stephen seems too wound up to notice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you and Rio never actually get divorced?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitates, the question catching her off guard.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, legally, no. That’s a lot of money, Stephen,” she chastises mockingly. Over the line she can hear his incredulous laugh, followed by a whispered
     <em>
      oh my god
     </em>
     and the rapid clicking of fingers on a keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” his voice is strained, like it’s physically paining him not to scream at her, “the whole point of you and Rio’s involvement in the case is to help show the damage that the clinic has done to fam– people’s lives! I’ve been using your divorce in our opening argument, we didn’t even begin to cover this in your deposition prep–”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Actually, Stephen,” she cuts him off, unimpressed and exhausted, “we’re part of the lawsuit because our son is dead. And if memory serves me– and it does–
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     told us that it was fine if our story was shaky because we’re not part of your primary argument anyway. Sounds like you’re the one who made an oopsie.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Across the line, Stephen makes a mangled sort of sound. Agatha ignores him. She registers the
     <em>
      ding!
     </em>
     of her toast popping up behind her and makes a play to wrap this conversation up before it grows cold.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re a smart boy, I’m sure you can find a way to work around this. Think of it as a fun little challenge.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He sighs, forlorn. “Why couldn’t you just make it official on paper? You two hate each other anyway.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Stephen inhales an obnoxious breath like he can suck the words back in, the noise crackling over the line and scratching sharply against Agatha’s eardrum. The silence that follows is oppressive.
    </p>
    <p>
     Holding her cracked phone to her ear in her sun drenched kitchen, still in her bathing suit and with a butter knife clutched in her free hand, Agatha wonders how she can explain to this man the way that separating from the love of one’s life is painful enough without adding extra steps.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she should tell him that when the front door slammed shut behind Rio and Agatha knew that she wasn’t coming back, it was more damning than any fucking government document could ever be. Or that it doesn’t matter if they’re legally bound or not because their souls were knotted together on the day that they met and they’ll stay that way until the day that they die.
    </p>
    <p>
     She opens her mouth, ready to tell him that he’s more than welcome to cleave her in two and root around to sort out the parts that want to hate Rio from the parts that want to hold her, though she’s certain he’ll find that they’ve blended together to form an indistinguishable slop trying to pass itself off as a whole woman. Ready to say that maybe it looks like hate to him right now but all of this was love, once.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shuts her mouth again, suddenly very aware that she doesn’t want to say anything even remotely close to that to Stephen Strange. To herself, either. She hangs up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Assembling her sandwich and eating at the counter in silence, Agatha reaches back in her mind for that old feeling of numbness she used to be able to call forth at will. She tries, fruitlessly, to pluck herself free from this body and this life and float along with the other dust moats in the shaft of sunlight hitting her tile floors. Reminds herself that all of this will end some day only to find that it doesn’t sooth her like it used to.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the sandwich is gone and she sweeps the crumbs into the trash, Agatha decides to approach things from a different angle. She throws on shorts and a tank top, grabbing a book from her nightstand that she’s been trying to make herself read and getting back into her car.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nobody else is at the cemetery when she arrives, which doesn’t come as a surprise. It’s a sweltering Monday afternoon, not quite prime ‘visiting the dead’ hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hi baby.” She presses her palm flat to the ground by his headstone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha takes up residence in the grass by the foot of Nicky’s grave, sitting perpendicular to make the same L shape that they used to on the couch for movie nights or when he would play video games while she worked on her laptop.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s nice even with the heat, the beads of sweat rolling down the notches of her spine not enough to detract from the calm of being with her son in the only way that she can anymore. The book she’s reading isn’t necessarily good, but it’s enough to keep her mind occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
     When a person-shaped shadow falls across her lap and blocks out the sun, Agatha gets a rather unfortunate sense of déjà vu. She looks up, shielding her eyes with her forearm. Above her looms Alice, wearing a tank top and cargo shorts.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stares up at her quizzically instead of responding before looking around, wondering if Stephen put out some sort of hit on her for the whole divorce conversation. Maybe he sent Alice to admonish her on his behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Alice merely shoves her fists into the pockets of her shorts, rocking back on her heels.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn’t mean to interrupt– my mom’s a few rows up and I saw you on my way out. Figured I’d say hi.” She shrugs, inclining her head to the marble slab. “Is this your son?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha is relieved that Alice seems to have no ulterior motive in striking up the conversation, but watching her read his headstone makes Agatha feel suddenly exposed. Her pulse picks up in her chest, but she nods anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, this is Nicky.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice gives a soft smile. “Hey, Nicky. I’m Alice. I know your mom, sort of.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha realizes she’s staring when Alice meets her eyes and forces out an awkward laugh, pulling a hand from her pocket to rub at the back of her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry if that was weird, I always talk out loud to my mom. I like to think that they can hear us, you know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clears her throat, turning to face his headstone if only to break their eye contact. “It wasn’t weird. I do it too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A beat passes. Agatha decides to be gracious and fill the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where’s Jen?”
    </p>
    <p>
     A flicker of something unreadable crosses Alice’s face. “Lorna’s doing this day camp for a few weeks. We were worried about her having an episode while she’s there, so Jen decided to be a volunteer chaperone to be nearby.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The premise of Alice’s statement is somber. Agatha knows this. Still, she snorts an uncontrollable laugh. At Alice’s confused look, she explains through her laughter, “I actually cannot imagine Jen tolerating a child other than her own.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice does smile at that, her amusement tinged with shyness but still full.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Me neither. So far she’s had to come home every day and sit in the bath for an hour in total silence.” Her smile widens. “I think I caught her screaming into the water last night.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughs, loud and real at the image.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just hope she survives it, because there’s no way in hell I’m doing that deposition by myself next week,” Alice says, shaking her head at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     It makes sense that Alice and Jen’s date would be so far before their own, but still. Agatha feels the slightest twinge of stress on Alice’s behalf. They instigated the lawsuit for a reason, she remembers. Alice knows what she’s doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well I better head back to work, I was just popping over on my lunch break,” Alice explains, taking a shuffle step backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was good to see you, Agatha,” she shifts her eyes to Nicky’s headstone and back, that small smile never leaving her face. “He’s lucky to have a mom like you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     With that she offers one last wave and leaves, tracing a path back to her car. Agatha grips the book in her hands tightly, feels the unexpected yet significant rush of tension leaving her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s being recognized as a mother in the present tense, it’s being able to laugh at the absurdity to be found in something difficult, it’s the relief of having a single conversation today that didn’t feel like it was make or break.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s all of it, touching on the same old wound that Wanda unknowingly had at the pool earlier but now with a gentler hand, smoothing the old fracture back over. Agatha returns to her book, feeling lighter than before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Later, when she gets back in the car, Agatha shoots Wanda a text about maybe going for a walk some time soon. It’s not an apology, but Wanda responds with a little red heart all the same.

    <p>
     The following Thursday is eaten up by an hours-long team meeting, wherein Agatha begins to seriously contemplate the merits of figuring out how to fall asleep with her eyes open.
    </p>
    <p>
     Is it really possible that the financial report alone can take an hour and a half? Or that considering a slight change in the HEX codes for their company colors needs to be deliberated so seriously? Agatha thinks the answer to both should be a resounding
     <em>
      no
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     When Lilia lifts her reading glasses from her face and sets them on her desk around 2:30, Agatha is sure her sigh of relief is echoed by every other attendee. Sadly, she’s the only one with her mic on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia shoots a glare in her general direction, though the distance of the video call really takes some of the sting out of the gesture. She turns her focus back to the screen at large and flashes a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you all for your time today, I think we’ve given ourselves a fantastic roadmap for the next few months.” She’s already closing the laptop in front of her, but pauses before dismissing them all.
    </p>
    <p>
     “As I’m sure you’ve all seen in your inbox, I’m having my fiftieth birthday party this weekend,” Lilia plays coy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia has not been 50 in, more or less, 13 years. Agatha considers pointing this out, but decides to leave it be. Let the old bat have her fun.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know we’re all pretty spread out, but you’re all more than invited and if you have the means to make it, I would love to see you there. It’s not going to be anything fancy, just a dinner party here at my house. None of that cake and singing nonsense. Please feel free to bring a plus one!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes are alight, and despite her words Agatha can almost see the Great Gatsby-esque fantasy playing out behind her eyes. Some of her coworkers unmute to confirm that they’ll be there while others share deep, excessive apologies for having to miss the event. Agatha stays silent, already very certain her Saturday night will entail a good cocktail and a true crime documentary consumed on her couch in a cocoon of blankets.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her phone buzzes on her desk, and she’s surprised to see a notification from Lilia.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Lilia:
     </b>
     <em>
      Everyone means you too, Harkness. You’ll be there or I’ll make you start attending meetings in person.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes flash incredulously between her phone and her computer screen where Lilia is bidding them all a good afternoon, tossing Agatha a wink when they’re the last two on the call before leaving. When the actual fuck did she even have time to type that out? Witch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looks like she’s headed to Boston on Saturday.

    <hr/>
    <p>
     Saturday afternoon comes sooner than she’d like, and Agatha stands in her foyer in a black halter neck maxi dress, nice enough that she can’t be accused of being underdressed but comfortable enough that it won’t piss her off as the night wears on.
    </p>
    <p>
     She adjusts her lipstick and runs her fingers through her unruly hair in the mirror above the shoe rack while she waits for her ride. Agatha will go to the party, sure, but she draws the line at driving herself. There’s no chance in hell she’s going to endure this evening sober.
    </p>
    <p>
     A honk sounds from outside and she grabs her keys, pulling the front door open and stepping out. She pauses when her eyes adjust to the light, finding the pastel yellow VW Beetle waiting in her driveway in all of its obnoxious glory. Beggars can’t be choosers, she supposes.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was by sheer luck that she remembered one of her coworkers lives only one town over– Helen or Alena or something– and that said coworker had agreed to pick her up on the way up to Boston. Agatha remembers her as being a young thing, but her ability to do covert opposition research on their clients’ competitors is matched only by her older sister, who Agatha had worked with at
     <em>
      Divination
     </em>
     for a handful of years.
    </p>
    <p>
     She and Natasha hadn’t spoken much, but Agatha had always respected the bone-deep fear that she inspired in men. It had been a bit of a bummer when she’d left to work in actual spy or defense shit or whatever overseas, but she’d recommended Lilia hire her sister in her stead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had spoken to the girl maybe three or four times, but she seemed fine enough. Good enough at her job that Agatha doesn’t really need to think about her much, which is how she likes it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha locks the door behind her and heads out to the car, bracing herself for whatever sort of headache this drive is sure to bring her. But the girl doesn’t make small talk beyond a simple hello once the door shuts behind Agatha, pulling back out of the neighborhood and making for the highway.
    </p>
    <p>
     She does, however, sing loudly and off-key to a god awful playlist with a mix of Chappell Roan, dramatic 80’s ballads, and folk music in a language Agatha couldn’t even begin to guess. Agatha considers opening her door and throwing herself out of the car at about the one hour mark, but ultimately decides it’s not worth it on the off chance she survives.
    </p>
    <p>
     Halfway through the trip she glances to the dash, seeing the bluetooth connection labeled
     <em>
      Yelena’s iPhone
     </em>
     . Okay, so not Helen or Alena. She’d been close, though.
    </p>
    <p>
     When finally Yelena slows the car to a stop just down the street from Lilia’s place, Agatha finds she’s nowhere near as tense as she figured she’d be by now. In fact, she feels a bit giddy when her watch reads 5:00 and she realizes it’s the perfect time to start in on Lilia’s fancy ass liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
     She waits politely for Yelena to join her from the other side of the car so that they can make the short walk together, mentally patting herself on the back for being so gracious.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia’s brownstone is beautiful and every bit as stupidly expensive as it appears from the outside. The crawling ivy up the face of the bricks and the half-drawn curtains in the window are all perfectly arranged to give the illusion of someone who doesn’t care much for decorating, but Agatha knows better.
    </p>
    <p>
     The house rests on a quiet street with similarly ornate and overpriced homes, though still not too far from the heart of the city. Agatha ascends the front steps and reaches for the brass doorknob without knocking, swinging the door open and stepping through like she owns the place. Somewhat sheepishly, Yelena trails in after her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many of the guests have yet to arrive but a healthy amount of people are still milling about Lilia’s home, floating between the dining room, kitchen, and living room. The whole place drips in gem tones and small but impactful details that scream comfort. Her furniture is an eclectic mix of modern and antique, blending together so seamlessly that it all seems like a curated collection when viewed as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha’s been here too many times to be impressed by any of it anymore, instead making a beeline for the expansive drink cart that Lilia keeps in the formal dining room. She plucks a glass from the shelf and scans each of the bottles, wanting to be sure to indulge in only the best of what Lilia has to offer. Agatha didn’t come to Boston to drink the low brow shit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers are halfway to a bottle when she hears a low, amused voice just to her right.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Glad to see you have your priorities straight, Agatha,” the voice drawls.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolls her eyes, knowing who it is before she ever looks. It’s Hela, Divination’s CFO. The deliverer of Thursday’s notoriously unbearable financial report and a somewhat friend of several years. Or an amicable coworker, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha flicks her wrist towards Hela, ready to wave her off while she finishes the very important task of making a drink selection, but catches another figure standing on Hela’s other side.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s wearing a matching brown vest and dress pants, her hands tucked casually into her pockets. A single gold chain hangs around her throat and her hair is down for once, falling in waves across her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you here?” Agatha asks, quick and sharp. She didn’t quite mean to say that out loud, but she does want to know the answer. Rio’s expression hardens instantly, like her anger had just been waiting for Agatha to provoke it. Her hands pull free from her pockets to cross over her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because I was invited, Agatha. In case you forgot, Lilia was the godmother of my child. She gave you away at our wedding–”
    </p>
    <p>
     “As a bit–”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you think she was going to drop me like you did? Did you think just because you tried to cut me out of your life that I stopped existing in everyone else’s?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Clearly, Rio had intended for the words to come across as cutting, sharp in the way that Agatha’s had been. But when they clearly register as sincere, she clenches her jaw, rolling her shoulders back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know what? I’m not doing this with you tonight.” She turns to Hela, acting as though Agatha isn’t there at all. “I’ll find you later.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turns and disappears in the direction of the living room, her body thrumming with a tension that feels palpable to Agatha. She watches her go, stunned into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hela lets out a low whistle, looking to where Rio had disappeared before turning back to Agatha with wide, amused eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yikes! You really know how to woo a woman, Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bares her teeth in a sneer but it falls on Hela’s retreating back, losing any potential impact. Now alone, she settles into the sudden emotional whiplash from the interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their hook up after the bar, the looming deadline of the deposition, the way she’d been a bitch to Wanda and hasn’t seen her since, the notifications in the support group chat from people who have already done their depositions weighing her phone down in her pocket like lead. And now this– Rio’s outburst and subsequent dismissal. All of it builds in her throat, suffocating her with every breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     And why is Rio choosing now to be angry?
     <em>
      She’s
     </em>
     the one the left Agatha the other night, that had freaked and then disappeared. She had instigated going home together. If things had gone Agatha’s way, they wouldn’t have interacted that night at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha finishes pouring herself a drink amidst her mounting frustration. Of course she’d prepared herself for boring socialization with employees she barely knows and a lengthy car ride with a near stranger, but not for this. When she ever has been or ever will be prepared to be around Rio, Agatha doesn’t know.
    </p>
    <p>
     She takes a sip, drifting aimlessly into the kitchen. She finds Lilia there, leaning against her mammoth kitchen island while she talks to a set of people Agatha’s sure she’s never met. Her frustration latches on to this new target, ready to be offloaded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why did you invite her?” She asks Lilia, her tone clearly displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia shoots her an exasperated glance before smiling apologetically towards her guests, pushing off of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Excuse me one moment, would you?” Her voice is syrupy sweet, though Agatha can feel her annoyance through the hand that grips her upper arm and drags her out of the kitchen, down the hall, and into Lilia’s study. When the door clicks shut behind them, Lilia pins her with a look that Agatha long ago dubbed her Disappointed Parent Face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have you no manners at all?” She asks, almost pleading.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why is she
     <em>
      here
     </em>
     Lilia? You know we can’t be around each other.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re a grown woman and you’re already seeing one another just fine with all of this lawsuit business. And it’s my birthday Agatha, for crying out loud! You’ll be fine.” At Agatha’s crestfallen expression she reaches out, patting her consolingly on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know that I care for the both of you very much. She’s family just as much as you are. You can make it through one night.” Lilia gives her a soft smile before pulling the door open and disappearing back out into the hall, leaving Agatha alone in the study.
    </p>
    <p>
     She huffs out a deep sigh, digging the toe of her sandal into Lilia’s plush rug.
     <em>
      Why does everyone keep throwing around the F word? Jesus.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     But she does find it in herself to be a little remorseful, maybe. A bit chastised. Surely, she can be good for one night, can play nice and act normal and give Rio the space she so obviously needs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha finishes her drink in one gulp for courage and leaves the study, planning to get a refill and then enact her master plan. Fate, of course, has other plans.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stands alone at the bar cart, not pulling from any of Lilia’s classy offerings but instead rummaging around in the cooler next to it, filled with various beer cans and seltzers. Agatha hovers awkwardly in the archway, not sure what to do with her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looks over her shoulder at the shuffling sound, sees that it’s her, and turns her head back to her task without a word. Agatha grimaces, deciding to add one small extra step to her plan before committing to the whole space thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     She steps forward carefully, positioning herself at the far end of the cart from Rio and assembling her drink in silence for a second while she draws up her courage.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn’t mean it like that. I just–” she pauses, trying not to look like she’s scanning the side of Rio’s face for any minute reaction. There isn't one, anyway. “I thought it was a work thing. I wasn’t expecting you, is all.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Satisfied with her effort, Agatha lifts her glass and prepares to walk away. Rio turns though, looking her fully in the face. Her eyes remain unreadable, like trying to catch a reflection in a swift moving river. Agatha stills beneath her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know,” she says, turning back to the cooler and finally making a selection. It’s not an absolution but it’s not a condemnation, either. Just an acknowledgement, left to hang in the air between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nods even though she isn’t watching, walking to the living room before she can upset this tentative peace somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the next several hours, Agatha plays happy party guest. She sips her drink, slow and demure, and snacks on the various hors d'oeuvres that sit on pretty little trays throughout the kitchen and living room. She winds her way in and out of conversations with coworkers and strangers alike, enduring Hela’s ribbing and an increasingly tipsy Yelena’s ramblings about her girlfriend.
    </p>
    <p>
     She listens as Lilia tells a crowd of onlookers some absurd tale about one of their first clients and laughs at all of the right parts, even though she’s heard variations of it a thousand times and lived through the entire ordeal herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the while, as though they have a mind of their own, Agatha finds her eyes tracking Rio. The slope of her throat as she throws her head back to laugh, the tilt of her head when she’s listening to something interesting, the raising of an eyebrow that some idiot can’t tell means she’s making fun of him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The glass in Agatha’s hand sweats against her palm, beads of moisture sliding down the curve of her wrist. Maybe, if she were to analyze such things, she could admit the possibility that she had never given Rio any indication that she would be welcome to stay through to the morning. That, if anything, she had perhaps been projecting the opposite sentiment only hours before.
    </p>
    <p>
     That feeling settles in the hollow of her throat again– something like a quiet remorse. A creeping thought that she may have been wrong, even if only slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her thoughts are pulled back to the conversation she’s been pretending to take part in for the past 20 minutes, the group of people that she allegedly supervises breaking out in raucous laughter. She lets a small smile paint her face, hoping she looks engaged enough to not be off-putting but not so engaged that someone actually tries to talk to her. A fine line to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
     A bright eyed blonde leans into their circle conspiritorially, and Agatha marvels at how childlike she looks. Had she been like that in her early 20s?
    </p>
    <p>
     “Does anyone know who the hot, mean looking brunette is with Hela?” The blonde questions the group, her voice low as she focuses her eyes somewhere back past Agatha’s shoulder. “And if she’s single?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her counterparts devolve into a fit of giggles, surely aided by the alcohol, but Agatha feels her stomach drop. She doesn’t have to look to know what hot, mean looking brunette is. Would be embarrassed to be caught staring like the rest of her group is doing now.
    </p>
    <p>
     She takes it as her cue to be absolutely anywhere else, to release herself from this performance for at least a few minutes, and slips out of the back door and into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
     Evening has long since become night, and the garden is lit only by the open windows of Lilia’s brownstones and the ambient glow of the city lights. It’s a small space, but Lilia has somehow managed to fit in seemingly hundreds of plants and a small fountain so laden with moss and stones that it looks like a miniature pond.
    </p>
    <p>
     It feels like Lilia found a lush forest and picked it up, shoving it into the confines of her fenced in yard. Agatha steps out, letting vines and leaves brush her hands and legs as she makes her way to a small stone bench.
    </p>
    <p>
     She takes a seat and looks up, inhaling her first clear breath in hours. The city lights blow out any chance of seeing the stars here, but it’s kind of nice. Boston always reminds Agatha of her 20s and that youthful sense of invincibility that buoyed her– finally free from her mother’s house and not yet tainted by further tragedy. Everything was possible then.
    </p>
    <p>
     She drops her head, turning her face back toward the house. Agatha watches the party through the brownstone’s large windows, the warm glow of the lamplight illuminating the guests and their talking mouths. She can’t hear their words from here, but the music from Lilia’s record player filters out through the cracked doors and floats across the air, imbuing the garden with a feeling of something intimate for Agatha alone to experience.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha embraced that she was one half of a pair of magnets long ago, so she’s not surprised when her eyes find Rio, laughing with Lilia and Hela in the kitchen. She looks so light, so safe here. Agatha rubs absently at her arm with her free hand, thinking about how tense Rio had been when they’d spoken at the beginning of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
     The longer she’s been away from Agatha, the more relaxed she seems. Less fearful. Less angry. Agatha swallows around the lump that forms in her throat, reminds herself that this observation isn’t something new.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, the universally recognized truth about magnets is that they work both ways.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, Rio’s eyes find her through the glass and hold her stare across the darkness. The openness in her expression doesn’t fade, though. It lingers. Agatha feels the world narrowing, like there’s something about this moment that is supposed to matter a great deal. But it feels like they’re Jane Goodall and Washoe the chimp, getting close to something like meaningful communication but inevitably falling short.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio looks away, mouth opening to respond to whatever Hela had said, Agatha can breathe again. She turns her head fully away from the house and looks back up to where the stars should be. She hopes that somewhere, in another timeline maybe, they got something better than this. Something less jagged.
    </p>
    <p>
     In this timeline, Agatha sinks into the quiet solitude of the night. She returns to the party once she’s met her minimum threshold for silence, finding that the majority of the guests have already gone. She places her empty glass in the kitchen sink and wanders into the living room, finding Lilia gathering empty silver trays and Yelena curled into a ball on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha furrows her brow, walking over to the girl and shaking her shoulder lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yelena,” she says like a question. “What are you doing? It’s time to go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Yelena moans something entirely incoherent, curling in on herself further. Agatha groans, burying her fingers in her hair and turning to an amused Lilia.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What am I supposed to do? I don’t want to drive her weird little car or drag her drunk ass back home. What if she throws up?” Agatha pleads. She remembers something else, her expression growing somehow more pitiful. “I don’t even know her address, Lilia!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia rolls her eyes at the theatrics, moving to pick up another tray.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She can just sleep right there on the couch, it’s no trouble for me. And you can stay in the guest room tonight.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groans again, louder this time. Yelena mumbles something that could almost sound like
     <em>
      ‘stooloudimtryinsleep
     </em>
     before burying her face between the cushions. Agatha points at her dramatically, looking to Lilia like
     <em>
      are you seeing this?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia doesn’t bother responding, walking her handful of empty dishes back to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s not that staying over would be the absolute worst thing in the world, but the mattress in the guest bedroom is undeniably uncomfortable, and Agatha’s pretty sure the room is haunted. At least at home she knows all of the ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I could drive you back,” a voice behind her offers. Agatha closes her eyes at the sound, counting to three in her head before turning around to meet Rio’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     One hand is back in her pocket while the other swings her keys around, her hair tucked behind one ear to reveal a medley of piercings.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m about to head out anyway,” Rio shrugs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha weighs the options before her– a night in Lilia’s spooky, uncomfortable guest room or an hour and a half in the car with her ex-wife. She watches the keys swing around and around in the air while Rio waits for her response.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s not sure why Rio would offer, especially when she’d been so upset before. Agatha thinks of the two of them trapped in the car and wonders if it would be worse if they sat in silence or if she was forced into a conversation without any chance of escape. All of the alarms in her head are going off at once.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well?” Lilia says from the kitchen doorway, watching Agatha with one brow raised. Agatha looks up from the swinging keys and catches Rio’s eyes, holding them for a beat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fucking magnets. She nods.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio makes a sweeping gesture with her arm, and the two head for the front door.

    <p>
     Rio’s keys jangle in her hand as she takes Lilia’s front steps two at a time and leads them down to where she’d parked on the next street over, her steps casual and loose like this is something normal for them to be doing together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha checks her wristwatch once she’s cleared the steps, taking in the quiet of the city and musing that it must be later than she had initially thought. When she realizes it’s already past 11:30, she pushes down another groan. It’ll be nearly one in the morning by the time they make it back to the house. She’s too old for this shit. For every part of tonight, really.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Subaru comes into view, Rio clicking the remote so that the headlights flare to life. Agatha tries not to flinch at the sudden onslaught of light.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know, this car is so old that she could legally get a license of her own.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lifts her eyebrows and turns to look at Rio, surprised by the seemingly benign comment. The lengths she's going to to make this something meaningless. Agatha decides to play along.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well if she’s getting human milestones then you missed her quinceñera,” she finds herself responding as they near the vehicle, rounding the front to pull open the passenger side door. It’s all nonsense, the two of them speaking for the sake of filling the silent night air– none of this has to mean anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     It always does, though.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wonders if she’s going to have to pull small talk like this out of her ass for the entire drive, but things settle back into silence once they’re in the car and settled into their seats. There’s only the steady hum of the engine as Rio turns the keys in the ignition, the soft clicking of the turn signal as she navigates back out of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
     With Rio, there’s never a GPS. Or Bluetooth or an AUX cord for her phone or even a goddamn paper map. Just the compass in her brain that never seems to stray and a gut instinct that she’s always sworn would get them where they needed to go. Agatha had stopped questioning the possibility of getting lost a long time ago, but the peculiarity has never lost its novelty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gets them out of the city and onto the highway, the flat road stretching out endlessly behind and ahead of them in the dark. She reaches out a finger and presses play on the dashboard’s crusty CD player and it whirs to life, the discs shifting unseen before the first track starts.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment that it does, Agatha feels her chest tighten, propping an elbow on the car door to support her head while she stares at nothing in particular through her window. This is a mix she knows, one she’d watched Rio burn onto a disc in college.
    </p>
    <p>
     She can almost remember waking up on a warm Sunday morning in their first apartment, cocooned in the duvet and thoroughly pleased with how her first summer post-grad was shaping up. So far she’d been working at Lilia’s company for a few weeks, and everything felt like it was hers for the taking. Even the city felt new despite the four years she’d already spent there.
    </p>
    <p>
     The cold of the bed beside her wasn’t quite alarming, but it was enough of a disturbance that she had cracked an eye open to take stock of the room. The windows had all been flung open and the breeze sent the curtains billowing lazily in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     From across the tiny apartment she could hear Rio’s unmistakable voice singing quietly along to Billy Joel’s
     <em>
      Vienna
     </em>
     , carrying down the hall and through the open doorway. Agatha had groaned as she stretched, cat-like and indulgent, and Rio appeared as though she’d been waiting for the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning, gorgeous,” Rio chirped with a grin, waving the duster in her hand in greeting. She was wearing the same shorts and tank top that she’d gone to sleep in, but she’d added a stupid little black apron covered in cartoon skulls overtop. “Thoughts on pancakes?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shifts in the passenger seat, trying not to get too lost in the memory and yet unable to keep herself from remembering the feeling of looking at Rio that morning and feeling the burning weight of the ring in her nightstand, just waiting for a good enough time to ask her to marry her and terrified that she would say no. She tosses a glance to Rio’s hands on the steering wheel and wonders where that ring is now.
    </p>
    <p>
     The playlist carries on through the fuzzy speakers, both soothing and taunting in its familiarity. The first notes of
     <em>
      Landslide
     </em>
     play and Agatha sees from the corner of her eye as Rio hums quietly along, her right hand dropping away from the wheel and shifting over like it’s going to settle on Agatha’s thigh like it used to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead the hand stops halfway through the air, resting jerkily on the gear shift. Agatha releases a quiet exhale through her nose. How much of each of their lives is now just muscle memory, she wonders? An old habit that they can’t seem to kick?
    </p>
    <p>
     How much of this is a choice anymore?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lets her eyes fall shut, leaning back against the headrest. Stevie Nicks’ voice croons through the car, winding it’s way around her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Well I’ve been afraid of changing, ‘cause I built my life around you
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She squeezes her eyes tighter, like maybe she can block out not only light but sound, too. Agatha is just on the right side of loose from the alcohol for her usual steel wall of resolve to become something closer to a paper sheet, leaving her feeling far too vulnerable. Sitting in their car, listening to one of their CDs, driving back to their house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everything smells like Rio and feels like home, and something forms an iron grip around her ribcage at the notion and squeezes.
    </p>
    <p>
     As though the same feeling has somehow traveled to her body from Agatha’s, Rio asks “are we going to talk about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her voice is barely audible over the combination of the music and the buzz of tires on asphalt, but the words reach Agatha as if they’ve been screamed through a bullhorn. And Agatha knows what she’s asking, what she means. How in one open, vulnerable moment they had molded back to one another without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
     She doesn’t want to have this fight. She wants to sweep it under the rug, along with everything else that they’ve let pile up there. Wants to leave it alone so that the scar tissue can properly reform, but
    </p>
    <p>
     “Which part?” She asks. Tired and resigned to her fate as a captive of this car ride.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio seems to think on it, like she really only gets to pick one part and wants to choose wisely.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Were you really going to go home with someone else?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The question takes Agatha by surprise. It’s not what she thought would have Rio so wound up, of all things. And it probably isn’t. More likely it was just the first thing that came to mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha thinks back to the bar and the one scan she’d done upon arrival. She thinks of the woman with the pink hair and the arrogant smirk touching her face and the bad feeling it had left in her gut. Agatha shakes her head even though Rio isn’t looking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She almost leaves it at that, but something about the two of them sitting side by side and watching the road ahead feels like the booth of a confessional– an echo born of a childhood spent in the Catholic church.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I’m ruined for anyone else.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wants it to come out like a dig, but the words fall flat and heavy. She waits for Rio to push or maybe confirm that she’s not sleeping with anyone else either, but she does neither. Rio is silent for the time that it takes to flick her turn signal and switch lanes, speaking when the rhythmic clicking fades away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay. Your turn to ask something,” she prompts.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s unexpected and unfamiliar– not a finger digging into a bruise but a seemingly full retreat. Agatha feels unmoored, glancing down at her own hands in her lap. She’s already exposed, isn’t she?
    </p>
    <p>
     “When you came to the house in May, was it just an apology?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Blood heats her cheeks as the words leave her, but the question has been lingering in the pit of her stomach even after Rio said she hadn’t fucked with her phone. She knows that behind her bravado, Rio can hear what she’s really asking.
     <em>
      Do you even still want me? Is this how we quantify things now? What’s real and what’s not?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio clears her throat, rolling her neck like the question is making her tense. Her brow furrows, though she keeps her eyes firmly on the road. Agatha finds, with a certain level of intrigue, that she’s scared to hear the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” she breathes at last. “I’d had a rough day. And I wanted– I didn’t want to be alone. I thought it would help get my mind off of things.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She shrugs, like this is nothing. Like she isn’t confessing to something as awful as feeling like things were bad enough that she needed Agatha and knowing that the only way she could have her was physically. And Agatha remembers that she hadn’t been kind– she’d been hard and harsh and taking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Apologizing after was just something that was on my mind and it just sort of came out. I guess I didn’t realize it came off that way.” She sighs, running her fingertips along the seam of the leather steering wheel. “And then you reacted like that and I was embarrassed. I left as soon as you went into the bathroom.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stares at the side of her face and feels the knowledge sink in. All of it is so fucked up, isn’t it? That Agatha had thought Rio had come over to pity fuck her as an excuse to break into her phone and then heard her freak out in the bathroom and ignored it. That Rio had needed comfort and thought that the only thing close would be Agatha’s unforgiving hands. That she’d come home for those hands anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     That their once beautiful tether is now this snarled, mangled nest.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fragile scab that’s been holding together the open wound of Agatha’s heart tears clean off. She’s hemorrhaging, the blood is everywhere– in her throat and on her hands and filling the car. They’re both up to their teeth in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she had just been different– could just be someone different, someone softer– maybe this wouldn’t all be so agonizing. But it is. She is.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you think we were always going to end up like this?” Agatha asks after a beat, swallowing around the thickness in her throat. The very first acknowledgement of the game that they play.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even though she knows it’s not her turn to ask a question, this one has been rolling around in her skull for years, now marble-smooth from all of her prodding. Who else can she ask if not Rio? For her part, Rio doesn’t look hurt in the corner of Agatha’s eye. Just contemplative.
    </p>
    <p>
     The quiet between them stretches along the highway. The CD skips slightly as it switches songs, and Agatha knows exactly where the scratch on the disc is that causes it. Rio’s hand lifts from the gear shift and wraps feather light around Agatha’s forearm, sliding down until her fingers gently cradle her wrist and her thumb rests over her pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe I would if I thought that when things get hard it means it’s the end. But if I let myself believe that then I wouldn’t have made it to adulthood. I don’t think either of us would have.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And it’s steady, it’s sure. It’s just like Rio to cut straight to Agatha’s core and unravel her from the inside out. Agatha lets Rio’s touch on her arm stay, soft and warm, leaning into it ever so slightly like a sunflower seeking light. She tries to find it in herself to pull away and comes up empty handed.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lets the tears pool at her lashline like she could fight them if she tried, watching the tail lights ahead of them blur into red gashes against the inky black night. When her cheeks turn damp as they fall, she pretends she doesn’t feel it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m so tired, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hardly recognizes her own voice, so small and without a single protective barrier left. But it's true. All of it is exhausting- her rage and her pain and the fondness for Rio that never goes away. The aching loneliness that dogs her every step. She wants to take back this show of weakness but finds that she can't.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hand around her wrist gives a faint squeeze, shifting until their fingers are interlocked and resting on Agatha’s thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know, baby.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s all that she says. All that she needs to say. There is no game, no ploy. Nothing bloodthirsty between them rearing its ugly head. Just a bit of something honest, taking a piece of Agatha with it as it goes. Just a lapse in judgment that she can blame on the alcohol tomorrow, a brief reprieve from holding the only support system that she's ever had to her knife. Their hands stay intertwined for the rest of the drive.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time Rio pulls the car into the driveway, Agatha has pulled herself back together. There are no traces of tears on her cheeks, no tremble to her jaw. Just a tiredness that clings to her skin and the nagging feeling that this car ride has taken years off of her life. Rio withdraws her hand slowly and without a word, watching as Agatha unbuckles her seatbelt and opens the door. Only when she’s all of the way out of the car and about to close the door behind her does Rio call out.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” she says, “next time, call me and I’ll come. Meeting at the bar was too expensive.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha doesn’t laugh at the attempted humor, seeing the truth in Rio’s wide, nervous eyes instead. She hesitates for half a second, her hand still gripping the car door. None of her internal defenses come to her aid.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And if you– if it’s bad again, you can be here. If you need that.” She falters. “We don’t have to do anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It feels like a dangerous thing to offer even as it leaves her– the opening of a door she’s kept very securely and intentionally shut. But Rio’s eyes shimmer as she nods back, her bottom lip pulled between her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Bye,” she says with an awkward wave, catching Rio’s returned
     <em>
      te veo
     </em>
     as she shuts the door and makes her way up to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha traces the mindless path from the front door up to her bedroom, letting her feet carry her straight to the back of the closet on Rio’s all but empty side. She pulls out the purple cardigan from where she’d set it all the way back in April, still neatly folded.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lifts it to her nose and takes a deep inhale. It smells just as much like Rio as it did when she gave it back. Agatha drags her dress up over her head with little ceremony, leaving it in a heap on the closet floor and buttoning the cardigan over her bare skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     She walks back out of the closet to rummage through Rio’s dresser drawers, pulling out a pair of ratty old sleep shorts and sliding them up her legs. Climbing onto the usually empty half of her bed, Agatha burrows herself beneath the covers like she can block the whole world out this way.
    </p>
    <p>
     She falls asleep wondering,
     <em>
      if this isn’t the end, then what is?
     </em>

    <p>
     July is slowly, slowly melting its way into August. It is so fucking hot in Massachusetts. Agatha tries to trace every life decision that has led her here, sprawled on the floor of her bedroom in front of her oscillating fan.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her phone vibrates from a foot away, the sound muffled by the rug. She knows it’s probably Alice, looking to confirm that they’re still on for lunch later. Agatha doesn’t reach for it, content to remain utterly still so as to not get any sweatier than she already is.
    </p>
    <p>
     She doesn’t know why she said yes when Alice had reached out to invite her to lunch with her and Jen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, that’s not entirely true.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had woken up the morning after Lilia’s party determined to chock the whole car ride with Rio up to a drunken disaster, except she very much so had not been drunk. Neither had Rio, obviously. And instead of burying itself when Agatha pushed at it, the memory seemed to pop up more often out of spite. The brush of Rio’s thumb over her pulse while she’s washing her face. Their eyes locking through the kitchen window when Wanda goes on a tangent about some reality show she’s watching. The steady timbre of Rio’s voice calling her baby when she’s trying to fall asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     So when Alice’s text came through a few days later, the distraction seemed like it could be nice. Helpful, even. Maybe Agatha could remind her body of its anxiety over her upcoming deposition by asking how theirs went and then the adrenaline surge would make it impossible for her to think about anything else. Or so she can hope.
    </p>
    <p>
     At long last she rises, forcing herself into a tank top and a pair of linen shorts, pairing the ensemble with an old, worn in pair of sandals before bracing herself and heading out the door. Agatha lives in a northern state for a reason, thank you very much. She’s supposed to be safe from heat waves and humidity levels over 75%.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha pulls up to the cafe downtown that they’d agreed to meet in she finds that it’s much nicer than when she’d last stopped in years before. Swirling vines weave up and over a trellis that serves as an awning of sorts over the front door, a simple hand-printed open sign swaying in the window. She trudges across the parking lot and pushes through the door, the crisp blast of the air conditioning a balm to her sweat-damp skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen aren’t hard to spot, already stationed at a round table nearly in the center of the small dining area. Agatha’s surprised to see Lorna with them, though she realizes she shouldn’t be. When she waves off the hostess and makes her way to the table, it’s Lorna who looks up to greet her first. Her wedge of the table is already overrun with sheets of blank paper and a small pack of crayons merely awaiting her idle hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hi.” She squints at Agatha, almost assessing. “You were at the gym. But you didn’t come back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha squints at her right back, ignoring the way Alice and Jen have pulled away from whatever conversation they were having to watch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very astute, aren’t you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lorna’s face scrunches up at Agatha and she can almost hear the little gears in her brain whirring to life as she tries to figure out whether this foreign word is a compliment or a dig. It ultimately doesn’t matter either way when Jen pulls a pair of headphones with little cat ears out of her purse connected to a purple iPod, the likes of which Agatha’s sure she hasn’t seen since the early aughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lorna lights up at the sight, taking the offerings from her mother and securing the headphones squarely over her ears, dwarfing her tiny head. Immediately she seems to forget all about Agatha, settling in to color with pinched brows, her head bobbing slightly to her music. Agatha finds herself momentarily charmed by the single-minded focus that kids can have, part of the world one second and somewhere else entirely the next.
    </p>
    <p>
     She snaps herself from her reverie, pivoting to give a pointed look between Jen and the iPod as she sits in the chair between Alice and Lorna. Jen huffs, rolling her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     raising an iPad baby. That’s like the only thing left without a screen.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugs, making a face like
     <em>
      if you say so
     </em>
     before Alice can cut in, clearly trying to steer them all away from any tension.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s good to see you, Agatha. Have you been here before? The Witches’ Road is one of our favorites.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She respects Alice’s attempt, really. Even lets herself play along for a second.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, but not in a long time. Last time I was here I’m pretty sure it was still legal to smoke inside and the kitchen staff was taking full advantage.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen barks a cough into her fist that sounds an awful lot like
     <em>
      old
     </em>
     and Agatha turns away from Alice, narrowing her eyes. “And how was summer camp, Jen? Make any friends? Braid anyone’s hair while you talked about boys?” Agatha props her chin on her fist, batting her lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s right eye twitches, like she’s having World War II-esque flashbacks to being around so many children. “I liked you better when you were having a panic attack. At least then you were quiet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice gives a nervous little chuckle, glancing between the two of them. “Do you guys already know what you want to order? It’s such a big menu, so hard to decide.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha keeps her eyes on Jen, finding the smirk on her face turning into something closer to genuine. She likes the feeling of the volley, the way that Jen doesn’t so much as flinch when Agatha flashes her claws. And based on the mischief dancing in her eyes through her feigned disgust, Jen doesn’t seem to mind either.
    </p>
    <p>
     A waitress comes by shortly after and takes their order and the atmosphere shifts into something quieter, more like what Agatha had expected this lunch would be. She lets Alice tell some long-winded story about her job as a mall cop for a while, even asking questions when called for before she starts to feel that itch beneath her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     They’re not friends really, the three of them. They’re only…what, co-plaintiffs? Acquaintances via a legal proceeding? Whatever they are, Agatha doesn’t believe that the two of them invited her here to talk about work and the weather. She shifts in her seat, throwing her hair over her chair to keep it off of her back before cutting Alice off mid-sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, do you two woo all of the other plaintiffs before their depositions, or is this your weird roundabout way of hunting for a third? Because I’m flattered ladies, really, but I don’t think you could keep up with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She tosses in a wink for good measure, but her discomfort at feeling like she’s in the dark and her anxiety around talking about the deposition make the joke fall flat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice visibly grimaces. Rude. Jen shoots an incredulous glance between Agatha and Lorna, who remains entirely oblivious as she reaches to switch colors.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Damn, Harkness,” Jen says, clearly amused. “You must really be bent out of shape about this if that’s the best you can do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha only rolls her eyes, but Alice shoots her a sympathetic look anyway. Really, what is it with this woman and all of her empathy? It seems exhausting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice pauses for a second like she’s deliberating before finally opening her mouth, her tone much softer than Jen’s had been. “Have you gotten the chance to talk to Rio at all about the deposition stuff? Stephen said you guys were doing your prep separately and I know your date is coming up pretty soon.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She feels an awkward grimace cross her face before she can push it back, quickly schooling her face back to neutrality. Rio had tried, maybe, to talk to her about it at the bar. But then they had very much not talked about it. They hadn’t talked very much at all after that, actually. Agatha taps the ends of her nails against her jaw, pretending to think it over.
    </p>
    <p>
     Is Stephen even allowed to tell them her business like that? Is there not some sort of lawyer version of HIPAA? And more importantly, can they not just talk about the non-Rio parts of the deposition? It’s daunting enough as is.
    </p>
    <p>
     The waitress, god bless her, chooses that moment to bring their food out. Agatha takes advantage of the pause to game plan how to deflect, picking up her fork and stabbing it into her salad once the plates have all been left on the table and the waitress is gone again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did Stephen tell you anything else? Because last I heard from him he was pretty pissed that we’re not legally divorced. Said it really fucked up his argument.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She shovels an overlarge bite into her mouth when she’s done, watching Jen’s lack of acknowledgement while she cuts Lorna’s chicken tenders into little pieces and Alice’s brief but wide-eyed shock. Alice is quick to pull herself back together, Agatha will give her that. She shrugs one shoulder and picks up a fry from her plate, taking a bite before gesturing with the half still between her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wouldn’t worry about it, honestly. Stephen is good at his job and I’m sure it won’t actually matter in the long run. He was probably just stressed– the people Perlman got for this are ruthless.”
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha glances over again, Jen is watching her with an unwavering sort of focus that makes her feel exposed despite Alice’s placating words, like Jen can see straight through her. Agatha shifts her eyes back down to the salad she’s maiming, deciding how to best get the focus back off of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sounds like a doozy then if it’s got him that wound up. How did your deposition go?” She shovels in another bite.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen both seem to seize up at the question. It’s not the same sort of tense that Jen had been after remembering Lorna’s summer camp but something deeper, something that looks like it hurts to remember. Her stomach flips uneasily. When she swallows, it feels like rocks in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice’s arm moves, like she’s squeezing Jen’s leg under the table. She clearly tries to offer Agatha what’s supposed to be a reassuring smile, but all of her teeth are bared.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Our case is definitely strong,” she starts, her eyes darting to her daughter of their own volition before she meets Agatha’s gaze again. “And Stephen kept them on their back foot most of the time. But they were really coming for our throats.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice’s voice is quiet, like if she talks about it any louder it would make it more real. Agatha sees that fire from the first time they met flickering behind her pupils, something white hot and vicious pulled to the surface by the memory. Beside her, the muscle of Jen’s jaw flexes, her emotion quieter but no less visible.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They were playing cards I didn’t even know a person could pull,” she adds. “I can respect dirty, underhanded moves when they’re done well, but they were way too bold with that shit. I think I would have killed them if this didn’t matter so much.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen says it like it’s not an exaggeration, only a fact.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shudders slightly before she can help it, feeling worse off for having asked. She can’t even begin to wonder what the fuck the two of them mean, trying to wrestle her brain to the floor before it can race ahead and draw some horrifying conclusion about how her own deposition will go.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her stomach clenches violently, and Agatha feels glad she at least got in a few bites before her appetite fled. She pushes the salad away, tapping out a steady rhythm with her fingers on the table in the now empty space.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice’s eyes track the movement, her expression softening.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I’m sure they went so hard on us since we’re the primary plaintiffs. I doubt they’ll push everyone like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tries and fails to give some sort of show of polite gratitude, the corners of her lips twitching up before falling back down just as quickly. Alice doesn’t seem to mind, though. When she speaks again, Agatha can tell that she’s being intentionally gentle. It makes her ever simmering rage rise to a slow boil.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you’re not comfortable doing the deposition with Rio, I’m sure Stephen could sway them to let you guys do it–”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      No
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s voice rises from her chest and passes through her lips without her permission, the word coming out loud and fast. Her eyes widen as Alice falls quiet, but she doesn’t take it back.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only thing that could possibly be worse than doing the deposition with Rio would be to do it without her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen catches her eye again, staring her down with that same intense look. This time something similar seems to cross Alice’s face and the alarm bells start ringing somewhere distantly in Agatha’s mind. This conversation is clearly about to veer somewhere she won’t be able to pull it back from.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s Lorna’s voice that rings out next, startling them all from their three way staring contest and saving Agatha from what was bound to become an interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I like Miss Rio,” she says sagely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her big headphones rest around her neck, clearly having come off at some point when Agatha wasn’t paying attention. Lorna’s brown eyes are big and owlish, sparkling as they lock onto Agatha’s with the same focus she’d devoted to her coloring.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She taught me how to bounce a basketball.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen look like they’re watching a car crash in slow motion, bracing for something horrific to happen. Jen grips her fork tightly in her fist, like she’s made her peace with the fact that she may have to use it to fight Agatha off of her small child. To their credit, Agatha knows that while they’ve been humoring her today, they’ve seen the monster that she is. They have every right to be afraid of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it’s almost like when Billy and Tommy will bring up Nicky to her at random– something that would earn her rage from an adult but instead draws out a softness when delivered by their young, earnest voices.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did she now?” Agatha asks, playing up her interest. At Lorna’s enthusiastic nod, she continues, finding herself smiling along with the girl. “Miss Rio used to play basketball at our school, a long time ago. Did she show you how to shoot the ball too?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lorna’s eyes grow impossibly wider, clearly delighted with Agatha’s engagement and the gift of new information about her friend. She holds up her hands, spreading her fingers out like she’s clutching an invisible basketball. Agatha’s heart gives a painful
     <em>
      thump
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uh huh! She held me up to the basket ‘cause I’m too small to reach it myself. But she said when I get big ‘n tall I’ll be really really good at it.” She nods solemnly, like Rio’s words had been a prophecy. Despite herself, the corners of Agatha’s lips tilt up further.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sees Alice and Jen find each other’s hands beneath the table out of the corner of her eye, and she knows what they’re thinking. They’re watching their daughter and wondering if her small, sick body will ever heal enough for her to be big and tall and do something as simple as run around and play a game of basketball. Wondering if by sheer willpower alone they can give her the future that she deserves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha finds her own mind wandering, pulling on the thread of a thought until she’s remembering a small plastic hoop in the driveway that became a real hoop as Nicky got bigger, lingering to watch him and Rio laughing and giggling and running in circles around one another before calling them both inside for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
     It stings like salt water in a wound, but it feels cleansing all the same. Something in her loosens with the quiet relief that Rio still gets to have moments like that– passing on her knowledge and her enthusiasm and her care, even if it isn’t to her own boy. Their boy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lorna, oblivious as ever and having reached the end of her thought, goes right back to coloring. She picks up the pink crayon and begins scribbling something indecipherable with the concentration of a renowned artist. For a moment, Agatha only watches.
    </p>
    <p>
     The deposition terrifies her. The support group and Alice and Jen’s attention and all of the people suddenly present in her once-silent life all terrify her. But if this lawsuit can do anything at all to help the kids like Lorna– to fight for their futures and their dreams and a sense of justice for their suffering– then maybe Agatha can live with that. If she has to.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought crumples something in her chest before smoothing it back out again, her breath skipping and settling back down. It’s not the blinding sense of dread about the deposition she'd come here hoping for, but it’s something to hold her attention in the meantime. Agatha signals for the waitress and asks for the check.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen both splutter for a moment when the waitress brings back a single check and Agatha hands her card over without looking, something like indignation on their features. Agatha rolls her eyes, unwilling to play out the song and dance of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re not some charity case, Agatha. We don’t need your pity,” Jen snaps.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, it’s Agatha’s turn to look at Jen like she’s stupid enough for it to qualify as a medical marvel. The look feels much better to give than it did to receive.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re right. You wouldn’t be having your lunch paid for if you were. I would never give my hard earned money to charity.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The lie is immediately worth it if only for the look of total slack-jawed shock on Jen’s face that quickly curdles into a cross between disgust and begrudging respect as she watches Agatha stand from her chair, signing the check that the waitress drops back off. Alice watches them both with thinly-veiled amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There is something seriously wrong with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha flashes an award winning smile. “There sure is, Jenny Kale. Let’s hope Perlman’s guys can finally get to the bottom of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, Agatha leaves the cafe with a flourish, giving no parting beyond a small wave tossed to– and eagerly returned by– Lorna. Despite the choking heat that greets her outside, Agatha’s still smiling long after the door has chimed shut behind her.

    <p>
     With the lunch with Alice and Jen beneath her belt, Agatha drags her churning thoughts along into the work week.
    </p>
    <p>
     She dials into her mandatory team calls, ignores several dozen important emails, and shoots Hela a text about the upcoming marketing report that hits every buzzword without saying anything of substance at all. So long as her thoughts stay clear of the fact that her deposition for the lawsuit is only a week away, it’ll be fine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hasn’t thought about returning to the support group either, despite Lorna’s subtle guilt tripping. It wouldn’t do anything to soothe her uneasiness, and those people post every goddamn thought they have in the group chat anyway, so it’s not like she’s missing out.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, Agatha’s phone has buzzed for every single meeting reminder, doctor’s appointment update, and post-deposition celebration. At this point it probably qualifies as a vibrator in its own right. When it chimes again against her kitchen counter, Agatha doesn’t think to step away from the half-cooked risotto she’s stirring on the stovetop, content to let whatever asinine comment Jeff Kaplan has made wait.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s only a moment later when the buzzing stops being an intermittent sound and becomes a solid stream that Agatha glances up, watching a veritable flood of messages flash across her home screen. Frustrated, she sets her wooden spoon down and turns, scooping the device up and scanning the first message that she sees. Her stomach drops, ice pouring into her veins.
    </p>
    <p>
     Someone else’s kid is dead.
    </p>
    <p>
     It isn’t one of the couples Agatha met, she doesn’t think. She tries scanning back in her memory to Alice’s run down on the night she’d gone, but there are no faces she can put with the names in the messages. Only a concept, an abstract imagining that holds her throat in its crushing grip.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are condolences and messages of shared sorrow, memories offered of their son’s laughter or his mischief or his resilience. Apologies. An acknowledgement that he had been doing so well, that they thought things had been looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha breathes through the stabbing ache in her chest; a hurt for both these people that she doesn’t know and for her own memories that their loss invokes. She shuts her eyes against the onslaught, clutching at the phone in her hand like it could ever save her.
    </p>
    <p>
     They’d tucked Nicky into bed no more than an hour before, pressing two kisses to his crown and shutting off the lights. His anguished cry had reached them down the hall like thunder splitting open the sky, and in memory they were out of their bed and by his side in less than two seconds flat. Even then, it hadn’t been quick enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     She remembers his little body, unresponsive even as Rio shook his shoulders and hoisted him into her arms. It had been a nightmare, maybe. Something that had scared her baby so badly that it ruptured the aneurysm in his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
     His messy hair that Rio had always joked came from Agatha tucked behind his ears, his rumpled dinosaur pajamas, his stuffed rabbit curled against his chest like it could protect him. They’d brought the rabbit with them in the ambulance, she remembers, so he could have it when he woke up.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tears that glistened on his reddened cheeks and the unimaginable horror of knowing that there was nothing that she could do to help him. That handful of nauseating minutes that they'd waited for the ambulance. Nicky died four hours later in a bright, stale room, lying in a hospital bed while Agatha gripped one of his hands and Rio held the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     When finally they had to pull away– hours or days or lifetimes later– his little hands were ghost white, like he’d donned a pair of gloves. Contact blanching, Agatha had seen it called some time later. When someone dies and the people who love them can’t let go, the pressure of their touch displacing the now stagnant blood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Snow white skin left behind to go where their hands can’t follow, as if to say
     <em>
      I don’t know where you’re going next, but please take my love with you. I wouldn't know what to do with all of it anyway.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The sting in her eyes comes hot and fast. She leaves them shut, counting each shaky breath until the feeling dissipates into something quieter. When it does, she sets her phone back on the counter face down, silencing the ringer.
    </p>
    <p>
     There’s no message she could send that would help those people. She’d be just another mouth spewing the same stream of useless bullshit that won’t bring their kid back, a name with no face joining the endless choir amplifying their agony. For a moment Agatha considers calling Wanda instead, though the thought sours as soon as it comes. They may be friends now, but what could Wanda realistically do about it? And why should Agatha pull her away from her two living children just to console her about her dead one?
    </p>
    <p>
     An acrid smell fills her nose and her eyes shoot back to the stove, finding her risotto less than thirty seconds away from becoming a true fire hazard. She lifts the pan and snaps the burner off, throwing a lid over what will certainly be an offering to her trash can and setting it aside to be dealt with later. No dinner, then. She presses the heels of her hands into her eyes and shakes her head to clear the scream building in her throat. Some of her hair falls loose from the bun she’d thrown it into at the motion, whispering across the backs of her knuckles.
     <em>
      It doesn't matter.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pivots, leaving her phone in the kitchen and settling onto the couch. Maybe mindless TV can take up enough space in her head to drive out the bone-deep ache of memory threatening to sweep her under its tide. She flips through the channels if only to feel the grounding pressure of the remote in her hand, finally settling on something at random. Agatha wiggles further into the cushions, trying to find a shred of relief in the fact that she’d already changed into a tank top and sweats before making dinner and doesn’t have to drag her body up the stairs right now to change.
    </p>
    <p>
     She gets fifteen minutes– the opening shot of the plane, the reading of the quote, the establishing of some nefarious mystery– before there’s a knock at her door. Agatha looks between the TV and the bit of the foyer that she can see from her spot, debating if anything that might be on the other side of that door could be worth losing her progress towards total disassociation. But the knock comes again, albeit quieter, less sure. She goes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tries to summon some emotion when she sees her through the frosted glass but finds, pulling the door open and looking Rio in the face, that there is only the numbness that has been creeping in since she checked her phone. Rio’s still in her work clothes– a high neck sleeveless blouse and black slacks– though her briefcase is nowhere to be seen. Her hands, usually tucked into her pockets, are fidgeting at her sides.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      She’s nervous
     </em>
     , Agatha realizes. It’s only apparent because she’s really looking at her, not looking through her or searching for some hidden motive. Just looking, seeing. Agatha doesn’t have the energy to do more than that.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she sees that Rio is nervous and somehow almost shy and definitely upset. Not angry, though. Rio’s eyes flash around Agatha’s face, darting behind her into the dimly lit house before coming back into focus. She clears her throat and opens her mouth, only nothing comes out. A quiet, shaky sigh passes through her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha remembers, with a startling clarity, what she had said after Lilia’s party. The offer she had made. A line forms, tracing from the memory to a new thought and circling once– Rio is in the support group text chain, too. She must have seen the messages.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who goes to the stupid meetings frequently enough to teach Lorna how to shoot a basketball and to woo the Kaplans. Enough that Alice references her with an easy familiarity. Enough that maybe she knew these people and their son. Or maybe she didn’t. The possibility stings in Agatha’s chest all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m watching
     <em>
      Criminal Minds
     </em>
     ,” Agatha says. The calm, even tone of her voice surprises her. “Paget Brewster’s first season.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio visibly relaxes, some of the tension bleeding from her frame as her shoulders drop a hair. Agatha can see it, then. The armor she’d put on, unsure if she had been right to take Agatha at her word. But Rio had come anyway, half expecting to be berated.
    </p>
    <p>
     The stinging in Agatha’s chest twists into a full burn, the flames singeing her ribs and licking at the bars around her heart. She knows she was right to be angry, was justified in her isolation and her rage and her distance. Even so, this feeling has always lingered to some degree in the aftermath– this baseline, gut-wrenching sorrow at seeing Rio be wary of her. Even when Agatha knows she’s the reason, knows why she had to do it, that voice always comes back to remind her that as much as she’d lost a safe place in Rio, Rio had lost a safe place in her too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha steps aside and watches in silence as Rio crosses the threshold, pulling her shoes off and setting them dutifully on the rack before heading to the living room, perching herself just on the end of the couch by the armrest. Agatha catches herself before she can say something stupid like
     <em>
      that’s not your spot
     </em>
     and closes the front door instead, joining her in the living room and settling back into her seat on the other side. The distance feels exaggerated, and when Agatha inhales it feels like shards of glass are rattling around in her lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
     The air crackles with something quiet and tense while the show plays on. Agatha tries to focus back on the episode, but she can see Rio shifting out of the corner of her eye. Can hear her every breath, Finally, if only for the sake of doing something with her hands, Agatha picks herself up and goes upstairs, rooting around for a minute before going back down to the living room. Rio looks small and uncertain from the landing, suspicious in the way a stray cat would be of a human trying to coax it out from behind a dumpster.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tosses the contents of her hands into Rio's lap– an old pair of boxer shorts and a white hoodie with a faded ABBA print across the front.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s dumb to sit here in your work clothes. You can borrow these.”
    </p>
    <p>
     If Rio thinks anything about how Agatha is offering to loan her her own clothes, she doesn’t mention it. She merely dips her head in acknowledgement, the corners of her lips quirking upward in a movement so brief Agatha can’t be sure she didn’t imagine it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She rises, disappearing into the little guest bathroom back behind the kitchen. Agatha exhales, the knot in her chest loosening ever so slightly as she lowers back onto the couch. The spell that had made everything feel drawn taut is broken, but now what? She feels like her mind is lagging three steps behind.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio reemerges with her clothes folded neatly in her hand and the sleeves of her hoodie pushed up on her arms, it feels oddly like seeing a mirage. She sets the stack carefully on the table before stopping in the kitchen on the way back. Agatha listens to the cabinet open and shut as Rio pulls down a glass, shuffling over to the fridge to fill it with water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, here in her pajamas with Agatha on a week night, watching TV. Rio, moving around the house like it’s hers because it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     The shuffling stops, the water dispenser going quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I genuinely can’t tell what you were trying to cook in this pan,” Rio’s voice floats in from around the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinks once, twice. “Don’t talk about my risotto like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her laughter carries in before her head pops around, leaning over the sink to see Agatha in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you want water while I’m up?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha opens her mouth, finds that she doesn’t trust her voice, and closes it again. She swallows, shaking her head. Rio nods, a small smile still on her face as she flips off the kitchen light and walks back around to take her seat once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     The silence that they settle into is no longer tense but still Agatha takes no comfort in it, fighting against the urge to grind her teeth as something like panic sinks in instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s number was blocked for a reason. They didn’t talk beyond cruel jabs for a reason. They didn’t see one another outside of sex for a reason. Her eyes flash as she blinks, a memory of a different day in this room clawing at the walls of her skull.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had been on the phone with someone– Lilia or Hela or some other unfortunate soul she’d worked with at the time. She can’t remember what she’d said, only the warm relief of the venom-coated words leaving her throat and the weight of Rio’s eyes boring into her from the landing. Agatha knew, even before she’d finished the conversation, that this was going to be another fight. She hung up the phone and set it in her lap, looking at Rio with that still sort of calm that reeks of madness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you acting like this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the most straightforward Rio had been about it, typically opting to tip toe around the whole thing when they were alone. Agatha batted her eyelashes, giving a mock pout.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Acting like what, honey? Is my grief not pretty enough for you? Hoping I'll do a little song and dance?” She can still remember how Rio had flinched, a sight that wasn’t new by then but stung all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just
     <em>
      talk
     </em>
     to me, Agatha! I can’t bear to see you hurting yourself like this. Tell me how I can help you,” she pleaded, those big eyes glassing over in their desperation. Of course, Rio wanted to fix her. Had wanted what everyone wanted– for Agatha to be less, to be better. To be something easier to ingest when her soul had just been torn from her body. Or at least it had felt that way.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sneered, ignoring the plea. “If you can’t bear to see it then don’t fucking watch, Einstein. I’m sure the members of your little fan club are tripping over themselves to suck your dick, why don’t you go ahead and let them?” Agatha gave a dismissive wave of her hand to punctuate the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s features twisted from the middle ground of confusion and into fury. It felt like a veil being lifted, like Agatha was finally getting to see something true, even if it made her blood run cold.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s not just yourself you’re hurting, you know that? It’s everyone around you, anyone you think you can sink your claws into. You’re hurting
     <em>
      me
     </em>
     , you fucking selfish cunt.
     <em>
      Our
     </em>
     <em>
      son
     </em>
     is dead and all you care about is your twisted little power trip. Do I even matter to you anymore?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She was screaming, her voice working its way to a crescendo. When Rio was done her chest heaved with the labor of her breathing, shaking against the rage lining her frame. But Agatha only looked at her. Empty. Resentful. So isolated in the prison of her own grief that not even Rio could get her out again, not even Rio could pry her way through the bars.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha remembers the words hitting her ears as though they had come from someone very far away, all significance lost on her. She remembers the disappointment, the fleeting hope that Rio’s anger would draw something other than the same out in herself quickly dashed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though they’re garbled in her memory, Agatha’s sure there was more screaming after that, more words hurled like fists. They all slip like water through her hands until the memory stalls again, thick and sticky in her mind as the ending comes into view. Rio’s face, tear stained and resigned, looking for all the world like Agatha had cracked her in half.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That was all she’d said. No signature
     <em>
      te veo
     </em>
     , no pleading to make it work. Just a suitcase rolling behind her and her car keys in her hand. Agatha can still hear the door shutting behind her, not quite a slam but not gentle. Can remember the hush that had fallen over the house, like even the beams holding the structure together knew that Agatha was finally alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha remembers wondering, when she still hadn’t moved minutes later, when Rio had packed. And then weeks later, when she started to feel something closer to lucid, how she could have let Rio leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     How could she have betrayed all of her vows, forsaken all of the oaths they’d whispered in dorm rooms and on back roads and huddled together on the floor of their brand new empty house? How could Agatha abandon the only woman she’d ever love?
    </p>
    <p>
     But she had. Had all but pushed her to the door and waved as she walked through it. Had let her grief and her rage turn her into a monster without so much as a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time Agatha had even thought to be remorseful, the damage was done. And it wouldn’t have been fair to apologize even if she’d wanted to, would it? Because even if she could ever earn Rio’s forgiveness- could ever forgive Rio herself- she couldn’t trust herself not to hurt her again. Not to sink her teeth in at the first whiff of blood in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Agatha had done what was best and built the walls higher, keeping everyone far enough away that the only person her rage could burn was herself and showing her teeth when they came too close.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then Rio came back. And again, and again, and now they’re sitting a mere four feet apart on a Wednesday night watching
     <em>
      Criminal Minds
     </em>
     all these years later like it’s nothing. Like Agatha isn’t coming apart at the seams.
    </p>

     Agatha feels herself starting to shatter and tightens her grip on all of her fractured pieces, focusing on not letting Rio see her fall apart and ignoring the sharp edges digging into her palms. It was a bad idea to let Rio in tonight and to make the offer the other week. She's had a great many bad ideas lately, it seems.

     The plot line plays out on the screen- the victim is saved just in the nick of time, the unsub is in cuffs. It's a job well done even if the people from the beginning of the show are still dead. Even if the blood stains will never come out of the carpet. When Agatha finally looks over again, Rio is asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s curled up in a throw blanket on the other end of the couch, half buried in her hoodie. Her hair is fuzzy from rubbing against the pillows. The glow of the TV illuminates the frizz like a halo around her head. Rio looks younger this way, the purple bags under her eyes less prominent and the crease between her brows momentarily smooth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wants to shake her awake and kick her out so she can be free from the rising waters of their shared past choking in her lungs, from this god awful, all-consuming
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     that won’t let itself be filed down into something as simple as lust or loathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wants to slip into the space between Rio’s body and the couch and stay there until they mold into one, until the whole world disappears and there is no painful past to drown her or terrifying future waiting ahead, only skin on skin. She just wants a moment to put down her grief and her guilt and her remorse and let the animal of her body feel safe, even if it isn't real. But she can't.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fearing what she’ll do if she follows the train of thought any further, Agatha quietly rises to go through the routine of turning off all the lights, double checking that the front door is locked and tossing the now cool pan in the trash. She adds an extra blanket on the couch near Rio’s feet, knowing that they always get cold in the night. If this was five years ago, Agatha would dig out a pair of fuzzy socks and slide them on for her, thinking nothing of it. Actually, if this was five years ago, Agatha would press a kiss to her temple before pulling her up the stairs and to bed so that she wouldn't wake up tomorrow with a sore back. As it is, the extra blanket will have to suffice.
    </p>
    <p>
     The stairs feel more daunting this time, her body growing heavier and heavier beneath the full weight of the evening as it bears down. When Agatha finally drags herself into the familiar comfort of her bed, she releases the hold on her shattered remains and watches them all clatter to the floor, letting the tears come.
    </p>
    <p>
     She can’t help but feel a faint jab of amusement at the poetic irony in Rio sleeping soundly on the other side of the house while she cries in this room.
    </p>
    <p>
     She can’t help but know that there’s no part of this pain that she doesn’t deserve.
