     Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Agatha is a legacy at Westview Academy, born into privilege in terms of wealth but not in terms of affection or love of any kind. She does what she can to fit in according to her parents' standards, but there's a basketball player at her school that might be turning that all on its head.

      Amor Prohibido
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha Harkness grew up with a lot of privileges. She had nannies and maids and tutors who did everything they could do to help her succeed in all aspects of her life. She had a large house with a nice big room that she could call her own. She had all the newest toys and gadgets and books and any little thing her heart desired. Her father had made sure of it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      What she didn’t have was the love of her family.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She’d known since she was very small that her mother had no interest in raising children. Evanora Harkness had never told her this, of course, but Agatha had surmised it from the way the woman had refused to so much as offer her a smile across the dinner table, the way she ignored any attempts at conversation by rolling her eyes and walking away pretty much anytime Agatha tried to speak to her, and the way she looked at Agatha sometimes: like she was a bug that needed to be squashed underfoot as soon as possible.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was certain that her father was the only reason she was alive, but that didn’t mean that
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       he
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      treated her much better. After all, the second she was old enough, he had her sent away to a boarding school several states away, in Georgia, which was hot and humid and made Agatha’s already curly hair puff up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But it was a good school, her father had said. The best in the country, he said. And she would be a legacy. This was, after all, where he had met not only his fellow business partners, but also
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       her
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      mother. Perhaps, he said, she would meet her future husband there, as well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha doubted it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had known even as a young child that she didn’t really have an attraction for
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       boys
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . She found them…loud. And annoying. And just
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       too much
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . She hated the ones that tugged on her braids and ran away from her. She hated even more that
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       she
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      was the one who got in trouble the first time she chased one down, sat on his back, and forced him to eat dirt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her parents had not spoken to her for a week after that, forcing her to take all her meals in her room with her nanny, who tried her best to console her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It did not work.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t ever chase another boy and make him eat dirt, again, but she did find other ways to put them in their place, so to speak. She was smarter than them, stronger than them, tougher than them in other ways that made her superior. She would often catch the eyes of a few of the boys in her class, glaring at her when the teacher announced that, once again, Agatha Harkness was the top in her class.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This had the added bonus of her father expressing his pride in her, with a little pat on her head and a framed certificate on the wall in the hallway that led to her bedroom, on the opposite side of the house from her parents’ bedroom. He even bought her a small cake to celebrate the occasion just before she left for boarding school to begin ninth grade.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was probably the most Agatha could have asked for from him. Her mother didn’t even show up at the airport to see her off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Agatha arrived at the school, Westview Academy, which was small, proudly boasting a student population of less than three hundred of the country’s best and brightest, she came to realize that there was a wide distinction between the students as well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There were students like her - legacies and other kids from good, wealthy families who could pay the steep tuition without even blinking an eye - and the
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       others
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . Namely, the scholarship students.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Of these, there were few. Only ten per grade.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      One of these was Rio Vidal, who was at Westview on a sports scholarship. She played basketball on the girl’s team, which was, admittedly, the best in the country, having led Westview to win the national championship ten times in the last twenty years. Rio Vidal transferred from a school in New York halfway through junior year. Rumors surrounded her entrance to Westview about his expulsion from Mt. Joy Academy, but she ignored them, focusing on her studies and winning games as Westview’s newest Shooting Guard.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And she was
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       good
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , Agatha had to admit. She usually didn’t enjoy any kind of sports - or really anything that would distract her from her studies - but basketball was an institution at Westview. All of her friends and classmates were going to the games, so Agatha went, too. She sat on the bleachers, reading a book while her friends cheered around her. Agatha cheered, too, sometimes, but the games were terribly boring.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Until
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Rio
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was three games into the season when Agatha sat down at a floor seat with a few of her friends, opening to the bookmarked page in her novel, her eyes drinking in the words on the page as her friend, Willow, cheered next to her. The Westview Witches came out to thunderous applause as their mascot, a green-skinned, warty old hag danced around, pretending to fly a broom. Agatha rolled her eyes when Willow tried to tug her to her feet. She brushed her off, slumping a bit as she tried to refocus on her page.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, suddenly, Wisty the Westview Witch plucked the book from her hand, putting on a show of skimming through it as the crowd laughed. Agatha attempted to get the book back, but Wisty was taller than her, holding her back as the crowd continued to laugh. Agatha’s face burned with embarrassment and she felt tears start to burn in her eyes as Wisty tossed the book aside, waggling her finger at Agatha in a disapproving manner before dancing off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha fought past the lump in her throat, glaring at the book on the floor, her bookmark sitting several feet away from it, warring with herself over whether she should go and retrieve it or just continue to sit there. She swallowed thickly, trying to keep the tears from spilling out, when she saw a figure, with raven black in a ponytail, crouching down to pick up the book. They walked toward her, scooping up the simple purple bookmark on their way to her seat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s face flushed at the sight of the person’s face, immediately recognizing Rio Vidal - the new girl, who also lived in her dorm, just two doors down - and that little lopsided smirk of hers. It was more sympathetic now, more genuine. She crouched down in front of Agatha, her brown-eyed gaze soft on the other girl.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you okay?” she mouthed, furrowing her brow when she was certain that Agatha was the only one who could see her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded, taking the book and bookmark from her hands. “I’m fine,” she replied. “Thanks.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just nodded at her before she stood and ran back onto the court to start the game. Agatha watched after her, her entire body feeling warm as she clutched the book to her chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I hear she’s one of those scholarship kids,” Willow said, leaning over to whisper in Agatha’s ear. “Her parents are, like, migrant farmers or something, so they had to send her to boarding school while they traveled around. She’s been kicked out of, like, six schools already. I can’t
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       believe
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      they let her into Westview just because she can toss a ball through some netting.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t act like you’re not impressed,” Agatha huffed in return, suddenly feeling incensed. “You’re the biggest basketball freak I know.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Willow scoffed. “We’ll see,” she said, crossing her arms over her chest. “She probably isn’t even that good.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The Witches scored 106 points that first game. Rio Vidal scored 57 of those points. Willow’s jaw was practically on the ground, and Agatha’s book remained in her lap the entire time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      At some point, Agatha stopped bringing books to the girls’ basketball games and she stopped going to the boys’ games altogether. Barely anybody went to the boys’ games, anyway. They weren’t
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       nearly
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      half as good as the girls’. And most of that was because of Rio Vidal.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was like a machine, running up and down the court while barely breaking a sweat, dribbling the ball with ease and doing all kinds of tricks while dodging other players, passing and faking and catching and shooting three-pointers like it all came so naturally to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She led the team to another championship, and Agatha found herself genuinely interested in basketball for the first time in her entire life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Or, at least,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       one
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      basketball
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       player
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her friends still talked shit about Rio, like they did about any scholarship kid, especially ones with rumors that surrounded them like Rio. Rio never confirmed nor denied the rumors, either, ignoring the whispers that followed her around as if she just didn’t give a shit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha truly admired her for that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She saw her, sometimes, in the cafeteria, sitting with the other scholarship students. The two she hung out with in particular were Jen Kale and Alice Wu. Jen Kale was on the basketball team with her and had been the first one to welcome Rio to the school. She was the Point Guard. The other one, Alice, was the daughter of a once-famous pop star named Lorna Wu, who had a few hits in the eighties and nineties, but nothing since. Alice had learned how to play pretty much every kind of instrument, however, and her scholarship reflected that. She was in special music classes, even teaching some of the younger students.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The three of them were thick as thieves, looking as though they were having a lot of fun together. Agatha was kind of jealous of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I heard they’re all lesbians,” Willow whispered in her ear when she caught Agatha looking at them one day.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What?” Agatha asked, blushing, as she turned to stare at her. “Where’d you hear that?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Brit told Starly,” Willow said, rolling her eyes. “She saw Alice and Jen making out in the bathroom once. It’d be no surprise if that Rio girl was like that, too, you know? Disgusting.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha frowned, glancing back at Rio and her friends for a moment before looking back down at her food. “Yeah,” she agreed, softly. “Disgusting.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      After the basketball season ended, Agatha was able to mostly forget about Rio. She only really saw her in the halls after that. They had no classes together, so it was easy to avoid her - not that Agatha was avoiding her, of course, but they didn’t really run in the same circles, so she just didn’t have to see her that often. She definitely wasn’t turning in the opposite direction whenever she caught Rio’s eye or ducking around corners or anything. No, of course not. That would be crazy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She spent two months over summer break forgetting about Rio Vidal as much as she could, laying out by the pool or going to the beach with the kids of her father’s friends, or just hanging out in her bedroom, reading or reorganizing her room or researching colleges she could go to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She found herself looking at colleges with good girls’ basketball teams, wondering if they’d send recruiters to boarding schools like Westview…
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When she got back to school, she found that Willow, who had been her roommate for all three years at Westview, had made a room transfer request. Willow had, of course, told her nothing about this and had even blocked Agatha from her phone and all social media, which Agatha got over quickly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had never really liked Willow that much. She was the daughter of one of her father’s old friends, so she had felt pressured to be friends with her so as not to cause some kind of drama in her parents’ social circle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Still, that more or less left her without a place to go as Willow had retained their dorm room, leaving Agatha out in the cold. For a moment, at least.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had been ordered to go to the Dorm Advisory office for a new rooming assignment on the first day of the semester. She didn’t have much in the way of luggage, only needing to lug her rolling suitcase and a duffel bag along with her backpack with her to the office.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There, she found Rio Vidal with her feet propped up on an old, beat up suitcase with about a hundred stickers littered across its dented surface. She offered Agatha that same old lopsided grin that made her face flush when she saw the tiny gap between her front teeth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You cut your hair,” Agatha blurted out as she sat down two seats away from Rio. “I mean…it looks nice.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It looked better than nice. Rio’s hair fell around her cheeks, curly and wild on her head. Agatha could even see that the hair underneath had been shaved, giving her a nice undercut. Rio carded her fingers through her hair, smirking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thanks,” she said. “Your hair looks good, too, Harkness.” Agatha blushed at that, tugging at the end of one of her braids. “So,” Rio said, “what are you in for?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “My roommate kicked me out,” Agatha sighed, rolling her eyes. “Totally ghosted me, too.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sorry to hear that,” Rio said, sounding genuinely sympathetic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What about you?” Agatha asked. This was the longest conversation she’d ever had with Rio. She thought she was doing pretty well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “My roommate lost her scholarship,” Rio said, grimacing. “I’m just here to get another placement before the term starts, you know?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded. “Obviously,” she said, motioning to her own bags.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, Agatha, there you are, dear,” Headmistress Davis said, coming out into the waiting room. “I’m so glad to see you. Well, I’m sure by now you both know that we’ve hit a bit of a snag when it comes to rooming this year. Thankfully, you two are the only ones without rooms and one has
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       just
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      opened up in Cooper Hall.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Cooper?” Rio asked, eyes widening. “Really?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Cooper Hall was more a collection of
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       suites
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      than actual dorm rooms. Usually the only students that were placed there came from the wealthiest, most influential families. They had their own private
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       bathrooms
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . Even Agatha had never dreamed of stepping foot there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course!” the headmistress said, her voice as cheery and bright as ever. “It’s the
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       least
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      we can do for two of our brightest and most talented students! Agatha, as I’m sure you’re already aware, you’ve made the short list for Valedictorian this year. And Miss
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Vidal
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , you’ve led our school to victory once again! And you girls are seniors this year, so you’ve more than earned the right to a little luxury for your last year. That is, of course, if you’re fine with rooming together.” She looked between Agatha and Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Agatha first, and Agatha waited a moment before looking back, trying to force back the flush she just
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       knew
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      was written all over her cheeks. Her heart started to pound and she was feeling a little light-headed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I heard they’re all lesbians. Disgusting
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Willow’s words echoed in her ear and Agatha tried to brush them away as she nodded to Headmistress Davis.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m fine with it,” she said. “I mean…it’s Cooper Hall.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The headmistress gave her a brilliant smile. “Wonderful!” she exclaimed, turning to the other girl. “Miss Vidal?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, too. “Sounds good to me,” she said. “Is there a valet that can take our bags or…?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The headmistress let out a laugh. “Unfortunately not,” she said. “But it’s not too far from here. Let me give you your room number and key fobs.” She disappeared back into her office for a moment, leaving the two girls alone in the outer office.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So,” Agatha said, “you don’t, like, snore or anything, do you?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have no idea,” Rio retorted. “Nobody has ever told me that I do.” She shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s good,” Agatha said. “That’s good.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Here you go!” Headmistress Davis said. “Please let me know if you need
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       anything
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , okay girls? Have a nice semester!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thank you, Headmistress,” they chorused as they shuffled out of the office with their belongings.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The path to Cooper Hall was short, but Agatha still startled when she felt a hand tugging at her duffel bag. She turned her head to see Rio, one brow lifted, as she tugged on the bag.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What are you doing?” Agatha asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Taking one of your bags?” Rio replied. “You’re carrying a lot and that looks heavy.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m fine,” Agatha said, her face warming, “really.” Rio let go of the bag, holding up her hands in surrender. Agatha cleared her throat. “Thanks, though,” she said. “That’s thoughtful.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, well,” Rio said, “scholarships do tend to have thoughts, you know.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Huh?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Never mind.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s cheeks turned pink in the corner of Agatha’s vision as they reached the front door of Cooper Hall. Agatha waved her fob at the sensor near the front door and it turned green. She heard the clicking sound as the front door unlocked and Rio pushed it open, holding it for her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thanks,” Agatha said, offering her soft smile as she stepped into the lobby, looking at the paper Headmistress Davis had given them. “We’re in room 313.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is there an elevator in here?” Rio asked. Agatha pointed to a pair of shiny silver doors to the left. “Sweet,” she said, tugging Agatha’s bag off her shoulder to sling over her own before the other girl even knew what was happening.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey!” Agatha exclaimed, following her toward the elevators. “What the hell?!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s just easier this way,” Rio called over her shoulder, tapping the ‘up’ arrow on the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes, but she didn’t attempt to take her bag back. The ride in the elevator was short, as was the walk to their dorm room, which was really more of a suite.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had a living room and a kitchenette, fully furnished, as well as a private bathroom with a tub and separate shower.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And one bedroom. Two full-sized beds, of course, because these suites were still meant for roommates…but just one bedroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tried not to think too hard about it. Especially when she saw that they also had a freaking
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       balcony
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Which one do you want?” Rio asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, I don’t really care,” Agatha said. “You pick.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tossed Agatha’s duffel bag onto the bed nearest the balcony, then flopped down on the one nearest the door, which had a green floral comforter already set up for her. The other bed had a lilac comforter that was soft to the touch. Agatha sat down, sighing at the softness of the mattress. She laid back on it, closing her eyes. Cooper Hall really spared
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       no
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      expense, huh?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rich people have all the best shit,” Rio murmured, kicking off her sneakers. Agatha let out a noise of agreement. It wasn’t really like she could argue with that. She knew her own privilege.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When she opened her eyes, she was looking away from the window, at Rio’s face, which was looking back at her, those warm brown eyes focused on Agatha, making her feel just as warm on the inside. Agatha let herself bask in that warmth for a moment before she remembered herself, turning away as she sat up, clearing her throat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We should unpack,” she said, opening up her duffel bag and taking out her clothes. There were two separate closets in the room. Inside each was a dresser with plenty of space for their clothing. Agatha quickly transferred all of her folded laundry into the drawers, hung up her sweaters and jackets for the semester, and organized her shoes before closing the door…just in time to see Rio simply place her suitcase into the closet and shut the door halfway, leaving it there without another care in the world. “Seriously?” Agatha said. “You’re not even going to unpack that and put it all away?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged. “No need,” she said. “I didn’t bring that much, anyway, and I’m used to living out of a suitcase. Why would that change now?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh,” Agatha said, “did you move around a lot as a kid?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m sure you’ve heard all the rumors already, Legacy,” Rio snorted, sitting back down on her bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rumors aren’t facts,” Agatha retorted. “I’d like to hear the real story,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       if
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      you’d like to share it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at her, brow furrowed in something akin to confusion but not quite there yet. “Sure…” she said. “Uh…my parents are from Puerto Rico. They moved here when my mom was pregnant with me. I was born in Miami, but we were living in Houston by the time I was, like, two months old. My dad was a ranch hand on a cattle farm, and we had a little house on his boss’s property. We lived there for a few years, my mom working as a maid in the main house until we made the move to California, where dad worked as a car salesman for a few years. Still, we left before I got to school out there. Then we just kept moving around every few months, my dad getting different jobs, making a pretty decent living, but we never stayed anywhere for long.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “My mom didn’t like that, though. She didn’t think it was stable enough for me. I was pretty much finishing school by mail. I was a quick learner - like my dad - but I didn’t have much in the way of friends, you know? I never stayed anywhere long enough to make them. And I was starting to get into sports, which she wanted to encourage. So they looked into boarding schools for me. I had an academic-based scholarship in middle school, before I started playing basketball for the school team, then I was offered an athletic scholarship to play basketball at the school I was going to in Arizona. Then Mt. Joy contacted my parents when I was about to graduate from middle school to offer me a position there. I hadn’t even applied, but they’d heard about me from my basketball coach, so…” Rio shrugged, grinning. “I played there for a couple years, keeping my grades up, of course, and then…” She frowned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is it true you got expelled?” Agatha asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked away, but Agatha could see her nod. “Yeah,” she said, her voice sounding a little choked. “Not really for anything
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      did,” she said, looking back at Agatha with a sad smile. “And it’s not really considered an
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       expulsion
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      on official transcripts. They just had me transferred from Mt. Joy to Westview. They said it was better this way.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What was?” Agatha asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m sure you’ve heard all the
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       other
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      rumors surrounding me?” Rio said, looking back at Agatha. “About my…inclinations to other girls?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not in so many fancy words,” Agatha said. “But yes. I’ve heard. Did they have a ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ policy or something?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio snorted at that. “Close,” she said. “Nobody asked, and I never did the telling. But I was dating this girl. She was in the closet, though, so we were keeping it a secret. I would pass her notes in the hall. They were cute little love letters. I made sure not to put my name on them so that nobody would find out, but her roommate found them during our first semester of junior year and she just…panicked. She said that I was
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       stalking
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      her. People only believed her because we had never really been openly friends or anything, you know? I was already out as a lesbian (most of my team was openly queer), but then I was labelled a stalker and…well, there’s really no coming back from that.” She clenched her fists in the comforter. “They were originally going to do damage control and sweep it under the rug, but then the girl’s parents demanded I be kicked out of the school. She didn’t defend me at all.” Rio took a deep breath, closing her eyes for a moment before opening them. Agatha could see tears. “Now, here I am.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Her loss,” Agatha said. “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Their
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      loss, really. They lost a nationally-ranked basketball superstar over one girl’s unsubstantiated claims. They stumbled it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I think you mean
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       fumbled
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ,” Rio said, with a chuckle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I do don’t baseball.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       football
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ,” Rio laughed, shaking her head. “What about you, Harkness?” Rio asked. “How did you end up here? Last I checked, your family was from Salem.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You know my family?” Agatha asked, feeling that familiar flush spread over her cheeks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Your father is pretty well-known for manufacturing farm machinery,” Rio said. “Harkness and Co. is written on pretty much every machine I’ve ever seen my father use. It’s not hard to put two and two together.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, that makes sense,” Agatha said, chuckling nervously. “Um, yeah, well my dad grew up in Georgia,” she said. “My mom did, too. They both attended this school, met, and got married after graduation. He met some of his business partners here, too, and they moved up to Salem to start their little machinery plant, I guess.” She shrugged. “He explained it to me once, but I didn’t really listen all that much.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Aren’t you on the business track?” Rio asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, but that doesn’t mean I have to go into
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       farm machinery
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ,” Agatha snorted. “I like the sales side a little bit more. Maybe I’ll sell something more interesting…like clothing. I like clothes. As you can see.” She motioned to her closet, which was bursting with all the clothing she’d decided she just
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       needed
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      to have at Westview, even if she didn’t intend to wear it
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       all
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      before she went home for winter break. As neatly as it was put away, she could practically still see some of it pushing against the closet door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You could do something in fashion
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       design
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      instead,” Rio suggested.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No,” Agatha said, shaking her head. “My drawing skill is shit. Besides, that’s a tough industry to break into. And my parents have already expressed their plans to cut me off the second I stop going to school, so I have to make sure I’m doing something profitable.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s…shitty,” Rio said, frowning sympathetically and ooh Agatha didn’t like that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It is what it is,” she said. “I’ll be fine. I’ll get my master’s in business and go to Gucci or something, I don’t know. I’ll get away from my parents and just…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She didn’t know what she was going to do when she left her parents behind. She had been planning to do it for years, planning to leave once she’d landed herself a stable career. She’d never speak to them again if she could help it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But what she’d do after, besides work to earn her living, she had no idea.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Maybe get a girlfriend? She
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       certainly
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      couldn’t do that while she was still living under their roof. Her mother’s
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       head
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      would explode.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Just…?” Rio prompted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shrugged. “I’ll figure it out,” she said, standing up and dusting off her jeans and sweater. “You hungry? I’m
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       starving
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ? Want to go to the cafeteria?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Uh, sure,” Rio said. “You’re not gonna be embarrassed to be seen with a scholarship, Legacy?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Stop calling me that,” Agatha huffed, strutting through the suite to the door with Rio on her trail. “Nobody’s gonna care, least of all me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mmhmm,” Rio said, watching as Agatha opened the door and looked in both directions, checking that the coast was clear. “If you say so,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Legacy
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      People, it seemed,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       did
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      care that Agatha Harkness, daughter of Christopher and Evanora Harkness, was rooming with a
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       scholarship
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      student. And not just
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       any
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      scholarship student, either, but
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Rio Vidal
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , who was expected to lead them to another championship victory.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Still, she
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       was
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      a scholarship student.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       And
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      she was rumored to be a troublemaker who had been expelled from her last school (though she’d never given anybody a problem at Westview) as well as a lesbian.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had worried that the last part would get back to her parents, but, by the time she went home for the mid-year break, neither of her parents seemed to hear anything about it. She’d seen Willow at a New Year’s Eve party, hanging onto the arm of some guy who was the heir to a tech billionaire, and ignored her when she began to whisper in her companion’s ear, looking not-so-subtly in Agatha’s direction.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t waste a single glance on her, laughing at a text Rio had sent her of a giant hand with the middle finger sticking straight up she’d made on a farm in Minnesota, where her father was working brewing beer. Agatha sent back a picture of the sad little snowman she’d tried to make with the minimal amount of snow they’d gotten in Salem so far that year.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Frosty’s not looking very chill this winter, huh?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had snort-laughed at that, getting a few odd looks from the people around her as well as a glare from her mother who had
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       warned her about that laugh.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes as she heart-reacted the text, putting her phone back into her pocket as she went back to
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       tolerating
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      the party.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When she got back to Georgia at the beginning of January, she found herself excited to get back to Cooper Hall, missing her roommate more than anything else. She had never really thought that Rio would be anything more than some girl on the basketball team to her, even
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       after
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      they became roommates.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But then they’d started spending more time together, studying for tests and binge-watching television shows, recommending books to one another, and just enjoying each other’s company. By the end of that first semester, Agatha was starting to feel
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       affection
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      for the other girl.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This was
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       not
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      a feeling she was familiar with, but she could think of nothing else it could be. Cancer, maybe? Did Cancer make your stomach flutter and cause heart palpitations?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That felt like something Cancer would do.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But Agatha
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       liked
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      this feeling. And it was mostly absent while she was back in her hometown, sleeping in her own, very silent, very big, very
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       lonely
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She let herself into the building, her duffel bag slung over her shoulder as she rode up in the elevator. Rio had sent her a text earlier that morning to let Agatha know that she’d made it to campus already and had gone shopping for some groceries to keep in the little fridge in their kitchenette. They had gotten used to having their own food, being able to cook on the electric stove that Cooper Hall had given them to use. They’d had to go out and buy a set of pots and pans and dishes and silverware and cups and everything that one might need for a kitchen, but that was okay because Rio was a pretty amazing cook.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       not
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio blamed it on her upbringing. She promised to teach Agatha a few recipes before the year was out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha could smell something cooking as she stepped off the elevator, and she could tell that it was coming from
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       their
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      suite. Rarely anybody else in Cooper Hall cooked anything that was
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       that
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      good. She sighed, smiling softly as she followed her nose to her suite, placing her key in the lock and pushing open the door, smiling as she was met with music playing and Rio dancing around the kitchen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Amor prohibido murmuran por las calles
      </span>

<em>

      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio danced as she sang, making something on the stove that smelled
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       so
      </span>
</em>

      good that Agatha’s stomach immediately started to grumble. The song that played from her phone speakers was familiar, too. Not the song, but the voice. Rio had listened to this singer a lot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Who is this?” Agatha asked. Rio jumped slightly, turning around. Her cheeks were flushed with embarrassment, her eyes wide as she turned the music down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Selena,” she said. “Singer from the 90’s, you know?
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Bidi bidi bom bom
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I think I’ve heard
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       you
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      listen to it before,” Agatha said, “but my parents were not into Spanish music.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Shocker,” Rio snorted, turning down the heat before opening her arms for Agatha, who immediately stepped into them. “Welcome back.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had never really been a hugger before Rio, either. But Rio had kind of wormed her way into Agatha’s arms too many times after big accomplishments - like Agatha’s early decision acceptance into American University in DC, where she had a scholarship already waiting for her. Agatha melted into the embraces now, which had become
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       very
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      commonplace.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Now was no exception as the song continued to play in the background, not quite as loud. Rio was moving to the rhythm in Agatha’s arms, coaxing her to dance as well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Que importa que dira
      </span>
</em>
<em>
<span>

</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>

<em>

<em>

</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
       Te quiero.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha flushed at that, her cheeks warm as Rio led her in a silly dance that belied the emotional words of the song. Agatha didn’t know a lot of Spanish, but ‘te quiero’ was almost universal. Her heart flipped in her chest as she stared into Rio’s eyes allowing her to lead her in dance as she continued to sing with the music.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Amor prohibido murmuran por las calles
      </span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
       Porque somos de distintas sociedades
      </span>
</em>
<em>

<em>

      </span>
</em>
<em>

</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
       Ni en el corazon oh, oh baby.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt herself drawn in by the words she sang despite not knowing what most of it meant. The passion in her voice as she sang, the smoothness of her words, the well-practiced tongue curling around each one, the sincerity in her gaze…
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned in, brushing her lips against Rio’s before she could stop herself. She felt Rio’s sharp intake of breath and immediately pulled away, out of her arms, placing her hand over her mouth as she locked eyes with Rio’s wide brown eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       so
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      sorry,” she said. “I don’t…I’m so sorry. Oh my god.” She grabbed her duffel bag and rushed into the bedroom, through her bag and herself down onto her bed, pressing her face into her pillow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She heard the music shut off and Rio shuffling around for a minute before there was a knock at the open door. “Can I come in?” Rio whispered, cautiously. God, Agatha hated that she felt she had to be cautious around her now because Agatha just
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       could not
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      control herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes,” Agatha said, turning her face to the side, away from Rio. “Of course. This is your room, too. I’m so sorry that I–”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t be,” Rio said, and Agatha felt the side of her bed dip a little as Rio sat down by her hip. “I…I didn’t mind it.” Her voice sounded so quiet, so shy and unlike herself. Agatha
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       hated
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      that she had done that to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Still,” Agatha said, sitting up, still avoiding Rio’s gaze as she looked down at her lap, “I shouldn’t have done that. Not without your consent. It was very
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       arrogant
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      of me to–”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha,” Rio huffed, placing her hand underneath Agatha’s chin, forcing her to meet her eye. “You
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       have
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      my consent,” she said, her eyebrows lifting, her voice genuine. “You have my consent
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       right now
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . I thought…I thought you knew that.” She took a deep breath, snorting a little. “Actually, that’s a lie. I thought…I thought you wouldn’t ever want to–”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned forward again, pressing her lips to Rio’s for the second time, allowing herself to sink into Rio’s embrace as the other woman wrapped her around Agatha’s waist, pulling her tightly against her body as their lips moved together. Agatha felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up, the fluttering in her stomach more active than ever before. Her heart was swelling with affection and something else that she dare not name.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When the need for oxygen became too much, she broke the kiss, pressing her forehead to Rio’s as she struggled to breathe, her hands holding onto the other girl’s hips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m sorry,” Agatha said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha…” Rio sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not…for kissing you,” Agatha said, rubbing her nose against Rio’s with a soft smile. “For…
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       not
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      kissing you, for so long. I should have done this
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       ages
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ago.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “On that,” Rio said, “I think we can agree.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But I can’t…” Agatha pulled back with an apologetic look. “I’m not out,” she said. “I
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       can’t
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      be out. My parents are…” She shook her head. “Well, you know,” she said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had never come out to Rio - or anybody, for that matter - but she had
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       heavily
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      implied that she hated how bigoted her parents were, how much they hated anybody different from them. Both Christopher and Evanora Harkness were outspoken against ‘The Gays’ and openly funded campaigns that aimed to strip them of their rights. Rio had known about their company, so there was no way she didn’t know about their political stances, especially with how often Agatha had complained about them to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know,” Rio said. “I don’t care. I don’t want you any less. And I know how to keep a secret, so long as you don’t accuse me of being your stalker.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha snorted, pressing another kiss to Rio’s lips. It was meant to be quick, but Rio deepened it, pressing her hand to the back of Agatha’s head. Agatha didn’t protest, cupping Rio’s cheeks in her hands. Rio’s hands wrapped themselves around her wrists.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How have I gone so long without doing this?” Agatha practically moaned, pulling away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have no idea,” Rio gasped out, “but I fully encourage you to do it as often as you want. I don’t care if I’m mid-sentence, just…go for it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha snorted, shaking her head. “You are so gay,” she huffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So are you,” Rio teased, poking her in the ribs. Agatha let out a surprised laugh that ended in a snort, her hands flying up to cover her mouth and nose as a delighted smile spread across Rio’s lips. “Was that a snort?” she asked. “Did you just
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       snort
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ? Does
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha Harkness
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      have a snorty laugh?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No! You’ve heard me laugh before,” Agatha huffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not enough times, apparently,” Rio said. “Because you just
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       snorted
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      !”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I did not!” Agatha groaned, pressing her face to Rio’s shoulder. “Shut up.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Just when I thought you couldn’t get more attractive,” Rio said, pressing a kiss to her temple. “God, I have had it bad for you since that game.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pulled back. “Game?” she asked. “What game?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “When the dumbass mascot threw your book?” Rio said. “And I picked it up for you?
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       That
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      game.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That was when we first met,” Agatha huffed. “There’s no way…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You are so gorgeous,” Rio said, softly, cupping Agatha’s cheeks again. “Your eyes are so blue and your lips are so…” She pressed another kiss to said lips. “When I handed you that book, you gave me a look that nearly knocked me on my ass. I thought…I
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       never
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      thought you’d ever…” She took a deep breath, grinning, “but here we are. Roommates. Kissing roommates.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This is very cliche of us,” Agatha said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Cliches are cliche for a reason,” Rio said, pushing a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear, delighting in the redness of her cheeks. “People
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       love
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      cliches.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes, but she didn’t say anything, pressing her lips against Rio’s again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They sat there for a while, just kissing softly, before a low rumbling in Agatha’s stomach interrupted them. Rio pulled away, glancing down with a smirk. “I think somebody is hungry,” she said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Starved,” Agatha huffed. “Is that food ready?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Just about,” Rio said, standing up and offering her hand, tugging Agatha off the bed. “But I was interrupted by a
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       very
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      important manner that I had to deal with right away.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s heart swelled with affection again, her arm winding around Rio’s waist as they stepped back into the kitchenette, where the food was still sitting on the stove. It was off and there was aluminum foil over the mixture of meat, peppers, and potatoes that Rio had been cooking. She turned the stove back on, reaching for her phone to resume the song that had been playing as she stirred the food. Agatha perched herself on a stool at the counter, which counted as their dining room table for all intents and purposes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What is this song about, anyway?” she asked, watching as Rio danced a little bit as she stirred the food around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Two people falling in love when it’s frowned upon in their society,” Rio informed her. “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Amor Prohibido
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      literally means
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Forbidden Love
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . Specifically, it’s about a poor woman declaring her love for her significant other despite what anybody else thinks of their relationship.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       El dinero no importa en ti ni en mi
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      means ‘money doesn’t matter to you or me’ and
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       solo el nuestro amor
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      means ‘only our love’.” She grinned at Agatha. “Kinda romantic, don’t you think?” she asked, her eyes twinkling as she shut off the stove again, turning to reach for a couple of plates from the cupboard.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes,” Agatha murmured softly, smiling at Rio as she plated their food, “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       incredibly
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Aquí tienes, mi corazon
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ,” Rio said, sliding the plate over to her, leaning in to press a kiss to Agatha’s lips.
